we're looking at the most important
comparison in PC gaming history about so
grand that you simply won't know what to
do with yourself after you've seen these
two performance powerhouses battle it
out well maybe not but I will be
comparing two very popular mobile
processes in the most popular game out
there right now and that is of course
fortnight the two processes we're
looking at today are the Intel Core i5
8250 you and the AMD risin 520 500 you
these two CPUs are designed for
mid-range ultra-thin laptops down to 13
inches in size or smaller and both
packed edp's of just 15 watts so we're
looking at the best available options
from both Intel and AMD in this category
importantly we're looking at the
performance of integrated graphics in
this comparison our test laptops did not
include discrete graphics this is key
because there are tons of laptops out
there that use just a CPU and don't
feature discrete GPUs and people still
want to play Fortnight on those sorts of
systems so this comparison will look at
how Intel and AMD is offering stack up
when you try and play Fortnight on the
integrated GPUs and what sort of quality
settings you can use to achieve the best
performance if good levels of
performance are possible at all
a quick rundown of the specs the Core i5
8250 U is a quad core processor with
clock speeds ranging from 1.6 to 3.4
gigahertz and there's also an integrated
UHD 620 GPU with 24 execution units
clocked up to 1,100 megahertz
the Rison 5 2500 you also has a quad
core CPU this time clocked between 2.0
and 3.6 gigahertz there's also a Vega 8
GPU with 512 shader cores clocked up to
1,100 megahertz
on paper the Rison apu has a significant
GPU advantage but we'll soon see how
that translates in fortnight and if you
curious what test laptops were using the
core i5 8252 is inside the LG gram 13
with 8 gigabytes of ddr4 memory while
the arisin 5 2500 u is inside the HP
Envy x-360 13 also with 8 gigabytes of
ddr4 memory we've reviewed both of these
systems in the past in case you are
curious about them so you can go back
and check out those reviews if you
missed them
so let's first take a look at how
Fortnight performs at a native 1080p
using the lowest detail settings
naturally these sorts of integrated GPS
aren't going to be good enough to play
the game on anything but the lowest
settings and for the most part the
resolution will be the deciding factor
between a playable and unplayable
experience anyway here we have 49 at
1080p and the difference between the two
mobile processes are quite large the
Rison 5 2500 you on the right isn't
exactly delivering a great experience at
less than 30 FPS with dips as low as 24
FPS or so giving it that nice cinematic
framerate that everyone loves
but it's the core i5 8250 you that
really struggles at 1080p running at
below 20 fps for most of the test run
when you get into a firefight at less
than 20 fps it's pretty hard to cut hop
Victorious as you can see from this
gameplay footage for some dumb reason I
decided to create this benchmark run on
the 8250 u system at 1080p with this
sort of performance and I played a few
rounds and struggled massively in all of
them a stuttery 20 fps just isn't good
enough to play fortnight to achieve a
mere 30 FPS on the Rison 5 2500 u system
I had to reduce the render resolution to
900 P which still isn't fantastic for a
competitive game like fortnight but
we're beginning to get into the realms
of playability aside from a few brief
drops below 30 fps and this resolution
fought and I hovered around 35 fps
however 900p isn't good enough for the
8250 we're still playing at 25 FPS or so
which sucks and with long stretches of
game played down around 20 FPS and of
course the GPU is picked at a hundred
percent consistently with quite low CPU
utilization
it's 720p where the Rison 5 2500 uhit's
a sweet spot between performance and
visual quality you really don't want to
reduce the resolution any further on a
1080p display but 720p is quite playable
without looking like absolute garbage
it's certainly getting there but it's
not only absolute garbage on the 2500
you running the game at 720p delivers at
least 40 FPS with the occasional dip
into the high 30s but most you sit
between 40 and 50 FPS while it's not a
locked 60 FPS you have to remember we're
playing the game on an ultra thin laptop
with just a 15 watt APU there's
not a lot of power of thermal Headroom
in this sort of device so to achieve mid
40 FPS at 720p is very impressive and
that's a perfectly playable sort of
experience it's even more impressive
when displayed next to the 8250 U at
720p Intel's offering barely reaches 30
FPS at this resolution with dips below
30 fps quite common in more intense
areas I'm sure some players will be fine
with 30 FPS but when you can get 10 to
15 FPS more on the rise and 5 2500 you
that's what I'd prefer for sure it's a
bit of a nightmare trying to hit a
consistent 60 FPS on either of these
processes even when you do get large
stretches of gameplay well above 60 FPS
you can still get dips below with that
said you need to turn down the
resolution quite far on each system to
achieve this level of performance on the
Rison 5 2500 you're looking at a 540 PE
resolution while on the 8250 you'll need
a garbage 360p and the game won't let
you go below 360 P so at that point
you're playing on literally the lowest
settings to the game allows I mentioned
just before that I found 40 to 50 FPS to
be quite playable in the Rison 5 2500
you at 720p so here I've put that beside
equivalent settings that achieve that
performance on the core i5 a 250 you
unfortunately for Intel CPU owners the
resolution required for that performance
is 4 ACP which when put besides 720p
shows a large difference in visual
quality 720p isn't amazing but at 480p
it becomes difficult to spot enemies at
a distance or really spot any details
whatsoever so not impossible to plant
480p but you definitely add a
competitive disadvantage compared to
those running at higher resolutions so I
think this look at fortnight on the core
i5 8250 you and Rison 5 2500 you won't
surprise many people that have looked at
reviews for either processor it's well
known that the 2500 u has a
significantly faster integrated vaguer
GPU than the Intel HD graphics found in
the core i5 when both processes are
found in the same sorts of laptops you
should be a little cat 4 rise in MOBA if
you're interested in playing fortnight
or games of similar visual quality on a
13-inch ultra portable you won't get a
great experience on either system and
playing at a consistent
60 FPS is difficult without ridiculously
low resolutions but the risin 5 2500 you
to live is above 30 fps at 900 P and a
quite playable 42 50 FPS at 720p whereas
the core i5 8250 you can't hit a solid
30 FPS at 720p and it's really only at
480p where you're hitting that above 40
fps sweet spot with these sorts of
results a generally classed fortnight as
unplayable on the core i5 8250 you while
on the Rison v 2500 oooh you can play
the game on low quality settings and an
acceptable enough resolution and frame
rate again that's pretty impressive
considering this process it is found in
a slim and light 13-inch system like the
HP Envy x-360 it's the first 15 watt
class processor I've tested where you
can genuinely play this sort of game
without a discrete GPU a few other final
notes it's actually a lot easier to play
fortnight on the rise and 5 2500 you in
general the 8250 use stutters a lot at
random while I didn't have that issue
with rice and mobile also changing
settings and especially resolutions on
the 8250 u system often implemented a 30
FPS cap for no reason despite vsync and
fortnight's frame cap being disabled I
couldn't find any setting or reason as
to why this would be occurring but
having a 30 FPS Kappa P out of nowhere
is pretty annoying
Rison Mobile is limited to 60 fps but
honestly that's fine considering the
performance this apu delivers that's it
for this one bit of a quick look at
fortnight for those interested in these
low-power laptops I know there are tons
of people out there that buy these sorts
of systems and want to know if they can
play games on them usually the answer is
no especially if it entails 15-watt
parts but now with rising mobile on the
market it's a bit of a different story
