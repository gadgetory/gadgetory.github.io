gonna discuss a few things that we
normally avoid talking about on the main
channel mostly because it's stuff that
we don't really want to get bogged down
by but as the AMD and Intel battle
continues to heat up and perhaps we'll
see the same thing between ambien and
video soon I felt there were a few
things that we probably should address
recently I revisited the core i5 7600 K
and Verizon v 1600 and in that video I
focused on gaming performance looking at
newly-released titles and the results
were interesting where is the 7600 K
once ran rings around the Rison
processor today it struggles in a number
of titles for the most part that content
was well received the video has a
healthy like to dislike ratio and
generally speaking the feedback was
excellent however as always with these
comparisons there was those that got a
bit upset believing Amy had paid for the
content to be produced you know the
usual shill comments and all that noise
I know you guys often say things like
Steve you don't need to explain yourself
we trust you and your work speaks for
itself and yeah I really do appreciate
that but we still like to address this
sort of stuff from time to time that
said on the main channel we don't
usually talk about the goings-on in the
industry too much and that's because
it's either taken the wrong way or it
just creates too much drama
obviously we expose the Intel principle
technologies Fiasco and we were the
first to do so closely followed by our
good friends over at gamers Nexus who
created some excellent content on that
subject as well we've been hard but fair
on in video recently with their strange
sampling behavior and silliness with
drivers but that's all stuff that
affects you more directly obviously
you'll see misleading paid-for
benchmarks and you'll also notice when
certain media outlets who normally
provide day 1 reviews don't the things
we don't really talk about is the stuff
that we're often accused of like paid
reviews which we know happen in this
industry but obviously we don't take
part in them
as an example we were approached late
last year to put together some paid
Intel reviews not buy-in told directly
but rather a marketing agency that
represents them it's possible the
agencies are being used as a scapegoat
when doing this
but who knows if Intel's even aware we
certainly don't have evidence that they
are anyway we declined to the lucrative
offer without getting too much
information but we know the most recent
example was for paid core i7 79 80 XE
and obtained reviews and sadly we know a
few youtubers did take them up on the
offer thankfully though they did
disclose the sponsorship though I'm not
entirely sure viewers knew exactly what
they are watching and what the
requirements set by the marketing agency
were basically all the paid offers that
we've come across have conditions such
as you can't talk about competing
products in fact you can't mention
competing brands at all in the case of
the 79 ad XE content there was to be no
mention of thread Ripper or AMD you
can't say anything negative about the
product and it suggested that any
potential negatives such as high price
tags should be justified to the audience
the reviews usually need to be submitted
for approval to make sure they're
projecting the right message these
companies aren't after lukewarm
recommendations so you won't get a
well-balanced conclusion that notes the
cons and pros rather message is buy this
because well just insert some reasons
and that makes paid reviews pretty
obvious to spot now don't mistake
positive reviews as paid reviews rather
look for reviews that omit obvious flaws
and act like the product or brand has no
competition worth mentioning now we'll
just say this level of scrutiny for a
pre-roll ad is fine as that is obviously
paid advertising and very different from
a paid review that said we still do our
best to vet advertisers and because of
that we do knock back something like 10
times more offers than we actually
accept on that note Hardware canucks put
out a tweet earlier this month talking
about this very issue basically they
were concerned by the large volume of
paid review requests or offers I suppose
they weren't requesting to do paid
reviews just to make that clear
there was companies offering to pay them
for reviews so hopefully that makes that
clear and they were quite alarmed by
this as it suggests it's common practice
for these companies to pay for reviews
it was good to see a major player in the
tech YouTube space shedding some light
on this issue
you're just also mention that I know
others such as gamers Nexus have also
talked about this problem on occasion as
well so hats off to them today we've
only discussed this issue with our
patreon members on the monthly live
streams and quite a few members have
been pushing us to bring this issue to
the main channel now I don't expect this
information to change too much but it is
our hope that the more we can educate
viewers about these issues the less
likely they are to occur it's probably
also worth keeping in mind for some
viewers spitting the dummy over opinions
that you don't necessarily agree with
and screaming shil doesn't help in fact
all it does is dilute the issue and help
those who are really lining their
pockets with dirty review money get away
with it
the good news is I believe the vast
majority of tech media on YouTube do
provide honest reviews at least those
focused on core PC hardware you know the
kind of content that we create I can't
really speak for other tech type media
such as guys that cover gadgets or
mobile phones because I don't really
follow those channels and I don't know
too much about them but I really do feel
for the type of tech we look at media
coverage has never been better
and I've been doing this as a full-time
job now for almost 20 years I'm sure
there are some that'll disagree claiming
something along lines that YouTube
influences just cash in when and where
they can and tech journalism is dead but
stop and think for a moment last year in
video tried to pull one of their
dirtiest tactics yet an ice AMD out of
the GPU space with their geforce partner
program how do i CP a once
well-respected tech site and i guess
they are still well respected to his day
the site's just no longer in operation
anyway hollow CP first broke the news on
in videos GPP plans it was some great
work by kyle and the gang but i feel ten
years ago it would have gone largely
unnoticed nvidia would have steamed
ahead with their plans and gamers would
have suffered today though I believe
largely thanks to youtube there's a much
wider audience for PC tech content with
so many big channels reporting on the
GeForce Partner Program Nvidia simply
couldn't get away with playing dirty and
the program was quickly scrapped to
avoid major blowback this was a massive
win for PC gamers everywhere and
honestly bass
um what these companies have gotten away
with in the past I really didn't think
it would happen and despite the GP PU in
shortly after that Fiasco we've got
another one from Intel with principal
technologies this came a week or so
before the embargo was set to be lifted
on independent third-party reviews but
we dealt with that one quite swiftly and
thankfully everyone else piled on to
help stop yet another dirty tactic for
the most part AMD has been pretty clear
of any drama recently we did stomp on
them for the misleading Radeon erics 560
branding which saw our X for 60s become
5 60s but they did address that quickly
pleading it was a misunderstanding with
retailers and we're certainly nothing
like the principal technologies report
or GPP but you can rest assured if aim D
pull any crap like that
we'll be all over it so by now most of
you know we review products individually
on their own merit
I don't consider if it's an AMD Intel or
nvidia product or any other brand for
that matter a brand really has no
bearing on the review what I do focus on
quite heavily actually very heavily is
value even for high-end products in my
mind they still have to make sense for
example the core o 999 ok is technically
a better product than the rise in 720
700 X and I've said so in the past so I
certainly don't deny that
however I'd never buy for coralline
processor for $500 u.s. when you get the
rise in 720 700 X for just $280 or the
non ex model for half the price of the
core oh 9 I simply can't justify
spending around 70% more for the Intel
CPU especially when you still have to
buy a cooler on top of that so
realistically you're looking at around
another hundred dollars to get the most
out of the core I 9 now if you don't
agree with us weighing our reviews so
heavily towards value then that's fine
but it doesn't make us wrong it just
means we might not be the review outlet
for you I certainly won't argue with you
if you declare the 99er okay as the best
desktop CPU because it's the fastest and
you don't care about anything else other
than performance that's fine but as I
said that's not how we evaluate products
and this is why I concluded my 99k
review by saying the core i7 8700 K is
still the best gaming CPU for almost a
50% increase in price you're looking at
maybe a 5% increase in performance a
you don't game at 4k I should also
mention that AMD has never once
approached us for pain reviews not AMD
or some sort of marketing agency acting
on their behalf so in all my years
that's never happened once directly or
indirectly they have done the occasional
promotion not with us we don't take
money from AMD or Intel but as an
example they have done ad deals with
tech sites and other youtubers for their
game bundles so obviously there's no
problem with them doing that same thing
with Intel if they wanted to run some
pre-roll ads to promote their products
or even sponsored bill videos in our
opinion that's fine
again we don't do either of those things
but I have zero issue with other media
taking up such offers it's really just
the paid product reviews that are the
issue so next time before accusing
someone of being a shill when you see a
benchmark result that you don't
necessarily like or an opinion that you
disagree with ask yourself is it really
paid for content I realize I'm only
speaking to a vocal minority here but as
I said earlier you're really making it
easier for those who do accept paid
reviews to get away with it if everyone
is a shill
no one is a shield I guess that's what
I'm trying to say anyway it's something
to think about
again we don't expect this information
to change too much but based on what our
patreon members said it seems like quite
a few of you will find this information
interesting and appreciate us talking
about it so openly so hopefully that is
the case and if you have any more
