been roughly three weeks since we
reviewed the core oh nine ninety nine
okay and in that time basically no one's
been how to buy it and locally here in
australia it doesn't look like we'll be
getting any more stock for at least
another week and how much more will be
getting in a week is anyone's guess but
i'm guessing it will be bugger-all
anyway despite the fact that you can't
really buy a core i nine nine are okay
we're seriously considering re-reviewing
it because we think it's probably worth
doing and we'll discuss why in this
video and then I'll actually turn it
over to you guys to vote on what you
think the best course of action is
today's video has been sponsored by as
rock and then you phantom gaming range
of Zed 390 motherboards the Zed 390
phantom gaming six and nine include a
blazing fast 2.5 gigabits per second
network interface offering gamers and
content creators two and a half times
the bandwidth compared to standard
Gigabit Ethernet for more information
please check the link in the video
description now since the 9-yard k
reviews first went live we saw a few
strange anomalies mostly relating to
power and thermal performance and the
results did stir up quite a bit of
chatter regarding whether or not the
night are okay in its stock trim really
ran it over 80 degrees with a high-end
cooler or is it more like 60 to 65
degrees to better answer that i guess
you have to first define what stock
actually means for the ninety nine
hundred k officially intel specifies the
core i nine ninety nine hurricane has a
TDP rating of 95 watts they Staton all
core base frequency of at least three
point six gigahertz and this is what the
TDP is measured from however they also
state that if just a single core is
active it will operate at up to five
gigahertz so the two frequencies
officially given are a three point six
gigahertz base and a maximum boost of
five gigahertz this means there's a 1.4
gigahertz disparity between the base and
turbo boost frequencies now it's
important to note that prior to the
release of the 8th gen core series intel
did actually specify the all core turbo
frequency for
example that made it quite clear that
the core i7 7700 K would target and
operate at four point four gigahertz
when all four cores were under heavy
load however with the release of the 8th
gen series which brought about the first
mainstream six core processor from Intel
they made the decision to no longer
disclose the all called turbo frequency
of course a predefined maximum all call
frequency still did exist and for the
8700 K it was 4.3 gigahertz Intel was
just no longer specifying this frequency
and therefore and no longer had to
guarantee that it would be achieved by
all hardware configurations for example
low-end motherboards the 8700 K was
right on the edge of the 95 watt TDP and
depending on the motherboard quality
this figure could be exceeded under
optimal conditions with optimized
voltages the 87 ROK pushes package TDP
to roughly 95 watts at the 4.3 gigahertz
all core frequency opposed to the 75
watts the 7700 K maxes out with its 4.4
gigahertz or core frequency so where is
the 7th gen core series part came in
well under the 95 watt TDP rating 3700 K
was right on the edge and again we saw
in lower quality boards that pumped more
voltage into the CPU in an effort to
maintain stability that the TDP was
often pushed well over the 95 watt
rating now for the new core I 999
hundred K the official default clock
multiplier table states that with all
eight cores active it will operate at
4.7 gigahertz and achieves this same
frequency with 7 and 6 cause active then
with five and four cores active it will
go up to four point eight gigahertz four
point nine you Hertz with three cores
and as I said earlier five gigahertz
with one and 2 cores active however as I
noted earlier Intel only states and all
core base frequency of three point six
key Hertz in a single core maximum at
Turbo Boost frequency of 5 gigahertz so
whatever happens between those variables
depends on the workload and crucially
how long the workload runs for but this
Intel specifies a time duration for
certain power limits commonly referred
to as pal 1 and PL 2 now we've covered
this on the channel before but in short
pail 2 is our boost consumption it
defines how much power the CPU can use
in bursts and
okay the limit is 119 watts Intel says
that the pale to state could be
sustained for up to 100 seconds but in
reality with a 1911 that it's just shy
of 30 seconds in a typical workload
called workload at least with the said
390 motherboards that we've used with
the 95 watt TDP enforced at which point
the power limit kicks in and that limits
the frequency down to whatever fits
within that 95 watt envelope and we've
typically seen during stuff like our
blender workloads that all eight cores
will clock down to four point three
gigahertz rather than the maximum four
point seven gigahertz that can be
achieved without any power limits in
place so the problem we have here is
that motherboard manufacturers for the
most part aren't abiding by either of
these power limits instead they're just
targeting the clock multiplier table as
they would have done with the seventh
sixth and so on and generations of core
processors yeah you could say that the
motherboard manufacturers are cheating
but we don't think that's it we still
feel it's Intel who are cheating their
own spec there's just simply no way the
board manufacturers did this on their
own and it'd be a mighty big coincidence
that they all decided to break the spec
in the same way and surely a seuss MSI
asrock an gigabyte have all worked
alongside Intel engineers to create
their Zed 390 motherboards anyway let's
not get into that just yet for now let's
look at how badly the TDP rating is
getting abused for sustained periods
here I've tested the 9900 K in our
blender workload without any TDP
limitations in place using a number of
core count configurations leaving
hyper-threading enabled I've tested the
99er okay in its stock trim with all
eight cores enabled and then seven more
times with a specified number of cores
enabled at the BIOS level I've also set
the frequency to meet that of Intel's
multiplier table with just a single core
enabled the ninety-nine hundred K
targets five gigahertz and here we see a
packaged TDP of just 35 watts well under
the 95 watt rating now please note all
this testing was done with the voltage
held at a steady one point one eight
eight volts
moving on with two cores enabled the
9900 targets five gigahertz and here the
package TDP is raised to 49 watts 49
watts with just two cores enabled with
three course the frequency drops to 4.9
gigahertz and this resulted in a package
TDP of 66 watts for course targets 4.8
gigahertz and here we're hitting 83
Watson already with just half the COS
enabled we're not that far off exceeding
the specified TDP rating interestingly
whereas the core i7 77 Eric a maxed out
at just 75 watts
the 900k with the same amount of cores
and threads enabled hits 83 watts that's
an 11 % TDP increase though we also do
have a 9% increase in clock speed and
the rest of that margin can likely be
attributed to any changes in voltage
along with a much larger l3 cache of the
99er okay of course we're not stopping
here the 1900 km a package TDP of 96
watts with five cores enabled at 4.8
gigahertz then with six cores we dropped
down to 4.7 gigahertz and here at the
TDP hits 114 watts then 130 watts with
seven cores and technically this
shouldn't be possible with Intel's PL 2
spec as the limit here is a hundred and
nineteen watts and then finally 153
watts with eight cores enabled at this
point we've exceeded the base TDP rating
by a little over 60% and the pl2 short
burst spec by almost 30% so what happens
to the clock speeds on a long run test
if we enforce the 95 watt TDP as
expected these single and dual-core
configurations still hit 5 gigahertz
because as we saw previously this is the
99er okay come in under the 95 watt
rating then with three cores active we
still hit the target of frequency as
this only saw a packaged TDP of 66 watts
however with 4 cores active we see a 50
megahertz return in frequency with the
95 watt limit in place this is then
extended to 250 megahertz with 5 cores
active 350 megahertz with 6 cores 500
megahertz with seven cores and then
finally 700 megahertz with all 8 cores
active this means we're seeing up to a
15 percent decrease in clock speed for
our blender workload and for less
optimally can
get motherboards running more voltage
this margin will likely increase I
should also note that I'm not using the
integrated GPU for any of this testing
now since first reviewing the kora 999
okay I've tested over a dozen well over
a dozen said 390 motherboards ranging
from the cheapest 120 dollar to $150 US
models right up to the much more
expensive flagship versions out of the
box all boards from MSI gigabyte and
asrock run with a dirty DP limit in
place even with the default bass
configuration however this isn't the
case for any of these suitable as I've
used the default out of the box are
cleared BIOS configuration employs a 95
watt TDP limit to remove it without
having to dig into the power settings
and do so manually you'll have to load
an extreme memory profile and then agree
to using the Isuzu optimized settings
rather than Intel settings basically a
seuss optimized means ignoring the TDP
limit and running at the default clock
multipliers like boards from msi
gigabyte and asrock do essentially then
Intel has two separate specifications
for their high and CPUs a TDP limited
specification that they loosely define
or a clock multiplier table
specification and enabling one means
it's impossible to achieve the other the
TDP limit means you won't reach the
intended all core clock speed while the
clock multiplier table spec means you're
running well above the TDP this seems to
have caused a divide between our viewers
on how we should test Intel processors
shall we make them abide by the
specified TDP rating just as AMD
processors do or should we test them
running at the maximum allowed clock
multipliers as they seem to do out of
the box on pretty much all motherboards
right now we're hearing a lot of back
and forth between my suppose AMD fans
AMD loyalists and then Intel fans Intel
those extremely loyal to Intel for
whatever reason it's not really good to
be in either of those camps but we seem
to have a lot of people that are anyway
the point that I'm trying to make here
is that
opinions differ obviously between these
two but we've also seen
last year that there's even the people
at each group seem to be unable to agree
on how we should be testing these
processes so for example with the 8th
gen release AMD's pitchfork crew were
shrieking at the top of their lungs how
we should test with a 95 watt TDP in
place the 95 watt limit well the well
let's call them the Blue Man Group
members they strongly disagree with that
they wanted to see the Intel processors
pretty much tested how they well how
they perform out of the box on the
motherboards that we were testing with
which I suppose is fair enough
even up was technically out of spec
depending on how you define the spec hey
now with the 9th gen series it's a bit
all over the place some AMD extremists
want us to actually test with the TDP
remove now I guess they want to see the
1900 can then on the other side we have
some Intel extremists that now say
motherboard manufacturers aren't abiding
by the Intel spec and are accusing them
of making the 99er ok and run much
hotter than it should and well that's
partly true I suppose but I'm again not
convinced that motherboard manufacturers
are really the ones at fault here
testing with the 95 watt TD spec also
introduces a few testing issues for
reviewers you can no longer just show a
single or even worse the best Cinebench
r15 run with an Intel CPU the same goes
for benchmarks such as VRA or really any
short rendering test like Cinebench or
v-ray or really any short test that uses
all 8 cores so ideally you'll need to
show short and long run results for all
applications as performance could vary
by as much as 20% anyway to try and
avoid hearing from the most passionate
brand loyal fans we've created a poll
and we want to know what you think is
showing 95 watt limited results
misleading even if it is included
alongside unlimited testing personally
Timur myself think the best course of
action is probably to revisit the 99er
ok review with both Unlimited and 95
watt limited results with both short and
long run testing
but as I said we're really keen to see
what you think and what you believe is
the most appropriate way to handle this
sort of thing in the future and
basically whatever you guys come up with
in this poll will really influence how
we test Intel CPU is moving forward I
guess that's kind of useful as well
since Intel themselves don't seem to be
able to create a concrete concise
specification for their own CPUs and
even if they could it appears they're
powerless to enforce it and I'm sure
that's the case so please click the link
below it'll be at the top of the video
description
that'll head you over to a public post
and our patreon page where you can vote
for your preferred option and yeah I'm
very interested to see where we end up
on this one anyway that is gonna do it
for this one
