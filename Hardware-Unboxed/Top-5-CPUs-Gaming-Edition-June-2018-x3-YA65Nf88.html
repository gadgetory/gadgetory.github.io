top 5 series video once again I will be
looking at CPUs in my previous top 5
CPUs video I picked what I felt was the
best budget CPU best value all around a
CPU best value productivity CPU best
performing gaming CPU and the best
extreme desktop CPU this time though we
are going to be focusing solely on
gaming performance so we're picking each
CPU based on almost nothing other than
it's gaming performance for the close
fought battles though we will take
things like platform cost into account
but for the most part it really will be
all about those glorious frames per
second so for this one the categories
will include the best sort of entry
level gaming CPU so a cheap pic there
then the best affordable CPUs that's
just spending a little bit more money
and then the best value CPUs that really
can be any price there it's just which
CPU offers the best value for whatever
reasons and then of course the best no
compromises gaming CPU as a bonus once
again we will be doing the best
secondhand deal so without wasting any
more time let's get into it
previously the pentium g 4560 claimed
the best budget gaming cpu category at
the time it really couldn't be touched
for well under $100 US this year though
saw the release of the risin 320 200 G
and with an MSRP of just $100 u.s. this
quad core processor offers way more
power for not a great deal more as a
bonus you also get entry level like
discrete GPU performance with the
integrated Vega 8 GPU other alternatives
in this price range include the horizon
3 1200 which is basically inferior to
the 2200 G in every way and then we have
the Intel Core i3 8100 the core i3
processor is very similar when it comes
to gaming performance and actually
depending on the game used it can be
faster that said it does also cost $20
us more on with years of life still
ahead for the am 4 platform we feel
budget gamers probably are better off
with the 2200 G as it is just a
considerably better investment or should
prove to be a considerably better
investment down the track
right so last year we did name the rise
in three 1200 which at the time was
selling for just a hundred and ten
dollars us as the best affordable quad
core gaming CPU since then though for
the most part I think it's safe to say
we have moved on from quad cores at
least at the sort of mid-range and
beyond so this time we're upping the
budget to $180 us to include these
significantly more capable core i5 8400
now before AMD fans smash their
keyboards across their free sync
monitors take a deep breath it's going
to be okay
I recently named the horizon 526 hundred
and twenty six hundred x as the best
value all-round a desktop CPUs around
$200 now if you're running core heavy
applications as well as gaming then I
feel personally that the horizon 5
Series is a better choice here you can
even overclock the horizon processes to
deliver superior performance in most
games however in order to really beat
the core i5 8400 expensive Samsung B die
memory and you then need to manually
tune that memory and you also need to
invest at least $20 u.s. and a better
cooler to support the overclock and this
is particularly true for the non ex
model the core i5 8400 on the other hand
smashes it out of the ballpark with the
absolute cheapest Intel 300 series
motherboard you can find and the most
bog-standard ddr4 2666 memory on the
market so it's a seriously
cost-effective hassle-free option and
it's well suited to gaming
okay so for those of you who find
themselves primarily GPU bound to in
gaming which I suspect is probably most
of you then something like the core i5
8400 or Aizen 5 2600 will do nicely
but if you're upping the GPU firepower
or perhaps playing titles such as csgo
overwatch or fortnight on super high
refresh rate monitors with competitive
settings then you will want every last
frame possible and to do so without
breaking the bank I feel like the core
i5 8600 is the best CPU here priced at
an MSRP of 257 dollars u.s. it's often
found selling for around $40 US and at
that price it really has no direct
competition particularly for those
looking at doing nothing other than
gaming at high frame rates overclocked
to 5 gigahertz 3600 K can easily extract
every last frame from a GTX TTI for
example or perhaps even two of them for
those few titles that still support SLI
if you've got a gtx 980ti
maybe two of them something even better
I don't know you got a lot of money you
spend on graphics cards it's basically
the point I'm trying to make here and
you want the best gaming CPU the market
has to offer then it really is the core
i7 8700 K Intel's low latency ring bus
architecture has proven to be the best
solution for gaming and then when you
couple that with a CPU that can
comfortably around all cause a 4.7
gigahertz with something like MC enabled
in the BIOS or can be manual overclocked
I would save to at least 5 gigahertz
then you've got yourself a real winner I
think it's been proven now that there
really is nothing that can touch the
8700 K right now the nearest competitor
when it comes to pure gaming performance
is probably Intel's own core i5 8600 ok
so this pick then really should be no
surprise we've had the same opinion
since the 8700 K was released and the
second general Rison series really
didn't change anything extremely good
value but if you want the best the best
it still is the 8700 K perhaps aim'd II
can take the gaming crowd away from
until next year and many believe that
they can but for now intel does still
hold that crown
last year I recommended second-hand
shoppers be on the lookout for a cheap
core i5 2500k processor and even today
if you can get one of those really cheap
with a motherboard memory than that is a
great deal because they can still play a
lot of games really well this time
though I am recommending something far
more recent in the risin 5 1600 I
currently they do retail for $190 us for
the most part brand-new but I've noticed
quite a lot of good second-hand deals
and you would assume it the CPUs are in
good condition there would be relatively
new they can't really be more than a
year old but of course how much you
would pay for these CPUs will differ
from region to region
slap that on an affordable be 350
motherboard I've seen a few decent
boards on the second-hand market
something as little as forty dollars us
so that's a serious bargain but if you
can't find one secondhand there are
still some really good boards that you
can buy brand-new for $70 us and doing
so means you'll have a cracking good
gaming system that you'll be able to
upgrade in a few years time with a Zen
plus of note as in - CPU we just had Zen
+ Zen to CPU if need be well there you
have it if you're a gamer looking for
the best gaming CPU for your next rig
then this should have you covered the
price range extended anywhere from $100
u.s. all the way up to 360 dollars and
there were a few good options in between
so if you liked this video feel free to
slap on a like we very much appreciate
that and feel free to let us know what
your top 5 gaming CPU list looks like or
just let me know whatever's on your mind
I'll browse the comment section down
below with caution thanks for watching
I'm your host Steve and I will see you
again next time
