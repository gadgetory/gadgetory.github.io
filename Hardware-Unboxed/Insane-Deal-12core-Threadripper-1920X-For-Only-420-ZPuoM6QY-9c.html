sure many of you are aware now AMD
released their second generation thread
ripper series earlier this month when
they unleashed the 32 quart 2990 WX and
the six core 2950 acts particularly
liked the 29 50 x very nice cpu that one
but anyway in two months they will be
releasing the 12 and 24 core versions
but before they do they've decided to
slash prices of the first gen parts and
the 1920 x in particular is a very
affordable now at least for a high-end
desktop part but before I get into it I
just want to share a quick message from
a new harbor unbox sponsor cable Maude
cable mod makes premium sleeve power
supply cables to spice up your PC build
and a sure that you have the perfect mix
of colors for our Aussie viewers there's
currently a huge cable mod sale
happening right now at PC case key where
you can get stuff like these harbour
unbox tile light blue mod mesh cables
for just 89 dollars down from 149
dollars there are plenty of other deals
to be had as well so check out the link
in the video description ok so back to
the non sponsored deal and I would just
like to make it very very clear that AMD
hasn't asked us or hinted in any way
that we should do this content and
definitely no money has exchanged hands
we do not take money from AMD very much
off the table that one I would have
covered this earlier but I just didn't
catch wind of it early enough pretty
much was really held up with that RTX
stuff so yeah forgive me anyway earlier
this month
AMD did quietly reduce the SE p which is
short for suggested eerie taylor price
and they reduced that down from the
launch price of $800 us right down to
$400 us so yeah I pretty shocked you can
buy this 12 call 24 thread CPU for just
$400 us and at those prices are now in
effect so that's yeah half the original
retail price just to be clear this is a
new official suggested price from AMD so
we should see retailers around the world
dropping prices over the next few days
if they haven't already
local retailer PC Kowski which has those
sexy looking cable mode slave cables on
sale right now dropped their price on
the 15th of august but with all the
craziness around the nvidia geforce 20
series announcement I'm only covering
the price drop now prior to July 21st
the 1920 X cost one thousand and sixty
dollars Aussie that price was dropped to
$960 Aussie on August 13th and then a
few days later to just $600 Aussie
that's an incredible deal for Australian
viewers
be aware though it's not really clear if
this sale will continue while stock
remains or if AMD will revert back to
previous pricing the information I have
right now suggests the sale will run
till the end of the month
so for at least a few more days yet that
said AMD might continue to offer
retailers rebate so they can maintain
the sale price at least until stock runs
out anyway $400 us for a 12 core 24
thread high and desktop processor isn't
incredible buy to help put this in a
perspective you can expect to pay
roughly the same amount for Intel's Core
i7 700 X which is a 6 core processor so
it has half as many cores on offer
meanwhile Intel's 10 core
7900 X still costs $1000 u.s. so at
least when compared to the Intel
high-end desktop offerings the 1920 X is
an insane bargain that said even at the
new low price were still paying a decent
premium over more mainstream parts such
as the 2700 X granted the 1920 X only
cost 20% more at the new price and packs
50% more cores but mother board prices
do inflate the platform cost quite
considerably
for example the 2700 X with a quality B
450 motherboards such as the MSI
tomahawk will set you back $430 u.s.
meanwhile the 1920 X with the cheapest
x3 no onboard available right now will
cost you $700 us so a little over 60%
more expensive factoring in memory
doesn't really help too much as you
still need a minimum of 4 sticks for the
x3 9 iron platform but that can also be
viewed as a bonus as well and I'll
discuss that towards the end of the
video once we've gone over
all the performance numbers speaking of
which let's jump runs the benchmarks to
work at who this affordable 12 core
processor is for all testing was
conducted on the msi meg x3 99 creation
using 32 gigabytes of stock g.skill flex
ddr4 3200 memory that said the
performance that you're about to see
will be achievable on any and all x3 and
I know motherboards and for the 1920 X
we recommend a budget board from either
MSI as rock or a soos ok let's jump into
the results as I said I'm just gonna
breeze through all the testing as you
can see for rendering tasks you're
looking at around a 40% performance
uplift at the 1920 X over the 27 Rx and
an incredible 90 percent boost over
Intel's similarly priced 7800 X moving
on this time we see when testing with
blender a 35% performance boost from the
2700 X and an 80% improvement from the
7800 X then the last rendering test were
going to look at is povery and here we
see a massive 46% performance boost for
the 1920 x over the 2,700 X and then a
decimate of the 700 X by an incredible
78% margin so for those of you that do
quite a bit of rendering it's pretty
clear that the 1920 X is an extreme
bargain still even for general use the
1920 X still gets at done and here it
delivered the best result in the PC mark
10 modern office benchmark being the 700
X by a 20% margin for budding content
creators the 1920 X is again a great
value option at the new $400 u.s. price
point for encoding work it was just 9%
fast in the 2,700 X but it was 43%
faster than the 70 an Rx even for heavy
editing tasks the 1920 X does well here
it was 19% fast in the 2,700 X and 27%
faster than these 7800 X then when it
comes to gaming the 1920 X is no slouch
either beating both the 2,700 X and 700
X in the core heavy ashes of the
singularity benchmark of course
performance might be as amazing in all
games but if this is a sign of future
gaming than the 1920 X should be a very
solid gamer for many years to come even
under less optimal conditions like what
we see here with Star Wars Battlefront 2
the 1920 X still does very well as it
pushes
well over 100 FPS at all times another
example is F on 2017 again not
earth-shattering performance when
compared to the competition but still
overall impressive stuff it has to be
said and 144 Hertz gamers will certainly
be satisfied
here's another CPU demanding title with
Assassin's Creed origins and we see the
1920 X does very well edging out the 700
X and 2,700 X by a slim margin another
big advantage of the extra 99 platform
and the quad-channel memory controller
of the 1920 X is of course big memory
bandwidth oh and of course big memory
capacity another strength is power
consumption with 1920 x you can get away
with a quality 650 watt power supply
let's say and still be able to pair it
with a high-end graphics card okay so
there's the quick performance refresh
out of the way now it's time to analyze
the deal kind of goes without saying but
I'll say it anyway if you can't fully
utilize a 12-course CPU and eight cores
or perhaps less maybe even six cores
will easily see you get by then this
deal really isn't for you just get a
2700 X or perhaps even a 2600 X
especially if you're just gaming however
if you need as many cores as you can
possibly afford and 700 ish US dollars
is about all you have received your
motherboard combo then you simply can't
do better than this deal I suppose on
average you could say that the 1920 X
and Koro 970 900 X are comparable if
your overclock the Intel CPU it might
win out by a small margin that is
assuming you have a constant supply of
dry ice anyway it is a pointless
comparison because the 7900 X plus a
basic motherboard the cheapest x-29
board you can find that combo comes to
about $1,250 us so that's almost 80%
more so assuming your workload can
utilize all 12 cores and you just see it
finished as soon as possible then what
the heck are you waiting for
I'd be snappy up a 1920 X for $400 US or
whatever it translates into your
currency with an affordable x3 nine
motherboard as soon as possible there's
no point waiting six to eight weeks for
the 29 20 X to land at $650 us that's
the
SRP and realistically it's only going to
be a few percent better in terms of
performance also worth noting while you
are paying two to three times more for
an x3 nine and I'm bored over annex 470
or B 450 board you do get considerably
more motherboard for your money remember
x3 ninety-nine bullet support huge
amounts of ddr4 memory with the ATM
slots
you also get a staggering amount of PCI
Express Lanes and loads of other
features like more USB 3 ports then you
can shake a stick at and that is going
to do it for this one again thank you to
