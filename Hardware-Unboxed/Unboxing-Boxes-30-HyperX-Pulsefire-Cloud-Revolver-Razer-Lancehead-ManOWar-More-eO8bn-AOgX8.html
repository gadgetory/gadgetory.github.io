episode of unboxing boxes as you
probably noticed a usual host Steve has
is not around at the moment he has
delegated this unboxing boxes episode
over to me and well it probably couldn't
have gone any worse to be honest day I
feel part of this episode earlier and I
took a look at some of the products that
you've seen in front of me today so I
took them out of their mailboxes and
everything that you've normally seen on
boxing boxes but I went to check the
footage a bit later and yeah something
went wrong with the camera and
unfortunately most of that footage was
unusable so I thought you know I'm going
to have to start again I'll do the
episode again we'll take a look at some
of these products unfortunately some of
them have already taken out of the box
and how to look at as you can probably
see in front of me and there's some
things over on the side that I want to
take a look at as well we're still going
to go some through some cool stuff
there's still some awesome products here
that I want to show you guys and well I
guess it's just on with the show so as
you've probably already noticed I'm
wearing a HyperX t-shirt and a number of
these products seeing in front of me are
from HyperX that's because HyperX sent
me a big box filled with goodies the
main thing that they sent over was their
new pulsefire FPS mouse which we've got
here and also out of the box just over
here so the one thing that HyperX has
done with the pulse fire mouse is that
they've completed their series of gaming
peripherals this is you know high perks
has been known for some of their memory
products and some of their headsets like
the cloud revolver in the past but they
really wanted to branch out into some
more serious gaming peripherals so they
launched the pulsefire FPS mouse as the
thing that would complete the series
we've also got on the other products
before we take a look to deep into the
pulse fire we've got a look at some of
their their other products that they've
got as part of their peripheral range
some of the things they've got here is
the alloy FPS keyboard this is their
only gaming keyboard that they've got in
the market at the moment
it is a mechanical gaming keyboard as
you can tell by the box on the front
uses Cherry MX blue key switches it's a
pretty basic keyboard as far as they go
this retails for I believe 99 US dollars
or around 130 Australian dollars if I'm
remembering correctly
it's pretty basic so there's no wrist
rest include include things like media
keys that are mapped to some of the
functions at the top there but the idea
of this keyboards it's bringing you a
basic mechanical keyboard experience
with the cherry MX blue inside and
that's all you'd really need for some
people who don't want features like
macro keys you don't necessarily need a
wrist rest who don't want RGB
backlighting functionality that's all
provided for a lot less money in the
alloy fps keyboard I'm not going to
unbox this because we've got a 50 things
to get through but that is one of the
interesting products from that HyperX
managed to send out for me today they
also sent over one of my favorite
products that they make the cloud
revolver headset so you might have seen
I reviewed the HyperX cloud revolver s a
couple of months ago that's the version
that comes with Dolby 7.1 surround sound
simulation support I thought the headset
was pretty comfortable and provided good
sound quality this is basically a
cheaper version of that headset retails
for 120 US dollars and the idea is this
head says that you don't get the 7.1
surround sound support but you still get
the same comfort and sound quality as
the revolver s this is obviously an
older product than the revolver s and to
be honest I've used the cloud revolvers
before and I think that they're
extremely comfortable in produce great
sound quality for they're around 120 US
dollar price and every 110 dollars but I
think for that price you get a quite a
good deal when it comes to a gaming
headset so yeah it currently complain
about the curve all if you're not going
to take all too much into that another
thing they sent over HyperX fury s this
is their gigantic mousepad the largest
version they're sent over to me which is
900 by 420 millimeters it's got a nice
feel to it just filling in the box yes
you obviously put this underneath your
after your big HyperX panel is you put
this underneath your alloy keyboard your
pulse fire mouse and I yeah get a nice
experience there so you can obviously
apply these as well but the main reason
why HyperX sent me over all this cool
gear clean this t-shirt is to show off
the pulse fire mouse this is their new
peripheral you'll find newer than some
of these other things I've just been
showing off and the main thing they're
trying to achieve with the pulse bio
mouse is this mouse costs just 50 US
dollars so it's a bit cheaper than some
of the premium RGB mice like the Corsair
glaze that I reviewed
a bit earlier on this channel um yeah so
50 US dollars 80 Australian dollars I
just reading some of the stuff on the
box it comes with a four preset dpi
things goes all the way from 400 to 300
3200 dpi
I typically gaming through you know the
2000 dpi range so that's perfectly fine
for me so it picks up three three ten
sensor insights got on run switches and
a lightweight 95 gram weight so
obviously when I splashed up the
recording in this video great earlier I
did take out the pulse fire mouse out of
the box I'm actually really impressed
with what they've sort of provided here
in terms of the game mousie I first
thought that it might have been a
symmetrical Mouse that could be used for
people in the left or right-handed but
it is slightly curved to people who want
to use this right-handed it feels really
nice in your hands it's nice and
lightweight I prefer more of a mice and
sort of the mouse or Ian sort of the 120
gram range so the 95 grams provided here
is a bit too light for me I still think
that things like the rubber grips on the
left and right side make it really easy
to hold this device you've got a nice
sort of soft finish on the top of the
mouse a single piece of plastic caters
that whole area there you've got the DPI
sensor in the middle there you've got
forward and back buttons on the left
hand side and a lightly not scroll wheel
it's a pretty decent entry as far as
gaming mice are concerned again for $50
the one thing I was really impressed
with probably the most is just the
ergonomics of the mouse I normally game
using a palm grip so when I'm holding
this mess of my hands it feels really
nice it glides across this pretty shitty
sort of surface here really nicely so
yes it's nice and smooth on the bottom
and everything yeah pretty happy with
what HyperX is provided for such a low
price 50 US dollars I think that's
perfectly fine price to pay for the
mouse and if you don't need features
like a 16,000 dpi sensor or RGB LED
lighting or modularity or anything like
that I think you pretty much Chicago
wrong with something like the pulse 5
here enjoying palm gripping art it's
really comfortable I'm really liking
what HyperX has done they're just
dealing with more reviews on the phone
got more stuff coming in the post for
you guys so yeah interesting stuff there
and always nice to get phone calls in
the middle of filming
anyway the next thing that I wanted to
take a look at as I was sort of getting
into is the razor Lance head so I was
primarily supposed to I least I was
expecting to see the lads head
tournament edition which is the wired
version of this mouse with lower latency
some newer of the products obviously you
know some people don't want to spend the
extra money on the whilst version or
they don't want to do with the latency
that the wireless version introduces but
obviously razor's decides to be the
wireless version instead so I'm going to
follow them up about that but we will
take a look at the lads head wireless
Edition because it's a pretty premium
Mouse as far as I understand it ass
customer nice fun packaging in here so
here is the landside itself it's got
sort of a metallized finish on the top
obviously know why because this is the
wireless version and inside the rest of
the box we sort of take out the rest of
the stuff well here's the dongle the 2.4
gigahertz proprietary connection dongle
sorry tiny cup I could barely see that
right there it also comes with this
little dock thing so you plug in the USB
dongle into the dock like so then you
get out this USB cables included here
you plug into there you can sort of
situate that nearest to the mouse for
the sort of lowest latency gaming
applications it's kind of nice to have a
wireless mouse sometimes time I
typically use just a wired mouse to my
you know day-to-day usage the PC gaming
stuff like that but you know if you need
to take the mouse around or you want to
use it you know the areas having the
wise functionality it's quite nice
welcome to the cult of razer as always
let's take a look at the mouse itself so
16,000 DPI sensor in this mouse with RGB
lighting you can sort of see some of the
wirings owns like on the scroll wheel
there in terms of its ergonomics now
yeah just using it now it's got this
weird sort of angle in on this sort of
right hand side here obviously they're
using these rubberized texture areas
that are quite nice but there's sort of
a bump here that for me as a palm grip
user it just for my for my pinkie and
ring fingers here it's not
not super comfortable on that edge I
think I need to use sort of more of a
looser grip or something like that
rather than with the HyperX pulsefire
sort of grips out and it sort of feels
really nice using my palm grip and it
just molds my hands really nicely but on
the on the on the lancehead yeah it's
just slightly more weird shape and not
as comfortable it's this area in here in
particular isn't as comfortable as I was
probably hoping for but we are getting
here you've got this sort of vents here
on the side here is probably RGB
lighting there as well a nice and clicky
scroll wheel here you've got some extra
buttons on the face of the mouse there
as well as your usual buttons there nice
quickie response it's quite light for a
sort of a wireless mouse you're not
having to add too much into the into the
product from being Wireless just turn on
have a look so you can see there's some
RGB zones on the edges here and here
we'll get some b-roll this I guess got
the Razer logo here as well that's RGB
and yeah like I said but not not as
comfortable as I've liked for the grip
that I personally use but I think if you
are doing more of the sort of core grip
like this you get a really good
experience out of lads head so I have to
chase them up about getting the wide
version of this which is actually what I
want to review but for now you know not
too bad as far as arrays of products go
we've also got another Razer product
right next to us as well
and this is something that if you want
to get checkout a review of these guys
which is the man or wore 7.1 Wired
edition so this is the newer of the two
ones they sell out they're the correct
product for this one I believe in
detention for about a month now you'll
see a review on tech spots this and not
necessarily on hardware and box bit busy
with a few other reviews but yeah so
let's talk about the the Man O'War 7.1
so I kindly put this back in the box so
we can do a nice little unboxing for you
guys on the show as you can sort of see
you know inside the inside the box here
you're more cult of razer stuff and this
is the headset itself so this is the the
start of the show and you can see it's a
very large headset
use massive ear cups on either side with
a lot of foam there there's not enough
foam in my opinion along the top edge
here so when you sort of wear it like
this I mean obviously these things are
massive and look like a bit ridiculous
with something so big but it's just not
as comfortable to say the cloud
revolvers that we've got over here I
find these are much more comfortable
headset to wear than the manor wars that
said there are some benefits in this
headset the sound quality is really good
this is a hundred and twenty US dollar
headset so are you getting very good
sound quality out of it I was pretty
impressed with it then you can tune it
all up in the Razer synapse utility as
well to how exactly you'd like your
headset to sound I was also really
impressed with this so this is the USB
dongle that provides the 7.1 surround
sound experience so normally the sense
that just connects to a PC using a 3.5
milkie RS connector so that's a standard
one with an inline microphone but if you
use the USB connector you will get a
virtual 7.1 surround sound so the main
issue I have with 7.1 surround side
headsets is that it normally takes just
a stereo feed you click a little button
on on the headsets audio cable or
something and the 7.1 surround sound
mode is enabled and then it tries to you
know take from the stereo sound and
expand it to you know virtual 7.1
surround so you can sometimes hear
what's behind you and around to the
sides or whatever but with the razer
device what they've done instead is that
they've mapped this to your computer as
a standard 7.1 audio device so what this
means is that in games that require they
can output 7.1 audio or 5.1 audio or
whatever that is great surround sound
and Descent positional audio that rose
has been able to achieve in their
utilities is pretty good in my opinion
but when you switch over to using a
stereo source you don't have to turn off
the surround sound in fact you can turn
off the surround sound mode so what you
get is that stereo audio is played just
like stereo audio left and right
channels it sounds great if you listen
to music or something like that and when
7.1 surround sound is implemented you
know 7.1 surround sound is just
automatically achieved whereas with a
headset like b kotov / s the surround
sound version of this
set you have to click a button to turn
off the surround so mode when you want
to listen to music because it tries to
expand the music to a 7.1 surround sound
environment and I think not really what
you want to listen to music but the with
the man-of-war it's all automatically
done I think that is a really good
feature of this headset one thing I have
been really no unfortunately for Razer
is that a lot of people be having some
build quality issues it isn't made from
the best quality plastic around the
edges or anything and there's a very
small plastic sort of segments of the
top and along there they can break and
I've heard some reviews from people who
have purchased this headset and it's
broken a few months into the UC I don't
think that's really acceptable for
headset so it's a bit disappointing to
see the build quality and comfort isn't
as good as I'd like but police Razer has
been delivering on sound quality with
the man Awards and of course this did
come originally from a wireless version
of this headset which is a bit more
expensive I think it's one hundred and
fifty dollars from memory for the
wireless version of the manor wars but
not too bad as far as headsets go I wish
it was a bit more sturdy but the sound
quality is very good also show you one
other product which is sitting under
these two that I've also been taking a
look at over the past couple of weeks so
this is what's something I really want
to cover a bit earlier than now but just
been too busy and again they'll be
review of this on text but if you're
interested but not on hardware box this
is the Logitech G 413 carbon so this is
pretty much the cheapest mechanical
gaming keyboard that you can get at the
moment at least from a name brand that
is this is an 80 US dollar product so on
90 US dollars I mean very cheap for 90
US dollars the hour over here as I
mentioned that's 100 US dollar keyboard
very similar feature set to this g4 13
carbon block CD carbon is a bit cheaper
the one thing it does provide obviously
you see on the back here where G key
switches not a huge fan of those but
we'll take a look inside the box because
again I've packaged this one up for you
guys
so
that we can take a look here is the G
413 carbon so one thing you'll notice is
similar to the our over there that there
is no wrist rest included with this
keyboard is our budget keyboard so
you're not going to get a whole ton of
features there's no dedicated media keys
either those are mapped to some of the F
keys over here there's no macro keys you
can use the F keys as macro keys but you
will have to remap those in logitech's
utility again there no wrist rest note
RGB backlighting either this does just
use red backlighting so some people you
know that's not going to be a problem at
all but if you want to get RGB a
backlight users have to spend a bit more
money there are some things I really
like about the design the metal backing
sort of brush our minyan that they use
along here looks really nice I think the
general design of the keyboard is pretty
good I did have a few build issues and
sort of finished issues with the key
caps along here a few sharp edges along
there that probably could have been
polished off but I think the general
texture to all these key caps feels
really good and the general economics of
using this keyboard even without the
wrist rest I think is pretty decent the
Roma GT switches though obviously are
would you take users roma juice which is
across their entire product line so one
of the benefits is that even though this
keyboard cost 90 US dollars you still
gain the same key switches as Logitech's
high-end keyboards that cost more you
know 150 US dollar or 250 Australian
dollar price points so the Roma G key
switches though I think they're pretty
mushy as far as keys go they don't have
too much of a clique to them I know
they're trying to give you that tactile
quickie response but I'm not feeling it
too much on the G 413 keyboard and in
general with the Roma juice which is by
online yeah it's definitely still an
upgrade from people who you know buying
rubber dome keyboards the el cheapo
gaming keyboards I want to upgrade to
something there's more premium and gives
you that mechanical feel this will
provide you a certain extensive
mechanical fuel obviously an entry level
experience in my opinion yeah but yeah
just a bit too much you can bend
something like the
the competitive chair makes balloons
yeah and the hyper in a hyper excited
that we've given much nicer tactile
response than the room of G's there are
some people out there who I think like
these sort of keys they're pretty quiet
as far as mechanical keys go that is an
advantage of some people that don't want
it to be too loud but for me who do I do
a lot of typing I use cherry MX Reds for
typing on it quite like that experience
for typing and gaming romo G's not quite
what I'm after personally but I think
that for $90 for a name-brand mechanical
keyboard yeah you can't go wrong it's
pretty nice keyboard for that amount of
money and for people who are just trying
to look at getting into the mechanical
keyboard markets definitely a decent
option a couple of other products I
wanted to talk about as well before we
finish things up on this episode of
unboxing boxes with Prague's that aren't
actually in boxes at all
it's the LG G 6 so you might have seen a
previous episode of unboxing boxes and
also my review of the galaxy s 8 that
that phone is pretty fragile and Steve's
Galaxy s8 book so obviously that's no
good and one thing I was really hoping
with the galaxy with the LG G 6 was that
this one would provide very similar
hardware and experience to the galaxy s
8 but without some of the fragility
concerns and it's certainly a less
fragile phone
there's no curved display in the front
there's much more metal around the edges
it's still glass on the backwards to a
reasonably solid device in that regard
and one thing I did notice is that
whoever used this device before it was
sent to me I did drop it a few times
there's some dings around the edges and
the stuff that sort of indicated was
dropped on something pretty hard but it
didn't break the screen is in perfect
condition the backs in perfect condition
as well
it's obviously it's a lot more sturdy
and stable than the galaxy si which will
slip out of your hands and shudder in an
instant so from that respect it's
certainly an improvement of the s8 there
are some issues I have with it firstly
it's using old generation Hardware
Snapdragon 820 1 SOC I can't quite sort
of match some of the top-tier SOC SoC
today like the Exynos 88-90 5 and the
Snapdragon 835 it's a fairway behind
those two processes so you're not
getting latest generation hardware the
g6
a bit disappointed two people who know
really want the highest quality hardware
in their phones you're not getting on
here the rear camera is pretty good like
don't get me wrong they're decent
quality they don't they're not quite as
good as the Galaxy s8 of the pics of
Excel but they just they remove some
features from the g5 that I finds desire
like they removed laser autofocus for
example they're removed optical image
stabilization from the wide-angle sensor
they also reduce the resolution of the
main camera I do like the combination of
both the wide angle and the standard
angle camera on the rear of this device
I'm using those wide-angle camera can be
pretty decent most feel like they
probably shouldn't have incurred too
much with what they produce last year
with the g5 and the camera if they were
going to keep a very similar camera
layout here one of the benefits
increased battery life the modular
system that was sort of a bit crap in
the g5 is completely gone with the LG G
6 so that means do better battery life
it is the sealed battery LG has been
known to have replaceable batteries on
pretty much all of their g-series phones
up until g6 so for people who want that
removable battery you're not getting it
with the g6 - the battery life is a lot
better
probably not talk to you like a pixel
Excel or something or the Galaxy s8 but
still reasonably good and the display
you know it still occupies most of the
front panel it's a two to one aspect
ratio 1440p class LCD it's a pretty
decent LCD in terms of that and and I
think the g6 is a it's a good device
it's good people are going to buy it's
only $550 so it's a bit cheaper than
some of the other top-tier phones
provide some decent hardware I just
don't think that it will compete as
strongly with the Galaxy S Avis and
other phones of this year I was probably
expecting it to be just a lil bit better
a little bit more competitive with
Samsung's current product so that's my
current opinion on the g6 you can
actually read my full review on techspot
calm right now but we're not going to
cover that on hardware box just due to
some time reasons let me just go get the
final products that I want to cover on
Hardware unboxed for this unboxing boxes
episode and your product disappeared so
this is the final product that I want to
cover on this episode of unboxing boxes
what we've got here actually was sent to
view sorted commodities this is just one
of them this is the let me just take a
look at the product number because
they're always
terrible xg2 seven zero three GS so
display manufacturers we need to find
out some new awesome way to name their
products because these part numbers are
so confusing these are very cool monitor
nonetheless from viewsonic and really
excited to be working with them on
hardware box purse and monitor reviews
in the next couple of weeks so what the
XG whatever it was provides this is a
27-inch 1440p gaming monitor and the
main feature of this is its 165 Hertz
refresh rate with g-sync so it's a top
tier gamma motor it cost seven hundred
US dollars from Newegg ad to double
check that is $700 $900 reduced in
Australia so it's a pretty expensive
monitor but really it provides pretty
much everything you'd want from a gaming
monitor that's not something that's all
Collider or something like that because
it's 1440p it's high refresh rate has
adaptive sync support it's a decent size
27 inch high resolution enough 1440p and
you know until we get some of those HDR
monitors by 4k 144 hertz or the ultra
wide you know 1440p class 200 Hertz and
others that we sort of Computex in more
i understand we should be seeing those
in the next couple of months this is
pretty much the sort of goals and tier
products in my opinion because a lot of
top-end GPUs like the GTX 1080 and 1080i
a really well suited to high refresh
1440p gaming and you know you can buy
some 144 Hertz or that sort of tier high
refresh 1440p monitors but 165 Hertz
takes it to the next level it's g-sync
you get that nice crispness that 1440p
provides over 1080p it's great to use as
a desktop monitor and we're taking a
look at housing on all the colors and
how the refresh rate performs in this
particular monitor I'm really excited to
look out for this because I think for
most people at the moment who are trying
to buy a high-end gaming monitor that
will last you for a couple of
generations if you don't want HDR the
next specs
option is something like a 1440p 165
Hertz monitor they're providing here so
we'll take a look more that are in an
episode a review of heartful and highway
in the coming weeks so busan did
actually send me another monitor which
is their latest moment sitting behind me
in a box i'm not going to bring up
because the box is you know huge but it
is essentially their version of a 24
point 5-inch 1080p 240 Hertz monitor
i've done a number of reviews of those
type of monitors on high run boxes over
the past couple of months we saw one
from a soos and aoc this is basically
viewsonic option it's a free sync
version of the modernist it's more than
a OC sort of class in terms of the 240
hertz 1080p monitors we started take a
look at that as well because and see you
know I've seen a number of those I'm
interested to see how few Sonics compete
so I believe I believe it's six hundred
US dollars but I'll have to have to
double check that for the review of
course but you see that on Hardware own
box in the coming weeks as well so I
guess that's pretty much all the stuff
that I wanted to cover on this second
attempt at doing a hardware and unboxing
boxes after so oh boy
so yes pretty disappointing to that
first go completely stuff up but I think
we got through some of the stuff that I
want to cover the primary thing of
course is the pulse by our mouse
surprisingly impressed with what I / XML
should do with their first attempt to
the game mouse is really solid I think
most people will be quite happy with
what it provides 250 US dollars so it
definitely go out and check that out
eighty US dollars for the pulse pulse
fire check out the reviews of some of
this stuff on text but we'll have some
content coming on hardware box as well
