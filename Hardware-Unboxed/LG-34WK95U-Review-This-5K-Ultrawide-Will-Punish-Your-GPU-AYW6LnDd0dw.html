we're checking out the LG 34 wk 95 you a
pretty impressive high-end ultra wide
display if you ask me this isn't your
typical 34 40 by 1440 affair
no the 34 wk 95 U is a 4k class ultra
wide packing a 50 120 by 2160 resolution
so essentially it's a 4k display with
some extra pixels added on each side to
stretch it out to 21:9 LG is positioning
this monitor primarily for content
creators boasting about its 98 percent
DCI p3 coverage nano IPS technology
Thunderbolt 3 support and display HDR
600 certification with such a high
resolution and immersive 21:9 aspect
ratio I think it could also temp gamers
that want to take their ultra wide setup
to the next level I've already mentioned
most of the key specs but there's a few
other interesting ones here firstly this
is not a curved ultra wide most 21:9
monitors these days have some form of
curve but the 34 wk 95u is flat which is
pretty unusual I think I prefer a slight
curve to these sorts of panels but I can
also appreciate the benefits to keeping
it flat especially for content creators
which appear to be who this monitor is
designed for before we get to that this
video is brought to you by as rock and
there's ed 390 Taichi ultimate
motherboard this flagship quality board
fully supports Intel's ninth gen eight
core processors thanks to a 10 phase vrm
design and you get a quantity at 10
gigabit per second Ethernet to learn
more check out the links in the
description below and while I said this
display might tempt gamers that's
probably only on the resolution and
aspect ratio front because we're not
getting many other gaming grade features
the monitor tops out at a 60 Hertz
refresh rate and does not support
adaptive sync but that may not stop
those who already game on 4k 60 Hertz
displays from jumping into the world of
5k Ultra woods
as is the case with many high-end
professional focused monitors the 34 wk
95 u does come at a high price tag of
$1,400 but there's no other monitors
available at this resolution so there's
no cheap option right now and there's a
quick note the 30
4bk 95 you is the same monitor as the 34
wk 95 you just in black rather than
white let's take a closer look at the
design and what I really like here is
just how simple it is there's no
distractions on the front it's just a
large panel with super bezels on all
four sides and a silver metal and
plastic stand the C shaped stand isn't
the most compact but it's also not crazy
for an ultra wide yet it remains very
sturdy
you also get height and tilt adjustment
LG sent out the white version for me to
review so the rear panel is simple white
plastic which looks pretty good like
many of LG's other monitors the ports
are found directly on the back panel for
easy access although it does make cable
management a bit more difficult than
other tucked away designs here we're
getting DisplayPort to HDMI ports a two
port USB hub a headphone jack and
Thunderbolt three given the bandwidth
requirements of ultra wide 2160p at 60
Hertz you can't run this monitor at its
native resolution and refresh rate over
HDMI 2.0 with no support for HDMI 2
point 1 this means you need to hook it
up using display port or the Handy
Thunderbolt 3 port many laptops now
include Thunderbolt 3 so the inclusion
of this port makes it easy to hook up a
laptop especially as HDMI is not really
an option if you are using DisplayPort
I'd recommend using the cable included
in the box this is the first monitor
I've had a few issues using with other
cables mostly because of the super high
bandwidth requirements so if you do
experience blanking it's probably not
the monitors fault but the cable the
on-screen display is controlled using a
directional toggle along the bottom edge
so that's good to see and seems to be a
universal inclusion across LG's monitor
lineup the features you'll find in the
menuhim mostly for adjusting color modes
and performance again this isn't
designed for gamers so there aren't any
gaming specific features here moving
into performance and there's a lot to
talk about here there are multiple color
modes calibration options HDR and mock
so let's work through everything
individually out of the box we're
getting a typical experience as this is
a wide gamut monitor by default that's
left unclamped so saturation and color
checker Delta averages are in the 3.0
sort of range which is okay but not
perfectly accurate there's definitely a
noticeable over saturation going on for
srgb content which is typical for an
unclamped wide gamut monitor grayscale
performance is decent though a cc
the average of 67 26k is pretty close to
accurate and a delta e average of 2.29
again isn't perfect but it's close
enough for default performance but I
don't think many people will be using
the screen in its default mode because
there are a number of factory calibrated
modes included ranging from srgb and
rec.709 to DCI p3 SMPTE dash C and EBU
I'm going to focus on the srgb and DCI
p3 modes in this review the srgb mode
was actually pretty disappointing and
that's down to a whacky CCT curve sRGB
uses a D 65 or roughly 6,500 K white
point but the 34 wk 95 u unit I received
had a white point of 5,600 K and an
average of around 6,000 K so it had a
warm tint overall this led to a poor
greyscale average of 4.75 and this arrow
trickles down through a saturation Delta
average of 3.1 one and a colorchecker
average of around 3.0 mark as well you
can't see the gamut is clamped so we're
not getting over saturation but the
white point is throwing everything off
disappointingly the same issue is
present in the similar rec.709 mode and
there is no way to adjust the white
point manually when you were using this
mode if the factory calibration is
perfect it makes sense to lock away the
color controls in a factory calibrated
mode like the srgb mode but if it's not
perfect it makes life difficult for
users as this is the case here I'd have
preferred if LG left the tools unlocked
as you can't clamp the gamut down to
srgb without using the srgb or similar
mode on the flip side the DCI p3 mode is
good greyscale performance is much
closer to the default mode with a
slightly incorrect CCT curve and a delta
a average of 2.45 but both our
saturation and color checker tests
reported in with a sub 2.0 Delta II
result indicating the mode was accurate
on average I also recorded over 95% DCI
p3 coverage which is right up there with
the best wide gamut displays while the
DCI p3 mode is good I still wouldn't
class it all the srgb mode as being up
to this standard of professional grade
factory calibration really you'd want to
see sub 2.0 Delta ease across the board
and that puts the 34 wk 95 you in a bit
of a weird position it's clearly
designed for professionals and the spec
sheet even lists that it has factory
calibration
LG makes no claims about specific
delta-e targets like you might see from
other program monitor z' in fact the
calibration sheet that comes in the box
says LG is targeting a sub v delta e
which isn't good enough for pro grade
accuracy and i suspect is why this
particular unit still managed to pass
it's not wildly inaccurate and in fact i
think it will be fine for more casual
users but it's not quite good enough for
professional creators that demand
out-of-the-box accuracy with that said
LG does give buyers the tools to achieve
true accuracy using external hardware
like a calibration device you don't get
such a device included in the box but
many professional creators that require
accuracy for their work should already
have them the main tool at hand is LG's
true color Pro application it's not the
best calibration software ever but it
works as advertised you plug in the
monitor hook up a color Rimet ur set the
targets you want and against to work
crucially it then uploads the calibrated
settings into the display so you don't
need to mess around with software
profiles it does also generate a
software profile but I found the results
to be excellent without it true color
Pro lets you calibrate to all five of
the gamuts the monitor has individual
modes for including DCI p3 and srgb the
settings are uploaded to one of the two
separate calibration profile slots so
for example you could generate an sRGB
profile for standard use and a DCI p3
profile for wide gamut work both of
which are stored in the display you can
then switch between these two accurate
profiles depending on your workload this
is definitely the best way to achieve
color accuracy with the 34 wk 95 u it's
a little disappointing that you need to
do this because the factory calibrated
modes aren't great but at least it
supports proper hardware calibration so
you're not exclusively relying on often
dodgy and incompatible software profiles
and while I always like to see perfect
factory calibration most creators that
need accuracy for their work should
already have the tools at their disposal
to get the most out of this monitor as
for the results you can achieve the true
color Pro I'm going to show you my srgb
profile here although you can expect
something similar for DCI p3 and the
other gamuts grayscale performance is a
lot better with a delta e average of
just one point one six and a good CCT
curve while saturation and color checker
delta-t averages are both below 1.0 so
that's a really strong result I can
achieve slightly better results with
soccerway profile generated in display
cal but considering this is a hardware
solution I don't see the point in
messing around this software alright
that's the color performance dealt with
let's take a look at uniformity being a
flat IPS panel there's a lot going for
it in this department and looking at the
results is pretty good especially for an
ultra wide there is a small dark zone in
the outer left corner but in the middle
zones we're seeing sub 2.0 Delta T's for
the most part and when combined with
excellent viewing angles I think this is
a suitable enough result for creative
work also important to mention is the
brightness and contrast when working in
the SDR mode brightness tops out at just
shy of 400 nits with a contrast ratio of
1080 to one so standard stuff for an IPS
display IPS glow levels worst and from
my unit as well you're not going to get
the contrast of a VA panel here but the
viewing angles and uniformity make IPS
more suitable for professional work
gamers will be happy to know that
response times a decent using the
default fast mode which is the mode I
recommend I achieved a 7 millisecond
greater greater than average response
which is standard for a pro grade IPS
and a little faster than most gaming
grade VA monitors but what's good here
is we aren't seeing super slow response
times occasionally with a Creator
oriented 60 Hertz high resolution
monitor we get slow response times but
this panel is fine and doesn't suffer in
that way input latency is also standard
at around 70 milliseconds well not as
fast as the best gaming monitors but
again fine for a creative monitor one
thing is for sure though if you plan on
getting this monitor for gaming make
sure you have a high-end graphics card
at a resolution of 50-120 by 2160 we're
looking at 33% more pixels than regular
4k so it's a step above 4k in terms of
its intensity and cheap hue requirements
take the nvidia geforce artex 2080 TI
for example which is the first single
GPU that delivers a truly excellent 4k
experience with this GPU and a lot of
tiles you can play it 4k with ultra
settings and get frame rates above 60fps
at 50 120 by 2160 you'll be lucky to hit
60fps in a lot of games even with this
sort of GPU intensive titles like Metro
Exodus I was getting mid 40s are best
with ultra settings in shadow of the
Tomb Raider on just the high preset I
was stuck around 50 FPS or lower and in
battlefield 5 multiplayer
I was just barely able to hit 60fps on
average now this is the 60 Hertz monitor
so there's not as strong of an incentive
to push above 60 fps but this resolution
really hammers the r-tx 2080 TI and
prevents it from consistently hitting
that magic 60 FPS mark games look
absolutely stunning on this monitor with
its high resolution and immersive aspect
ratio but if you're coming from a high
frame rate experience with a 20 80 TI at
other resolutions be prepared to drop
down a fair bit with this sort of
display the other big feature you get
with this monitor is HDR support thanks
to display HDR 600 certification the 34
wk 95 u is better than a lot of HDR
monitors which simply can't display HDR
content properly but it's also not at
the level of a true HDR display I tend
to class these monitors as semi HDR
they're better than an SDR display but
not quite at the required level when
looking at my HDMI monitor checklist LG
does manage to take at least some of the
boxes in every category peak brightness
exceeds 600 nits we're getting 95% DCI
p3 coverage which is more than enough
for HDR wider gamut requirements and
we're even getting local to me however
it's only edgelet local dimming with a
small number of zones so we're not quite
at the level required for a great HDR
experience this is because with edgelet
dimming and a low zone count tailoring
around bright objects is a big issue
especially when a bright object is in
the center of the display surrounded by
dark areas the edge leader in particular
can cause streaks to drag from any
bright objects right up to the edges of
the screen which depending on the
content is ugly and not what HDR is all
about the end result is that a giulia
dimming often can't deliver the high
contrast ratios required to display HDR
content as intended the 34 wk 95 u also
has a few other HDR issues that crop up
due to the backlight a measured peak
brightness as 614 it's with a
full-screen flash which is acceptable of
course but I couldn't achieve this level
of brightness in any other condition the
edge of the dimming erase struggles with
small bright objects dropping below 400
nits with a white window occupying 10%
of the display and falling down to just
300 nits with a 2% window typically I'd
expect a display to hit 600 nits with
not just a full-screen flash but also
with a small window size in fact
generally brightness should increase
with smaller bright areas not decrease
like with this monitor sustained
brightness tops out at 400 nits which is
fine for large bright areas but this
monitor is simply incapable of showing
bright highlights in small areas which
is one of the things that HDR is really
geared towards so while it is capable of
a twenty six thousand to 1 contrast
ratio between its full flash brightness
and lowest brightness level the contrast
within a scene in the best-case scenario
was more like nine thousand to one which
is below the recommended level for HDR
and that rapidly falls away in more
complex scenes as the edge of it dimming
array can't cope if you're after a
bare-bones HDR experience I think this
will suffice but I wouldn't buy this
monitor specifically for its HDR
capabilities and I wouldn't expect a
fantastic HDR experience it's definitely
better than many fake hgr monitors but
it's still not quite there yet
overall the LG 34 wk 95 you exist in an
interesting space given it to the only
50 120 by 2160 monitor you can get right
now so if you want this resolution this
is the option and it will cost you a
cool 1400 US dollars the first question
that comes to mind is whether this
resolution is actually worth it and I
think it is I think 50 120 by 2160 has a
lot of promise for productivity and
creative workflows where resolution is
important and in the future I think you
will also come into consideration for
gamers although right now it's very
punishing even on flagship GPUs if I
didn't also game on my editing rig I'd
seriously consider replacing my existing
34 40 by 1440 ultra wide with this lg
monitor because that extra resolution
would help out a lot with 4k video
editing then the next thing to consider
is whether this monitor is actually any
good and for the most part I think it is
it gets very close to the ideal
professional grade experience it
supports Hardware calibration which is
crucial for maintaining color accuracy
it's wide gamut with excellent DCI p3
coverage you're getting good uniformity
Thunderbolt through support and a nice
minimalist design the reason I say gets
very close is that LG's factory
calibration isn't quite up to scratch
especially with the srgb mode although
the ability to run your own Hardware
calibration does so
this problem if you have the tools at
your disposal regardless at this price
point it would have been nice to see
guaranteed sub 2.0 Delta accuracy out of
the box especially as its geared towards
people that want good colors the other
area of concern is its HDR performance
but to me this isn't as big of an issue
because it's
estia and white gamma performance is
fantastic and that will be good enough
for most creatives
on top of this I think adding in a full
array local dimming backlight to get
true HDR performance would increase the
cost even further that addition would be
better suited to a separate higher tier
product for HDR content creators while
the 34 wk 95 you can exist as a
standalone great option for non HDR work
and really there's what I think the 34
wk 95u is it's a great option for most
content creators and professionals it's
not going to be the best bang for buck
option and it's not very well suited to
gamers right now but if you want a
top-of-the-line ultra wide for your work
I love what this monitor brings and I'm
excited to see more products packing a
50 120 by 2160 resolution in the future
