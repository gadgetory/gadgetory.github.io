convenient way to how the data travel
with you has been via a USB thumb drive
pocket-sized storage has improved by
leaps and bounds over the past few years
it's now amazingly possible to get a 512
gigabyte thumb drive they were bitterly
mostly limited to around 128 to 256
gigabytes extremely compact some drives
though often suffer from a lack of
performance the Corsair Voyager GT 128
gigabyte model for example takes over 20
minutes to fill when copying large files
such as movies and twice as long when
copying smaller files such as pictures
there are faster options such as the
Voyager GTX but at a cost of 74 cents
per gigabyte they aren't cheap there is
however another option and while it
isn't quite as compact the performance
is considerably better not only that but
at the cost of 43 cents per gigabyte for
the model I have on hand it's also
significantly better values that model
mentioned being the brand new Samsung t3
portable one terabyte SSD at 430 dollars
it might not seem that cheap but
remember that this is a one terabyte SSD
with a claimed read and write speed of
450 megabytes per second
incredibly at that speed it takes less
than five minutes to write 128 gigabytes
worth data of course you don't have to
buy the one terabyte model for less than
a high-performance 128 gigabyte thumb
drive the 250 gigabyte III can be had
for 130 dollars there's also a 500
gigabyte model for 220 dollars the t3
will be replacing last is t1 model and
it brings about a few improvements such
as a USB 3.1 type-c connector and an
aluminium case which should be much more
durable than the old plastic design of
the t1 the t3 might be physically larger
than a traditional USB thumb drive but
it's really no heavier just 51 grams for
the one terabyte model the t3 will
easily fit in your pocket along with the
USB cable if need be inside lies a
Samsung SSD 850 Evo mSATA SSD so you
know the t3 isn't gonna be sluggish when
it comes to file transfer performance as
I
Genelia Samsung is promising a 450
megabytes per second sequential read and
write speed for the t3 series so let's
jump into the benchmarks to find out how
that translates into real-world
performance first up let's copy a single
large 5.8 gigabyte compress file from a
local SSD to the Samsung t3 as you can
see the t3 for the most part sustained
over 400 megabytes per second to
complete the task in roughly 12 seconds
for an average transfer speed of 489
megabytes per second this is obviously a
seriously impressive throughput for a
pocket-sized storage device next we
threw a heap of small compressed and
uncompressed files at the t3 7350 files
in fact totally 5.45 gigabytes this
upload test took roughly 27 seconds for
an average transfer speed of 202
megabytes per second in comparison the
Corsair Voyager gtx is only good for
around 60 megabytes per second in the
same test the samsung portable SSD t3 is
a serious bit of kit and for those
requiring a large capacity high-speed
storage device that goes unnoticed in
the pocket its product as a must when
compared to the previous t1 model the t3
features better build quality higher
capacities and more convenient USB
type-c the t3 really is better in every
way with the exception of the price
which sees the one terabyte model price
considerably higher over 20% higher in
fact at four hundred and thirty dollars
compared to the $350 to the t1 this is a
massive pricing discrepancy and I don't
think the typeset connector and the
aluminium chassis is worth paying that
much more for hopefully the pricing
become more competitive in the coming
weeks other than that the t3 is an
awesome product the two terabyte model
is certainly drool-worthy though the
$850 asking price is little less
enticing so it's the t3 portable drive
you'll be considering let me know in the
comments or on our forum a hard brown
box com I'm your host Matt and as always
I'll see you next time yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
