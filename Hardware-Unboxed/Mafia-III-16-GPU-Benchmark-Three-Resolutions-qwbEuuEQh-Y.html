seriously looking like a solid contender
for this year's worst PC port the game
was plagued by a number of issues the
most extreme of which for PC gamers was
the 30fps cap the reasons surely none of
us could understand develop a hangar 13
and publish the 2k games thought it
would be OK to deliver us a game cap to
console level performance the moment it
became apparent to gamers that they were
stuck at 30 FPS they began posting steam
reviews and droves leaving less than
flattering comments about the game
having seen this I can my performance
breakdown in the game moved on to other
projects thankfully it wasn't long
though before 2k games now stew patch to
fix the various issues and the patch
arrived within a few days this update
enabled gamers to use one of three frame
add options being 30 60 and unlimited
FPS gamers can quickly change the frame
rate cap by a heading to the display
menu and looking for the options in the
frame rate settings once the patch is
installed so now that it is possible to
render an excessive 30 FPS on PC what
kind of hardware are you looking at for
a highly playable lag free experience
with a game maxed out of 1080p 1440p and
4k we plan to find out using the latest
and previous generation AMD and NVIDIA
GPUs the testing of simple 60-second
fraps pass has been recorded we start at
the mission titled a taste of the action
here the player is preloaded into a car
which they're meant to drive to Sammy's
bar instead we go on a 60-second Drive
in the wrong direction for this test and
the path you take is easy to accurately
replicate over and over again as we did
here's a quick look at the rest of that
pass now
first up let's check out how last
season's GPUs handle this new title
starting at 1080p things look a little
grim
the value-oriented gtx 960 and r9 380
only just broke the 30fps barrier
meanwhile the gtx 970 and 99 390 were
only good for a little over 40 FPS
meanwhile the mighty fury ax 980 TI
struggled to reduce the desired 60 FPS
moving to 1440p not a single previous
generation GPU could reach 60 FPS in our
test the 980 TI and fury ax both saw a
minimum of 41 FPS while the average of
the GeForce GPU was slightly higher at
48 fps as for the rest of the field it
took the GTX 970 to only just crack the
30 FPS barrier give him what was seen a
1440p we didn't really need to test 4k
but I knew you guys would want to see
the data anyway so here it is ya know I
should say here really so let's move on
even with the current generation
mainstream cards mafia 3 isn't exactly
highly playable at 1080p as frame rates
of well below 60fps the RX 480 and gtx
1066 gigabyte delivered virtually the
same performance with 45 FPS each the 3
gigabyte 1060 wasn't much slower
averaging 43 FPS meanwhile invidious big
guns all pushed over 60fps now at 1440p
we find that unless you enjoy console
like performance gamers will require at
least two gtx 1070 even then for a much
more desirable 60fps be prepared to
shell out for a gtx 1080
even the insane tight neck speed can
achieve 60fps at 4k as minimums dropped
down to 30fps this clearly isn't a fork
a friendly title at this point in time
throwing everything together we see some
pretty competitive performance at 1080p
between AMD and videos current and
previous generation GPUs
the mixed 1440p results really highlight
just how much faster the GTX 1080 and
Titan XP GPUs are than everything else
we have right now aim DS Vega line up
can't get in soon enough and again here
are the 4 K results not much to say here
the Titan XP is really the only GPU
you'd consider using to play this game
at 4k something I noticed when
benchmarking all those graphics cards
was how high the CPU
was on my core i7 six to seven hundred K
4.5 gigahertz test machine Li typically
we only see utilization hovering around
the 40 to 50 percent mark for most games
so it seen constantly P and about 60%
and even going over 70% was surprising
this is the result of the game not just
loading up all four cores but also
taking advantage of hyper threading with
load spread across all eight threads for
a game this is a very rare site and it
could spell disaster for anyone running
anything less than a quad-core processor
before wrapping things up I took a quick
look at CPU performance with the 6700 K
when clocked at 4.5 gigahertz we still
saw a temps and drop an average
framerate which was surprising
keeping in mind we're testing at 1080p
with a Titan XP so an extreme case
scenario but still surprising results
nonetheless what was interesting were
the results found when testing the CPU
locked at 3.5 gigahertz with
hyper-threading enabled the performance
was the same as what we found at 4.5
gears however with hyper-threading
disabled performance took a huge dive
the minimum frame rate was reduced by
30% mafia 3 is a great looking game but
doesn't justify the huge demand just
seen not only on the GPU but also the
CPU I tend to think knows the answer
here this is likely a case of yet
another rough console port I'm sure many
of you like me lost all faith in the
developer when they decided to port the
game to PC with a 30fps cap how does
that even happen for 1080p games are
ideally gonna want at least two GeForce
GTX 1060 or rainy and are X 480 from
this current generation while last gens
GTX 970 or I know 390 will suffice if
only just
1440p was a seriously tall order and
unless you have a previous generation
flagship graphics card or one of them
videos big Pascal GPUs forget about the
high quality settings as the 4k unless
you have one of the most extreme systems
getting around be prepared to scale that
resolution down multi GPU support
doesn't exist either
so GPU teamwork isn't gonna help out
here either both AMD and NVIDIA have
provided game ready drivers from our p3
though I notice no difference in
performance between the latest optimized
driver and the previous version I did
notice the performance throughout the
game does vary quite a bit depending on
where you're located and the time of day
driving seems to be the most taxed
thing you can do for performance and the
more densely populated the area the
worse the performance is going to be I'd
say my results are fairly typical but
there are parts of the game where frame
rates will dip even lower so be aware of
that tube another huge performance
variable is the CPU the demand of the
processor is pretty extreme quite a few
core i5 owners have been complaining
about stuttering performance due to 100%
load across all four cores
this is further evidence of a poly
Porter game it's hard to believe that
you need a core i7 processor to avoid
stuttery gameplay especially for this
type of title so hopefully the game will
receive further patches to address these
performance issues what do you guys
think
keV you guys tried mafia 3 let me know
in the comments
I'm your host Matt as always and I'll
see you guys next time cheers guys for
joining me for another episode of
hardware unboxed so those of you that
already support the channel thank you so
much it's truly appreciated and to those
of you that would like to support the
channel directly I do have Amazon links
and a patreon link in the video
description below thanks a lot and I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
