horas has never skipped on hardware for
their top-of-the-line laptops the
brand-new horas x5 b7 is no exception it
brings an overclockable Intel cable like
CPU powerful nvidia geforce gtx 1070
graphics and even a high-resolution
display to a sleek and compact chassis
well it doesn't qualify as an nvidia
max-q laptop the exercise that pushes
that just above max q spec has ensured
an uncompromised gaming experience for
hardware we're looking at a quad-core
intel core i7 7820 HK processor and yes
this is a case series processor
indicating the CPU can be overclocked
GTX 1070 graphics with 8 gigabytes of
gddr5 is paired with a high resolution
g-sync display is a 28 80 by 1620 or in
the case of motive unit here for K 16
gigabytes of ram is standard but again
always kick that up for their review
'not here 32 gigabytes you find site
there's also an end up to SSD and a hard
drive I mentioned the exercise v7 isn't
a max-q laptop but that doesn't mean
it's outrageously large in fact as far
as gtx 1070 laptops go this species on
the smaller side with the thickness of
22.9 millimeters and a weight of 2 point
5 kilograms it's a 15.6 inch unit 2 so
the overall footprint end of massive
which makes it easy to carry around
although keep in mind you'll need to
carry around the 600 gram power brick if
you want to make full use of the
basically hardware inside this laptop
the extra is cooling solution comprises
of a lot of vents to provide enough air
flow to the i7 7820 HK and gjx 1070
inside but perhaps not as many events as
appear at first glance fans at the top
left and right corners drawing air
through vents on the top and base of the
laptop which is then exhausted through
the back end sides the vent that
surrounds the illuminated or slow go
power button as well as the side vents
at the front of the laptop and used for
the multi speaker setup magnesium
chassis looks pretty nice and I love the
lid in particular with its illuminated
or logo the x5 v 7 is equipped with a
fantastic array of ports the left has
HDMI 2.0 2 USB 3.0 and
card reader the right mini displayport
1.32 3.5 mm audio jacks Thunderbolt 3
there's USB 3.1 type C port there and
the back well you see a power port
Ethernet and two more USB 3.0 ports as a
minor complaint it's hard to tell the
difference between the Thunderbolt 3 and
USB 3.1 type-c ports without looking at
the tiny logos printed next to them
they're both USB type-c so they pretty
much look identical the keyboard used on
the x5 v 7 is gigabytes new laptop
design I first saw on the arrow 15 its
travel distance is good for a gaming
laptop with a nice cookie response to
the rubber dome keycaps
the amount of force required to activate
each key makes it a great option for
both typing and gaming and allow is
respectable as well especially the large
sizes for the left modifier keys and the
inclusion of both a numpad and macro
keys is a welcome inclusion all this
includes full RGB backlighting here with
the ability to individually customize
the color of every key you can achieve
awesome effects through diffusion
utility and you can also create profiles
for each game that illuminate just the
keys acquired to be game utility and
customized ability isn't as well
featured as razors competing offering
though it's nice to see another laptop
with full RGB keyboard lighting the
trackpad well it's a garbage elearn unit
so I'm not going to spend too much time
on it because especially at high
resolutions it's tracking performance is
pretty poor you need to use a mouse with
this laptop on the other hand the
display is one of the best aspects to
the x5 v 7 most gaming laptops up to use
boring 1080p displays which often don't
get the most out of the hardware inside
them decks 5 v 7 comes in to display
options and neither are 1080p you get a
wqhd + display or a UHD display both
with g-sync and both with IPS technology
my review that was the UHD 4k model so
it's no surprise to discover that it has
just a maximum refresh rate of 60 Hertz
but do you think he is still hugely
important for a smooth gaming experience
like the gigabyte aro 15 the OS X 5 v 7
is x-rite Pantone certified which means
the laptop comes with an sRGB accurate
display profile that can be toggled in
the command and control utility most
gaming laptops are poor in terms of
their display accuracy but thanks to the
x-rite Pantone
d x5 b7 is actually quite decent in this
regard not as good as the area of 15 but
below a delta value of 2.0 across our
color tests and with an average color
temperature that's near accurate color
calibration comes at the expense of
brightness the x5 b7 is only capable of
265 minutes of brightness and the IPS
contrast ratio of 1041 to 1 is only okay
but for those who require a fully
calibrated display I was able to achieve
fantastic results with spectra tile
Kanban by pushing a delta e average of
below 0.7 across the board that's dead
accurate as far as I'm concerned the us
X 5 b7 includes slightly different
hardware than we usually see in gaming
laptops most gaming machines opt with
Intel's Core i7 7700 HQ that's a locked
quad core eight thread processor with a
base code for 2.8 Q Hertz Bruce up to
three point eight gigahertz the x5 b7
though uses a higher-end cable a quad
core the core i7 7820 HK which by
default is quite a 2.90 goats and boost
up to 3.9 gigahertz now normally you
know a hundred megahertz clock speed
increase not easy to get excited about
but the i7 7820 HK is AK a serious
processor so it can be overclocked and
out of the box the OSX 5v7 makes use of
this capability pushing the clock speed
up to 4.2 gigahertz for single core
workloads and 3.8 gigahertz for all core
work words sometimes I observe this all
core clock speeds dip to 3.6 gigahertz
students sustained usage that's still
you know a hundreds of 300 megahertz
overclock which is nothing to sneeze at
in laptop form factor the GPU well
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 with a gigabytes
of gddr5 has always been the case the
laptop gtx 1070 slightly different to
the desktop part with more cuda cores
and a lower peak rate of clock speed the
performance though of both chips is
pretty much the same my review 'not was
killed out with 32 gig of g.skill
ripjaws ddr4 2400 although i believe 16
gig is the norm for this laptop inside
our to end up two slots although only
one is occupied in this case with a
Toshiba thn sn5 256gb SSD not a mouthful
at all but that is a 256 gig nvm I PCIe
SSD
it and you can store more than just
three games in it because there's also a
one terabyte 7200 rpm hard drive from HD
SD as you'd expect system performance is
a bit higher than what I've seen in the
past and gaming laptops to pack that
7700 HQ the clock speed differences of
up to 400 megahertz do lead to better
performance in some situations
particularly rendering workloads like
Cinebench and the x264 benchmark here's
the CPU can be up to 20 percent faster
which is a decent margin that does help
when it comes to games storage
performance is also decent there nothing
hugely outstanding as most gaming
laptops these days include fast and
blocked two drives with sequential
performance above 1 gigabyte per second
a larger drive would be nice though as I
mentioned before there's a spare and up
to 14 sites upgradability there's two
questions to answer when it comes to the
graphics performance of the x5 b7 we
know the gtx 1070 is a highly capable
GPU at 1080p but is the extra CPU power
of the i7 7820 HK if we perform it
significantly compared to more typical
i7 7700 HQ laptops and secondly it's the
gtx 1070 with this cpu good enough for
mobile gaming at 4k after all there's a
4k display in this laptop so if the GPU
is capable I'm sure you'll want to use
that functionality let's answer the
first question to begin with across a
range of more recent games the extra CPU
power no doubt has a significant impact
on gaming performance looking at GTA 5
we can see an uplift in both average and
minimum frame rate over the Asuza rog
gol 502 vs which is the gtx 1070 laptop
equipped with a weaker i7 70 782 cpu
with the 1% load now pushing above 60fps
it's an ideal experience with four times
MSA a rise of the Tomb Raider goes from
unplayable to playable a maximum saying
thanks to the faster CPU which pushes
minimum frame rates above 30 fps
now you probably wouldn't want to play
at those settings when turning off
assets AAA plastically improves
performance but it's good to note in any
case Deus Ex mankind divided isn't
massively impacted by the faster CPU the
performance is marginally better in both
average and middle
frame rates it's a pretty GPU limited
game so there's no surprise here here
man gets a big bump in average framer
and a booster minimums now pushing about
60fps 99% of the time it man is pretty
CPU intensive so it's no surprise to see
the faster 7820 HK delivering a good
speed bump in this game civilization 6
is another CPU limit again the benefits
significantly from the CPU speed bump in
the Auris x5 p7 the game is a very
playable on i7 7200 HQ considering the
built-in benchmark is a bit of a stress
test but more frames on average and at
minimum it's always nice and thanks for
the faster CPU here watchdogs - again
more performers from the Auris X 5 b7 in
what is a demanding game on the CPU it's
nice to see the GTX 970 being capable of
1080p ultra detailed settings and
there's extra few frames certainly
helped the last game we'll be looking at
here is Mass Effect Andromeda inside the
surprisingly demanding tempest I don't
have any comparison data from the GL 502
vs but it's nice to see much better
performance the GTX 970 laptops in any
case we have navale employments expect
much better performance than these
numbers show so as far as gaming at 4k
is concerned the GTX 1070 isn't powerful
enough for me to comfortably say 4k
gaming is possible in every game there's
certainly some times where the OS X 5v7
can push decent frame rates at 4k but
the most intensive games in my test
suite were simply too much for the GPU
at decent quality levels as you can see
from the table only hitman and
civilization of 6 were playable at 4k
Ultra quality with minimum frame rates
above 30fps
u.s. x5 v 7 as a decent display so the
experience with these sort of
performance levels in a decent although
I suspect some people probably want a
little bit better than unless in other
tiles you need to play around with
reduced quality saved hit playable
performance at 4k the good news is that
for the most part you don't need to
reduce quality levels too far to hit a
minimum frame rate above 30fps some
games were very playable on high details
at 4k
what others required degree down to
medium details instead but the great
thing about having a 4k display on a
laptop like this if you can choose
between high resolution gaming and high
performance gaming depending on the game
and your
if you prefer ultra quality and 60fps
you can plant 1080p with that much
hassle but if we want a native 4k exclus
or you're playing at a game where you
know the gtx density is no trouble at 4k
you'll have the ability to push up the
resolution for much sharper gameplay the
main downside to the OS X yv7
performance are the noise levels from
the cooling solution this laptops isn't
quiet especially in the Lord and has a
tendency to run expands at an audible
level even when the workout is like
headphones are a must for gaming
temperatures are reasonable though not
fantastic after 30 minutes of gambia
watchdogs to the CPU was sitting in a
toasty 88 degrees Celsius from
approximately 70% usage while the GPU
set at 85 degrees there is some thermal
Headroom as far as the fans are
concerned because they can spend up a
bit higher than they were under this
test though as clear OS has designed the
laptop for the factory overclock they've
gone with it's also worth mentioning
that some moves of the laptop chassis
can get pretty hot the W a s and D keys
get a bit harder than I usually like and
the upper parts of the magnesium body
probably shouldn't be touched during
like the usage but if you want a premium
gaming experience there's no doubt in my
mind that you'll get it with the Auris
x5 b7 the collection of top-end Hardware
particularly the overclockable i7 7820
HK and high-resolution g-sync display
delivers a notably bennet gaming
experience of a more basic gtx 1070
laptops with the core i7 7700 HQ inside
to get the OS x 5v sevens premium GTX
970 gaming experience you need to pay a
hefty premium though gtx 1070 laptops
tend to start around the 1500 to 1700
u.s. dollar mark by the entry-level x5 v
7 costs a whopping $2,400 of course
you're getting much better Hardware in
every regard though some will find it
hard to you know swallow as $900 margin
we're not quite hitting GTX 280 laptop
pricing but this laptop does come pretty
close anyway that's it for this look at
the x5 v 7 if you're interested in this
laptop you can check us current prices
in the description below also definitely
head over to tech spot and take a look
at the written review because I covered
a few things in there that I didn't
discuss in this video for time reasons
clocking the CPU and GPU is one of those
things anyway that's it for now and I'll
catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
