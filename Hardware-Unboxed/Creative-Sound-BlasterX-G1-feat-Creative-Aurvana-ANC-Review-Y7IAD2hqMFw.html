I'm box
I'm your host Matt and today I'm gonna
be taking a look in new implementations
of 2 knots and new technologies by
creative back when I looked at Cortez
Boyd's round head said I thought it was
pretty nifty the little USB soundcard
can be used with any stereo headset to
create a virtual 7.1 experience and
thought that would be pretty handy for
anyone with a stereo headset they
already really liked but simply wanted
to add virtual surround sound - well
creative for obviously listening and if
since produced the sound blaster xg1 a
small and extremely portable 7.1 gaming
sound card hitting two birds with one
stone I'm also gonna be checking out the
new ivana anc active noise canceling
headphones from creative which are
primarily designed for commuters to tune
out all that annoying background noise
I'm planning to be doing a lot more
travelling soon so they should come in
really handy ultimately I'm gonna see
how these two products from completely
different product ranges pair together
to test just how dynamic the g1 really
is first let's take a look at the g1
itself there's not a lot to it it's a
small thumb drive looking USB device
that's shaped like a tiny version of
Sound Blaster X's g5 with an illuminated
SPH logo and all at the front end is a
braided cable that's a couple of inches
long and ends in a USB male connector
for plugging directly into your PC
laptop or console at the back side
there's a simple gold-plated
three-and-a-half millimeter jack for
connecting your headphones the g1
supports headphones anywhere between 16
and 300 ohms and would deliver high
resolution 24-bit 96k kilohertz 7.1
positional audio perhaps with the g1 is
most powerful is in its ability to
enable you to control your sound through
creative blaster ex acoustic engine
software I've covered this software in
detail before but the highlights include
the ability to use creatives pre-made
custom profiles for different sound
situations powerfully create your own
profiles using creatives proprietary
sound processing effects enable Scout
mode to highlight enemy sounds and
first-person shooters change your voice
with voice FX and a few other advanced
settings now let's take a look at the or
vana ANC's these headphones a very
purpose-built for commuters and I really
like that they come in a hard carry case
that's excellent in its own right
unzipping the lid you'll find a little
zip compartment that contains your cable
and plane adapter and could also
be used to store other small attachments
this can be moved around and cleverly
velcro backed on the right hand side is
a removable and velvet-covered insert
designed to keep the headphones in place
it is a nice touch and here you'll also
find the headphones themselves the first
thing I noticed was just how light they
are which is really important in terms
of comfort of course they feature a
simple and thin extendable headband
that's wrapped in memory foam and a soft
leather hat
this extends down to the ear cups which
are on the small side though they are
considered over ears the ear cups are
also padded with a soft foam and
leatherette and they're definitely
comfortable enough although I personally
would have preferred they were a little
larger the inside of the ear cuffs is
labeled iron owls you know which is
which and they swivel 90 degrees to be
able to sit flat around your neck on
your desk or in the carry case on the
right ear cup you'll find the battery
compartment which takes a single
triple-a battery and thankfully with the
ANC's batteries are included on the thin
braided one-and-a-half meter cable
you'll find an inline remote in my but
strangely volume can't be controlled
here whether this is a limitation of
being active noise-cancelling headphones
I'm not sure but if it isn't then it
seems like a strange oversight instead
we're left with a single button that's
used to play or pause skip tracks when
double or triple pressed as well as
answer and hang out phone calls this
sound from the ANC's was pretty good
they aren't super loud though they are
loud enough and paired with the active
noise cancellation they're able to make
my recent flight to Sydney quite a lot
more comfortable the active noise
cancellation works really well for
constant droning sounds like you find on
an airplane and this is where they're
absolutely perfect in fact I'm
disappointed I didn't get on to active
noise cancellation sooner instead of the
deep loud drone you only hear a faint a
higher pitch sound that's easily
forgotten and drowned out by your music
the actual sound from the headphones was
good too and they're suitable for a
broad range of sounds the low ends are
there and they aren't overpowering at
all but the strong winds and clear hires
are the best aspects of the ANC's sound
now time to use these devices together
clearly vo ivana answers are not
designed for gaming and in their analog
format they're obviously limited to
stereo sound I connected them through
the g1 and I wasn't really sure what to
expect as I mentioned earlier being able
to use the acoustic engine software as a
huge bonus and I instantly switched over
to the music profile preset to listen to
some tunes and things sounded pretty
great already this wasn't the true test
for these devices in tandem though the
true test was surround sound instantly
was enabled and I didn't have to do
anything to set it up I simply jumped
into black ops 3 and started playing
around now the surround sound does work
but using these headphones it was
nothing compared to the experience and
soundstage offered by the Sound Blaster
XH 7s or the logitech g930 3s for
instance next I tested them with the H
5s and the surround sound was much more
impressive in fact I found them almost
indistinguishable from the h 7s so those
that only H 5s already and have been
considering an upgrade to the h 7s could
possibly save some money and just grab
the g1 instead overall I think the g1 is
a really cool little product that will
enable lots of gamers with stereo
headsets that they already like to
upgrade to surround sound without
breaking the bank at 50 US dollars the
g1 isn't yet available at retailers in
Australia and I could only find it for
purchase on eBay for a ridiculous $134
but I expect once it's more widely
available it might be around the 70 to
80 dollar mark which would make it a
reasonable by the O Vanna ANC's are a
great travel companion and I'll
certainly be using them myself for my
upcoming trips they're especially
awesome on the plane the carry case is a
great touch the noise cancellation works
really well there are 130 US dollars on
Amazon and currently listed for a $250
on creatives Australian website like the
g1 I heard prices are a little lower
once they're available in Australian
retailers and online stores thanks for
joining me again I'm your host Matt as
always and I'll see you guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
