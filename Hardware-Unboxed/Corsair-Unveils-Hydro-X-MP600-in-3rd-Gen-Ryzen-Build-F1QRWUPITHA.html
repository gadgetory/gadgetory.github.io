sponsoring our trip to Computex 2019
please check out their range of Intel
based motherboards via the link in the
video description also thank you to
Corsair for their support please check
out all their exciting new products via
the link in the video description and
coincidentally we'll be looking at some
of them in this video
welcome back to harbor unboxed we are at
the Corsair suite in the Grand Hyatt
I've got Tim on the camera holding a
light very awkwardly a microphone all
that later anyway he's doing a good job
we've just come across this Corsair one
concept now if you guys remember I built
a well similar systems what this is in
the fantex shift X and basically this
system would blow mine out of the water
and I reckon it would also run cooler
there's a lot of hot air just pumping at
the top of this thing surprisingly quiet
though for the amount of air that's
coming out but it has a core I 999 ATX e
and then an NVIDIA GeForce Titan RT X
graphics card in this little Corsair
ones that's a concept system they're
calling it the one pro I 199 so pretty
cool system there but that's not really
why we're here
we're here to check out their new hydro
ex liquid cooling gear so we'll go do
that now ok so this is what we've made
the trip out for course as new and very
massive range of hydro X bits this
stuff's been in the works for a very
long time now but that's understandable
as course I wanted to make their jump
into the dy I custom liquid cooling
market with a full range of products so
that means multiple CPU water blocks GPU
blocks radiators and boatloads of
fittings starting with the CPU blocks
Corsairs launched with two models and
they look very similar here we have the
X c7 which is the more mainstream
offering designed for Intel LGA 1150
series sockets and of course aim DS am
for socket the XC 7 features a nickel
plated copper heat pipe more than 60
micro fins and it comes with a
pre-applied Tim it's also only available
in black well at least for now anyway
then there's the XC 9 and this cpu block
is designed for high-end desktop
platforms such as Intel LGA 2066 socket
and AMD's TR for socket the coldplay is
slightly larger allowing it to
accommodate for more than 70 micro fins
then as you've probably noticed the xc9
features a silver housing which does
reflect LED lighting very well speaking
of which both models features 16
addressable RGB LEDs that point
downwards and this gives a really cool
effect on the motherboard basically it
lights up the area around the CPU socket
and yet just provides a really cool
looking glow effect Corsa also has a few
GPU blocks on offer the ex g7 and this
supports RTX 20 series graphics cards
and we know of support for models such
as the 27 28 and 28 ETI all found as
additional models but we have heard they
will be offering a few different AIB
versions as well we were also told there
will be a version available that
supports the older Pascal GT X 1080 and
1080 TI
personally I really like the design of
course as GPU blocks the black aluminium
casting looks amazing and I really like
how there's the cut out section and
allows you to see the liquid that flows
through the block and in addition to
that there's also a built-in flow
indicator so yeah that's very cool the
full-length aluminum backplate also
looks really nice and I like that
dominator memory style cover over the
Inlet and outlet ports that's also a
really nice touch the GPU blocks feature
over 50 copper fins on the cold plate
and these are nickel plated then on the
backside of the block you'll find a few
pre-installed thermal pads to help make
the installation a bit easier for now
there is just a single pump / reservoir
combo option which Corsair has named the
xd5 it's a smart little sub that
combines a high performance d5 pwm pump
with a 330 millimeter nylon reservoir
which is of course capped off nicely
with some RGB lighting there's also a
number of 30 and 55 millimeter thick
radiators the XR 5 range of radiators
measures 30 millimeters thick but comes
in 121 42 42 80 360 and 420 millimeter
sizes while the thicker xr-7 range is
available in 243 sixty and 480
millimeter sizes all feature a copper /
brass construction I look very good
as for fittings and tubing there's
already a pretty big range on offer here
with a number of different 12 millimeter
and 40 millimeter fittings available in
either black white or silver they also
have some cool it's an offer with the
new
xl5 range and these transparent coolers
are available in red green blue purple
or clear corsair says they feature
advanced anti-corrosion and
antibacterial inhibitors which won't
tarnish or damaged your blocks fittings
or tubing so we'll have to see how well
they work over a 6 to 12 month period
anyway the demo systems they had on
display looked amazing
Tim and I spent quite a bit of time
checking them out and we also spotted
the new Corsair MP 600 gen 4 PCIe nvme
SSD inside one of the builds we asked
about this one but we didn't get too
much information
we know that the MP 600 will be launched
around the same time as the third
generation processors in July but what
we do know for now is that this is
obviously a PCIe 4.0 x 4 device it uses
a Fire's on PS 50 16 a 16 controller and
we'll pack sequential read speeds of up
to four thousand nine hundred fifty
megabytes per second with sequential
write speeds of four thousand two
hundred and fifty megabytes per second
capacities haven't been yet announced so
we'll have to wait and see what happens
there so that concludes our tour of
Corsair suite this year saw a lot of
cool things really liked the hydro X
liquid cooling would have liked a closer
look at that MP 600 nvme SSD but yeah
they weren't taking those out of systems
so the b-roll we got was about as good
as you can get there obviously we can't
really test them out yet
sort of under NDA but anyway that stuff
along comes soon but let me know what
you guys thought of the new liquid
cooling gear do you want to see me maybe
upgrade the 1000 d build that the coffee
Ripper is probably gonna need an upgrade
anyway soon let us know thanks for
watching like subscribe do all that
stuff and we'll see you again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
