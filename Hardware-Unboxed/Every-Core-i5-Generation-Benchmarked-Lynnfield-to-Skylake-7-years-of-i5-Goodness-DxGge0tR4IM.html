I've been working hard to deliver it I'm
of course speaking about a core i5
version of February's five generations
of core i7 processors video which took
an in-depth look at gaming performance
on every mainstream core i7 processor
since 2012 Sandy Bridge 2600 K for this
video I've gone one better and included
every generation of Core i5 processors
released to date with the exception of
the dual core clarkdale processors
this means 2009 Linfield Core i5 750 has
been included along with Sandy Bridge
Ivy Bridge has well Broadwell and of
course skylight core i5 processors the
format for this video will be much the
same as the core i7 version all
processors have been locked at 4
gigahertz with any power saving or
throttling features disabled that said I
have tweaked the benchmarks ever so
slightly some of my most beloved critics
pointed out that in the previous core i7
comparison only GPU bound games we use
for testing obviously that wasn't true
given the inclusion of The Witcher 3
fallout 4 Just Cause 3 and Grand Theft
Auto 5 still of the nine games included
four of them were mostly GPU bound so
you might ask why include them in its
CPU comparison the reason is simple the
entire point of the comparisons are
trying to determine if game is still
rocking a Sandy Bridge processor really
need to upgrade to Intel's latest
skylake architecture testing the CPU
bound games doesn't really paint an
accurate or complete picture especially
when the majority of PC games are very
much GPU bound
games addicted to Star Wars Battlefront
for example receive the same performance
with either the core i7 2670 K even when
running extreme GPU setups whilst the
opposite is true in any of the CPU bound
games I just mentioned still in an
effort to try and keep everyone happy I
have included ARMA 3 this time
ridiculously CPU bound open-world
military tactical shooter also included
is civilization beyond Earth and ashes
of the singularity which was tested both
in the DirectX 11 and DirectX 12 modes
there's a heap of data in this video so
for those that want to quickly check out
all the graphs it might be best to check
the link in the description to the
text-based version at our website I'm
starting with Star Wars
Battlefront a game which we already know
isn't very CPU demanding at least in the
single-player tutorial mode where I have
to test for accurate results this is a
great indicator of typical game player
where the GPU is the limiting factor
here we see that even the lowly old 760
is able to deliver strong performance
with the gtx 980ti
as expected the GTX 970 results are much
the same only the 760 falls behind the
pack though not by a significant margin
battlefront was also tested using a pair
of Radeon r9 390x graphics cards in
crossfire here we see that while the
all-important minimum frame rates are
surprisingly close the more recently
released core i5 models delivered better
top-end performance like battlefront
battlefield 4 is another popular title
that at least when playing the
single-player mode isn't very CPU
demanding here are all six processors
including the 760 provided competitive
results with the gtx 980ti similar
performance trends were seen when
downgrading the GPU to the GTX 970 and
it's only the 760 that falls a few
frames behind the newer Core i5 models
now with a pair of 390x graphics cards
we see that there's a slight difference
in performance between most of the Core
i5 processors still it's important to
note that even the 760 was able to push
past the 120 FPS barrier without dipping
below 100 FPS at any time which is very
surprising at least to me here we have
yet another mostly CPU bound
first-person shooter that even the old
core i5 760 still plays well with and
all these results with the gtx 980ti
both impressive and surprising as you'd
expect downgrading the GPU to the gtx
970 only reduce the performance margins
and here we see the skylake 6600 k
beating the old 760 by just 5 FPS which
equates to a mere 7% performance margin
increasing the rendering firepower with
to 390 X graphics cards only solve for
FPS separate the minimum frame rate of
the 760 and the 6600 K civilization
beyond Earth places a fair load on the
CPU though the results we see when
testing with the gtx 980ti just 1080p
aren't extreme the 6600 K is just temps
and faster than the Sandy Bridge Base
2500 K that said the Broadwell 56 75 C
provided the best result with a minimum
of 84 fps and a 150
the FPS average moving to the GTX 970
reduced the margin between the Haswell
Broadwell and sky processors they can
all be seen dipping to just 80 FPS with
a similar average result the Linfield
760 really bombed out in this test
dropping it was 55 FPS making it 31
percent slower than the Haswell part and
25 percent slower than the 2500 k that
came after it I should point out that
there was no 390x crossfire testing for
this title since crossfire wasn't
working this is the case for quite a few
of the games we tested with
unfortunately things get crazy in our
fallout 4 boston city tests and here
games require some serious cpu firepower
the 56 75 c comes out ahead here as i
suspect it's able to put that massive l4
cache to good use
we see a nice progression in performance
from Sandy Bridge to Ivy Bridge and then
to Haswell which is nice
the core i5 760 really struggling this
title with frame dips as low as 33 FPS
because the section of Fallout 4 that we
benchmark is so extremely CPU bound
downgrading to the GTX 970 has a very
limited impact on performance Grand
Theft Auto 5 is one of the best examples
we have of a well balanced game and it
does a good job of taking advantage of
the latest hardware that's said with the
gtx 980ti handling the rendering the
4690k
56 75 C and 6600 K were virtually
indistinguishable the performance did
start to drop off with the 35 70 K and
was reduced further by the 2500 K
although the frame rates were still very
high the 760 was good but slower than
the more modern Core i5 processors
interestingly the core i5 760 recovered
somewhat with the GTX 970 was able to
match the 2500 K still the 35 70 K was a
decent step up from the 2500 K and the
4690k provided yet another step forward
before we hit a brick wall with the new
abroad well and skylake processors Just
Cause 3 is a super fun and very CPU
intensive game that said even with the
gtx 980ti gaming at just 1080p the Sandy
Bridge 2500 K does very well the same
unfortunately can't be said for the 760
which dropped almost 30% lower than the
2500 K of 48 fps even with the slower
GTX 970 handling the rendering the 760
still looks pretty slow it allowed the
framerate to hit 47 fps
at times though admittedly the average
framerate isn't that bad Just Cause 3 is
another title doesn't support crossfire
so we skip testing the three 90s
graphics cards here as well
Rainbow six seed isn't very CPU
intensive at all and as a result the
core i5 760 is able to hang in there
with the much newer core i5 processors
the 760 kept the minimum frame rate
above 120 fps so obviously game is very
playable on this processor the GTX 970
provided similar performance margins and
although the 760 was the only CPU to dip
below 100 FPS at 92 fps the game was
still very playable rise of the Tomb
Raider was a game that I initially
thought it was quite CPU intensive when
first played as it does make quite good
use of at least four threads however as
you can see even the 760 is able to hang
with the much newer i5 processors such
as the 6600 K for example GTX 970 so the
76020 500 K and 35 70 K all delivered
the exact same performance while the
newer Core i5 processors were just a
frame or two faster testing for The
Witcher 3 Wild Hunt took place at the
town of novigrad here the game is quite
CPU demanding despite that the
performance margin between the 2500 K
and 6600 K was almost non-existent it
was only the 760 that dropped off in
performance albeit by just 5 fps when
comparing the minimum frame rates the
GTX 970 provided some interesting
results and the 760 was able to match
the 2500 K here which meant essentially
it wasn't really any slower than the
newer Core i5 processors which is
another really big surprise when we move
to the 398 crossfire configuration the
760 does start to look dated
and although the minimum frame rate here
isn't that poor the average frame rate
would suggest the 760 spent quite a bit
of time rendering less than 60 FPS now
for the game many of you have no doubt
been waiting for ARMA 3 this game puts a
serious stranglehold on the CPU and this
can be seen when testing the gtx 980ti
although the 6600 K 56 75 C and 4690k
all provided similar performance there
was a huge drop in framerate when moving
to the 35 70 K from the 4690k to 35 70 K
the minimum frame rate dropped by 15%
and we saw a further eight percent drop
when going from the 35 70 K to the 2500
K
finally we bottomed out a 50
9 FPS with the 760 making a 30% slower
than the sky like an Haswell processors
now with the GTX 970 we fall just short
of 80 FPS with the higher-end Core i5
processors while they saw a significant
reduction in performance we're moving
from the gtx 980ti to the 970 the same
wasn't true for the older 2500 K and 760
in fact those processors drop just one
to two frames which meant the 760 was
just 17 percent slower than the Haswell
Broadwell and skylake processors the
best example we currently have of
DirectX 12 performance is ashes of the
singularity in my opinion so I've added
some DirectX 11 and DirectX 12
comparison testing with all six Core i5
processors using the gtx 980ti gtx 970
and fury X using the gtx 980ti we find
some interesting results the more modern
more powerful Core i5 processors were
actually faster when using DirectX 11 as
in videos gtx 980ti is still more
efficient here due to its hardware
design and more efficient drivers as the
cpu performance is reduced we see the 35
70 K provides the same performance in
DirectX 11 and DirectX 12 by the time we
hit the Sandy Bridge 2500 K the
processor efficiency has dropped to a
level where the lower CPU overhead of
the DirectX 12 API overcomes any
shortcomings of the gtx 980ti as DirectX
12 performance in this title the 760
amplifier's is further as now the
gameplay is significantly better in
DirectX 12 mode due to the fact that CPU
isn't holding the GPU up as much as
we've found more often than not the
slower GTX 970 evens up the playing
field though again the 760 is faster and
running in DirectX 12 looking at the
DirectX 12 results the fury X performs
exceptionally well and the 2500 K
through the 6600 K are able to get the
absolute maximum performance from this
high-end graphics card DirectX 12 also
helps out the core i5 760 significantly
and although it's still much slower than
even the 2500 K it does provide very
playable 50 fps first up we have the
power consumption results from tomb
raider using the gtx 970 and as you can
see there have been improvements along
the way with the exception of Broadwell
and its power-hungry l4 cache skylake
system continued apes and less power
than the Haswell system a 19% less than
the Sandy Bridge
system these note where the improvements
that they'll probably fail to blow the
socks off the average gamer the
cpu-bound just course or a similar 20%
reduction in power usage when going from
the 2500 K to the 6600 cave
interestingly the heavily overclocked
Linfield 760 at 4 gigahertz only
consumed an extra watt when compared to
the 2500 k finally before wrapping
things up I've provided some memory and
cache performance for those interested
Sandy Bridge was tested with ddr3 2133
memory this was the high frequency we
could maintain 100% stability with the
760 was limited to 18 33 megahertz well
if you've made it this far
congratulations and if you just hit
conclusion in the video index then shame
on you before I break down the results
let me just say this video isn't meant
to disappoint or upset those who
invested in one of Intel's latest guy
processes hell I've knowingly purchased
a few of them myself
after all if I were building a new
computer today at the top of my wish
list would be a sky core i5 or i7
processor instead the point of this
video is to provide those that are still
rocky an older generation processor a
clear indication of the kind of
performance they stand to gain by
upgrading going all the way back to the
first core i5 process is based on the
Linfield architecture we see that
Schaick offers a very real performance
improvement and even Sandy Bridge was a
decent step forward that's there for the
most part when paired with a relatively
high end GPU such as the GTX 970 the
core i5 760 was able to deliver very
playable performance in most of the
games tested it's really only the
extreme titles such as fallout 4 Just
Cause 3 and ARMA 3 where there's extra
frames do make a noticeable difference
of course out of the box the core i5 760
is going to be significantly slower than
what was seen here as it operates at
just 2.8 gigahertz so be sure to keep
that in mind the same can be said for
the 3.3 gigahertz
though the fully unlocked clock
multiplier makes that a dead easy CPU to
overclock performance wise the margins
are very similar to those found when
testing the core i7 processors if we
look at the CPU intensive titles only
here's what we find using the GTX 970
the skylake and Broadwell processes are
fourteen percent faster than the Sandy
Bridge 2500 K and eight percent faster
than 35 70 K they were however 25
percent faster than the 760 that is
a huge game given the seven year age gap
with the faster 980ti handling the
rendering the sky leak and has all
processes were again just 14% faster
than the Sandy Bridge 2500 K that said
they were now 35 percent faster than the
760 naturally the margins will grow when
using more powerful GPU configurations
particularly if SLI crossfire is
employed for example now if we look at
the non CPU intensive titles we find
very different results using it the gtx
980ti or GTX 970 the top tied CPUs such
as the 6600 K 56 75 C and 4690k were all
well under 10% faster than the 760 while
they provided virtually the same
performance as the 2500 K so depending
on what games you play it is possible to
make do with a very old Core i5
processor in today's games running a
respectable GPU that said when the CPU
is called to action at times the 760
looked a little slow though admittedly
that didn't happen often still I could
easily justify the upgrade to Haswell
Broadwell or sky from Linfield I
probably couldn't say the same for Sandy
Bridge and certainly not for Ivy Bridge
DirectX 12 isn't going to bury these
older generation processors either that
was something a few viewers were arguing
in the core i7 video ashes of the
singularity which is a very
well-put-together title and is extremely
CPU intensive shows how DirectX 12
doesn't hurt slower processes but rather
lens of a helping hand the gtx 980ti and
fury x results are a perfect example of
this looking at the fury x results which
are the most extreme we said that
although Sandy Bridge folds away
slightly under DirectX 11 that isn't the
case when using DirectX 12 here it's
able to match the performance of the
Haswell and sky chips
although DirectX 12 helps much older
Core i5 760 it wasn't able to completely
make up the performance deficit there
are obviously still similar imitations
here that can't be overcome by the
low-level API that's hardly surprising
so for now it appears as though DirectX
12 is only going to prolong the life of
processes such as the 2500 K rather than
ended virtual reality is another hot
topic and I was told a few times in
regards to the core i7 video that 2600 K
would struggle with VR as a minimum of
90 FPS as desired I don't know about you
but a mere 12% drop in performance from
the 6600 K to the 2500 cable
looking solely at CPU intensive games
tell me the 2500 K should be VR ready so
for now the gaming future looks bright
for anyone rocking a Sandy Bridge Core
i5 or newer and I suspect that too good
many of you thanks for joining me again
