surround sound USB headset the void and
hopefully unlike the Protoss air unit
they aren't just for noobs this gaming
headset is courses premier wired headset
so I'm expecting pretty good things
having played with a few other corsair
products in the past first let's take a
look at the design the extendable
headband is thick and solid and branded
Corsair across the top it does offer a
little flex but also feels quite weighty
and adds to what I would say is a pretty
heavy headset here cup arms swivel 90
degrees allowing them to sit on the
right angle on your head and also sit
flat on the desk which I like the ear
cuffs themselves are able to pan up and
down a little bit too which is good but
this is something I'll come back to a
little later the outside of ear cuffs
looks pretty cool and this particular
model comes in black with red features
the design combines smooth contours with
some sharp angles to produce a pretty
unique look one that I think certainly
does look pretty specifically like a
gaming headset comfort wise I described
the void headset is good I like the way
the ear cut mesh wasn't just round
instead of shaped more like Nia
initially when I opened up the package I
had a look at these holes and thought
there's no way my ears are gonna fit in
there comfortably however I was wrong
base is clever shaping now as I
mentioned earlier the void is not the
lightest headset going around the build
feels solid but as a result they're not
the lightest and I could see them
weighing on you over a long gaming
session I also had an issue where I felt
like that didn't quite wrap around my
head properly the ear cup feels like
most of the weight is kind of sitting at
the top of my ears and there was a
slight gap at the bottom with some
fiddling I could kind of get it into the
right position but they definitely
wouldn't sit there naturally or if I
threw them on quickly the padding on the
ear cups and headband is standard stuff
as mentioned not the plush memory foam
found on some other headsets however
once they're on my head I didn't really
notice this too much it's like I said
before comfort wise the board is good
but unfortunately I wouldn't go as far
to say that they're great in terms of
connectivity this edition of the void is
wide but you can also get a wireless
version
attached is a reasonably long rubber
cable with a four pole three-and-a-half
millimeter jack at the end
in this configuration the headset is
just a standard stereo headset with a
built-in mic package with the void
surround is a cool little USB Dolby
dongle that adapts the cable to a USB
and enables a 7.1 surround sound pretty
cool what's especially cool though is
that you can use this dongle with any
stereo headset to to achieve surround
sounds how good is that I think the
sound performance is probably the best
part of the Void headset it utilizes
large 50 millimeter drivers to produce a
broad range of quality sound for a
headset under $100 I haven't heard a lot
that it better these are of course not
going to rival headsets in the 250 to
$300 range however they definitely
perform well over music movies and of
course games I can often find cheaper
headsets painful for listening to music
parts of songs you love are often
compromised however this wasn't really
the case with the voids Corsairs utility
engine software can be used to customize
the EQ adjust mic levels switch between
EQ presets and you can save and switch
your own profiles too but this is pretty
much all that can be done the mic
performance however was not quite as
satisfactory and was much more in line
with the headsets pricing it took quite
a bit of fiddling with the mic gain and
volume to get it to a point where my
rocket League teammates could hear me
without having very annoying amount of
clicking on SS and T's I've done my best
to record this section as an example
currently priced at a very reasonable 80
USD or quite unfortunate of 160 AUD
whether or not I would recommend this
headset somewhat depends not just on
your location but also what you plan to
do with it if you're a multiplayer gamer
that's constantly on mumble or discord
then I probably suggest looking for
something with a better mic I'd also
recommend finding somewhere you can try
one on first I recognises this objective
and heads are all different shapes but
for me this didn't quite sit right for
the 80 US dollar price tag though the
sound performance is very impressive and
the little Dolby USB dongle is a great
little adaptable feature that I think
I'll get plenty of use out of over time
all in all the void surround is a solid
entry from Corsair for PC gamers they're
chasing that surround sound but don't
want to break the bank in the process
thanks for watching another gaming
headset review I'm your host Matt and
I'll see you guys next time
