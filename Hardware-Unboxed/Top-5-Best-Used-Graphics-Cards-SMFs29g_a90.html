graphics card prices are coming down
they still aren't great but compared to
this time last month they are much
improved and appear as though they will
continue to fall over the coming weeks
and months not that long ago I put
together a video that I titled the
ultimate 44 used GPU benchmark and price
guide and in it there were loads of
graphs chock-full of pricing and
performance data the 15 minute video was
a bit of an information overload for
some so here's a more to the point
version here are the best value used
options on the market right now starting
at just under $100 u.s. right up to just
over $200 US if you want more
information about why each of these
graphics cards was chosen then please do
check out the original video I'll
provide a link in the video description
those are two gtx 1050 light performance
but don't want to pay the hundred eighty
dollar us asking price the GTX 670 is
the graphics card to get and it also
just outpaced the GTX 760 and 960 in our
tests at roughly one hundred dollars us
less it is a great option for bargain
hunters and although last week's auction
price was eighty five dollars us or at
least the average auction price I did
see quite a few examples go for under
$60 so keep your eye out for a bargain
if you can swing it though the gtx 770
offers around 25% more performance for
the GTX 670 though the average selling
price is 60% higher so keep that in mind
so in terms of cost per frame it is
around 20% more expensive but in
situations where you jump up from 40 FPS
to 50 FPS it is very noticeable and for
$50 more it's going to be well worth the
upgrade for a lot of gamers particularly
those playing titles such as pub G for
example on a final note the GTX 680 is
basically the same product but with
slower memory and it can often be had
for around $20 or less so keep an eye
out for those as well
the Radeon r9 280x has dropped
significantly in price over the past
month and around the same level of
performance as a GTX 770 it's really
equally as good a value for those after
strong 1080p gaming although it is just
a rebadged 7970 the older version that's
usually for whatever reason self more an
option so if you can get a 7970 cheaper
than perhaps do that because as I said
it is the same product but based on what
I'm seeing you're probably best off
focusing on that 280x the 280x
is the only radio and GPU to make this
list great performers like the 290 and -
honey acts are just simply too expensive
the GeForce GTX 970 is probably the
easiest graphics card to find on the
second-hand market last month alone over
300 of them sold at auction on eBay and
performance wise the 970 really is still
a beast even if it does only have three
and a half gigabytes of high-speed
memory in terms of performance it's on
par with the previous generation gtx 780
which makes it around 15% slower than
gtx 1066 gigabyte but today's prices
it's at least 40% cheaper
finally the GTX 780 is the last pick for
my top five best used GPUs to be on the
lookout for as I said in terms of
performance the 780 and 970 are very
similar which makes the 970 a better
option as it is newer and generally
costs around the same amount and
consumes less power still if you can't
get your hands on a GTX 970 and you're
after a mid-range graphics card then the
GTX 780 is a nice alternative well there
you have it my top 5 best used GPUs list
again for more information please check
out the video I titled the ultimate 44
used GPU benchmark and price guide if
you're looking to spend under $100 there
are more examples in that video I do
realize almost all the recommendations
here for Nvidia graphics cards but don't
for a second believe it that's because
we're Green Team biased or anything
silly like that
facts are just facts and right now the
GeForce GPUs are cheaper because they
are less attractive for cryptocurrency
miners anyway that is your dirt for this
one if you enjoyed the video be sure to
