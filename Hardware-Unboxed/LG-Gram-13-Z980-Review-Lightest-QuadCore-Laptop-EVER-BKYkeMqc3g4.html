looking at the LG gram which falls into
my favorite category of laptops high-end
slim and light machines now this latest
version of the LG gram has been around
for a few months now and you might have
already seen some reviews of the
flagship 15-inch model however when LG
asked if I was interested in reviewing
the ground I put in a specific request
to get the smaller 13-inch entry-level
model after all a lot of buyers
interested in the cheaper configurations
and the 13-inch variant sounded more
compelling to me most of the hardware
here won't come as a surprise we're
looking at an Intel Core i5
8250 new processor and this is actually
the first time I've looked at Intel's
8th gen quad core Core i5 for laptops
though of course you can configure the
system up to a core i7
8550 you if you'd like there's also 8
gig of ram a 256 gig SSD a 13 inch 1080p
display and an enormous 72 watt hour
battery all of this will set you back a
touch under $1000 or thereabouts through
Amazon but the cave feature of the
Graham really isn't the internal
hardware which is quite similar to a lot
of other laptops at this price point
instead the major selling point is its
portability particularly its weight the
LG Graham 13 weighs just 965 grams well
below the typical 1.2 to 1.4 kilograms
for a laptop of this size and class and
it's immediately noticeable this is by
far the lightest laptop I've held with
this level of hardware inside so if
you're keen on portability that Graham
is a standout option the weight is
really where the grams portability comes
from the overall dimensions and
footprint are pretty similar to other
laptops with LG opting for slim but not
invisible bezels around the display
luckily this approach to bezels has
meant the webcam can remain above the
display so no nostril vision like you'd
get with the Dell XPS 13 at 15
millimeters thick it's not amazingly
thin either but around the same mark as
other laptops and the thickness does
allow the laptop to include a full-sized
HDMI port and two full-sized USB ports
speaking of other ports you also get a
USB 3.0 type C
and a microsd card slot along with the
proprietary charging port it's
disappointing the gram doesn't include
Thunderbolt 3 on the 13-inch models that
feature is restricted to the larger
15-inch variant and also would have been
nice if it charged the USB see I'm not
sure why LG opted for a micro SD card
slot over a full SD card slot either as
micro SD isn't nearly as useful as USB
on a laptop like this anyway with such a
light laptop you're probably wondering
about build quality the entire chassis
is constructed from a magnesium alloy
similar to Microsoft Surface devices
however it doesn't feel quite as
texturally magnificent as other premium
metal builds in this nor a visual
interest to the design for better or
worse for the most part it's a simple
functional design and for many buyers
that would be perfectly fine as the
durability LG does take the laptop
passes the MAL STD 810g test suite with
shocks up to 20 G's and drops from over
1.2 meters there's bit of flex to the
keyboard area but no more than a typical
ultraportable the real area of weakness
I found was a significant amount of flex
to the display assembly
it just feels weak and floozie in that
area which is a by-product of the weight
reduction luckily I don't think it's a
big issue unless you enjoy it bending
the display in your spare time and even
though there's a touchscreen on this
particular laptop it doesn't make a huge
impact the keyboard and trackpad are
both a standard affair for a laptop
nothing overly amazing but no glaring
issue either each key has a solid if
slightly rubbery response with an
ultrabook level travel distance not
quite as quicky as my favorite HP
laptops but I typed a lengthy document
on this laptop the other day and had no
problem with the response or layout the
trackpad is large enough very responsive
and the sensitivity level to be honest
is perfect for a power user like me if
you love to use your laptop's built-in
speakers though I'd steal well clear of
the ground the speakers are not good at
all and the bottom firing design tends
to get blocked when using laptop on your
lap
probably another area that was
compromised when what needed to be cut
however there is a fingerprint reader
integrated to the power button and it
works really well I wish more laptops
included fingerprint readers I think
they're quite handy the display it's a
fairly typical ultra portable panel it's
a 13.3 inch IPS LCD
with the resolution of 1920 by 1080 and
a basic 60 Hertz refresh my review unit
came with the touchscreen however the
base model on Amazon does not the touch
model is slightly more expensive and
will feature a slightly reduced battery
life due to the digitizer display
performance is decent with the peak
brightness of 311 nits contrast ratio of
1032 1 and acceptable viewing angles LG
seems to have calibrated the panel to a
reasonable standard though it's not
perfect achieving a CCT average of 66
13k a grayscale averaged l28 of 3.2 to
an average delta is between 2.5 and 3.0
across the saturation and color checker
tests Delta is below 1.0 a dead accurate
and anything below 2.0 is very good the
Graham is just outside these metrics and
it's certainly better than other laptops
I've looked at if you want to calibrate
the LG Graham 13 S display using
software like spectra Cal's Calment 5
you can achieve very solid results with
no impact of brightness or contrast
ratio I push Delta is below 1.0 across
the board improve the gamut and
tightened up the temperature response
that's about as good as you could hope
for this sort of display and through
maintaining 98% srgb coverage images
still look fantastic if you have an LG
Graham 13 and you want the ICC profile I
generated for this laptops display
that's available over on our patreon
page do note there is some variance
between displays and my profile won't
necessarily be as accurate on other
units but it's usually better than
nothing the only real downside I found
to the display is uniformity and even
then we're only talking about a Delta II
deviance of about 3.0 along the bottom
edge there is no clear backlight bleed
issue it's just a small amount of
unevenness in the backlighting not a big
deal and in general I'm pretty impressed
with the display to be honest let's move
on to performance like a lot of base
model ultra portable configurations the
LG Graham starts with an Intel Core i5
8250 you an 8 gig of ddr4 2400 in a dual
channel configuration we haven't spent a
lot of time with the 8250 you in the
past so it would be good to see how it
compares to the core i7 a 550 you found
in appetit configurations like most of
Intel's hnk be like refresh line the age
review features four cores and eight
threads constraints are typically a 15
watt TDP while manufacturers can choose
the TDP configuration LG
13 since it the default 15 what these
four cores have a base clock of 1.6
gigahertz and a boost of 3.4 gigahertz
no matter the core usage this is in
contrast to the 8550 that features a
slightly higher 1.8 gigahertz base clock
but a boost that varies from 3.7 all
core to 4.0 give hertz in single and
dual core workloads it's quite clear
looking just at these specs of the 8550
holds a decent clock speed advantage in
short single core tasks the other main
difference is in cache where the 8250
features 6 megabytes instead of 8
megabytes like with the core i7 range
the integrated GPU is still in tells you
HD 620 with 24 execution units and clock
speed of eleven hundred megahertz just
fifty megahertz lower than the core i7s
so how does the Core i5
8250 you differ from the core i7 8550
you and is it worth paying the extra
money to get the cry 7 model well let's
take a look at the performance
difference first looking at 16 different
productivity benchmarks the i-5 8250 u
is on average 15% slower than the core
i7 8550 you in this case the 15 watt
configuration found in the razor blade
stealth in some tests like Excel and
premiere the deficit is as large as 26%
and in other tests like PC mark that
difference is a single-digit percentage
for those that prefer percentage gains
the 8550 u is 19% faster than the 8250 u
on average though again there is a
variance among test lengths and core
utilization right now the price
difference between the core i5 and core
i7 models of the LJ gram 13 is a hundred
and fifty dollars or 14% more for the
core i7 model considering you get 19%
more performance on average that sounds
like a pretty good deal unfortunately
there doesn't appear to be a
configuration that delivers more than
eight gig of ram or more than a 256gb
SSD bizarrely you can only get sixteen
gig of ram and a 512 gig SSD out of the
box with the 15-inch model both the 14
and 13 inch units are left out
however the 13 inch cry 7 model does
come with eight gig of soldered ram and
a freedom slot making a 16 gig dual
channel configuration possible if you're
willing to upgrade a laptop yourself the
core i5 model like the one I have to
review has four gigs soldered at another
four gig in that dim slot so a nice
extinct configuration is a bit harder
luckily you can upgrade the SSD with all
units oh and before I forget let's take
a look at how the gram 13 stacks up
compared to older CPUs which are
probably what most buyers will be
upgrading from the Wi-Fi of 8250 new
model I review provides a handy
twenty-two percent average performance
upgrade on the core i5 7200 you know
that gain can be as high as 72 percent
in heavily multi-threaded workloads
compared to a core i7 7500 you you get
about 18 percent more performance though
again that's high in multi-threaded
tasks as for the 85 50 you variant well
we didn't test that model specifically
but we do know the 85 refused
approximately 31 percent faster than the
i7 7500 you on average with gains closer
to the 50 percent mark in all core
workloads either way you look at it the
core i7 8550 you or the core i5 8250 you
will provide a ton more power than
seventh gen or all the CPUs the one main
downside the system performance is the
SSD the 256 gig unit included with the
gram 13 is just as sad as Samsung PM 871
drive with performance capped around the
500 megabyte per second mark for
sequential transfers the best laptops
like the Dell XPS 13 use an nvme drive
with performance in the gigabyte per
second range where is this SATA Drive
you're not getting anything like that
considering you can't get a
configuration with more than 256 gig of
storage anyway it could be worth
swapping it out yourself if you're keen
on the grams of the strengths the
grounder 13 it does have an active
cooler for the CPU however I was quite
impressed with it under the full load of
a handbrake
x264 encoder the cooler is quiet
producing just 34 DBA from 50
centimeters away the surface
temperatures are also kept in check I
recorded 43 degrees Celsius in the upper
middle of the keyboard and 36 degrees on
the underside
one of the areas I was most interested
in is battery life with a 72 watt hour
battery inside the 38 Morel the Graham
13 is loaded with more battery capacity
than most competing laptops which
typically top out around the 50 to 60
watt hour mark the touchscreen included
with my review net will sip a bit more
power than the base model without touch
however I was still expecting very good
results from the Graham and across the
battery test I ran the
delivered battery life was either at or
near the top of the charts in every test
delivering some of the best results I've
seen from the past couple of generations
of laptops I've tested
despite the quad-core CPU inside the
Graham even does well in battery tests
that are more CPU intensive which is
great news for those that want to run
power-hungry workloads off the charger
all up there's many reasons to be
impressed with the 13-inch Graham it
provides a highly portable design great
performance especially if you get the
core i7 model excellent battery life and
a very good display if you want a system
that simply provides portability
performance and stamina the Graham could
be the exact laptop you're after however
and this is the case with almost every
laptop out there the Graham is not
perfect
while the areas I just mentioned our
strengths these laptops feature set is
bare-bones it's missing Thunderbolt 3
and a full sized SD card slot and you
aren't getting a fast nvme SSD while the
laptop is upgradable out of the box
configurations are limited to just eight
gig of ram and a 256 gig SSD I don't
think these things will be crucial
emissions for a lot of prospective
buyers but if you want the complete
package
you might want to look elsewhere as for
pricing you can get the base core i5
Morel for around $1000 and the core i7
model for around 1250 though the flat
top isn't officially available in
Australia the core i7 model is the best
value and both models are cheaper than
equivalently configured laptops from
major competitors I still really like
the Zenbook 13 UX 331 un due to its
discrete GPU but the Grande 13 is
undoubtedly a more portable option
that's it for this review if you're
