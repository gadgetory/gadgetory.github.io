got a let's play for you as we check out
a new title called strange Brigade did I
say let's play I of course mean let's
benchmark before I get to the loads of
results that I have for you what is
strange Brigade and why am i
benchmarking it I have to admit until a
few weeks ago I had never actually heard
of this game although it was announced
ahead of III 2017
I personally hadn't caught wind of it
until recently when a media announced
their raise the game bundle which is a
game bundle they include with the Radeon
rx Vega series the rx 580 and even the
rx 570 in case your honor where the game
bundle includes three upcoming games
Assassin's Creed Odyssey star control
origins and strange Brigade the
promotion's currently active and all run
until the 3rd of November 2018 and it's
valid for those purchasing one of the
aforementioned radio and graphics cards
via direct ad inboard sales OMS and
system integrators as for strange
Brigade well in short it's a cooperative
third-person shooter developed and
published by rebellion developments the
cart mode supports four players and put
some in roles of 1930s era tomb raiders
I suppose think Indiana Jones the story
goes something like this there is an
ancient and long dead Egyptian queen set
a key who's been raised from the dead by
some evil ritual in addition to Queen
set akise revival mummies zombies
minotaurs and giant Egyptian gods
populate the land
there's loads of killing using
conventional means such as guns and
grenades but characters have access to
magical powers which help to obliterate
the baddies more efficiently the actions
also broken up a bit by puzzles that
often involve shooting moving breaking
or otherwise interacting with the
environment I've played for about an
hour roll up now and even solo it's just
a heap of fun so I imagine with friends
it's gonna be pretty amazing anyway this
video is more about harbour performance
so let's talk about that and I've spent
about 48 hours playing the same section
of the game over and over again now so
yeah that's my idea of fun I know
I'm a simple man they gave support to
directx12 and Vulcan and we'll be
kicking off the testing by comparing the
radiant and GeForce GPUs using either
API and then we'll go from there strange
Brigade does include a demanding
built-in benchmark which I found to
deliver frame rates that were at least
fifteen percent lower than the most
demanding section of the game that I ran
into
within the first hour of gameplay anyway
normally I'd go for the more demanding
tests but both AMD and NVIDIA GPU
suffered a bit of stuttering during the
built in benchmark and this really hurt
frame time performance now this is an
issue I never actually saw when just
playing the game so I decided to measure
performance using a manual 60-second
in-game pass and reported the average
and 1% low result for the most part I
will be using the ultra quality preset
and testing takes place at 1080p 1440p
and 4k I'll also be enabling async
compute which improves performance for
the Radeon GPUs by about 5% and then
just a couple of percent for the GeForce
GPUs and I will look at those numbers
towards the end of the video the game
also supports Amy's free sync to HDR
technology but that isn't something that
we'll be testing in this video as usual
I'll be using my GPU test rig which is
built inside the corsair crystal 570 X
and comprises of a core i7 87 Eric a
clock to 5 gigahertz with 16 gigabytes
of vengence ddr4 3400 memory for the
GeForce GPUs the 398 e 2w hql driver was
used and for AMD the Radeon adrenaline
18-point 8.2 driver which is an
optimized driver for strange Brigade so
please note we are testing the game with
a game ready driver from AMD but not
from Nvidia so it is possible the Green
Team might see a performance uplift with
a future driver release though
performance does appear pretty spot-on
as you're about to see ok so before we
get too far into it let's compare the
DirectX 12 and Vulcan performance using
a few select AMD and NVIDIA GPUs
whichever API offers each team the best
performance is the API I plan to use for
that particular team and as you can see
here DirectX 12 looks to get the nod at
least at 1080p
the GTX 1080i is 11% faster using
DirectX 12 and we see an even larger
performer
uplift for the standard 1080 the
performance is more even with the RX
Vega GPUs but even here Vega 64 was 6%
faster using DirectX 12 and we see much
the same with Vega 56 as well
even at 1440p we see that DirectX 12
offers the Radeon GPUs a slight
performance bump while the GeForce GPU
enjoyed a rather significant performance
increase I should also note that AMD
provided me with some of their own
numbers and they also confirmed that
both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs offer greater
performance across the board using
DirectX 12 finally at 4k performance is
much the same for the radio and GPUs
using either API so at this extreme
resolution it doesn't really matter too
much which API use if you have a Vega
graphics card however GeForce owners
will certainly want to stick with
DirectX 12 as it offered an 18% increase
for the TE ti and 24% for the standard
1080 okay so that settles that I'm going
to conduct all further benchmarks in
this video using DirectX 12 as it offers
the best results for both Radeon and
GeForce owners of course I will continue
to monitor the performance of both api's
in the future but if you see us using
DirectX 12 exclusively for strange
Brigade then you'll know why it's
because it offers better performance
just quickly here's a look at the impact
async compute has by testing with it
enabled and disabled as you can see the
Radeon GPUs receive a 5 percent
performance boost while the GeForce GPU
is only see a 2 percent boost in either
case not massive but I suppose every bit
does help right so here are 20 current
generation AMD and NVIDIA GPUs tested at
jep using the DirectX 12 API and the
ultra quality preset so if you're hoping
to enjoy Strange Brigade in all of its
glory and keep frame rates above 60fps
at all times at 1080p what kind of
hardware are you looking at well for
that you'll want at least a Radeon rx
570 or GTX 1063 gigabyte which I have to
say is very reasonable
both pushed an average of around 90 fps
in our tests and a 1% low figure of over
60 FPS that most impressive we also see
similar performance from the Radeon rx
580 and 6 gigabyte GTX 1060 for low-end
models such as the rx 560 and GTX 1050
we'll likely want to reduce the quality
settings just a little bit and we will
explore that later in the video I'll
also include a whole heap of older
generation GPUs as well using the medium
quality settings for now though let's
move to the 1440p results and have
another look at the current generation
GPUs even here the mid-range GPU still
provide very playable performance but
for high refresh rate gaming you will
want at least a Vega 56 or gtx 1070
graphics card the leap from the gtx 1080
to the 1080i is a massive 35% and we saw
both the 1080i and tight necks destroy
vega 64 liquid vega 56 was at least
competitive with the gtx 1070 and 1070
STI so that's something then at 4k you
really need the gtx 1080i and i have to
say the experience was very impressive
91 FPS on average at 4k you don't really
see that too often especially in a game
it looks as great as strange brigade
gameplay really was incredibly smooth as
you'd expect with a 1% lower result of
75 FPS it's possible in other sections
of the game that the frame rate will
drop lower now the inbuilt benchmarks
certainly suggest that but i can't
imagine you'd be getting anywhere near
unplayable levels so strange brigades
certainly appears very well optimised so
let's move on to see how the previous
generation GPUs handle it for those of
you rocking a previous generation GPU
you still can look forward to some
pretty solid performance when playing
Strange Brigade at iupi using the ultra
quality preset the r9 390 beat out the
GTX 970 deliver 88 FPS on average
opposed to 81 FPS interestingly the r9
390x really wasn't much faster than the
non ex model and while edged ahead of
the GTX 980 for the average frame rate
the frame time performance was much
lower jumping to 1440 P and here we see
the gtx 970 and r9 390 are still getting
it done but ideally gamers will want a
gtx 980 or better it's very interesting
to note that AMD's r9 nano does much
better than the gtx 980
while the fury range isn't that far
behind the gtx 980ti of course you can
overclock the gtx 980ti for a further
20% performance boost but still for
stockers
the fury doesn't look too bad here then
at 4 okay we see well playable the
previous generation of flagship GPUs
really aren't going to cut it for 4k
gaming that said we're used to seeing
the 4 gigabyte HBM fury and nano GPUs
absolutely tanked at 4k but here they
actually beat the gtx 980ti by a
reasonable margin so that's certainly a
surprising result and finally time to
break out the magnifying glass for all
you mobile phone viewers if you've got
an 85 inch TV this graph might contain
some useful - harder what we have here
are all the current and previous
generation GPUs lumped together at te P
if you'd like to go over this data and
more thoroughly feel free to pause the
video and take a closer look then we
have slightly fewer GPUs at 1440p as the
entry level models have been dropped due
to extremely low frame rates so this
graph is slightly easier to read without
a projector again if you want to study
the graph a bit closer feel free to hit
the pause button then at 4k we've weeded
out the slow coaches and now we have
just 23 GPUs to check out that said if
you're after a smooth 4k experience your
options are very limited
moving on here is a quick look at
scaling performance using the for
quality presets with the geforce gtx
1066 Gilbert and Radeon rx 588 gigabyte
at 1440p we've already seen how these
GPUs perform using the ultra quality
settings but here we are able to drop
down to the high preset and that does
boost both GPUs by an additional 10%
then the medium quality preset allows
for an additional 24% performance boost
and then the low a further 22% increase
so those with Lawren gps certainly have
plenty of wriggle room to boost up those
frame rates oh and before I forget here
at the old bangers along with a few
current and previous generation
mid-range and entry-level options using
the medium quality preset at 1080p here
we have 17 very old GPUs mixed in with
13 current and previous generation GPUs
down the bottom of the graph we see the
GeForce GTX 580 mixing up with the GT
1030 it's pretty crazy to see the old
Radeon r9 290 smashed the GeForce GTX
780 Ti though the GTX 780
r9 2
and HD 7970 are all comparable there's a
few other graphics cards in that I have
a look at so again if you want to take a
closer look just feel free to pause the
video and well take a closer look well I
hope that helps those of you who are
wondering how well strange Brigade would
run your PC frankly I'm really impressed
with what we've seen here the game
appears to be very well optimised and
it's not just well optimised for AMD
hardware but also Nvidia hardware which
is great to see from an AMD sponsored
title in fact this is becoming somewhat
of a common trend I have to say and I'm
sure I'm not the only one who's noticed
that every game AMD has a hand in
developing turns out to be extremely
well optimised and not just for a MIDI
hardware but for NVIDIA hardware as well
and basically to enjoy this game and all
of its glory at 1080p and push over 60
fps at all times or at least for the
most part based on our little benchmark
pass all you need is an rx 570 or GTX
1063 gigabyte coincidentally if you've
just so happened to be in the market for
a new mid-range GPU and happen to wanna
play strange regard and are also keen on
star control origins and Assassin's
Creed Odyssey then AMD's raise the game
bundle couldn't have come at a better
time
right now the RX 570 is priced at $200
u.s. which isn't a bad deal given the
GTX 1063 gigabyte is currently selling
for around two hundred and twenty
dollars u.s. better yet though throw in
a $130 u.s. worth of games and you end
up paying just $70 u.s. for the graphics
card assuming you plan on buying all
three titles that is I still even if you
were to only buy one of these tiles
that's still a pretty solid deal anyway
I'm not trying to sell you on at rx 570
graphics card I'm sure it sounds like it
but I'm not Oh any Radeon graphics card
for that matter I just think that it's a
really good deal and if all of these
stars were to align for you then yeah
it's an extremely good deal anyway if I
can't sell you on a Radeon graphics card
how about a rise in CPU
I kid of course but AMD did point out
that strange Brigade includes rise and
optimizations something that we will
test at a later date the games compiled
using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 which
contains optimizations and improved
for modern processes like horizon
additionally multi-threaded command
buffer generation accelerates rendering
by distributing work onto multiple
logical processors AMD says as a result
gameplay is virtually indistinguishable
from competing processes from Intel
again I will compare AMD and Intel CPUs
in this title at a later date but for
now based on what I saw with the 8700 ok
it's fair to say that this isn't a
really CPU demanding title anyway so it
may not be particularly good for
benchmarking AMD and Intel CPUs perhaps
though that will change in the later
stages of the game it may become more
demanding there or perhaps with more
players but before I get a chance to
play any more strange Brigade or any
other games for that matter I really
need to finish the corsair 1000d build
aka coffee rip up as you can possibly
see here I don't know if it's in shot on
the camera very well but I've installed
both the 360 millimeter
front radiators and all 16 4 hands so
that's quite impressive and then I've
got the 400 I think it is 420 millimeter
radiator in the top so that's there I've
only got two fans that'll explain that
in the video and then I've got the
blocks installed I'm about to do the
graphics cards they're floating around
somewhere anyway that video was meant to
land today or tomorrow I've obviously
postponed that bigger they started
benchmarking on Friday and benchmarked
all throughout the weekend to get this
video done in time for Monday so you've
got that to look forward to it's gonna
be a pretty awesome build and I'm
excited to get into it as for this video
