weeks ago I put together a list of what
I felt were the worst CPU and GPU
purchases of 2017 and boy did that stir
up some discussion still overall many of
you really did seem to enjoy the
discussion and therefore requested a
best-of version so here it is my best
CPU and GPU purchases of 2017 let's get
into it
all right so no surprises to see you
then there isin five 1600 is without a
question this year's best value
performance desktop processor AMD slept
their most affordable six core 12 thread
CPU with an MSRP of $220 u.s. though
today you'll rarely pay more than say
$200 US for one the r5 1600 is really a
bit of an all-rounder there's no game it
can't deliver perfectly smooth
performance in and we expect it to be
good for many many years to come then
when it comes time to get serious I'm of
course talking about productivity
workloads nothing holds a candle to the
r5 1600 not at this price point a plus 3
workloads with impressive efficiency and
you're looking really at paying almost
twice as much from Intel for a similar
level of productivity performance to
sweeten the deal
AMD's even thrown in a decent box cooler
and is offered overclocking support on
sub $100 be 350 motherboards making it
an extremely cost-effective combo the
only buzzkill this year has been the
cost of ddr4 but this affects all
platforms and with the r5 1600 just
being so cheap many have just taken the
hit on memory pricing
as good as the r5 1600 is for practive
'ti workloads the risin 7 1700 is even
better of course because it does pack
33% more calls and threads that said
though in terms of value it's not quite
as good giving you our paying 50% more
for those extra cores and threads but
you know with time being money and all
the premiums probably worth it in late
2017 Rison 7 might be a bit less
impactful than say it was back in March
when it was released for the first time
but it still deserves to make our list
when it landed all those months ago
consumers seeking an eight-course 16
thread CPU were faced with paying $1,000
us for the core i7 6100 K so it's
important to look back and see where
we've come from the r7 1700 can now be
purchased for less than a third of that
price at $300 u.s. as a result the six
900k was retired now we have the core i7
78 20x for a more affordable $600 us
though an argue that the Rison 7 1700 is
still a much better value product again
the Rison 7 CPU can be paired with
relatively inexpensive motherboards and
while you can put them on be 350 boards
even a nice X 370 board can be had for
as little as a hundred and thirty
dollars u.s. meanwhile the cheapest x-29
boards they come in at around $200 u.s.
so for those that have a lot of work to
get done but don't want to spend big to
get it done rise in the sevens the
answer to their prayers
Brandin out my AMD appreciation video is
the risin thread ribbon 1950 x4 just shy
of $1000 you get a 16 core 32 thread CPU
now remember at the start of 2017 as I
just said an 8 core CPU would set you
back $1,000 a 10 core CPU though well 10
cores was just scary the core i7 650 X
came in at an asking price of 17 hundred
and fifty dollars u.s. today though well
today Intel cries itself to bed
remembering the good times so a grand
now lands you twice as many calls and
threads when compared to earlier in the
year a way that thread Ripper was
incoming Intel rush to their x29
platform into the wild so they could
strike first the problem being that
there 16 core 32 thread beasts will set
you back $1700 and while it is fast in
the 1950 X I'd say you still have to
spend around 1,200 to 1,400 dollars us
on the 12 or 14 core models to get 1950
excellent performance there are a number
of disadvantages to the thread Ripper
platform when compared to Skylark x but
ultimately I feel like it provides
consumers with the most bang for their
buck and it's where an invest my money
if I was after a high-end workstation
okay so I just like to point out that
due to the way things have gone in the
second half of the year
this picks a bit sketchy I'll admit
unfortunately the once great value
Pentium G 45 60 is kind of no longer at
least in most regions due to pricing so
while the previous AMD processors that I
talked about 100% deserve to make this
list this one's a bit more iffy the G 45
60 which I commonly referred to as the
only KB like CPU worth buying burst onto
the scene in January and at the time I
reviewed the hell out of it in fact I
was so obsessed with the value of the G
45 60 that a lot of you is more
favorable to the red variety CPUs let's
say we're getting a bit upset I still
don't care though how can you not love
what the G 45 60 offered back in the
first half of the year prior to its
release a dual-core hyper threading
enabled Intel CPU cost at least twice as
much so at 64 dollars us the G 45 60 was
a steal and really nothing could touch
it in terms of value it was so good in
fact that it wiped out pretty much the
rest of Intel's own KB Lake Pentium and
core i3 lineup until apparently caught
wind of this though and despite denying
it started to limit supply midway
through the year cryptocurrency miners
were blame for the shortage but even
today Intel seems in no hurry to offer
the G 4560 at $64 us again today bargain
hunters are faced with a less desirable
asking price of $80 us and in my opinion
you're better off getting the rise in
312 hundred at that price and the final
nail though in the g 45 60s coffin was
the arrival of the core i3 8100 which is
essentially a core i5 17 435 percent off
of course we still need affordable 300
series motherboards for it to be really
worth the investment that is the core i3
8100 but the writing certainly on the
wall I will say though for $64 us the G
4560 is still a good buy of course
you've just got a fire month for that
price if you stick it on a $50 h1 10
board you have a killer combo for a
smidgen over $100 considering you can't
even get a zine 370 board for that price
of a combo does still have merit
despite the lack of an upgrade path out
of stock out of stock and yep
out of stock there the words just about
every would-be core i7 87 arcade owner
has been faced with for the past month
it's certainly a frustrating situation
it means that while purchasing a d7 okay
has been next to impossible those that
have probably overpaid at the time of
making this video which was probably a
few days before it was actually released
the core i7 87 or okay was listed for
around 420 dollars u.s. the MSRP though
is of course thrown $60 u.s. so that's a
$60 u.s. price premium so right now the
core i7 8700 K is overpriced and out of
stock so why in the world is it on my
list of best cpu purchases in 2017 you
might ask well that's a pretty good
question I guess I'm just hoping that by
next month are these issues will be
corrected of course Intel is working on
bringing additional facilities online to
improve coffee-like supply so hopefully
we will see a result of that very
shortly so while the 87 okay hasn't
really been the best CPU purchase of
2017 yet unless you were lucky enough of
course to get one at the MSRP I'm hoping
that it will be a really good purchase
shortly supply issues aside there the
core i7 87 rotate is the best mainstream
desktop CPU in existence today
especially if you're a gamer seeking you
know no compromise type performance
there are five sixteen hundred or even
the horizon 7 1700 might be better value
options for those using it at mid-range
to high-end gaming hardware but for
those with something like a GeForce GTX
1080i seeking maximum frame rates the 87
era cake will deliver soon when it's in
stock
the best GPU purchases of 2017 I have to
admit having put the title for this
section of the video in word I kind of
just sat there staring at the screen for
like ten minutes I try to work out what
notes to make or what notes I could even
make had it been 2016 I might have said
something along the lines of like the
Radeon rx 470 was an exceptional sub
$200 us by while the RX for 80 offered
competitive mid-range performance with a
nice big 8 gigabyte frame buffer and
then talked about how the geforce gtx
1070 in 1080 offered unchallenged
high-end performance 2017 though well
despite AMD releasing far more products
this year I have to say overall it's
been less eventful at least in my
opinion the Radeon rx 500 series was
mostly a rebadged job in fact the
underwhelming rx 550 was the only truly
new GPU then we have Vega mega Vega Vega
probably don't need to go into that one
and too much detail again I feel like
Vega is still quite promising
but unfortunately like so many of AMD's
products that will likely become an
amazing secondhand deal in a few years
time Vega 56 is competitive and it
probably would have made this list had
custom boy partner cards been available
so with nothing from AMD really hitting
home for me this year it was again the
GeForce 10 series show and although the
geforce gtx 1070 and 1080 are
technically 2016 products they were
still some of the best buyers in 2017
the 1070 TI is another solid product
that offers strong value for ever
clockers though it's also a product that
we didn't really need for me the GP of
2017 was the mighty geforce gtx 1080 TI
it might cost $700 us and while we could
certainly sit around complaining about
GPU prices all day that doesn't change
the fact that it's a beast for the same
price Ami's radeon RX vega 64 liquid
can't hold a candle to the gtx 1080i in
almost every game out there Vega may end
up being the superior GPU and a few
use time we don't really know but what
we do know right now is the GTX 1080 Ti
is king so it was a bit of a washing
2017 I am near one out on the CPU front
can't still can't believe I'm saying
that but yeah it's my opinion they did
well in video one the GPU wore this year
quite convincingly had AMD been able to
mass-produce Vega earlier in the year
and enable board partner cards to be
created though I do recognize HBM to
supply is the issue here things might
have looked a bit different on the GPU
front likewise how do you tell me how to
ramp up supply their coffee like CPU
soon and of course offer motherboards
featuring their budget chipsets then
things on the CPU front would have
looked quite different as well anyway
that's going to do it for this one let
me know what your top cpu and GPU picks
of 2017 look like in the comment section

time guys
