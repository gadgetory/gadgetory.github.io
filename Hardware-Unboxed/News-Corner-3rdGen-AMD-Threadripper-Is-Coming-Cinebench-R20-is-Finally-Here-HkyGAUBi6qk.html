corner in the most important news of the
day I'm very happy to report that it's
not 40 degrees Celsius in here unlike
the last couple of weeks so it should be
a much more pleasant news corner the
first topic for this week is about
thread Ripper AMD has officially stated
that third-gen thread Ripper CPUs are on
track for release in 2019 at some point
after the launch of rise in desktop
processors considering AMD has released
new thread Ripper CPUs in August in both
2017 and 2018 it's probably not hard to
guess we'll be getting something similar
in 2019 but it is still nice that we're
getting official confirmation these
chips aren't delayed into next year
however amy hasn't shared any additional
information on what third gen thread
ripper might look like it's highly
likely the chips will be based on AMD
second gen epic design with seven
nanometers and two triplets but will we
be getting the full 64 core count of the
top-end SKUs will it top out at 32 cores
we just don't know at this stage
although certainly some epic features
will not make it to thread Ripper so aim
D doesn't cannibalize its server chip
sales as for other products we're
getting second gen rise and promo of our
AP users in spring which are expected to
be the same base chip as second gen
rising mo box I'll be using these n+
architecture and will be built on 12
nanometers then we have third gen rising
desktop processors coming mid-year
namely hasn't shed any new information
there when they first taste for Gen rise
and they also mentioned a media release
so again no real updates there there
have been a few rumors flying around
about exact dates for when AMD will
unveil and release these hotly
anticipated chips it's also been some
alleged pricing leaks at this stage
though we don't have any insights to
share in big news for the benchmarking
world and you know how much we love our
benchmarks here at Hardware boxed Maxon
has finally released a new version of
Cinebench one of the most popular
benchmarking tools for testing CPU
rendering performance
Cinebench has always been a benchmark
that shows how various CPUs would
perform in Maxson's cinema4d application
while rendering a typical scene sin
40 is a popular 3d modeling app used
across the industry so Cinebench has
sort of been this synthetic benchmark
tool that's neatly related to a
real-world app which makes it more
useful than just a straight synthetic
workload
the problem with Cinebench in recent
years is the ar-15 version of the
benchmark has lagged several versions
behind the latest version of the actual
cinema 4d app so it was getting outdated
and less useful as a benchmarking tool
even though most people still heavily
rely on it thankfully the new version of
Cinebench that's just been released
r20 brings the benchmark back up to
match the current release of cinema 4d
several changes have been made with
Cinebench R 20 it now renders an
entirely new scene that requires newer
AVX instructions through intel's Embree
technology which works on AMD and intel
processes and doesn't really appear to
be biased to either side it also now
scales beyond 64 threads which will come
in handy as cpus like thread ripper
pushed beyond that limit it also drops
the useless GPU benchmark to only focus
on CPU performance overall it should be
more reflective of how modern CPUs
should perform in modern rendering
workloads of course while Cinebench r20
is a nice tool it still shouldn't be
used as the sole comparison point
between CPUs it's always a good idea to
run a number of other benchmarks across
a range of workloads to get a better
idea of how CPU is stack up it isn't it
you can get a simple number out of the
benchmark this is just one tool in the
tool chest we also still recommend you
validate any overclocks on a longer
workload we use an hour long blender
test for example you can expect us to
begin using Cinebench our 24 future CPU
reviews so look out for those I guess
get ready for even more USB confusion as
this week the USB promoter group has
announced a new incoming specification
USB 4 thanks to Intel opening up their
Thunderbolt technology us before will be
based on Thunderbolt and essentially
absorb its feature set including
bandwidth up to 40 gigabits per second
power delivery and support for display
protocols the spec is set to be
finalized and published in the middle of
2019
although we do know it will use existing
USB type-c connectors and will maintain
backwards compatibility with both USB
2.0 USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt 3 which is
pretty neat a lot of the features that
have
been revealed so far make it sound like
this is just a USB version of
Thunderbolt 3 so we'll have to wait on
the final spec to see how it differs
usually it takes several years to go
from a final USB specification to the
first chips that support it so while it
looks that USB for will replace
Thunderbolt 3 it's probably still a few
years away NVIDIA has launched a new
game bundle for their geforce artex
graphics cards called our TX triple
threat it's not a bad deal to be honest
with some cards getting three games
bundled with the purchase battlefield 5
Metro Exodus and the highly
disappointing anthem all of these titles
use our TX functionality in some form
both battlefield 5 and Metro Exodus have
both ray-tracing and do SS while anthem
will get deal SS in an update soon those
who purchase either a geforce r-tx 20 80
TI or a 90 X 20 80 will get all three
games if you buy either an RT X 2070 or
our TX 2060 you get to choose one of the
three games meanwhile if you want to
truing gtx card like the gtx 1660 TI you
won't get anything at least those who
buy the 1662 i will be getting the best
value nvidia card anyway so not really a
huge loss there
the usual conditions apply here you have
to buy a card from a participating
retailer in select countries the
promotion lasts until April 4th and the
codes themselves must be redeemed before
May 2nd IOC has a new entry level 4k
gaming monitor called the G 2868 pqu
it's a 28 inch 4k TN panel with the 60
Hertz refresh rate and freesync although
not expecting to see LSC here as most 60
hertz monitors only have a minimum
refresh rate of 40 Hertz in fact 102
percent coverage of the srgb spectrum
82% of dobie RGB and it's advertised as
HD are ready
however it doesn't even meet display HDR
400 certifications
due to peak brightness of just 300 nits
so I think that probably tells you how
good of an HDR experience it will be
this mullet is set to go on sale this
month it's starting in the UK at 320
pounds this converts around 350 US
dollars which makes it a pretty
affordable 4k display even if it is only
TN dil has accidentally leaked the
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 16 60 TI to laptops
notebook check discovered that Dells
product page for a new g5 15
laptop.this said that some models come
with an ITX 2050 now that would be
interesting itself given there is no
r-tx 2015 at this stage but when they're
corrected it Dells still managed to give
out interesting information basically
they replaced the text RTX 2015 3 TX
1660 TI which means they've effectively
leaked the existence of a GTX 1660 TI
mobile chip NVIDIA has only announced
this GP for desktop cards at this point
although you think it will eventually
come to laptop sitting below the RT X
2060 there's no word on when it might be
available although I'm sure at some
point someone at BB getting a stern
talking-to final topic for this week
relates to Intel processors over the
last few weeks on news corner we've been
steadily updating you with details on
the rest of Intel's coffee Lake Refresh
lineup we've had lower end models leaked
one week KF models another week and team
models as well but there's no need for
that anymore because Fujitsu of all
people has revealed the entire night gen
desktop process of lineup before Intel
has managed to get around to it
now these chips will be super exciting
to enthusiasts desktop builders we know
you guys are more interested in stuff
like the 9900 K and 9700 K but this list
does indicate that Intel will add
another 32 CPUs to the current lineup
that officially includes just nine chips
at the moment this includes morals like
the i9 9900 ti3 9100 pentium gold g56 20
so on G 49 50 and even some Xeon a 2200
chips we only have basic information at
this point so core count and TD pay
which means we'll have to wait for Intel
to fill in the gap see seen the clock
speeds for the Cora 9 and 9900 teen
particular will be interesting given
it's listed as a 35 watt part the same
with the same 8 cores and 16 threads is
the power-hungry 99 K we also have to
wait and see for the full specification
list there's no real indication of when
Intel will provide that information
that's it for this week's news corner
