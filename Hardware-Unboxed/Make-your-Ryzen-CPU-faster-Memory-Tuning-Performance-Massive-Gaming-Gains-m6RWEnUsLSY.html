we're once again looking at second
generation rising performance but this
time with tweaked memory sub timings and
this is a benchmark that many of you
have been requesting over the past few
weeks so we've decided it's about time
we looked into it before we start tuning
our ddr4 memory though this video has
been sponsored by Squarespace whether
you need a domain website or online
store make up with Squarespace and for
more information please check the link
in the video description right so tuning
memory timings on the Rison platform
that's been a thing since AMD first
released there's an architecture roughly
at this time last year and we have seen
plenty of evidence that it really helps
gaming performance bumps those frame
rates up quite nicely but with memory
support for the first gen rising CPUs
already a bit sketchy we've often felt
those results were somewhat misleading
over the past year for example we have
had many dozen first generation rising
seven and rising five processes land on
our test bed and many of them have
struggled with ddr4 3,200 memory that
said though in the past 12 months memory
support has improved and I'd say that
most of those improvements have come via
the way of bias updates though we are
seeing more Verizon optimized ddr4
memory hit shelves as well it's also
important to note that a specific kind
of memory IC is required to support the
aggressively tuned memory timings
required to maximize Verizon's
performance so it's not something you
can achieve with old ddr4 memory for
this you will require modules featuring
Samsung's be de-iced ES and these only
come on certain eight gigabyte ddr4
memory modules this is premium memory
the best of the best so it's not cheap
and while no ddr4 memory is cheap right
now this stuff is particularly expensive
for example sixteen gigabyte ddr4 3,200
kits featuring two eight gigabyte
modules start at a hundred and seventy
dollars u.s. you can purchase G skills
tried and zf4 3200 C 16 D 16 GT z KW man
these things are worse than monitor
names you can get that kit for the 170
price tag however the Samsung B
diversion known as the f430 200 C 14 D
16 GT Z K Y which operates at much
tighter timings at cell 14 versus cell
16
that kit costs $200 u.s. so it's $30 us
more or an 18 percent increase in price
and while that might not sound like a
huge amount considering how expensive
memory already is tacking another $30 us
on certainly does hurt out of the box
the CL 14 memory allows for better
gaming performance and while it's
possible to tune certain timings for
better results with both memory types
you can it be far more aggressive with
the cell 14 Samsung video memory
circling back to what I mentioned
earlier one of horizons biggest issues
since release has been memory
compatibility and a try and combat that
AMD's had to sacrifice a lot of
performance by loosening timings to
improve compatibility for a wider range
of memory modules a touched on why
memory frequency and more importantly
latency impacts arises performance so
heavily in a recent video exploring IPC
performance if you missed that video in
short aim DS infinity fabric used to
connect these CCX modules is tied to the
memory clock rate so faster memory
reduces cortical latency when talking
between CX modules horizon 7 1800 X for
example features 2 c CX modules each
houses for cause those 4 cores within a
CC X module have a cortical latency of
about 40 nanoseconds and this latency
isn't influenced by memory speed however
cortical communication between CCX
modules is dramatically slower with ddr4
2400 memory you're looking at a delay of
about 140 nanoseconds that's around
three and a half times longer it is
possible to reduce that delay to about
110 nanoseconds with ddr4 3200 memory
and naturally it's reduced further
though with faster lower latency memory
so far we found the newer
second-generation rise in CPUs Packer
more robust to memory controller than
the first-generation Rison CPUs and
AMD's official spec also suggests that
this is indeed the case as the official
memory spec has increased from ddr4 2666
today
29:33 that said though you will require
a high-quality motherboard likely
featuring a six layer PCB to take
advantage of the higher frequency memory
initially through trial and error we
started shooting these sub timings on
the asrock x4 70 Taichi ultimate and we
were seeing some seriously good gains
during that testing though the ax soos
ROG crosshair 7 hero arrived and we put
the memory tuning on a hold to benchmark
the Rison 5 2600 using that of soos
motherboard during that testing I
stumbled upon the memory presets within
the dram timing control menu and here
asus has provided a number of profiles
for those using samsung b die memory the
best of these profiles were created by
finnish overclock at the stilt and here
we have 3233 33 and 34 66 configurations
having seen how well the stilts 3466
profile worked with my g.skill sniper x
ddr4 3400 memory this is what I decided
to test so the following benchmarks
feature the Rison 5 2600 overclock to
4.2 you goats using the standard extreme
memory profile for the g.skill flex ddr4
3200 memory then using the same memory
ivory tested twice using the stilts 3466
profile at 3400 and then once again with
the still to 3200 profile for comparison
i've thrown in my core i5 8600 count
8700 k results and post those CPUs are
running at 5.2 gigahertz along with the
7700 K at 5 gigahertz their eyes in 5
1604 gigahertz has also been included
along with the core i5 8400 which can't
be overclocked and therefore it isn't
all those processors were tested using G
skills flex ddr4 3200 cell 14 memory ok
let's get into the results first up we
have the sustained memory balance
performance and here the TWiT ddr4 3200
profile increase the memory bandwidth by
4 percent while the tweaked ddr4 32 400
configuration offered 10% more bandwidth
than the standard configuration for
applications that aren't really memory
balance sensitive or even memory latency
sensitive we see no impact at all the
Cinebench r15 single and multi-threaded
performance was basic
identical regardless of the memories
setup the video editing school was
increased ever so slightly here the tune
to 3200 memory improved performance by 3
percent while the ddr4 3,400 profile
offered a four percent performance jump
not really noteworthy gains but
performance is clearly improved beyond
the margin of error again we see pretty
minor gains this time in the PC Mar 10
gaming physics tests are not really much
worth noting here the tune
configurations were slightly faster but
really nothing to get excited about
basically no real gains were seen in the
accel test either a handbrake saw no
real performance gains the same could
also be said about the corona benchmark
then in blender the 2600 took just 27
seconds to complete the render time and
again memory timings and frequency had
no impact on performance finally the
last application benchmark is V array
and again nothing to see here so the
applications were a bit of a bust let's
move on to gaming well this is very
interesting here the overclocked Rison v
2600 went from a hundred and fifteen FPS
on average with the ddr4 3200 memory
using the standard extreme memory
profile to 120 FPS with the tweaked
timings that's a reasonable 4% increase
though we did see a 6% increase for the
one percent low result however it was
when we went from the tuned ddr4 3200
memory to the tuned ddr4 3400 memory
that we sway furthest 7 percent
performance boost and now the r5 2600 is
faster than 8,600 K clocked at five
point two gigahertz that's an incredibly
impressive result interestingly though
we see no real gains when testing with
Assassin's Creed origins and this title
always provides odd results even with
the higher quality preset used to reduce
the GPU bottleneck this doesn't do much
to help the Rison v 2600 out and while
we do often see strange results with
Assassin's Creed origins so this just
seems to be another one of those strange
results
moving on to battlefield one though we
do find when using the ultra quality
settings at the r5 2600 with the tuned
ddr4 3400 memory can find the limits of
the gtx 1080i at least as far as the
average framerate is concerned it's
still six percent slower than the ad 600
k for the one percent low result and
eight percent slower than 87
okay perhaps more notable is the fact
that the 2,600 1% low performance was
increased by 13%
when using the faster memory the gain
seen in far cry 5 are a little less
impressive but even so the tweaked ddr4
3400 memory configuration did allow the
r5 2600 to match the core i5 8400 so
certainly not a bad result there finally
we looked at gaming performance with
vermintide 2 and here the tweaked ddr4
3200 configuration offered a 7% increase
in performance while we saw a 10% jump
when using the tune ddr4 3400 memory
despite those gains though the 2600 was
still 7% slower than the 80 600 K and
11% slower than the air.you 700k though
again keep in mind those CPUs are
running at 5.2 gigahertz which is about
4 percent higher than what most chips
will achieve ok so some very interesting
results there but please note this is
just a very small sample of the gaming
tests that we have to come so consider
those benchmarks are somewhat of a
preview because soon we will have
finished our head-to-head comparison
between the Rosen 520 600 and core i5
8400 in over 30 games for those of you
wondering the Rison 5 process that will
be tested and its stock out of the box
trim and that means using ddr4 29:33
memory and we will also be including a
4.2 gigahertz all core overclock using
the tweaked ddr4 3400 profile so it
should be interesting and then the core
i5 8400 that will be tested using the
stock ddr4 2666 memory on a B 360
motherboard what we've seen here there
are some seriously good gains in a
number of games the results seen when
testing with battlefield 1 vermintide to
an ash of the singularity in particular
were very impressive while far cry 5 was
also quite good we were still quite
limited in Assassin's Creed origins
though this title has always been a bit
strange with rising CPUs for
applications though the aggressive
memory timings have next to no impact on
performance and for the most part the
memory and Core latency doesn't really
impact these types of workloads the
loose sub memory timing center really
only impact gaming performance and
tighten them up as we've done in this
test really improves things for Rison
unfortunately though I should note that
this isn't something ever
one can do as you will require expensive
B died memory and as such you won't be
able to achieve these results with a
lesser memory this does make testing
exclusively with manually configured
memory timings very misleading in my
opinion it is something we'll start to
include when overclocking horizon but
those results really need to be coupled
with a stock memory profile as well as
good as it is seeing rise in achieving
such impressive performance boosts in
games let's not get to carrying out
these results the most affordable
Samsung BD modules that I'm aware of
retail for about $200 u.s. and that is
for 16 gigabyte kit and the Intel
processors can achieve performance shown
in this video with 160 dollar US memory
so that is a $40 u.s. saving for the
Intel processors if you're going to be
realistic about this you have to take
that cost into consideration the core i5
8400 Kross $180 u.s. 16 gigabytes of
memory is 160 dollars u.s. and it can
get a decent B 360 motherboard for $80
u.s. so all up 420 dollars u.s. for that
platform the horizon 520 600 costs $200
u.s. then the memories $200 us and
assuming you can get the most out of
this memory on a be 350 motherboard then
it's $80 for the motherboard the horizon
build now costs at least $6 u.s. more
which admittedly isn't a lot but the big
draw card for AMD has been the fact that
you do get more stuff for less money oh
and I almost forgot you will want to
throw an additional $20 at the build for
a decent tower style air cooler if you
want to hit that 4.2 here it's
overclocked and achieve the same level
of performance shown in this video it's
also worth noting that the core i5 8400
and rise and 520 600 at 4.2 gigahertz
they did still trade blows in the game
benchmarks so it's not like arising just
brushes the core i5 aside with the
faster more expensive memory but if
