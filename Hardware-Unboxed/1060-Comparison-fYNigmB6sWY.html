good wherever you are today I'm back at
it again with another video RAM
comparison just two weeks ago and video
launched a 3 gigabyte version of the GTX
1060 and in the process confuse us all
the reduced memory capacity isn't
particularly confusing rather it's the
change in core configuration that has
many more than a little baffled
despite being built upon the same GP 106
architecture is the full-fat gtx 1066
gigabyte the new 3 gigabyte model has an
SM unit disabled this takes the total
cuda coil count from 1280 down to 1152 a
10% reduction as a result there are also
10 percent fewer texture mapping units
as well although the memory capacity is
being reduced the memory subsystem
remains much the same using gddr5 memory
clocked at 2,000 megahertz for a
bandwidth of 192 gig so despite
physically changing the core
configuration the name remains exactly
the same of course and video has done
this in the past way back in 2006 they
released the 8800 GT s with 640
megabytes of VRAM only to release the
320 megabyte version with the same name
the following year which was then
followed by a 512 megabyte version again
with the same name in my opinion the 3
gigabyte gtx 1060 should be known as the
1060 GS or perhaps even the gtx 1050 TI
anyway it's not so it's important to
understand what the difference between
the two gtx 1060 models is other than
the downgraded specifications just
mentioned the other change has to do
with the price there is of course some
good news here is the 3 gigabyte model
features an MSRP of just $200 placing it
head-to-head with the 4 gigabyte RX 480
that is if you're able to find AMD's new
mid-range contender according to Nvidia
the cut down 3 gigabyte model should
only be about 5 percent slower given its
losing just 10% of a shader texture and
geometry capacity with none of the
rasterization capacity this doesn't seem
unrealistic that said this has been
something I've been wanting to test for
myself and finally I have that chance
the biggest question mark regarding
performance is that limited 3 gigabyte
memory capacity for a GPU capable of
delivering gtx 980 light performance we
wonder how much of a handicap this
limited memory buffer will be
therefore we'll be comparing the three
gigabyte and 6q by models of the default
nvidia clock speeds which sees both
models running a base clock of 1506
megahertz with the boost clock of 1708
megahertz benchmarking takes place at
1440p and most games have been tested
using the maximum in-game quality
settings given the three gigabyte model
features ten percent less cause we'll be
looking out for margins greater than
this when analyzing the impact the
memory buffer has on performance once
again my standard core i7 benchmark rig
has been used for testing and this will
help to eliminate any potential system
bottlenecks that could shape the results
as we found in the past The Witcher 3
isn't a big vram user and in our tests
we only saw up to two point three
gigabytes allocated this meant the three
gigabyte model wasn't disadvantaged by
its memory capacity impressively it was
just four percent slower than the fully
fledged six gigabyte model the
performance of the GTX 1063 gigabyte was
on par with the Radeon RX 4 ad overwatch
is another game that isn't a heavy VM
user and as a result the three gigabyte
1060 is just 6 percent slower when
comparing the average frame rate for
those of you looking to spend most of
your time playing games such as
overwatch the 3 gigabyte model will be
the most cost-effective option it seems
Grand Theft Auto was benchmarked with
the advanced graphics option disabled
along with MS a.m. still everything else
was maxed out and this push memory usage
as high as 2.9 gigabytes which obviously
wasn't an issue for the 3G by 1060 once
again the three gigabyte model was just
6 percent slower memory allocation in
Deus Ex mankind divided crept just to
our three gigabytes to reach 3.1
gigabytes
despite that 3 gig 1060 hung in there
this time it was 8% slower on average
while the frame time performance didn't
suffer star wars battlefront consumed
after three and a half gigabytes of vram
in our tests and again despite that the
frame time performance of the three
gigabyte 1060 didn't suffer this time
the three gig model was an average just
seven percent slower we know doom kills
graphics cards with less than two
gigabytes of vram but it seems three gig
is enough here the three gigabyte 1060
was just 4% slower than the six gig
model when running the game in OpenGL
switching the Volcom provided similar
margins between the two 1060 graphics
cards that said the three gig model is
now 6 percent slower memory allocation
maxed out at 3.7 gigabytes in the
division but again this didn't appear to
have a negative impact
the 3G 1060 and it's limited vram
capacity the 3 gigabyte model was to 7%
slower on average while the frame time
data looked good to benchmarking with
Batman Arkham Knight soar memory
allocation creep up to 4.1 gigabytes and
this did sites we impact the 3G 1060 in
a negative way although it was on
average just 9% slower it took a serious
nosedive in the frame time results the
1% time results saw the 3 gig bundle
trail by 17 percent and then 19% for the
0.1% time result the game was noticeably
smoother on the 6-ski 1060 but it has to
be said the experience on the 3 gig
model was still very good first we
tested Far Cry primal with the high
quality settings though please note the
HD texture pack was also installed and
enabled as a result the game allocated
up to 4 Giga vram in our tests oddly
this didn't appear to impact the frame
time performance of the 3d 1060 though
it was 9% slower for the average frame
rate now with the ultra quality preset
enabled the average frame rate is just
7% lower for the 3G 1060 the frame time
data is weaker now but not to the degree
where stuttering became an issue the
three gigabyte 1060 was 8% slower than
the 6 gigabyte model when comparing the
average frame rate while it was just 6%
slower for the 1% time data testing
Assassin's Creed syndicate using the
high quality preset never saw memory
allocation exceed 3 point 4 gigabytes
increasing the image quality preset to
very high boosted memory allocation to
4.3 gigabytes but this didn't appear to
have a noticeable impact on the 3G 1060
it still trailed the 6 gigabyte model by
an 8% margin Mirror's Edge catalyst is
another memory hungry game though
despite seeing memory allocation rise as
high as 4 point 5 gigabytes the three
gigabyte 1060 was only over 6 percent
slower
increasing the quality to high power we
see a massive decline in performance of
the 3G 1060 as memory allocation climbs
to 5.1 gigabytes the three gigabyte
model is now 41 percent slower than the
fully fledged 6 q by 1060 and with an
average frame rate of 22 fps the game is
clearly unplayable middle-earth
shadow of Mordor is odd in the sense
that we see a huge amount of allocation
with very little impact on performance
the three gigabyte 1060 was just 8%
slower than the six gigabyte model
despite memory allocation reaching five
point four gigabytes finally we have
rise of the Tomb Raider and here memory
allocation hits an insane
7.7 gigabytes naturally you'd expect
that to completely cripple the three
gigabyte n60 but that wasn't really the
case the three gigabyte model was 10%
slower but given the conditions and the
difference in core configuration that's
a very respectable result for the
cut-down gtx 1060 graphics card Nvidia
claimed that the three gigabyte gtx 1060
will be 5% slower than the six gigabyte
model and for the most part that's
pretty accurate
if we exclude the hyper quality Mirror's
Edge catalyst test the three gigabyte
model was an average seven percent
slower in the 13 games tested adding in
the massive deficit seen in Mirror's
Edge catalyst pushes the margin out to
9% I have to admit I found these results
a little surprising personally I was
expecting a three gigabyte model to
struggle a little more or 1440p
especially with such high quality
settings in play with the exception of
two games the three gigabyte 1060
performed admirably the Mirror's Edge
catalyst hyper test is almost irrelevant
given there's almost no difference in
image quality between hyper and ultra
settings dropping the standing back to
Ultra saw the three gigabyte 1060 become
very competitive and even match the
frame time performance of the bigger six
cubic model the only other game to
present an issue was Batman Arkham
Knight and while the three gigabyte 1060
did deliver perfectly playable
performance here the frame time results
did fall away a bit beyond that the
three gigabyte 1060 was around 6 to 8
percent slower and virtually every title
tested making an exceptional value given
it cost 20% less those of you looking
for an affordable graphics card for
1440p gaming shouldn't dismiss the three
gigabyte 1060 I can't say with any
degree of certainty how this card will
look compared to the six gigabyte model
in a year's time however right now based
on the evidence at hand there's very
little difference between the two for
1080p gamers the choice seems more
obvious save the money and get a three
gigabyte model
I can't imagine even in a year's time
that 3 gigabyte 1060 will suffer at this
res as a side note once the GTX 1063
gigabyte and rx 484 gigabyte graphics
cards are readily available the $200
MSRP we're going to have a real battle
on our hands looking through the data
the two certainly trailer blows and
overall delivered very similar
performance what did you guys think of
these results are you considering the
three gigabyte 1060 let me know in the
