gaming system but don't want to go
overboard then you're probably eyeing
off AMD and Intel Slater sub $200
processes the new FX 8320 is almost too
cheap to refuse adjust 130 dollars that
the much newer and more efficient
skylake processors should have your
second guessing earlier this year I felt
something like the core i5 6400 was a
no-brainer as it was possible to
overclock by more than sixty percent on
motherboard supporting 9k overclocking
and the resulting performance was
extremely impressive intel has since
shut the door and non case kike
overclocking and unless you have a
supporting Zed 170 motherboard and were
able to acquire the OC BIOS then the
base clock simply won't be possible as
attractive as the overclockable cry 5
6400 was without the ability overclocked
i'll recommend ignoring this processor
the 6500 is clock nineteen percent
higher at 3.2 gigahertz opposed to the
2.7 gigahertz operating frequency to
6400 and yet it cost us five percent
more with such a massive price
difference between the 130 dollar FX
8320 and the two-hundred-dollar core i5
6500 is it worth buying the intel
processor if you're a gamer in an effort
to discover which system is the best
i've decided to build both and by that i
don't just mean I'm going to throw the
core hardware on the test bench and be
done with it and what's going to be a
four-part video we'll be covering the
build and the benchmarking but first I'm
going to do something a little different
something I've never done before
obviously case modding is nothing new
diehard PC enthusiasts have been doing
it for decades now over the years I
myself have gotten busy with the dremel
on the odd occasion installed case
windows create a custom fan mounting and
well had fun making a mess while I'd
never proclaimed to be a PC model it is
something I'll try my hand at every now
and then with varied results something
I've never attempted is to paint a
computer case I always take the easy way
out and just buy one in the color I want
like my bitfenix Aegis blue for these
builds I'm gonna have a go at a little
painting so this should be interesting
we have had time to do a bit of research
so hopefully the project won't end in a
disaster that's said I really must dress
this first part of my build guide
ironically isn't actually a guide I'm
definitely not here to try and teach you
how to paint not yet anyway my victims
are a pair of Silverstone khoob like a
low five cases and by the end of this
video expect the warranties to be very
much null and void as this going to be
an AMD FX and an Intel Core i5 system
I'll be doing the obvious by painting
one red and the other blue apart from
the computer cases I have with me a
canvas drop sheet hopefully you can
handle what I'll be throwing at it i
also have a dozen spray cans which
should be more than i need with an
emphasis on should be the first step is
to strip the case down to individual
parts that you want to paint for the
intel system this included pretty much
everything as i plan on the light blue
exterior with a white interior so i
ended up with a heap of individual paths
for the AMD build i'm sticking with the
standard red and black colour scheme so
only the external parts will be painted
red for painting the plastics and metals
you require a self-etching primer and
then a top coat in the color of your
choosing there are individual primers
for plastics and metals so make sure you
get the right ones for the primer it's
best lay it on pretty thick but you of
course need to do so while avoiding any
runs or drips so make sure you smooth
strokes and evenly work your way around
the project allows the fish and dry time
for the primer if you want a really nice
smooth and clean looking finish be sure
to use some 600 grit sandpaper before
painting the topcoat you just want to
gently remove any high points in the
primer these will spoil the finished
product now it's time to add a little
color this time you want to do lighter
coats but remember to keep a smooth
action and apply the paint evenly you'll
probably find it necessary to work at a
range of different angles to ensure all
surfaces receive even coverage typically
you'll want to apply at least two top
coats but if you can manage it i
recommend three if you're serious about
achieving a professional-looking finish
you want to lightly sand between each
coat the sanding the top coat you'll
want 1000 grit paper I'm just going to
dry sand it but if you find us is
clogging up the paper then it might be
better to wet sand just make sure you
have wet and dry paper now you won't
want to sand the final top coat as this
will have course scratch and scuff it so
to ensure a perfect finish make sure the
coats prior are nice and smooth at this
point you could airbrush your design
onto the case if that kind of thing is
within your skill set or alternatively
or something on for this build I'm not
gonna be doing either of those things
instead I'm just going with a solid red
and a solid blue case now the final
color code is on I'm going to protect it
with a clear coat which will of course
give a nice glossy finish after leaving
all the parts to dry the paint will
harden to the point where it's
surprisingly durable that's at this
point you can reassemble the case in
preparation for the build to come
providing you remember how you took it
apart rebuilding the case is a fairly
quick process the Silverstone klo 5 took
just a few minutes to reassemble
I'm quite happy with the finished
products and I can't wait to build a
pair of gaming rigs valued at around a
thousand dollars each be sure to check
back soon for the individual build logs
for the Intel and AMD system which will
be followed by a solid benchmark session</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
