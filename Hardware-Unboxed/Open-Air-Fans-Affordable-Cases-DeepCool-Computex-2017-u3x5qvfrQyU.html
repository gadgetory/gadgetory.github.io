Computex coverage today we're over at
the deep cool booth and we're here to
check out a range of new PC cases and
some of them should be quite affordable
there's also a few other bits and pieces
as well so let's get into it before we
do though just a quick thank you to MSI
for bringing you see the issue really
appreciate that and it's been great
to check out all the cool gear at
Computex if you guys are in the market
for new gaming desktop PC then check out
msi high-end core i7 systems they are
very impressive and I have a video on
them soon and they're offering a free
you play game key for Tom Clancy's Ghost
Recon wildlands with select purchases
they're also offering a wildland game
key with select MSI motherboards so
check out their x99 zed 270 and h2 70
range I'll provide the link in the video
description all right so onto the deep
cool stuff they put together a really
nice looking booth it was very clean and
simple the focus for Computex 2017 was
primarily on their new PC cases first up
we have the baron case of liquid and
this model will be available in two
color schemes black with red highlights
or white with silver accents what's
interesting about this case is that it's
very small and I know small cases aren't
anything new but this one is
particularly interesting because it
supports full-size ATX motherboards
looking at the case externally you
certainly wouldn't think that it's
really no bigger than your typical micro
ATX case so you can expect that there's
no wasted space inside especially
considering that the captain 120 X
all-in-one liquid coolers come as
standard with a cool looking flow meter
attachment as well so it's a really nice
package there the case and cooler
feature RGB lighting so I'm sure that
won't surprise to many of you at this
point it's pretty much being
accomplished next 2017 RGB edition but I
have to say it does provide a very
awesome effect as it all ties in really
well with the flow meter and water block
so yeah a very smart looking case for
those who want to show off their
Hardware in fact the RGB goodness
doesn't stop there
even the SSD shroud is RGB lit along
with a vertically orientated 2.5 inch
drive bay and if that's not enough
also thrown in an LED light strip for
good measure
despite its micro-atx stature the
bearing case can handle a 240 millimeter
radiator in the front and a 280
millimeter radiator on the top and if
you want you could install a 120
millimeter radiator in the rear as well
if you wanted to just fill the case with
radiators if for some reason though you
were using an air cooler I guess this
would be more likely if you've got the
non liquid cooled version of the case
the cooler can stand as tall as 175
millimeters speaking of clearance
there's also room for PS use as long as
200 millimeters so that's obviously
ample room for the fully featured liquid
cooled version we are expecting a price
point of about $130 u.s. and the case
should hit shelves later next month
moving on we have the L case RGB yet
another flashy computer case I think you
guys will appreciate this one as it
costs just $1 u.s. obviously that makes
it by no means a budget case $80 us is
still quite a bit for a case but I think
you'll agree at the price point there is
quite a lot on offer here internally
it's very well laid out and I really
like how deep cool has included a
separate basement section for the power
supply and all those messy cables out of
the box the case includes an RGB light
strip so that's very cool you can show
off all your hardware actually with that
large acrylic side window you will
really be able to show off all your
hardware and to keep it all cool there
is support for a 280 millimeter radiator
in the top of the unit and you could add
an extra three hundred and sixty
millimeter or 280 millimeter radiator in
the front next up we have the do case or
liquid and this model is similar to the
bearing case it just takes everything
pretty much to the next level included
this time is a 240 millimeter radiator
so yes you do get that out of the box so
radiator water block the whole lot
included in the case that's very cool
and pre-installed attached to the
all-in-one liquid cooler is a flow meter
and this one has not one but two
rotators I have to say it does look very
cool as I mentioned earlier there is a
large acrylic window included and this
does show off all the cool hardware
inside very well what I really like
though deep pool has once again gone
with a basement style design to hide the
PSU and all the messy cables so they
won't be seen through the nice
Fillie panel the jewel-case liquid also
includes a fan controller in the form of
a dial so it's fairly simple but it does
work well and that can control up to
three fans at the same time the case
will be available later this month for
$190 us so keen to check it out but I
think for what you get that's a pretty
good price especially given that there's
a 240 millimeter radiator included in
the case and of course you get the
waterblock and the flow meter the last
case on display was this monster the new
arc 90 a generously sized case capable
of supporting extended ATX motherboards
this time around not just the left side
panel features are acrylic window but so
too does the top and right panels as
well so it's kind of a transparent PC
Ala box this model also comes with a
liquid cooler this time we find the 280
e ex model with the same fancy dual flow
rotators so again very cool padding out
this model are three pre installs 140
millimeter fans of course the fans are
RGB lit so we get you know integrated
RGB lighting again and the RGB lighting
extends to the flow meter
the captain water block the PSU shroud
the included LED strip of course
so yeah plenty of lighting on offer it
also comes with a PCIe riser cable
included so that's another nice
inclusion and this means you can
showcase your graphics card facing
towards the side window and they had an
Nvidia reference card on display and
yeah it looked really cool
as far as radio support goes the our
community can handle up to a three
hundred and sixty millimeter radio in
both the top and rear of the case
unfortunately at this point pricing for
this particular model isn't known but
they are telling me that it will become
available in October later this year
moving up from the cases I found one
other products that instantly caught my
attention and that's the crazy new MF
120 GT fans these very unique looking
fans are what deep cool used to
highlight their brand name at the booth
it's a very impressive display and you
guys will have seen on the b-roll these
new RGB fans feature advanced vibration
dampening thanks to a specially designed
aluminium mounting structure I guess you
could say this is an open-air fan design
can't say I've seen a PC with fans but
look anything like this before
they were very unique I
just hope they turn out to be relatively
practical still helping with the
practicality side of things they do have
vibration dampening pads and the
aluminium frame does the touch for easy
cleaning so they could turn out to be
quite easy to live with illumination is
provided sorry I should say RGB
illumination is provided by a very cool
looking translucent strip that runs
either side of the aluminium frame deep
cool cool this their double v-shape RGB
lighting system the marketing team were
also quite busy with the fans themselves
come out with what deep cool calls their
double layer blades when stationary
these do look great and when active
they're said to increase air pressure
using the supplied controller which
comes in a three pack or which comes
with a three pack of fans I should say
for $100 us which is expensive but quite
reasonable we've grown to or come to
expect I should say spending about a
hundred dollars us on a three pack of
LED fans that do have a digital
controller anyway the controller will
allow you select a fan speed between 500
rpm and 2200 rpm so they can be quite
quiet or reasonably loud or at least
move a hell of a lot of air at 2200 rpm
overall some very cool and flashy
looking highway was on display at the
deep cool booth this year and it was
great to check out their upcoming cases
I'm particularly keen to check out the
$80.00 case the RGB model of course once
it lands any way that's going to do it
for the deep cool booth I'm your host
Steve hope you guys enjoyed the coverage
I'll catch again soon
