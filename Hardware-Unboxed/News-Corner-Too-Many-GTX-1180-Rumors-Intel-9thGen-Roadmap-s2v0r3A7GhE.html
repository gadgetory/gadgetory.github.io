corner today's video is gonna hopefully
be a bit of a shorter one as I reckon
I'm getting a cold which is just
fantastic and most of the topics from
this week are more rumours than anything
else but before I get into the news
though a quick reminder for those that
are supporters of us through patreon
we've recently uploaded a number of
behind-the-scenes videos with more to
come
the latest one involves Steve teasing a
certain AMD launched along with a short
tour of his studio so check the links
out that in the description below all
right on with the news in this first one
is brief straightforward nvidia is
hosting an event at Gamescom on August
20th titled GeForce gaming a celebration
invidious description of the event
suggest there will be new exclusive
hands-on demos of the hottest upcoming
games stage presentations from the
world's biggest game developers and some
spectacular surprises at this point
you'd think in video will definitely be
launching new GeForce graphics cards at
this event but of course we don't know
for sure but surely this is the case
however as always temperature
expectation is because Nvidia could very
well not launch new cards and it
certainly wouldn't be the first time
they have teased events at various
conferences only to rock up without any
new GPU news but with everything
everyone has been hearing for months now
it sounds like this one will be the real
deal
speaking of new Nvidia cards a photo of
a new NVIDIA PCB emerged this week
through Baidu video cards are suggesting
this is for the gtx 2080 though it could
be named the gtx 1180 who knows and of
course the PCB could actually be for
something else entirely like a Quadro
card but it does at least look like a
legitimate PCB for an upcoming
unannounced product interesting things
to note here is the lack of an SLI
connector instead there's an NV link
type connector at the top which matches
up with rumors suggesting and videos
moving to NV link for new gaming
products there's also a relatively small
pin area for the GPU and the cards power
design includes a 10 phase of erm with a
6 + 8 pin power connectors which is an
increase on the GTX 1080 that use just
an 8 pin connector will be interesting
to see if this is the real deal come the
official launch of invidious next-gen
GPUs may as well get all the next-gen G
force room is out of the way now this
one is a leak showing manly technologies
and in the video GPU vendor registered
an ECC certificate on July 20th that
includes the words GA 104 and GA 104 -
400 in the listing along with many other
GPU names like GF 104 GP 104 and so
forth this is either a placeholder for
the real names of these upcoming GPUs or
next gen geforce cards are using GA 100
series GPUs possibly referring to the
codename amp√®re rather than cheering
both code names have appeared during
this rumour cycle with cheering the more
recent of the two as of right now the
references to GA 104 are still up in the
listing what has been modified our
references to the gtx 2080 and gtx 2070
that appeared in a separate listing
these were probably typos anyway as the
list includes the gtx 1050 and the gtx
1060 but not the gtx 1070 and gtx 10a
first thing as of right now has removed
not just that 2080 and 2070 references
but the rest of the 10 series as well
except for the GT 1030 I've seen this
room would pop up in a lot of places but
I wouldn't be taking this as a
confirmation of what the new GPUs will
be called those are still up in the air
at the moment as soos has accidentally
published a list of motherboards that
use the Zen 390 chipset which Intel
still hasn't officially announced the
list appears to be basically a Souza's
entire lineup spanning 19 products five
product lines and three separate form
factors I'm not going to read out every
name because that would be painfully
boring but essentially there are six ROG
Maximus boards for ROG Strix boards
including a mini ITX offering five
boards in the tough line three in the
prime line and a single dragon board
exclusive to China only the tough and
prime lines include micro ATX ports
nothing super surprising here just a
standard refresh from
said 370 to Z 390 msi has confirmed
through a news post that there's at 370
boards will support Intel's upcoming and
yet to be officially announced 9000
series CPUs through a BIOS update the
post doesn't say what ninth gen CPUs
will be supported so it's still unclear
whether said 370 will support everything
including the eight core chips or just
the core i5 line and below which are
basically three brands of existing 8th
gen
cpu's still if you have a said 370 board
it looks like you'll be able to slot you
in at least some ninth gen without
upgrading the entire platform electrode
map has suggested Intel will launch
their new coffee lake s processes in
both six core and a covariance in
October specifically we'll be getting
the i9 9900 ki7 9700 K&amp;amp;I v 9600 k then
with more chips scheduled for q1 of 2019
the roadmap also suggests we'll get a
basement vault refresh in October in
other words we'll be getting new h EDT
chips from intel although it only listed
up to an 18 core process or 165 watts
rather than they're supposed 28
Courtship Intel discussed at Computex
this roadmap and document looks exactly
like some of the official documents we
know Intel ships to the OEM so it's
either a very good fake or it is
illegitimate and I reckon this one is
bang on the money DG x claims the DRAM
industry will be over supplied in 2019
citing industry sources as always the
unreliable website suggests capacity
increases at micron and improvements
that Samsung and SK Hynix as well will
lead to more memory on the market this
should result in lower prices stay
predicted way back in January that
memory prices would come down in 2019 so
I hope for his ego that the report is
complete crap so he doesn't come and
gloat about it in that discord or Skype
chats and I know you messaged me about
this pi the news corner when you watch
it steam I know you watch these things
right till the end final news topic of
the week Logitech has acquired Blue
Microphones who make some quality
podcasting star microphones like the
Yeti and snowball where you've probably
seen streamers use of them and we've got
a few as well the deal was done for 117
million dollars in cash and will
strengthen logitech's peripheral lineup
that's it for this week's news corner

coming days subscribe if you want this
