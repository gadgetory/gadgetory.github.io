you're building on your computer
upgrading an old one and access D should
be at the top of your list
for budget builds or upgrading an older
system this means getting something like
crucial MX 300 I start a drive that
offers extreme snappiness at a
reasonable price those building a more
extreme desktop system will no doubt be
aiming for something more like an nvme
SSD the PCI Express bus provides so much
more bandwidth furnishing these
high-speed storage devices not all nvme
drives are created equally though we saw
this last year we checked out Intel's
rather hopeless SSD 600 P model was
plagued by poor sustained write
performance which would see it drop
below hard drive light performance
before too long at the complete opposite
end of the spectrum we have the samsung
SSD 960 series which pretty much set the
bar in terms of price and performance
today nothing can compete with the 960
Pro Series and the 2 terabyte version
has been my weapon of choice for more
than half a year now the 960 Evo series
is extremely good but I feel like if
you're going to spend this much money on
a high-speed SSD you might as well
ensure that it uses mlc nand and not the
slightly less reliable TLC stuff since
the release of samsung's 960 series back
in October of 2016
numerous challenges have stepped forward
and an effort to try and snatch the
performance crown from the Korean
companies grasp so far not have been
able to do so one such company was
Corsair with their 4 series MP 500 and I
checked out the 480 gigabyte model back
in January
in short the MP 500 was a great
all-rounder boasting decent performance
and a high endurance rating the downside
being that in terms of pricing it simply
couldn't compete at $325 u.s. it matched
the 512 gigabyte 960 pro and given it
was quite a bit smaller
this made courses nvme SSD a tough sell
today pricing has improved in the MP 500
series is far more competitive the
flagship for 80 gigabyte model for
example cost just 53 cents per gigabyte
at 255 dollars whereas the 960 pro 5
gigabyte comes in at a slightly higher
58 cents per gigabyte as it can now be
had for $300 u.s. the MP 500
advantage of fire zones pcie 3.0 times
for nvme SSD controller dubbed PS v w7 -
e 7 along with 2 Sheba's 15 nanometer
mlc nand a number of other brands have
released their own versions such as
patriot with their hellfire m2 and P&amp;amp;Y
released a catchy sounding CS 2030 more
recently in mid-march so Tech came out
with this Sonics which also duns the
fising controller and Toshiba
mlc memory however they opted for a
half-height 1/2 link PCI Express 3.0
times for form factor rather than much
more compact m2 form factor it was
expected that other brands such as
Corsair Patriot musk and PMI and
Kingston for example would soon offer
similar products so it comes with a
little surprised that Corsair has just
released HHH L that is of course a half
flight half length PCI Express 3.0 times
for SSD once again using the files in PS
5 double-oh-seven
- a7 controller and 15 nanometer Toshiba
mlc memory so is this just an MP 500 on
a PCIe adapter card or is it something
more well thankfully it is a little more
than that this is an attempt to drive
mounted on an adapter card that's the
kind of thing we often see from Kingston
rather the components are directly
mounted to the PCB and this comes with a
few advantages that will touch on
shortly for now let's talk specs the
nutrient series nx500 comes either 400
or 800 gigabyte capacities and of course
the form factor is h HL meanwhile the MP
500 series offers 120 gigabyte 240 bite
and 480 gigabyte capacities using the m2
2280 form factor both use the same pcie
3.0 x 4 interface files and controller
and 15 nanometer mlc nand flash memory
the DRAM cache capacity has been
upgraded previously the 480 gigabyte MP
500 sported a 512 megabyte cache the
nx500 400 gigabyte has been upgraded
with a one gigabyte cache while the
eight hundred gigabyte model gets a much
larger 2 gigabyte cache and both still
make use of ddr3 memory here as you
might expect the quoted sequential read
and write speeds are the same three
gigabytes read coupled with a 2.4
gigabytes per second write
the random reading right IELTS
performance has been improved by between
20 and 30 percent and the nx500 series
offers up to 300,000 I ops when reading
and 270,000 when writing meanwhile the
insurance rating remains the same as
does the power consumption that said the
larger 800 gigabyte model comes with an
impressive endurance rating of thirteen
hundred and ninety six terabytes written
finally the warranty period has been
upgraded from three years to a much more
competitive five years so that's great
to see so at this point you might be
wondering what's new here frankly in
terms of specifications as you've just
seen nothing really other than the form
factor but that is kind of a big deal
although the MTU form factor is all the
rage now and support is as strong as
it's ever been those new X 299 boards
for example take advantage of multiple
drives and the upcoming X 399 boards are
set to do the same however this small
compact form factor while very
impressive is brutal on the component
heat is the main issue here and getting
rid of it is the problem with no room
for adequate cooling keeping the
controller cool is a real challenge and
it's something most m2 drives fail to do
making them unsuitable for sustained
throughput the Samsung SSD 960 Evo which
I have on hand for example goes from an
idle temperature of around 30 degrees to
over 60 degrees within a minute of
sustained data transfer and at this
point the write performance is throttled
back quite heavily that said the
throttling doesn't help with the
temperatures in check and you know 100
gigabyte transfer test temps peak at 90
degrees so while it's possible to write
around 20 gigabytes of data at over 1.5
gigabytes per second going beyond that
reduces the throughput to around a third
of the original performance
unfortunately I don't have the MP 500
drive on hand for comparison currently
Tim is using that in his Rison 7 editing
rig so the samsung SSD 960 Evo will have
to do moving to the NX 500 we started
the 100 gigabyte transfer test with a
drive temper 34 degrees pretty much what
we saw from the Evo however by the end
of the test that's the right Android
test the drive temp never exceeded 49
degrees and we never saw any kind of
throttling so for sustained writes over
20 gigabytes in size the nx500 was
actually more than twice as fast as the
960 Evo and it can expect to be quicker
than 960 pro as well
granted it's unlikely most of you will
often move more than say 20 gigabytes
worth of data and one hit but when you
do the nx500 will perform much better
the reason the x500 works so much better
is down to the fact that that huge chunk
of aluminium strapped onto the front
side of the PCB is connected to the
surface of the files and controller
using a thermal pad so while you will
have to sacrifice a PCI Express
expansion slot you do so on the
knowledge of knowing you'll be getting
the maximum performance under all
conditions all right let's jump into the
benchmarks for a few more quick tests
first up I checked out the sequential
read and write performance in the a SSD
benchmark and here the nx500 provided
very similar results to the MP 500 as
expected corsair claims the same
sequential performance of both the 400
gigabyte and x 500 and 480 gigabyte MP
500 moving on the 4k 64 thread
performance was also very similar the NX
400 was slightly down on the MP 500 here
though these results are pretty close to
margin of error stuff the access time
performance is a little off the right
results are much the same for both the
NX 400 and MP 500 while the newer NX 400
lacks a little when it comes to read
access time that said the results aren't
bad moving along to our on disk copy
test results the nx500 again
demonstrates MP 500 light performance at
edged ahead in our game copy tests
they're only by a 5% margin I should
note though that neither of these tests
move more than three gigabytes worth of
data so throttling won't be a problem
here the idea isn't to move around large
volumes of data but instead hit the
drives of the mixture of small and large
compressed and non compressed files
finally we have the 7-zip file
extraction test and here we do work with
a large 38 gigabyte archive and as you
can see the samsung 960 if I was
previously good for around one gigabyte
per second it now drops down to 660
megabytes per second for the average
transfer speed that said the nx500 was
still quite a bit slower and despite
avoiding any throttling issues isn't
really able to make a step forward from
the MP 500 an SSD which clearly didn't
suffer from any throttling issues
loading windows the nx500 took just five
point four seconds which is longer than
the four point four seconds the MP 500
took but better than the six point three
seconds the nine
de veau takes the call of duty' infinite
warfare level load time test took just
8.1 seconds which is very impressive
given the 960 Evo took 8.4 seconds and
the NP 500 11 seconds so good
improvement over the NP 500 here okay so
time to sum up core says new nx500 SSD
hmm I'm coming away with this one with
similar feelings that of my MP 500
review I guess that makes sense as they
are very similar products in a nutshell
my only real issue with the MP 500 was
the price and that was a shame given the
drive suffered no real weaknesses yes it
is slower than the Samsung 960 series
sometimes quite a lot slower in the
benchmarks but even so overall the NPD
500 was very capable and at no time did
it feel anything but blistering fast my
point is even power users won't notice a
difference between the MP 500 and the
960 pro for the vast majority of
workloads the same is true when looking
at the nx500
it's another solid all-rounder and under
prolonged torture won't buckle though
neither did the MP 500 once again the
issue here is the asking price the 400
gigabyte model that I reviewed will be
incoming at 320 dollars u.s. and while
that's a better price than the zotac
Sonic's for example it's still
significantly more than the current
asking price of the MP 500 480 gigabyte
and Samsung 960 Evo 500 gigabyte in fact
it's more than the 960 pro 512 gigabyte
as well pricing will no doubt improve
over time that said though there's
really no way Corsair can match the
current price of the MP 500 with this
new nx500 drive it's clearly a more
costly product to produce is a lot more
material a lot more product here when
compared to your standard m2 device so
keep that in mind and given that there
is really no advantage to this product
over the MP 500 the MP 500 doesn't
throttle will have any performance
issues when sustaining large writes so
paying a premium for the NX 500 is a bit
of a tough sell paying a premium for the
960 pro on the other hand to avoid
throttling issues now that would be well
worth it so take
note Samsung anyway in short the corset
nx500 is a great SSD and off the solid
performance it runs cool as you've just
seen has an excellent endurance rating
and comes with a competitive five-year
warranty
the only problem being it needs to be
I'd say at least twenty percent cheaper
than the current MSRP and I think that's
what I'm going to leave this one a good
product just needs to be a little more
competitively priced I'm your host Steve
