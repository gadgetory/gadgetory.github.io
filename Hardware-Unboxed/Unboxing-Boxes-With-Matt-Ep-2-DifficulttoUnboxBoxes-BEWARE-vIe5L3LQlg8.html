with matt this is episode number two and
today I'm going to be unboxing some
boxes and they all seem to be of the
brown variety but I do have a yellow DHL
envelope so why don't we start with that
I hoped it would be this so I've got the
huawei p 9 which is dead brand new
smartphone and they've been pushing this
big time in Australia I got ScarJo in
the ad which I'm obviously a fan of and
this is the device is so wrapped up nice
and tight nice looking phone so
something interesting about this thing
it actually has dual cameras on the back
and that's meant to help with low light
situations one camera is like mono
monochrome and the other ones color so
combine those two images so looking
forward to testing that thing up short
what next Gary this thing this seems
like a vault now I'm hoping this is my
tight maps that's what I'm hoping I'm
getting a tightness so much tape Oh
looks like it was the type next so
obviously not the type next time around
what was actually in that box before was
this so this is a mechanical keyboard
from China company called gran bella
unni lots of requests to do budget
peripherals so they reached out to me
and I thought why not take a look so
this is it it's a red that it's
multicolored so it's not RGB but each
line of keys is a different colors will
be interesting to see how that looks got
blue switches which do seem to feel a
lot like the charea mixes but they're
definitely not official cherry MX is all
right what's next
cool so this is 993 ATX so you might be
wondering why I picked that up it's not
a new product obviously but I've got it
to compare to the RX 470 which I'm
hoping I'll get my hands on very soon it
actually is the same core count
configuration so will be very
interesting to compare architectures
with these two cards next up get a
headset I've been looking forward to
getting for a while so I don't you guys
but I find it's super annoying having
cabled headset honestly like I don't
mind having a wired keyboard wired mouse
is fine but the headphone cable always
seems to get in the way so this is the
new razor manowar headset and I'm happy
to say it's completely wireless this is
just a receiver with an extension on it
and this headset itself so they're
pretty big and chunky but they're also
pretty light and really comfortable to
look forward to that review soon all
right one box to go and it's from
g.skill
I've got a good idea of what this will
be small bubble so somebody might not
know but g.skill make keyboards and mice
now so this is a flagship keyboard it's
got a crapload of features and I'm
really looking forward to checking that
without last but not least there ripjaws
mouth so keep an eye out for those
reviews I'll have those up hopefully
within a week maybe two weeks and it
looks like all I've got to run box today
