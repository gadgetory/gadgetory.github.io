video a big thank you to our sponsors
for supporting this year's Computex
coverage check out course has fancy new
vengeance RGB memory and if you're after
a new rig that won't send you broke
MSI's got you covered
check out the latest msi gaming pc
setups and learn how you can build an
incredible new gaming rig that's light
on your wallet make sure you check out
the link below in the video description
welcome back to harbor unbox today we
are at the msi booth and they have some
p450 boards for us we also have an
amazing-looking X 399 bought so I'm
going to show that to you guys
few other cool things so let's go check
it out first off at the msi booth is the
be 450 motherboards we have the be 450
tomahawk and the be 450 a pro both of
these boards have a four plus two vrm
and we are we don't know what to expect
in terms of performance so next month
July 31st is when we will be able to do
reviews on these boards but we are
expecting a refined board design
obviously refined by us so we'll be able
to take advantage of the Samsung video
memory will tighten up those sub timings
and show you guys how they perform next
month msi told us that although they
only had to be 450 boards on display at
Computex we can expect a full range of
boards to be available soon
as I mentioned earlier these boards do
only include a 4 + 2 V arm so that means
you really only want to be overclocking
the six core and lower end horizon parts
but we imagine if you're serious about
overclocking the horizon 7 parts you'll
probably get your hands on a new x4 70
board such as the x4 78 gaming Pro
carbon which was also on display well we
are expecting improved buyer support for
the B 450 boards a big advantage is the
fact that all these models will support
second generalise and CPUs right out of
the box and actually having said that
going forward support for all future
CPUs without the correct BIOS won't be
an issue with any MSI be 450 board as
they all include
a BIOS flash button on the i/o panel
that will allow the user to update the
boss without requiring a CPU at all
again msi says that this feature will be
supported by all their be 450 boards
even the absolute cheapest models and
imagine this will become a standard msi
feature going forward so that's just
amazing news and I like to think that my
AMD superior compatible
the rant video had some influence here
but I'm probably giving myself too much
credit so let's just shuffle all along
and also on display alongside the be 450
mother words we have found the new Mac 2
graphics cards we have the RX 580 model
and the RX 570 model so MSI aren't
telling us what happened to the original
mech we don't know why they've gone
straight to mech - but that's fine
so the mech 2 has their talks fans so
we've got the talks 2.0 fans they say
it's the same cooling and everything
they had from the previous version they
were using so it's just now under the
Mac - branding okay so what we have here
is probably the most insane X 399 board
on the market it is the new MSI X 399
creation it has a nineteen phase vrm you
can put 7m 2 drives 3 go on the board
and then there's an expansion card for
another 4 and they all work at full
speed so great for content creators
loads of storage performance there and
here's a look at the m2 storage
expansion card that will be bundled with
the x3 node and creation motherboard MSI
calls it the expander arrow and it's a
PCIe x 16 card that supports an
additional 4 m2 nvme SSDs which are
cooled by a large aluminium heatsink
with active cooling essentially it looks
like a mini ITX graphics card so that's
pretty cool one thing's for sure I'm
really gonna need to stock up on m2
drives so I can test this thing out
later in the very excited about that
of course the x3 99 creation packs loads
of other features the i/o panel alone
includes 10 USB ports and there is a
type C port there for Gen 2 3.1 ports so
just loads of USB ports you also get
dual Gigabit LAN using intel controllers
and Intel 90 260 modules supporting 802
11 AC Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.0 MSI is
also included a clear CMOS switch here
which is very handy and we do get a BIOS
flash back button as well so you can
take advantage of that for updating to
future processes on this motherboard
without running into any problems as
we've mentioned there's also loads of
storage options in addition to those 7
me2 ports you do get 8 SATA ports as
well and MSI really is targeting
professionals with this board content
creators in particular as the name
suggests on that note it is great
see an X 399 board without gaming in the
title and this makes a lot more sense
that said though MSI hasn't done away
with some of the more fun things we do
get our GB of course there's plenty of
RGB lighting on the board it does look
quite good so if you want to work PC
that has a bit of flair then you will
appreciate the extra node own creation
MSI's also completely overhauled their
mystic lighting software for better
support and usability and this is
something Tim will cover an upcoming
video with some other exciting stuff
like MSI's new laptops and monitors at
this point we don't have any official
information on the next-gen thread
Ripper CPUs but MSI says that this board
does support them so great to know we've
got upcoming support there and I just
love the look and design of this board
the shattered glass themed bit crazy
without there but I think it looks
really good well that concludes our
coverage of the MSI booth a lot of cool
products really good to see some p450
boards finally really loved that x3 note
on creation board cannot wait to check
that out later in the especially with
some 2nd gen at thread Ripper CPUs
hopefully we hear about them soon so
stay tuned for our coverage because we
have a lot more coming at Computex 2018
see you guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
