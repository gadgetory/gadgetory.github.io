are going to discuss why right now is a
good time to build and you're going PC
was about this time last year that we
talked about why building a new gaming
PC was a bad idea but thankfully quite a
bit has changed since then and we'll go
over all that in this video so I think
it's fair to say that this time at last
year things weren't great ddr4 memory
prices were through the roof graphics
card prices were also through the roof
and availability was extremely poor and
on top of all of that we were at the end
of a few practicals from AMD we had a
number of product releases in coming on
the horizon where they're
second-generation rise in CPU so at the
time we didn't know the improvements
wouldn't be huge but we did suspect that
the release would help drive down
pricing of first-gen parts and this is
exactly what we saw then for entry level
gaming we were just a month away from
the arrival of Raven Ridge a m-- DS n
based ap use another point when getting
your hands on a discrete GPU was costly
and difficult the promise of decent
integrated graphics couldn't have come
at a better time third on the other side
of the fence we had Intel and they're
yet to be fully released coffee-like
series along with supporting chipsets
back in January of 2017 you could still
only pair an eighth gen core processor
with a Zed 370 motherboard and pricing
started at a hundred and ten dollars
u.s. for budget shoppers this really
didn't make that much sense and almost
eliminated the otherwise great value
core i3 8100 we knew motherboard makers
at the time we're prepping B 360 H 310
and H 370 motherboards we just didn't
know they would mostly end up being a
waste of time so fast forward a year
what's changed well for one memory
prices have dropped significantly and
this is something we've predicted would
happen by early 2019
back in January 2018 the cheaper 16
gigabyte ddr4 kit that I could find cost
170 dollars u.s. and today we're almost
half that figure so I think it's fair to
say that memory prices have dropped take
G skills popular Ripjaws 5 Series for
example a 16 gigabyte kit of the ddr4
3000 memory cost just a hundred and five
dollars us back in January
of 2017 however after prices continued
to rise throughout 2017 and peak by
November we entered 2018 with the same
memory costing $200 u.s. based on
official pricing from Newegg that's
essentially a doubling of price a year
later and for much of 2017 pricing held
steady at $180 us and didn't start to
fall till around August finally we're
now back down to early 2017 memory
pricing so I don't expect ddr4 prices to
fall much further from this point but at
least we can now shave an extra hundred
dollars off the cost of a gaming system
with 16 gigabytes of memory now moving
on from memory to graphics cards it's
fair to say that the demand from
cryptocurrency - has died off now that
the value of cryptocurrency has pretty
well imploded it's collapsing on itself
let's say a graphics card pricing began
to fall quite sharply in August last
year and naturally availability improved
at the same time take the Radeon rx 570
for example currently our favorite
budget mid-range GPU it comes at an MSRP
of 170 dollars u.s. and upon release in
April 2017 was available at that price
that said just two short months later
prices began to increase hitting a $190
US and 210 and by September was selling
everywhere for at least 250 dollars
though most outlets were unable to
provide stock by January 2018 the
cheapest rx 570s cost 290 dollars u.s.
that was an insane 70 percent price Ike
from it to release nine months earlier
if that wasn't bad enough by February
prices hit 335 dollars u.s. at Newegg
while other outlets were charging $370
u.s. or even more by June availability
and pricing started to improve though
gamers were still faced with ridiculous
asking prices you know things have been
bad when a $290 X 570 seems like a good
deal then by mid-october we were finally
starting to see pricing drop back down
to MSRP levels and gamers rejoiced at
the opportunity to buy one or even two
year old technology at the release price
over the coming months prices continue
to drop in holiday sales saw the
I have 70 selling for as little as 130
dollars u.s. which isn't incredible by
today you can expect to pay around 150
dollars u.s. which is still a great deal
especially for a GPU that can easily
tear through the latest and greatest
titles using high quality settings at
1080p for now this is as good as
graphics card pricing is really going to
get won't be until AMD unleash Navi
later in the year that we might see
improved performance at these price
points and frankly if you need an
upgrade now I just wouldn't bother
holding out and videos 2050 they'll come
out soon but I don't expect that that
will hold a candle to the price versus
performance ratio of something like the
rx 570 for example as for CPU prices
well it depends on which way you want to
go there all right now Intel CPUs are
still a little overpriced the core i7
8700 K for example has an MSRP of 360
dollars but right now seems to be
typically selling for three hundred and
ninety dollars u.s. so it's not terrible
but it's not great either
most Intel CPUs such as the core i5 add
you 400 or Core i3 8100 are about 10 to
20 dollars over the MSRP so not a really
big deal and if you want to go with
Intel then well this won't stop you
honestly if I was after an extreme
high-end gaming rig with an RT X 20 80
or 20 80 TI I'd get either the 87 or
okay 9700 K or 9900 K so I'm by no means
an AMD fanboy or Schiller whatever the
loopy extremists on the other side
wouldn't come up with that said if I was
a budget conscious shopper which I
definitely am I'd get the rise in 5 2604
$165 u.s. and right now you do get a
free copy of Tom Clancy's the division -
okay enough Schilling now my check had
better be in the mail AMD Athlon is
gonna land really poorly with the folks
who don't understand sarcasm which could
be quite a few people of the youtube
comment section has anything to go by
moving on in all seriousness an unlocked
brand new 6 chord 12 thread CPU $165
really is an incredible Buy if you pair
that with a 150 dollar X 570 then get
yourself a hundred dollars worth of ddr4
memory which at the moment is a 16
gigabyte kit then you'll end up with an
exceptionally good 1080p gaming machine
in fact Tim recently built such a
machine he thinks it's pretty brilliant
and this is coming from a man who often
games with an RT x28 e TI on one of
those $2,000 us 4k 144 Hertz
HDR displays but like I said there are a
number of affordable CP options from
both AMD and Intel right now you could
certainly argue and I'm sure many of you
will in the comments section below that
it would be better to wait for AMD to
release their Zen true based processes
the seven nanometer rise in 3000 series
should be pretty bloody impressive but
keep in mind you could wait for months
for those parts and even then it could
be a few more months before we get the
sub $200 models of course if you can
wait well feel free to do so but in this
industry there's always something new
right around the corner and I feel like
with what's available right now you
can't really go to wrong also one way to
measure the value of a PC is by what it
enables and right now affordable GPUs
and CPUs enable a seriously fun gaming
experience so if you've been holding off
then I recommend you just stop doing
that
stop robbing yourself of any potential
fun and just finally there's also the
used market and recently we did a big
GPU roundup looking a whole heap of GPU
categories and then obviously the
graphics cards that are available there
and there was plenty of GeForce ten
series cards Vega rx 400 and 500 series
graphics cards so plenty of pretty new
graphics cards at reasonable discounts
so certainly worth checking out if
you're trying to save every last dollar
and that is going to do it for this one
