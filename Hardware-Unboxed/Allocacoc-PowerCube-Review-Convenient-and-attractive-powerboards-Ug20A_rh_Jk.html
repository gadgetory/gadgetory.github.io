small gear shift and taking a look at a
product it's a little different to my
typical variety of graphics cards and
gaming peripherals I've got on death the
power cube from a brand that I have no
idea how to pronounce a loco cook and
this is one that might appeal to those
of you that salivate over setup war
style videos admittedly initially this
wasn't really a product that quite got
my adrenaline pumping
but having actually put it to use now
there's a lot of things about it that
makes so much sense
sadly nikola tesla failed in his efforts
for free wireless power for all so for
now we're stuck with wires and power
bricks all over the place and in 2016
when i'm plugging stuff into a power
board now i have to issue where i can't
use one of the power points because
there's a large overhanging brick next
to it it drives me freaking nuts this is
the first problem that the power cube
solves the fact that it's a cube means
that no matter how obnoxiously large the
dump our bricks you're stabbing into it
are they can't block the other power
points boom a local coke get a big tick
from me here they look pretty cool too
probably about as cool as a powerball
can look really the splash of color is
nice and i like the way the whole unit
looks i suppose there's nothing special
in the end but it's a power board so you
know i'm always glad to see the emission
of RGB ease on this one now i need to
mention that these power cubes are not
designed for power conditioning or surge
protection they're really purely for
convenience and possibly looks so if
you're looking for something that'll
provide strong protection for your
devices this probably isn't the board
you're after both models i have to look
at today the extended models meaning
rather than plugging directly into a
socket or each other they have a 1.5
meter extension cable at the back the
two units are very different however one
is the pure extended model with the
extension cord of five outlets and then
the other model i have is the extended
USB model which figure is one of the
power outlets and replaces it with two
five volt and two amp USB power outlets
for charging in devices it doesn't come
with any USB cable so you'll be
providing your own hand another cool
inclusion is the little mounting bracket
that allows you to stick the power cube
to the top or bottom of your desk there
anyway you want really a local coke
includes to 3m style adhesive pads for
sticking the mountain to your desired
surface lastly and there's a small
plastic collar with a screw hole you can
slide up and down the extension cable to
allow you to implement some more of your
epic cable management skills now I've
only got the two extender models on hand
here today but there's a whole range of
power cubes to choose from the original
power cubes plug directly into a socket
and don't feature the extension cable
that these do and these can be stacked
up as mentioned there's also a five
outlet version and the USB edition too
so you could plug either of these into
the extender models if you required
additional outlets overall I think the
power cubes are pretty cool product and
it actually solves a few problems I
didn't really realize I had I'm
personally not trying to win any style
Awards with my personal setup but even
if I was I'd still have the power cube
up on top of my desk where I can quickly
and easily plug in new devices and also
charge multiple USB devices to having
the painful power brick overhang issues
solved the godsend also so I'm
definitely happy about that the power
cubes are really widely available even
in Australia and you can pick up any
model in basically any color from Cogan
for the 15 bucks or $25 depending on
whether you want USB included or not
pricing is similar in the States with
all models available in Amazon between
fourteen and twenty five US dollars I
think this could be the first time where
I've seen absolutely no Australia tax is
