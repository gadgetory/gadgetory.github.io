I'm your host Matt and today we're
having a look at Logitech's new flagship
mechanical gaming keyboard the G 9/10
Orion's bark there's a few things you'll
notice right away just taking a look at
the G 9 tens box first the amazing array
of colors all the different features and
buttons and the extensive palm rest it
makes it pretty clear it's going to take
up plenty of room on your desk and make
an impression Logitech is also
implementing its all-new Romeo G
switches which have been designed from
the ground up for gaming and for RGB
lighting we'll see how these compared to
the industry standard shortly but first
let's open up the box and take a look
alright so first up we got the logitech
gaming beat blue g on the inner box and
on top we got a first look at the
keyboard itself so talk about that in a
second
underneath you just got the set-up guide
just stuck in this is the
interchangeable palm rest
now let's take a look at the keyboard
itself so all the exterior surfaces are
made of plastic now we've got your
gaming Keys down the left here there's
five down the left and you've also got
another four at the top you've got your
profile switching keys at the top very
top left corner and also the macro
record button to across the top you've
got this is a Windows lock key so you
can lock the windows keys while you're
gaming you've got the back light toggle
via the media buttons in the top corner
mute and logitech's also stuck on a
rubberized volume adjustment wheel here
another flashy feature that Logitech's
included is this ARX dock up the top so
this actually slides out and you can
stick your phone in here so you can keep
it in your peripherals while you're
gaming this is also handy if you're
checking your stats and switching
between profiles and Logitech's app now
the keys themselves these are a little
different to anything I've ever talked
on before the key caps are unique sort
of a dish design you see the ones over
here on the left the gaming keys
they actually have sort of a three
faceted dish and the WASD Keys are sort
of all faceted over on the right on the
the rest of the typing keys there's only
two sort of grooves angles and you find
the arrow keys are the same as the WASD
keys strangely shift and control are
sort of flat and the windows kids are
actually convex now lunch taps go on
with this unique design so that you can
always know where your fingers are
without looking down this is awesome for
gaming but probably not quite as good
for general typing because you can't
just glide your fingers across the
keyboard just sort of do you need to
lift them a little higher than normal
otherwise you can sort of get caught on
these bottom corners you're probably
either get a love or absolutely hate the
key caps on this keyboard the romaji
switches which
mentioned earlier the other unique
feature of this board these switches
have an actuation point of 1.5
millimeters compared to the standard 2
millimeters on your Cherry MX switches
which is sort of the industry standard
at the moment for mechanical keyboards
don't you take claims that this makes
the keyboard register you key presses
25% faster which is true and you can
feel the responsiveness of this keyboard
the keys do have a tactile feel but I've
got to say for me personally it's not as
satisfying click as you get from the
Cherry MX switches
it's definitely sort of more of a mushy
feel to them and I don't think anyone
that loves the Cherry MX switches are
going to use this keyboard and fall in
love immediately and be converted
overall the g9 10 is a really cool
gaming keyboard if that's what you want
to use it for let's just take could be
onto a winner with their very Majeed
switches and I'll be looking forward to
future models that use them the igb
lighting is the best that I've seen and
gamers won't be left wanting any more
programmable keys or profiles or
features thanks for watching this video
