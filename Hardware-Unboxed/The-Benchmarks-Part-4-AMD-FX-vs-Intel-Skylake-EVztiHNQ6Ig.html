then a little building we now have two
pretty cool looking gaming rigs for the
most part both systems are much the same
the key difference of course being the
platforms used from the red team we have
the AMD fx-8350 motherboard the blue
team is being represented by the core i5
6400 and dead 170 motherboard combo in
today's money the AMD system costs
around 1,100 USD to build which works
out to be about 1,700 AUD the Intel
system on the other hand was slightly
more pricey at 1150 us or almost 1,800
Australian dollars keep in mind that
although the core i5 6500 costs almost
sixty percent more than the FX 8320 the
total system build cost comes out at
less than ten percent more with the
exception of the motherboard and
processor the rest of the systems are
much the same they'll both built into
the silverstone chalo 5 case feature a
gigabytes of memory a single radeon r9
390 the silverstone t do to slim liquid
cooler and the silverstone strider
essentials 700 watt power supply the
Windows 10 operating system was
installed on the samsung SSD a 50 evo
fire and gigabyte model and the western
digital blue for terabyte was used as a
secondary storage device both processors
were overclocked though I realized that
intel has done it's best to close the
door on non k overclocking so the
results have been included for those
that are still interested in running the
previous bios obviously the Radeon r9
390 will be handling all the rendering
and I've decided to test as both 1080p
and 1440p the 1080p results should help
to remove GPU bottlenecks exposing any
weakness on the CPU side most game is
spending over a thousand us on a gaming
rig you're probably targeting 1440p
gaming those so those result to be
included too with all that said let's
move on to the benchmarks battlefield 4
single-player campaign isn't very CPU
intensive so you might wonder why we
included it the idea here will be the
show a range of games some cpu intensive
and some not so much starting with
battlefield 4 we see that even with the
radeon r9 390 the FX 8320 in core i5
6400 delivered
similar results even when overclocked
increasing the resolution from 1080p to
1440p does nothing to change the
performance margins as you might expect
batman arkham knight is clearly a cpu
intensive title and as a result the
stock standard FX 8320 looks quite weak
when compared to the core i5 6400
despite delivering a very playable
average framerate even the minimum 54
FPS is acceptable although when compared
to the 106 FPS of the 6400 the fifty
percent reduction in performance is
quite shocking overclocking the FX 2
8320 helps to minimize the damage is the
minimum frame rate is bolstered by
thirty percent 271 FPS increasing the
resolution the 1440p helps to minimize
the performance margin between the 8320
and the 6400 the average frame rates now
quite similar though the FX processor is
still thirty-three percent slower out of
the box when comparing the minimum frame
rate and a little over temps and slower
ones overclocked like Battlefield 4 the
single-player portion of black ops 3
isn't particularly demanding and we see
that the FX 8320 is able to deliver
similar performance to that of the core
i5 6400 increasing the resolution the
1440p doesn't really change the
performance margins again we see that
once overclocked the FX 8320 is able to
get the most from the Radeon r9 390 in
this title late last year I put together
a video showcasing the overclocking
performance of various nonketotic
processes and in that video the fx-8350
was also included used for testing was
fallout 4 along with a few other games
the fallout 4 results shocked a few
people not because of how fast the sky
processes were but rather how slow the
fx-8350 was at times dipping to just 17
FPS with a fury ax handling the red ring
as expected a few diehard AMD fans
questioned the accuracy of the results
quite a bit of effort on my behalf of
spent trying to improve the performance
the FX system but in the end I gave up
now a number of patches later we still
find the FX series can't hold a candle
to the sky processes in certain sections
of the game the frame rates in the
Boston City section of the game
significantly lower than other sections
of the game even on the Intel processors
still despite the heavy overclock the
4.8 gigahertz affects 8320 isn't able to
come this issue here you'll see is
increasing the resolution to 1440p
doesn't reduce the performance of the
radeon r9 390 in this section of fallout
4 the FX 8320 still did still just 25
FPS with the 28 FPS average the cry 5
6400 also delivered virtually the same
performance in both it's out of the box
and overclocked configurations here we
see that the fallout 4 performance is
significantly different to what we saw
when testing in Boston as we exit the
vault the FX 8320 saw a 50 FPS minimum
with an average of over 60 FPS it is
worth noting that the core i5 6400 out
at standard operating frequencies was
still faster than the overclocked FX
8320 now at 1440p we find that the bulb
section of the game still plays
reasonably well in the FX 8320 and
finally the 4.8 gigahertz overclock is
able to deliver a little extra
performance that said the stock core i5
6400 is still fourteen percent faster
than the heavily overclocked FX
processor Just Cause 3 is another very
CPU intensive video game and as such the
FX 8320 really suffers here at 1080p the
overclocked ffs 8320 it was good for
just 51 FPS on average with a 36 FPS
minimum meanwhile the 6400 never dropped
low 45 FPS alone for a 63 FPS average
increasing the resolution 1440p had
little impact on the FX 8320 performance
as we're already cpu limited at 1080p
the core i5 6400 became noticeably
slower at 1440p but was still a great
deal faster than the FX processor Mad
Max is a GPU limited game this is why we
see the FX 8320 in core i5 6400
providing identical performance of 1080p
naturally increasing the resolution of
1440 p does nothing to change the
performance margins and again we find
that the AMD and Intel processors
deliver the same performance like Mad
Max in battlefield 4 we find that
rainbow 6 siege is another game that's
primarily GPU dependent as a result all
configurations are able to get the most
out of the Radeon r9 390 moving to 1440p
removes virtually all performance
margins and we see just one FPS
separating the fastest configuration
from the slowest the core i5 6400
enjoyed a slight performance advantage
at 1080p so it has to be said that the
FX 8320 was more the
capable here upping the resolution the
1440p eliminated any performance
variables allowing the FX 8320 to match
the core i5 6400 The Witcher 3 results
are probably the most shocking of seen
so far even at 4.8 gigahertz the FX 8320
is seriously outclassed by the stock
core i5 6400 which average 65 FPS making
it 27 percent faster overclock the 6,500
was a beast reaching an average frame
rate of 86 FPS increasing the resolution
to 1440p narrowed the gap between the
overclocked and stop core i5 6400
configurations but it didn't help the FX
8320 close in on the 6400 which remained
almost thirty percent faster when
comparing the average frame rate in the
out-of-the-box configurations the core
i5 6500 consumed just over twenty
percent less power than the FX 8320 once
overclocked that figure increased it was
crazy to see the power meter reading
over 500 watts the AMD system and just
shy of 400 watts for the Intel system
given the relative performance the
margins were even greater than looking
at the call of duty black ops 3 power
figures here the core i5 6400 consumed
twenty-seven percent less power and over
thirty percent less once both processors
were overclocked it's hardly a surprise
that the Intel skylight core i5 system
delivered superior performance this
should be well established now that the
AMD FX range is inferior what gives the
FX process is some merit is the price
just one hundred twenty dollars the FX
8320 is considerably cheaper than the
190 dollar core i5 6400 as I said
earlier that makes the Intel processor
almost sixty percent more expensive and
if I reviewing these CPUs side-by-sides
that figure would have a huge impact
however in the grand scheme of things
the seventy dollar price difference
doesn't account for much less than ten
percent of the total build cost in fact
so if I gave you the option of the red
box or the blue box with the latter
costing just six percent more which one
would you choose just paying almost
sixty percent more for the core i5 6500
make any difference of course not and
this is the problem AMD faces for any
system build exceeding five hundred
dollars the CPU savings becoming pretty
much irrelevant beyond that point
particularly given the resulting
performance overclocked are not with all
things considered the blue box is
unquestionably the one I'd be
recommending hopefully later in the year
drawn to the red team once then lands
fingers crossed right as always i'm your
host Matt and i'll see you guys next
