then a little building we now have two
pretty cool-looking gaming rigs for the
most part both systems are much the same
the key difference of course being the
platforms used from the red team we have
the AMD FX 8350 motherboard and the blue
team is being represented by the core i5
6400 and dead 170 motherboard combo in
today's money the AMD system cost around
eleven hundred USD to build which works
out to be about 1700 AUD the Intel
system on the other hand was slightly
more pricey at 1150 us or almost 1800
Australian dollars keep in mind that
although the core i5 6500 costs almost
60% more than the FX 8320 the total
system build cost comes out at less than
10% more with the exception of the
motherboard and processor the rest of
the systems are much the same they were
both built into the Silverstone kalalau
5 case picture a gigabytes of memory a
single Radeon r9 390 the silverstone tdo
to slim liquid cooler and the
silverstone strider essentials 700 watt
power supply the Windows 10 operating
system was installed on the Samsung SSD
a 50 Evo fire and gigabyte model and the
Western Digital blue 4 terabyte was used
as a secondary storage device both
processors were overclocked though I
realized that Intel has done its best to
close the door on 9k overclocking so the
results have been included for those
that are still interested in running the
previous bios obviously the Radeon r9
390 will be handling all the rendering
and I've decided to test as both 1080p
and 1440 pins the 1080p results should
help to remove GPU bottlenecks exposing
any weakness on the CPU side most gamers
spending over a thousand u.s. on a
gaming rig you're probably turning 1440p
gaming those so those results to be
included too with all that said let's
move on to the benchmarks battlefield
for single-player campaign isn't very
CPU intensive so you might wonder why we
included it the idea here will be to
show a range of games some CPU intensive
and some
so much starting with battlefield 4 we
see that even with the Radeon r9 390 SFX
8320 in Core i5 6400 deliver very
similar results even when overclocked
increasing the resolution from 1080p to
1440p does nothing to change the
performance margins as you might expect
Batman Arkham Knight is clearly a CPU
intensive title and as a result the
stock standard FX 8320 looks quite weak
when compared to the core i5 6400
despite delivering a very playable
average framerate even the minimum 54
fps is acceptable
although when compared to the 106 FPS of
the 6400 the 50% reduction in
performance is quite shocking
overclocking the FX 283 20 it helps to
minimize the damage as the minimum frame
rate is bolstered by 30% 271 fps
increasing the resolution the 1440p
helps to minimize the performance margin
between the 8320 and the 6400 the
average frame rates are now quite
similar though the FX processor is still
33 percent slower out of the box when
comparing the minimum frame rate and a
little over 10% slower once overclocked
like battlefield 4 the single-player
portion of black ops 3 isn't
particularly demanding and we see that
the FX 83 20 years they would have
delivered similar performance to that of
the core i5 6400 increasing the
resolution the 1440p doesn't really
change the performance margins again we
see that once overclocked the FX 8320 is
able to get the most from the Radeon r9
390 in this title late last year I put
together a video showcasing the
overclocking performance of various
non-chaotic processors and in that video
the FX 8350 was also included use for
testing was fallout 4 along with a few
other games the fallout 4 resolves
shocked a few people not because of how
fast the sky processors were but rather
how slow the FX 8350 was at times
dipping to just 17 fps with a fury ax
handling the red ring as expected a few
diehard AMD fans questioned the accuracy
of the results quite a bit of effort on
my behalf of spent trying to improve the
performance the FX system but in the end
I gave up now a number of patches later
we still find the FX series can't hold a
candle to the sky processes in certain
sections of the game the frame rates in
the Boston City section of the game is
significantly lower than other sections
of the game even on the Intel processors
still despite the heavy overclock the
4.8 gigahertz FX 8320 isn't able to
overcome this issue here you'll see is
increasing the resolution to 1440p does
it reduce the performance of the Radeon
r9 390 in this section of Fallout 4 the
FX 83 20 is still dips to just 25 fps
with the 28 FPS average the Cry 5 6400
also delivered virtually the same
performance in both its out of the box
and overclocked configurations here we
see that the fallout 4 performance is
significantly different to what we saw
when testing in Boston as we exit the
vault the FX 83 20s saw a 50 FPS minimum
with an average of over 60 fps it is
worth noting that the core i5 6400 out
at standard operating frequencies was
still faster than the overclocked FX
8320 now at 1440p we find that the fault
section of the game still plays
reasonably well on the FX 8320 and
finally the 4.8 gigahertz overclock is
able to deliver a little extra
performance that said the stock core i5
6400 is still 14% faster than the
heavily overclocked FX processor Just
Cause 3 is another very CPU intensive
video game and as such the FX 8320
really suffers here at 1080p the
overclocked ffs 8320 it was good for
just 51 FPS on average with a 36 FPS
minimum
meanwhile the 6400 never dropped below
45 FPS allowing for a 63 FPS average
increasing the resolution the 1440p had
little impact on the FX 8320 performance
as we're already cpu limited at 1080p
the core i5 6400 became noticeably
slower at 1440p but was still a great
deal faster than the FX processor Mad
Max is a GPU limited game this is why we
see the FX 8320 in Core i5 6400
providing identical performance of 1080p
naturally increasing the resolution of
1440 PE does nothing to change the
performance margins and again we find
that the AMD and Intel processors
deliver the same performance like Mad
Max in battlefield 4 we find that
Rainbow six siege is another game that's
primarily GPU dependent as a result all
configurations are able to get the most
out of the Radeon r9 390 moving to 1440p
removes virtually all performance
margins and we see just one FPS
separating the fastest configuration
from the slowest the core i5 6400
enjoyed a slight performance advanced
at 1080p so it has to be said that the
FX 8320 was more than capable here
upping the resolution to 1440p
eliminated any performance variables
allowing the FX 8320 to match the core
i5 6400 The Witcher 3 results are
probably the most shocking you've seen
so far even at 4.8 gigahertz the FX 83
20 is seriously outclassed by the stock
core i5 6400 which average 65 fps making
it 27 percent faster overclocked the
6500 was a beast reaching an average
frame rate of 86 FPS increasing the
resolution 1440p narrowed the gap
between the overclocked in stock Core i5
6400 configurations but it didn't help
the FX 8320 close in on the 6,400 which
remained almost 30% faster when
comparing the average frame rate in the
out-of-the-box configurations the core
i5 6400 consumed just over 20% less
power than the FX 83 20 once overclocked
that figure increased it was crazy to
see the power meter reading over 500
watts for the AMD system and just shy of
400 watts for the Intel system given the
relative performance the margins were
even greater when looking at the call of
duty black ops 3 power figures here the
core i5 6400 consumed 27% less power and
over 30% less once both processors were
overclocked it's hardly a surprise that
the Intel skylake core i5 system
delivered superior performance this
should be well established now that the
AMD FX range is inferior what gives the
FX processor some merit is the price
just 120 dollars the FX 8320 is
considerably cheaper than the $190 core
i5 6400 as I said earlier that makes the
Intel processor almost 60% more
expensive and if I were reviewing these
CPUs side by sides that figure would
have a huge impact however in the grand
scheme of things the $70 price
difference doesn't account for much less
than 10% of the total build cost in fact
so if I gave you the option of the red
box or the blue box with the latter
costing just 60% more which one would
you choose just paying almost 60% more
for the core i5 6400 make any difference
of course not and this is the problem
AMD faces for any system build exceeding
500 dollars the CPU savings becoming
pretty much irrelevant beyond that point
particularly given the resulting
performance
overclocked or not with all things
considered the
box is unquestionably the one I'd be
recommending hopefully later in the year
I'll be drawn to the red team once then
lands fingers crossed right as always
I'm your host Matt and I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
