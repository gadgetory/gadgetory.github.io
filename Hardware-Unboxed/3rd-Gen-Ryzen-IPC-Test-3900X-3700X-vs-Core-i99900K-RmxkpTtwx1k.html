today's video I'm finally able to expand
upon the IPC testing feature in our day
1 coverage unfortunately I wasn't able
to do any IPC testing with the 3900 X
because this exact chip he actually died
during my review of the new 3rd gen
risin processor so if you want to hear
more about that then feel free to watch
that video but yeah this little guy here
is dead but the good news is I do have a
replacement now so I was able to go back
and compare the IPC performance between
a single chip lit with 8 cores enabled
to a pair of chip alerts with 4 cores
enabled in each one so all that testing
will be in this video now that I have my
replacement 3100 X so it's really time
for some more in-depth IPC testing I
think for those of you unaware IP C
stands for instructions per cycle and it
can be a good indicator of an
architectures efficiency traditionally
Intel's coffee-like CPUs have offered
high IPC coupled with a high operating
frequency that's really the best
combination for maximum performance
although AMD's still clearly trailing
when it comes to frequency they do a
pedo of really closed up and possibly
exceeded Intel's IPC performance and
that's likely why so many of you have
been requesting this particular test to
see just how much headway aim'd is made
here we're going to neutralize as many
variables as we can while also keeping
things as realistic as possible the
first and most obvious step is to remove
the core frequency from the equation and
to do this we've locked all CPUs at 4
gigahertz any type of boost technology
has been disabled and this means no
calls can clock past 4 gigahertz and all
cores are clocked at 4 gigahertz then
for the riser 930 900 X we've disabled
two cores and each chip --let taking it
from a 12 core part down to an 8 core
part so all CPUs tested have 8 cores
active but whereas the 3700 X has them
all in a single die for 3100 X spreads
them across 2 dies the third gen Reisen
CPUs have been tested on the gigabyte X
570 or extreme using the latest bias
which uses a g1 dot
0.3 a B then for the first and second
generation CPUs they've been tested on
their sous ROG crosshair seven hero and
the coffee-like CPUs on the gigabyte z3
19 horas ultra all configurations use
the same g.skill Flair X ddr4 3200
memory using the extreme memory profile
and the same msi RT x 20 IDC a gaming
extra was used for all the testing this
is purely a for science type benchmark
and is in no way buying advice the
coffee like CPUs do have a clock speed
advantage but that doesn't necessarily
make them the best choice for gaming and
real-world performance to find out which
CPU should buy a please refer to our
recent rise in 930 100x 3700 X and 3,600
reviews first up we have the Cinebench
our 20 multi-core score and here the
3100 X and 3700 X provided roughly the
same score making them both around 14%
faster than the 99er ok when matched
clock for clock moreover they were both
18 percent faster than 2700 X and that's
a significant improvement in IPC
performance here we see a 13 percent
performance uplift for the third gen
rising parts over the 2,700 X and this
meant they were also 9 percent faster
than the 99er ok so pretty incredible
stuff for these new rise and processors
here we see the jewel chip design of the
3100 x actually improves performance in
the very benchmark by a 2% margin over
3700 X not a big difference really but
it was consistently faster in this test
this meant when matched at the same
clock speed the 300 X was 6 percent
faster than Intel's Core I $9.99 ok and
13% fast on the 2,700 X this time the
3100 X was 3% faster than the 3700 xmin
looking at performance using the corona
benchmark this made the 3100 X 5% faster
than the 1900 K and 16% faster in the
2,700 X that's pretty impressive stuff
but let's move on to see how things look
in a few games the first game I'm going
to look at is battlefield 5 and here we
see despite a hefty reduction in clock
speed the 99er case still manages to
take out top spot the 1% low performance
was still very impressive and here the
19 a hurricane was 9 percent faster than
the 3rd gen rising processors when
looking at the average framerate we see
that the 3700 X was 8 percent fast and
the 20
while the 30 100x was 13% faster this
means that even when matched at the same
clock speed with the same number of
cores the 30 100 X is still 5 percent
faster than 3700 X which is very
interesting we see that the 1900 can
takes out top spot this time in Far Cry
New Dawn beating the 3900 X by a 5
percent margin for the average frame
rate but it was 10% faster for the 1%
lower result however what we should
probably focus on here is the impressive
step forward AMD has been able to make
here the 30 100x was incredibly 20
percent faster than the 2700 X while the
3700 X offered a 16 percent performance
improvement that's a very impressive
generational leap even at 1080p with the
RT X xx atti
Total War Three Kingdoms is mostly GPU
bound still we do see some improvements
than 1% low results and again Intel
comes out on top but as I've said we're
mostly GPU bound here so let's just move
on for those of you who missed my
discussion regarding the World War Z
results in my original 3rd gen rising
content in short the game received an
update that dramatically improves
performance but for whatever reason the
epic store didn't roll this update out
to me for over a week after its initial
release the good news is this update
sees rise and processors performs
significantly better and now the 3100 X
is able to roughly match the 1900 ok
in our IPC test again the dual chip tlit
1300 X was fast and the single chip
alert 3,700 X this time offering a 4%
bump for the average frame rate this
meant the 3100 X was 14 percent faster
than 2700 X while the 37 Rx was 9
percent faster another game that I
decided to check out is World of Tanks
and this game has been recently
redesigned to take better advantage of
core heavy CPUs interestingly when
matched at the same clock speed the 3100
X provided better 1% low performance
than the 99 or ok boosting performance
here by a 4% margin though the average
framerate performance was much the same
the 3100 X was faster than the 3700 X
improving performance by 4% this again
made the 300 X 13 percent faster than
2700 X while the 3700 X was 9% faster
than the 2,700 X the last game that
we'll look at is Rainbow six siege and
here the night ROK was a good bit
at least when looking at the average
frame rate I mean it was just 5% faster
than the 39 Rx and eight percent faster
the 3700 XO not a massive margin but it
was still faster that said the one
percent low performance was similar
across the board and here we're looking
at another mostly GPU bound game with
these higher-end CPUs something I
discovered when first testing the Rison
7 3700 X was the much lower than
expected right memory bandwidth after
speaking with AMD they filled me in on
what's going on here basically AMD's
made a compromise here as client
workloads do very little writing so
rather than use this space to improve
something that isn't required or at
least not going to be fully utilized
they've invested this silicon real
estate in more beneficial ways to
achieve performance gains the end result
being that the core complex data i/o die
link for reading memory is 32 bytes wide
but it's only 16 bytes wide for writing
however because the 1,300 X has to see
CDs it features two lanes from writing
and that brings the peak bandwidth back
up to around 50 gigabytes per second
moving on to cache bandwidth and here we
see the 3700 X and 3900 X are virtually
identical and both offer substantial
gains for l1 l2 and l3 bandwidth over
the second gen Verizon 2700 X here we
see l3 cache bandwidth has been
increased anywhere from around 40 to 50
percent with the third gen rise and
parts we also see a 30% improvement l2
bandwidth and an almost 100 percent
increase in l1 bandwidth that's an
incredible performance uplift and it
certainly would go a long way in
explaining why we saw a 100% performance
gain in applications such as WinRAR as
for memory latency well not much has
changed here if anything we see an
increase in memory latency from second
gen Rison and we see this when looking
at DRAM and l3 cache latency the DRAM
latency is 50% higher than that of the
kora 999 okay and this will be partly
responsible for the difference we see in
gaming performance another reason for
the slightly lower gaming performance is
called latency still when compared to
second generalising the new third gen
architecture is a massive improvement
for the best match cause we're seeing a
30% reduction in latency and at least a
26% reduction for the worst cause
or Maine's best case the cortical
latency is actually reduced by 35% for
the third generation processor when
compared to the Intel coffee-like
architecture and that's pretty good
problem is worst case the latency is 54%
higher and that really isn't very good
especially when playing at latency
sensitive games okay so it's pretty
clear AMD's made a big step forward with
third gen risin we really knew that from
the moment we first tested the 3700 X
and 3900 X we were also expecting good
things especially after AMD well the
world at Computex this year claiming a
massive 15% uptick in IPC performance
and they weren't exaggerating either
with cos and clock speeds at parity the
3100 X provided an 18% improvement over
the 2700 X in center benches multi-core
test than 13% for the single core test
we saw a 13 percent improvement in v-ray
and then a 16 percent improvement in
Corona and then when you average all
that together that actually gives you a
15 percent improvement in IPC
performance you can't really use games
to measure IPC performance but they're
still interesting to look at 4 o'clock 4
o'clock comparisons one obvious issue
with games is that they're not always
CPU bound and even when they are the
degree to which they are CPU bound can
vary for example we saw a very minor
performance gains in rainbow 6 siege and
Total War Three Kingdoms but in those
two tiles we were obviously quite
heavily GPU bound the 3900 X was between
13 to 14 percent faster than the 2,700 X
when testing with World of Tanks World
War Z and battlefield 5 and that's
pretty close to AMD's 15 percent claim
which again doesn't necessarily apply
here then of course we saw a much more
significant 20 percent performance
improvement in Far Cry New Dawn given
more time and actually like to go back
and include a scar like X processor in
these results that could be really
interesting though probably makes sense
just to wait for the third gen through
her past at this point before making
that comparison not sure about that one
