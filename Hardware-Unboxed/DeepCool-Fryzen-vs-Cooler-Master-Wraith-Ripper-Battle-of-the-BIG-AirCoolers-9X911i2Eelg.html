are testing out two big air coolers
designed for use with AMD's new thread
ripper cpus here we have one big air
cooler and here we have one bloody
massive air cooler the question is which
one works better to answer that very
question I am going to be comparing
their cooling performance on the 32 core
through 429 90 WX is both these air
coolers were developed with that
monsterous processor in mind in fact
earlier this year at Computex 2018 we
sort of caught wind that AMD would be
announcing some bigger beefier 2nd gen 3
receiver used because of these coolers
they kind of gave it away at least they
did for us and we knew it wasn't going
to be just the architectural refinements
that we saw on the rise and 7 and rise
in five parts for the desktop the six
and eight core mainstream models now
this is because Coolermaster and deep
core we're flaunting these new colors at
the Computex tradeshow claiming that
they could handle up to 250 watt
processors and given that the 1950 X is
only that's slept with a 180 watt TDP if
I'm not mistaken we knew something was
up there because there was no way that
the 2950 X if it was still to just be a
16 core processor which evidently it is
it would have a 250 watt rating that
just didn't seem likely and then of
course the next day
AMD did announce the 2990 WX the world's
first 32 core desktop CPU and these
things all started to make sense for my
initial 2990 WX coverage I used the
wraith ripper for the first time and
found remarkably low operating
temperatures just 59 degrees after an
hour-long stress test though it was a
little noisy with the 120 millimeter
fans spinning it between 2300 and 2600
rpm nothing too excessive and given the
results the operating volume was
acceptable the plan was to revisit the
wraith ripper in more detail after my
initial 2990 WX coverage but as usual
something more pressing came along and
well in this case I never actually got
back to it that is until now of course
but with the recent arrival of frozen I
thought what better time than to test
two big old air coolers
than right now Before we jump into the
results let's just take a quick look at
each cooler and I will start with the
Wraiths Ripper as we're quite familiar
reasonably familiar with this product
having already tested it in our day line
coverage obviously it's an absolutely
massive cooler it measures a hundred and
fifty millimeters wide 132 millimeters
deep and it is a hundred and sixty-one
millimeters tall and it tips the scales
at one thousand six hundred and seven
grams and you might think okay well a
good amount of those dimensions are
probably fans but in the case of this
cooler it's actually mostly heatsink the
Rays river packs just a single 120
millimeter fan sandwiched between the
dual tower style heater sink and it's
ready to operate between zero and 2700
rpm the heatsink and heat pipes of which
there are many but I'll get to that in a
moment
then the heatsink and heat pipes have
been painted black and Coulomb Asus has
the black paint enhances radiation
cooling performance it's commonly
understood that black or dark surfaces
absorb heat rather than reflect it as
lighter colored surfaces tend to do
however the same principle applies of
heat dissipation as it works the other
way as well so a black surface will
indeed dissipate heat more efficiently
than a lighter colored surface in the
case of the Wraith River we're probably
talking only a few percent but hey
that's better than nothing and as a
bonus it looks really tough adding to
the Wraith rippers toughness factor our
seven heat pipes that weave their way
through the baseplate it's a seriously
busy looking cooler the baseplate of
course offers full TR for coverage
measuring forty five millimeters by 72
millimeters then capping off the design
is a plastic cover that wraps around
both sides and in cases the 120
millimeter fan the internal fan doesn't
feature any RGB lighting rather it's
been migrated to the plastic cover and I
have to admit it does look pretty
awesome there are two translucent strips
that run from one side up over the top
of the cooler and then down the opposite
side and Coolermaster has allowed the
RGB lighting to be controlled via
software and they supply utilities
designed specifically to work with the
Wraiths Ripper then the key to all the
easiest installation process ever
that's what Coolermaster claims and
their bang on there are four screw heads
in the top of the cooler simply a line
up the tr4 socket fasten the screws and
you're done
it's an absolutely brilliant design the
only issue I see with this product is
the price and then I suppose the poor
availability I despite getting my hands
on one of these for testing in my day
long coverage over a month ago now they
don't appear to be on sale in the US yet
I've seen them listed on Amazon that
says currently unavailable so not sure
when they will be available lot so you
guys keep asking me when will it be
available and I don't see able to get
any solid information on that oddly
though there are a few select retailers
in Australia that have stock and are
selling them for an insane 210 dollars
Aussie so it means for Less smaller you
can grab the corsair hydro series h 115
i or the deep cool castle 280 for
example the suggested retail price is a
hundred and twenty dollars u.s. so as
usual the australian price doesn't mean
to be quite heavily inflated but ever so
the wraith ripper is still a seriously
expensive air cooler so at least in
terms of pricing it appears to be
advantage deep cool as the frozen is
coming in at ninety dollars us and is
currently available at that price so all
it's available in the US not available
in australia yet so sort of the opposite
situation here i expect it to come in at
about 130 140 Yazzie if we're not seeing
any kind of crazy australia tax on that
one in any case this is still a very
expensive air cooler so it will need to
perform if we are to seriously consider
it i have to say while a nice looking
cooler it seems rather underwhelming
sitting next to the wraith ripper it's a
much smaller cooler measuring 124
millimeters wide 82 millimeters deep and
165 millimetres tall that being the case
it weighs 36% less at 1036 grams so
still a heavy CPU cooler but also quite
light mine compared to the behemoth that
is the wraith ripper
still deep cool isn't messing around
might sound like it the cooler is named
frozen after all but this is a serious
contender the cooler features a super
thick copper base plate with full TR for
coverage measuring 46 millimeters wide
68 millimeters deep and it's also 15
millimeters thick then extracting heat
from the base we have half a dozen 6
millimeter thick copper heat pipes and
they snake their entire way through the
base plate extending out both sides up
through the fin stack
deep cool says their heat pipes are in a
boot shape and this provides faster heat
dissipation I did notice that some of
the bends are less aggressive than those
of the heat pipes used by the Wraiths
Ripper pushing out over the heat sink is
a 120 millimeter hydro barring fancy
sewing operate between 500 and 1800 rpm
improving the build quality here and
adding a bit of flair at the same time
as an all-aluminium fan frame the frame
looks great it's highly unique and it's
all aluminium construction means it's
extremely durable I really like the
silver textured finish and the embedded
RGB lighting looks impressive as well
speaking of RGB lighting in addition to
the fan frames highlights we also find a
dark tinted top panel and this is
backlit with a light bar and the game of
storm logo the RGB lighting is
addressable and supports or major
motherboard brands such as a soos asrock
MSI and gigabyte anyway the frozen is a
solid looking cooler I'm just not quite
sure how well it's going to stack up
against the much larger Wraith Ripper
but of course that's what we're here to
find out now both of these coolers have
been tested on the msi x 399 creation
motherboard using the thread ripper 2990
WX both stock and overclocked and I will
be reporting the idol and stress
temperatures of both the CPU along with
the motherboards verum which will be fed
err only by the CPU cooler for the
stress test I'll be using a blender
workload which will be running for an
hour at which point I will be reporting
the peak temperature then after a 10
minute cooldown period I will record the
lowest temperature and report that as
the idle result so let's get into the
numbers okay so first that we have these
stock results and very surprisingly
fries and kept the 2990 WX 2 degrees
cooler than the Wraith Reaper in our
stress test and just a degree cooler at
idle now this is an average from three
test runs but even so I would allow for
at least a one degree margin of error
possibly a one to two degree margin of
error also the ambient temperature was
closely monitored at between 21 and 22
degrees anyway under these conditions
it's very clear that both coolers
deliver very similar results and I
should know that the fan speed was fixed
at 1900 rpm for both coolers as I found
the auto fan speed setting on the MSI
extra aggression I did at times skew the
results and the Wraith report was a
it loud when the fan was allowed to spin
up to 2600 rpm also using the auto fan
speeds hitting the fries and cooler spun
its fan it just 1300 to 1400 RPM under
load while the wraith ripper was much
more aggressive as i said going up well
over 2,000 RPM so it wasn't exactly a
fair comparison what I found really
interesting was although the CPU
temperature was very much the same the
difference in varium temp was massive
now this won't necessarily reflect the
kind of performance you'll see on all
motherboards but it is what you'll see
on the msi x3 99 creation assuming no
direct airflow over the verum by any
other means such as a top mounted case
fan for example I believe the wraith
ripper suffers in this test due to its
size the air exiting the cooler is
directed above the verum heatsink as the
cooler overhangs the nearest memory
modules the much narrower frozen cooler
allows the air more room to dissipate
and this provides much more direct
airflow over the verum heatsink as you
can see this had a huge impact on
temperatures laying the verum to operate
11 degrees cooler with frozen again this
may not be the case for all
configurations but on the x3 99 creation
with limited air flow over the
motherboard these are the results we
received both coolers did deliver
excellent CPU temperatures though so
let's move on to see how they handle the
2990 WX overclocked to 4 gigahertz using
1.25 volts with the 2990 WX now
overclocked we see an almost 20%
increase in operating temperature and
surprisingly Verizon is again a few
degrees cooler than the Wraith rip up
here we see just two degrees separates
these air coolers the frozen is clearly
better in our test but the difference is
very small this time we do see much
similar verum temperatures though again
frozen is also better here allowing the
x3 night uncreation around 4 degrees
cooler under load again adding a case
fan to direct airflow over the very room
would probably eliminate this
performance difference but in situations
where the motherboard sees limited air
flow fries and will likely allow for
better performance then finally we have
this unrealistic extreme stress test
we're feeding the 21 90 WX 1 point 4
volts to put maximum load on the CPU
cooler and the VRM this C's frozen and
the Wraith River basically delivering
the same performance frozen was a degree
cooler but that is within our margin of
error there's also just a true degree
difference for the verum 10
for now as well okay so those results I
have to say were very surprising I was
expecting the much bigger and heavier
rain Ripper to dominate Verizon but as
we saw that wasn't the case
I've also recently just got my hands on
a retail version of the Wraiths Ripper
for testing I used the version provided
with my review kit for the twenty nine
nine WX and twenty nine 50 X so I
retested with the retail version just
after finishing all the initial testing
and confirmed that there's no real
changes with this particular version the
base was noticeably smoother for the
retail version but temperatures were
within a degree of what's reported here
I have to say they were getting a retail
version of both these coolers hasn't
exactly been easy
and even today availability is still
very poor for now I think it's safe to
say that performance is very similar
depending on conditions one might come
out a few degrees ahead of the other and
again I should just note that the fans
were locked at a maximum fan speed of
1900 rpm for the tests done in this
video that was just to normalize the
operating volume and limit it to what I
consider to be a tolerable level as I
mentioned earlier in the review on auto
the race Ripper wanted to spin up to
2600 rpm and here it was quite loud
allow them what I would want to live
with at that speed I'd rather just get
an all-in-one liquid cooler which is
actually also cheaper so for testing I
did lock the fan speed for the Wraith
Reaper at 63 percent which saw a peak
temp of 87 degrees in our 1.4 volt
stress test but that full fan speed the
temperature did drop to 78 degrees of
course if we allowed fries in a spin its
fan at full speed you'd also see a
similar drop in temperature so I guess
the only question remaining now is which
cooler should you buy as usual that one
is a little bit difficult to answer as
they both have their individual
strengths but there is one metric that
we can discuss that makes the choice a
whole lot easier and that is of course
the price the $120 us MSRP of the Wraith
Ripper makes it one mighty expensive air
cooler after all the $90 u.s. price for
the frozen and that's not the MSRP
that's the current retail price and that
still makes this cooler very expensive
we just didn't see a little over 30%
more value in the wraith Ripper cooler I
can understand why it costs that
much more to produce but sadly it
doesn't translate into better
performance in a nutshell the advantages
of the Wraiths Ripper include the dead
easy installation process and the beefy
but attractive appearance the advantage
of frozen is that it's more compact and
provides greater compatibility it's
obviously cheaper but performance is
comparable and it's a universal cooler
that can be used on all current AMD and
Intel platforms so that makes it much
more flexible should you change to a
different platform in the future
personally I do prefer the look of the
Wraiths Ripper but be aware it is a
absolutely massive cool if you haven't
noticed already and because of that it
is a bit of a hog it will hide your
motherboard so it does hug the look of
you build somewhat so if you are trying
to build a showy build that shows off
all the components then you may not like
the fact that the cooler hides pretty
much most of the top section on the
motherboard and then of course when you
have a graphics card in that sort of
hides that section of the board so in
the build I did with this cooler you
didn't see much of the MSI X 399
creation but still overall a great
looking cooler really love the RGB
effects even those of you who don't
really like RGB lighting I think you'll
agree that it does look quite good on
this cooler the frozen cooler also looks
great in my opinion but I do prefer the
Wraiths Ripper if I had to pick one of
them purely on looks still a
good-looking cooler
overall though frozen is just a more
sensible product in pretty much every
way it's cheaper performs just as well
it has Universal platform support that's
a really important feature if you decide
to change platforms or whatever you can
keep your rather expensive air cooler
greater compatibility with memory so you
can have taller memory and not have the
heatsink block that and cause problems
for you and it also doesn't block the
primary PCIe slot on most of the X 399
motherboards so taking all that into
consideration I would recommend deep
cools frozen and on a final note coming
up on the channel soon I will be adding
more coolers to the mix so testing more
coolers on the 29th 90 WX to hit them
with a maximum stress test I'll be
adding more air coolers and some
all-in-one liquid coolers as well and
we're doing that in an effort to work
out what is the best value best
performing a cooler for your second
thread ripple workstation for now though
