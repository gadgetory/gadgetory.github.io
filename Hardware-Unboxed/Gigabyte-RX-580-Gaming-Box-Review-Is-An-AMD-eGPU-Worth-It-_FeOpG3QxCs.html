we're looking at another external GPU
which is a topic we've covered a few
times in the past this time we're
reviewing the gigabyte rx5 a league
gaming box which joins the Auris gtx
1070 and GTX 1080 gaming boxes and
gigabytes lineup this is the first time
we've looked at an AMD external GPU
solution so that'll be a bit interesting
and of course I'll be discussing some
performance numbers later in the video
the basic design to the RX 580 gaming
box is effectively identical to
gigabytes other each GPUs it's an
extremely compact housing much more
compact than build yourself a GPU some
companies like razor and it houses
especially built graphics card with a
custom small form-factor cooler
gigabytes a GPUs are ridiculously
compact in comparison to something like
to raise a core or alienware graphics
amplifier and that's why I like them so
much
the other key advantage to the gaming
box is it actually includes a GPU inside
so you don't need to purchase the e GPU
housing and then source your own
graphics card the RX 580 Gaming box is
the cheapest a GPU gigabyte has produced
at 550 US dollars so the enclosure
itself is valued at about 250 when you
consider the cheapest rx 588 gig models
a sudden these days for $300 or so not
as good value as the gtx 1070 or gtex
1080 boxes and there's something I'll
discuss in more detail a bit later but
it's similar to other eg pew enclosures
on the market if you've seen my coverage
on the GTX 10-17 GT X 1080 gaming boxes
you'll be familiar with the overall
design of the RX 580 gaming box
considering gigabyte basically recycled
it the entire chassis is constructed
from industrial metal with two large
vents on either side one provides there
to the GPU and the other to the power
supply the front is a simple metal sheet
with a gigabyte logo on it while the
back includes direct access to the GPU
ports along with a few additional IO
options as this is a mostly standard RX
580 you get three DisplayPort outputs
and one HDMI out directly from the
graphics card in addition the gaming box
gives you three USB 3.0 ports and an
orange quick charge 3.0 USB port all of
which connect through the Thunderbolt 3
cable to your laptop or other device the
Box also of course requires wall power
and will charge your laptop through
Thunderbolt 3
that's supported the boxes internal
layout is simple and taking the unipod
is pretty much a breeze 1/2 is allocated
to the compact GPU and the other to the
power supply to small fans on the psu
side help provide additional airflow
into the case and the PSU itself has a
rear exhaust fan these tiny 25
millimeter fans can be a bit noisy when
idle but during full load it is drowned
out by the graphics card fan the box
isn't especially quiet when fully
utilized but I wouldn't say it's loud
either upgradability though is a pretty
limited affair with the gaming box you
do get two slots worth of space but
length and height a serious concern so
you need to find a super compact mini
ITX style card if you wanted to upgrade
and even then I'm not convinced all
compact cards would fit likely the 450
watt power supply with 80-plus
gold-level efficiency shouldn't present
a power problem if you do want to
upgrade and if you are planning to pull
out the RX 580 from the gaming box to
use in another system again you will
have to be careful the exposed 120
millimeter fan on the cooler extends
well beyond the bottom edge of the
heatsink leaving just a few millimetres
of clearance between the fan blades and
the motherboard most desktop boards
don't really have that sort of clearance
as is the case with most a GPUs on the
market the RX 580 gaming box NYX /
Thunderbolt 3 and the setup process is
extremely straightforward provided your
laptops support Thunderbolt 3 just plug
in the Box it powers itself up then you
simply allow the device to connect when
the Thunderbolt 3 utility pops up and
should begin working a basic set of
drivers is installed automatically -
just like with nvidia gpus from there
the whole process of using the gaming
box is super simple you plug in the box
to your system in the box will
automatically turn on and switch to
using external graphics unplugging the
box it powers down automatically and
switches the system back to its internal
graphics you don't have to switch
anything yourself the entire process
works smoothly and perfectly every
single time however there are some tips
and tricks to get the best performance
out of your eg PU there are two display
options you can choose from either you
can use an external display hooked up
directly to the GPU outputs on a gaming
box or you can let the box pass back a
display signal to your laptops display
if you don't have an external display
hooked up passing the display signal
back to your laptop sucks up some
valuable fundable 3 bandwidth and
noticeably hurts performance so we
always recommend using an external
display for gaming
we tested the system like that also I
don't recommend using the USB ports on
the Gambian box while gaming either as
that too sucks up thunder bot 3
bandwidth and can introduce performance
drops and stuttering you really need to
save every last drop of Thunderbolt 3
bandwidth for the GPU to get the best
performance so stick to using the USB
ports when you're not gaming so let's
talk performance for this review I'm
going to be discussing how the rx 580
gaming box performs in a handful of
games are both 1080p and 1440 pay so you
can get an idea of what sort of
experience to expect I'm not going to be
focusing on comparisons to other gaming
boxes because we already know how the
arts 580 stacks up against the gtx 1070
gtx 1016 so forth just watch some of our
previous coverage if you're interested
in that but of course there are some
limitations to external GPUs that
prevent you from getting desktop class
performance to Thunderbolt 3 bandwidth
and latency are the primary concerns
Thunderbolt 3 latency introduces a
performance penalty to any graphics card
attached to any system so no matter how
fast your CPU or GPU is the e GPU setup
we'll never reach proper desktop level
performance from identical components
while this does hurt performance overall
the latency penalty levels the playing
field among mobile CPUs the difference
in performance between an e GPU attached
to a 15 watt u series laptop and a 45
watt h-series laptop is only a couple of
percent in other words there's little
advantage to using a processor like the
six core core i7 8750 H over the quad
core Core i7
8550 you provided you have a full
full-length Thunderbolt 3 connection at
your disposal it's also important to
note that the latency penalty is not a
true bottleneck of sorts a GTX 1080 EGP
you will still outperform a gtx 1070 EGP
you buy margins roughly similar to those
cards in desktop systems but the
performance of each of those cards is
limited by Thunderbolt 3s latency the
GTX 1080 isn't captor gtx 1070 level
performance instead the latency penalty
caps any cards performance - roughly 80%
of what you get in a desktop system if
you do have a two-lane Thunderbolt 3
device like some older dell XPS laptops
you will be hitting a bandwidth cap on
top of the latency penalty and that
hurts performance by approximately 10%
that's the background information about
a GPU performance that you need to know
for testing the RX
many gaming box I used the gigabyte
arrow 15 X which has a six core core i7
8750 H inside along with 16 gig of ddr4
2666 memory and a four-lane Thunderbolt
3 port at the moment this is pretty much
the best-case laptop test platform for
an e GPU but even if you have a less
powerful laptop like something with an
8th gen you seriously PU you only be
looking at a performance drop of a
couple of percent at worst let's kick
things off by looking at watchdogs 2
performance running at 1080p with the
medium quality preset we're getting
around 50 FPS average and a 37 fps 1%
loge is quite respectable not the best
experience you'll ever see but
definitely playable and if you lift that
up to 1440p you still get around 40 FPS
with a 1% low above 30fps prey on the
other hand is not looking good this is a
game that is heavily impacted by the
latency penalty producing just a 22 FPS
1% low at 1080p with the very high
preset a proper gtx 1060 gaming laptop
pushes well above 60fps 1% low in this
title at the same quality setting so
it's clear the RX 588 GPU is well behind
in this title Middle Earth shadow of war
is the game mode class is quite playable
on the RX 580 gaming box provided you
choose the right quality settings I
tested with the high preset and got a 55
FPS average at 1080p and a 1% low above
30 FPS though to play at 1440p you might
want to turn down a few settings i'm
only going to briefly talk about
Assassin's Creed origins because even
the medium preset at 1080p was
completely unplayable on the RX 5 any
gaming box this game is comfortably
playable in gtx 1060 laptop an Rx 588
GPU unfortunately doesn't cut it Star
Wars Battlefront 2 runs really well on
the RX 580 gaming box we're looking at
60 FPS average at 1080p with ultra
settings and a 1% low of 42 fps you
could quite comfortably plant 1440p if
you want as that drops the average frame
rate down to just 45 FPS while
maintaining a 35 FPS 1% low turn down a
few quality settings at 1440p and
hitting a 60 FPS average is quite easy
battlefield one runs reasonably well
whether you're gaming at 1080p or 1440p
both hit 1% loads above 30 fps and if
you turn down the quality settings from
ultra you can get a decent experience
here though the game is less playable an
actual
see player barrels the final two games
we have are dirt four which is not the
title that gets absolutely obliterated
by the latency penalty with way lower
than expected performance for this GPU
and far cry 5 which runs really well
even using the ultra preset in Far Cry 5
I was able to hit a 42 FPS average with
a tight 35 FPS 1% low and that was only
reduced marginally when gaming at 1440p
so there aren't too many surprises in
regards to how the aurochs 580 gaming
box performs it can transform a laptop
with weak integrated graphics or an
entry-level discrete GPU like the MX 150
into a decent-enough 1080p gaming
machine provided you are willing to game
at mid tier quality settings at around
60 fps or lower in some situations it
might also be good for 1440p gaming
considering the performance penalty
moving from 1080p to 1440p is a
surprisingly low 15 to 20 percent but as
with a lot of external GPUs there are
many things to consider the RX 5 many
gaming box when hooked up to even a core
i7
8750 H is nowhere near as fast as a
proper gtx 1060 or rx 580 gaming laptop
you're looking at upwards of 40% more
performance from a GTX 1060 laptop if
not double the performance in latency
impacted titles the cheapest gtx 1060
laptops around a thousand bucks these
days and that's a full system it's not
just an a GPU the closest performing
system to the RX 580 gaming box is a
laptop with the gtx 1050 or gtx 750ti
inside so it only really makes sense to
get the arcs 580 gaming box if your
existing system has worse than 1050
level graphics we're talking MX 150 or
integrated graphics here which makes the
RX 580 gaming box an upgrade on just the
most basic laptop solutions and even
then I probably wouldn't recommend it
the gtx 1070 gaming box also from
gigabyte it's just $50 more than the rx
580 model yet it includes a GPU that's
currently $200 more expensive on the
standalone market that's much better
value because for just 10 percent more
money you can expect at least 30% more
performance plus of course for a lot of
users that just want a system capable of
gaming it makes more sense to go out and
buy an entire gaming PC a GPUs is still
a pretty niche product I think they will
remain in that category until we see a
better interface and Thunderbolt 3 come
along so we can not get that latency
penalty anymore I could see the rx 580
gaming box be a useful purchase for Mac
owners is this a GPU does support Mac's
whereas invidious a GPS is not
officially supported but for most other
buyers looking at an external graphics
box for gaming with a Windows machine I
would point you towards to the gtx 1070
gaming box instead that's it for this
