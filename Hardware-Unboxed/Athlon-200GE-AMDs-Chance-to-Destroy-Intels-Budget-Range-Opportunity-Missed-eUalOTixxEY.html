talking budget hardware as ambien ounces
the Athlon 200 GE but before you make a
fist-sized hole in your desk or whatever
it is you happen to have in front of you
relax this isn't another bulldozer
abomination that's found its way to the
a m4 platform know what we have here is
an Athlon brenards n+ process with
Radeon Vega graphics so I guess it's an
APU I don't think AMD is using the term
APU anymore which is annoying because I
think we oughta matically called any AMD
CPU with integrated graphics an APU but
anyway if you recall we receive the
first Zen based APIs back in February of
this year with the rice and 320 200 G
and Rison 520 400 G and those are priced
at a hundred u.s. and 170 dollars u.s.
respectively these CPUs packed Vega
graphics the 2200 G featured the Vega 8
GPU with 8 graphics compute units
enabled and the 2400 G had Vega 11 with
surprise-surprise 11 graphics compute
units both offered entry level type
discrete graphics performance so for CPU
and GPU with a configurable TDP of 45 to
65 watts the performance was pretty
impressive still while a bargain at $100
u.s. the 2200 G was still out of range
for some more as crazy as it might sound
a bit excessive plenty of people still
interested in say Intel Celeron and
Pentium processors priced between $40
and $100 u.s. not that long ago we
checked out the pentium g
5400 and at the time it cost $52 us
today it's a bit worse value at more
like $70 u.s. though assuming the $52
u.s. price Steve's conclusion regarding
the G 5400 went something like this if
you're not interested in 3d performance
and you just want a PC for general usage
then the Pentium G 5400 is tough to be
that said if you plan to tackle heavy
tasks like rendering and coding and so
on then the extra investment is well
worth it if the 2200 she was often up to
40% faster still the 2200 she clearly
couldn't cater to everyone and at some
point AMD would need to create a Zen
base to sub a hundred or us process and
today we
have that processor the Athlon 200 GE
but why Athlon you might ask well Ambu
like Intel doesn't want to risk
tarnishing their premium product lines
with budget low performance products so
Intel preserves the core name for their
higher-end parts and goes with Pentium
and Celeron for the ultra affordable
models
ambi is doing the same by making their
ultra affordable Zen processors part of
the Athlon family today just a single
Athlon model will be announced and it
packs in mere two cores and for threats
thanks to SMT being enabled it runs at a
frequency of just 3.2 gigahertz and this
relatively low frequency allows army to
achieve the 35 watt TDP rating that's
great no but what really sucks e is the
fact that this is a locked CPU yep I'm
sorry to say but for whatever reason
Andy has gone a bit full intel on us
here initially I was pretty excited
about this new budget processor but the
second I found out the CPU cores were
locked I felt a bit crushed and most of
the excitement was gone
you can still overclock the ddr4 memory
to help maximize the GPU performance but
still no CPU core overclocking speaking
of the integrated GPU it packs just
three graphics compute units which is
very light when compared to the risin AP
use down 63% from the 2200 G so I'm not
expecting much that said AMD are
claiming some pretty decent 720p gaming
numbers 65 FPS in dota 2 71 fps and csgo
67 FPS in rocket League and roughly 60
fps in overwatch so I'm keen to check it
out later this month now you might be
thinking a dual-core get the hell out of
here AMD but a dual-core Rison processor
with SMT support will be more than
capable of delivering smooth performance
in a number of popular titles such as
those just mentioned also we probably
shouldn't overlook the fact that it
comes in an MSRP of just $55 us so throw
it on a $50 a320 board and you've got
yourself a pretty great budget combo I
should also note that it's compatible
with the full range of a m4 motherboard
so in addition to the a320 boards you
can also use it with b3 or 50 X 370 P
450 and X 470 boards and Andy says no
BIOS update is required for any of these
boards in terms of general computing
performance
dee has shown it delivering pentium g
4560 like performance those underwear
the G 4560 is a 2017 release based on
the 14 nanometer Kaiba Lake architecture
it also packs 2 cores with Smt
technology for 4 threads and a base
frequency of 3.5 gigahertz I'm not sure
why AMD didn't compare it to a modern
equivalent that you can actually buy the
pentium g 5400 for example is the same
processor at the g 45 60 it just comes
clocked 6 percent higher which is
probably why md chose the g 45 60 as the
200 GE can match that chip had the 200 g
been an unlocked part it would have I
guess single-handedly smokes the entire
Intel Celeron and Pentium range as it
stands now it probably only makes sense
if you want to take advantage of the
integrated GPU if you plan on getting a
discrete GPU of any kind the Pentium
processors from Intel likely offer a
little more bang for your buck I will
say that unlike the horrid time for
bulldozer APU series which made about as
much sense as the cabling x-series is a
CPU placeholder the AMD 200 GE does make
for an excellent place all day if you
happen across a decent be 350 board for
a good price you can throw the 200 GE on
it and enjoy some casual gaming now and
then later once funds allow you to
upgrade to a more serious rising 5 all
rise the 7 CPU you can do so with ease
today AMD are just announcing the Athlon
200 G normally these budget chips get
pushed out quietly but for whatever
reason AMD is making a bit of noise 12
days ahead of the actual release Steve
is definitely keen to try and provide a
review on the 18th of September and see
how well the Tour de GE stacks up
against the IntelliJ 5400 had only
offered this as an unlocked part I would
have been super excited but as it stands
I'm worried I'll end up being a little
bit disappointing I mean it's never
gonna be bad at just $55 you Wes but a
$55 unlocked for threaded Zen + CP you
would have conquered every sub $100
Intel CPU with ease and I guess what
could have been anyway
