point 0 architecture in January of 2013
in the form of the radeon HD 7970 they
well and truly put him video on the back
foot the 7970 had little trouble
manhandling the gtx 580 and although
it's just two months until the gtx 680
arrive i'm sure that was a very long
wait for him video fast forward four
years and we find a similar situation
though this time it's AMD who's on the
back foot with the gtx 1080 due to go on
sale this month followed by the 1070
next month it'll be interesting to see
how AMD responds making this round of
GPU wars even more interesting is the
change in strategy Nvidia opted to come
out guns blazing as they so often do
introducing high-end parts first with
the option to fill in the lower tier
gaps later of course we know there are
still bigger Pascal diets to come but
that won't be until late next year AMD
on the other hand is opted for a
different strategy one that sees them
released they're more affordable Polaris
GPUs first based on current information
that we to pull our cpus + 10 + + 11 and
neither will be focused on the high-end
desktop graphics market plus 11 is
targeting low-power market to think our
70 to 80 x + + 10 will go after the
mainstream to higher market so 380 x
territory so why is AMD taking this
approach and broken tradition my
theories they've had trouble or at least
predicted problems with yields due to
the move to the 14 nanometer FinFET
process to counter any potential issues
that led with their small less complex
products allowing the process to mature
in time for the big guns anyway that's
just my theory whatever the case the
result being that AMD will be offering
the more affordable mainstream GPUs out
of the gate this means Polaris will be
competing with the last gen and video
maxwell products at least in the short
term a situation which AMD is no doubt
hoping will result in meaningful market
share gains originally this meant that
aimed his answer to the geforce gtx 1080
and 1070 wouldn't come until next year
but with the arrival dates of these new
nvidia gpus set in concrete AMD has
reportedly brought their high-end GPUs
codeine vega forward to october of this
year
this is of course all speculations let's
focus on the here and now with AMD
seemingly without an answer to the gtx
1080 and 1070 for at least five months
they'll have to rely on their Fiji and
Granada products in the meantime so in
order for amd's current product stack to
remain competitive what kind of pricing
can game is expect based on the 1080
performance that we've seen and the 1070
performance that we expect the pricing
landscape should look something like
this the fury axe was an average thirty
percent slower at 4k and thirty-six
percent slower at 1440p based on my 21
game test sample therefore I believe
this knocks the fury axe down at least
24 hundred and fifty dollars in order
for it to remain competitive at this
price that delivers a similar cost per
frame with the disadvantage of greater
power consumption the fury and nano then
follow suit the Nano priced alongside
the fury X once again with the stand of
fury hitting four hundred dollars the
390 X as it stands is a pretty poor
option in terms of value thanks to the
much cheaper and not a great deal slower
390 I see at least a seventeen percent
reduction in asking price for the 3 90 x
to three hundred and fifty dollars but
if AMD wants to be really aggressive
they might push closer to 300 finally
the 390 probably won't see any price
Corrections is it's still great value of
three hundred dollars 390 is less of a
concern as it could be replaced shortly
is certainly much faster than the higher
and cards the real focus here for me is
on the Fiji based GPUs as they'll be
crucial in taking the fight to win video
over the coming months so tell me what
do you guys think do you agree with my
pricing estimates or do you think I'm
well off base let me have it in the
comments i'm your host man as always and
i'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
