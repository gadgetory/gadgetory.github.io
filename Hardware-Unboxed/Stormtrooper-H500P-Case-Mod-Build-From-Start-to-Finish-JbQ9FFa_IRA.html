have another build from Alex of simple
mods this time he will be turning the
master case H 500 P mesh white edition
into a star wars-themed dream PC so
stick around if you want to see the
entire process from start to finish and
with that I'll hand it over to Alex hey
what's up guys Alex here and I'm happy
to be back with yet another case mode
time-lapse video following the recent
dual cosmos sees how Andrew P builds so
we hope you guys enjoyed these videos
and the custom builds as well so in this
video I want to show you my stormtrooper
inspired cooler master master case H 500
p case mode that was also at IM sydney
last month and this is the mesh white
edition of the case so it's had some
improvements from the original but the
main thing is that it comes in white and
the front is now mesh so it's a proper
high airflow case I guess I've actually
done a case mod in the original H 500 P
that was also a star wars-themed build
inspired by the Jedi Order Titanic speed
graphics card which was actually
featured on NVIDIA GeForce garage so
that was pretty cool dobe link to that
in the description if you guys want to
check it out and also more videos on
this build on my channel now the H 500 P
looks pretty great in white I think and
was perfect for a stormtrooper theme to
which I've also added some dead star
elements such as the covers on the PSU
shroud inside the build and also on the
outside of the case trying to mimic the
outside of the dead star and I've also
spray-painted a stormtrooper helmet on
to the front panel mesh I cut the top of
the hard drive cages of the hard drives
I've ever seen and also the inside of
the front panel fan mountings as having
built in this case in the past if you
want to put a 360 millimetre radiator on
the outside of the front panel with fans
on the inside of the case the fan blades
can actually hit the inside of the frame
so I simply cut some of it out I learned
this the hard way with the other build
unfortunately but just with those
sections cut out from there I'm having
no issues with this configuration but
the cool thing about having the radiator
here is that you can mount the 120
millimeter fans on the inside and then
you can also mount the included massive
200 millimeter RGB fans which look
pretty awesome so you can mount this
over the radiator on the outside you can
still have the 200 millimeter RGB fans
trying
through the front of the case keeping in
mind you only really be able to do this
with a 30 Milotic radiator or you can
force a bigger one in there like I did
in the Jedi Order H 500 P case mug for
the rest of the specs there's an Intel
Core i7 78 20 X CPU on the ISIS prime X
299 deluxe motherboard with 32 gigs of a
pacer Panther at 32 hundred megahertz
ddr4 ram and asus rog Strix GT X 1080
graphics card a 512 gigabyte Intel 760
PM dot 2 SSD as the OS drive a 2
terabyte Seagate Barracuda sshd and a 6
terabyte Seagate Barracuda pro hard
drive this is all being powered by a
cooler master v1000 power supply with
custom cable more pro cables which I've
added some gold color to hinting at a
stand through / which actually gives to
build a nice color contrast combined
with the gold bits on the bits power
fittings as well and with the rest of
the water cooling Hardware being
exclusively from bits power I've also
used the crimson red premature via
coolant which fortunately hasn't given
me much issues so far like the blue view
did in the other build but all most
likely I have to change this out at some
point as well so I hope you guys liked
the finished build enjoy the time-lapse
video and I'll see you in the next one
Cheers
you
you
another fantastic looking build there
