very first season of upgrade my PC
please if you missed episode 1 or the
video explaining what the series is all
about then be sure to check those out
I'll link them in the video description
below so on last week's episode we had
the first 5 pcs all in need of various
upgrades and you the viewers voted
Hayden's CAD box the most worthy of
receiving the proposed upgrades the
voting was seriously close and
shockingly the CAD box beat Dakota's
Silver Shadow by a single vote just one
vote that's pretty harsh and I really
wish we could afford to offer Dakota an
upgrade package as well sadly though we
are stretching the budget as it is for
now still Dakota won't be walking away
empty-handed and neither will the other
three contestants as all four runners-up
will be receiving a Rainbow six siege
game code from Ubisoft speaking of
Rainbow six siege make sure you tune in
to the APAC pro league from september
12th to see the top siege teams and E&amp;amp;Z
take on the best teams in Asia I'll
provide the link in the video
description so you can watch the live
stream 2 matches as for Hayden we'll be
ordering his new parts from PC kaske and
they'll be sent out this week PC case
key put their hand up right away to
support the series and offer free
shipping for all the Australian based
contestants so a big thanks to them also
once Hayden's installed all the shiny
new hardware in thuy system I'll get him
to provide us some updated photos of the
refurbish rig and then I'll show them
off to you guys in a special feature at
the start of next season also don't
forget to vote each week as that will
place you in the running to win some
cool prizes and those will be global
giveaways although we can't afford to
expand the upgrade Series globally just
yet we can still offer you the chance to
win some very cool gear no matter where
you are
speaking of which later on the video we
do have a Seagate Barracuda 4 terabyte
hard drive to give away thanks to
Seagate that will be going to one lucky
winner who voted on last week's episode
so if you did indeed vote make sure you
stick around for that all right so once
again we have 5 pcs all in either
various upgrades so let's go check them
out
it's amazing how much of a statement a
case can make the graphite series 320 T
comes in one of two options black which
is pretty typical or what Corsair calls
rebel orange and this is the option ryan
chose i have to say
a very nice choice where I am built the
system from the ground up and it began
life with an F X 4100 four gigabytes of
RAM and the Radeon HD 7770 the pcs been
named Dortmunder after the first
Alliance Cruiser showcase in episode 1
our Firefly Ryan's favorite sci-fi
series to him I also loved that series
it died far too young it still hurts
even today and it was something like 14
years ago man do I feel old anyway today
Ryan's PC packs a slightly more powerful
FX 8350 along with the r9 270x which is
a pretty big step up from the 7770
there's also sixteen gigabytes of ddr3
which is a shame as we weren't actually
proud to carry that over to any modern
platform as you can probably tell from
the case where I enjoy his doom but he
also likes to play csgo and pub G
neither of which play particularly well
on an FX series CPU getting right into
it this is what I proposed since Ryan
has used a lot of a MIDI Harper in the
past and right now in terms of value
rise it represents the most bang for
your buck I've decided on the horizon 3
1200 for the games Ryan wants to play in
the class of GPU were upgrading to I
think rise and 3 makes a lot of sense
here and it can of course be upgraded
down the track then filling out that mid
Tower is the MSI be 350 gaming plus with
8 gigabytes of memory and with four dimm
slots not offer here it can be easily
upgraded in the future then finally the
GTX 10 63 gigabyte will take things to
the next level and push frame rates over
60fps at 1080p for a nice smooth
experience at all the latest titles
fellow Aussie Braden is rocking along
with only me cold and medium PC from his
sister many years ago the only upgrade
made since receiving the PC includes a
gtx 660 and a larger 500 gigabyte hard
drive short of that though brayton
hasn't had the funds for any big
upgrades it sounds like Braden does a
little bit of work in light works but
mostly likes to play games such as
rocket League overwatch and csgo and
while very fun popular games I assume
they're mostly played out of necessity
as they aren't the most demanding titles
right so for our younger viewers out
there the Core 2 Duo e 80s
six-hundred was a high-end flagship
dual-core processor released way back in
2008 by Intel and at the time it was a
bit special today though it runs rocket
League like bicycle League and no matter
how hard at pedals with just 2 gigabytes
of RAM it's going to be a jerky ride
because we're coming from so far back
I'm gonna recommend the pentium g 45 64
this one opposed to rise and 3 in terms
of pricing it's much the same but we're
going about things a little differently
for this one now you might be confused
by the relatively high end Zed 270 boy
from asrock but the idea here is to
provide Braden with a set of components
that will allow him to make further
upgrades in the future dropping in a
Core i5 or a core i7 perhaps down the
track will give this system a new lease
on life
meanwhile the GTX 1050 is a massive
upgrade from the gtx 660 and that pretty
much goes without saying
and finally the thought of Braden
running this newly refurbished system on
an old 500 gigabyte hard drive was just
too much for me so we're putting down
the angle grinder and getting out
Kingston's a 400 which will make for a
super snappy boot drive with this
upgrade Braden can certainly enjoy some
new games can you feel the force
well Daniel can and it's extremely weak
but still very power hungry
the Phenom 2 was AMD's last-ditch effort
before it all went horribly wrong for
almost a decade now all those years lost
anyway built back in 2008 Daniel has
persevered never losing faith in the
force though he has made a few upgrades
along the way the GTX 760 is one of the
newer additions and the system has
gained a few case fans along the way
Daniel mostly uses the PC for gaming and
he likes to play pub G but I mean who
doesn't
am i right along with that he also does
like to play Mass Effect Andromeda and
warframe having to play those tunnels on
this PC would be enough to send anyone
to the dark side as David as the core
hardware is the system itself is
actually very neat and tidy and I really
like the case power supply and storage
they're all very respectable speaking of
storage a PCI Express adapter card had
to be installed in order to take full
advantage of the SSDs as the motherboard
only supports soldered devices with a
three gigabit
a second throughput and not the six
gigabits per second that's required he
also tells me that the graphics card
blocked most of the SATA ports on the
board because they're not mounted at a
90 degree angle so to stop Daniel going
rogue I proposed the same rise and three
upgrade option that we've already
explored this means dropping in the
horizon three 1200 on the MSI be 350
going + along with eight gigabytes of
ddr4 memory then tackling the games will
be the GeForce GTX 10 63 gigabyte and
since Daniel only games at 1080p this
graphics card will be more than
sufficient and then finally if Daniel
can get his hands on the a m4 adapter
for that 212 Evo then I suggest doing so
as that will allow him to use that over
the AMD Wraith stealth box cooler okay
so this cute little computer
affectionately named Reggie has a
seriously long backstory so I'll try and
summarize it as best and quickly as I
can
basically Reggie comes from humble
beginnings with an Athlon 64 x2
processor after a very long wait Dom
eventually upgraded Reggie with a phenom
2 X 6 1045 but the asou smother bullet
through a problem after problem and
after going through the RMA process not
once but twice Dom was forced into an
emergency upgrade and that ends up being
what you see here so more of a downgrade
than an upgrade he went with the super
budget orientated Athlon 5350 and that
is on the am-1 platform this isn't
really a gaming PC though rather its
primary role is video work and Dom's
dream was to get a rise and CPU in there
and has been saving to make this happen
so once again converting our 500 u.s.
budget into pounds we end up with 390
pounds to play with since gaming isn't
the priority here and when Dom does game
he only plays rocket League on overwatch
and both of which play quite fine in an
rx 550 using mild quality settings so
we're throwing everything at the CPU
here to speed up the video encoding and
the best option is of course the risin 5
1600 since Reggie is built inside the
cute little element gaming atomic Mini
ITX case we've gone with the gigabyte a
B 350 end gaming Wi-Fi motherboard with
8 gigabytes of memory down the track
though Don might want to sell that a
gigabytes of ddr4 replace it with a 16
gigabyte kit but funny how the rendering
times will be slashed dramatically even
with 8 gigabytes
Gramps looks to be on its last legs and
surprisingly Kelvin is reporting pretty
bad stuttering in games such as Rainbow
six siege Just Cause 3 and more recently
the destiny to beta Kelvin was gifted
this system many years ago by his uncle
and has done his best to keep it running
ever since
upgrades have included the geforce gtx
1066 gigabyte graphics card samsung SSD
and the coolermaster v 750 power supply
we don't need a new graphics card for
this rig as calvin has recently saved up
and invested in a shiny new geforce gtx
1060 and he now also has a nice SSD a
decent case and power supply so really
we're going to dump the entire budget
into the platform this open siz up to
the rising v 1600 on the asrock be 350
motherboard with a gigabytes of ddr4
memory Kelvin does say he's very keen to
give rise and overclocking a shot so I
propose we throw in the deep cooled game
ax 400 it's a very cost-effective air
cooler and it should allow us to hit
full gigahertz should the processor be
good for it then finally the upgrade
from the Core 2 quad q 9300 to the
horizon 5 1600 is massive should Kelvin
win the upgrade package he won't know
himself all right guys there's 5
potatoes all in need of a good
old-fashioned overhaul your job is to
let us know which one you think is most
deserving of receiving our proposed
upgrade package to cast your vote please
follow the link in the video description
that'll head you over to the textbook
forums by signing up to the forums
commenting and voting you go on the
running to win some cool prizes and that
will be a global giveaway for the
viewers speaking of which the winner
from last week's episode is ET 3d from
Israel congratulations mate you have an
awesome 4 terabyte barratry 2 hard drive
from Seagate coming your way for now
there are only people in select regions
can into their PC for the upgrade my PC
please series remember we're paying for
all of this out of our own back pocket
without the aid of sponsors it's very
costly and not that easy to put together
we hope to expand this series into more
regions in the future but for now at
least you can still get involved by
voting and that will give you the chance
to win some cool gear so far in my
opinion we are off to a very good start
in this episode alone we've given away a
$500 us upgrade package for copies of
Rainbow six siege and a Seagate
Barracuda 4 terabyte hard drive
not bad indeed finally voting will be
open till Friday night in the US and
that's Saturday arvo for those of you
here in Australia I'll then announce the
winner from this episode on next week's
episode which will be Tuesday at 5 p.m.
local time here in Australia and at that
point we'll have another 5 pcs to check
out we'll do it all over again I'm your
host Steve go get voting
