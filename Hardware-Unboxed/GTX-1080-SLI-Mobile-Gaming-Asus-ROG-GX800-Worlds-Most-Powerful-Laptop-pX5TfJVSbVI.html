absolute crap
pretty sure I've just got a flu virus
but I've not been sleeping and I feel
like death anyway last week I was
honored to be invited along to NVIDIA
GeForce a PAC editors day in Bangkok I
was very intrigued as to what it was
Nvidia had to show us in the end it
turned out to be a few familiar friends
repurposed for a different form factor
and video has taken their current
GeForce 10 series lineup - the Titan X
and focus it towards mobile gaming
however unlike previous generations the
m' postfix has been dropped from the
name this has been done because like the
GTX 980 which was relaunched late last
year for notebook users the new Pascal
based geforce cards share the same
specifications as the desktop variants
both the gtx 1060 and GT x 1080 are
identical GPUs to the desktop models
though they do operate at slightly lower
frequencies that said depending on the
laptop design it is possible to boost
the frequency up to and even beyond the
founders edition cards the gtx 1070 is
actually a beefier GPU in its mobile
form boasting an additional 128 CUDA
cores to help overcome the frequency
deficit and video has suggested that the
mobile versions of these GPUs would be
around 10% slower than the desktop
models which is amazing news for mobile
gamers previously we found that the gtx
980m was around 20% to 30% slower than
the desktop model that was often the
difference between achieving and not
achieving 60fps at 1080p this time
things are different much different a
base-model gaming laptop configured with
the gtx 1060 will match what was
previously flagship level mobile gaming
performance meanwhile those armed with
the gtx 1070 or 1080 will slaughter
anything previously available
video says this is all possible thanks
to the extreme efficiency of their
Pascal architecture at this point though
Nvidia hardly needs to hype the product
any further
already taking up the call they have a
dozen laptop manufacturers producing
over 100 different models that means
finding a geforce 10 series enabled
gaming laptop won't be an issue and
today i've managed to find the most
extreme of them all the asus rog GX 800
and holy crap is it something else
this video won't be a typical laptop
review where we test battery life and
cover all the nitty-gritty stuff like
audio quality and held out the speakers
are
instead the focus is solely on
performance namely GPU performance GX
800 doesn't just feed to one new GT X
1080 GPU but rather two for the mobile
4k SLI action not just that but like the
GX 700 before it which featured just a
single GTX 980 the GX 800 is also liquid
cooled when connected to a special
docking station the specs are mighty
impressive though as I just said for
this video I'm going to be focusing more
on the performance of those GT X 1080
GPUs than the laptop itself for
comparison we'll be using the core i7
6700k test system which is clocked and
locked at 4.5 gigahertz what we'll be
looking at is how well the GX 810 80s
compared to the desktop models simply
testing a single configuration for the
GX 800 wasn't going to cover it in the
end we felt it was necessary to test at
least 5 different configurations here's
a table that lists how each
configuration will be labeled on the
graphs and what exactly the test
parameters were due to the fact that the
GX 800 can be air or liquid cooled meant
that already we had to test both cooling
options there's also an XMP overclocking
option which can boost the performance
at a click of a button and should help
the GX 800 deliver desktop life
performance so obviously also wanted to
test that was also important to test
with SLI disabled especially given the
GX 800 performs better with SLI disabled
when not connected to the liquid-cooled
dot removed from the dock there simply
isn't enough power being delivered to
the laptop for the SLI configuration
that I prayed correctly so performance
takes a rather large hit in total ten
games have been tested though in an
effort to keep the video as short as
possible while including all the
relevant info I picked up four games to
discuss the rest of the graphs can be
found on the hardware unbox website the
link for which can be found in the video
description keeping all that in mind
let's move on to the benchmarks
first let's look at the single GC X 1080
desktop performance here we see an
average of 43 FPS disabling sli on the
GX 800 we found the exact same 43 FPS
average with the laptop both liquid and
air-cooled though keep in mind we were
using the XMP settings still this is an
incredible result and so far it looks
like mobile gamers can enjoy desktop
like performance something I found odd
was the fact that with SLI enabled the
performance dropped massively down to
just 34 fps at first I thought SLI must
have been broken or some kind of driver
issue however the desktop systems bad
very smooth 65 FPS so something was up
then occurred to me that the
liquid-cooled docking station features
another 230 watt power supply the SLR
setup was running into a power problem
connected to the dock the average frame
rate jumped up to 60 fps and while that
is a nice result at 4k and meant that
SLI was scaling by this 40% even on the
desktop we only saw scaling reached 51%
though we were able to get close to this
figure using the XMP settings moving to
The Witcher 3 we find much better SLI
scaling and now the GX 800 is capable of
matching even beating the desktop system
with an average of 69 FPS with the XMP
settings with SLI disabled we saw
similar performance to that of a single
GTX 1080 and again using SLI without the
dock connected provided very poor
performance this makes the GX 800 rather
impractical is users will want to make
sure they've manually disabled SLI when
running without the extra power from the
dock this time we find that with SLI
disabled the GX 800 isn't quite able to
match a single GTX 1080 on the desktop
still with an average of 37 fps on air
the GX 800 was comfortably faster than
the desktop gtx 1070 configuration again
enabling sli while on air was a bad
choice as the lack of power meant the
laptop was actually slower with our
slain abled in its out-of-the-box
configuration the GX 800 average 70 FPS
with a minimum of 62 FPS when connected
to the dock using the XMP settings
boosted performance to that of the
desktop 1080 SLI configuration which was
great to see testing with rise of the
Tomb Raider we see that with or without
the liquid-cooled dock the GX 800 is
comparable to our core i7 desktop test
system this is true for both the single
GC X 1080 and our solo configurations
again the only issue here can be seen
when using the GX 800 without the dock
with SLI enabled it will be important
for G X 800 owners to manually disable
SLI when it is impossible to connect up
the dock for that extra power before
wrapping things up let's check out some
temperature results at idle the GX 800
ran cool regardless of the configuration
air cooled the GPU is idle at 41 degrees
in the car 7 CPU at 40 degrees using
liquid cooling dock the CPU temp down at
35 degrees and the GPUs down to 37
degrees under full load is where the
liquid cooled dock makes all
the difference using only the fans the
GX 800 allowed the GPUs to reach 88
degrees while the CPU also operated 88
degrees disabling SLI didn't really help
to reduce the temperatures though the
fans weren't quite as loud using the
liquid cooled dock the CPU only dropped
down to 81 degrees but the GPUs were now
operating at just 61 degrees perhaps the
biggest difference here was the
operating volumes the GX 800 was near
silent even when gaming at no point at
the GTX 1080s inside the GX 800 drop
below 1.7 gigahertz and when liquid
cooled a 2 gigahertz operating frequency
for the sli cards were sustained
although the acyl are configuration
maintained a 1.9 gigahertz operating
frequency when on air the resulting
performance is very weak this at first
doesn't seem to make much sense as both
GPUs are operating at a very high
frequency the issue here is the power
target as the entire system is being fed
just 230 watts and that's simply isn't
enough for 210 ATS to deliver maximum
performance therefore they were limited
to 54 fps in fact disabling 110 ATS saw
the frame rate increase to 63 fps well
there you have it the world's most
powerful gaming laptop the isuzu sorry
GG X 800 is without question an awesome
gaming laptop still I can't help but
feel it's over-the-top very over-the-top
to the point where it's just too
impractical ACS it seems don't totally
disagree with me in fact they such
claims they don't create products for
everyone and with this particular
product they didn't want to compromise
the goal for the GX 800 is simple to
create the best fastest and most extreme
gaming laptop on the planet I can safely
say mission accomplished ensured a su
says products like the GX 800 valve not
because they make sense most people and
not because everybody will want one
instead they do it because it pushes the
technology and themselves to the limit
asus has a lot of passion for creating
these kinds of products and they get a
great deal of pride out of it keeping in
mind that this product is still in the
prototype phase I'm mostly impressed
with GX 800 delivered it is worth noting
that without the liquid cooling dot game
is a best off disable SLI making do with
the single GTX 1080
this does make the 4k display somewhat
overkill and gamers will be best off
lowering the resolution to 1440p for
example
personally I still don't get the point
of having 3840 by 2160 pixels on an 18
point 4 inch screen especially when you
need two extremely powerful current
generation GPUs to achieve 60fps
performance and the latest and greatest
titles I guess this is all part of the
no compromise strategy I should point
out that this custom IPS display does
feature J sync support though for now
this feature isn't working as the
current display firmware is yet to
support G sync with that said I feel a
single GT X 1080 u running at a 1440p
will be the perfect mobile gaming
solution the fact that the GX 800 really
requires the doc into massive 330 watt
power bricks makes it more of a desktop
than laptop in my opinion a soos will no
doubt offer a number of impressive
single GPU GeForce 10 series laptops so
we can't exactly cut them down for
trying something different with GX 800
looking past this extreme and
over-the-top Asus implementation it was
great to see that for the most part a
single GT X 1080 delivers much the same
performance inside a laptop as it does
in the desktop PC this is big news for
mobile gamers previously paying a huge
price premium for 20 to 30% less
performance has made gaming laptops in
my opinion pretty pointless the fact
that you can now receive desktop like
performance helps to justify the
investment I'm particularly interested
to see what kind of prices the GTX 1060
models go on sale for thanks for joining
