corner we are back from Computex
hopefully you've already caught up with
steve's unboxing boxes episode yesterday
and today we're back into the usual
schedule of news corner you'll also
notice the set behind me is pretty much
back to normal if you want to see the
behind-the-scenes process to get that
all done
check out our boxing boxes series
exclusive to our patreon members even
though Computex has just happened where
we saw a ton of announcements there has
still been some interesting new stories
to emerge this week including a ton of
AMD related stuff so let's get into it
as part of apple's quite funny cheese
grater presentation at WWDC earlier this
week where we got such gems as a $1,000
monitor stand AMD announced new
professional-grade graphics cards in the
form of the Radeon Pro Vega 2 and Radeon
Pro Vega 2 juror as we've said countless
times we don't really cover professional
GPUs all that much but this launch does
have something a bit special about it
we'll start with the pro Vega 2 though
as expected we're getting a 7 nanometre
Vega 20 GPU inside but unlike with the
consumer-focused Radeon 7 the pro Vega 2
delivers a fully unlocked cheep you with
4096 stream processors clocked at 17 20
megahertz providing around 14.1
teraflops of compute performance higher
than the 13.4 teraflops you get with the
Radeon 700 of importance to creators is
the increase in HBM to vram from 16
gigabytes to 32 gigabytes which makes it
a bit of a beast for some professional
workloads of great interest is the pro
Vega 2 duo which is the first dual GPU
graphics card from aim being quite some
time it's basically two pro Vega two
GPUs on the one board with an infinity
fabric link between the two providing 84
gigabytes per second data transfers for
better interoperability and memory
access with the same stream process
account and the same boost clock as the
pro Vega to the jury delivers up to 20
8.2 teraflops of performance from a
single board the board itself does look
a little strange AMD has included a
standard PCI year 16 times
but in addition to that is an all-new
PCIe connector that supports up to 475
watts of power delivery this means there
is no external power connect on the
board it all runs through the
motherboard an interesting solution that
no doubt is all about apples proprietary
internal design for the mac pro while
the single GPU version of this card
should be available to the general
public at some point the Radeon pro Vega
- duro is exclusive to the Mac Pro AMD
and apple of work together closely for
many years now on projects like this and
with Apple placing a big emphasis on
compactness and sleek form factors it's
not too surprising the company is still
on board with dual GPU graphics cards if
Andy did offer this car to others it
probably would sell I guess a few units
here and there but among system builders
do GPU cards are well out of favor how
much will it cost to buy a Vega 2 duo
well that's still unclear the Mac Pro
starts at a whopping six thousand US
dollars but you're not getting a dual
GPU solution at that price it's even
hard to guess what price sounds right
$20,000 $30,000 I really don't know what
I do know is some Mac Pro configurations
even come with 4 GPU so likely two of
these Vega 2 duo cards so that's some
pretty serious compute capabilities and
another interesting partnership AMD will
be licensing out some radeon GPU IP to
Samsung for using their mobile GPUs
Ami's press release on the matter
specifically references licensing custom
graphics IP based on the recently
announced highly scalable rDNA graphics
architecture Samsung will of course pay
license fees and royalties for the
privilege as an antique notes Samsung
has been working on their own mobile GPU
for around seven years now that GPU has
only featured in test chips Samsung's
own Exynos CPUs have typically used
third-party GPS but this new deal could
signify the start of Samsung using an R
DNA based GPU or at least a partially
rDNA GPU for their mobile chips knowing
how long it takes to develop a GPU it's
unclear how long Samsung has been
working with AMD to utilize our DNA or
how long it'll take for that tech to
come in to their actual GPU products
it's also possible that Samsung is
merely licensing IP so that their own
GPU tech is not going to get them in
paint
trouble with AMD it's an interesting
deal and I'll be crucially following how
and where our DNA makes the transition
to smartphone class SOC s this last amb
story is a bit of a brief one and a note
to those who have followed our Computex
coverage over the last few weeks for our
Q&amp;amp;A series we did get a few questions
from you guys asking about PCIe 4.0 back
porting to older am4 motherboards like
x4 70 at the time we had heard that
gigabyte were claiming their older
boards would be updated to support PCIe
4.0 but we cut that question in answer
at the last minute due to new
information that new information comes
directly from AMD who say that no old
am4 motherboards will support PCI 4.0
the only boards with support will be X
570 at this stage x4 70 B 450 X 370 and
so on will only support up to pcie 3.0
pju 4.0 uses the same wiring design as
pcie 3.0 but has stricter signaling
requirements it is theoretically
possible that a well-designed x4 70
board could simply be updated to support
peace to a 4.0 while crappier x4 70
boards may not be good enough to support
the tech it sounds that AMD doesn't want
to risk any confusion between boards
that can support it and those that can't
Sue's requiring motherboard
manufacturers to keep their older boards
on pcie 3.0 this means that while
gigabyte does have an early BIOS
allowing PCIe 4.0 support on some non x5
70 products that feature will be rolled
back and disabled in final BIOS
revisions for Rison 3000 CPUs if you
want PC a 4.0 you'll need to purchase an
x5 70 motherboard Microsoft has added
better variable refresh rate support to
Windows 10 in the latest version rolling
out to users now version 1983 this
support comes in the form of a toggle in
the graphics setting menu under the
variable refresh rate header you can
choose to optimize games for variable
refresh rate while this option does
sound somewhat interesting the reality
is this toggle is largely just for
Microsoft Store titles one of the things
Microsoft kind of stuffed up with the
universal Windows platform for gamers
among other things was not supporting
adaptive sync technologies to begin with
and when they did introduce it
game to
is needed to specifically enable the
tech in their titles this switch
basically overrides the developer switch
and allows variable refresh rate support
in all you WP games it doesn't really
affect anything else because games
released outside of the Microsoft Store
of always supported variable refresh
rate technology without any significant
issues so if you do see the toggle
appear in the settings after an update
well you know what it does and then take
a reporting that Intel CPU product line
is set to become even more confusing
later this year we already know the
company will be shipping ten enemy to I
select CPUs at TDP is between nine and
twenty eight watts so your typical use
series range but joining them will
allegedly be another you series lineup
built on 14 nanometer process tech
codenamed comet Lake an antic heard
about this new line when speaking to a
partner about many pcs this unnamed
partner is planning to upgrade their u
series powered mini pcs to comment Lake
later this year in November the partner
clarified these would be fifteen what
parts used and specifically comment Lake
not ice Lake or another line the
possible plan here and I'm just
speculating here is to offer ice lag at
the high end for ultra portables and
similar premium systems then comment
Lake for more mid-range and entry-level
devices however Intel really aren't
talking much about specific temperature
and skews at this point so we'll have to
wait until later in the year to find out
more III is kicking off next week where
we are set to hear a whole lot about new
games potentially new consoles and of
course the most interesting thing for us
new AMD cpus and gpus a lot of game news
has emerged over the last few days but i
did want to highlight something that
might be of interest to you guys and
that's the fact that destiny 2 is coming
to steam and will be available as a free
to play title the free version which
will be rebranded as destiny to new
light comes with all year 1 content if
you want to access any of the expansions
beyond that of course you have to fork
over some cash as well as the move to
steam we'll also be getting cross sales
for all console platforms including Xbox
ps4 and stadia and there's also a
standalone expansion coming later this
year called shadow tape so pretty
interesting things happening on the
destiny to front there final topic I
wanted to cover is Google stadia not so
normally in our wheelhouse but just want
to run through the details and get your
opinion on it pretty interested what our
PC gaming community thinks of this one
so stadia is Google's new streaming
platform or game streaming platform it
is coming to 14 regions in November with
31 day one titles including Ubisoft
games like the division 2 and Ghost
Recon breakpoint 2 case upcoming
Borderlands 3 and deep service Metro
Exodus
unfortunately Australia isn't supported
region at launch but you guys in the US
will get to enjoy if you do live there
but the pricing structure seems a bit
strange you'll need to fork over a
hundred and twenty nine dollars for a
stadia controller and chromecast ultra
bundle to begin with from there you can
either opt to be a pro subscriber which
costs $10 a month and gives access to 4k
60fps HDR streams or you can remain a
free subscriber for 1080p 60fps gaming
but the subscription does not come with
any games instead you'll need to buy
games just like with any other console
so it's not providing a Netflix like
service like I think some people were
expecting and hoping for the initial one
$29 bundle though does include a copy of
destiny two and three months of stay to
your pro in terms of internet
connections you'll need 35 megabits per
second for 4k around 20 megabits for
1080p and 10 megabits for 720p and if
you're stuck with a slower connection
than that you won't get 60fps having
tried game streaming services and being
universally unimpressed with what they
offer compared to PC gaming or even
consoles stadia doesn't sound all that
revolutionary to me you still have to
buy games you still have to fork out
money upfront and if you want the top
quality which on paper should be better
than some in-home consoles
you'll also need a subscription there's
also not much exclusive content and the
game selection at launch is limited so
I'm not really sure what the hook is
here that will get people invested or
interested definitely want to get your
thoughts on it
chuck them in the comments below whether
you're interested in stadia and a
planning on checking it out anyway
that's it for this week's news corner as
always you can subscribe it to get this
segment in your inbox every Friday or
there abouts stay tuned for more AMD
announcements early next week as a three
kicks off plus some other good stuff
that is on the way consider supporting
us on patreon we always really
appreciate your guys
support and I'll catch you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
