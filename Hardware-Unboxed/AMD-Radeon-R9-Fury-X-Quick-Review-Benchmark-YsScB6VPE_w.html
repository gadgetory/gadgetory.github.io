box i'm your host Matt and today I
finally got my hands on amd's on I'm
fury X a couple of weeks ago AMD
releases refreshed radiant 300 series
and honestly we found a little bit hard
to get excited about 18 month old
technology dressed up with a little more
vram and some factory overclocking still
we knew something much much more
exciting was around the corner that
product of course is the fury ax a 4096
SPU enabled GPU using the gcn 1.2
architecture you might expect the
forty-five percent more SP used to be
the headline here but in fact it's the
fury axes memory technology that's been
stealing the show hbm is an abbreviation
for high-bandwidth memory which uses
vertically stacked drm diets that offer
a number of benefits for example a
single hbm stack offers over three and a
half times more bandwidth in a single
gddr5 memory chip can thanks to a
thousand 24-bit memory bus opposed to
the 32-bit bus the gddr5 uses another
big advantage of space-saving a single
gigabyte of h vm memory consumes
ninety-five percent less surface area
than a gigabyte of gddr5 the card
measures just 19 centimeters long which
is considerably shorter than the 27
centimeters flagship graphics cards
typically measure keep in mind the fury
ax does require a closed loop liquid
cooler so you also need room to mount a
120 millimeter radiator still the
advantages of this liquid cooler mean
almost silent operation and super cool
temperatures I won't talk too much about
the few ex design though because i'm
sure you guys want to get to the
benchmark results in the witcher 3 the
fury axis performance is very comparable
to the 980 TI just three frames slower
at 1440p and a blue the 390 exit out of
the water thankfully most pc masterrace
gamers would probably not find the 29
frames per second playable at 4k movie
on to watch dogs we saw the fury exes
score suffer a little bit when compared
to its green rival the 980 TI which
managed
more frames at 1440p and three more at
4k we were happy to see its core
slightly more tolerable 40 frames per
second average at 4k however in thief we
saw the fury axe actually eclipsed the
980 TI at 1440p by five frames per
second and tie the type necks at 4k with
again a moderately tolerable 38 frames
per second in battlefield hardline the
fury axes performance suffered a little
when compared to in videos 980 TI losing
out by 17 frames per second at 1440p and
by five frames per second at 4k at 71
frames per second though the game is
extremely smooth to play but it was
interesting to note the performance
wasn't much better than the GTX 980 or
the r9 390 apps The Fury acts perform
well in gta5 basically matching the 980
TI of both resolutions and falling on
the just short of the Titan x 45 frames
was much more playable at 4k than the 36
you can expect from the gtx 980 or the
i-93 90 x finally in far cry 4 the fury
axis performance is pretty outstanding
edged out the Titan apps of both
resolutions and gave us an important 7
frames more than the 980 TI at 4k the
power figures which take into account
the entire system so the fury ax is very
power efficient when compared with its
rivals only the gtx 980 use less power
the fury axis gaming temperatures with
best in its class a testament to the
built-in closed-loop cooler it averaged
just 52 degrees Celsius when gaming and
sat down at 26 degrees when idle so
there you have it the fury ax isn't the
tight next killer that many said it
would be but it doesn't cost nearly as
much either priced alongside the gtx 980
TI both cards trader blows and overall
in our test the fury x was just two
percent faster at 4k while slightly
slower at 1440p safe to say that both
cards deliver a pretty similar gaming
experience with each taking its own pros
and cons for the 980 TI it's incredible
overclocking Headroom is a real bonus
whereas the fury ax has almost no
Headroom to speak of still we feel the
fury ax offers a few advantages of its
own namely
a cooling performance and extremely low
operating volume the compact car design
is a nice feature as well it means that
it will fit into any small mini ITX case
that supports 120 millimeter radiator
immersed do now picking between the GTX
980 TI and the fury ex isn't easy for us
it really comes down to which games
you're actually going to play and if you
plan on doing any overclocking at all
overall we really like the fury ax and
we'd have no hesitation recommending it
to anyone who's planning on spending up
to six hundred fifty dollars on their
GPU thanks for watching this installment
