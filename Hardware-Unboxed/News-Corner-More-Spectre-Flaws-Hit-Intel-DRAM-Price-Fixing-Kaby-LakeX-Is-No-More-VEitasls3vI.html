box news corner
today's episode is jam-packed with juicy
news stories in creating new spective
ulnar abilities deer am price fixing
more Rison processes leaked Intel
discontinuing at cabe u leik X and more
so let's get right to it the big
breaking news story from today is a new
set of spectre vulnerabilities yep just
what Intel wanted these new floors
dubbed Spectre next generation were
revealed in an exclusive over at highest
de where they cite several teams of
researchers that have found eight new
vulnerabilities in Intel's processes
highs today aren't publishing any
technical information about these
Spectre ng floors however they do say
that all eight are essentially caused by
the same design problem each
vulnerability already has an allocated
CVE number and each will require its own
set of patches Intel have already
classified four of the eight issues as
high risk and the other four are medium
one flaw in particular is said to be the
most easily exploitable spectre
vulnerability yet allowing an attacker
to launch code in a virtual machine and
then have it cross over to the host
machine according to their sources one
of the teams that discovered these new
floors is Google's projects zero who
uncovered the original set of Spectre
issues and as per their policy Google
won't be releasing any public
information about Spectre mg until
they've given companies 90 days and
notice apparently that 90-day window is
up on May 7th where we may officially
hear about these floors until are
already working on patches for Spectre
ng according to the highest article as
our operating system developers
apparently there are two waves of
patches planned for May and August to
address these issues and there may even
be fixes distributed through Windows
updates as PC manufacturers are quite
slow at releasing BIOS revisions
intel had today released a statement
titled addressing questions regarding
additional security issues which seems
to be in reference to the highs article
without directly naming it in the
statement Intel says we routinely work
closely with customers partners other
chip makers and researchers to
understand and mitigate any issues that
are identified and part of this process
involves reserving blocks of CPU numbers
we believe strongly in the value of
coordinated disclosure and we'll share
additional details on any potential
issues as we finalize mitigations as the
best practice we continue to encourage
everyone to keep their systems
up-to-date so it does sound like there
might be some truth to the highest
report and it could just be a few days
before Intel is talking about new
expecting issues if you're wondering
about other CPU manufacturers and their
susceptibility to specter energy there
is initial evidence according to highs
that ARM processors are affected however
there is no word on whether AMD
processors are susceptible though
research is underway to determine if
they are I have seen some rumors
suggesting AMD is not affected though I
want to stress that nothing has been
confirmed at this stage and the original
source article does say they're still
researching it
so yeah more spectrum problems which is
OS fun stuff I'm sure we'll see a lot of
fallout relating to these problems in
the coming days so hold tight for now
let's move on to some other news topics
this is a story you guys have been
begging me to cover since the last news
corner d ram price-fixing yes law firm
Hagens Berman has filed a class-action
lawsuit in the u.s. targeting the big 3d
ram manufacturers samsung micron and SK
Hynix the lawsuit alleges these three
manufacturers conspired to artificially
limit the supply of memory in what
essentially amounts to a price-fixing
scheme the firm investigated DRAM prices
over the last two years and discovered a
forty seven percent price increased
during 2017 the largest jump in 30 years
which is just unbelievable really the
firm claims the price-fixing occurred at
least between June 1st to 2016 and
February 1st 2018 with the class action
open to any US consumer that purchased a
device with DRAM
in this period so that's a fair few
people these three companies own about
96% of all DRAM manufacturing capacity
so it'd be pretty easy for them to
collaborate to inflate prices and make
tons of money however at this stage
these are just unproven claims and
allegations and it will be up to the
three companies to respond and defend
themselves in a lawsuit the course could
last a pretty long time
the companies have 21 days to respond so
we should hear more on this very soon
and does align with reports that the
Chinese government is investigating
these manufacturers for similar issues
so we'll see where this all leads Intel
are discontinuing KB Lake X the CPUs
which were widely seen as a failure have
entered the end-of-life stage and won't
be available beyond about a year from
now any PC builder or store that wants
to purchase new KB Lake X CPUs will need
to do so before November 30th 2018 and
Ito will ship the final set of CPUs by
May 31st 2019 the 2 KB leg X CPUs the
core i5 7640 X and core i7 7740 X didn't
make much sense as they were very
similar to existing quad-core kbecque
CPUs they were just built for the LGA
2066 socket instead motherboards with
that socket were more expensive than LGA
1151 boards for regular cable X CPUs and
even then cabling X couldn't make use of
all the features provided by Intel's
enthusiast platform K black X was
supposed to be able to clock higher
thanks to better power delivery in a
higher TDP
but overall just didn't make sense as a
product so it's no real surprise as
being discontinued at this point and it
fits with an earlier story that
suggested Intel's upcoming X 399 chipset
will not support cable 8x an update to
AMD's product portfolio has leaked
several new Rison chips that are set to
launch soon there's not a whole lot of
information at this stage but it does
seem AMD has three quad-core second gen
rising CPUs in the works
the rise in 3 2100 rise in 320 300 X and
risin 5 2500 X then on the mobile front
we have the rise in three two thousand
new horizon 520 600 you and rise in 720
800 you to complement existing APIs
available for laptops and other mobile
devices
also this product list does reveal the
thread Ripper 2900 X thread Ripper 29 20
X and thread Ripper 29 50 X which
shouldn't come as a surprise 2nd gen
thread Ripper is scheduled for the
second half of 2018 and these product
names are basically what we expect AMD
to use at launch Intel's 10 nanometer
node continues to be an absolute
disaster for them late last week the
company revealed they had delayed 10
nanometer mass production to 2019 adding
yet another delay to an already long
list of delays 10 nanometer was
originally supposed to be ready in 2016
then it was pushed to 2017 then to 2018
and now all the way to 2019 meanwhile
competitors like tsmc Global Foundries
and Samsung are all launching new nodes
including 7 nanometers and even 5
nanometers across the next couple of
years though of course these measurement
features are just marketing and really
aren't comparable across companies right
now Intel are shipping some 10 nanometer
chips in lower volume with CEO Brian
krzanich stating that yields are
improving but the rate of improvement is
slower than we anticipated as such
volume production that was supposed to
ramp up in the second half of 2018 has
now been delayed to 2019 and it's not
clear whether this is the first or
second half of next year with the way
ten nanometers has gone to Intel so far
does seem like a second half of 2019
launch is a bit more likely if not even
later than that
this means that Intel's new set of
processes for the second half of 2018
will be yet another 40 nanometer product
their fifth consecutive line of 40
nanometer CPUs started with Broadwell in
2014 these new CPUs will be codenamed
whiskey Lake for client and cascade Lake
for data centers who knows what sort of
improvements we'll get with these new
processes but we seen previously with
the move from skylight to KB Lake that
when Intel doesn't add more cores or
move to a new architecture on the same
node there are very few performance
improvements to be had in other Intel
related news Chris hook formerly the
head of marketing and AMD's Radeon
technologies group has joined Intel as
the head of discreet graphics marketing
we know Intel are working hard on
discrete graphics products in this hire
just confirm
their plan to push into that market soon
I shall have already hired Roger Cordrey
from AMD and earlier this year they
hired Jim Keller as well who is the lead
architect on the same project
interesting that Intel is stockpiling
ahem detail at the moment I think
they've got something pretty big in the
works
AMD are set to launch patches for the
controversial CTS labs vulnerabilities
shortly
in a statement to Tom's Hardware AMD
confirms that they have shipped patches
for epic processes addressing all the
floors to ecosystem partners while also
releasing patches mitigating chimera
across all AMD products these patches
are currently in final testing with the
ecosystem partners and should be
released shortly patches for all the
other flaws on non epic products are on
track for release to ecosystem partners
this month and then those patches will
become publicly available after the
partners complete their validation work
Intel has launched a new obtain SSD the
905 P which brings incremental upgrades
over the older 900p performance is
slightly higher than the 900 P and
capacities are up with the Adhan card
jumping to a 960 gigabyte capacity and
the U dot 2 card moving up to 480
gigabytes PC perspective tested the 960
gig add-in card and performance was very
good with the best random performance
they have seen and improved sequential
performance however the price does still
remain extremely high at 1,300 US
dollars for the 960 gig card which is
more than double the older 480 gig 900
piece $600 price final topic for this
week is good news for everyone the FTC
has given companies 30 days to remove
any and all warranty void if removed
stickers as they are legally invalid in
the first place at least in the US the
FTC specifically contacted Microsoft
Sony Nintendo Hyundai HTC and soos
telling them to get rid of the stickers
but the rule does apply to basically
every manufacturer it's also a neat
reminder for those in the US that those
stickers have no legal bearing
whatsoever and even if you remove them a
warranty claim cannot be denied on the
basis of the sticker not being intact
and that's it through this week's news
