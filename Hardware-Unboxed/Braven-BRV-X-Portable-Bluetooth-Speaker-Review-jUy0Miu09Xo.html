of portable wireless speakers on the
market and today I'll be taking a close
look at that be rvx a speaker this
should be one of the most well rounded
durable speakers in its price range the
first thing you notice about the PRV X
when you pop it out of the box is that
it fits riding with its brothers and
sisters in terms of appearance the
entire Bravin outdoor range spots the
tough looking rugged exterior the
managers to offer as much protection as
it appears tube and the VRTX is no
exception
as you can see my speakers in the black
and Hardware unbox blue colorway but it
also comes in a gray black and red style
too sturdy aluminium grills protect the
front and bottom of the speaker and a
tough rubber shell braces the Biv X from
other unwanted impacts all around
offering great shock protection an ipx7
waterproof rating means you'll have no
concerns about the speaker getting
rained on splashed squirted with a jet
of water or even fully submerge for
short times and large rubber feet
provide grip and eliminate any table
wobble at high volumes on the bottom of
the speaker around the back the extra
buttons and ports are safely encased by
live the screws on and off like a camera
lens cap inside you'll find the power
port a USB port for charging other
devices a three-and-a-half millimeter
auxiliary input battery level indicator
pinhole reset button and a switch that
toggles between indoor and outdoor sound
mode the remaining and most commonly
used button to found on the top of the
unit is to corner they offer good clicky
feedback and it easy to press but also
on easily press accidentally due to
their flat design you'll most commonly
use the two large volume buttons and
then to turn the unit on and off you
simply need to hold the power button for
2 to 3 seconds and same goes for pairing
Bluetooth devices alternatively you can
quickly pair Bluetooth devices using NFC
the NFC transmitter is at the front of
the unit as symbolized with this small
logo I had no troubles pairing devices
quickly at all using both methods and
the Bluetooth performance is great - and
you comfortably walk around 10 meters
away and keep solid stream with
furniture objects even walls in between
us with my galaxy note 4 the brv X is
equipped with a 5200 milliamp hour
battery the braving claim will last
around 12 hours of playback this of
course mainly depends on the volume
you're playing back at but a 50 to 75
percent volume this is about
right it's kind of playback time is
around what I'd expect from a speaker of
its size and weight any less would have
been a little disappointing in my
opinion and now I personally don't have
to charge a portable speaker before
every use package with a speaker is a
power brick and DC cable which honestly
I don't love
I'm sure charging is faster by this
method however I would much prefer to at
least have the option to use microUSB
charging because that's what charge is
most of my other devices having to grab
out the power brick each time or leave
it plugged in always is an unwanted
hassle also included in the box is a
carry strap and a three-and-a-half
millimeter auxiliary input cable which
are both nice touches to size wise this
isn't a pocket speaker it's a little
bigger than that and we really need a
small backpack pocket or similar for
travel it's definitely not overly
waiting for its size however and I
definitely still consider it very
portable this exercise tool allows for
the unit to deliver on the most
important aspect to sound let me get one
thing out of the way first this speaker
is not gonna thrill picky audiophiles
however I feel like that barely needs to
be said because audio files know not to
expect anything crazy from a small
portable speaker anyway overall the PIV
X sound is really good it's certainly a
cute though and you can tell in some
songs a lot more than others I consider
the mid-range to be the most important
aspect of these types of speakers and
this is where the BRV X is strongest and
really quite impressive I had made
server that all remarks I was probably
the best portable speaker that heard
this is certainly on the back of its
powerful mid-range highs very clear -
and the low range is certainly better
when it's placed on a flat hard surface
like a table due to the downwards facing
low range Drive up the indoor-outdoor
switch is very effective - on outdoor
mode this sounds a little more tinny but
the sound travels a lot further and
broader thanks to the enhanced sound
profile that reinforces the waves they
can get a bit lost in such open spaces
the result is much better coverage
throughout your backyard and a barbecue
around your pool or down at the beach
there really is so much to like about
the Bravin BRB X it's rugged
construction and ipx7 waterproof rating
make you feel comfortable with it around
kids animals and water and the battery
life is good for a whole 12 hour day out
of music the sound is above and beyond
the price point and size in particular
mid-range and high notes you can snap up
to be rvx from Cogan for $259 in
Australia or for around 165 us in the
USA and for its feature certain sound
quality
that's great value thanks for
joining me for another product review
