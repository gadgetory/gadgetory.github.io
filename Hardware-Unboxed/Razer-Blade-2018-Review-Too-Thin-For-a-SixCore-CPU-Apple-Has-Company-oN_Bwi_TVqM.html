most popular gaming laptops on the
market continues to be the razor blade
and with the new model for 2018 razor
has refined the design and improved the
internal hardware to make it even better
than before and with more competition
from devices like the msi gr6 t5 stealth
thin and the gigabyte air of 15 X using
the same design in the last few years
just wasn't gonna cut it this time with
the 2018 blade razor is fully on board
with the thin bezel revolution previous
models included small 14-inch displays
with massive bezels on all sides and it
was a look that I think frustrated a lot
of people I mean why can they have just
put a larger screen in the same chassis
well clearly raises engineers have been
thinking the same thing because the new
blade features a 15.6 inch display in a
body that's essentially the same size as
the old model the result bezels on
either side of the display that are just
five millimeters thin and it looks a
whole lot better because of it there's
no nostril vision camera here either
which is good news the bezel along the
top of the display is slightly larger
than the sides allowing the webcam to be
positioned above the display just like
with the msi ge62 5 you're not quite
getting that Dell XPS bezel look but
it's close enough and still
significantly better than razors
previous design the rest of the chassis
has been redesigned slightly with a more
squared-off look as opposed to the
rounded corners of the previous gen
blade and that gives it a more modern
look while still delivering razor
signature high-quality all-metal built I
love the design of the old way but this
new look is even better it's just that
touch sleeker
plus the black metal unibody is almost
unrivaled in the gaming laptop space in
terms of build quality there's more
competition these days but razors still
does it best and in fact comparing the
blade to other laptops in general you
really only get this sort of build from
a MacBook Pro and we know how the latest
MacBook Pros perform in terms of thermal
throttling from weaker internal hardware
so we'll see how the blade fares in that
regard a bit later Razer positions the
blade as a dual purpose laptop suitable
for both gamers and professionals so
there's plenty of ports on this laptop
three USB 3.1 type
a port a thunderbolt three USBC port
full-sized HDMI 2.0 mini DisplayPort 1.4
a 3.5 mm audio jack and a proprietary
charging port of course due to the
higher power draw charger that's pretty
much everything you'd want on a laptop
of this size perhaps an SD card slot
would have been nice but I'm glad
there's plenty of other full-size ports
in terms of thickness the blade is very
impressive in just sixteen point eight
millimeters thick despite packing a six
core Intel coffee-like processor and up
to nvidia geforce gtx 1070 max-q
graphics the size of the laptop relative
to its internal hardware is one of the
best on the market if not the best
though it's weight of a touch over 2
kilograms isn't as class-leading though
that is down to the solid metal
construction you get the minimalist base
of this laptop has only three elements
the keyboard trackpad and speakers as
you might have noticed there's no numpad
on this 15 inch laptop with razor
instead opting for large speakers on
either side not sure that decision has
paid off the speakers aren't that
impressive certainly not as impressive
as the large grilles would suggest the
keyboard though is very good the travel
distance to each key is ultrabook class
but that's not a bad thing if the
response is solid and reasonably clicky
from a non-mechanical design typing up a
few documents and gaming on the blade is
a decent experience and of course you
get to enjoy the bright perky RGB
backlighting Razer still hasn't managed
to illuminate the keyboards symbols
though which is still a bit frustrating
for nighttime users as for the trackpad
its massive and extremely responsive the
perfect companion for productivity tasks
on the go unfortunately there's no
Windows hello integration on this laptop
though so no fingerprint reader or
facial recognition support and that's a
bit of a disappointment considering
several other gaming laptops of this
class have been integrating those
features lately the display is one of
the big areas that's received an upgrade
not only is it now larger than the 14
inch panel used in the previous blades
it's also high refresh in some models
the main display that most people will
be buying is a 15.6 inch 1080p IPS LCD
with a 144 Hertz refresh rate so quite
similar to most other gaming laptops out
there in 2018 there is also a 60 Hertz
1080p option for the entry-level blade
and a 4k 60 hertz option available at
the high end I'd only recommend the
okay touchscreen if you are primarily
going to be using this laptop for
productivity tasks like video editing
for gaming the 1080p 144 Hertz panel is
a much better choice the good news
though is razor
up factory calibrating every screen
across their blade 2018 lineup so even
if you get the 1080p 144 Hertz panels it
will be color accurate to the srgb gama
and the 4k options even support 100%
Adobe RGB coverage in my testing the
blade 2018 is on par with the gigabyte
error 15 X when it comes to color
accuracy with Delta is right on that 2.0
mark across greyscale saturation and
color checker tests white balance is
very good as well with an average CCT
very close to 6500 K it's not a perfect
display but for content creators the
screen is accurate enough from the
factory to really not have to worry
about further calibration however a
razor is still limited by the
characteristics of this panel so its
brightness of 285 nits and a contrast
ratio of below 1000 to one isn't
fantastic and uniformity is only okay
for a display this size for gamers
though you'll love the high refresh rate
even if there's no Jason support
performance wise the razor blade doesn't
include any hardware we haven't tested
before all models come equipped with the
Intel Core i7 87 58 and there's two GPU
options either the nvidia geforce gtx
1060 max Q or the gtx 1070 max q and my
review that came with the 1070 max q all
blades also come with 16 gigabytes of
ddr4 2666 as standard and that's user
upgradeable to 32 gigabytes and you'll
get either 256 or 512 gigabytes of PCIe
nvme SSD storage because the blade uses
hardware we've tested before I'm gonna
summarize his performance relative to
this system we use for my original I
78758 plus gtx 1070 max q review if
you're after a more in-depth look with
comparisons to other laptops and all
that sort of thing check out that review
to see how these components perform and
then you can use the percentage
differences on show here to see where
the razor blade sits cpu performance was
actually quite disappointing from the
blade 2018 fully 9% slower than a
gigabyte era 15 x reference system
across our tests weight in some cases
particularly video rendering the
performance drop was upwards of 15%
in fact it was usually these longer
tests where the blades suffered more
though almost every test revealed the
play to be slower now you're probably
wondering why is the blade slow when it
uses the same hardware well OMS have the
ability to configure how the CPU runs in
terms of power limits and these power
limits govern the clock speed behavior
things like turbo boost and so forth the
error 15x we test with has a turbo power
limit of 52 watts and a short burst
limit of 70 watts and in a Cinebench r15
run you can see how the CPU reaches
those limits in stages with the razor
blade 2018 it's a bit different Intel's
XTU reports estate and short burst
limits of 60 and 80 watts respectively
so that's actually better than the era
15 X but in actual practice these aren't
the limits the CPU adheres to instead
there appears to be a hard cap of 45
watts for both short bursts and turbo
and I should note this is regardless of
the power plan you choose this suggests
razer has opted for the 8750 HHS's C TDP
down state which limits the sustained
TDP to 35 watts and that's exactly what
is observed in longer workloads the
result of this power limit is reduced
performance as I showed earlier
interestingly enough though in CPU only
workloads the cooler is more than
capable of cooling the components
leading to temperatures around 75
degrees Celsius and a noise output of
just 38 DBA which is outstanding for
this sort of laptop I wouldn't be
surprised if the blade could actually
handle the full 45 watt configuration in
these sort of tests but they've gone
with a power limit so it is what it is
though is upgrading from an old laptop
with a quad core Core i7 7700 HQ you
will still see a performance improvement
of 15% on average and that's up closer
to 30% in some multi-threaded tests
that's not as good as the full 50
percent performance improvement you can
expect in the a 750 H configured at 45
watts but it is still an improvement so
with the lower-than-expected CPU
performance how does the GPU very well
it's much better news here the gtx 1070
max-q performs exactly as expected and
it's only in a handful of games that the
slower CPU has an impact looking at
average frame rates compared to our
reference system with the same specs the
razor blade was within the margin of
error in all but three games watchdogs
to pry
and Assassin's Creed origins however
some other games are up to 7 percent
faster and that leads to an average
result really that's no different to our
reference system looking at 1% loads
there are a few more losses including
rise of the Tomb Raider but again the
average result only puts the blade 2018
1% slower than our reference system it
will depend on the game you're playing
but in most cases the CPU configuration
razor has gone with will not have a
significant impact on the game
experience you also find the blade a
decent 9 percent faster in average frame
rates and 5 percent faster in 1% lows
compared to a laptop with the gtx 1070
max-q
but just an i7 7700 HQ an aside so that
new CPU is providing a performance
improvement in games it is important to
note here as well that the new blade
does push up to a gtx 1070 max-q whereas
the last gen blow topped out at a GTX
1060 we actually tested the old blade in
a smaller selection of games and the new
blade is more than 25% faster on average
in that group with wins in every single
game the max-q gtx 1070 may not be as
fast as the fully fledged gtx 1070 but
it is faster than the gtx 1060 used in
the previous model and that means we're
getting more performance in the same
form factor and that's exactly what max
q is designed for unfortunately while
gaming the new razor blade still runs
hot and loud in our standard watchdogs
to test run the CPU reached around 88
degrees and the GPU set at 81 degrees
with cool it noise levels exceeding 45
DBA which is quite loud to make matters
worse the cooler noise is quite annoying
with a prominent high-pitched whine when
it really ramps up and it's here you can
see the reason razor used the 35 watt
configuration for the CPU there is
simply no more thermal Headroom when
gaming had the CPU been allowed to run
at 45 watts the cooler would have either
been overwhelmed thermally or it would
have to crank up even louder from an
already loud state rather than throttle
down the GPU raised it decided to hit
the CPU and while throttling down
neither is obviously ideal tuning down
the CPU makes more sense than tuning
down the GPU because it has less of an
impact in games it would be awesome if
the razor blade could crank the CPU up
to 45 watts in tasks like video
rendering and then jump down to 35 watts
in gaming then you'd get the best of
both worlds with gaming and productivity
performance on par with laptops that
don't use the C TDP down state however
they haven't done that and it might not
be possible anyway so what we're stuck
with is cat productivity performance to
ensure the system isn't overwhelmed
while gaming despite running hot and
loud surface temperatures are ok the
middle area above the keyboards scorches
at above 50 degrees Celsius under gaming
load
however the left side of the keyboard
where the important gaming Kizer is
quite cool somehow kept around 35
degrees Celsius or less some parts of
the keyboard particularly in the center
towards the top can hit over 45 degrees
but the blade is otherwise comfortable
to use while gaming using the WASD Keys
I wouldn't want to use it on my lap
though as the other side could burn you
at over 50 degrees Celsius so stick to
using it on a desk a couple of other
things to finish this one off the blade
uses the Samsung PM 9 81 SSD in my case
with 512 gigabytes of capacity and as
we've known from previous reviews this
drive is very fast and performs well in
both sequential and random transfers as
for battery life we're looking at an 80
watt our integrated cell and that's good
for ok battery life it's not bad not
amazing just ok for this sort of form
factor luckily the lack of G sync has
allowed razer to use optimist technology
so we can switch off the discrete GPU
when not in use and that does help with
battery life but the blade 2018 won't
last as long as high-end 13-inch Ultra
portables which is pretty typical for
this class laptop all up the new razor
blade is a bit of a mixed bag and that's
similar to previous models in this line
there are plenty of things it does
really well including it's awesome metal
unibody design excellent updated high
refresh gaming display and it's factory
calibrated you're a decent keyboard and
trackpad plenty of ports and good
internal hardware it's gaming
performance is also very site matching
our reference system with identical
hardware across our test suite of games
considering the blade now comes with
this 6 core CPU and up to a gtx 1070
max-q
that means it's more than 25% faster in
games compared to the old blade model in
what is essentially the same form factor
and that's hard to complain about
however the blade still runs hot and
loud while gaming and that's meant razor
hesitated to use the 35 watt
configuration of the 8750 H while this
doesn't have a significant impact in
games it does hurt productivity
performance so compete
laptops like the msi geo 65 and gigabyte
era 15x are better choices for those
that want to edit videos and game on the
same system then you have to factor in
the pricing the blade with the gtx 1070
max-q inside starts at a huge 2400 us
which is $200 more than a GS 65 with
equivalent hardware lower team walls are
also more expensive the design of the
blade is far and away the best on the
market with this hardware inside and
gaming performance I guess is pretty
similar to the GS 65 but I'm not sure
those factors justify the price
difference and then on top of that the G
R 65 CPU is not limited in productivity
workloads so MSI is offering is at least
on par with the blade for gaming but
it's faster for productivity all while
costing less I really want to like the
razor blade as it has the makings of a
great system there's so many things this
thing does well but the pricing
situation and the issues with its CPU
makes it difficult to recommend unless
design I guess is the most important
factor for you I think most people
looking to buy a blade would be better
off with the revamped and aggressively
priced msi gs70 of its portability as
well so you're not losing out a whole
lot by going with the GS 65 that's it
for this review of the new razor blade
for 2018 I think it's only a few tweaks
away from becoming the standout gaming
laptop option on the market so I do have
high hopes for the next generation
