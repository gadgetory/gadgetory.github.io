have a classic head-to-head cpu
comparison for you and it's been a while
since I've done one of these and today's
comparison might seem a little odd at
first well it might be odd period but
we're doing it anyway before that
today's video sponsor is deep cool and
they're amazing anti leaked technology
featured in the new captain 240 Pro
after years of research and development
deep core has created a leak free
all-in-one liquid cooler using that
patented automatic pressure relieving
radiator which as the name suggests
fence any air pressure from within the
loop to avoid leakage for more
information please check the link in the
video description recently when I put my
top 5 best desktop CPUs video together I
noticed that quite a few of you had
access to cheap first generalising
processes and by quite a few of you I
mean those that live in places such as
the u.s. in Europe not Australia had
access to yeah really really really
cheap first gen rising process as a
standard option for me was the rise in
seven seventeen hundred quite incredible
the eight core sixteen thread processor
was selling for a hundred and sixty
dollars us that was available at major
retailers such as Amazon and Newegg and
yeah just an incredible deal that and it
meant you could either get the r7 1700
or the r5 2600 that said for those of
you buying new my primary choice in this
price range was actually the horizon 520
600 X as it is only $20 more at least it
was at the time making that video then
the non ex model and it comes with a
much better cooler and more aggressive
clock speeds out of the box so I felt
the small price premium really was worth
it however since making that video quite
a few of you have asked me if the
horizon 7 1700 was worth buying over the
2600 X and naturally you do get two
extra cores and well that's pretty good
the downside though being that you miss
out on any of those n+ optimizations and
they do make the second gen part a
little more responsive a bit snappier if
you will for productivity workloads that
require many cores the r7 1700 is a more
obvious choice the clock speed
disadvantage and higher memory latency
generally
come buy a 33% increase in cause that
said if your workload doesn't require
eight cause then the 2600 X will be
faster then for those of you who are
prioritizing gaming which I feel is
probably most of our audience which CPU
is better well based on our day one
coverage you'd have to go with the 2600
X but a year later has anything changed
today's game is more demanding well
that's what we're here to find out for
all the testing I've used the GeForce
r-tx 20 atti to help minimize the GPU
bottleneck but before some of you groan
about how using such an extreme GPU is
unrealistic and whatnot please note all
the testing takes place at 1080p 1440p
and 4k so the 4k results will be
comparable to say 1080p with a mid-range
graphics card moreover those of you
using lower quality settings with a
lesser graphics card will actually see
higher frame rates since the integrated
memory controller of the second gen
Rison processors is much improved
I didn't hamper the 2600 X when it came
to memory instead I pair it with 16
gigabytes of ddr4 3416 memory the r7
1700 on the other hand that was limited
to ddr4 2933 memory and by limited I
mean it wouldn't actually work with
faster memory it simply wouldn't burn it
up but again I did use a 16 gigabyte kit
this time though with slightly tighter
CL 15 timings both CPUs were tested on
the gigabyte x4 70 horas gaming 7 Wi-Fi
with the standard box coolers please
note I'm not looking into overclocking
if you're interested in that then you
can find those results in our day 1
review the margins won't really have
changed I'm also going to be focusing
mostly on gaming there'll be a couple of
application graphs at the end of the
video but again the application
performance won't really have changed
since our day 1 review so there's really
no point going over all that again so
the focus will be on gaming namely new
games so let's get into the benchmarks
first up we have vermintide 2 and this
is a good example of a tiler
isn't particularly CPU intensive at
least not when comparing 6 &amp;amp; 8 core
processors basically we're seeing
identical performance
out of the 1700 and 2,600 X despite what
looks to be cpu-bound performance at
1080p with the RCX 20 ATT I still not
much to report here so let's move on to
Assassin's Creed Odyssey ok so the
results here are a little more
interesting the Rison 7 1700 is seen
limiting performance at 1080p quite
heavily in fact when looking at the 1%
lower result here the 2600 X was
offering 26% more performance keeping
frame rates above 60 fps at all times
moving to 1440p and now we're becoming
GPU bound but even so the average frame
rate was still 10% greater using the
2600 X then once we hit 4k we are mostly
GPU limited but even here the 2600 X's
improved latency and support for faster
memory did account for a small
difference although Fortnight isn't a
particular CPU demanding tile again when
discussing 12 and 16 thread processors
we do see quite a significant
performance uplift with the 2600 X
obviously the clock speed advantage and
improved memory performance is playing a
key role here the 2600 X was up to 20%
faster at 1080p and still provided up to
17% more performance at 1440p then by
the time we hit the 4k resolution the
margin was reduced to nothing and by
this point we're seeing the same
performance regardless of which cpus
used apex legends is also not a
particularly CPU demanding title but we
do see up to a 10% performance advantage
going the way of the 2600 X at 1080p
this margins reduced to 7 percent at
1440p and then completely eliminated at
4k and I have to say given that the non
GPU bound results are all over 140 fps
the difference probably doesn't matter
here too much moving on we have Resident
Evil 2 and here the 2600 x EK out a few
extra frames at 1080p offering around 9%
more performance that margin was half
dat 1440p and then completely eliminated
at 4k so depending on the quality
settings and resolution you might see up
to a 10% difference but most likely
you'll see no difference at all in this
title next up we have Just Cause 4 and
this time we do see up to a 15%
performance advantage going the way of
the horizon 520 600 X even at 40
forty Peter 2600 X was eight percent
faster not a massive margin by any
stretch of the imagination but still a
decent performance boost at this
typically more GPU demanding resolution
hitman two is always a bit of an odd
title here we see the r7 1700 creating a
bottleneck at all three resolutions as
it limited the RCX 20 atti
to just 72 FPS however we did see a
consistent drop to the one percent low
performance as the resolution was
increased and the 4k result in
particular is quite unusual the 2600 X
allowed for up to a 10 percent
performance boost and offered a more
consistent one percent low result
project cars to seize the 2600
delivering up to 10 percent more
performance at 1080p and 12 percent more
at 1440p the 2600 X does appear to be
GPU limited at 1080p and 1440p while
this is only true for the r7 1700 at
1080p by the time we hit 4k both CPUs
are heavily GPU limited so performance
is much the same the 2600 X was up to
15% faster and Rainbow six siege and
even at 1440p offered slightly more
performance though with both CPUs
capable of over 120 FPS at all times you
have to wonder how much those margins
matter moving on I have to say I was
quite surprised as in the 2600 X up to
20% faster in battlefield 5 even at
1080p basically the horizon 7 1700 was
limiting the r-tx 20 atti to around 100
FPS on our tests so this created a
bottleneck atonia P that resulted in
similar performance seen at 1440p that
said at 1440p we are still primarily GPU
limited and this is of course even more
true at 4k World of Tanks might better
utilize rice and CPUs today but still
not exactly a CPU intensive title the r5
2600 X edge slightly had at 1080p and
1440p by an insignificant margin and
then as usual we were GPU limited at 4k
Metro Exodus is another Tyrell it's not
particularly CPU demanding at least for
a modern processor and again while the
2600 X was fast at 1080p and 1440p the
r7 1700 was still providing strong frame
rates
I wouldn't say Far Cry new Dawn's a
the CPU demanding title either but
rising CPUs have always performed a
little bit strange in the Far Cry series
the primal results were always very odd
and we we saw that when we first started
testing the first generation rising
processors the game seems quite
sensitive to memory latency and despite
being what Wilkes CPU limited at 1080p
even with the 2600 ex the rise and 5
processor was still 12% faster and this
was seen again at 1440p so the faster
memory and lower latency of the 2600 ex
has to be accountable for this
difference what's really strange here is
that we continue to see the r7 1700 fall
away at the 4k resolution which should
be entirely GPU bound here but doesn't
seem to be the case with the Rison 7
processor moving on we see the exact
same issue in testing we shut off the
Tomb Raider here the Rison 7 1700 is
seen limiting performance to a III fps
on average Atari P and as a result
performance is much the same at 1440p
meanwhile the 2600 X limited performance
to around 87 fps in this minute was
roughly 5% faster frame rates when
testing with monster hunter world were
much the same the 2600 X did offer a
small performance boost but overall the
experience was much the same using
either CPU strange Brigade is also
another one of those tiles that isn't
particularly CPU demanding and it's a
good example of how things will look I
suppose in a typical game or when your
GPU bound Star Wars Battlefront 2 is
demanding on both the CPU and GPU but
when you've got 12 or more threads to
play with the CPU side of things really
isn't that much of an issue that being
the case there really wasn't much
difference between the 2600 X and 1700
then finally we have the division - and
here we see similar performance using
either CPU so again not too much to
report here other than the fact that you
will receive a similar gaming experience
for the 2600 X or 1700 in this title ok
so I think it's fair to say at the Rison
520 600 X and risin 7 1700 are pretty
similar in terms of gaming performance
when we did see a difference it was the
2600 X that was faster in every single
instance usually though it was only
faster by a 5 to 10% margin and I feel
most gamers probably won't notice the
difference still if you only intend on
gaming then I feel the 2600
is the better CPU to get are you going
to benefit more from the lower latency
memory also the higher clocked memory
and the improvements to all the cache in
the CPU again latency improvements the
r7 1700 does have two extra cores of
course but I don't think they're going
to prove useful in gaming anytime soon
for the vast majority of games so I feel
like for the life of these CPUs the 2600
acts just will be the better gamer
however like I said at the start of the
video if you can put those extra two
cores to work than the Rison 7 1700 is
going to become a lot more attractive
and that said it isn't massively faster
as it will require some tinkering in a
BIOS to really pull a noticeably ahead
of a stock 2600 ex for those of you not
interested in overclocking the r7 1700
is just 4% faster out of the box in our
blender tests so for content creators
the 2600 X might actually prove to be
the better choice as its clock speed
advantage and lower latency memory will
make it better for editing even when
talking rendering tasks so the Rison 7
1700 was just 6% faster as seen here in
corona so it's not the 2600 X is getting
blown out of the water despite only
having half-a-dozen cause and finally if
you require further proof then here are
some Cinebench r15 results here the 1700
was just 3% faster when comparing the
multi-threaded performance however it is
important to note that for single
threaded I suppose even lightly threaded
workloads the 1700 will be around 15%
slower and this was often seen in our
gaming benchmarks you might have noticed
the Rison 7 1800 X results in the
previous few application graphs and it
was up to 20% faster than the 2600 X so
that is certainly achievable with the r7
1700 through a bit of overclocking the
1700 does have quite a bit of
overclocking Headroom of course I am
generalizing a bit here if you do get a
dud chip than the overclocking Headroom
may not be great but based on my own
purchase history and I have bought quite
a few of these chips over the last year
or so now your chances of getting a dud
I would say a very slim however if
you're not interested in overclocking
and you have your choice of either CPU
at the same price or within $20 of one
another I'd get the rise in 520 600 X
every
time the Zen plus refinement certainly
weren't game-changing but the latency
improvements do help overall it just
makes the 2600 X feel a bit snappier and
frankly though you really can't go wrong
either way there's no bad option here
there's no wrong choice and I feel for
quite a few of you passing up an
eight-core 16 thread CPU for just a
hundred and six dollars u.s. that one's
not going to be easy
also is then to just around the corner
it's a bit of a difficult choice for
those desperate to upgrade or build a
new computer do you hold that a bit
longer or do you just snap up one of
these dirt-cheap first or second
generation processors now if it was me
and I could wait obviously I would wait
till the point where the reviews come
out on the rise and 3,000 chips and then
I'll reevaluate the options then but if
for whatever reason you simply can't
wait then yeah there's certainly some
great options available right now and
