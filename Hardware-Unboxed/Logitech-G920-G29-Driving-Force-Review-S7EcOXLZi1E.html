back to hardware unboxed announced four
months ago now logitech c920 driving
force racing wheels and they recently
gone on sale I picked one up some
testing and of course to show off my
elite driving skills also on hand is the
PlayStation G 29 version for comparison
the G 9 20 is Logitech's first
force-feedback racing wheel available
for the Xbox one however we'll be
looking at it and testing it from a PC
users perspective it's the follow-up to
their highly acclaimed g27 racing wheel
which at this stage has an average user
review score of four and a half stars
from over 1200 reviews on Amazon much
like the g27 the G 920 delivers its
force-feedback utilizing a powerful dual
motor force feedback transmission with
anti backlash helical gearing modeled
after the gearing used in real-world car
transmissions Logitech claims this
feedback system realistically simulates
the feel of weight shift road conditions
and tire degradation so you can feel
understeer and oversteer as well as
traction loss and more G 920 is also
designed to be extremely durable and it
certainly has a solid feel about it it's
a design combined of metals and plastics
including solid steel ball bearings in
the wheel shaft anodized aluminium
spokes as well as stainless steel paddle
shifters and pedals the wheel itself is
of higher quality it's supposedly
wrapped in hand-stitch leather it's
someone really sitting there stitching
these things by hand I hope not
nevertheless it feels and looks great
and it does give the impression of a
performance race car wheel the design
also features built-in clamps and bolt
points which allow you to easily and
securely mount the racing wheel to your
table desk or cockpit and the base of
the pedals unit has an anti-slip
material to minimize movement during
your heavy heel towing it's hard to
stuff up the button location on a
controller wheel and the controller
experts at Logitech haven't this time
all your standard faceup Xbox buttons
are on the front of the wheel as opposed
to the shifter on the g27
and they work and feel good just as
expect the pedal system comes standard
with a clutch however unlike the
previous g27 model the actual shifter is
disappointingly sold separately for an
additional 60 ish dollars at that price
I know we're Logitech's and job their
shifter apart from aesthetics the only
real difference between the pedal system
on the g9 20 when compared to the g20 7
is a Nixon brake mod which is meant to
simulate the progressive braking that
you would feel through your pedal in a
real car if your g27 owner already
though don't despair i've read you can
make this modification to your existing
wheel yourself quite easily with a $25
replacement part
comparing the g 920 to the g 29 there
are a couple of differences the g 29
does feature shift lights which while
aren't essential i do think they're a
nice feature to have there's also a
couple of different buttons obviously on
the g 920 you've got all the Xbox one
buttons and on the G 29 you have the
PlayStation 4 buttons but you also get a
plus and minus button on the G 29 and
there's also this red 24 point not wheel
I'm a PC player so I was a little bit
disappointed to miss out on the ship
lights I'm not really sure why they
weren't included they aren't exactly
crucial however they did take away a
little from my f1 2015 experience
performance wise the G 920 and the G 29
live up to their predecessor the g27
but they don't do anything more than
that I'm not sure if Logitech would
openly admit it perhaps they would this
new series is simply a refresh of their
previous model with an updated
appearance and compatibility for the new
consoles I don't want to come off too
negatively as the G 920 and G 29 of
really great racing wheels to use but at
the new MSRP I was hoping for some more
tangible improvements coming in at $400
plus an additional $60 for the shifter
makes it a pretty hefty price tag and a
lot of racing sim enthusiasts would
encourage you to spend a little more on
a truly high-end racing wheel setup PC
users on a budget g27 is certainly the
way to go that can be had for as low as
a hundred and eighty dollars in some
places and if you're willing to do a
little fiddling for an extra 20 or 25
dollars you can make the Nixon brake mod
yourself and then there's truly no
difference apart from
aesthetics and button placement I think
I speak for most racing gamers when I
say that mid race the last thing I'm
thinking about is how the steering wheel
looks or where my Xbox buttons and d-pad
are overall the G 920 and G 29 is
certainly a nice setup they both look
great and durability should never be a
concern they also both come with a
2-year limited hardware warranty and
logitech a known for having great
customer support my only qualm with the
package is the price perhaps if the
shifter was included it would be a
little bit easier to swallow thanks for
tuning in again to hardware on box I'm
Harris Matt I'd love to hear your
thoughts in the comments would you
consider buying the G 29 or g9 20
