today we're comparing the horizon 930
900 X head-to-head against the Cora 999
okay in 36 games because apparently I
don't like sleep anyway there's loads of
results to go over but Before we jump
into all those benchmark results here's
just a few quick notes on the test
system setup the thirty-nine her X has
been tested on the gigabyte x5 17 horas
extreme using the latest biased revision
and there are two test configurations
the first of which I'm calling stock is
the 3100 X with the Wraith spire RGB box
cooler and nothing more than the XMP
profile loaded in the bias using ddr4
3200 cell 14 memory then we have an
overclock configuration using ddr4 3600
cells 16 memory the corsair hydra h1 15
i 280 millimeter all-in-one liquid
cooler with PBO plus order OC enabled
there's also stock and overclock
configurations for the core oh nine
nineteen hundred k as well though they
are both technically overclocked as
we're not manually power limiting the
Intel CPU so I guess it's better
explained as out of the box and then
manually overclocked anyway the stocker
out of the box configuration uses ddr4
3200 cell 14 memory with the corsair h
115 i on the gigabyte Zed 390 ultra then
for the overclocked configuration the
memory has been upgraded to ddr4 3600
cell 16 with an all core clock of 5
gigahertz all testing takes place at
1080p using the msi r-tx 20 IDT eye
gaming extra oh and while we'll look at
the margins for all 36 games towards the
end of the video I'm only going to
discuss the results for about a dozen of
the titles tested for the rest of the
results you can find them over on our
patreon page for free link is in the
video description okay let's get into it
first up we have World War Z both
platforms have been tested using the
latest version which brings about a
number of fixes and performance
improvements both stock and overclock
the 99er okay was just 2 percent faster
than the 3900 X and that's obviously a
negligible difference needless to say
the gaming experience was
indistinguishable between the two CPUs
and both allowed the RT X 20 atti to
render well over one hundred and 60 fps
all times next up we have Forza horizon
4 and here the 3900 X trailed by a 4%
margin when comparing these stock
out-of-the-box performance that margin
half with both CPUs overclocked and at
this point I think it's fair to say the
9 star K is maximized in the RT X 2082
eyes performance this is largely a GPU
bound title but it's still worth testing
given the game quality and its
popularity now Starcraft 2 it's been
heavily requested for this comparison
and I have to admit this is the first
time I've really been chucked at this
game in a worst-case scenario previous
benchmarks have been based on 2 V 2
gameplay but it seems we're risin really
struggles is with the bigger 44 matches
when all teams are maxed out so what we
have here is an absolute worst case
scenario and unfortunately for AMD the
99 RK is up to 19% faster out of the box
scene when comparing the average
framerate with both CPUs overclocked the
9800 K was still 12% faster which is
quite a reasonable performance advantage
that said they did have similar 1 % low
performance so the difference wasn't
that easy to spot another title where
Rison really seems to struggle is shut
off the Tomb Raider and please note
we're not using the built-in benchmark
which I believe does help out the 3rd
generation processors so this is in game
performance and here the 99 Herrera was
17% faster which is a rather large
margin and I had hoped the 3900 X would
do better here where the 3100 X did
surprise me was in monster hunter world
here both processors deliver a similar
average framerate yet the 1% low figure
was 13% higher for the horizon processor
not only that but once overclocked for
3100 X was the clear winner offering not
just greater 1% low performance but also
slightly improved average frame rates as
well the 1900 did get back to its
winning ways and apex legends though
here the 3100 X was just 7 percent
slower dropping 10 FPS on average when
comparing these stock performance that
said the margin did grow slightly once
both CPUs were overclocked now the 3900
X is seen to be 10% slower the second
battle royal title tested is fortnight
and while the 3100 X was plenty fast it
was still quite a bit slower than the
9900 K although we do only say a 5%
deficit for the average framerate the
right
and processor was up to 13% slow we're
looking at the 1% low performance but if
you don't need over 160 FPS then the 30
100x will do just fine but again I
should just say that if you do seek
maximum performance you'll obviously
want the 9900 K the Resident Evil 2
results are quite interesting stock the
3900 X was 6% slower on average but
provided stronger 1% low performance
beating the 1900 cab I ate 4% margin
then when overclocked the average frame
rates were much the same though the
Rison process is still provided much
better minimum frame rate performance
overall the experience was much the same
using either CPU next up we have
Assassin's Creed Odyssey and this is
another one of those titles where yeah
look the Intel CPU is faster on average
but you'll never notice a 4% reduction
in average framerate when using the 3900
X and that's particularly true given
these strong 1% low performance of the
horizon processor
well this is quite interesting aim D
claimed in their own first party
benchmarks that the 13 I heard Rex was
faster than the 99 okay in the Counter
Strike global Offensive benchmark and I
have to admit I didn't really believe
them but lo and behold the 3100 X was a
smidgen faster performance was basically
the same overall but I didn't really
expect the 3100 X to push average frame
rates higher than that of the 9900 K
despite offering silky smooth frame
rates in battlefield 5 the 3100 X was
still quite a bit down on the 1900 K
trailing by an 8% margin for the average
frame rate and an 11% margin for the 1%
lo we see similar margins for both these
stock and overclocked results
moving on f1 2019 here the 3900 X was 7%
slow out of the box but once overclocked
that margin was reduced it as 3% as both
process has now enabled a similar level
of performance this is another one of
those instances where if you don't need
to keep frame rates well above say 144
FPS it really doesn't matter which CPU
you use the third last game we're gonna
look at is Far Cry new dawn and this
isn't a particularly great title for AMD
CPUs though it's not a bad one either
here the 3100 X was nine percent slower
out of the box and ten percent once both
CPUs were overclocked frame rates were
perfectly acceptable but for maximum
performance the 99 arcade does deliver
the best results the third and final
Battle Royale style game that I've
tested his player on owns battlegrounds
and just to be clear I'm not using the
replay feature to measure performance in
this one rather I'm dropping into the
same map in the same spot and measuring
performance that way the 900k was
overall faster but the 3100 X was just
4% slower on average so not a bad result
for AMD here then finally finish up the
benchmarks his World of Tanks and hit
the 3900 X was 8% slower and looking at
the average frame rate both CPUs push
frame rates up over 200 FPS so again I'm
not sure how important that 8%
difference is here overall the 9th no
hurricane looks to be the faster of the
2 CPUs for gaming but who's surprised by
that I have to say though it did look
pretty close so I think we should move
on to some performance breakdown graphs
to see just what the difference was
across all 36 games tested ok so on
average the 3900 X was just 6% slower
than the 19 R ok and really that's not
too bad at all now I say this all the
time but I'll say it again for titles
where the margin was 5% or less I deem
those as a draw this is because you're
generally looking at margin of error
type differences for example 32 32 FPS
well that's a 7% increase then for
extreme high frame rates a 5% increase
is like going from 200 to 210 fps it's
not exactly a margin worth getting too
excited over anyway I know the vast
majority of you get how percentages work
so sorry for that very basic explanation
moving along there were a few titles
with a 30 100 X nudged ahead by
insignificant margins and there were
quite a few where it lost by an
insignificant margin in fact exactly
half of the games tested saw an
irrelevant margin separating these two
processes there were a few games where
the 3900 X was slower by a 10% margin or
greater 7 games in fact and we see that
worst case the horizon processor was up
to 16% slower now just quickly with both
CPUs overclocked we see a very little
change here the 3100 X was 5 percent
slower on average so pushing the 900k up
to 5 gigahertz doesn't really give it an
advantage so not much more to say he
really let's just move on to wrap this
thing up alright so in my day 1 review I
found the 3900 X to the 8 percent slower
on average across the nine games tested
and here we see by adding another 27
games to the mix that
didn't change too much but I was quite
surprised to find that it actually
played a little bit into AMD's favor I
mean the thing I learned reacts still
was overall the slower processor but it
did close the gap and that's because our
day one review admitted games such as
Counter Strike global Offensive Monster
Hunter World ashes of the benchmark and
insurgency sandstorm I've just decided
now as I'm wrapping this video that I
think I will cycle through as many of
the benchmark graphs as I can so for the
ones that we haven't seen I'm just going
to throw them up for a few seconds but
again for easier viewing of all these
graphs please head over to our patreon
page the link will be in the video
description when it comes to value these
new results don't change too much if you
ignore the Box cooler the 3100 X is a
little more costly per frame than the
9900 K however if you wish to take
advantage of the Box cooler then the
3100 X is a little cheaper than the
Intel processor at the end of the day
they're both 500 ish dollar CPUs and
depending on it use your PC for one
maybe better than the other for example
if you plan to not just play games but
also work on your PC create videos maybe
3d modeling or really anything else that
can take advantage of a 12 core
processor then the riser 930 100x is
going to be a significantly better
investment in fact it will almost
certainly proved to be the better
investment if you plan on keeping
whatever you buy now for the next three
years or more
the only reason I'd invest in the 1900
be if I played games such as Starcraft 2
that do play noticeably better with the
Intel CPU at least late game in 4v4
battles
likewise you'd really only go Intel if
for some reason you needed every last
frame possible but short of that the
3100 X is the better choice and this
will become even more evident moving
forward it's also worth remembering that
we see very little difference at 1080p
with an RT X xx atti this means using an
RT X 2080 more than Hobbs the margins we
see here I know this because I've looked
into it then with an RT X 27 T or rx
5700 performance will be identical
alternatively if you play at a higher
resolution that's more GPU bound well
you'll find the same thing very little
difference in terms of before
moments overall not much more to say on
this one if you enjoyed the video please
give it a like always much appreciated
from us and if you would like to spot
the channel more directly while also
receiving some pretty cool perks such as
access to our private discord server our
monthly live streams that Tim and I do
where you can ask questions and request
two tests and all that kind of stuff
then you head over to our patreon page
and again you'll find all the other
graphs there as well as always thank you
