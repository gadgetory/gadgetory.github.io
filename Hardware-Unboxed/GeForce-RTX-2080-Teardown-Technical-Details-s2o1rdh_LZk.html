the official unboxing embargo for the
GeForce r-tx 2080 and 20 atti but in
addition to just taking out of the box
and showing you the card we can share
some more technical information and
video provided us with loads and loads
of info a way more than we had time to
digest has only got access to it last
night and I have been busy testing that
new Athlon 200g II processor despite
that I will be touching on some of what
we believe to be the more interesting
aspects of the technical document but
ultimately I think you guys are probably
a bit over hearing about how well the RT
X series will perform based on
information provided by Nvidia so most
of the details will just save for our
review on the 19th at which point we'll
finally have performance numbers that
will actually mean something
since we're allowed to unbox and show
you the card I thought we'd go one step
further and tear down the 20 oh you have
a closer look at the PCB and of course
the new cooler we do have a dual fan
cooler that we've sort of seen but we
haven't really got a truly good look at
yet I don't think so we're going to do
that and we'll also compare it to the
cooler on the 1080 and as luck would
have it I do have a teardown draw 1080
cooler basically so we can check that
out and nice and convenient
unfortunately you've probably noticed I
have just the single box I don't have my
20 atti yet is on the way but some
issues there with DHL and customs so
that has delayed the card hopefully I
will get it tomorrow if not on Monday
and then I can get all the testing done
ready for our day 1 coverage and video
we're a little bit slow getting the
cards out it's usually pretty tight
these deadlines this one seems a little
more crazier than normal but yeah
hopefully it goes smoothly from this
point forward we just got the drivers so
drivers are also quite late basically
all media around the world can kiss
their weekend goodbye along with that
thing you normies call sleep sorry first
before we rip the car out of the box and
have a look at it and drool over it
basically but she's going for a few
technical details basically the main
architectural change
between Pascal ensuring is the addition
of two extra blocks in each cheering SM
unit whereas Pascal was essentially just
a massive collection of floating-point
units cheering introduces tensor cores
and integer units in addition to the
standard floating-point units this makes
the call larger and increase of the TDP
but crucially cheering supports
concurrent FP 32 and into 32 execution
Fortin video claims is a handy
performance boost the idea is that the
integer instructions that previously
around the floating-point units can now
be offloaded to the integer pipeline
ensuring and running concurrently with
floating-point instructions in video
claims that on average 36 integer
instructions can be offloaded and run on
the entry cores per 100 floating-point
instructions though of course that
varies depending on the game it's
claimed by envy this concurrent
execution helps improve shader
performance by 50% or more in some
situations of course these graphs don't
show how concurrent execution will
impact a game's final France a second
figure shading is only one part of what
the GPU needs to do to render a game so
your stuff to wait for benchmarks to see
how this architecture change impacts
gaming performance but what we know is
that at least one aspect of a game
rendering can be accelerated in a new
way with cheering cheering also has a
native HDR display pipeline thanks to an
all new display engine so the
performance dropped Tim discovered with
Pascal cards when switching on HDR
should be fixed with cheering in video
is very keen for us to explore this but
with extremely limited time our tests
the cards that will likely have to be a
follow-up piece probably produced by a
team and the final thing worth
mentioning right now is Nvidia has a new
env scanner API that allows one-click
overclocking utilities such as EVGA
precision will integrate this API and
provide a feature where with one click
you can sit back for roughly 20 minutes
as a software uncovers the exact voltage
frequency curve for your graphics card
and from there you can choose optimal
stable frequencies to run
sounds pretty neat and we'll have to
give that one a try a bit later on with
our review Tim also plans to dive into
overclocking and provide some separate
content pieces around that as well so it
should be quite interesting so that is
pretty much everything we need to
discuss at this point I think it's time
to take the r-tx 20/80 out of the box
I'll take
look at the card first we'll go over all
the external design of the card then
I'll do a quick jump cut you guys will
be none the wiser but I'll jump away
quickly test thermals and then I'll jump
back to tear the thing apart and we'll
continue from there okay so I'll get my
knife and I'm a bit excited about this I
don't think I've ever anticipated a new
graphics cards or new GPU release as
much as this anticipate the performance
be interesting to see how these perform
obviously we won't know until next week
but yeah very exciting stuff so here is
the box pretty standard box similar to
the other ones I mean the box Art's a
bit different the physical design and
size of the box is what we've seen with
previous models so here we go it'll
probably be in a anti-static bag yes it
is so it doesn't look quite as good hmm
got some a little tag attached to it I'm
pretty sure that doesn't come with the
retail versions we'll just cut that off
without scratching the card okay let's
take this anti-static bag off and we got
some clear plastic protecting it we'll
get that off and let's try that again
for maximum effect are you ready for
this so actually I don't want to lose
any fingers I need them for benchmarking
and here we go again it's like you've
never seen me do this before whoa
awesome I have to say it actually looks
a lot better in the flesh than it did in
the release announcement coverage and
photos and stuff we saw I said in my
announcement video that I didn't really
like the look of this card I a lot of
people didn't like the look of this car
but I quite looked quite looked I quite
liked the look of the original founders
issuing card I thought it was quite cool
like the aggressive lines or the
triangles and things well that was
pretty cool but
obviously not everyone's cup of tea but
anyway and I didn't really like the look
at this but I have to say seeing it in
the flesh I think it looks actually
looks really good that feels very
premium yeah
the silver backplate which is a
one-piece backplate this time looks
really nice a lot better than what I was
expecting to be honest it looked a very
plasticky and nasty and the photos I
thought but yeah it's a it's pretty much
all aluminium and you'd see it in most
systems like that and I think that looks
that looks pretty awesome so obviously
it looks very different to the original
10a found edition graphics card for
obvious reasons the coolers very
different you have the single blower fan
on this design which they've used for as
long as I can remember pretty much till
back in the days when they were single
slot cards and going back a long way
but anyway we get the two fans and we
get what looks like a massive heatsink
we're going to get into that in a second
nice little IO panel there we've got the
types Eve got display ports I'll provide
some information about the display ports
towards the end of the video HDMI so a
three DisplayPort out and then of course
the sort of a backplate that we just
looked at which wraps all the way around
the card completely encloses the card so
that's different and then we have this
little plastic bit here that pops out to
give you access to the envy link
connectors if you want to connect
another card up but yeah SLI I don't
know if you guys still do that I don't
yeah I think it's probably time to go do
what I've got to do with this jump back
and then we'll pull it apart
okay so in total the PCB measures twenty
six point four centimeters long and nine
and a half centimeters tall and weighs
238 grams the cooler though that tips
the scales at a whopping 936 grams which
is seriously heavy for what is a rather
compact cooler by high-end graphics card
standards with the cooler installed the
r-tx 2080 found edition measures 27
centimeters long and 10 centimeters tall
and in total weighs twelve hundred and
sixty six grams making it 25% heavier
than the 1080 fe card
speaking of which of the cooler on the
1080 Fe weighs just 686 grams and that
means the 20/80 cooler is 36% heavier
the fins on the heat sink measure 12
millimeters tall and run virtually the
entire length of the card so this is
largely why the card is so heavy that
and the fact that almost the entire
thing has been constructed from
aluminium on the PCB we of course have
the massive Turing GPU codename tu-104
there's also eight one gigabyte GDD are
six memory chips providing an 8 gigabyte
vram buffer the chips in question of
microns mt6 1k 256 M 32 J a 14 a and
this is their 14 gigabits per second
memory we also find what looks to be an
8 + 2 phase very amusing on
semiconductor power stages I wasn't
quite able to make out the part numbers
but the time I had available so I'll
have to dig into that for their review
finally I should just note the RT X 28
EF e cards feature a 6 pin an 8 pin
power connector whereas the FE version
of the GTX eternity only included a
single 8 pin I have to say overall I am
much much happier with how these new
found Edition graphics cards look as I
said earlier didn't really like the
images the stuff provided by Nvidia that
we saw online but yeah now having got my
little grubby mitts on it I very much
approve it's a it looks and feels very
premium so yeah very very nice card of
course you guys are probably sick of
hearing about these cards without seeing
any actual benchmarks and I'm a bit sick
of talking about them with any without
actual benchmarks at this point so
thankfully we don't have to wait too
much longer now so stay tuned next week
we will have our day-long coverage
there'll be loads of reviews online so
you can check ours out I encourage you
to check out other reviews and see what
we all find and what we all think our
day one coverage will include about a
dozen games so possibly not as many as
you guys are hoping for but it's just
you to time obviously we only have a few
days to get this stuff done so i bench
marked all the other cards and been
doing that madly for weeks now all that
data is in just got to add this to it
yeah we'll probably do twelve games for
the day one coverage because we also
want to look at things like overclocking
thermals power consumption and whatever
else but on day two the following day we
will have a 30 plus game comparison so
that will be probably worth waiting
around for it should be pretty good
speaking of which I need to go get
benchmarking so I'm going to take this
guy up to the benchmark lab now and go
get testing as always thank you for
watching like subscribe do all that good
stuff and I'll catch you again soon
