comparison is one that I've been
promising for quite some time now and
with Computex 2019 out of the way I
thought it was time I finally made it
happen I am of course talking about an
updated comparison between the risin 5
1600 and the core i5 7600 K so it's time
to see which processor offers gamers the
best performance in 2019
before that though today's video is
sponsored by Corsair and there void Pro
RGB and HS 70 wireless gaming headsets
both offer an exceptional audio
experience using specially tuned 50
millimeter neodymium speaker drivers and
the premium build quality means they're
not just highly durable but also very
comfortable both offer a 16 hour runtime
with a slew of other features so for
more information please check them out
via the link in the video description
now back in 2017 when the are 560 Hera
was first released you could quite
easily argue in favor of the 7600 K as
it was the better gaming CPU at the time
it was faster in the vast majority of
games and in games that were considered
to be quite old at the time but still
rather popular the 70 Satake was much
faster however for newly-released titles
so that is newly-released titles in 2017
they were for the most part quite evenly
matched and we saw in some of the more
heavy a core heavy games such as ashes
of the singularity the rise in cpu was a
little bit faster but performance in
titles such as battlefield 1 for example
were also more consistent that said we
still saw the rise in processors
struggle in a number of titles such as
ARMA 3 day 6 mankind divided Far Cry
primal Grand Theft Auto 5 total war
Warhammer - and watchdogs - for example
despite that though I preferred the
Rison 5 1600 overall as it was cheaper
and I believed represented better value
it featured superior platform support
came with a box cooler and generally
beat the core i5 processor in
productivity workloads in fact for
intensive workloads the Rison 5 1600
mimicked what we saw from the core i7 77
are ok and that was hugely impressive
for the time for those reasons and more
just two months after its release we
named the rising
five sixteen hundred as the best value
desktop CPU that said I noted that for
high refresh rate gaming the seventy six
Enrique would be the better choice at
least in the short term but I did expect
the extra two cores and eight threads of
the rise and five processor to come in
handy before too long well it's now
roughly two years later and we haven't
really revisited this comparison rather
the focus over the last year or so has
been on these n+ processors such as the
risin 5 2600 today though all that
changes but before we get into the
results here's a quick look at the test
system specs the risin 5 1600 was tested
on the msi be 450 tomahawk using g.skill
ripjaws v series ddr4 3200 cell 15
memory then the core i5 7600 k was
tested on the asrock z 270 Taichi with
the same g.skill ripjaws 5 memory both
systems are also configured using the
extreme memory profile while MC was
disabled on the Intel system at least
for the stock testing both also used the
gigabyte RC X 20 80 TI horas extreme and
the CPUs were cooled using the corsair
hydro series age 100 i pro RGB
all-in-one liquid cooler both CPUs were
tested stock and then with a realistic
overclock applied so we're not
pretending every CPU sold is of the
highest quality silicon in total there
are eight games tested at two
resolutions so over 200 benchmark runs
were made to create this content
certainly not our biggest benchmark
session ever but a decent effort overall
I think anyway enough chitchat
let's get into the results first up we
have the newest title that when our
benchmarking with Rage 2 in this game
uses the Vulkan API exclusively and to
be honest it's not the most demanding
CPU title out there as we found it plays
pretty well on a modest quad-core as you
can see here the core i5 7600 K offered
a slight performance bump over the Rison
v 1600 though given the clock speed
deficit you'd probably expect the
margins to be a little greater than that
1080p with an RT X xx atti then moving
to 1440p we see similar margins the Core
i5 processor is a little faster out of
the box but once we overclocked both
processes that margin is reduced to
almost nothing
World War Z supports DirectX 11 and
Vulcan but for Best Performance we
always test with the Vulcan API
here we see that although
CPUs allowed for well over 100 FPS out
of the box the 7600 K was 14% faster on
average again this is another title
isn't particularly taxing on the CPU and
we found that modern quad cores will get
the job done as we move to 1440p we set
the margins I've virtually eliminated
here the 7600 K was just 4 percent
faster other box and three percent once
both CPUs were overclocked if you're a
call back my first benchmarks gaming
performance for the rise in 1000 series
we found that Far Cry primal was a
particularly bad title for AMD's new
rise in CPUs it seems single thread
performance is the key here that means
far cry games just developed with rising
in mind despite AMD sponsoring the
latest installment in the series though
I believe that was mostly to optimize
for their Radeon technology anyway
whatever the case the rice and CPUs
don't do well in Far Cry games and we
have another good example of that here
with far cry new dawn although the r5
1600 was able to deliver smooth gameplay
it was still much slower than the core
i5 7600 K which delivered a whopping 25%
more frames the margins are very similar
at 1440p as well here the r5 1600 isn't
able to come back and we saw way better
performance out of the core i5 processor
I should just note that I'm aware that
some media have reported frame
stuttering even with the latest 6 core
Core i5 processors in Far Cry 5 and Far
Cry new dawn but I have to say the
experience was certainly no worse than
what we saw from the Rison 5 1600 the
hitman 2 results for the 7600 K are a
bit strange
given how CPU limited this title is
you'd expect a 23% or call frequency
boost for the Core i5 processor to have
a rather significant impact on
performance but here it really doesn't
we only saw a few extra frames from the
7600 K once overclocked I should note
that we do often see strange results
when testing with hitman 2 and I
honestly don't know what's going on here
with her NPC heavy benchmark the r5 1600
on the other hand saw a decent 6 percent
performance boost from its 8% or core
overclock so yeah that makes sense and
we see similar margins are 1440p
overall both CPUs delivered a similar
gaming experience in hitman two okay so
things are getting a little bit
interesting here shadow of the Tomb
Raider is one of the most demanding
games that's been released in the last
year the
five 1600 was noticeably smoother in
this title and with 22% more frames on
average it was a lot faster and
interestingly again we see that once
overclocked the 70 secondary K appears
so heavily choked that the frequency
increase doesn't really help there
appears to be some other kind of
bottleneck here the performance gains
for the r5 1600 overclocked are very
mild but also much more in line with the
frequency increase and then once we move
to 1440p the r5 1600 continues to blitz
the 76 and okay offering almost 30% more
performance when both CPUs are
overclocked horizon 5 1600 also proves
to be the superior choice when testing
with Assassin's Creed Odyssey this is
another modern demanding title here the
Rison 5 processor offered 16% more
performance out of the box and once the
CPU is overclocked it was still 13%
faster then we see at the more GPU
limited 1440p resolution that the
results come together but even so once
overclocked the r5 1600 still enabled 8%
more performance and overall was
slightly smoother ok so this is the
first time we've really seen the core i5
76 an arcade full completely flat on its
face
and while battlefield 5 was still
playable the experience was pretty
horrible compared to the smooth r5 1600
we saw a similar thing in our day 1
rising coverage though not to the quite
this extent back then the 7600 K
provided higher frame rates on average
in battlefield 1 but the 1% low
performance was noticeably weaker today
when testing with battlefield 5 the 1%
low performance is a bit of a disaster
for the 7600 K and this means although
the r5 1600 was only slightly faster on
average the actual gaming experience was
really world's better and we see at the
core i5 7600 case still crash and burned
at 1440p
this really is a game that requires more
than 4 cores and 4 threads even if they
are clocked at around 5 gigahertz
another series of horrible results for
the core i5 7600 K can be seen when
testing with the division to hear the
Rison 5 CPU was 33% faster out of the
box when comparing the average frame
rate of 32% faster for the 1% low result
that margin is reduced once both CPUs
are overclocked but even so the r5 1600
was still 25% faster on average and
4% faster for the 1% low then we sent
1440p at the are 5 1600 store remains
well ahead even with both CPU is
overclocked it really is the clear
winner here
that concludes the testing but for those
of you who either weren't paying
attention or you've just skipped to this
point of the video I will quickly
summarize what we found overall the
risin 5 1600 was really only noticeably
slower in a single game and that game
was far cry new dawn before which was
still very smooth though and the game
was very playable but the frame rates
were quite a bit down on what we saw
with the core i5 7600 K the Rison
processor was also slightly slower in
World War Z while performance was much
the same enraged - and hitman then as we
move into the more demanding modern
titles we found r5 6100 to be a good bit
faster in Assassin's Creed Odyssey and
their world's faster when testing with
battlefield 5 shut off the term Raider
and the division 2 so these findings
really are in line with what I said and
found roughly two years ago now back
then the core i5 7600 K was faster in
the majority of games as I mentioned
earlier in their video and there were a
number of older titles where the rise in
CPUs did struggle however even back then
rise and still showed a lot of promise
it performed really well in the most
demanding titles of the time and overall
we found it was more consistent back
then I did recommend the rise in 5 1600
over the core i5 76 hurricane for a
number of reasons I felt many were
relevant at the time but one future
reason was that I believed it would
eventually end up being the better
gaming CPU and this has certainly ended
up being the case as demonstrated in
titles such as Assassin's Creed Odyssey
battlefield 5 shut off the Tomb Raider
and the division 2 it just seemed to me
that the horizon 5 1600 just had so many
more CPU resources that eventually those
would come into play and it would
probably happen sooner rather than later
so it is a bit different to the
situation we see between processors such
as the Rison 720 700 X and core i7 87 or
okay for example that said I should just
note that if you're still playing older
titles such as Far Cry primal Grand
Theft Auto 5 and I don't know total war
Warhammer - for example then the core i5
7600 K will deliver superior performance
in those game
though the horizon 5/6 data will still
comfortably provide playable performance
taking all this into consideration if
you were faced with upgrading or
building a new PC and mid 2017 you have
the choice between the core i5 7600 km
rising 5 1600 and you needed this new PC
to last a few years between upgrades and
you intended on playing the latest and
greatest games well if you want the 7600
K I have to say you made a mistake today
the r5 1600 is the superior performer
enabling highly playable performance in
all the latest games while the 7600 cave
struggles in a number of tiles and often
provides disappointing results then as a
bonus if you did invest in the am 4
platform two years ago you now have the
luxury of upgrading to what is expected
to be a much more powerful than 2
processor without having to change your
motherboard meanwhile 7600 K owners have
to pay through the nose for a 7700 K as
that's really their only feasible
upgrade option or at least if they want
to stay on the platform it's probably
not a feasible upgrade option because
you'd be better off just buying a be 350
motherboard and a then to process or a B
feel 50 board or whatever but anyway if
you want to enable playable performance
on your existing system then a 7700 K
will be required to run titles such as
battlefield 5 smoothly in fact there's
almost no chance you'll land a
secondhand 7700 K for less than what a
brand new Rison 530 600 X is going to
cost as a side note for this video I've
obviously only focused on gaming
performance but if you care at all about
core heavy application performance then
there really isn't too much more to
discuss here the Rison v 1600 absolutely
thrashed the 7600 k at launch so nothing
will have changed here if anything rise
ins actually improved in this area as
software continues to be optimized for
there's an architecture and not only
that but the platform itself has matured
quite a lot and as a consequence it is
now faster and more stable
meanwhile the kb lake arranged along
with all Intel processors have become
slower due to the security
vulnerabilities that were publicly
revealed in early 2018
anyway it's been great to see how AMD's
rise in CPUs have totally transformed
the desktop PC landscape and such a
short period of time
I expect the horizon 5 1600 to continue
running away with it as we get newer
and more demanding games and I suspect
it won't be too much longer before it's
constantly nipping at the heels of the
core i7 7700 K and that is going to do
it for this one if you enjoy the video

Q&amp;amp;A s and there's also our exclusive
discord chat so yeah that's really cool
I should probably wrap this up because
my voice is going it's been all along
previous week over in Taipei Taiwan
doing Computex and when I got back of
course I got sick for a few days so my
voice is still recovering and I've kind
of blown it out with this video anyway
