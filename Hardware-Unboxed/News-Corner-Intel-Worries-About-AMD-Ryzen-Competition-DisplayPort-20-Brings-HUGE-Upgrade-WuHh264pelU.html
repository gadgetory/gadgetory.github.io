corner my first video in a little while
as Steve said in some of his other
videos I've been sick this week still
pretty sick now but I couldn't leave you
guys without a news corner this week so
here I am hopefully I'll be a bit better
by this time next week gonna try to keep
this one short let's get into the news
quick update to begin with on the wealth
of NVIDIA GeForce RT X super rumors that
have hit the news over the last few days
most of which you can find on video
cards right now there have been alleged
pictures specifications release dates
and all that sort of thing plus various
moral names for partner cards from all
sorts of companies we've been getting a
lot of questions about super so I did
want to make brief mention of it here
but unfortunately we can't say anything
on the topic so sorry guys we just have
to wait until the official release to
hear our thoughts or any further
discussion on super but clearly it's
coming and coming soon so you shouldn't
have to wait too much longer in other
interesting news an internal memo from
Intel was published to Reddit a few days
ago detailing the company's thoughts on
the upcoming battle with AMD the long
profile was posted to their employee
only portal and doesn't really give any
new insights but it's an interesting
read for those that want to see how
Intel are discussing AMD with their own
employees I'm not going to read the
entire thing here you can do that if you
want to via the source links below but
there are some interesting sections I
wanted to highlight for starters Intel
clearly are aware of what AMD are doing
they don't have their heads in the sand
or anything like that this document
clearly states that especially for
high-end desktop and server products
they expect competition to be fierce in
fact for service they say competition is
expected to be the most intense in about
a decade
Intel's AMD competitive expert Steve
Collins is quoted as saying Intel will
be facing tough competitive challenges
Intel still believe that they will have
a performance advantage with their ninth
gen core products when it comes to
lightly threaded productivity workloads
and many gaming benchmarks but expects
to lose in multi-threaded workloads
until goes on to say that they don't
like Cinebench and feels the tool is not
representative of real-life workloads
and say they will work with the press to
each other they're using what they claim
are real applications for evaluating
performance but if it interesting when
they're given Cinebench is a benchmark
tool for a real-world app in cinema 4d
Intel also expect to be challenged
in the service space especially for
throughput oriented benchmarks the scale
well with core count they do however
expect to maintain the lead in workloads
to make heavy use of cash or require low
memory latency until also say they have
a competitive position in notebooks and
business pcs as customers value specific
aspects such as productivity performance
battery life and overall manageability
where Intel has a clear advantage versus
the competition Intel believe that their
software will be a key advantage to
their fight against AMD which is a bit
of a strange one not sure how that will
actually play out in practice until also
banking on their overall profile of
products and technologies to give
customers the best experience some of
the most telling comments come in the
Q&amp;amp;A section with Steve Collins Collins
admits that AMD will likely price their
parts significantly below Intel and that
will translate into good performance per
dollar a lot of his suggestions as to
how until welcome Peter interesting not
sure whether Intel's claims of having a
better platform overall will hold up but
this is a repetitive theme throughout a
few super interesting quotes are found
throughout the document
Collins believes that performance
challenges absolutely exist and that
some of Intel's innovations may not
always result in high performance
benchmark scores and that they price to
what our customers value he also says
that we might dip below on performance
like the second half of this year but
then at other times they could deliver
three times the performance collins also
says Intel's focus needs to be on
getting our execution in shape as soon
as possible we're in a competitive time
partly because of our execution issues
where that's right into our process
technology node or to our products that
intercept those nodes of course this
whole memo really isn't Intel saying
they are screwed or anything like that
it's just to let employees know that
they are aware of the issues facing the
company and that the executive team are
working to make Intel competitive in the
short and long term still for us and
non-employees it's an interesting read
to see where Intel thinks they are
currently positioned Razer has announced
DisplayPort 2.0 which is bringing a
massive increase in bandwidth that will
facilitate an entire new generation of
displays in its fastest configuration
called uhb r20 DisplayPort 2.0 will
offer 80 gigabits per second of raw
bandwidth which thanks to more efficient
coding results in a huge 77 point three
seven gigabits per second of effective
bandwidth just shy of three times the
bearment
the existing DisplayPort 1.4 protocol
with HP r3 this is all facilitated by
replacing the physical interface layer
with Thunderbolt 3 although DisplayPort
2.0 will work through both USB C and
DisplayPort connectors
however despite port 2.0 is more
complicated than just offering 77
gigabits per second of bandwidth there
are actually three modes you HP r 10
which delivers 38.7 gigabits per second
uhb are thirteen point five which ups
that to 52 point 2 gigabits per second
and then the top end you HP are 20 mode
as seventy seven point four gigabits per
second the key thing to note here is
that only you HP are ten will work over
standard passive copper cables similar
to those we're using today for
DisplayPort devices to access the higher
bitrate modes at least for now
those're is pointing towards either
tethered setups or active cables to
maintain the necessary to signal
qualities so with that in mind
DisplayPort 2.0 uhb r10 is around the
same level of bandwidth as hdmi 2.0
which delivers forty two point six
gigabits per second and both will
compete for usage in similar devices for
now another cool thing is that
DisplayPort 2.0 introduces mandatory
support for display stream compression
or DSC which further extends the
capabilities of the protocol so what can
DisplayPort 2.0 do well with the
standard passive you HP are 10 mode
we're going to be able to achieve a lot
4k 144 Hertz with HDR over a single
cable and possibly with no DSC 8k 60
Hertz with DSC and even up to 8k 120
Hertz provided you don't want HDR and
then as well knock you HP are thirteen
point five and you HP are twenty down
the line which will be able to do crazy
stuff like 1080p at 1000 Hertz 16 K at
60 Hertz and unthinkable stuff for now
like 8k 144 Hertz with HDR the first
devices to use display point 2.0 are
expected to hit the market in the late
paths of 2020 of course we will need new
display devices such as new cheap used
to be released with support for the
protocol but it is a big step forward
for DisplayPort and the stuff we can do
with displays a Google researcher
discovered a flaw with the way AMD's
epic server chips provide secure
encrypted virtualization which would and
I'm calling an antique here because I'm
not a security expert allow an attacker
to recover a secure key there would
provide access between previously
isolated VMs on a system
the good news is this floor has been
addressed through a firmware update
version 0.17 bill 22 which is now
available to all customers this 4 was
first disclosed to Amory in February the
firmware was released in June and now
we're hitting public disclosure if you
injure security stuff I suggest reading
me an outtake article to get the juicy
details but since it has been corrected
through a firmware update and doesn't
require ongoing mitigation efforts
it all sounds a bit easy compared to
some of the stuff Intel has recently
been facing MSI have launched a low
profile GeForce GTX 16 50 graphics card
some people out there still enjoy
building half-height systems where this
sort of card can come in handy and MSI
is delivering that through this new GPU
which offers Justin HDMI and DVI port
it's a dual slot card to accommodate the
cooler and offers stock performance
could be handy for HTPC applications
where size is an issue unfortunately no
word on pricing or availability yet
Intel are set to support an integer
scaling option with upcoming general
Evan GPUs through a drive update that
will launch around the end of August
apparently general Evan is required for
this feature due to hardware that isn't
present in older designs integer scaling
may be a niche feature for some but it's
key for those that want to upscale say
emulated games or older games designed
to run at a specific and much lower
resolution than modern displays integer
scaling results in no loss to quality
when implemented properly take a game
running at say in native 540 P normal
scaling would upscale that to 4k using a
7.1 times scale factor knew something
like a bilinear algorithm to do it which
doesn't look amazing and introduces some
artifacts integer scaling would instead
run at a 7 time scale factor and present
black bars Ram image to preserve the
cleanest possible presentation
unfortunately Intel weren't clear about
whether their integer scaling method is
pure integer scaling or just nearest
neighbor the announcement did come with
some talk of nearest-neighbor hopefully
they get it right because it would be a
great feature for gamers that want to
play emulated or older games with the
best visual quality final topic for this
week EVGA are offering a trading program
for owners on older GPUs to get a
discount when purchasing a new r-tx
graphics card if you have an EVGA gtx
980ti gtx 980 GTX 970 GTX 780 Ti
GTX 780 or GTX 770 you might be eligible
for between 50 and 150 US dollar
discount when purchasing a new GPU if
you send the old Cardy in first
depending on the card at hand the deal
is either slightly better or slightly
worse than sewing the card on somewhere
like eBay for example you can get a
little more than $75 for a GTX 970 on
eBay but you'll be lucky to get $100 for
a GTX 780 Ti so it really depends on the
card you have the main issue for people
wanting to use this deal is you will
have to send in your old card before
EVGA will send out your new r-tx
purchase and it will go through a
validation process it's also only
available for those in the US but still
could be handy for some that's it for
