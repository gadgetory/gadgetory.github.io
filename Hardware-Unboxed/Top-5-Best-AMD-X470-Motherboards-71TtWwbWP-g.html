checking out my favorite X 470
motherboards it's another top 5 video
and the categories include the best
entry level a best value all rounder
best of the best no compromises our best
micro ATX and best mini ITX there's
loads of motherboards to go over and we
have multiple options from the likes of
a soos asrock MSI and gigabyte so let's
get into it shall we
today you won't have a hard time finding
a name DX 370 motherboard for $100 u.s.
there are numerous options available x4
70 boards though they are a little more
pricey as the cheapest examples will set
you back 130 to 140 dollars u.s. and at
that price we do have a few options to
choose from such as the MSI x4 70 gaming
+ m SI x 470 gaming pro and the gigabyte
x4 70 Ora's ultra gaming the MSI models
are actually pretty much the exact same
board the pro version just gets a fancy
looking i/o cover and well that's about
it the board does look better but in my
opinion not sure it's worth the $10
premium in any case I would opt for the
gigabyte x4 17 horas Ultra gaming for a
few reasons most notably which being
that it is just a better equipped
motherboard the x4 70 or ultra gaming
includes a much better quality audio
solution higher quality networking USB
type-c more USB ports in total and a
better m2 implementation the VRM is
similar on both the gigabyte and msi
board so they pack a 4+2 design with a
double ax and this provides plenty of
power delivery for even an overclocked
Rison seven and twenty seven hundred x
overall MSI gigabyte offer competitive
products at these low price points but
for me the gigabyte x4 7e or as ultra
gaming is the best affordable X 470
motherboard on the market right now
okay so you've got a shiny new Rison 520
600 X or perhaps a Verizon 727 hundreds
processor in your sights and you want to
give it the home it deserves but you
also want to keep the budget somewhat
under control and this is where the best
of value all-round app it comes in for
$160 us we've got their sous tough x4 70
gaming plus or is that Plus gaming I
think it's plus gaming and then we have
the asrock fatality x4 70 gaming k4 and
170 dollars us the gigabyte x4 17 horas
gaming five at $180 us and then their
soos prime X 470 Pro at $185 us our
pricing will no doubt and move around a
bit so I'm not going to wait too much of
my decision here on the prices they're
just worth noting though I have to admit
I'm not really a fan of the asou stuff
x4 70 plus gaming although it is the
cheapest board here I feel like the
entry-level boards that we just looked
at are actually better equipped for
example a tough model packs an inferior
vrm less features and the features that
it does include are of lesser quality
the asrock fatality x4 70 gaming k4 is
nice but I feel for just a slight
increase in price the gigabyte x4 70
horas gaming 5 and a surprise x4 70 Pro
are much better boards picking between
those two though yeah that's not going
to be easy
I could easily justify going either way
on that one to be honest
as tough as that choice is I think I'm
going to have to go with your soos prime
X 470 Pro I really like the 6+2 vrm
design featuring six real phases and SS
that's really nice there and the real
tech s 1228 audio feature and crystals
sound 3 that's going to be tough to beat
as is the higher quality intel gigabit
networking so while the asou spry max
470 pro might be the most expensive of
the bunch it's also where I put my money
right so we're now well into risin 720
700 X territory and for those proud
eight course 16 thread owners there are
four good options to choose from though
this time we do see as rock challenging
a suits for the most expensive board
that said there is a cheaper version of
as rocks X 470 Taichi ultimate known
simply as the Tai Chi and the only real
difference is that that cheaper model
does drop the 10 Gigabit LAN support so
if that's not a feature that you really
require then it's probably worth saving
the $70 and just going with the vanilla
Taichi version to date I've had a heap
of hands-on experience with the azrog x4
70 Taichi ultimate gigabyte x4 17 horas
gaming 7 and the Isuzu og cross s7 hero
Wi-Fi they are all exceptionally good
boards with no real faults to speak of
so for me picking between these boards
really is going to be another tough one
and that said in terms of value the
standard as rock x4 70 Taichi board is
hard to beat and therefore most likely
the best value extreme x4 70 board
although I honestly feel there is no
wrong choice here from a value
perspective which this category isn't
about but if value was of concern at the
high end
then the asrock x4 70 Tai Chi and
gigabyte x4 70 or as gaming 7 do make a
lot of sense but I think once again I'm
gonna have to go with a soos on this one
the asou ROG cross the s7 hero has won
me over for a few reasons firstly I
really like to look at this board it's a
bit more serious while it still has some
a nice aggressive styling and that well
just does it for me in terms of features
is also very well stocked
there's loads of USB ports are plenty of
USB 3.1 ports and the rest of the
features that are included are of the
highest quality
one of my favorite aspects though is the
BIOS it's up really well for
overclockers and PC enthusiasts that
like to fine tune their system the
included memory presets are amazing and
it's great to find these stilts Samsung
B die profiles included as well these
kind of extras really make all the
difference in my opinion and for me it's
what made working with the Asuza ROG
across s7 hero
pleasure
okay so this one's a bit of a trick
category since there are actually no
micro-atx X 470 motherboards not yet
anyway you'd think I would have come up
with an additional category here
something with motherboards that
actually exist but yeah I couldn't think
of one
so yeah let's use this opportunity to
discuss I am for micro ATX motherboards
oddly there aren't really any micro ATX
X 370 boards either well that's not
entirely true
gigabyte did offer a few models and one
of them does still appear to be on sale
and that's the a B 350 M ds3 H which
despite the name does actually use the X
370 chipset so that's very bizarre quite
a strange choice there by gigabyte
they've justified this though by saying
that the price of the board reflects
that of a be 350 board and not an X 370
board and due to the layout some X 370
features aren't present I have to say I
find both points a bit odd firstly the
fact that you could offer a micro ATX
x-ray so many bought for $70 well that's
a good thing why water that fact down by
calling it a be 350 board and then while
I get having some features missing isn't
particularly great you can't exactly
place two graphics cards in crossfire on
a mini ITX X 370 board there are quite a
few of those from as rock buyer start a
sous and even gigabyte anyway not quite
sure what was going on there it seems a
bit strange to me but whatever it
doesn't really matter really all that
does matter is that micro ATX X 370
boards certainly were very rare and
there were no models from a sous as
rocket or MSI there's a micro ATX the
river Ripper board so you would expect
to see some good X 470 boards and there
certainly are plenty of great cases that
could take advantage of them so I do
hope that we see some nice micro ATX X
470 motherboards of course there will
likely be a number of micro ATX be 450
boards and once that chipsets released
but I still would like to see some
high-end X 470 models anyway no X 470
micro ATX motherboards to speak about at
the moment
hopefully we can revisit this kind
in a future video
right so so far there are just two mini
ITX
x4 seventy boards in existence and well
they are both very good from a soos we
have the ROG Strix x4 70 I'd gaming and
from asrock the x4 70 gaming ITX AC and
design wise they both have I suppose
their strengths and weaknesses there
overall they are very good and really
the biggest difference is the price
their sous model costs 210 dollars u.s.
whereas the Azeroth board is a little
more wallet-friendly at 180 dollars us
the advantage of the sous model is that
it packs to M 2 slots one on the front
side of the board and then one on the
back side so if you want to use to
high-speed MVM a drives of this board
really is a must
the disadvantage though being that it
has two m dot two slots and this means
that the front side of the board the
design there is just very crammed and
placement of certain things just isn't
great such as the SATA ports so yeah
having just the one port on the back
side of the Azeroth board has allowed
them to make a bit of a a bit cleaner
with their design both boards do pack an
impressive erm particularly for mini ITX
motherboards and both do include passive
cooling on the very em and the bundles
are also very similar including a nice
Wi-Fi antenna which also supports
bluetooth of course and you do get
multiple SATA data cables in the package
I really like the look of the Zeus ROG
Strix x4 70 I gaming but unless you do
require two m dot 2 slots I feel like
the asrock x4 70 gaming ITX AC is the
better Buy of the two the only issue
being that right now is out of stock
everywhere at least it appears to be and
it's not currently being sold in
Australia so for many of you the asou
smaadahl might be the only choice for
those of you watching this video in the
future well I hope the future has been
bright and availability of the asrock x4
70 gaming i TX AC is good should the
board still be available for an $30.00
us less than the asou smaadahl then
that's what I suggest you purchase
thankfully there are already loads of
great x4 70 motherboards to choose from
and I'm sure we'll see more in the
not-too-distant future
I currently pricing does start at around
$130 us which isn't too bad but I expect
pricing to drop down if the x3 70 boards
around and they go from yeah a lot of
nice options from a soos asrock
and gigabyte they've all done a great
job with their boards as I said earlier
for the most part you really can't go
wrong anyway I hope these pics have
helped you guys out and if you happen to
agree or disagree with any of them feel
free to jump down in me jump down in the
comment does a jump I think I said I
meant jump jump down in the comment
section below
let me have it or say good job Steve if
you agree with me you guys know how to
do comments and yeah that's gonna do it
for this one so I'm your host Steve and
I'll catch you again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
