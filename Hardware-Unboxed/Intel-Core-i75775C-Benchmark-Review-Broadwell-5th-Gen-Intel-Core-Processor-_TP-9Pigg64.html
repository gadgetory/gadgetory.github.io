boxed I'm your host Matt and today we're
taking a look at Intel's latest Core i7
5775 see last month until I announce
their Broadway a desktop lineup which
included two socketed CPUs the core a
750 775 C and the core i5 56.75 C both
of which are fully unlocked meaning you
can overclock them and we'll touch on
that a little later in this video but
for now I'm going to try and tell you
everything you need to know about
Intel's 5th generation Core processors
as quickly as possible first of all this
is a minor release from Intel as they're
essentially shrinking Haswell down from
22 nanometers to this 14 nanometers with
Broadwell that's said although Broadwell
is essentially just a die shrink Intel
has made a few important improvements
aside from power consumption and the
reduced die size that you can expect
remove into a smaller node intel's
worked on greatly improving the
performance of their integrated graphics
both the new core i5 and core i7
processors are equipped with the iris
pro 6200 graphics engine whereas
previous desktop models use the HD
graphics 4600 the previous 4600 had 20
execution units whereas RS pro 6200 has
more than twice as many at 48 you use
this huge increase in execution units is
great but what really makes the iris pro
6200 so much faster is the new L 4 cash
or EDR AM codename crystal well this 128
Metcash significantly boosts the
bandwidth available to the GPU tripling
the bandwidth that was previously
available as you might expect the core
i7 5775 C is a quad core CPU that
support type of threading affording it
eight threads the cores are clocked at
3.3 gigahertz with a maximum turbo
frequency of 3.7 gigahertz which is
lower than any Haswell Core i7 processor
the 5775 C also has a smaller l3 cache
than any of the desktop Haswell i7
processors that just six megabytes
compared to eight megabytes for the
previous generation still we expect
around attempts and increase in
instructions per clock so the light
occation low
clock's 5775 see should be able to rival
the house well i7s despite the fact that
they look faster on paper that being
said let's jump into the benchmarks
where I'll be primarily discussing the
5775 C's performance compared to its
predecessor the 4790k first let's have a
look at Cinebench in the multi-threaded
test the 5775 C's scored 775 CV marks
which was 12% less than the i7 4790k in
the single threaded senior bench test
the performance gap was quite similar
with the 5775 C clocking in 150 to 13%
less than its predecessor of the 4790k
next we tested with Microsoft Excel 2013
using the popular Monte Carlo workflow
test the 5775 C performed well as
expected
taking 4.1 seconds to complete the task
using the 7-zip built-in benchmark we
recorded the results using a 32
megabytes Neri the 5775 C scored 20 2854
mints compared to 27,000 233 by the
4790k a 16% difference
we used handbrake to test the encoding
performance and the 5775 C record an
average of 50 point 5 frames per second
compared to the 4790k which managed 58
frames per second just shy of 13% more
power consumption is where we see the
5775 C shine during a hand break
encoding test it use just 114 watts
compared to the 166 watts consumed by
the 4790k this translate to a saving of
over 31% next we'll look at the
integrated graphics performance another
area where the 5775 C should outperform
the 4790k
all of our games tests were on the
lowest graphics settings possible just
to give the best chance of realistically
playable performance first let's take a
look at Grand Theft Auto 5 using the
5775 C we managed a healthy 40 point 4
frames per second this dwarfed the 27.3
frames per second managed by the 4790k
and was a 47% performance increase a
testament to the new IRS Pro 6200
graphics engine secondly let's look at
the results from thief again we see the
5775 see
outperform the 4790k with 31 point 5
frames per second compared to just 18
point 2 frames per second from the 4790k
this is 73% more and the difference
between completely unplayable and what I
call barely playable finally in Dragon
Age Inquisition we again saw the 5775
see perform really well at average 41
frames per second compared to just 21
frames per second by the 4790k this
works out to be a whopping 95 percent
increase and certainly takes the game
from unplayable to pretty smooth next
we're gonna retest handbrake this time
with both processors locked at 4
gigahertz by this we mean the turbo
boost feature and speedstep technology
are both disabled as you can see
operating at the same clock frequency
the 5775 C is actually four percent
faster than the 4790k with clock speeds
matched in pseudo bench the 5775 c was
again four percent faster than 4790k in
the multi thread test with clock speed
smashed in Cinebench the 5775 CA was
again four percent faster than the 4790k
in the multi thread test finally we
retested power consumption in hand break
through the clocks matched and the 5775
c used 25% less power than the 4790k
proving without a doubt that the new
Broadway l'architecte
is in fact more efficient than Haswell
at this point you'll notice haven't
shown in the overclocking results the
5775 see that aegyo wasn't the best
overclocker
it required quite a bit of extra voltage
just to be stable at 4.3 gigahertz
whereas the 4790k easily hits 4.5
gigahertz with adjustments only being
made to its clock multiplier when
compared to house well it looks like the
new Broadwell CPU is a much more
efficient as demonstrated in our clock
the clock benchmarks here the 5775 c was
not only slightly faster than the 4790k
but it also consumed around 25% less
power
unfortunately though as we found when
testing Braswell little earlier in as
Roxby buffs these new Broadwell
processes are clocked far too low to
give any of their predecessors any real
trouble the Intel iris pro graphics 6200
solution was able to dramatically
improve the graphics performance
although that page does come at a slight
price premium making the 5775 see a bit
more expensive than the 4790k well
though the 5775 did crush AMD's latest
apu it also costs around three times as
much so AMD won't really be under threat
until iris pro makes its way into
desktop core i3 and pentium processors
all intel 9 series motherboards will
support Broadwell though a BIOS update
will be required it seems unlikely that
8-series motherboards is in chipset such
as the zero 7 will support Broadwell
processors at this point
finally all indications point it's
strong availability next month in early
August thanks for watching this quick
review of the core i7 5775 see let me
know what you think in the comments this
has been Matt for Hardware unbox hit
