your host Matt and today we have the
official specifications for amd's
upcoming radeon r9 nano that we'd like
to share with you two months ago now and
be released what is by far its most
powerful GPU today codename fiji xt and
better known as the radiant iron fury X
under 4096 SPU's and aimed his high
bandwidth memory the fury ax was able to
rub shoulders with the GeForce GTX 980
TI shortly after the arrival of the fury
acts we were given the more affordable
vanilla fury featuring 3584 SP use the
same four gigabyte HTM buffer the next
GPU the land from the Radian series will
be the Radian are known nano and this
perhaps AMD is most exciting GPU yet as
the name suggests the Nano is going to
be a very compact graphics card some
forty percent shorter than the reference
r9 290x are just six inches or 152
millimeters long envy is promising what
they describe is the library quiet
operating volume of just 42 desert bells
which they're quick to point out is 16
decibels quieter than the r9 290x
although the Nano is just 152
millimeters long it's still a dual slot
card built on a black PCB it features a
full metal shroud covering a
high-density aluminium heatsink complete
with a vapor chamber and jewel heat pipe
setup which includes a dedicated heat
pipe to remove heat from the voltage
regulator despite its tiny size the nana
will be up to thirty percent faster than
the r9 290x thanks to 4096 stream
processors the same amount is the liquid
cooled fury x oddly unlike the fury ax
the Nano isn't going to be liquid-cooled
and yet AMD says it will run 20 degrees
Celsius cooler than the r9 290x given
the target temperature of just 75
degrees the Nano will also consume
thirty percent less power than the i9
290x and will require just a single 8pm
pcie power connector this gives the Nano
a typical board power rating of just 175
watts which is thirty-six percent lower
than the rating given to the fury X the
fact that the Nano features a fully
fledged fiji xt core with 4096 stream
processors is confusing for the simple
fact that the furious required a liquid
cooler to support that many processors
the key is in the typical board power
rating which as I just mentioned is
thirty-six percent lower this means the
stream processors must be running at a
much lower frequency using a lot less
voltage interestingly ambi says that the
nanos core can clock up to 1000 mega
hertz just 50 megahertz shire the fury
X's maximum frequency these
specifications to make sense the Nano
would have to spend most of its time
operating in a much lower frequency i
guess i would say 800 megahertz or
possibly a little less interestingly
also the pixel fill rate is only
slightly lower and matches that of the
vanilla fury while a texture rate of 256
gig of transfers per second is only five
percent lower than the fury axe but
fourteen percent higher than the fury
nano is also good for 8.19 teraflops of
single precision performance which is
just five percent lower than the 8.6
teraflops of the fury x Andy is claiming
that the Nano will be the fastest and
most power-efficient mini-itx card on
the market beating the gtx 970 by thirty
percent radeon r9 nano is certainly an
exciting looking graphics card and
suspect if you can keep it cool to
perform to be very strong the only thing
that remains a mystery other than the
true performance is the price on paper
they're known as should at least match
the fury performance wise so a price of
at least five hundred fifty dollars is
to be expected that's sad i'm just
guessing here so the price would be
significantly different once the card is
released some September tenth and it
will all come down to how accurate that
up to thirty percent faster claim really
is this is being mapped the harbor on
box let me know it think of the Nano in
