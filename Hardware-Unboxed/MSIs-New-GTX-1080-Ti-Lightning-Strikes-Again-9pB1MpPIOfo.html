Computex coverage and once again I'm
back at the msi booth this time to check
out their new geforce gtx 1080 TI
lightning zed graphics card firstly a
big thanks to msi for bringing me here
this year i wouldn't be here without
them if you're in the market for a new
gaming desktop pc then check out msi
high-end core i7 systems also right now
they're offering a free you play game
key for Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon
wildlands with select purchases it's
also possible to score a wildland game
code with select MSI motherboards check
out the new x99 zed 270 + h2 70 range
link is in the video description one of
my favorite graphics card series is
MSI's lightning range the previous gtx
980ti and r9 290x models were
particularly good the only issue in my
opinion was the color scheme and I don't
mean to say the cards weren't visually
appealing quite the opposite in fact
however unless you were building a black
and yellow themed rig they did look a
bit out of place this time around though
MSI is done with a much more neutral
theme using black white and silver as
you might have guessed providing the
bling this time as a plethora of RGB
lighting though I have to say MSI has
done a really nice job here in my
opinion the lighting on most graphics
cards even the really expensive GTX
1080i models looks pretty rubbish this
thankfully isn't the case of the
Lightning Zed MSI's use translucent
plastic to cover the light from the
source and this provides a really sleek
effect it's very similar to how G skills
RGB memory looks finally dodge ub
lighting also ties in with MSI's mystic
light fancy lighting aside the gtx 980ti
lightnings that it looks to be the real
deal
strapped on to the PCB is a bulky two
and a half slot cooler with triple tox
2.0 fans MSI calls this their tri froze
a cooling solution I should point out
that not all three fans are of the same
dimensions the middle fan is actually
slightly smaller 90 millimeters where is
the to either side measure 100
millimeters the fans force air over to
massive arrays of aluminium fins which
are connected using over half a dozen
copper heat pipes MSI tells us that the
front side of the Kart is covered by a
black heat spreader featuring multiple
fins this heat spreader covers the usual
components the memory ICS MOSFETs and so
apparently there's a copper heat piper
touch to the heat spreader to move heat
away from the vrm components more
efficiently MSI has painted this heat
pipe black allowing it to blend into the
heat spreader flipping the card over we
find a beautifully crafted backplate
featuring some cool looking cutouts
through those cutouts you might have
spotted a flat copper heat pipe behind
the backplate this doesn't wrap around
to the front side of the card rather
it's intended to move heat away from the
hot spots behind the GPU and inductors
this is a similar idea to what gigabites
done with their horas cards you know
that copper insert that looks cool but
doesn't actually do anything overall I
feel the backplate looks better and I
think this is a more sensible design
that will actually work by transferring
heat away from the GPU so a very cool
concept by MSI and I'm keen to check it
out to myself something you might have
noticed as we've been looking around the
card other three PCIe eight pin
connectors each capable of delivering up
to 150 watts of power so that's pretty
insane MSI has gone with a 14 plus 3
power phase design and of course this is
a doubled up design which helps spread
the thermal load on board MSI uses
international rectifier controllers and
advertises aboard TDP of 350 watts which
is 100 watts above in videos reference
spec when it comes to clock speeds the
Lightning's EDD supports three profiles
out of the box the card runs in gaming
mode which sees the cooperate at a base
clock frequency of 1582 megahertz with a
boost clock speed of 1695 megahertz the
gddr5 X memory has also been overclocked
to achieve a speed of 11 point 1
gigabits per second there's also a
silent mode which lowers the core to
1400 and 80 megahertz for a brew speed
of 1592 amilia Hertz and these are the
reference clock speeds finally the
fastest profile which is of course named
lightning and this configures the core
to 1600 and 7 megahertz resulting in a
boost frequency of 1721 megahertz around
at the i/o end of the card the display
connectivity includes a dual link DVI
port dual HDMI 2.0 ports and two display
ports there's no word on availability or
pricing it but MSI tells us to expect
more details in the coming month
hopefully I'll be able to secure a
review sample around the same time
alright guys that's it for this one
thanks for watching I'm your host Steve
and I'll catch you
