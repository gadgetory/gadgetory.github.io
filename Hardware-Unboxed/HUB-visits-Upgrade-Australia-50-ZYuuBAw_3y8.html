have a bit of a change of pace about to
go on and get out of here jump in the
car and head to the upgrade Australia
5.0 event in Melbourne the event is
aimed at PC enthuses interested in
hardware and gaming so that kind of
falls within my wheelhouse and will no
doubt appeal to many of you as well so
you get has invited harbor on box to
attend the event which is really cool
and I'm keen to try and get my hands on
one of their fire crudo solid-state
hybrid drives so hopefully I can pull
that off well I best be on my way
I really had no idea what to expect but
I have to say the event was very well
organised there are a heap of vendors in
attendance and there were plenty of
prizes up for grabs the best part being
that was free for anyone to attend at
the door you were given a raffle ticket
which put you in the running to win some
cool prizes and a drinks chip to keep
you hydrated throughout the event all
you had to do then was enter and have
some fun a number of the vendors did
have gaming PC's set up and they were
free for anyone to come and try out AMD
for example had a rising system surf and
running it was packin a Radeon rx 580
and as you might have expected it was
playing doom Kingston in collaboration
with AOC set up six gaming PC's all of
which were networked together for some
3v3 csgo action this looked like a heap
of fun I don't think I saw one of these
seats empty all night another hot seat
was found over at the Pirelli computers
booth where they had sup a very cool VR
system here we found the vibe hooked up
to an incredible-looking lan lead s pc
playing project cars adding to the
immersion was logitech's g29 driving
force racing wheel and boy did it look
like a lot of fun there was quite a bit
of a queue here to have a go though so I
didn't wait around
that said though purely computers did
have some very nice rigs on display to
keep those waiting for the VR action
occupied one such system was this insane
looking liquid cooled build in the
Carbide series air 740 and it certainly
had me captivated for some time they
also had a really cool open air test
bench type system and I have to say I've
been tempted to ditch my traditional
systems for a setup like this it
probably doesn't hurt that looks really
nice as well
heading over to the Seagate brutha try
and score some
our drives I came across one of these
monstrous ten terabytes iron wolf Pro
drives these things are designed for
24/7 operation and an ass device and at
over $600 Ozzy for a single Drive I made
sure I didn't pull aligners the drive is
backed by an extensive five-year
warranty and comes with their rescue
service as standard pretty cool stuff
and I was hinting at an upgrade for my
current storage setup then I came across
this the fire crew doe true terabyte
sshd or solid-state hybrid drive the
fire crew two drives blend the newest
NAND flash technology with current hard
drive technology for a product at
Seagate claims delivers five times the
speed of standard mechanical drives
while retaining the high capacity
storage options the good news is I now
have one of these things in hand and I
don't mean in hand like the b-roll shown
here I mean it went from my hand into my
bag and is now one of my test systems at
home I wasn't the only one to walk away
for Seagate hard drive either quite a
few drives were given out to those in
attendance all people had to do was ask
an interesting Seagate related question
and they had the chance to walk away
with a shine in your hard drive AMD also
gave away some Verizon 7 CPUs you'd be
pretty happy walking off the street for
free and then walking out with one of
those galaxies also gave away a gtx 1060
graphics card and there were many other
prizes on offer
I really enjoyed walking around and
checking out the various PC mods as mods
had three very epic systems on display I
think my favorite of all was this
absolutely incredible rocket leg rig
interestingly this thing started off
life is a cooler Master Elite 110 Mini
ITX case and no I don't see the
connection either that said though there
is a fantastic time-lapse video of the
build over on the odds mods Facebook
page so I'll be sure to link that in the
video description for those of you who
are keen to check it out apart from the
incredible custom-made case or it's
really more of a display cabinet we have
the Isuzu crosshair hero-ji school
Triton Zr GB memory AMD risin 1700 X a
su Strix Radeon rx 480 and one of those
Seagate 2 terabyte fire cruisers not the
one I nicked over at the MSI booth I
found another Oz mod system this time
carved out of a cooler master master
case 5 the aim here was to make a
compact and sleek build that stands
so mission achieved as you would expect
we do have RGB lighting here and it's
controllable via remote which I hugged
for quite some time
MSI also had their camo gear laptop on
display which looks very out there
obviously this is very much a gamer
focused product and I'm keen to see what
Tim makes of it our friends over at Kuna
also had a booth with a couple of their
latest NASA devices on display but they
didn't have any gaming PC's so
opportunity mess there I tried not to
hang around their booth too much so it
just made me really hungry and I focused
more on the desire to eat some fresh
food then how impressed I was with their
photo station software then huddled up
next to qnet we found Seagate so we've
come full circle I did find yet another
amazing build again BIOS mods the fire
CUDA typically the hard drive is one of
the few components you really don't want
to show off and you build these days
that said this build did a pretty good
job of making them cool again embedded
in the side of a cooler master master
case 5 are a Traer of 2 terabyte fire
cruder drives and just for good measure
in case you didn't realize this was a
Seagate sponsored build we have two more
fire cruisers in the front just for show
here we have a three and a half inch as
well as a two and a half inch drive
spinning around in a hollowed-out
section surrounded by mirrors which made
for another cool effect well that wraps
up my coverage of the upgrade Australia
5.0 event it was a heap of fun and I'm
keen to do it again I was extremely
impressed with what was on offer for PC
and through this it's well worth
attending if you love your PC hardware
and of course enjoy gaming finally a big
THANK YOU to Seagate for getting me out
to the event and providing me with a
fire crew sample very keen to check this
out shortly I had a great time and I
enjoyed the short break from
benchmarking I'm your host Steve see you
again soon guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
