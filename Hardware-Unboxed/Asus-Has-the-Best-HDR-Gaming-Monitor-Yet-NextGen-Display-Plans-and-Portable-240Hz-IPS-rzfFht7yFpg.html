making it possible for hardware box to
attend Computex 2019 please check out
their latest gaming and create a desktop
range powered by Intel Core ninth gen
processes via the link in the
description also a thank you to Corsair
for their support check out their new
products again via links below welcome
back to hard run box we're here at the
asou smooth at Computex 2019 to check
out some of the monitors that they've
announced at the show and in the days
leading up to it I'm really excited to
show you guys the new g-sync ultimate
mini LED monitor that they've got coming
out in the next couple of months and
there's also a 43 inch 4k 120 Hertz
panel that they've integrated into a
monitor that we'll take a look at as
well so let's get into it
first up I did want to show you guys the
new asus rog swift PG 27 uqx so this is
basically an updated version of the PG
27 UQ I reviewed last year hence why the
names so similar the key feature here is
the inclusion of a mini LED backlight
which increases the total zone count for
the full array local during backlight
from 384 zones to 576 zones in total
there are 2304 LED backlights in this
monitor each less than 300 microns in
size and then of course there's owned
off into those 576 individual zones the
PG 27 UQ was pretty good with its 384
zones but of course more is better so
with the new PG 27 uqx
we can expect less haloing out to a 33%
reduction and more precise handling of
highlights and contrast in HDR videos or
games a Sue's also claims better
uniformity thanks to next-gen LEDs and
around 7% lower power consumption it was
pretty hard to gauge how much of an
improvement the new backlight is on the
show floor but I'm expecting good things
when I get my hands on one to review
aside from the backlight most PG 27 UQ
features are also found in the new model
it's a 27 inch 4k IPS panel with refresh
rates up to 144 Hertz and uses quantum
technology for 97% DCI p3 coverage and
it sports up to 1000 nits of peak
brightness
although the Zeus rep tells me it
won't be unusual to see some units push
up to 1200 minutes and of course this is
a J sync display in Nvidia g-sync
ultimate family I did ask about some of
the issues with the PG 27 u q and
whether they've been resolved in the PG
27 uqx
the good news is the required active
cooling fans should be quieter with the
new model thanks to some tweaking
however unfortunately you'll still be
stuck with chroma subsampling when
running the monitor above 120 Hertz with
SD our content all 98 Hertz with HDR so
no real changes there I also asked about
the future of mini LED gaming monitors
in particular those with over 1,000
dimming zones as we know a soos
currently has some creative focus
monitors that hit the 1000s on mark but
it seems as though the panel's paired
with those impressive back lights just
aren't fast enough for gaming monitors
just yet also as far as future monitors
are concerned the next-generation of a
soos high refresh 4k monitors should
have no chroma subsampling issues a
company rep told me that Asus will be
introducing display stream compression
or DSC into their next monitor revisions
although I didn't get an exact timeframe
on that so while the products released
today still do have some constraints
that lead to subsampling it shouldn't be
too long before monitors hit the market
with DSC support I was also quite
impressed with the Isuzu rog swift XG
438 Q it's a 43 inch 4k monitor with a
120 Hertz refresh rate VA technology and
HDR support through edgelet local
dimming and display HDR 600
certification it's free sync to HDR
compliant and while it doesn't sound
like it will be ticking all the boxes in
my HDMI monitor checklist just the size
and refresh rate is impressive enough if
it comes in at a good price although
like the PG 27 uqx
I don't have exact pricing to share
right now a soos continues to find
innovative uses for LCD panels and
that's definitely true with their new
ROG Strix XG 17 monitor which is a
portable 17 inch 1080p IPS LCD the PAX a
240 Hertz refresh rate we're starting to
see these smaller 240 Hertz IPS panels
and laptops and he Asuza 'he's basically
taken one and put it into a standalone
design alongside a battery it has HDMI
and type-c inputs and even supports
adaptive seeing
the battery is said to last for around
three hours I was wondering what sort of
use cases would apply to this sort of
monitor but at the show floor they had
the XG 17 hooked up to a Nintendo switch
which I thought was a perfect
combination really the switches screen
is tiny and low resolution but with this
monitor you can easily hook up a larger
17 inch display and enjoy a bit of
gaming on the go it probably won't make
use of the 240 Hertz refresh rate in
that configuration but still could be
handy and for those interested a soos
are planning to release more 240 Hertz
IPS displays of a larger size towards
the end of the year I believe in the
fourth quarter
a UO one of the larger panel
manufacturers is just about ready to
launch their super high refresh 1080p
IPS panels and a soos will be jumping on
board when they are ready which is nice
to know the final two monitors I wanted
to talk about other tough gaming VG 27a
q and the VG 32 V q both are 1440p
monitors the VG 27 a q has an unusual
155 hertz maximum refresh rate with
adaptive sync but it is a flat IPS
screen in a 27-inch size so this could
be attractive to some people meanwhile
the VG 32 V Cube is your standard 32
inch 1440p 144 Hertz curved VA also with
free sync but really the standout
feature here is a LM b sync which allows
both ultra-low motion blur or backlight
strobing or black frame insertion
whatever you want to call it it allows
that in conjunction with adaptive sync
previously you had to choose between
backlight strobing or variable refresh
but these new tough gaming monitors are
the first to support both technologies
at the same time this will make them the
first choice for those that like the
ghosting reduction provided by ALM be a
soos did have a couple of other monitors
on show like the upcoming PG 35 vq + PG
65 u cube but I didn't get to spend a
lot of time with them so hopefully that
will come if I get some review units in
alright well that does it for a look at
the suits monitors unsure at Computex
2019 as sue seemed very keen to get some
of these monitors in my hands for
testing in the next couple of months so
I'm really excited for that it's also
great to get some insights about a
Seuss's monitor plans for the upcoming
quarters through to pretty much the end
of the year and some really exciting
products seem to be coming in
next couple of months so well I guess as
always you can subscribe for the rest of
our Computex 2019 coverage don't forget
to check out our patreon page as well we
love the support that you guys provide
through there and we'll catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
