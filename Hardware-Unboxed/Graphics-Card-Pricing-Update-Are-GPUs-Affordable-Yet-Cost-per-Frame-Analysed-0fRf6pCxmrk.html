tap the Bell welcome back to hadron box
today we're taking a look at graphics
card prices one of the most heated
issues plaguing the PC building industry
at the moment over the past 12 months
we've seen some absolutely ludicrous
prices for popular GPUs in fact back in
January Steve commented on how massively
inflated graphics card prices made it
difficult for enthusiasts to upgrade or
build a new PC today we're revisiting
the issue to see how the GPU market sits
right now what pricing and availability
is like relative to various points in
the past year and what the trends in
pricing are looking like I'm also going
to go through some performance figures
to show which graphics cards make the
most sense to purchase right now in the
current state of pricing so over the
past 12 months it's been basically
impossible to purchase a graphics card
at the MSRP is I'm sure you're all aware
there are two fairly simple reasons for
that one is that memory is more
expensive now than when these GPUs
launched which makes it a more expensive
to buy the HBM and gddr5 memory used on
these cards which in turn leads to
higher manufacturing costs the other is
the cryptocurrency boom particularly for
aetherium which caused much higher than
normal demand for GPUs as miners jumped
on the crypto pricing surge while
graphics card pricing was a bit higher
than the MSRP throughout most 2017
prices began to skyrocket in January
thanks to a boom in crypto mining
profitability and were held at massively
inflated values throughout February and
early March
this chart shows three pricing data
points from April 2017 November 2017 and
January 2018 for a range of current gen
graphics cards plus the MSRP of course
these are the absolute lowest prices you
could get at the time but more of the
typical sale price for these GPUs and as
you can see in January a range of
popular cards like the GTX 1060 and gtx
1070 were typically found at more than
double their MSRP it was even worse on
the AMD front with the RX 570 and rx 580
often going for
triple the MSRP while the relatively new
vega cards were expensive and almost
always out of stock you know things are
bad when a mere rx 580 is being sold for
well over the MSRP of a GTX 1080 or Vega
64 so how are things looking at the
moment well the good news is prices have
dropped significantly since the early
parts of 2018 and it's much easier to
find graphics cards in stock now than it
was back then when we add in pricing
from just a couple of days ago to these
charts you can see that the prices while
still aren't fantastic they are much
closer to the MSRP than it has been for
the entire year particularly for nvidia
gpus cars like the gtx 1066 here but
they used to sell for more than five
hundred dollars in early 2018 can now be
found from as low as 300 US still 50
dollars over the MSRP but much more
affordable than it used to be and I
should not hear that for this analysis I
did not factor in invidious recent
release have found his addition chip use
at the MSRP through their official store
it was possible to get an nvidia card
for less than the prices listed in these
charts for about a day
but stock sold out pretty quickly
instead these prices were collected
after those founders edition cars sold
out and we only looked at cards that
were actually in stock AMD graphics card
prices have also come down but they were
more heavily inflated during the early
parts of 2018 so they haven't dropped as
close to their MSRP s as Nvidia cards
have still a popular GPU like the rx 580
used to cost around 660 dollars and it
can now be found for more like three
hundred and fifty bucks there are a
couple of strange exceptions to the
price drops that we've seen over the
past month or so entry-level cars like
the geforce gtx 1050 ati and both the
Radeon rx 550 and rx 560 are actually
more expensive now than they have ever
been and in a best-case scenario you'll
find prices that are no different to
January of this year memory prices more
heavily affect entry-level cards and I
think this could be why these more
budget-friendly options are still well
above the MSRP top-end cards in both AMD
and NVIDIA have come down in price but
not by as much as other GPUs the GT
10 atti for example is cheaper than it
was in January but still several hundred
dollars more expensive than in 2017 and
be Vega cards are a bit cheaper now than
in January but they're still well above
the MSRP and while they are in stock
there are only a few options on the
market right now looking at the
percentage change in pricing illustrates
how the market has changed from January
to today mid-to-upper and graphics cards
have dropped in price by 35 to 45
percent in a couple of months while vega
cards are roughly 10% cheaper and the
gtx 1080i has dropped by 22% meanwhile
more mainstream offerings have increased
by as much as 21 percent as you will
have seen in the charts prices right now
is still a bit higher than there were
back in November and April of 2017 when
prices weren't as crazy mid-tier Nvidia
cards are around 6 to 10 percent more
expensive than there were in November
while AMD cards are a bit more inflated
than that relative to April GPU pricing
we're looking at current prices at least
18 percent higher for all but the GTX
1080 while GPU prices are currently
higher than they were in the late parts
of 2017 there is a clear downward trend
in pricing PC part pickers GPU pricing
trend charts illustrate this downward
slope better than our tables do and most
of these mid and upper end cards are
showing a noticeable downward trend over
the last month or two so while we're not
quite a 20-17 level pricing just yet
borrow no sudden explosion in the mining
market and fingers crossed on that one
it shouldn't be too long before we're
back to that point
unfortunately when comparing current GPU
pricing to the MSRP the picture doesn't
look anywhere near as nice even when
taking the lowest available price for
this cheap use most prices are inflated
by anywhere from 10 to 53 percent with
an average price hike of 31% again AMD
GPU prices are inflated by larger
amounts than nvidia cards at the moment
which is bad news for those that are
interested in a card from team red and
thanks to the high pricing of HBM and
gddr5 I'm not sure we'll ever get back
to the MSRP which is pretty
disappointing considering a lot of these
cards in our years old
the GTX 10 80 for example launched in
May 2016 and currently sits 10% higher
Bennett
launch price two years ago usually this
sort of card would be well under the
launch price by now
the RX 580 it's basically a rebrand our
X 480 and that originally launched in
June 2016 I'm not sure has ever been
seen at the MSRP outside of a few brief
moments our only real hope for better
GPU prices at this point is an entirely
new generation of cards which hopefully
should become a reality at least as far
as Nvidia is concerned later this year
okay so I've discussed how the current
lineup of graphics cards in both AMD and
NVIDIA stack up in today's prices now
let's look at which cards make the most
sense to buy right now after all there's
no point looking at pricing analysis
from several months ago or even from
last year's you know everything is
pretty much changed since then we
haven't gone through and re benchmarked
these cards instead we're using data
we've previously collected from other
reviews if you're interested in a more
in-depth look at performance of these
cards as always there's plenty of
content here at hard-wearing box that
will give you a great idea of how these
cards stack up I'm going to show six
modern titles at 1440p with ultra
settings or there abouts in both the raw
performance you can expect along with
dollar per frame values that will
illustrate which cards are the best
value using today's typical sale prices
you saw earlier the first game we have
is far cry 5 which is well optimized for
both in the video and especially AMD
graphics cards it's no surprise then
that AMD's lineup is strong value in
this game despite being priced higher
above the MSRP than nvidias cards around
350 us the standout is the rx 580 which
provides a lower cost per frame than the
gtx 1066 gigabyte though the three gig
1060 is the best value cut overall and
it's 260 dollar price point moving up
the stack would recommend the gtx 1070
TI narrowly over vega 56 though both are
goodbyes while at the higher end the gtx
1080 is stronger value than the vega 64
in the battle of inch level cards the RX
560 is great value much more so than the
gtx 1050 TI in destiny two things are
more heavily skewed in favor of the
green team the gtx 1063 gigabyte is once
again the standout for value while the
six gigabyte variant is better than the
RX 580 Vega cards don't make a lot of
sense from a value perspective in this
title falling well behind the GTX
and gtex 1080 in cost per frame at the
lower end of the scale the RX 560 16 CU
is again a better option than the gtx
1050 TI in star wars battlefront 2 we
don't have current data for some of the
lower tier cards but we will continue to
look at some of the more popular mid
tier and high-end options in this highly
optimized title the iris 580 just edges
out the GTX 1060 as the better value
option while once again the higher end
in video cards present better value than
Vega particularly the gtx 1070 TI which
is a great buy right now that said the
gtx 980ti is the worst value right now
in this title assassin's creed origins
is just one of those games that makes
more sense to run on NVIDIA Hardware the
GTX 1066 gigabyte is better value than
the IX 5 ad by quite a margin and then
that grows when comparing the gtx 1070
TI and gtx 1082 am these two main Vega
offerings the Vega 64 air-cooled model
is really bad value in this particular
game middle o a shadow of Warren
narrowly favors Nvidia in the battle of
the mid tier cards though both the gtx
1066 gig and RX 580 are great options
for this game again at the higher end of
the spectrum its Nvidia that takes the
crown with both the gtx 1070 TI and 1080
offering the best value relative to Vega
Wolfenstein 2 is the last game we're
looking at and it's a tunnel that runs
particularly well on AMD Hardware the rx
580 in this game is a much better buy
than the GTX 1066 gigabyte while Vega 56
competes strongly with the gtx 1070 TI
from a cost per frame perspective we
still go for the GT x 1080 over vega 64
though which is where the value
proposition swings back into invidious
favour we're taking the average cost per
frame across the last four games we
looked at the gtx 1066 gigabyte narrowly
edges out the arcs by Verdi as the best
value GPU though if you can find an RX
580 for $300 then it swings back in
favor of the rx 584 upper tier cards the
gtx 1070 TI is the best value providing
a better cost per frame than both the
gtx 1070 and vega 56 then the gtx 1080
is clearly better value than vega 64 the
overall best value card appears to be
the geforce gtx 1063 gigabyte at the
moment with the RX 560 16
see you offering significantly better
value than the GTX 1050 TI if you're
after something a bit cheaper in an
alternate reality where GPUs are
available at the MSRP this is the cost
per frame you're looking at when
averaging the far cry 5 and destiny 2
results what a shame that AMD graphics
cards can't be found anywhere near the
MSRP because they're definitely very
competitive if there were priced at that
price point the good news is if you are
thinking of purchasing a graphics card
right now there seems to be plenty of
stock of all models available to
retailers like Newegg and Amazon though
top-end cars like Vegas 64 are a bit
harder to find whether you should buy a
new graphics card right now or simply
wait for the potential launch of new
GPUs towards the end of the year is
harder to say we don't really know what
Nvidia or ambhi's next-gen lineups will
look like at this point and there's
every chance that mid tier cars like the
GTX 1060 won't be superseded immediately
when these new GPUs come out and then
there's also the continuing down trend
of GPU prices to consider if you wait a
month you might get a better price on a
GPU you are after but then you'll also
be stuck on your old card for longer
it's definitely a far better choice to
upgrade now than it was back in January
when GPU prices were at their crazies
though so if you have been waiting since
the start of the year there's no better
time to upgrade your PC than right now
