products such as the Nano of these
competitive prices rather than wait five
or six months and then make the product
a viable option at $650 the Nano was
very much a niche product and that that
price should have only been considered
by users who simply couldn't make the
space for the better fooled furious our
original best bang for your buck GPU
video founded on average the Nano came
at a cost of over $8 per frame whereas
the 390x cost just over $6 per frame and
the 390 less than $5 per frame
now it's priceless / - $500 the Nano
plummets to a similar cost per frames at
390 X which is a seriously good deal for
a high-end graphics card thankfully the
Nano price adjustment can also be felt
down under the fury X currently retails
for our 1000 Australian dollars and a
standard fury $900
while the Nano can be had for 850
dollars though that's still around 40%
more than the 390x asking price anyway
the point is the nato has now become a
viable option as its price to compete
closer to the geforce gtx 980
then the 980ti not too long ago we put
together another head-to-head GPU battle
featuring the r9 390x and gtx 980 AMD
came out on top providing a much
stronger cost per frame so it'll be
interesting to see if the Nano can do
the same so without wasting any more
time let's get to the benchmarks first
up we have battlefield 4 and here both
graphics cards delivered the same 59 FPS
average of the stock reference clock
speeds once overclocked to their maximum
stable values the GTX 980 pulled ahead
to enjoy a 5 percent performance
advantage the GTX 980 gets stomped in
Batman after 9 the Nana was a little
over 20 percent faster using this stop
clock speeds overclocking does help him
video reduce the deficit but even so the
Nana was still a comfortable 40 percent
faster the Assassin's Creed syndicate
performance sees the nano provide the
highest average frame rate
well the GTX 980 didn't dip as low when
looking at the minimum frame rate
overclocked the GTX 980 once again took
charge albeit by a very slim margin the
nano was able to leave gtx 980 behind in
call of duty black ops 3 and when
comparing the cars at this stock clocks
over clocking both cards
allowed the GTX 980 to catch the Neto
and even deliver a slightly better
minimum frame rate like most of the
results seen so far the GTX 980 and nano
of a similar performance at the default
AMD and NVIDIA clock specifications and
once overclocked the 980 finds itself at
a slight advantage Grand Theft Auto 5
plays much the same on the GTX 980 as it
does on the nano out of the box however
once we have a clock both cards 980 this
time finds herself well ahead of the
Nano gtx 980 was faster in Just Cause 3
but it was just one frame faster on
average when comparing the stock
configurations over clocks the 980
became 3 frames per second faster on
average with 6 FPS faster when compared
the minimum frame rate both the Nano and
the GTX 980 delivered the same exact
performance in our maps using the stock
clock speeds over clocks the 980 took
the lead by just 3% when comparing the
average frame rates testing with
rainbows succeeds we find that the nano
is able to crash the GTX 980 both focus
and margin interestingly it was only
around 1% faster when comparing the
minimum frame rate the overclocking
results are interesting as well
here the Nana was faster when comparing
the average frame rate but slower when
looking at the minimum the Star Wars
Battlefront results are similar to those
just seen when testing was rainbow
succeeds at the stop clock speeds and I
was 14% faster when looking at the
average frame rate the 4% slower when it
comes to the minimum the overclocking
results are even more extreme here the
nano is 4 percent faster for the average
frame rate the tips 14% lower for the
minimum frame rate last up we have the
Witcher 3 Wild Hunt and here the results
of very competitive though it's the GTX
980 that drops down the lowest while
sustaining a similar or faster average
frame rate as you might have expected
the Maximo based GTX 980 does consume
less power than the nano here we see the
total system consumption is 17 percent
lower with the 980 and 20% lower once
overclocked the Just Cause 3 power
consumption figures aren't quite as
extreme
he's a nano consumed 12% more power at
the stop clock speeds and just 9% more
once overclocked having tested almost a
dozen games it's now clear why AMD
reduced the price of the Radeon r9 nano
buy so much now at $500 it competes very
well with the slightly cheaper GeForce
GTX 980 which we have priced currently
at 480 dollars comparing they're out of
the box they'll stop performance if you
will we found that the Nano was on
average 6 percent faster than the 980 no
need it was only able to better the Nano
in Just Cause 3 while it provided the
same performance in battlefield 4 Mad
Max and GTA 5 giving only a $20 or so
difference in price it's fair to say
both GPUs deliver a similar bang for
your buck what have you planned to
overclock doing so you can boost the
performance of the Nano by 9 percent
while the 980 can be pushed to produce a
17 percent higher average frame rate as
the better overclocker the 980 was able
to make up the performance deficit to
come in just one frame per second fast
for an average this means if you plan to
overclock the 980 is technically the
better value option of the 2 though of
course there's very little in it it is
worth noting that we tested using stop
reference cards and while all the nanos
at this point feature the same PCB
design and cooler this isn't the case of
the 980 the reference 980 that we tested
is inferior virtually every one of em
videos boy partner designs when it comes
to cooling and even power delivery for
the GPU therefore it's possible you can
achieve even better over clocks and
hours the Nano is seriously tempting at
the revised $500 price tag but I'm not
sure I pick one up over a 980
other than it's a teeny tiny size the
nano offers no real advantage over the
980 s so unless you're pressed for space
it's not the best option this is
interesting given we found the 390 X is
quite a bit better than the 980 in terms
of value on paper the Nano should be up
to 45% faster than the 390 X and giving
it now and it costs 25% more it seems
like a no-brainer unfortunately as is
often the case it's not that black and
white and instead the Nano is only
around 20% faster than 390x I now
Ridge still if you don't plan to
overclock then the Nana was likely going
to be the preferred choice but be aware
most 980 s come with at least 10%
factory overclock so that's going to
bridge the gap between the two anyway in
the end if you're unconcerned with card
lengths but care about efficiency and
overclocking Headroom and the 980 is the
cards you get then obviously those
seeking a compact graphics card will
gravitate towards the nano as a side
note if you plan on setting up a DIY
liquid cooling system then the nano
could be the preferred choice you can
keep the card cool enough achieving fury
X or even greater performance through
overclocking as possible which will
place the nano more on par with 980ti
rather than the vanilla 980 as always
please let me know what you guys think
and be sure to let us know which of the
two you would choose if you happen to be
I'm fortunate enough to have $500
burning a hole in your back pocket
thanks for joining me again and I'll see
you guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
