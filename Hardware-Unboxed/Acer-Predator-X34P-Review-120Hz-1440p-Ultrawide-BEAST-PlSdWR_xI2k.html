unboxed since its launched two years ago
the Aesop over X 34 has been one of the
best gaming monitors on the market it's
so good that I use it as my personal
monitor for gaming and video production
because I love that combination of the
34 inch 21:9 34 40 by 1440 display with
a hundred Hertz maximum refresh rate
g-sync and even great color accuracy for
a game monitor but this new monitor from
Acer an upgraded version of the X 34 is
even better in almost every way it's
called the predator X 30 4 P and it
could be the perfect monitor to tide us
over before the HD are capable X 35
finally hits the market and a big
shout-out to p ck skier for providing
the x 34 p for our review i'll chuckling
to them below as i believe that the only
retailer in australia with this monitor
at launch so big shout out to them as an
interesting note the x 34 p has received
its fair share of launch troubles this
monitor was actually unveiled all the
way back at Computex 2016 so it's taken
a long time for the new panel in this
display to become ready for mass
production and yes there is a new panel
in the x34 p it retains the same 34 inch
size and 34 40 by 1440 resolution as the
original x 34 but it now comes with a
hundred hertz refresh rate as standard
with the ability to easily overclock up
to 120 Hertz previously the x 34 cam is
a 60 Hertz monitor with a 100 Hertz
overclock though some buyers couldn't
hit a hundred Hertz table etutor
flickering the x 34 piece solves this
entirely
it offers native 100 Hertz with that
nice boost up to 120 Hertz in most cases
and my retail unit had no problems
hitting that hundred Hertz barrier and I
hope this is the case for others as well
the other main change in the panel is a
more aggressive curve it moves from 3600
hour to 1900 ah I'm not a massive fan of
curved displays but the X 34 is so wide
that the increased curvature actually
improves the experience
with the new 1900 art curve the edges
are just slightly more in your field of
view which I like to think helps me gun
down foes more easily in games I guess
the truth is I'm probably just as
mediocre as before but you know I've got
a fancy new monitor to look at I guess
most other display specs are the same
IPS technology 300 nits maximum
brightness are one thousand to one
native contrast ratio for millisecond
greater gray response times 100 percent
srgb coverage and of course chasing
support power consumption is apparently
the same - though in my testing the x34
page uses about eight watts more power
when overclocked to 120 Hertz and about
six watts more at the hundred Hertz on
both panels the panel isn't the only
aspect of the new x34 P that's been
upgraded the design it's received an
overhaul that basically fixes every
problem I had with the original x34 the
annoying glossy plastic has been nuked
in favor of plastic with a faux brushed
metal finish while all other plastic has
received a subtle upgrade to a more
classy design that better suits this
monitors very high price tag
unfortunately the chin along the bottom
remains though this is likely a
byproduct of how the panel itself is
designed the good news for slim bezel
fans like myself is the bezels have also
shrunk marginally with the x34 P moving
from 13 mils to 10 mil on the most sides
which is in neat though minor upgrade
the stand has become more versatile as
well now supporting a greater range of
height adjustment along with a new
swivel support stand is a bit uglier
from the rear as a result but the added
flexibility is certainly a nice bonus
the modern er gods have finally listened
to my prayers here as the x34 P includes
a directional toggle for the on-screen
display rather and the awful five button
approach of the original design the
toggle makes it so much easier to move
around the OSD and make adjustments as
necessary and it's complemented by three
other buttons for quick adjustments to
the input brightness and display modes
there's nothing hugely revolutionary
about the OSD and here you'll find basic
color controls along with overdrive
settings the overclocking option typical
features like shadow boosts
and low blue light along with additions
like crosshair overlays and even a
refresh right counter most of the
additions you know I never bother using
though you might find something useful
in there the 20 Hertz refresh rate boost
the x34 pay provides over the original
model is interesting it's certainly not
as noticeable as the jump from sixty to
a hundred Hertz but it's nice to get a
bit of extra refresh rate Headroom
especially as top-end graphics cards can
push above a hundred fps at this
displays resolution these days now back
when the x34 launched it was much harder
to hit 100 FPS at 34 40 by 1440 with you
know ultra quality settings in triple-a
games but with modern cars like the 1080
TI this modern has extra speed genuinely
does come in handy
ASA generally makes accurate claims
about the performance of their monitors
and x34 P you know it's no exception
contrast ratio is around 1042 won just
slightly better than what is listed on
the spec sheet while peak brightness I
measured at 294 nets which is pretty
close to that 300 net mark a contrast
ratio of above 1001 is maintained
throughout the brightness range too
which is good to see
like many curve displays the x34 P does
suffer from a few uniformity issues
though it's not nearly as bad as I've
seen with other panels the right side is
slightly tinted yellow relative to the
center with a maximum Delta II
difference of two point two with an
all-white display this is somewhat
noticeable when viewing solid colors but
for the most part I don't think you'll
notice too much ghosting and pixel
response appears near identical to the x
34 which means the normal overdrive
setting is you know remains that ideal
option for most users the IPS panel used
here is fairly quick for this sort of
display technology so ghosting is not a
big issue for the most part and viewing
angles of course are also very good as
you'd expect from an IPS panel though
you know contrast ratio isn't as good as
you'd see from a VA display with a new
panel on board I was curious to see how
the predator x34 P stacks up in color
performance particularly as the X 34 is
an excellent monitor out of the box
unfortunately the same can't be said of
the x 34 P there with a few tweaks this
monitor can do
decent results the main problem with the
x34 p out of the box is white balance by
default the monitor is too warm with the
white point around 6000 K and an average
of 61 85 k this screws with greyscale
performance as you can see with the
Delta II average of four point six eight
and gamma that's you know it's
completely wrong on the other hand the X
34 is nearly accurate by default with a
much better CCT average that leads to a
sub 1.0 Delta a average in greyscale out
of the box which is a very solid result
for the older monitor poor color
temperatures skews color performance in
saturation and color checker tests again
producing Delta averages about 4.5 had
aces shipped the monitor with a better
color temperature more in line with the
original x34 performance would have been
great as the mono is capable of 98.7
percent srgb coverage with the following
set of tweaks in the on-screen display
you can get the predator x 34 p back on
tracks are produced in great colors no
you will have to set the gamma to 1.9
rather than default to point to as the
1.9 gamma mode actually produces closer
to gamma 2.2 in my testing you know it's
a bit strange but that's how it is I
guess on this monitor the main thing to
note is making these adjustments to the
x 34 p does reduce the contrast ratio to
around 832 1 where's the x 34 can
maintain an 1,100 to 1 contrast ratio
with similar performance that's a
noticeable negative impact from the
different display that's used in the x
34 p but on a more positive note you can
achieve pretty decent performance with a
few OSD tweaks the panel doesn't perform
as well as the original x 34 but Delta e
values around 1.0 across all tests is
still a very good result without
performing a full calibration color
temperature is slightly too loose to the
low end though gamma is fixed and only a
few color point succeed at Delta a of
2.0 even better grayscale performance
can be achieved through full calibration
using spectra Cal's calm and 5 software
in particular the color temperature
curve is flattened and greyscale
performance improves to a sub 0.5 Delta
II saturation color checker results
they're not impacted hugely with you
know Caleb calibration in most case
however with Delta e values new 1.0
anyway this is a decent place to end up
especially for a gaming monitor
however it's disappointing to see the
x34 piet unable to match the x34 at any
stage when fully calibrated my ex 34
achieves sub 0.5 results across all
tests while maintaining a decent
contrast ratio
you know it's unlikely anyone would be
able to tell the difference between this
and the results put up by the x34 p but
it's clear the older panel is slightly
better from a color performance
standpoint and more importantly comes
better calibrated out of the box this
leaves the x34 p in an interesting place
it's better than the ex 34 in most ways
it supports a higher refresh rate it's
more curved and the stand is more
flexible with a better design across the
board however it doesn't reach the same
levels of color performance it is only a
small difference after a few oh s date
tweaks but those that want the
best-looking 1440p ultra wide are
slightly better served by the older x 34
to be clear though both displays do
deliver great color performance and the
things I'm talking about here will be
nitpicks for most buyers if you want a
fast high-resolution ultra wide with a
great IPS display the x34 P gives you
exactly that while providing a higher
refresh rate and a better design than
its predecessor it's a great proposition
for gamers in particular due to that new
120 Hertz refresh rate pricing for this
monitor it is pretty interesting you
know in Australia the x34 pace hits at
1700 bucks which was the original launch
price for the ex 34 that is you know
since trickled down to around $1,300
that's a significant price difference
and I suspect we'll see something
similar in the US where the ex 34 is
currently available therefore you're
around $1000 and when the x 34 pay goes
on sale I reckon will most likely be
around $1300 in time no doubt the ex 34
will be phased out and the x 34 pay will
take its place at which point you won't
really have to think about which to buy
but right now with both monitors in the
market it's a tough choice is the extra
20 Hertz of refresh rate and new design
worth 400 bucks
I'd say probably not at this stage
though I'm not sure
how long the cheaper x34 will be around
for ether mana is a great option in the
end though and if you choose to spend
the extra cash on the superior x34 you
won't be disappointed 1440p high refresh
ultra wide gaming is pretty bloody
awesome if you can stomach that high
price of admission and that's it for
this look at the ASA Predator X 34 P
this modernist should be available
worldwide shortly but those of us in
Australia can I guess skip the queue and
purchase one right now from PC case yeah
I think there might be one of the only
retails in the world with these monitors
at the moment so it could be a bit of a
world exclusive for them anyway big
shout-out to PC case key for setting
this monitor out links to them in the
description below and I'll catch you
next time
