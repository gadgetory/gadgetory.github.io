have many benchmarks I know you guys
always enjoy that last weekend I did
look into whether or not NVIDIA GPUs
were gimping AMD rising performance as
alleged by a few viewers some were
claiming that I should retest with the
fury ax to see if horizon performs
better then say it did with the gtx 1070
now typically i test at 1080p using
quite high quality settings and throw in
something very high-end like the titan
XP as this removes at least for the most
part the GPU bottleneck this isn't true
though for the gtx 970 or fury x however
i didn't want to change up the testing
method for that video if nvidia where
indeed hampering risings gaming
performance it would clearly show as the
fury x would pull ahead of the gtx 1070
instead we ended up seeing what you
would expect to see the fury x was
slower than the gtx 1070 and at no point
indicated there was any kind of gimping
going on still in that video we saw a
couple of really interesting things
invidious DirectX 12 performance has
greatly improved and as a result under
realistic conditions the GTX 1070 looked
great in relation to the fury X when
testing with games such as ashes a
singularity
escalation Deus Ex mankind divided and
hitman for example that's that we found
some interesting results in rise of the
Tomb Raider when comparing the r9 295x2
to the Titan XP in fact there was some
kind of intense bottleneck going on here
on the horizon 7 platform with the 1800
X CPU as the Titan XP was limited to GTX
10 70 levels of performance this
limitation either seemed to be imposed
by the arisin platform or Nvidia Zone
display driver the next step was to take
these graphics cards and test them at a
low resolution with lower quality
settings to remove the GPU bottleneck so
this is what I've done well sort of a
good number of you requested that I use
the gtx 1060 and RX 480 for this testing
so that's what we've done and they
should be powerful enough to get the job
done at the proposed quality settings
those settings being a resolution of
1280 by 720 using the lowest quality
presets available I'm well aware these
aren't settings gamers use
and while that isn't the point of this
test in total we have 13 games 5 of
which were tested using both DirectX 11
and DirectX 12 the latest AMD and NVIDIA
display drivers were used and once again
we have the 7700 K and 1800 X both of
which have been clocked at 4 gigahertz
please be aware I'm not trying to show
which is the fastest CPU here so cool
your jets over the KB Lake down clock
again that's not the point of this video
and I won't be addressing comments
relating to this both CPUs have also
been tested using ddr4 3200 memory I
have some nice new CL 14 stuff from
g.skill which works great with the Rison
processes okay so I think that's about
everything you need to know for now
let's start with the titles that support
both DX 11 and DX 12 looking at rise of
the Tomb Raider we first see that the
7700 K was just 5% faster than the 1800
X when both are paired with the gtx 1060
that said though if we compare the
minimum frame rate the 7700 k is 14
percent faster now moving over to the RX
480 results we see that for the average
frame rate the 7700 K is now 9 percent
faster than the 1800 X the minimum also
extends slightly to 18% so what this
means is using dx11 Rison actually
performs worse in relation to the 7700 k
we see our X 480 now changing to the
DirectX 12 API we find a very different
ball game starting with the gtx 1060
results we find the 72 700 K is 14%
faster when comparing the average frame
rate swapping the GeForce graphics card
for the RX 480
and now the 7700 K is just 7% faster so
you could argue that we might be running
into a GPU bottleneck with the 7700 K
here at 172 fps the fact that there's an
18% variation in minimum frame rate
performance using the rx 480 and just
15% with the GTX 1060 certainly does
suggest this for those wondering these
results are based on the can benchmark
that's it I did take figures from the
geothermal valley and they do line up
with what I was seeing from a custom
pass using present Mon I can include
those results later if need be but I'll
probably wait till Vega or ice before
touching on this again moving on we have
total war Warhammer and using DirectX 11
we find the 7700 K does slightly better
with the GTX 1060 while the
1800 X was a fraction faster with the RX
480
these aren't exactly decisive margins
though so let's check out the direct x12
figures well here we see that risin
looks significantly more competitive
when using the RX 480
this is the most extreme example we've
seen yet the 77 RK was 28% faster for
the average and 27% faster for the
minimum when using the gtx 1060 and this
certainly explains our Titan XP results
seen previously
moving to the RX 480 and now kb lake is
just 9% faster on average and just 5%
faster for the minimum it's a seriously
huge reduction in margin though I should
note that the minimum frame rate was
slightly higher with the gtx 1064 the
horizon processor the division was
tested using dx11 and DX 12 but first
let's check out the DirectX 11 numbers
using the GTX 1060 the 7700 K was 11%
faster for the average and 7% faster for
the minimum swapping to the RX 480 the
average grew ever so slightly to 12%
while the minimum blow out to 12% so
when using dx11 in this title
Rison actually compares better using
highway from the Green Team that said we
find a drastically different story when
moving to the DirectX 12 numbers once
again using the GTX 1060 the 7700 K was
faster than the 1800 X this time we saw
14% for the average and 11% for the
minimum drop in the RX 480 and we find
the 1800 X match in the 7700 K with
roughly the same performance that's a
pretty interesting result right there
but let's move on and see what else we
find Deus Ex mankind divided that
provided some very interesting results
indeed and we're going to look at these
a little differently what's interesting
to note here is that the 7700 K with
both graphics cards and the 1800 X with
the our X 480 all provided much the same
performance regardless of the API used
so focus your attention on the 1800 X
with the gtx 1060 now let's transition
to the dx12 graph see that if you go
back and forth you can clearly see that
it's really just the 1800 X with the gtx
1060 that changes by any kind of
significant margin here this might make
it difficult to claim that this is an
nvidia driver issue
given that the 77 hurricane doesn't
suffer the same decline of performance
of course the 1800 ex works perfectly
fine with the RX 480 so this could point
to an Nvidia driver issue and I guess
I'd say it's down to invidious DirectX
12 implementation offloading items to
the CPU in a way that's fine for Intel
but not optimized Verizon moving on
ashes of the singularity escalation is
an important game to include as it's
been recently updated to better utilize
the Rison processes not only that but
once again we have some interesting
results to check out here we see that
regardless of which graphics card you
use the 1800 X is faster than the 7700 K
now please note I'm comparing the
average framerate figures from the
normal and heavy batches from the very
intensive built-in benchmark frankly
this can benchmark does a much more
extensive and better job of measuring
in-game performance than I could so we
see that when it comes to the minimum
frame rate the 1800 X and 7700 K are
very evenly matched that said for the
average framerate the 1800 X was 8%
faster with the gtx 1060 and 11% faster
with the RX 480
not really a significant difference
either way certainly margin of error
stuff so I think it's safe to say that
Rison is being represented correctly
with either GPU battlefield one has a
200 FPS frame cap as you can see the gtx
1060 had no trouble reaching that with
either processor the 1800 x does slip
behind with the RX 480 but for the most
part the results were pretty uneventful
battlefields DirectX 12 performance is
still a bit sketchy so I skipped that
testing for now there isn't too much
point reading into the firaon results
using the 1800 X we see that the gtx
1060 and our X 480 deliver much the same
performance again certainly margin of
error stuff so whatever reason we are
hitting a CPU bottleneck with the 1800 X
and this allow the 7700 K to deliver
almost 30% more performance with the GTX
1060 which obviously doesn't seem right
summarizing optimisation needs to be
done here that said under any kind of
realistic conditions this is primarily a
GPU bound game so a bit of a non-issue
f1 2016 is a surprisingly good game for
testing a CPU performance
here we see when using the gtx 1060 that
on average the 7700 k is 15%
faster-moving CRX 480 though the margin
is reduced to 9% that said don't jump up
and down just yet the RX 480 is limiting
the performance of the 7700 K here and a
forwarding 1800 X the ability to catch
up so this certainly isn't evidence of
Verizon performing better with an AMD
GPU Grand Theft Auto has been included
because I know you guys want to see the
results so what do we see here
using the gtx 1060 the 7700 k was 9%
faster on average and 6% fastest the RX
480 so again we are hitting a possible
GPU bottleneck looking to the minimum
frame rate this certainly seems to be
the case as the 7700 K was 5% faster
with the GTX 1060 and 6% faster with the
RX 480
not much in it though so fair to say you
are going to extract the maximum
performance from either CPU in this
title using either an AMD or Nvidia
graphics card another title included at
the request of you guys is the Witcher 3
Wild Hunt here we see once again at the
RX 480 is limiting the performance of
both CPUs and we once again have to turn
to the minimum frame rates doing so we
see the 7700 K is 8% faster using either
the gtx 1060 or our X 480 back to some
more interesting results mafia 3 always
seems to deliver those now as we've seen
in the past with the Titan XP testing
the 1800 X is able to best the 7700 K in
this title
even when overclocking the kV like CPU
to the max here with the GTX 1060 the
minimum frame rate was much the same
though the 1800 X was 5% faster on
average however if we test with the our
X 480 quite shockingly the 1800 X falls
behind and the 7700 K is now seen
delivering 6% more performance on
average and 15% more for the minimum so
the our X 480 delivers quite there below
for AMD zone 1800 Xu capping things off
we have our final batch of fascinating
results now these figures are very very
shocking indeed and really amplify the
effect just seen we're testing with
mafia 3 using the GTX 1060 the 1800 X
was just 6 percent slower than the 7700
K and given the difference in IPC
performance that's a great result
however once we swap over to the rx 480
something goes horribly wrong for
whatever reason the 18
under next fall's 25% behind the 7700 K
or 33% if we look at the minimum frame
rate I'm honestly not sure what's going
on here it's certainly very strange that
the 1,800 X looks so competitive with
the 1060 but so extremely underwhelming
with the our X 480 so are the NVIDIA
GPUs limiting risings gaming performance
well once again I'd have to say no
they're not yes there were a few dx12
scenarios where rosin did perform better
in relation to the 7700 K when paired
with the RX 480
but if you're going to use that as
evidence to somehow support the argument
that video is handicapping rising
performance then you would have to also
acknowledge that AMD is handicapping
risings dx11 performance at least in
some titles so once again it seems
everyone has it out for Eisen seriously
though we found some interesting stuff
here and it's things I'll be keeping in
mind when benchmarking the rise in 5
CPUs in games for games such as Deus Ex
mankind divided or total war Warhammer
for example I'd be sure to include an
AMD GPU in the testing for now though
I'll probably just drop these games
until we have a more powerful single GPU
graphics card from AMD likewise I won't
be testing with rise of the Tomb Raider
though I never had any intention of
using this game anyway as a side note I
have to admit it really annoys me how
much fuss was made over low resolution
testing recently it's quite obvious to
me at least anyway that this is how
reviewers should test and yet the
backlash was quite extreme granted it
was just a vocal minority making all the
fuss and based on the feedback I
received from regular viewers it was
quite clear you guys understood the
importance of removing a GPU bottleneck
for testing CPU gaming performance the
fact that we had to test at 720p using
low quality settings just to reveal why
Rison has been struggling in DirectX 12
titles when using the Titan XP or other
high-end Nvidia graphics cards just goes
to prove this point additionally you
can't blame reviewers for using the most
powerful GPU available for testing CPU
gaming performance it's just common
sense anyway what we found here really
only impacts DirectX 12 performance and
for the most part I had focused on DX 11
games for my rise in testing anyway
that's all for this one guys it's
certainly very interesting stuff I'm
keen to revisit once we have a more
powerful GPU for
AMD once Vega arrives speaking of
interesting stuff Kim's review of that
insane 240 Hertz a soos ROG monitor will
be on the channel tomorrow so keep your
eyes out for that one and following that
the next day we will have an in-depth
look at rhizomes memory performance then
on Monday you can look forward to
another video from Tim as you reviews
Kingston's HyperX revolver s headset and
finally that would be followed by our
official horizon 5 coverage so that
should keep you guys busy I'm your host
Steve see you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
