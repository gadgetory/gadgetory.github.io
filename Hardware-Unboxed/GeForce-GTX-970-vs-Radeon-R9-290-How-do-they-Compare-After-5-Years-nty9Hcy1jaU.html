got an old-fashioned GPU battle on our
hands it's the GeForce GTX 970 versus
the Radeon r9 290 now recently I did
revisit the 290 I checked out how it
stacked up against more modern GPUs but
that was more of an upgrade guide I
suppose today we have the main event and
it is a battle that I know many of you
have been very interested in and I
suppose after five years a lot of you
just want to know which GPU is the best
before that today's video sponsor is
deep cool and they're amazing anti
leaked technology featured in the new
captain 240 pro after years of research
and development deep core has created a
leak free all-in-one liquid cooler using
that patented automatic pressure
relieving radiator which as the name
suggests fence any air pressure from
within the loop to avoid leakage for
more information please check the link
in the video description
ok so let's quickly rewind for a moment
back in September 2014
Nvidia revealed at the GTX 970 for the
first time some 10 months after the
Radeon r9 290 release so the 970 was the
much newer product and unsurprisingly it
came in offering a little extra
performance at a slightly better price
AMD did quickly respond with aggressive
r9 290 price cuts but with the 970
generally 10 to 15% faster on average
and considerably more power efficient it
went on to be a best-seller
despite the vram controversy throughout
2015 the GTX 970 was typically the
punchier GPU and with a slew of high
quality AIB models to pick from it
easily
outsold the r9 290 however many of those
who purchased the r9 290 were jumping up
and down about how it would be a better
investment down the track whether or not
they were talking five years down the
track we'll never know but at least
today we can settle which GPU offers the
best performance in 2019 for this test
we have 33 games all of which have been
tested at 1080p as this is the more
suitable resolution for these GPUs and
we'll look closely at the results for 13
games before moving on to our usual
head-to-head comparison graphs the
standard GPU test system has been used
to
comprises of a core I nine nine are okay
clocked at five gigahertz with thirty
two gigabytes of ddr4 3200 memory okay
that's everything let's get into the
blue bar graphs first up we have apex
legends and right away we're seeing some
pretty neck-and-neck performance between
the GTX 970 and r9 290 this one simply
too close to call and with just a frame
minute which is well within the margin
of error it's safe to say performance
was identical using either GPU when
compared to our modern GPU we're looking
at GTX 1063 gigabyte like performance so
not amazing but given their age it is
also reasonably impressive moving on we
have the division two and this is a
title it works exceptionally well with
AMD hardware as evidenced by Vega 64
beating the GTX 1080 and our TX 2060
while the 580 crushed the 1060
so with those comparisons previously
established it comes as little surprise
that the r9 290 absolutely dusts the GTX
970 beating it by a 19% margin the 970
does perform significantly better than
the three gigabyte 1060 but even so you
will want to dial down the quality
settings a little bit next up we have
shot of the Tomb Raider and this is
another title it sees AMD GPUs doing
very well and here the GTX 970 was 12%
slower than the r9 290 the 970 basically
mimicked the GTX 1063 gigabyte or I
guess you could say the 1060 mimics the
GTX 970 either way performance was
decent despite trailing down on 290 okay
so I promised this order wasn't picked
on purpose but here we have yet another
title that works extremely well with AMD
GPUs again the GTX 970 was 12% sold in
the r9 290 this time when testing with
forza horizon for though i should note
that despite that performance was still
very playable still in three of the more
recently released titles we've seen the
online 290 doing exceptionally well
finally we have a solid win for the GTX
970
this time when testing with hitman two
using the DirectX 11 API that's what I
should just quickly point out that
enabling the new patched in DirectX 12
mode it doesn't really change things at
all the 970 was still the superior GPU
in this
title performance in Just Cause 4 was
pretty similar using either the 970 or
290 the GeForce GPU did pull ahead in
our test when looking at the average
frame rate however the 1% lower result
was identical with both managing 40 FPS
so overall the experience was much the
same moving on we find a rather close
battle and testing with Resident Evil 2
the r9 290 was just 6 FPS faster at
1080p and this meant the 970 performed
more like a three gigabyte 1060 again
not a bad result given the average
framerate was 66 FPS but this one is
still a clear win for the 290 fortnight
is a game that does favour nvidia gpus
thanks to its use of the Unreal Engine 4
this can be seen when comparing the GTX
1016 rx 580 for example it can also be
seen when comparing older GPUs such as
the GTX 970 and
r9 290 here the 970 was 18 percent
faster delivering 87 FPS on average the
GTX 970 also stacked up really well in
MetroAccess with an average of 48 fps at
1080p using the ultra quality settings
this minute was 23% faster than the r9
290 placing it basically on par with the
60 GB GTX 1060 and irx 590 so a very
solid result for the old Maxwell GPU
next up we have Tom Clancy's Rainbow six
siege and here the GTX 970 is more
competitive than I was expecting Oracle
was being a pretty easy win for the r9
290 back in the day but here it was just
5% faster on average that said the 1%
load performance was still more
consistent though the experience was
still extremely smooth with the GTX 970
and moving on frame rates were
surprisingly similar when testing with
battlefield 5 here the GTX 970 was just
3 FPS faster ik waiting to a 5 percent
margin and this is why I typically call
it a tie when the margin is 5% or less
still this meant the 970 did very well
in this title as we've seen many times
already it's often very similar to the 3
gigabyte gtx 1060
second last game tested is World of
Tanks and this is a title that generally
doesn't like AMD GPUs or perhaps it's
AMD GPUs that don't like World of Tanks
either way it's not great news for the
red team the r9 290 was still able
to live a very playable performance but
we see a 36% uplift when looking at the
GTX 970 that's obviously a rather
significant performance improvement and
the last game that we're going to look
closely at the results for is far cry
new dawn and here we have a tie 70 FPS
apiece and that place both the GTX 970
r9 290 on power 3d about 1060
performance italia peak using the ultra
quality preset certainly was respectable
and you won't need to turn down any
quality settings here now this is one
area where the Maxwell GPUs always had a
big advantage over the AMD competition
and it's an advantage in video still
holds today for what was a similar level
of performance the r9 290 drove total
system consumption up by 30% and that's
obviously quite a significant figure
this is why the GTX 970 graphics cars
typically around much cooler and quieter
than the r9 290 models okay so that's
how the GTX 970 r9 290 stack up in all
those titles and it seemed as though we
saw quite a bit of back and forth so I'm
really interesting which model was
faster overall based on what we've seen
so far I don't imagine the 970 is still
10 to 15 percent faster like what most
reviewers including myself found back in
2014 that said let's just jump into the
33 game comparison to find out what's
what well there's your fine wine working
right there
aka AMD's slow driver development
seriously though that is an impressive
comeback for the r9 290 but it is
interesting to note that while overall
they were much the same the 970 was
faster by a 5% margin or greater in 16
of the 33 games tested while the 290 was
faster by a 5 percent margin or greater
in just 11 of the games
so the 970 certainly was the more
consistent performer the smaller three
and a half gigabyte primary vram
partition heard it in Wolfenstein
especially with the settings used for
testing and then we saw that dirt fall
also favors the radeon gpus using CMAA
whilst range brigade is an AMD sponsored
title and well optimized for Radeon GPUs
aimed it also does well in the division
to Sniper Elite for Forza horizon 4 and
shadow of the Tomb Raider so no
surprises there it is mostly
older titles or in video sponsored games
where the green team does well a game
such as World of Tanks Warhammer to
Metro Exodus project cars - and
fortnight for example out of interest I
decided to look at the game's release
dates to see if the r9 290 was getting
the better of the GTX 970 in more
recently released titles while I did
only test 11 releases from 2018 you can
see that the wins are pretty evenly
split but for the 2019 titles released
so far that we have tested so the more
demanding titles released this year then
the r9 290 is thus far getting the
better of the GTX 970 not sure this
means much just yet like I said just
looking at this out of pure curiosity
moving on I decided to see how the GTX
970 stacked up against the gtx 1066
gigabyte i don't avert the GTX 970 was
15% slower so here we're comparing a
2014 release with an MSRP of $330 u.s. -
a 2016 release with a 250 dollar US MSRP
and for those wondering back when we
reviewed the gtx 1066 gigabyte so when
we reviewed it at launch the 970 was 15%
slower so we can safely say that no
nvidia gimping as it's often referred to
appears to have taken place of course in
video doesn't actively give performance
we've proven this time and time again on
the channel it's a complete load of
nonsense and plenty of other media
outlets have also proven this Nvidia
certainly guilty of prioritizing newer
architectures while optimizations for
older generations tend to come a bit
later if at all for the really old
models now if you've been holding out
all these used for a three to four
hundred dollar upgrade the GeForce RT X
2060 might be of interest after four and
a half years you're looking at an 86
percent performance boost on average for
roughly the same price the 2016 MSRP is
20 dollars higher so that's about a 20%
boost each year which isn't a lot but by
today's standards it's certainly not
terrible either and really this is your
best option
at this price point at least your best
readily available option at this price
point because yes I know sometimes Vega
56 are selling for $300
some regions but not all regions and not
Australia but anyway obviously you can
see what options you have available in
your region if you have a 300 dollar
Vegas craps card then yeah that might be
worth buying anyway in classic J's 2
cent style I digress well there you have
it the GTX 970 went from being 10 to 15%
faster four years ago to just a percent
in 2019 at least based a 33 game test
sample also despite its sarena half
gigabytes of vram the GTX 970 still does
seem to be the more reliable performer
which might surprise some of you
especially after you've no doubt heard
over and over again how it's doomed and
will be completely useless before too
long because of that limited vram buffer
well that obviously hasn't happened yet
and with a few minor tweaks the GTX 970
can carve its way through all the latest
and greatest titles at an EP without an
issue still to give credit where I
suppose credits do the Radeon r9 290 is
still extremely impressive and in 2019
it's there's really nothing wrong with
it personally I'm completely attributing
the r9 290 s come back to Andy's driver
development and not anything to do with
the partition de Vere am buffer or
Nvidia neglecting driver support fine
wine is really what it's all about here
that is AMD getting on top of their
driver optimization over the past few
years and that's really why the owner
and 290 has come along so nicely anyway
I hope you enjoyed the benchmarks in
this video and remember you can jump
over to our patreon page for all 33
graphs if you want to take a closer look
at any of the games tested thanks for
watching I'm your host Steve I'll see
you again next time
