start of our Radeon RX Vega coverage now
I would like to just quickly point out
that I only received my Vega sample
yesterday so that was on a Sunday
AMD ended up playing the role of the
courier and hand-delivered it to me over
the weekend because apparently the
initial Vega 64 shipment got a bit lost
along the way anyway those samples
should be arriving later this week and
if you are interested in a bit more
detail about how I got this card here
over the weekend check out the story in
yesterday's unboxing boxes episode the
good news is like most I was aware that
Vega would be being released on the 14th
so the second I was done testing thread
repair quickly changed gears and began
GPU testing all the data in this video
is 100% fresh I've recorded at all over
the last few days using the latest
available drivers and as usual all the
GPU testing has been conducted on my
core i7 77 or HS machine
clocked at 4.9 gigahertz for now I only
have numbers for the geforce gtx 980ti
1080 1070 and 1062 Radeon rx 580 and
fury X the good news though is we have
results for the 1080p 1440p and 4k
resolutions Before we jump into the
benchmark results I'll quickly go over
some specifications for all the Vega
models without beating around the bush
here's the lineup at the head of the
family we have the liquid cool addition
of the RX Vega 64 and this model
features 64 compute units for a grand
total of 4096 stream processors or cause
this model will operate at a base
frequency of fourteen hundred and six
megahertz with a boost frequency of
sixteen hundred and seventy-seven
megahertz that's a far cry from the 1.9
to two gigahertz in videos GPUs boost up
to but we all knew the Green Team would
still come away with a clock speed
advantage anyway even at this frequency
the liquid cooled version of rx Vega 64
boasts a peak single precision
throughput of 3.7 teraflops that's more
than the eleven point three teraflops of
the GT X 1080 Ti and roughly 60% more
than the fury X
cool model known simply as RX vega 64
has the same number of course they just
clocked 11% lower at a base frequency of
twelve hundred and forty nine megahertz
and eleven percent lower for the boost
of fifteen hundred and forty six
megahertz as you might have guessed this
has reduced the peak single precision
throughput by eight percent then we have
the cut down our x-value fifty six which
i'm testing in this video
it features 56 compute units for 3584
stream processors and that's a 13%
reduction in coil count when compared to
the 64 version all three models come
fitted with a gigabytes of second
generation high bandwidth memory which
provides a band with a 484 gigabytes per
second for vega 64 and 410 gigabytes per
second for vega 56 the only concerning
specification here is the board power
rating which sees a liquid-cooled
model slapped with a 345 watt rating 295
watts for the air-cooled model and just
210 watts for Vega 56 the base model
black version of the Radeon rx Vega 64
is coming in at $500 u.s. and that's the
current MSRP of the GeForce GTX 1080 and
here AMD says it will become the new GPU
King the limited edition air-cooled
version will come in at a $50 premium so
that's $550 all up meanwhile RX vega 56
will come in at $400 u.s. and that of
course prices are alongside the gtx 1070
meanwhile the liquid cooled vegas 64
model will come in at $600 undercutting
the gtx 980ti
by $100 in my opinion the Radeon RX Vega
56 looks to be the best value
proposition and as the most affordable
model I'm kind of glad this is where
we're starting so then I think it's
about time to start looking at those
blue bar graphs
please note because I have tested 25
games at three resolutions there are 75
graphs in this video that being the case
I will just focus on the 1440p results
for my commentary so this video doesn't
run for over an hour but 1080p and 4k
results will quickly be shown first
before discussing the 1440p numbers one
last and very important note please be
aware I'm no longer testing with AMD or
Nvidia reference graphics cards where I
can as I strongly recommend viewers
avoid these models and thankfully most
consumers do anyway so rather than test
with the gtx 1070 founders edition i'm
using the MSI gaming X model which is a
little bit faster thanks to better
cooling and a better factory
overclocking anyway I'll list all the
graphics card used in the video
description right to the benchmarks
first up we have Far Cry primal and
here's a quick look at the 1080p and 4k
results Vega 56 does trail the GTX 970
at 1080p but by the time we hit 4k it is
able to pull ahead at 1440p the margins
were slim whichever way you look at it
but here the Radeon graphics card wasn't
able to hit a leader of 5%
moving on to Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon
wildlands we see that AMD is new
mid-range to high-end contender trails
the GTX 1070 though this time it matches
it at the 4k resolution switching back
to 1440p we see that performance is much
the same technically
vega 56 was a frame seller but you know
margin of eronel so yeah pretty much the
same performance in wild lands next up
we have the hugely popular overwatch and
this is a title that was historically
favoring the green team and we find that
yet again that is the case here when
comparing the gtx 1070 and vega 56 GPUs
the gtx 1070 comfortably beat the new
Vega GPU at 1080p and 4k looking at the
1440p numbers we see that the 1070 is 9%
faster on average which is a decent win
for Nvidia when it comes to hardcore
parkour Vega 56 gets around ok matching
the gtx 1070 at 1080p though it did lose
its grip at 4k looking at the 1440p
results the 1070 was a few frames slower
so a small win here for the red team
whether you're mind controlling
messenger pigeons or moonlighting as a
tank driver either hobby is best enjoyed
with Vega 56 we saw a nice little bump
in performance at 1080p and a solid 13%
gain at 4k for our resolution of choice
of ager 56 offers 11% more performance
over the gtx 1070 which is certainly a
noteworthy gain and a great result for
the red team in battlefield 1 AMD lacks
the mad driver hacks they need to take
the lead in watchdogs 2 as a result vega
56 full
both 1080p and 4k I was actually very
surprised to find the GTX 1070 providing
15% more frames at 4k that said even at
1440p things were starting to get away
from the new radio and GPU as it was 7%
slower with an average of 58 FPS so a
bit of a disappointing result here
typically titanfall 2 has been a game
that's favored the red team in the past
so I was quite surprised to see the gtx
1070 matching vega 56 in this title even
at 4k the radio and GPU wasn't able to
run away with it we see pretty much
identical performance at 1440p so while
not a bad result for AMD I had expected
them to pick up a handy win here
another game where I expected a me to do
well was a Resident Evil 7 biohazard and
this time they do indeed come away with
a win that said Vega 56 wasn't that much
faster than the fury X in this title at
least at 1080p but fury X does fall away
massively at 4k that's it before it's
for gigabyte HBM buffer limits
performance the fury x does look very
mighty at 1440p and it's just a few
frames slower than the new vega 56 GPU
which seemed a little unlikely in any
case a win here for AMD moving to Mass
Effect Andromeda we find Vega 56
trailing the GTX 1070 at both 1080p and
4k which is a little disappointing
looking at the 1440p numbers there isn't
much in it but still Vega 56 comes in a
few frames slower typically AMD is very
competitive in this title so another
worrying sign for Vega
unlike Mass Effect Andromeda I found
that in the past
AMD's not super competitive in
Dishonored 2 and we certainly see that
here when we compare Vega 56 and the
GeForce GTX 970 at 1080p and 4k looking
to the 1440p results the gtx 1070 was
14% faster and that's quite a big margin
more crucially where is the 1070
averaged well over 60 fps Vega fell
short of that desired frame rate looking
back to Witcher 3 Wild Hunt we see that
Vega is competitive in this title but at
the same time it's not really beating
the much older gtx 1070 either it edged
ahead at 1080p and 4k but the results
weren't really well anyone meanwhile at
1440p vega 56
a few frames faster but again doesn't
really offer anything new at the $400
price point the dawn of war three
results are very much a mixed bag and we
see that here when looking at the 1080p
and 4k results the radio and GPU was
slightly slower at 1080p while it pulled
into the lead at 4k quite shockingly
though it puts forth by far its best
result of 1440p where it matched the gtx
1080 this is a somewhat baffling result
but having retested it twice I was faced
with the same confusing results not sure
what's going on here but I'm keen to
look into it a bit more shortly do it
for threw up some more highly confusing
numbers so again please take these with
a grain of salt until I have more time
to confirm them further or confirm them
with another source rather than just
disregard these results i retested vega
56 as well as the geforce ten series
cards and i kept finding the exact same
results all the quality settings were
the same and visually Vega looked like
it was rendering everything so again I'm
not quite sure how to explain these ones
for whatever reason though Vega 56 was
able to beat the GeForce GTX 1080 at
1440p and even crushed the GTX 1082 s
minimum result this goes against
everything we've seen so far so again
take these with a grain of salt until I
can confirm them with at least one other
source prayers yet another game where
Amy typically does very well and yet we
find again Vega 56 struggling against
the gtx 1070 here it's the minimum frame
rate all those 1% lows that look
particularly bad at 1080p though by the
time we get to 4k the margins are much
the same again we see this time at 1440p
that the minimum frame rate result is an
issue for Vega
despite the average looking reasonably
good Vega 56 and the GTX 1070 again go
head-to-head and deliver pretty much the
same results this time in for honor that
said while it was a dead heat at 1080p
but 1070 pulled ahead at 4k at 1440p we
start to see the 1070 edged ahead but
really we are talking just a 1 or 2 FPS
difference at this realistic resolution
for these mid-range to high-end GPUs
quite champions is a game I've decided
to include last minute and this is the
first time I've actually benchmarked
this title here we see some very
competitive results from AMD at 1080p
those things become a bit too over well
for Kay backing down the 1440p we find
mixed results Amy had the better 1% low
while NVIDIA peaked a little higher
overall performance was much of a
muchness so really another draw here you
can't do a 20 plus gaming benchmark
series these days without including
player unknowns battlegrounds could you
just imagine the comment section I mean
so many guys still can't let go of GTA 5
they'll no doubt be many many comments
asking why that title wasn't included
anyway a bit of a bloodbath here aim D
clearly has some driver development work
to do for gtx 1070 storms ahead at 1080p
delivering 27% more frames Vega kind of
comes back at 4k but at this point the
frame rates are so low it doesn't really
matter
meanwhile at 1440p ver 1070 was 24%
faster making this a very convincing win
for NVIDIA he's another new game I've
added to the list he'll blade sinuous
sacrifice unfortunately as this is a new
title and it does use the Unreal 4
engine aim D has some work to do with
their drivers Vega 56 was 10% slower at
1440p when compared to the gtx 1070 and
again it was just a few percent faster
than the old fury x another old game
that i've brought back for this one is
Crysis 3 and despite its age aim they
also have some driver work to do here as
well shockingly Vega 56 was actually
slower than the fury X at 1080p though
it did pull ahead at 4k that said it
still trailed the fury X at 1440p as it
turned in GeForce GTX 1060 light
performance okay so now we're getting
into the low level API testing and first
that we have the division using DirectX
12 here Vega 56 looks very impressive
racing ahead at 1080p and maintaining
that strong lead even at 4k this is also
sent 1440p where vega 56 delivered an
impressive 94 FPS on average making it
18 percent faster than the gtx 1070 the
hitman results are interesting as vega
56 looks great at 1080p but when we jump
to 4k things settle down and now AMD is
only able to match the gtx 1070 this is
also true for the 1440p resolution as
both vega 56 and the gtx 1070
the same 117 FPS the only Vulcan title
to be included is of course doom and
here we see at 1080p Vega 56 is able to
hit the 200 FPS cap at least for the
average framerate even at the 4k
resolution the framerate still remained
above 60 fps at all times an AMD takes
the win
looking at the 1440p results we see Vega
is able to deliver 10% more performance
which isn't bad though given the rx 580
is almost 20% faster than the GTX 1060 I
was expecting a bit more to be honest
Deus Ex mankind divided is another title
of live test using dx12 and these hands
the advantage to Vega aim d1 quite
comfortably at Cheyney P and remained
ahead for the 4k testing as well
meanwhile 1440p the Vega 56 car was 12%
fast and the GTX 1070 though shockingly
just 8 percent faster than the fury X
total war Warhammer was also tested
using the DirectX 12 API and here Vega
56 again beat the GTX 1070 by a decent
margin in fact Vega was 17% faster at
1440p though just 9% faster when
comparing the minimum frame rate finally
we have rise of the Tomb Raider and
again testing was conducted using dx12
that said keep in mind this is an Nvidia
sponsored title and as such it tends to
favor the green team even when using the
low-level api at 1440p performance is
much the same and both Vega 56 and the
GTX 1070 average 64 fps I haven't had
time to do a full battery of temperature
tests but after monitoring temperatures
for around 20 minutes Vega 56 seemed to
peak at 75 degrees and the fans span up
to just 40% which actually wasn't that
bad for those wondering overclocking
appears very limited at the moment and
I'm not 100% sure if this is issued with
the reference card or it's a software
problem it might actually be a software
related issue but as I said I haven't
really had time to work it out anyway
for a reference card it actually works
quite well but as always I'm more keen
to check out the board partner models
alright now it's time to see just how
power hungry Vega really is well at
least the cup down 56 model anyway
granted Vega 56 does push total system
consumption 13% high when compared to
the GTX 10 7
it's actually a small improvement over
the RX 580 which I wasn't really
expecting to see so Vega 56 isn't going
to make your power supply sweat or smoke
or whatever it is they do when they're
under pressure well that was interesting
it seemed like for the most part Vega 56
was either able to match the GeForce GTX
970 or was at best only slightly faster
so yeah anyway let's take a look at the
average results across the 25 games
tested before we move on to that examine
of the full performance breakdown on a
per game basis right so 1080p up first
and yes this is exactly like what I was
expecting to see overall Vega 56
delivered the same experience as the gtx
1070 which is let's discuss that shortly
at 1440p we find almost exactly the same
thing this time though Vega 56 is
slightly faster we're talking about a
two and a half percent margin here
though meanwhile Vega 56 was 18 percent
Fast and the Furious which is a decent
step up especially when you consider
that total system consumption was
reduced by 8%
finally at 4k we again find similar
performance between Vega and the 1070
Vega did edged ahead here ever so
slightly but again we're looking at
pretty much the same experience all
right let's move on to see how they
compare on a per game basis this
certainly gives us a much better picture
of what's going on and how well Vega 56
really stacks up firstly there is that
suspicious win in dirt 4 but even if you
remove that result it doesn't really
change much Vegas still 1% faster
overall so not exactly a parenting but
it's not slower either I guess what's
worth noting is that Vega found success
in most of the modern low-level API
titles with SolarWinds in the division
total war Warhammer DOS ex mankind
divided and doom it also did well in
dawn of war 3 battlefield 1 and Resident
Evil 7 where Vega 56 really seen the
struggle was crisis and player unknowns
battlegrounds and both games clearly
lacked driver optimization so we're
seeing here should be possible to
correct the frame rates in Crysis 3 were
all over the place but I don't think a
fix will be
two involved battlegrounds is obviously
a big one and AMD will want to address
the performance here very promptly
overall performance looks quite solid
and RX Vega 56 is certainly a gtx 1070
contender even if it has rocked up to
the fight banging its chest over a year
late a MDL like better late than never
am i right it is good that we finally
have some competition at these higher
price points but I feel like if you're
going to come to the party an entire
product cycle late you kind of have to
hit it out of the park and that's
certainly not what AMD have done here as
we've just seen there is still much more
to discuss though more testing with
these to be done and as usual probably a
bit of time that needs to pass before we
can really put our finger on what it is
Vega is offering consumers for example
we've seen previously where the RX for
80 was around 15% slower than the GTX
1060 upon release months later that gap
was closed to basically nothing and
AMD's offering became considerably more
attractive
whereas Vega 56 is currently matching
the gtx 1070 across a wide spread of
games i can quite easily imagine it
being around 10% faster before too long
but as a consumer should you bang Cano
Vega becoming faster ups of maybe 10%
faster and take the plunge or instead go
with a known quantity in the geforce gtx
1070 right now it is hard to discuss
value so pricing since the gtx 1070 is
selling for well over the MSRP and even
then availability is really quite poor
speaking of which i hate to imagine what
availability of vega is going to be like
over the next few weeks if not months so
in a way you might actually be forced to
wait and see how well vega matures
anyway on that note i'm going to wrap
this up for now i realize there is much
more testing to discuss but since i've
only had the card for around 36 hours
now this is all we have time for expect
more testing shortly along with a good
look at vega 64 as I complete more
testing I'll give you guys my honest
opinion on Vega but for now it's not
looking particularly exciting I suppose
that's not really a shock given what we
already knew about Vega they expect more
will coverage soon I'm you're exhausted
how you save time for a nap</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
