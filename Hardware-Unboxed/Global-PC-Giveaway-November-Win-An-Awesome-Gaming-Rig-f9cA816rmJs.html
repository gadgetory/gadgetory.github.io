am announcing a brand new giveaway up
for grabs is a complete gaming PC that I
will be building on the channel very
shortly in fact you'll have the chance
to win one of two computers the one that
I'm building here on the channel and
that will be in collaboration with Brian
from tech yes city and more on that in a
moment the other one will be being built
by our us friends from tech deals and
level 1 Tech's mister tech deals himself
along with the men and women of level 1
techs are getting together to build what
should be a very impressive core i7 8700
k gaming rig complete with a geforce gtx
1070 graphics card 16 gigabytes of ram
and SSD and much more I'll link their
announcement video in the description
below so you can check that out and then
they'll have a build as well and you'll
be able to follow my build and their
build Brian and I have come up with a
more modest build that I'll have the
pleasure of putting together although
not as impressive specs wise as the
build coming from the US guys I think
the Aussie build is still going to look
quite special I'm very excited to
building inside the fantex and to evolve
micro ATX case and this is the version
with tempered glass and for the lucky
winner we do have it in the Galaxy
silver finish so that is gonna look very
nice especially with this MSI be 350
mortar motherboard and the more that's
the more Arctic version so it's sort of
a silvery
whitish looking motherboard so that's
just going to go perfect in this thing
an MSI is also sent over there GTX 1016
that's on the Armored Core so it's a
black-white themed card so again that's
gonna look absolutely perfect in this
build of course as you have no doubt
worked by now given our motherboard
choice this is a Rison build and we will
be supplying horizon 5 1600's so that's
going to be good for whatever the winner
wants to do with the computer and that
will be cooled by the deep cool card
game a storm at captain 240 IX RGB
all-in-one liquid cooler whoo that was a
bit of a mouthful then powering
everything is this box in front of
here which is a Thermaltake 500 watt
power supply and it's an 80 plus
certified power supply so decent level
of efficiency there and then making it
look a bit special we have some fan text
extension cables so they're in white
which of course will go with our build
very nicely then we have a data who
stepped in to handle all our memory
requirements and they're supplying a 16
gigabyte kit of their xpg gamax d-10
ddr4 memory along with the xpg gam X s10
256 gigabyte nvme SSD I don't actually
have the a data stuff yet that's why
it's not on display here but it is on
its way and I will have it soon to begin
the build once built I'll install a few
games and we'll see how the newly-minted
rig handles until then feel free to
enter as it is free all you have to do
is follow the link in the video
description and make sure you subscribe
to the channel of course and there are a
few other ways there to improve your
odds via additional entries so you can
do those as well if you want all up I
think the Aussie build is gonna look
pretty cool it is valued at $1,900
Australian so although it's a bit more
modest it is still a pretty impressive
gaming rig and I can't wait to seeing it
all built so with that you guys can go
get voting I'll work on getting this
thing put together and you'll see it on
the channel very soon Armijo Steve see
you again soon guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
