big benchmark video and I am sick for
this one if you can't tell already say
if I sound a bit off that is the reason
why anyway not a big deal the show will
continue and it has to because it's now
time to compare the overclocked horizon
5 1602 the core i5 80 409 games at a
range of resolutions now if you missed
yesterday's video it's probably worth
watching that first as does talk about a
lot of things relating to this video I
basically I touched on a few things like
why I do tests at a range of resolutions
why the Vegas 64 liquid cooled graphics
card is used and I addressed a number of
misconceptions about the core i5 8400
skipping all of that information for
this video we're just going to get right
into the benchmarks please note in
addition to the Radeon rx of Vegas 64
liquid core graphics card both the AMD
and Intel systems were also tested with
the same ddr4 3200 CL 40 memory the core
i5 8400 is a lock CPU so that obviously
hasn't me to have a clocked in anyway
meanwhile the husband five six 700 has
been overclocked 4 gigahertz while I've
included these stock r5 1600 X results
for a reference
additionally the core i7 semi san roque
has also been included though note it
hasn't been overclocked the focus of
this video will be the overclocked
horizon 5 6 300 at 4 gigahertz which
will obviously be compared to the core
i5 8400 I guess the question is can the
horizon CPU deliver comparable gaming
performance what overclocked and how
does it stack up in terms of value well
we're about to find out let's jump into
the benchmarks first up we have the
battlefield 1 results and here we find
some pretty disappointing numbers right
off the bat for horizon that said I
wasn't expecting the overclocked 1600 to
be significantly faster than the 1600 X
which already operates quite close to
foggy goats for the most part here at
720p overclocking the cheaper r5 1600
boost of the frame rates by just 5% and
this meant even overclocked horizon was
much slower than the 8th gen Core i5
in fact the core i5 8400 is 40 FPS
faster for the
frame rate and that's almost a 30
percent increase essentially you're
getting 70 similar K light performance
slightly better in fact but at a much
lower price
looking at the MSRP anyway as dire as
the low resolution testing looks as the
GPU bottleneck starts to creep in at
1080p using the ultra quality settings
the Rison 5 1600 mounts a swift comeback
and is now within a 5 percent margin
there are of course two sides to these
results some will say that they're
realistic as they show gamers how much
difference there will be under realistic
conditions that they intend to play with
the other side being that it's hiding
how much faster the Intel CPUs are and
in future with faster GPUs the margin
will again open up I'm simply going to
note both sides of the argument and
leave it up to you the viewer to decide
which results should influence your
buying decision then finally at 1440p we
are even more GPU limited and here the
CPUs impact is reduced further needless
to say all CPUs offered a smooth
experience in battlefield 1 next up we
have another DirectX 12 title
civilization 6 for testing I use the GPU
benchmark I measure performance with
present Mon the test runs for 30 seconds
and it takes the same amount of time on
a pentium g 45 60 as it doesn't 8700 K
for example as far as I can tell it is a
very accurate test and this is based on
results it's given me over time here we
see something very different to the
results just shown when looking at
battlefield 1 I'm not sure what it is
about civilization 6 but the game runs
significantly better on AMD arisin CPUs
when using a Radeon graphics card in the
DirectX 12 mode it's really hard to say
if this is an indication of how future
native DirectX tiles will perform on
rise and in relation to Intel or if this
is just some strange anomaly again the
test method here doesn't favour slower
processors or some believed based on
information given by gamers Nexus for
this test we're not using the term based
AI benchmark I'm not really interested
in how long it takes the CPU to
calculate the AIS move I realize this
turn-based game doesn't really require a
high frame rate but the frame rate is
still more what I'm interested in is a
good point to how future DirectX 12
titles will perform any way similar
margins are again seen at turn appears
this is a heavily CPU bound game so we
aren't seeing much
reduction in frame rate this is again
true even at 1440 pegan here there isin
five 1600 is a massive 47% fast and the
core i5 8400 when comparing the minimum
frame rate result honestly I'm not sure
how this is possible for Aizen to be so
much faster in this game but it's not
because it's rendering a static scene
for a longer period of time
Dawn of War 3 is a DirectX 11 title and
here we see that when overclocked their
eyes are 5 6 200 processor is able to
match the core i5 80 400 at 720p the
average frame rate was only boosted by
6% over the 6800 X but that was enough
to match the core i5 processor that said
the 70s on our case still remains out in
front here performance goes virtually
unchanged at Tony P so we're obviously
CPU bound here and not limited by the
Vega 64 graphics card much the same as
also found at 1440p as well though the
overclocked Rison v 1600 just edges out
the core i5 8400 f1 2017 utilizes the
CPU about as well as any DirectX 11
tunnel does and what's overclocked well
you see fairly competitive numbers from
the Rison v 1600 it was 10% slower than
the core i5 8000 for the minimum result
but just 6% slower for the average so
not a huge margin that said the margins
do remain much the same even at 1080p as
the overclocked Rison CPU continues to
trail the new core i5 fan at 1440p the
r5 1600 delivers 77 ok light performance
and is now just 7% slower than the 8400
overwatch was tested using the ultra
quality preset so it's fair to say any
of these CPUs will be sufficient even
for the most demanding players that said
the overclocked arisin v 1600 was still
15% sold nearly 400 in this tile mat
meant that frame rates did dip 25 FPS
lara not ideal for those chasing extreme
frame rates in this title still with an
average of over 200 FPS the r5 1600
obviously provided a very smooth
experience then at 1080p we ran into a
severe GPU bottleneck as vega 64 limits
us to an average of around 165 FPS of
course the same is also seen at 1440 pay
and here the CPU isn't afforded the
opportunity to make a difference project
cars 2 is another new racing simulator
and this one is also quite CPU demanding
overclocking Rison only boosted the
average framerate by 6% investment the
r5 1600 was still 15% slower the core i5
8400 at 720p moving eternity P reduces
this margin just 9% here the r5 1600 was
good for 115 FPS on average while the
8400 managed 127 fps then finally a
1440p we ended up with the same 100 FPS
average and 84 FPS minimum for the r5 16
hundred and 80 400 next that we have
player knowns battlegrounds and these
results are more competitive than what I
was expecting though that's mostly
because CPUs with more than full cause
seem to confuse this title
well the 77 ok looks a very mighty the
only 400 is quite a bit slower in fact
only matches the performance of the
overclocked Rison v 1600 that said once
we jump to 1080p we're now GPU limited
and the overclocked r5 1600 delivered
the same experience as the 77 ok a 400
this is of course also seen at 1440p and
here this stock 1600 X also catches up
so not much else to report here really
so let's move on the Rainbow six siege
Tom Clancy's Rainbow six siege is
another CPU demanding title and at 720p
the 8th gen core series pushes over a
hundred and eighty FPS at all times this
is another older DirectX 11 title that
just doesn't play that well with Verizon
here the overclocked r5 1600 was 21%
slower than 8400 that's obviously a huge
margin the massive deficit can also be
seen even at 1080p as the overclocked r5
1600 was still 20% slower than the core
i5 8400 when comparing the minimum
result as you would expect the margins
did close up at 1440p but even so the r5
1600 is still 11 percent slower nearly
400 for the minimum result
total war Warhammer offers both DirectX
11 and DirectX 12 support but I've test
using dx12 that said even with the more
modern API the game doesn't utilize a
CPU that well and doesn't really call
for more than a quad core in fact like
what we saw with pup G it seems that
game is it better off with the 70 Summer
of Code quad core for these titles
testing at 720p showed the 77 R K to be
13% fast and the 8400 for the average
frame rate and 27% faster than the
overclocked
five sixteen hundred however once we
make the jump to 1080p framerate stumble
and now the CPUs deliver the same
average and minimum result as you would
expect this is also true at 1440p as we
are heavily GPU bound here alright so
we've checked out the nine games a
benchmark with it's time to break down
the data and work out what's what
first up everyone's favorite the 720p
data here we can see on average the core
i5 8400 was 11% fast in the overclocked
Verizon five six two hundred comparing
the minimum frame rate not a massive
margin but the 8400 is clearly faster
overall it's worth noting it also
matched the minimum result of this 7700
K so now if we check out the cost per
frame this is what we find please don't
I'm combining both the CPU and
motherboard cost to you so the 8400 is
paired with a cheap said 370 board in
the r5 1600 with a be 350 board
here we see based on the 720p data at
the core i5 8400 combo despite costing
9% more actually ends up costing 2
percent less per frame
thanks to that superior performance
overall obviously not a lot in it so
it's fair to say the 8400 and r5 1600
are very similar in terms of value
assuming you're willing to overclock the
rise in the CPU movie to 1080p we see
whereas the 8400 was 11 percent faster
previously it's now just 4% faster at
1080p this means when comparing cost per
frame they only 400 now costs 5 percent
more making their overclocked horizon 5
1600 slightly better value then at 1440p
where we are heavily GPU bound there is
zero performance difference between the
r5 1600 8400 this means when comparing
the cost per frame the 8400 is now 9%
more expensive as the combo costs nine
percent more so no surprises there okay
so based on that data worst case of the
core i5 8400 being that it costs nine
percent more and delivers the same
performance that figure is just
accounting of course for the CPU and
motherboard remember the Intel combo is
just $25 us more so for those building a
full system you can probably safely add
on another thousand dollars us to the
total and now the 8400 cost slightly
less than two percent more what I'm
getting at here is regardless of how you
look at it they're very similar if we
focus on non GPU bound results which I
feel we really
the 8400 is the better value option as
the performance increase outweighs the
slight cost increase at any P there much
of a muchness and naturally at 1440p
where we're very GPU bound the cheapest
combo delivers the most value the core
i3 8100 for example the risin 3 1300 Rex
would win here if we included them so
I'll let you decide how much weight
those 1440p results should carry now I
realize it is extremely difficult to buy
the core i5 8400 right now and getting
one for $190 is even harder however this
doesn't invalidate the results or my
opinion the MSRP is 182 dollars us and
it won't be long before you can readily
purchase the 8400 and around that price
if this upsets you so much that you just
can't get over it
think of it this way you're getting a
preview of what's to come shortly Intel
will release the core i5 8400 and this
is how it will perform nothing about the
performance data I've shown here will
change and the 8400 will become
available at around $180 us now armed
with that information you have a choice
take the red pill or patiently wait for
your local pharmacy to restock the blue
pill versus to say by the horizon 5 6100
now or wait and get the core i5 8400
once supply meets demand I know there's
gonna be AMD fanboy screaming that I'm
biased because I included low resolution
testing or I didn't base my pricing
analysis on a limited time only sale
price at Micro Center then on the other
side of the fence Intel fans will be up
in arms that I didn't use at GTX 1080i
for the testing or that 1440p limits CPU
performance and therefore AMD paid me
truth is I really just don't care either
way by their Eisen 5 buy the core i5
it's really all the same to me I'm just
trying to provide the best information I
can on the subject for potential buyers
just for fun though something a bit
different let's make a case for buying
their eyes in 5 1600 and then for the
core i5 8400 I'd buy their eyes in 5
1600 because it's cheaper Hey $25 buys
you a decent cooler or some flashy RGB
lights it's also available right now at
the MSRP or a little
when on sale and it's supported by a
massive range of affordable be 350
motherboards if you're using anything
less than a gtx 1080i or you play a
realistic resolutions the experience is
going to be similar or identical to that
of the more expensive intel cpus the
included cooler is good enough to
support a 4 gigahertz overclock with a
custom fairing kurvin most chips will
hit at least 3.9 gigahertz with the
right voltage settings horizons
efficiency is also very good the r5 1600
is very power efficient for a 6 quart 12
thread cpu speaking of which it does
support 12th Reds and that could come in
very handy in the future gaming aside
the r5 1600 even before it's overclocked
is the superior productivity CPU vastly
superior in some tests ok so there my
arguments for buying horizon I'd buy the
core i5 8400 because it's the stronger
gaming CPU for the vast majority of
titles available right now a stronger
low resolution performance could point
to it being a better CPU down the track
and a bit of pairing for future
generation GPUs those rocking a high
refresh rate gaming monitor right now
will surely be better served by the 8400
it's also a beast out of the box there's
no need to fine-tune or overclock I mean
you can't but you're getting superior
performance in games anyway all those
dead 370 motherboards I have the only
option right now that combo is only
slightly more expensive and it provides
a flexible upgrade path in the future so
it might not even be worth saving the 30
to 50 dollars on a B 360 board for a lot
of gamers in the end the 8400 is a
simple yet powerful option for gamers
okay so that's me looking at this as
objectively as I can you can certainly
make a strong case for by either Verizon
v 1600 or the core i5 8400 the only
hiccup being that while you can purchase
the rise in CPU right now you can't
the 8400 this could all change in the
coming weeks so let's just not
complicate the issue with that
availability mess you'll have to cross
that bridge when it comes time to
upgrade or build your new gaming PC you
have the performance data and you've
seen how that translates when measuring
the cost per frame based on the u.s.
MSRP if pricing is different in your
region take the
average data and recalculate that it's
based on your pricing it's really that
simple I'm not sure there's much more
that needs to be said or can be said for
now on the subject so let's leave it
that I'll continue to compare these two
CPUs and new games as they arrive and
monitor how things evolve I realize
there's a few new games right now that
do need to be tested and you can bet I
am testing them as we speak kind of for
now though I'm your host Steve apologies
for my voice again I know it's a bit
painful for this one but there's nothing
I can do about it
I'll catch you on another video real
soon thanks for watching like subscribe
