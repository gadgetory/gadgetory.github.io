Rainbow six releases and fans of the
series have been salivating a receipts
for some time
the strategic FPS shooter is polarizing
it's slower paced tactical gameplay is
so different to the run-of-the-mill Cod
style shooter that some people hate it
but a very devoted fanbase simply loved
it this is what makes it special in
similar fashion to the also recently
released Star Wars Battlefront game
siege for go is a single-player campaign
and instead focuses on team-based
multiplayer action you do however get a
series of training missions or
situations to tackle alone and gamers
will be very pleased to see the return
of the popular cooperative terrorist
hunt missions
Rainbow six siege has been built on the
anvilnext 2.0 game engine it's the same
engine used by the recently released
Assassin's Creed syndicate so visually
you were hoping for an impressive
looking game developer Ubisoft promises
that PC gamers will enjoy enhanced
graphics and a video is quick to point
out this is due to their involvement
with advanced game works effects
thankfully Rainbow six siege doesn't
appear to be too heavily infected with
game works and the user is free to pick
and choose which setting they use
without facing a significant impact on
performance or image quality take the
ambient occlusion options for example
Rainbow six siege features and videos
HPA o plus as well as Ubisoft our own
SSB ce SS BC was first showcased in Far
Cry 4 and is an ambient occlusion
technique that utilizes up to 12 samples
eight of which have been used in Rainbow
six siege this method is said to be a
significant improvement over SSAO
which has been used by Ubisoft in the
past alternatively gamers can offer HB
AO Plus which in video says delivers
superior image quality particularly over
long distances
personally I prefer the look of HB o
applies but I wouldn't say it outright
superior to SSB
so I recommend you play around with both
it's super picky about the image quality
there are a number of post process
anti-aliasing and multi sample
anti-aliasing options to choose from as
well for testing we've decided to use
temporal anti-aliasing or taa for short
with temporal filtering in videos HBO
plus has also been enabled while all
other quality statements have been maxed
out something we really liked about
Rainbow six siege is the built in
benchmark it's quick and easy to run and
allows gamers to quickly work out which
settings work best on their system it
also makes it easy to compare your
results of my own the average of three
runs were taken for each card of each
resolution and here's a look at the
built in benchmark Before we jump to the
results
Loen card owners we pleased to see that
they can run rainbow succeed at maximum
quality and still get a minimum well
over 30 FPS and an average of 56 frames
per second or higher it's interesting to
see the 4 gigabyte r9 380 our
performance 2 gigabyte equivalent by
more than 10% this is the biggest margin
we've seen between the two cards in any
game while delivering actual playable
performance from the GTX 970 and up if
you have a 1080p screen then you'll be
probably wanting to enable msaa for a
more accurate image that said if you're
rocking a high refresh screen then the
100 FPS + average frame rate will be
welcomed at 1440p most gamers won't be
satisfied with anything less than GTX
970 which was able to produce a minimum
of 38 fps and an average of 62 fps a
tolerant gamer might push for 1440p with
the 380 X but anything below that and
you're in console town it was surprising
to see both the r9 fury and Arnone fury
apps outperforming the 980 TI especially
a siege is an Nvidia sponsored title
it's interesting to see such a large
Delta between the minimum and average
frame rates in the built-in benchmark
this isn't something we saw when playing
Rainbow six siege the averages are
similar to what we saw but the frame
rates never dipped the lows that we saw
in the benchmark that said I'm yet to
play every possible scenario playing any
game with the minimum below 30fps is
tough in my opinion so at 4k I'd really
only consider the game possibly playable
with the 4 cards at the top of our graph
the 390 X was the over performer here
with a minimum of 29 FPS rendering of
one frame ahead of the 980ti and only
falling four frames shy in terms of
average although at around the 40 FPS
mark these are important frames per
second the are no fury and fury acts
were the only cards able to get their
minimums above 30
Rainbow six siege performs really well
on current generation cards right from
the bottom up when you're playing a
1080p
the visuals won't blow you away like a
heckler &amp;amp; koch m320 but it's still a
pretty good-looking game that keeps the
classic Rainbow six look and feel the
good news is the game plays extremely
well and mid-range to low-end hardware
and those playing at 1080p
we'll find the i9 380 and gtx 960 more
than sufficient moreover unlike recently
tested games such as just for 3 and
fallout 4 the cpu doesn't play a
critical role and those rocking a core
i5 or i7 processor will receive similar
performance to those using an FX series
processor finally a big shout-out to
Ubisoft for making all dlc free take
note other publishers that may or may
not begin with e and end in a this is
how it's done now that I'm done testing
I'm excited to dive in and hunt some
terrorists on me thanks for watching
