full system giveaway this time I'll be
putting together what should be a very
cool-looking mid-range gaming PC valued
at around $1,100 a us so it'll pack a
fair punch we have some pretty cool
hardware on offer here as well so at
Verizon 5 1600 X 16 gigabytes of RGB
memory we have an SSD heaps of cool
cooler master here the sous RX 470 Strix
graphics card and yeah a few other bits
and bobs now this is just one of 3 pcs
that we'll be giving away in this
competition the other two had been built
by greg of science studio and brian of
Czechia city those build videos can be
found on their channel so be sure to pop
on over and check them out anyway I
think it's about time we build the
hardware unboxed version of the giveaway
PC so let's get to it as usual I will be
slapping this thing together on camera
and talking about the various bits and
pieces as we do it and then I'll be able
to clock it because we do have the
master liquid 120 so the process should
have a clock to at least 4 gigahertz
with that that'll be good to see and
then of course I will show you guys how
capable the system is by playing a
couple of games we'll set a monitor up
and play overwatch and a few other
titles so that should be really cool and
finally before we jump into it just a
quick thank you to a few other companies
who have made this giveaway possible AMD
for providing a Rison 5 1600
Coolermaster providing pretty much
nearly all the hardware and then team
group you've sent along we are really
cool t force memory and an SSD for
installing windows but like I said we'll
cover all that in a minute let's go get
to it
from AMD we have the horizon 5 1600 X as
I mentioned and from team group we have
they're super awesome looking key Force
Nighthawk RGB memory a 16-2 you buy ddr4
3000 kit no less and they also sent
along their smart little owl 5 light 2.5
inch 240 gigabyte SSD to use as the boot
drive then cool a master came to the
rescue with their incredibly good value
master box like 5 case v6 50 semi
modular gold certified power supply
master liquid 120 all-in-one liquid
cooler and 4 of their impressive-looking
master
fam Pro 120 air Balance RGB fans harbour
unboxed is then donating the as rock
fatality a be 350 gaming K for
motherboard and the Isuzu ROG Radeon RX
470 Strix graphics card to the build the
RX 470 is really the best we can do
right now though it is a very capable
graphics card anyway
typically the RX 470 should retail for
around 170 dollars us but right now they
are selling for over $300 u.s. and even
then they are still quite hard to come
by so technically this is the most
expensive component in my bills anyway
let's jump to the build and reconvene
for a little overclocking and then some
daemon
you
you
well I think that came together rather
well I know I'd be certainly very happy
to win this gaming rig now that it's all
up and running I've jumped into the bias
for a little bit of overclocking here we
want to navigate to the second tab which
is titled Oct cur then you want to set
the CPU frequency and voltage change
option from auto to manual here the CPU
frequency value in megahertz is set to
3600 by default I simply change that
figure from 3600 to 4,000 and now all
cores will be running at 4 gigahertz
I left the voltage at the standard 1.37
5 volts and this was set by asrock after
that I saved the setting from an exit of
the BIOS the system memory booted and
loaded into Windows with the CPU running
all cores at 4 gigahertz time then to
play some games and see how the Rison 5
1600 X and Radeon rx 470 get on at 1080p
ah
ah
get over here - yellow 16.6
we'll get WITSEC so oppressed don't cut
right six internet portal opens keep in
front 50 in right over crest
