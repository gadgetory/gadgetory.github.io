system which would have seen an entire
lap spilled now it's time to assemble
the Intel Core i5 rig the key changes
other than the processor will obviously
be made to the motherboard and this time
the asrock said 170 ax has been used
I initially picked this board because it
was one of the cheapest to support
non-chaotic overclocking at ninety
dollars but since that feature has been
scrubbed you could save a little extra
and get an h1 70 motherboard moving on
the Sapphire r9 390 has been swapped for
the HIAS r9 390 as it suits build better
and pair of black Crucial Ballistix
elite memory modules has been used
unfortunately I couldn't get a blue or
white set in time for the build I've
used the same model close-loop liquid
cooler storage drives and power supply
that we use from the AMD build in this
Intel build too so that any further ado
let's build this beast inside our custom
painted silver soon k low-five last week

last week I put together the AMD FX

assemble the Intel Core i5 rig the key
changes other than the processor will
obviously be made to the motherboard and
this time the as rocker said 170 ax has
been used I initially picked this ball I
really liked how the AMD build came out
last week the customer paint job and the
cheap $2.00 LED lights troops came up to
treat create what was a truly unique
gaming system without breaking the bank
having said that I think the Intel build
might look even better the white
interior glows nicely with the LED
lights the blue exterior is very unique
which build did you guys prefer the look
of next week I'll be providing the final
part of this series where these two
systems go head-to-head in a gaming
benchmark battle all the parts featured
in this build we listed in the
description that along with our
affiliate Amazon links if you'd like to
support the channel and pick something
up
I'll also list alternative hardware
options such as an air cooler and
smaller capacity power supply there too
for those of you they'd like to spend a
little less on the entire system if you
have any questions at all then please
let me know in the comments or on our
forum at Hardware unbox calm I'm your
host Matt as always and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
