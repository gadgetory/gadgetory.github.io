what is going to be another big
benchmark video this time I am focusing
on risings gaming performance previously
or my rising day 1 review I only covered
4 games and only tested at 1080p which
is generally how you test but let's not
go into that point again anyway for this
one fortunately I have tested 16 games
that not just turn a DP but also 1440p
also added to the testing your results
for the 1800 X and 1700 X with SMT
disabled longtime subscriber yack has
pointed out a very unique problem with
the Windows 10 scheduler for Rison
processes which was discovered by some
users over on the anon tech forums
apparently Windows 10 treats all rise
and threads the same not identifying SMT
from physical cause this means Windows
thinks all threads have access to their
own level 2 and level 3 cache I'll touch
on this a bit more another video soon
but for now this is why SMT can hurt
performance in some situations for these
updated results I built a brand new test
system around the gigabyte X 370 gaming
5 motherboard and strapped on the ek xlc
predator 240 all-in-one liquid cooler
for good measure the gaming 5 was
updated with the latest f3f BIOS
revision and my corsair ddr4 memory was
indeed running at 1.5 gigahertz for a
double data rate of 3000 mega transfers
per second this then is showing Rison in
the best possible light in its current
condition and this is indeed the
performance you guys as consumers can
expect to see for some reason a vocal
minority which are obviously AMD fans
have been calling for reviewers to stop
testing Rison until it has time to
mature
that's a strange request I have to say
if aimday were to pull sales until
they're happy with where aizen's at then
it might make sense anyway guys I'm not
going to stop retesting rise and expect
constant updates there are so many more
different tests I want to do and of
course has claims of improved
performance arm 8 I will be
investigating those right away hopefully
we'll be able to closely monitor aizen's
gains over the next few weeks months
several months and so on
there's no point saying don't test riser
now in games as they aren't optimized
for it
hardly going to run a few game tests now
and call it a day and shut the book on
Rison I think most of you guys know me
better than that by now I'm going to be
doing so much horizon testing I could
dedicate a separate channel to all the
data I will be collecting so with the
results from 16 games now in at two
resolutions featuring 11 different
processes plus the two disabled SMT
configurations we have a total of 416
results to look at from at least twelve
hundred and fifty individual benchmark
runs gathering all that data took around
four full days of work thankfully I had
the foresight to test the Intel
processes in advance just before Verizon
arrived anyway that's all behind me now
let's get to the results starting with
the division we find a rather severe GPU
bottleneck even at 1080p
when using the ultra quality settings of
course it's not until we look at the
dual-core Intel chips or the AMD FX 8350
40 P resolution looks much the same the
dual-core Intel chips catch up for the
average framerate but still like ever so
slightly when looking at the minimum
needless to say their eyes and CPUs all
do very well here next up we have hitman
which I have tested using DirectX 11 in
terms of performance the rise in CPUs
are similar to the core i7 59 60 X which
makes them a good bit slower than the 60
900k 6700 K and 7700 K processors
performance is slightly better than the
unlocked Core i5 skylake and KB Lake
CPUs and disabling SMT support doesn't
have much of an impact on performance
here though did afford us a few extra
frames moving to 1440p we find some
interesting changes in the results
that's how they are mostly expected
naturally as the GPU becomes the more
performance limiting factor margins
between the CPUs narrow the 1800 X for
example is now just 11% slow in the 1600
K where it was 19% slower at 1080p
overall strong performance on the rise
and CPUs here as they roughly match the
59 60 X the Civilization six numbers
might seem surprising but AMD Zone
Review guide which they shared with
media showed rising to be quite a bit
down on performance here in relation to
the Intel CPUs still the performance was
far from poor as the 1800s
was just 10% slower than 600k at 1080p
jumping to 1440p the results don't
change much the 1,800 X is still 10%
slower than the 1600 K which is
obviously a commendable effort and a
solid result for AMD I have tweaked my
testing methodology for overwatch ever
so slightly I now run a 12 player bot
match while spectating the bots are set
to the easy difficulty and I use the
Zarya character on the Ilyas map once
the bots from opposing teams meet in the
middle of the map or somewhere around
there the battle takes place and I start
my test which runs for five minutes
because the bots are set to easy and the
character that I'm using they don't
actually ever seem to be able to kill
each other so it's just an all-out
non-stop battle it actually provides
really nice accurate results and as
always I take the average and minimum
frame rates as an average from three
runs the only other change made to the
testing has been the upgrade from the
ultra quality preset to the epic quality
preset which helps to knock the frame
rates down from that 300 FPS cap at
1080p we see like my previous test the
Rison processes don't look particularly
impressive when looking at the average
frame rate albeit they are plenty fast
enough to drive a 144 Hertz display in
this title still what's important to
note here is the minimum frame rate out
of the box the 1800 X isn't much slower
than the 59 60 X meanwhile with SMT
disabled it actually pulls ahead so then
we have a good example here of why the
window scheduler really needs to be
updated for the horizon processes now at
1440p we see Rison becomes very
competitive the 1800 X pulls ahead of
the 59 60 X out of the box and this time
disabling SMT doesn't lead to the same
big gains for the minimum frame rate I
have to say both the 1800 X and 1700 X
CPUs look really good here for some
reason in Mirror's Edge catalyst the
rise and CPUs hit a bit of a wall albeit
at well over 100 FPS the 60 100k went on
to averaged 146 fps while the Rison
processes seemed to stop at around 138
fps the good news is though this made
them just 5% slower moving to 1440p the
results tighten up and now the rise in
process is just 2 percent slower than
the 16 are ok while matching its minimum
right so we are seeing rising pretty
well get the most out of the Titan XP at
1440p in Mirror's Edge catalyst mafia 3
has some very interesting figures for us
first and foremost rising can be seen
kicking some serious silicon here this
is one of the very few games where you
will see Broadway Lee smoking kb lake
the 1800 x gets right amongst at
matching the 5960 x2 tail a 69 hundred k
by a very slim margin and these are
1080p results it's also interesting to
note that disabling SMT actually hurts
performance as the 1800 X becomes 7
percent slower things get even more
interesting at 1440p here the 1800 X
actually takes the top spot on our graph
granted it is just 1 FPS ahead of the
1600 K and 5960 X this is still well
within the margin of error but a great
result nonetheless again disabling SMT
hurts performance by quite a bit in
mafia 3 performance when testing with
Gears of War 4 is better with SMT
disabled the minimum frame rate is
slightly improved while we see decent
gains for the average frame rates
overall though Rison looks quite average
at 1080p as it trails the 59 60 X and
struggles to match the minimum frame
rate of the core i5 7600 K now at 1440p
the rise in cpus look much more
competitive and while the average frame
rate is a bit slower then you might have
hoped for the average is still quite
strong I have to say the rise in cpus
look a bit lost in Deus Ex mankind
divided as both the 1800 X and 1700 X
for behind the 59 60 X by at fair margin
that said turning SMT off does boost the
average frame rate significantly in this
title though only the minimum remains
much the same overall not a great
showing in this DirectX 12 title at
1080p which is quite strange given how
closely AMD worked with the developer
obviously AMD focus on optimizations for
Polaris but you thought they might
revisit the game for Rison in any case
upping the resolution to 1440p using the
very high quality settings we run into a
GPU bottleneck and now horizon looks
quite impressive disabling SMT also has
no impact on performance here yet more
interesting results this time when
testing with battlefield 1
here the 1800 X is just 8% slower than
the 1600 K for the average result and
10% style for the minimum so a decent
result disabling SMT didn't impact the
average frame rate but the minimum was
23% lower on the 1800 X which is very
interesting
moving to 1440p the 1800 X and 1700 X
looked a very competitive as they
roughly match the 7700 K and 16 900 k f1
2016 runs better with SMT disabled here
we see a 7% boost for the average frame
rate at a massive 16% increase for the
minimum with SMT disabled the 1800 X is
roughly on par with the 59 60 X and just
7% slower than the 60 100 K moving to
1440p we find yet more interesting and
this time confusing results here
disabling SMT slightly reduces
performance go figure
anyway out of the box the 1800 X was on
par with the 69 hundred K although the
Rison processors look very weak in total
war Warhammer this is clearly again that
doesn't require more than four cores as
evident by the core i5 versus 1600 K
results that being the case it's not
surprising to find that disabling SMT
here leads to considerable performance
gains in fact with SMT disabled the 1800
X actually pulls ahead of the 1600 K
whereas previously out of the box it was
8% slower moving to 1440p the results
between the Broadway Lee and rise and
CPUs is much the same with the added GPU
load the skylake and cable 8 processors
don't enjoy quite the same lead as they
did at 1080p again the rise in CPUs look
average at 1080p when compared to the
600 K and of course Core i5 and core i7
KB Lake CPUs this time when testing with
grand theft auto 5 Rison was faster with
SMT disabled in GTA 5 though the gains
weren't large enough to really better
their position now at 1440p Rison does
look more competitive and with SMT
disabled the 1800 X roughly matches the
69 hundred K
watchdogs to results are a little
confusing because despite all 16 threads
on the rise and CPU is being heavily
utilized the performance isn't that
impressive the 6100 K and
59 60 X for example crush the quad core
Core i7 chips yet Rison doesn't enjoy
the same gains obviously this is an
optimization issue even at 1440p we see
that Rison isn't terribly competitive
and watchdogs too which is a shame again
hopefully something can be done to
better support and is rising CPUs in
this title ARMA 3 isn't a game I really
like to test with but after all the
passionate requests I received on my
rise in review I feed you guys might
burn the channel to the ground if I
excluded it again despite poor
utilization the 1800 X actually looks
quite good in relation to the 1600 K
though unsurprisingly the higher clocked
cabe you like and skylake chips offer
much better performance in this title
the 1440p results are much the same
though the 1600 K and Rison CPUs are
more competitive with the core i5s here
Far Cry primal is in a particularly CPU
demanding game and it doesn't utilize a
large number of threads out of the box
despite offering smooth performance the
Rison 7 1800 X and 1700 X are actually
seen to be slower than the pentium g
4560 however disabling SMT support boost
performance by 14% and now the 1800 X is
on par with the 6100 K the 1440p results
are more competitive and again with SMT
disabled the 1800 X is able to rub
transistors with the 6900 K see I told
you guys I would get a 4 on a CPU
benchmark done this counts right
anyway like Far Cry this isn't a CPU
intensive game that said rise and CPUs
do rather well here and beat up the 6900
K moving to 1440p we had a hard GPU
bottleneck with the Titan XP so the
results are very much shaped to you ok
so this is by no means conclusive data
but I know many of you really liked it
when I take all the games tested and
provide the average performance in one
nice easy to read graph so here we are
from the 16 games tested we see that
disabling SMT on the 1800 x ended up
delivering an average of 3% more
performance for the average framerate
and just 1% for the minimum so overall
not a big difference of course the
effectiveness of turning SMT off at this
point did vary quite a bit from game to
game hopefully before too long gamers
will be able to leave SMT on without
having to worry about losing
moments in certain games out of the box
the rise in seven 1800 X was on average
twelve percent slower than the six Niner
okay and that seems in line with what we
found originally at 1080p so not much
else needs to be said here then moving
to 1440p the 1800 X is now just 4%
slower than the 69 oh okay
so a huge improvement with the Titan XP
with SMT disabled the 1800 X came out on
power the 6600 K and 59 60 X so overall
quite good results were seen at 1440p
but remember we are kind of running into
a GPU bottleneck here so I'll let you
guys argue about which resolutions more
useful disabling SMT sent performance
backwards in ARMA 3 battlefield 1 mafia
3 and watchdogs 2 meanwhile it boosted
performance in Deus Ex mankind divided
f1 2016 Far Cry primal Gears of War for
Grand Theft Auto overwatch and total war
Warhammer all these games play better on
the horizon with SMT disabled though
mileage did vary finally much the same
performance was seen in Civilization 6
for on a hitman Mirror's Edge catalyst
and the division the key thing to note
here when looking at the Intel CPUs is
the fact that at 1080p the 1800 x
trailed the 600 K by 12% of course once
we move to 1440p that figure shrunk to
just 4% I think you can guess what will
happen at 4k so what have we learnt well
honestly not much compared to the
original review the findings are all
sort of in line with that we just have a
bit more data now and we've seen that
there are places where Aizen does do
very well so now we are waiting on
optimisation to sort of enhance the
overall experience if you will and that
will come from things like you know
board partners improved biases Microsoft
will improve their operating support no
doubt and game developers as well so
hopefully ambi can work closely with
game developers to better support
Rison so I believe all that's coming and
AMD promise that is that it is and I
don't think we have another bulldozer
sort of situation on our hands where
promises are made and they're not really
followed through with I think aim D has
a real winner on their hands with
Verizon speaking of operating system
support the first really useful step
would be a fix SMT support and that
should be a fairly easy step to
accomplish and doing so will really
improve performance especially in games
and I know that last graph where I
compiled all 16 games and just looked at
the average frame rate or the average
frame rate the minimum frame rate and
disabling SMT didn't look particularly
useful there but that's because in some
games disabling SMT actually hurt
performance so once the operating system
is optimized for SMT we should see
really strong improvements right across
the board and SMT itself will be more
efficient but then when it's not able to
be utilized the operating system won't
be grabbing threads instead of physical
cores so we will see better performance
so as I said originally the cheapest
tries in CPU being the 1,700 without the
X is going to be a great option for
those not interested in high refresh
rate gaming and want to either game at
4k or with a more reasonable mid-range
GPU for those scenarios I think I
personally would pick the 1700 over the
7700 okay as it feels like a safer bet
long term and of course right now
productivity is much stronger of course
the other side of that being if you're a
gamer that was targeting 1080p or 1440p
144 Hertz
high refresh rate gaming then I feel
like a KB like 7700 K or the skylake 67
or okay would probably be a better
choice as I've already said I will be
following risings development or how it
matures very closely doing a lot of
testing and reporting that data back to
you guys so there's going to be plenty
more rise and testing to come and I also
there's some different kind of testing I
want to do as well when I get time so
there will be plenty more rise in
benchmarks but I'm not going to make
this rise and unboxed the channel won't
be changing to a rise in benchmark
channel there'll be plenty of other non
rise and related content as difficult as
there's going to be at the moment
because I'm so excited about rising and
want to test so many different things
but yeah there'll be other content to
come but there will be a Rison system
coming and I don't mean a rise and build
for me it's more for you guys or one
lucky you guys I will be building a
rising 1800 X system full system really
cool
case graphics card motherboard obviously
the process of the whole lot and that
will be for a giveaway for one lucky
subscriber so be sure to keep your lids
peeled for that because there will be
more details to come anyway that's all
for now I'm your host Steve thanks for
watching hope you enjoyed the benchmarks
and I'll catch you next time
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
