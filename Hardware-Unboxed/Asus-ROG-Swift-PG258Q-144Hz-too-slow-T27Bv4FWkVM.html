I'm boss
today we'll be taking a look at the
Isuzu rog swift PG two five a two this
is a twenty four point five inch 1080p
TN LCD monitor now you may be thinking
that those specs aren't too impressive
but this monitor has one key feature and
that is its refresh rate it has a
maximum of 240 Hertz with g-sync
variable refresh rate support so it's
definitely designed for people that want
to do high refresh rate gaming and
professional gamers that want low
latency I'm going to dive right into the
design of the PG 2 582 to begin with and
it's not a particularly small 24.5 inch
monitor the display section is
reasonably thick and the stand takes up
quite a bit of space on your desk thanks
to those large three legs that support
it and the quite sizable pillar that
holds up the display itself there's a
number of gamers style elements around
the body as well including V well a very
interesting pattern that you'll see on
the back as well as the Republic of
gamers logo on the back of the pillar
and the kind of odd LED illuminated logo
that comes out from the bottom of the
stand
um seems to be that most of you guys
think that that is a gimmick when I
asked you on social media and I tend to
agree but luckily you can both customize
this by changing out the little clear
insert that goes into the bottom of the
stand and also you can disable the
feature entirely if you're not a huge
fan of it the PG 2 5 8 Q does look quite
nice in the front though and it's slim
bezels allow you to easily use it in a
multi-monitor setup without much gap
between the displays the stand supports
a wide range of position adjustments
that will be very useful for most people
you get both height tilt swivel and
pivot adjustments allowing you to
position this monitor in pretty much any
way that you desire and I appreciate the
use of a cable management hole in the
stand that allows you to easily route
the cables into the back panel section
quite a large section of the back panel
can be removed to reveal the ports on
this monitor you get hdmi displayport
2 USB 3.0 ports
in a hub you also get a 3.5 mm audio
jack to drive the speakers in this
monitor which admittedly are
particularly great quality and there's
also the power port which connects to an
external power supply you will need to
use the DisplayPort connector to achieve
240 Hertz on this monitor you can only
get up to 60 Hertz using HDMI and
strangely enough there's actually no
display port cable including the box of
this monitor only an HDMI cable so
you'll need to purchase that necessary
display port cable separately and this
is a definitely well it's disappointing
a mission here from masseuse before I
get into the color quality of this
display it's definitely worth talking
about its key feature which is its 240
Hertz refresh rate with g-sync
I've used a number of high refresh
monitors of my time gaming and I can
definitely tell the difference
immediately from say 60 Hertz to 144
Hertz it is an enormous difference that
drastically improves the smoothness of
your gaming experience as you start
going above 144 hurts though you
definitely experience diminishing
returns I can discern a very minor
difference between 144 and 160 Hertz and
an even smaller difference between 160
Hertz and say 200 Hertz as you start
getting above the 160 hertz mark and go
right up to 240 Hertz on this monitor to
be honest the amount of difference is
negligible if that for most people who
are gaming I think you'll probably be
best suited to 144 or 160 Hertz monitor
I don't think you really get much out of
the 245 6 pews thats provided by the PG
2 582 there are some reasons however to
push the refresh rate all the way up to
240 Hertz if you are a professional
gamer looking at playing eSports titles
particularly those of the fast paced
like csgo you will benefit from the
reduced input latency to this monitor
when running at 240 hertz compared to
something like 144 hertz simply put the
inputs that you make to your keyboard
and mouse will appear on the screen
quicker at 240 Hertz compared to 144
Hertz and this could give you a slight
competitive advantage like I said
earlier I don't expect that most casual
gamers will notice the differ
between 144 and 244 Hertz but for those
that really rely on the fastest action
possible and making those split-second
decisions that extra refresh rate might
have an advantage for you I'm going to
touch briefly on the on-screen display
that's found in the asou speedy - 582 is
the standard method of navigation is
found on most seuss monitors which is
the joystick toggle with the click
button on the back this is how you
navigate through all of their menu
options and there's some additional
buttons on there as well which we'll
touch on in just a moment the blue light
filter comes up to begin with you can
toggle this on if you want to turn down
the coldness of this model it makes it a
bit more pleasant to use in say reading
situations but it does affect the color
accuracy so I'd normally recommend just
to keep that feature off we've got the
color settings here which I'll touch on
more in the color calibration section of
this review we've got the image set tree
we've got things like overdrive which I
found to be at its best on its normal
setting there's very little ghosting to
be found on this panel in general but
the normal thing just has the best
balance between reducing some of that
motion blur we've got the adaptive
contrast control which is something I
definitely recommend you leave disables
are not a huge fan of adaptive contrast
on any monitors we've also got the dark
boost which well it brings up the level
of shadows which might give you an
advantage in some games but again it
affects color performance so I tend to
leave it off the input selector we can
switch between DisplayPort and HDMI here
again you need DisplayPort activated to
use g-sync and the high refresh rate and
then we've got some of these systems
setup options in here nothing too
amazing except for the light in motion
which allows you to turn off the LED
logo that's projected onto your desk
most of these features aren't too
amazing the key features that you will
find or might find useful in the game
plus menu which is accessible through
one of the buttons on the rear here you
can add things like a crosshair a timer
and FPS counter and display alignment
features onto the monitor itself so if
for example you want to see the frames
per second of your game without using a
software utility this monitor will
actually do that for yourself and things
like a crosshair might be important to
you in some competitive
games that don't provide across there
for you in the game itself the final
button of interest on this monitor is
the game visual button activating this
brings up a selection of default color
profiles that you can choose between I
did most of my calibration in the racing
mode simply because you can't actually
change anything in the srgb mode
although for those that can't be
bothered color calibrating the srgb mode
will give you the best color calibration
out of the box moving on to the color
performance of this display and there
are some limitations because it is a TN
panel namely in terms of viewing angles
horizontally it's not too bad but in
terms of the vertical very angles
they're not particularly great you'll
definitely want to view this monitor
from dead-on for the best viewing
experience and of course you'll get
better viewing angles from IPS panel but
there's no 240 Hertz IPS panels that
currently exist
you'll also notice here in our spectra
Cal Cal man software that we use for
calibration that the contrast ratio is
simply 849 to one which is lower than
these thousand to one better suits races
monitor app but it's not too surprising
for a TN monitor taking a look at how
this monitor performs out of the box and
you will see here that the color
temperature is 63 98k which means it's a
bit too warm the ideal value here is 65
0 4 K and also the white levels peak at
400 nits which could give you a quality
of eyestrain and normal viewing
conditions we normally recommend that
you calibrate this to 200 minutes and
that's something that we will do a bit
later moving on to the grayscale
performers and a delta e value of 2.0 to
is actually quite reasonable but not as
color accurate as we would like
so also notice here the average
temperature over all grey colors is 63
52 which means again it's a little bit
too warm the gamma here of 2.09 2 isn't
particularly amazing either you can see
that the grey line isn't quite matching
the yellow line as we would like
particularly thanks to that diff at 90
percent white again this is something
that we can actually color calibrate as
we'll see later
here the saturation sweeps it's quite a
decent performance here we expect most
of the dots to be inside these squares
and you'll see down here the average
Delta II mm value of 2.13 again
indicates that it's reasonably accurate
but not as accurate as would like for
any color significant work here is our
extremely intensive color checker test
that basically tests as many colors as
we could possibly find you'd want all
the values in this chart on the left to
be under a delta e value of two for the
best performance you can see that some
colors are pushing up to Delta e 4 which
isn't particularly accurate I'm looking
in the chart over on the right you'll
also notice that some of these dots
aren't as firmly into the squares as we
would like you can improve this
performance quite significantly simply
by making some minor adjustments in the
on-screen display and anyone that buys
the PG to 5aq can make these adjustments
without having a dedicated color
calibration tool so here what I would
recommend is setting this monitor to its
racing mode changing the brightness to
25 which brings it down to 201 Nets of
brightness keeping the contrast level at
50 and going into the color mode setting
it to the user color calibrated mode and
setting red to 96 Green to 98 and blue
to 99 here we'll go back into cowl man
and take a look at how this changes the
color performance we can see the
temperature is very good 65 29k we've
got our white value of 200 and 1.5 and
our contrast ratio has decreased
slightly but not significantly move on
to our grayscale calibration you can see
it's made a big difference here the
Delta e average previously was over 2
now it's under 1 which indicates
fantastic performance and most of those
values in this Left chart indicate
really solid performance here and the
gamma well we haven't actually fixed
that yet because none of the calibration
tools in the monitor can adjust this and
leaving the monitor on its default gamma
setting of 2.2 is the best performance
you can get without a calibration tool
in the saturation sweeps you'll see
things are a little bit tighter here an
average D value of 1.65 is improved
slightly over before you also see in our
color checker test that again things
have improved slightly to an average
delta e of 2.08 you can achieve really
good color performance on this monitor
if you have a calibration tool though
thanks to Kalman's utilities here we're
heading a temper
of sixty-five o 6k that is pretty much
dead accurate in terms of its white
levels you'll see here a grayscale Delfy
average of 0.9 seven is very solid and
so reduced all of the bars to under a
delta e value of two which is fantastic
here our CCT average of 64 73 is much
better than just using the on screen
display controls to calibrate this
display and again it's basically fix the
Gama to now a value of 2.2 1/3 which is
very very solid in the saturation sweeps
you can see the average delta e value
has reduced to one point zero three
which is a really good result for this
monitor you see that blue performance
still isn't as good as it could be
in the right hand chart some of those
dots aren't quite as into the squares as
we would like but you only really
improve the color performance here by
getting a professional grade monitor in
our color checker test again really
tight performance that's been improved
through calibration a lot of these bars
are now sitting under a delta value of 2
there are some outliers but gem in
general we've got our average delta e
value of 1 point 1 3 9 which is a really
solid result here for the PG 2 5 8 Q
look at the luminance weeps here and
you'll see that the 10% luminance values
aren't particularly amazing but
throughout the rest of the range you
will get reasonably decent performance
out of this monitor and in general once
your color calibrated the PG 2 5 AQ I
think you'll be quite happy with the
color results that you can achieve
overall there's quite a lot to like
about the Asuza rog swift PG 2 5 8 Q
through some minor tweaks in the
on-screen display you can get a
reasonably decent color performance out
of this monitor although you are limited
in some respects by the TN panel but the
main feature of this model is of course
its 240 Hertz refresh rate with g-sync
if you're a professional gamer or just
love playing eSports titles like csgo
you will benefit from the increased
refresh rate over 144 or 160 Hertz to
make those split-second decisions
particularly thanks to reduced input
latency and response times there is a
catch though because this is an
expensive twenty four point five inch
1080p monitor at 599 dollars or 899
Australian dollars if you're not going
to make use of the 240 Hertz refresh
rate provided by this MOA
you can save a
ton of money by simply opting for
something that's 144 Hertz or lower
instead but if you do need that high
refresh rate and you have an Nvidia
graphics card the features provided by
the Isuzu rog swift PG 2 5 AQ are well
suited to your needs and that's it for
this review of the asou speedy - 5 AQ
you can check out a written review on
taxbot comm there's also links to buy
this model in the description below
