have a different sort of video but it's
what I've been wanting to make for a
little while now in fact it's an itch
I've been wanting to scratch ever since
AMD released their Raven Ridge apu
series this is also something many of
you have been asking me to grill AMD
over for the past few months but I'm
going to go about it a bit of a
different way okay so some backstory
here first AMD released their rise in
CPU series on the new AM for platform
back in March 2017 and over the course
of the released over a dozen new cpus
are using the am for socket for this
first generation of horizon cpus we've
got the a320 be 350 and X 370 chipsets
in the very same year being 2017 Intel
released two new mainstream desktop
processor series first we got the
seventh generation Core Series codenamed
KB Lake and with it we got 15 use
standard power desktop parts prices
ranged from $40 us all up to 340 dollars
u.s. then less than nine months later
Intel released their eighth generation
Core Series codenamed coffee Lake and we
now had 14 new standard power desktop
parts this time priced between $40 us
and $360 u.s. why do I bring this up
well because these cpu series despite
using the exact same LGA 1151 socket
aren't in any way compatible although
Intel could have opened up compatibility
they've deliberately blocked it and this
means those wanting to move from say a
core i5 7600 K to the core i7 8700 K
will have to dump their motherboard in
favor of a new 300 series board as it
currently stands Intel's been continuing
compatibility for two generations and
two generations only for example Sandy
Bridge and Ivy Bridge to the 2nd and 3rd
generation Core Series are compatible
then the fourth and fifth generations
codename has well and Broadwell
compatible and the sixth and seventh
generations codenamed skylake and KB
Lake are compatible this issue has been
somewhat lessened by the fact that
Intel's offered little to no improvement
from one generation to the next
so it wasn't until the sixth and seventh
generations came along that those with
second and third generation parts
started to feel like they needed to
upgrade an issue faced when continuing
support by carrying over compatibility
to a new generation is supporting those
new CPUs on previous generation
motherboards for example if you
purchased a 6th generation Core i3 6100
in late 2015 but in early 2017 decides
that you want to upgrade and a seventh
generation Core i5 76 Henrique looks
like what you're after you'd first need
to ensure that your motherboard was up
to date before installing the new CPU
installing a new CPU without the
required bias wouldn't see the system
fail to post otherwise known as power on
self test this is because the
motherboard doesn't recognize the
installed CPU motherboard makers are
generally very fast to add support and
often the required bias is available for
download ahead of the actual CPU release
so it's not really a big deal however if
your board is n170 motherboard which was
designed for the 6th gen core series and
you bought that with a seventh gen
processor it might not work out of the
box and that leaves the consumer in a
bit of a pickle helping to avoid this
scenario Intel has always released a
slew of new chipset so it's unlikely
anyone would purchase a previous
generation motherboard with a new CPU
but it does still happen from time to
time people who run into this issue will
need to take their new hardware to a
local pcs store and hopefully they can
update the board otherwise you would
need to send it back to the retailer and
have them do it for you until does
always go one step further to minimize
this issue by eliminating compatibility
entirely and starting afresh every
second generation this simplifies things
for Intel it makes them considerably
more money in chipset sales and can help
to avoid headaches for consumers that
said the consumer is ultimately worse
off with this approach particularly
enthusiasts who are on a budget most of
you watching this video would have no
doubt appreciated the option to upgrade
your 100 or 200 series Intel motherboard
to support a coffee like CPU rather than
get rid of it and forced to spend over
$100 u.s. on a newsie 370 board okay so
to rewind to the start AMD
released horizon on the am4 platform in
2017 and at the time announced that they
would keep compatibility till at least
2020 that means multiple generations of
processors will be supported on the same
socket not just the refreshes this is a
seriously big deal and while we've now
sent these second-generation Verizon
cpus work perfectly fine on the a320 be
315 X 370 motherboards this should also
be true for these in two processors
slated for release in 2019 although AMD
will continue to release new chipsets
they aren't mandatory and this means
that the be 350 motherboard that you
bought last year for $70 u.s. will be
sticking around for some time to come if
you purchased the MSI be 350 mortar for
example when it was first released it
would have shipped with an early bass
version probably version 1.0 or 1.1 but
if you wanted to use the be 350 mortar
with a Raven Ridge APU you'd need to
make sure it was updated with bass
version 7 a 37 v1b which was released
two weeks ahead of the apu launch if you
bought this motherboard featuring an
earlier bias revision within your apu it
wouldn't have worked since AMD didn't
release a new chipset alongside the AP
use and maintain support for existing
300 series chipsets most purchased to be
350 board and many of them were older
stock shipped before the supporting BIOS
update was developed I am DS copped a
heap of flak over this so much so they
actually had to invest time and money
developing a program that could help
customers update their motherboards by
sending them a cheap a m4 CPU which
could be used to boot the system up and
then update the BIOS in hindsight it
would have been much easier for them to
do what they're done previously with
their ap use and that was to segment the
product lines and offer their APIs on a
different socket with different chipsets
ultimately that approach would have been
less of a headache for AMD far less
convenient for consumers and I for one
am very thankful they didn't take that
approach this issue resurfaced with the
release of the second-generation rise
and CP users people started trying to
pair them with B 315 motherboards that
hadn't been updated and once again
AMD took a heap of flack for something
they're doing that really benefits all
of us it's impossible for AMD to add
right now 4 CPUs they're going to
release in the future and Intel hasn't
developed a time machine to get around
this issue either the only solution is
to act support after a certain period of
time and start afresh
and this is the approach Intel's gone
with we really and I mean really don't
want AMD to take this same approach
there will be a point in time when
upgrading will be necessary to support
new features and memory technologies but
until that time I'd rather not see
compatibility removed just so these
companies can juice more money out of
you I bet there's plenty of h1 10 H 170
and z170 owners that would love to stick
a coffee like CPU on there perfectly
good motherboard my worry though is that
if AMD keeps receiving backlash for
continuing support then I feel like this
is something they might just abandon
after 2020 and instead adopt the sound
compatibility cycle as Intel which sees
a cpu series released then refresh 2
year later on the same platform and then
after that point they drop support
entirely and start over
forcing you to invest in a new
motherboard that might not offer
anything new
beyond CPU support as I've said a lot of
people have been attacking AMD over this
bias update issue and quite a few of you
have been asking me to attack AMD over
this issue but it's not really a
situation that AMD's handled poorly
leading to these problems there is
absolutely nothing or almost nothing AMD
can do to prevent this if we want to see
compatibility remain where new CPUs come
out motherboards need to be updated to
support them this has always been the
case for both AMD and Intel although
there isn't anything aimed you can do
beyond offer their boot kits there are
solutions though but they need to come
from the motherboard makers a seuss has
come up with one such solution which
they call USB bias flashback for this
method all you need is a 24-pin power
cable connected to the motherboard and a
USB stick with the required BIOS simply
stick the USB storage device into the
motherboards USB bios flush back port
then press and hold the USB BIOS
flashback or rog connect button for 3
seconds at this point in LED begins to
blink you
just need to sit back and wait till the
LED stops blinking and that indicates at
the bias has been updated and you're
good to go unfortunately though a soos
only offers this feature on their most
premium boards and none of their be 350
models will support it perhaps this is
something AMD could work on with their
board partners to make a standard rise
and feature I do understand this is a
frustrating issue it's just also unfair
to blame it on AMD those of us who build
their own pcs do choose to take on the
role of the technician and updating
biases is all part of the job if you
don't want to deal with that sort of
stuff then buy a custom-built system
from your local PC store you'll pay more
but at least they come with support
anyway that is gonna do it for this one
oh you guys didn't mind this different
kind of video like I said this is an
issue that's been annoying me because
while I get the frustration the
alternative is far worse I'd much rather
the inconvenience of having to try and
update a motherboards bias opposed to
having to buy a brand new motherboard as
always though I would love to hear your
thoughts on this topic so drop them in
the comment section below thanks for
watching I'm your host Steve and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
