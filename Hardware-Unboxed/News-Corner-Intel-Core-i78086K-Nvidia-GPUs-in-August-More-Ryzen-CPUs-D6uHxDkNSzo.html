the final episode of news corner before
Computex begins next week both Steve and
I are flying out tomorrow night so keep
an eye out for a ton of Computex content
coming in the next couple of days anyway
lots of news topics to get through in
the lead-up to the show starting with a
flurry of rumors surrounding Intel's
40th anniversary edition processor the
guys at video cards uncovered several
retailers lifting an as-yet unannounced
Intel Core i7 8086 K which is set to
mark the 40th anniversary of the famous
8086 on June 8th this new CPU could be
unveiled at Intel's Computex keynote on
June 5th and highly likely we'll see it
launched around the globe on June 8th
with pricing rumored to be around 70 to
100 US dollars more expensive than the
i7 8700 K so that it place it around the
$450 mark as for specs it's not
completely clear what will be getting
though these retail listing is do point
to a 5 gigahertz clock speed out of the
box the 8700 K of course tops out with a
4.7 gigahertz single core turbo clock so
it sounds like the i7 8086 K will push
it up to 5 gigahertz there the base
clock looks to be 4 gigahertz again 300
megahertz higher than 8700 k space 3.7
gigahertz clock it doesn't appear that
the 8086 K will be offering any more
cause than the existing 8700 K in other
words we're still looking at a 6 core 12
thread CPU eight core coffee-like cpus
are planned but that seems to be for a
later date there's also no word on other
features like TDP and cache although as
this appears to be just an up clocks
8700 K I wouldn't expect anything too
far from or the 8700 K already provides
if Intel does want to create an up
clocked version of the 8700 KS an
anniversary edition processor 8700 K
silicon makes a perfect candidate as
it's already quite easy to overclock to
five new Hertz there is a chance that
the 8086 case will be Bend better than
the 8700 case as well so possibly this
new CPU will be better for overclockers
however a rumor does suggest that it
will not be soldered so despite being a
more expensive 8700 K we're still
probably going to be
left with some crappy Tim anyway that's
something to look out for towards the
end of next week now of course with
rumors of new Intel CPUs AMD doesn't
want to be left out of the party so this
week we've also seen a leak uncovering
for news n Plus based second-gen Rison
processes as first spotted by the tech
report this leak comes courtesy of
asrock who published a new cpu
compatibility chart for there a be 350 M
Pro for motherboard detailing the four
previously unheard-of processes now you
probably shouldn't get your hopes up
because none of these CPUs are
particularly exciting at the high end of
the scale we have Verizon v 2600 e and
rise in 720 700 e which as their a
suffix suggests is just a lower TDP
version of the existing twenty six
hundred and twenty seven hundred parts
the 2600 II dropped the base clock from
3.4 to 3.1 gigahertz while the 2700 egos
from three point two two two point eight
gigahertz both in with an unknown boost
clock both CPUs Pat a 45 watt TDP while
the 2600 and 2700 are 65 watt chip so
you can see the reduction their core
configurations look the same as the non
e models as well then we have the risin
5 2500 X and risin 3 2300 X which look
to be the first quad-core CPUs in the
second gen risin line both have 65 watt
TDP s-- the 2300 X gets a 3.5 gigahertz
base while the 2500 X is clocked at 3.6
gigahertz these are very similar core
counts and base clock speeds to the
risin 320 200 G and risin 5 2400 G that
we expect the 2500 X and 2300 X to have
higher boost clocks and sustain better
CPU performance without the integrated
Vega GPU considering Rison ApS are
competitively priced and also up
integrated graphics it will be
interesting to see where AMD prices the
2,300 X and 2500 X though we don't have
any word on pricing just yet keep an eye
out for them soon though we're finally
starting to see some concrete details on
when Nvidia might launch their
next-generation consumer GPUs Nvidia
asset to give a presentation at the hot
chips conference on August 20 titled
invidious next-generation mainstream GPU
which suggests that at the very least in
video we'll be talking new GPUs in
August this seems to fit with other
rumors and what we've been saying for a
little while
it doesn't look like in video we'll be
unveiling new next-generation consumer
graphics cards at Computex next week
instead everything is pointing towards a
July unveiling and launch for Founders
edition cards this would then allow
NVIDIA to discuss their next three P's
openly at hot chips in August around the
same time partners begin reading their
custom designs we've also heard that
notebook variants of these GPUs will be
available in November so that's
something to keep in mind
instead Nvidia will likely spend most of
their Computex press event talking about
other stuff like their self-driving car
technology g-sync xgr max-q laptops and
more that'll no doubt disappoint those
who want just new GPUs but I don't think
we'll have to wait too much longer for
those AMD Vega graphics is finally
coming to gaming laptops this week Acer
announced the very first laptop to
include both a second-generation Rison
processor and Radeon rx Vega graphics
the Acer predator Helios 500 the Helios
500 will be available in both an Intel
and AMD configuration although right now
only the Intel model is listed on Asus
model listing page however the feature
page for the product does detail a
variant that will come with Radeon rx of
a 256 graphics and arisin 7 2700 process
of both of which are typically desktop
parts however AMD did announce Vega
mobile graphics at the start of the year
so it was only a matter of time before a
Vega GPU showed up in a gaming laptop
what's not clear at this point is where
the Vega 56 in this mobile device is a
fully fledged desktop card or whether
it'll be cut down in some way it would
be disappointing if AMD named their
mobile GPU Vega 56 only to include fewer
compute units than the desktop beta 56
so it seems unlikely they'd cut down in
that area
however desktop vega 56 does pack a huge
210 watt TDP which is much higher than
most laptop thermal solutions could cope
with so we will definitely be seeing
some sort of clock speed reduction to
get that down to a more reasonable level
after all the Intel model packs in
nvidia geforce gtx 1070 which is a
mobile TVP well below 150 watts the
other interesting part is of course the
Rison 7 2700 processor we have seen full
desktop rise in CPS in some laptops
before so it seems the Helios 500 will
be another laptop to go down that path
the horizon 7 2700 does have a 65 watt
TDP which is a bit
higher than the claims 45 watts for the
Korra 989 50 HK used in the top and
Intel model but I expect actual power
consumption to be similar for both of
these models other than the CPU and GPU
the Helios 500 includes a 17.3 inch
1080p display with the 144 Hertz refresh
and you get either G sync or free sync
with it depending on whether you go in
video or AMD pricing starts at $2,000
for a model with AI 78758 and gtx 1070
there's no word on how much the Rison at
plus vega model will cost
speaking of Rison in laptops a rumour
popped up this week suggesting AMD is
gearing up to launch h series rise in
mobile cps for higher performance
devices these eight series parts would
feature the same for calls and eight
threads as the existing rise in you
series SKUs but push up to much higher
frequencies thanks to a higher TDP in
other words rise and eight series will
do pretty much exactly what Intel's 8
series already does these new processes
were spotted in the 3d mark database as
tested on an HP 84 EF laptop which is
probably an engineering model the
processes in question are the Rison 720
808 and risin at five 2600 H the 2800 H
has a base clock of 3.4 gigahertz while
the 2600 eighths gets a 3.3 gigahertz
base both have integrated Vega graphics
and it seems the 2600 H has Vega 8 while
we're possibly looking at Vega 10 in the
2800 H there's no word on exactly DP
however base clocks are more than a
gigahertz higher than the you serious
cues so we're probably looking around
that typical 45 watt range in fact it's
quite lucky that AMD will simply take
their Rison 320 200 G and rise in 520
400 G sent them to their lowest
configurable TDP of 45 watts then
repackage them for mobile devices after
all both rise and mobile use series and
Raven Ridge already used the same APU
die with four rise and cause and 11 Vega
compute units these h3 SKUs will just be
pushing the silicon closer to the limits
in a mobile form factor a couple of days
ago Intel announced the availability of
octane dims which brings their 3d xpoint
memory to the ddr4 memory bus until it's
set to brand the sticks as obtained DC
persistent memory which differs from
their obtain DC SSDs and also their
obtain memory
for caching a little bit confusing now
with the naming but anyway obtain DIMMs
will be available in 128 256 and 512
gigabyte capacities and while they will
be shipping to select customers later
this year there won't be wide
availability until 2019 it'll also take
a platform update to support obtain DC
persistent memory because while they are
pin compatible with ddr4 dimm slots
it'll take a few tweaks and also
software changes to support this sort of
storage device through a memory
controller Intel says their next
generation Xeon platform will introduce
obtain dim support and for the time
being this will be an enterprise
technology primarily the key benefit to
obtain DC persistent memory is it
bridges the performance gap between DRAM
and nvm a or PCIe storage by shifting to
the dim form factor which removes the
bandwidth and latency limitations of
PCIe however option dims are persistent
unlike DRAM so they can be used as a
proper storage device with performance
approaching DRAM we're not going to see
ddr4 like performance from the obtain DC
persistent memory to begin with but it
should be a lot faster than current
obtain SSDs but wait there's more AMD
APU news to new 35 watt Raven Ridge ApS
was spotted in the supported processor
list for a Seuss's crosshair 7 hero
motherboard yep another AMD processor
week where the culprit is a list from a
motherboard vendor anyway the to a be
use in question fall under the Athlon
brand we have the Athlon 200 GE and
Athlon pro 200 g both of which are 35
watt skews down from the 65 watts as
with other Raven Ridge parts and both
come with a 3.2 gigahertz base CPU clock
unfortunately we don't know what turbo
clocks were looking at all which GPU
configuration is Athlon ApS will use
however they are set to use Vega
graphics as you expect for Raven rich
the crucial difference between these
apple and ApS and rise and branded Raven
Ridge Parts is the core count other
Raven Ridge ApS are 4 cores and either 4
or 8 threads while the Athlon 200 GE and
Athlon pro 200 GE are 2 core for thread
parts as seuss has launched a new mining
motherboard which is only interesting
because it has 20 PCI Express x1 slots
on it wired as USB 3.0 ports that you
can then convert into actual PCI ports
using riser boards
don't think this is the first time we've
seen this sort of board but it's always
amusing to see him plateau board with
certainly USB ports on it I'm not sure
what the demand we liked one of these
mining boards the Seuss might be a
little add to the party with waning
interest in mining outside of a-sixes
but hey this H through seventy board
will be available soon for the miners
out there Patriot has launched a new
selection of viper RGB ddr4 memory
supporting speeds from ddr4 2666 CL 15
all the way up to ddr4 4133 CL 19 at one
point 4 volts the RGB module integrate
into the heat spreader looks pretty cool
and it's a nice to get a wide range of
speed options with RGB support or Viper
RGB memory supports both Intel and AMD
platforms and you'll also get RGB sync
support with utilities from a soos
asrock gigabyte an MSI the modules are
available now through Amazon with
pricing ranging from $180 for a 16 gig
2666 kit to $280 for the top speed 16
gig 41:33 kit I thought I'd ran out this
news corner with a selection of game
news from the past week or so just in
case you missed it with III coming up in
the next few weeks there's been a fair
few teasers for games just today we've
got a very short teaser for the next
Assassin's Creed game from Ubisoft
titled Assassin's Creed Odyssey which
appears to be set in ancient Greece then
a few days ago we had the teaser trailer
for Fallout 76 which is reportedly a
survival multiplayer game I'm short
peasant wondered another single-player
RPG we'll be a bit disappointed with
that revelation though again we can
expect more news at 83 then we also had
pub G Corp suing Epic Games over for
tonight's battle royale mode because of
course that's going to go down well
apparently fought not infringed on pub
G's copyright and plagiarized the game
mode now that fortnight is a bit more
popular than pub G I reckon it's a bit
salty from the pub G guys but it'll be
interesting to see how that court case
goes anyway that's it for this week's
news corner we'll hopefully be back next
week with the news corner episode from
Computex so stay tuned for that aside
from that subscribe to make sure you
don't miss these episodes that typically
go out every Friday and I'll catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
