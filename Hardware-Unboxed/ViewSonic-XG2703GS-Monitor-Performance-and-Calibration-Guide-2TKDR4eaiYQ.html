unbox more monitor content coming
straight at you today where we'll be
looking at one of you Sonic's top-end
gaming monitors the imaginatively named
xg2 7:03 - GS to discuss how performs
and to give you guys a few easy tips on
how to improve its color accuracy
through the on-screen display controls
the XG 2 7:03 - GS which i'm going to
have to call the beast for the rest of
this video thanks to its ridiculous
product name packs a ton of great
features it's a 27-inch 2560 by 1440 LCD
panel you can want viewsonic calls IPS
type technology digging a little deeper
reveals this panel is actually using a
you Optronics a hv a technology which
despite its name doesn't refer to
vertical alignment tech like other VA
displays instead a hv a stands for
advanced hyper viewing angle a
technology that has its foundations in
IPS so i guess it pretty much is an IPS
panel just really confusing panel
technology named Owen it is a true 8 bit
panel none of this 6 bit + dithering
crap when you're looking at four panels
you always want to make sure it's 8 bit
and the beast here definitely provides
that so the beast 1440p resolution is
complemented by a native 144 hertz
refresh rate with the ability to
overclock up to 165 Hertz using the
on-screen display this process is pretty
easy and while the monitor does warn you
about overheating and a bunch of other
stuff while overclocked I didn't
actually experience any of these issues
while using the monitor at 165 Hertz if
you do end up buying one I don't see any
reason why you shouldn't just run it at
165 Hertz all the time especially if
you're paying more than a typical 1440p
144 Hertz monitor for this additional
refresh rate of course it wouldn't be a
top-end monitor with that adaptive sync
technology in this case G sync for those
with Nvidia graphics cards although
there is a precinct model available
it also supports ultra-low motion blur
which strobes the backlight to eliminate
motion blur though you cannot use both G
sync and ultra-low motion blur at the
same time most gamers
to stick with just g-sync though if
you're playing a fast-paced competitive
game you may benefit from enabling you
OMB if you're pushing at least 120
frames per second the beast uses a
flicker free backlight capable of a
maximum brightness of 315 it's according
to viewsonic I'm also seeing a 1,000 to
1 rated contrast ratio that ignores the
ridiculous 120 million to 1 dynamic
ratio you should probably just disable
dynamic contrast ratio straight out of
the box for the best results so 1000 to
1 rated contrast ratio 4 milliseconds
greater great response times 178 degree
viewing angles in both directions 3
angles on this model are actually
unbelievably good probably due to that
hyper viewing angle tech with
essentially no color shift at off angles
and only a small brightness reduction
and just on response times 4
milliseconds is fine for this sort of
Mara I found the advanced response time
setting produced the best blur reduction
with that inverse ghosting which is
something that you will get if used the
ultra fast setting of course with also a
motion blur you can present even further
but again you know you kind of can't use
that with g-sync which is a bit
disappointing as a quick note on refresh
rate I use a 100 Hertz a Supriya that
x34 for most of my gaming so I can
notice an improvement to smoothness and
responsiveness when jumping up to 144
Hertz but the jump to 165 Hertz on this
monitor is certainly a lot harder to
notice coming from 144 Hertz unless you
have a super powerful gaming desktop or
enjoy low detailed gaming you won't be
hitting above 144 FPS at 1440p ultra
detail settings all that often still I
guess the extra refresh rate is nice to
have as PC hardware improves over the
coming years because you probably won't
be upgrading your monitor or that often
or at least if you spend this kind of
money you definitely won't be wanting to
upgrade particularly often let's talk
about how the viewsonic beast performs
in terms of color accuracy before I jump
into some of our color and fire results
here's a very accentuated photo I took
of the beast displaying a black screen
in a dark room here you can see some
noticeable backlight bleed particularly
in the bottom left and top right corners
now this photo isn't really
representative of how the monitor
actually looks in a dark room but the
backlight bleed is certainly no
anyway it's very slightly noticeable
under the artificial lights of my office
as well which is a minor concern but
nothing too bad here anyway on to the
color results and here we're looking at
how the monitor performance directly out
of the box we're seeing it set to its
maximum brightness by default which
produces 358 nits of brightness and a
contrast ratio of 1043 to one pretty
close to view Sonic's original
specifications default grayscale
performance isn't great particularly due
to a weak Gama result of just two point
zero three and an average Delta II mm
value of three point two seven you can
see from the color temperature graph
that Reds are under represented here by
default as well
saturation performance is okay again
with the under saturated Reds but better
saturation for greens and blues overall
adultery mm value of two point three
nines a bit sort of what I'd like to see
here but not awful for a default
calibration and in our color checker
test we can see here in average Delta mm
value of just under three point zero
which is okay again but not ideal for
color accurate work interestingly color
gamut clocks in at 110 percent of srgb
by default while luminance sweeps are
reasonably tight if you want to
calibrate this monitor but you don't
have a dedicated calibration tool here
are the steps I take to improve
performance at least on my review unit
switch the gamma from two point two to
two point for this setting actually
produces a gamma of two point two so
it's a bit confusing the name in there
but I guess they might have stuffed up
some of their calibration profiles on
this Maura
you should also switch the color
temperature mode to use the color and
switch the G gain to 95 and the be gain
to 96 while leaving the our gain
untouched and finally if you want to set
to around 200 Nets set the brightness to
47 which I think provides the best
experience indoors with the monitor set
to these settings contrast ratio is
reduced to just nine hundred fifty nine
to one although average color
temperature is much improved now an
extremely solid
65 85 k and the grayscale TT mm value is
an excellent zero point eight three
gamma at nearly 2.2 has also been
corrected so very decent results across
our grayscale test here saturation has
been significantly improved from an
which dealt 83,000 value of 2.39 down to
one point two three which is just shy of
the one point zero value considered very
accurate color checker results also move
from an averaged LT from around three
point zero to one point six one again a
very solid improvement the adjustments
also pulled back the srgb gama to
99.999% no joke i actually tested this
monitor a couple of times in yep 99.999
1% of the srgb gama so super accurate
there now is also a great time to
discuss pound uniformity matching what
we discovered earlier with backlight
bleed the panel here is an entirely
uniform with a bottom left and top right
areas deviating the most from the center
level when calibrating the beast using
my eye one displayed pro I hit a
grayscale average Delta II 2000 value of
the 0.43 which is an excellent result as
well as a flat temperature curve with an
average of 65 24k so pretty much dead
accurate and suitable for cut accurate
work saturation Delta mm a virgin proved
to 1.01 pretty much accurate really
impressed with the results here while
the colorchecker result also improves to
adults where mm value of one point two
zero pretty safe to say that with proper
calibration the Beast can be a great
monitor for Chi accurate work while also
providing the benefits of 1440p GC and
165 Hertz refresh rates for gamers it's
a pretty versatile modeler and you can
even get decent color results just by
tweaking a few things in the on-screen
display the viewsonic XG 2 7:03 - GS is
a pretty expensive monitor so you wanted
to pack great color performance and
features you can purchase one through
Amazon for around seven hundred US
dollars or nine hundred dollars in
Australia I think that's a pretty fair
price although of course on the
expensive side but you do get features
like 1440p resolution at 27 inches 165
Hertz
refresh rates hard to pass up stuff like
that with GC can also you know great
color performance is always nice to have
we'll have some more monitor stuff
coming soon so check back on hardware
and box in the coming weeks but for now
I'll catch you guys next time
