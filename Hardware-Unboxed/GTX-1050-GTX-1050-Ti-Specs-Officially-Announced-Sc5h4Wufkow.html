weird hang on I'll be back in a minute
okay so that's a bit of an improvement
anyway okay so down to business at this
point you're probably wondering where
Matt is the good news is he's still live
and well the bad news is he can't be
here for today's video
matters a bit going on at the moment
he's booked in for knee surgery next
week I believe it is
he's Danny's ACL anyway he's gonna
explain a bit more about what's going on
there and the plans for the channel and
how he's gonna get by over the next
weeks months with you know recovering
from knee surgery that'll be in he's
unboxing boxes series on Monday where
we'll explain a bit more detail about
what's going on and whatnot but for now
I'm happy to help out with content on
the channel and hopefully you guys don't
mind the change of pace and having me
keep your company okay for some weeks
now we've been hearing rumors of
Nvidia's upcoming budget graphics card
series dubbed the geforce gtx 1050
yesterday nvidia finally gave us
official details and we're now able to
pass them on to you guys so let's get
into it
padding out the paschal lineup is not
one but rather to affordable GPUs along
with the vanilla GTX 1050 there is also
going to be a slightly buffed TI model
using the full GP 107 GPU Nvidia says
they're positioning these new budget
parts as perfect solutions to transform
basic pcs without discrete graphics
cards into something that can play all
the latest PC games at respectable
settings as both graphics cards don't
require an external power connector
upgrading an old PC is easy and won't
require a new power supply in most cases
Nvidia is boasting a three times
performance improvement with the GTX
1050 when compared to the aging GTX 650
with the gtx 750ti falling somewhere in
between the two for this reason Nvidia
is claiming the GTX 1050 is all you need
to play your favorite games at frame
rates above 60fps including GTA 5 and
Gears of War 4 albeit at modest
resolutions and qualities
if you've been following the leaks the
specifications weren't surprised as
nothing has changed here both cards are
based on in videos GP 107 GPU and
features 75 watt TDP s the GTX 1050 is
640 criticals
while the 1050 TI bumps up to 768
criticals
the base model 1050 will operate it up
to fourteen hundred and fifty five
megahertz while the toi model will be
slightly slower at 13 hundred and ninety
two megahertz NVIDIA has already stated
through overclocking both GPUs will run
happily at up to one point nine
gigahertz though they do also expect
some users could push even higher so
it'll be interesting to see where this
lands up in terms of performance both
around with gddr5 memory operating at
seven gigabits per second the TI version
will come exclusively with a 4 gigabyte
buffer while the standard 1050 will be
available in either 2 gigabyte or 4
gigabyte configurations both use a
piddly little 128-bit wide memory bus
though in veer does stress that with
their Pascal memory compression
technology this won't be an issue both
models will become available on October
25th from a wide variety of board
partners those wondering though in video
will not be releasing a founders edition
variant of either card the ti version is
priced in a modest 139 us while the
standard 1050 is just 109 us placing
both in strong competition with AMD zone
raid on rx for 62 year and 4 gig models
right so at this stage neither Matt or
myself have a cards and we're hoping to
get them in time that's that's the plan
anyway regardless you can expect GD x
1050 vs rx 460 to gig and GD x 1050 TI
vs RX for 64 gig head-to-head
comparisons on the channel in the near
future hopefully if not next week the
week after but we'll see how we go well
that's all for me on this one guys how
do you think the budget GPU wars gonna
play out be sure to let us know in the
comments below thanks for checking out
the specifications these new GPUs with
us and hopefully next week we can have
some in-depth testing for you so stay
tuned for that see you guys so those of
you that already support the channel
thank you so much it's truly appreciated
and to those of you that would like to
support the channel directly I do have
