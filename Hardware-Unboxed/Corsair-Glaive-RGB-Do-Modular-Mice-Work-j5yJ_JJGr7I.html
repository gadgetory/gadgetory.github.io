unbox I think it's time that we do
another peripheral review on the channel
this time we're taking a look at the
Corsair glaive so this is course is
brand new RGB Gaming Mouse it's in the
upper mid tier of Gary Mouse pricing art
it will set you back around 70 US
dollars or if you're in Australia I
think it's a hundred and thirty dollar
you do so pretty expensive as far as a
mouse goes but the glaive does include a
very compelling feature sets got pretty
much everything you want as far as a
mouse is concerned and that makes it a
pretty compelling option if you're
looking for a new sort of top-tier
gaming mouse for the speck scenes out
there the glaive comes with a 16,000 dpi
sensor it's pretty much the top tier of
gaming mouse sensors at the moment
however I'm not too sure if you'd
actually want to use their massive
16,000 dpi but certainly an option
available if you need it
it comes with amnon switches rated for
50 million key presses we're seeing a
1,000 Hertz polling rate a nice 1 point
8 meter braided cable 122 gram weight
and it comes with 6 programmable buttons
so decent feature set here I really love
the design of the glaive it's a mostly
plastic Mouse with bits of aluminium if
you choose to buy the aluminium model I
was sent the black mold to review so
it's pretty much entirely plastic the
palmers has a lovely soft touch plastic
finish which I think feels great in your
hands on the right side there's a
rubberized textured area that adds grip
for your pinky and ring fingers and on
the other side is the glazed unique
feature
it's swappable foam grips of course it
includes three grips in the box the
default one uses the same soft touch
plastic finish as the palm rest this is
my personal favorite it keeps the mouse
nice and slim but it still feels great
to hold and use coarse they also
includes a wider grip which is perfect
for people with larger hands it uses the
same texture rather finish as on the
right hand side of a mouse to give you a
bit of extra grip and the third grip
that's included has a wide thumb rest
pedal I know some people like that sort
of mouth design and it's great that
corset allows you to switch through
either of these three options out of the
box without having to sort of make that
decision before you purchase them out
you can simply buy the glaive
and see what sort of grip is right for
you after your purchase
I think the globe is a really
comfortable mouth to use it's high-ish
arches perfect for people who have to
palm grip their mouth and the subtle
curve to the right side is great for
people who use the mouth in their right
hand I use this mask for a ton of gaming
and also just general system use and
yeah I think it's really comfortable as
I said before no complaints here the
buttons include on the mountain route
you're obviously your left and right
click very cliquey response here thanks
those on once which is no complaints
here on the left side you get their
forward and back buttons a little bit
mushy for my liking here but it's in the
perfect position I mean the perfect
position if you are a palm gripping user
I simply one movement and you're
pressing forward or back and no problems
here you also get the pretty solid
middle click requires slightly too much
for my liking is probably nitpicking a
little bit but the scrolling action
itself is really solid love the way the
smell scrolls and the final button on
the mouse is a dpi selection it's in a
pretty awkward position so you won't be
using that button too often but you know
you can select through five dpi presets
in the Corsair software utility and of
course you can remap all of the buttons
on this mouse except left click image
utility to macros other features or
whatever you'd like so if you'd rather
remap that middle button to something
that isn't the DPI switch you can very
easily do that in courses software
utility courses software utility is also
used for the RGB functionality in this
mouse now I don't think RGB on a mouse
is as useful as it is on a keyboard and
with the Corsair glaive it's pretty easy
to block some of the RGB zones when
you're actually using the mouse however
you do get three zones on this mouse
that are individually customizable to
whatever color you'd like alternatively
you can do things like make the mouse
breathe through a rainbow of colors if
you so choose the main zone is the
Corsair logo that's included on the palm
rest you also get a zone that includes
either side of the mouse with those
strips of lighting and the third and
final zone is the front zone sort of
projects a little bit of white onto your
trackpad again three thirds of customers
really is pretty decent for a mouse I
think you'll be buying the glaive for
some of its comfort its build quality
and removable grip features rather than
those RGB zones that's more of just sort
of a nice
addition to the package in terms of its
tracking experience I normally use a
mouse in the 2,000 to 3,000 dpi range
and the Corsair glaive performs really
well in that regard again no one is
going to be using this for 16,000 dpi
it's way too jittery there's also a
sniper mode included some people want to
push it down to sort of your 400 dpi
mode works really well tracks really
well across the board and it even comes
with a surface calibration utility in
the Corsair software engine so you can
calibrate it to the trackpad or the
surface that you're using to get that
slight edge in terms of your tracking
experience but really your most mouse is
your spending you know seventy dollars
for you're getting a really good
tracking experience and the glaive is no
exception here for those of you that
want to buy a premium gaming mouse and
have around 70 US dollars to spend the
corsair glaive is one of the best
options on the market in my opinion it's
really comfortable to use has a great
feature set whether or not I personally
would spend $70 on a mouse not too sure
I think that's been expensive for just a
mouse but I totally understand there's
people out there who want to spend that
sort of money to get a really top-notch
feature set and Corsa has certainly
provided that with their new glaive RGB
mouse anyway that's it for this review
