welcome back to hardware unbox have got
another monitor video for you guys today
this one is a bit of an unusual story
actually biotech wanted to send out
their brand new ultra cheap office
monitor for review and some look at the
factory got confused and sent out their
24 inch 144 Hertz curved gaming monitor
instead bit of a surprise when the wrong
display arrived at my doorstep
a few weeks ago but I figured why not
gonna make some content so I'll review
this thing anyway so the monitor biotech
mistakenly sent me is the GN 24 C a 24
inch 1080p VA monitor with an 1800 R
curve and a maximum 144 Hertz refresh
rate with free sync of course the geode
24 C is currently going for 220 dollars
so that's a little bit more expensive
than the 24 inch 1080p TN panels at 144
Hertz those retail for around 190 to 200
dollars but considering we're looking at
a VA panel instead that's a small bump
in price and it could be worth it if
there's an improvement to performance
personally I'm not a huge fan of curve
16:9 displays as I don't think the curve
improves the viewing experience
whatsoever at 24 inches the monitor it's
simply too small for it to have any
impact curved displays are a bit of a
personal preference thing though so I'm
not gonna mark down Vitek for choosing a
curved panel I really like to design
this model a it's probably my favorite
monitor design of the past dozen
monitors I've reviewed and that's for
one reason it's simple despite being
marketed as a gaming monitor the GN 24
seat doesn't feature any crazy RGB LEDs
or read gamer patterns it's just a basic
functional design that looks great
in particular is a single piece of
curved matte plastic which in
conjunction with the three pronged metal
standard is a fantastic minimalist
aesthetic it's reasonably thin for a
curved model as well I honestly wish
more gaming monitors looked like this
rather than the usual stuff you get with
Sade and a soos rog display while the
design looks great it's still pretty
basic from a functionality perspective
this Dan only supports tilt adjustment
so you don't get height adjust which I
find to be the most critical
adjustability feature like a lot of
fixed height monitors the June 24 C sits
pretty low on your desk I suspect a lot
of people have to raise it up a bit for
comfortable usage the OSD control is
also very basic with four buttons along
the bottom edge I really wish WyoTech
adduced a directional toggle here but
it's not quite as bad as other monitors
that opt for a basic face button simply
because the OSD doesn't include a ton of
features aside from a quite limited
array of color controls overdrive and
free sync settings and a cheat crosshair
feature there's nothing else to see here
really four inputs you get two HDMI
ports and DisplayPort that's it there
are built-in speakers but the only way
to use them is via HDMI or DisplayPort
audio and the quality of the speaker's
isn't great so perhaps forget I ever
mentioned them one last thing to talk
about before looking at performance and
that's the bezel size biotechs website
definitely exagerate s-- the slimness of
the bezels the product photos show the
image extending all the way to the outer
plastic edge but in reality the panel
begins about five millimeters in from
that edge bezels of just eight point
five millimeters or so are still quite
slim but don't be fooled by the product
shots on biotechs website so the panel
we're looking at is a 24 inch 1920 by
1080 VA LCD with a maximum refresh rate
of 144 Hertz
it supports free synchroflow frame rate
compensation and it has an 1800 hour
curvature compared to the TN panels used
in Cheaper 24 inch 1080p 144 it's
displays this VA panel does bring
significantly improve viewing angles
though slightly reduced due to the curve
and of course a much higher contrast
ratio with superior blacks typically VI
panels feature slower response times
compared to TN so we'll look at that
later and the cheaped here in displays
are flat rather than curved if that
makes a difference for you
thing checks out in terms of brightness
and contrast ratio biotech claims a 215
it peak brightness and I measured around
278 notes out of the box and that's a
suitable brightness level for indoor
usage contrast ratio hovers around 3200
to one beating via text claims and that
ratio is held well throughout a range of
brightnesses competing TN panels are
more around the nine hundred to one mark
so this is one area you are going to get
a massive improvement to performance and
that's all down to V as much lower black
levels unfortunately the GN 24 C does
suffer from poor display uniformity the
flat TN panels I've tested around this
price aren't amazing either but when you
add a curve it tends to be harder to
keep the backlight uniform the edges of
the June 24 C are particularly
inaccurate compared to the center more
so than other curve displays I've looked
at and there's a noticeable glow near
the edges when viewing darker content
out of the box color performance is also
poor the GA 24 C gets its white balance
approximately correct but the rest of
the grayscale range isn't great and you
can see that in the CCT average chart
and also in the Delta II chart the
average grayscale delta a comes out at
3.97 but those mid Gray's are clearly
well above that gamma of just one point
out is bizarrely low as well most
monitors get that much closer to 2.2 at
the factory this lackluster performance
continues looking at saturation sweeps
where the G and 24 C produces a delta a
of just four point three four and that's
even higher in Co checker at five point
five with a maximum Delta a of nine
point nine two to me these results
indicate that no factory calibration has
been done whatsoever and biotech a
basically just taking the panels as is
without considering accuracy and to be
fair to them that is expected of a
budget monitor though this one is
particularly inaccurate out of the box
at least we are getting near full srgb
coverage normally this is the part of
the review where I talk about addressing
these performance issues through the
settings provided in the on screen
display because normally you can get
some quick and easy fixes through
twiddling a few settings and that allows
you guys to get the most out of your
display with that a calibration tool but
in this case the case of the jehan 24 C
the OSD only provides a few basic
controls and from my testing I concluded
that changing any of them actually makes
the performance worse compared to the
default mode the main setting you have
act
- is a standard user color control with
sliders for red green and blue but
bizarrely tightening up say 100% white
and a dark gray value causes mid Gray's
to get less accurate while tightening up
mid Gray's blows out a hundred percent
white part of this is like me down to
the lack of a proper gamma setting
you're still going to be stuck at gamma
1.8 so my advice unfortunately is to
leave the display on its default setting
and leave any calibration down to a
software profile the good news is the
display is actually quite easy to
calibrate so it would have definitely
been nice to get more control on the OSD
to make proper changes after a quick
run-through using spectral Cal's Cal Man
5 the GN 24c ended up with a proper
gamma curve around 2.2 a good CCT
average and good Delta ease across both
our grayscale saturation and color
checker tests even the maximum de in
color checker was respectable just 2.27
which is a better result than I achieved
with the equivalent TN panel it's also
great to see the calibration had only a
minor effect on contrast ratio dropping
from 31 to 60 3 to 1 to just 30 88 to 1
one of the major issues with calibrating
TN panels is a loss in contrast the kg
to 5 1qf with its 24 inch 144 Hertz TN
drops to just 728 to 1 which is
significantly lower than what the GN 24c
provides when calibrating so when you do
get the TN and VA panels providing
similar color accuracy the VA option is
providing a much better image due to
superior contrast and better viewing
angles and as always our patreon members
can download the calibrated display
profile I created for this monitor over
on our patreon page links to that in the
description below for this monitor in
particular I think it is worth grabbing
that profile to improve performance
significantly as for response times this
V air monitor actually performs quite
well with an average greater gray
response time of 5.2 2 milliseconds all
but one transition I measured the full
black to white transition took less than
the refresh rate window of 6.9 4
milliseconds so this display is
definitely capable of displaying a true
144 Hertz the black white black
transition time of 13.8 eight
milliseconds is decent for a VA panel as
well biotech do claim a 3 millisecond
transition time for this display so the
actual results are a few milliseconds
off
again this isn't bad for a VA panel few
things to mention though as you'll see
in the chart competing at 1080p 144
Hertz tan panels are around twice as
fast so you'll experience less ghosting
and smearing with the tea and offering
that's it transition times around 5
milliseconds don't usually result in a
lot of ghosting anyway and with the
superior color performance of this video
I think overall you're going to get a
better experience I also tested with
overdrive disabled there are three
overdrive modes but all introduced
overshoot sometimes significant
overshoot which causes issues like
reverse ghosting which i think is
unacceptable even with overdrive
disabled one transition did show a
slight overshoot of around 10% is 0 to
50% great transitions so it seems vaio
takes default drive through this panel
is pushing it pretty close to the limits
as its it's also worth looking at input
lag and this monitor is undoubtedly very
fast in terms of processing at just a
few milliseconds the kg 2 5 1 qf which
again is one of those $200 or so 1080p
144 Hertz TN displays exhibited
significantly more input lag so even
though the k g2 v 1q F's TN panel is
twice as fast
the GN 24c is actually faster overall
when input lag is factored in so that's
a great result for gamers wanting to buy
the GN 24 see there is one downside
though and that's power consumption the
GN 24 seed uses a huge 49.8 watts when
calibrated which is significantly higher
than the 17.4 one so measure to the kg 2
v 1 qf but at an average power price of
13 cents per kilowatt-hour in the united
states it'll cost you just 19 dollars a
year to run the June 24 C for eight
hours a day compared to seven dollars
for the K t25 1qf and I'll leave it up
to you to decide whether that price
difference matters I'm a bit torn on
whether to recommend the vo-tech GN 24 C
or not I really like the design and most
importantly I do think the VA panel
offers better color quality and
performance than competing TN panels
that are available for around $20 less
so while the GN 24 C is $220 compared to
$200 for 10 competitors the way better
contrast ratio viewing angles and
overall input lag is worth the 10% price
increase in my opinion but you really
need to care
retina monitor to get acceptable
performance the out-of-the-box
calibration is poor and this little you
can do to address the problem in the OSD
so you either calibrate yourself which
isn't cheap if you don't already have
the required software or you download a
software profile like we provide for our
patrons but that only gets you so far
and due to variance in panels and
software compatibility issues it doesn't
guarantee great performance in every
application
I really wish fire tech had tightened up
calibration at the factory or at least
included a wider set of controls to fix
accuracy using the OSD because then the
June 24 C would be an easy
recommendation it's better than the 10
offerings for a small increase in price
but as it stands whether this monitor is
right for you will come down to whether
you are willing to calibrate it or
really how much you care about color
performance that's it for this review of
the vo-tech G + 24 C there's links to
check out this monitor and a range of
others we recommend in the description
