around at premium headsets then you're
probably feeling pretty overwhelmed
there's certainly enticing options out
there these days with more and more
companies entering the gaming headset
fold today I'm going to be taking a look
in an entry from US company polka audio
called the Stryker Pro p1 now before you
tear me down in the comments yes I do in
fact have on hand the Pope Stryker pros
that X but as this is a PC gaming
channel and the headsets are identical
apart from color and the addition of the
Xbox one controller accessory I'm going
to be reviewing the headset from the PC
gamers perspective now the package Bose
audio file great sound for gamers so
we'll be looking forward to checking out
the sound a bit later but for now let's
take a look at the aesthetics and design
the Stryker Pro is certainly supposed to
be a premium headset and the first
glance it comes across that way
it's constructed from a combination of
smooth brushed steel and high-grade
plastics the headband is wrapped in a
very soft to touch leather the overall
color scheme is mostly charcoal with
Xbox and more green features setting off
the Z next edition of the headset while
the p1 for PC is dressed with red the
medium to large-sized the ear cups did
fit around my ears just and they're also
wrapped in a plush leather that feels
really nice on the head these can be
adjusted vertically of course and swivel
the full 90 degrees so they can be
stored flat I've recorded this section
to give you guys an idea of the mic
recording quality the included
microphone is very flexible and features
a built-in mute button which is very
handy the other feature I love about the
mic is the fact that it's removable it's
becoming more common but I wish all
headsets did this this isn't a
particularly light headset but it is
rather comfortable I found the group
around my head to be ideal and it was
certainly good for long gaming sessions
the striker comes with a variety of
wired connectivity options including a
mobile connect cable with an inline
remote and microphone a dual Jack
console controller cable and a dual jack
extra long three meter PC connect cable
all of which are of course completely
removable now let's check out the sound
quality I guess the first thing to note
here
this is a stereo headset not 7.1
surround with that out of the way I
tested this headset pretty extensively
in csgo NBA 2k16 Starcraft 2 you add a
bit of Skyrim and found them really
great to use the first thing I noticed
using this headset in old games was that
it provided a really nice open full
sound it doesn't feel like the speaker
is immediately next to your ear when you
hear sounds that should be far away for
music the striker Pro is sound really
nice too which is a real bonus for a
gaming headset the low end sounds are
tight and that's within games the
overall sound is nice and open and full
this is great to see and really adds to
the diversity of use for the headset now
it's both gaming and music tied up you
can safely bet on movies being a great
experience too and they were as long as
you aren't picky about having surround
sound overall the polk audio striker
pro's that x or p1 headset is a great
solution for those that want an
adaptable headset for a variety of uses
unfortunately it won't suit those who
are after 7.1 surround sound and it is a
little on the weightier side but its
multitude of specialized cables mean you
can use it to PC gaming music console
gaming movies and your smartphone the
overall aesthetics and detachable mark
also mean you can use this down the
street or in a cafe or without looking
odd if that's something you care about
I for one leave my mic on with pride but
each to their own
there are comfortable headset with tight
powerful bass that's suited for PC
gaming especially but sounds great for
other uses too
the p1 model can be had for 120 us on
Amazon and the ZX model with the
additional Xbox one controller adapter
it's currently available for the same
price thanks for checking out a Stryker
pros with me I'd love to hear what you
think of them in the comments and on our
forum a hard round box comm don't forget

out and I'll see you guys next time yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
