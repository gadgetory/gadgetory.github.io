come on a final episode before Computex
kicks off in a few days Steve and I are
flying over there shortly it's actually
not too bad of a trip for us Aziz for
once considering it's not too far away
from here but it certainly is a bit more
punishing for those in other areas
anyway enough about that let's get into
some pre Computex news and rumor
discussion the first story just popped
up when I was riding today's show notes
in video a teasing some sort of super
product in a video that was published to
their g4 social media channels the 16
second long teaser is titled something
super is coming and then proceeds to fly
over a metallic object with the word
super cut out as expected not much to go
on here but you'd think this would be a
teaser for invidious Computex event
which is said to happen in just a few
days on May 27th we really don't know
what to expect here but given its poster
to the g-force channels did have to be
related to consumer gaming focused
products it could be a new Titan GPU but
they already have the Titan RT X and
technically Titan isn't g4 so there is a
bit of crossover there and of course it
could be something that's not a GPU
Nvidia does like to talk extensively
about their other products at these
sorts of events like their car
technology game streaming services
shield chase ink and so on probably can
rule out car tech but at least this
teaser has added a bit of spice to an
event that otherwise wasn't looking
super exciting or aligning too well with
invidious no general release strategies
of course the other big stories in the
lead-up to Computex around AMD in fact
there have been a ton of rumors leaked
stories you name it surrounding AMD and
their various hotly anticipated product
lines like ricin and Nafees let us talk
a little bit about that one set of leaks
that is obviously going to happen is for
new x5 70 motherboards we've known for
ages now that motherboard partners are
launching x5 70 products at the show
it's set to be one of the major things
that Computex and we're starting to see
a variety of leaks slip out not even
sure if you can call this story a leak
though because MSI were showing off
their upcoming x5 70 boards on an
insider live stream so it doesn't get
more confirmed than that the interesting
thing here is the active cooling
the chipset it appears not just on the
board they were showing off on the
livestream but also on another board are
spotted by video cards we'll see in the
coming days where the other vendors have
used active cooling on these products as
well the other X 570 related leak is
plausible but remains unclear whether
it's accurate at this stage it's
basically a diagram showing everything X
570 can do in conjunction with Rison
3000 series CPUs so we can see the CPU
has native USB 3.1 gen2 1 and M got 2
capabilities plus PCIe
4.0 lanes while the x5 70 chipset
handles additional PCIe 4.0 slots USB
3.1 gen2 Wi-Fi solder all the usual
stuff allegedly the TDP of the x5 70 PCH
has increased to 15 Watts up from 5
watts with x4 70 hence the need for
active cooling again sounds plausible
and the diagram looks plausible as well
but we don't have any confirmation on it
at this stage then the other set of
rumors surrounds AMD Navi 1 comes from a
deleted Komachi tweet suggesting Navi
has a different streaming engine
structure purely unconfirmed story at
this stage and a doubt will hear any
in-depth details on Nafees architecture
at Amy's Computex event to confirm and
salute strains of that tweet was deleted
then we also got a story that seemed to
ruffle a few feathers where Chinese PR
rep for sapphire allegedly revealed that
Navi will come in the form of at least
two SKUs and RTX 2060 competitor at four
hundred US dollars and a 90 X 27 t
competitor at 500 us the rep also
suggested no hardware level ray-tracing
obviously lots of people immediately
became concerned about the value
proposition of these cards versus in
video but this is basically an
unconfirmed story at this stage we don't
know if it's true and we suggest you
treat the rumor the same again AMD has
two big events coming up at Computex and
then at e3 where we are expecting to
learn more details about Navi and if AMD
doesn't announce much about Navi next
week it's highly likely there will be
information on the show floor about aim
Lee's next-gen GPU plans because the
launch is supposedly not too far away
another rumor / leak hit the news this
week although this time it's about Intel
not AMD so that's a bit refreshing a
leaked roadmap from Huawei of all
companies detailing their server
products over the next few years has
also revealed some details about Intel's
upcoming server chips
actually while a wants their servers to
align with Intel's plans hence the info
on the slide the big story here that
will interest you guys is the news of
PCIe 5 and ddr5 being supported in
Intel's 2020 one server platform
codenamed sapphire Rapids this is
essentially two architectures away we're
on cascade Lake right now we're set to
get Cooper Lake and ice Lake in 2020
after which were then looking at
sapphire Rapids and then granite Rapids
according to the roadmap this is setting
up sapphire Rapids as a massive platform
upgrade for Intel to get a channel ddr5
also add PCIe 5 and we're only just
getting chips supporting PS a 4.0 now
that will be a huge improvement and it's
said that this platform will coincide
with the launch of Intel's next-gen a
seven nanometer process node so combine
all those things together and it's
looking promising if this leak ends up
accurate and of course Intel server
platforms tend to dictate what happens
on the desktop so you'd expect big Io
against for desktop chips a few
generations into the future as well
normally I don't bother covering Apple
stories but I did find this one a bit
amusing Apple have refreshed their
MacBook Pros and inside the company is
unsurprisingly using Intel's latest
ninth gen CPUs but rather than sticking
to the regular six core Core i7 models
Apple is offering all the way up to an
eight core core I 998 agh and Cory $9.99
a thk in their systems priced across
well over twenty five hundred US dollars
all the other components are fairly
standard stuff there's aimed a Radeon
pro graphics configurable up to a Vega
20 model a 15 inch high-resolution
display and so on but the inclusion of
an eight core CPU is intriguing because
we know that Apple's slim MacBook Pro
design couldn't really handle the
previous core I nine six core CPUs for
that serious head and throttling issues
so to add in another two cores which
will need more power despite what
Intel's 45 watt TDP tells you is going
to stress this cooler out massively
I'm interested to know just how much
faster these new laptops are in the real
world when people start reviewing them
apple claims up to a 40% improvement but
that seems a bit far-fetched unless you
live in Antarctica I've got three
monitor stories for you this week as
well that I'll run through quickly first
up is something TFT central spotted on
the AMD website a new monitor from
gigabyte called the aura SCADA
25f it's a 25 inch 1080p monitor with
the 240 Hertz refresh rate and of course
free sync support that's all the details
we have right now but it sounds like the
prime candidate for something to be
shown at Computex next we have the AOC
AG 271 F 2 Z 2 another good spot from
tier 2 central this is another 25 inch
1080p 240 Hertz displays so maybe we'll
get a new wave of these panels
throughout the year anyway this one has
a 0.5 millisecond M PRT response time
which means there's some sort of
backlight strobing going on there also
we have variable refresh rates and
factory calibration though no word on
release info final monitor I wanted to
talk about is the Philips 328 a 1c a
nothing super exciting here but it is a
31 point five inch 4k display with the
curved VA panel it's ready for K
monitors using VA tech so that's why I
wanted to highlight it here but it's
nothing super crazy from the looks of it
couple of quicker topics to round this
one out as always EA has new hair
technology for frostbite which they've
taste in a pretty cool video developed
by frostbite engineers on the physics
and rendering team assisted by criterion
the new frostbite strand hair technology
looks like one of the best
implementations yet specific attention
has been paid to getting the color and
volume correct for human hair it'll be
interesting to see how long it takes for
this tech to be implemented in games and
crucially what the performance it is
like Nvidia hair works for example is in
effect that many people disable
immediately because it causes a massive
framerate drop hopefully frostbite tech
isn't as intensive and lastly HP has
entered the high-end gaming peripheral
market with the mouse and some
accessories using the omen brand which
they've used previously for gaming stuff
they've launched the omen photon
wireless mouse which has a unique
ambidextrous shape and a 16,000 dpi
sensor from Pixar the wireless tech used
allows a quick response time of just 0.2
milliseconds and it can be charged
through a cable or HP's outpost mousepad
which integrates a qi wireless charger
the gaming peripheral market is
absolutely loaded with competition
sounds interesting HP felt now is the
best time to launch new products
considering what they are going up
against it might be hard for them to
gain any traction anyway that's it for
