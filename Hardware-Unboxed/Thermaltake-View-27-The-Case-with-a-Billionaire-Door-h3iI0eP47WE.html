over the last few years amongst
enthusiasts builders though I suspect
for many the appeal hasn't been the vast
amount of room for expansion rather it's
those massive window panels found on
cases such as the Corsair graphite 760 T
and coolermaster cosmos se for example
after all if you can't show off all that
gaming gear what's the point of having
it to the next level recently there's
been an onslaught of tempered glass
cases I have to admit they do look
pretty but like most pretty transparent
things they aren't cheap so what is a PC
building fanatic to do ok so this
situation isn't nearly as blue because
I've made it out to be there are
literally hundreds of affordable
mid-tower options available and yet none
of them look anything like the one I
have here today the new Thermaltake view
27 case offers on lookers a bird's eye
view of the build thanks to what I've
dubbed the billionaires case door of my
recent unboxing video essentially what
we have here is a large Golding window
panel that continuously spares the
entire left side and top of the case
thermaltake have already shown off a few
very cool-looking custom hard pipe
liquid cool setups in the view 27 I
suspect this will be a very attractive
case of models and tweakers much like
the Corp III we recently played around
with for the most part the view 27 does
favour form over function and this is
most prominent when looking at that
curved window panel as the window does
cover much of the side on top of the
case it means ventilation has been
sacrificed here to overcome this lack of
ventilation Thermaltake has been forced
to include as much front intake and rear
exhaust ventilation as possible
again it is a case of form over function
as that added front ventilation means
the external drive bay has been left out
that said this is a forwarded thermal
take the luxury of offering support for
large front mounted radiators measuring
up to 360 millimetres of course this
means you can also install the trio of
120 millimeter fans up front as well
which you need to do is the case comes
with no front mounted fans additionally
it is possible to install a 120
millimeter fan in the bottom of the case
included out of the box is the sing
all pre-installed RIA 120-millimeter fan
externally the view 27 looks pretty good
particularly for a budget case from the
front we find a tinted panel which looks
very impressive with a few LED fans
installed behind it very reminiscent of
the m18 of five it has to be stabbed
above that is a basic i/o panel offering
just a single USB 3 port 2 USB 2 port
audio jacks along with power and reset
buttons ventilation is featured on
either side of the front plastic panel
and I like how the edges of the case
when give it a bullnose finish which is
pretty sleek removing the panel we find
a large removable dust filter along with
filters down either side of the panel
it's a pretty low-budget affair but it
will do the job around the back we find
a fairly typical layout the only oddity
here are two vertically mounted
expansion slides and I'll get to those
shortly there are six thumb screws to
holding in the right-hand panel with
four securing the left / top panel
underneath we find feet that are more
like rails keeping the case up off the
ground there also looks to be accessed
for securing an internal two and a half
inch storage drive inside everything is
very easy to access largely thanks to
that going door in the main chamber we
find the motherboard tray which supports
standard ATX boards along with a good
number of cable management holes there
are mounting locations for three two and
a half inch drives along with a fourth
on the rear side then hidden in the
bottom of the case the two three and a
half inch plastic drive cages in total
there are ten expansion slots which is a
huge amount for a mid Tower as mentioned
earlier there are two extra vertically
mounted brackets which use to vertically
mount the graphics card this allows
gamers to better show off their AMD or
nvidia card
unfortunately the required rise cable
isn't included in the package but can be
purchased separately for a rather costly
35 buzzy or 30 u.s. regardless of how
you mount the graphics card there's room
for cards as long as four hundred and
ten millimeters without the front fan
installed so in short you won't have an
issue installing even the biggest of
gaming graphics cards while on the
subject of clearance it's possible to
squeeze in a 155 millimeter tall CPU
cooler and a 180 millimeter long power
supply that's some pretty impressive
hardware support for an ATX case giving
it measures just 508 millimeters tall
479 millimeters deep and just 201 mm
while for a steel and plastic built case
the view 27 ways of very reasonable 6.4
kilos the aesthetics might have taken a
priority outside but inside the view 27
is all business building inside the view
27 is about as easy as it gets
especially if you're keen on putting
together a clean build the separate
basement area really helps here allowing
any excess cables to be tucked away the
tool free design also helps make
installation a breeze I tried a few
different hardware configurations inside
the Vue 27 run into any issues again
this is a budget case so things like
rubber grommets on the cable management
holes are missing and this steel is a
bit thinner than you might find and more
expensive models still the lantern
design is excellent there's also just a
single 120mm fan which I have to admit
is a bit disappointing even at this
price I would have liked a second one up
front particularly given the PCI rise
cable isn't included the only other
concern with this case is its key
feature the plexiglass window these
things are a serious dust magnet and
unless you have the softest of cloth
cleaning them often leads to mass
cuffing keeping cheap plexiglass windows
looking new is next to impossible and
this is the very reason why the industry
is shifting to tempered glass on a side
note the Goldwing panel is quite
difficult to remove and then reinstall
but I guess you shouldn't be doing that
too often at this point I don't have a
standard hardware configuration I use
for tests and case thermals noise the
view 27 only comes with a single fan
anyway so results are going to vary
depending on how you configure it
despite the unusual design there's room
for a decent amount of cooling upgrade
so boosting airflow won't be an issue
still I keep coming back to one thing in
my mind the price at just ninety
Australian dollars the thermal take view
27 isn't exactly expensive for a case of
this caliber to this day I still
maintain that the deep cool tesseract SW
is the best value mid tower money can
buy and it's $60 it's still a good bit
cheaper but certainly doesn't offer the
unique design of the view 27 for similar
money we find the in win 503 and
Silverstone redline both nice cases in
their own right but neither for me have
the wow factor of the view 27 what do
