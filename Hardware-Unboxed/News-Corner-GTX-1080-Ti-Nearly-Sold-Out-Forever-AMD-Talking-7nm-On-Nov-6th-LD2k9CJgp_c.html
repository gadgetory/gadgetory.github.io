corner our second episode for this week
coming to you on this fine Sunday
afternoon a couple of interesting topics
to discuss this week but first today's
video has been sponsored by as rock and
their new phantom gaming range of said
390 motherboards the Zed 390 phantom
gaming 6 and 9 include a blazing fast
2.5 gear bits per second network
interface offering gamers and content
creators 2.5 times the bandwidth
compared to the standard Gigabit
Ethernet for more information please
check the link in the video description
so for the first topic in today's
episode I wanted to return to the
discussion of dead or dying
Nvidia RT X cards which we covered as
our main story in news corner earlier in
the week we don't have a ton of new
information to go over but we are seeing
more reports of failures and issues
relating to RTX cards since this news
broke so it seems like I guess more
people coming forward to report issues
now that they know their problems
perhaps weren't an unlucky one-off as we
mentioned earlier the general trend to
these issues appears to be at least
somewhat related to the founders edition
PCB as pretty much every failed card has
either been a founders edition model
directly from Nvidia or a board partner
card that uses the founders Edition PCB
design AIB cards that use a custom PCB
and that's most io v cards seem to be
unaffected I still want to stress though
that while the founders edition PCB
appears to be correlated to the failures
we still aren't sure what is exactly
causing the problems there is a report
from Tom's Hardware suggesting GDD are
six temperatures are exceeding the 95
degrees Celsius safe operating limit set
by a manufacturer micron potentially due
to the founders edition cooler design
and the layer of the PCB disease vrm
power tracks run directly under some jdd
are six modules we've also heard about a
potential GDD are six bidding issue with
an earlier batch of r-tx cards that has
been resolved with new production runs
and we've also heard some reports that
some users can get their cards working
through underclocking the memory though
this trick it doesn't appear to be
working for everyone
but their theme at this stage is that
they are just reports there's nothing
concrete linking one specific problem to
the failures so with that in mind we
actually want to point you all to gamers
Nexus because currently longhead Steve
and his crew over there
are trying to get a collection of failed
RTX cards on hand to try and isolate the
specific issue the guys over there do a
great job with these sorts of
investigations so we're going to leave
this one to them and wait for their
findings because they'll get a
definitive answer to this whole mess
crucially though if any of you guys do
have a failed RTX card that you haven't
sent back through an RMA process yet we
encourage you to get in touch with
gamers Nexus and arrange for them to
borrow the card so they can get to the
bottom of this the more dead cards they
have on hand for easier it will be to
isolate the problem they've set up an
email address for people to use to get
in contact with them that email is dead
xx atti @ gamers nexus net and they're
asking you to provide information on
your failed card what it's doing and
what country you live in
we also have links in the description
below to their reddit thread and news
post about their investigation so check
that out for any further information and
we'll leave it over to the guys at games
Nexus to get back to us on what is
exactly causing all these failed cards
our second major topic for this week
involves NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti
stock as you might know we follow
graphics card stock and pricing closely
for our series that covers the best
value GPUs on the market and we noticed
a few troubling signs relating to the
1080 Ti earlier this week and I think
games Nix has also found something
similar in their latest news episode
anyway the main story here is that the
GTX 10 ATT I stock well it's nearly all
gone and it's not coming back with the
Arctic's 2080 in town effectively
replacing the 1080 TI Nvidia has ended
production for the flagship consumer
Pascal part so once the final batch of
cards has been sold that's it this was I
guess it was always going to happen once
Troon was released it was only a matter
of how long before 1080 T eyes would run
out and appears we're now reaching that
point if you browse popular retailers
like Newegg and Amazon there are far
fewer 1080 TI cards available to
purchase now than there were a couple of
weeks ago pricing has also increased
drastically in mid-october cards were
available for as low as 700 u.s. dollars
now the cheapest card is a gigabyte
horse model for seven
hundred and sixty dollars and the next
cheapest card is nearly 800 with several
other cards selling for around the
$1,000 mark and here in Australia at our
favorite retailer PC case key there is
only one 1082 our models still in stock
once these cards sell out the 1080 TI
will no longer be available to buy new
from retailers and that's really bad
news for gamers who are after a high end
GPU because the r-tx 20/80 that is
replacing the 1080i is currently still
selling for around $800 which is $100
more than the 1080 TI was selling for
and in our review we found that the 2080
was only 1% faster than the 1080 TI in a
35 game average at 1440p and 4k so
what's the remaining 10 LED eyes sell
out gamers will basically have to spend
$100 more to get the exact same
performance that was available for a
lower price with a previous generation
product so that's pretty painful but
it's really not surprising that the 1080
eyes have sold that quickly and won't be
replenished and video was essentially
competing with themselves they released
the 2080 onto the market at a high price
and it just wasn't as attractive to buy
up against in videos own 1080 TI so it's
no surprise that buyers flock to the
1080 TI instead going forward it makes
sense that Nvidia would focus on their
newer RT X cards rather than trying to
sell you know Turing in Pascal at the
same price points in better news for
gamers Nvidia sundar Pascal cards are
still in plentiful stock so you can
still buy a GTX Tonelli for around four
hundred and forty dollars making it a
better option than the RT X 2070 at
around $500 while the 2070 is 7% faster
than the 1080 is 14% more expensive in a
best-case scenario though like the gtx
1080i we expect GT X 1080 stock will run
out at some point and buyers will only
be left with the worst value 2070 as the
only option at some point in the future
AMD is set to host an event dubbed next
horizon in just a few days on November
6th the event was posted on the Investor
Relations website and was mentioned in
their earnings call as well though
details are still a little light on at
this stage the company is only stating
at this point that the event will cover
innovation of AMD products and
technology specifically designed with a
data center on industry-leading set
nanometer process technology this fits
with what we've been hearing about AMD's
upcoming event it's more focused on the
enterprise and data center side of their
business so we can expect to hear about
their first seven nanometer products
including second-generation epic CPUs
and seven nanometer Vega GPUs I wouldn't
be expecting too much on the consumer
side AMD is planning to use their CES
events to discuss seven animated as well
in early 2019 and will almost certainly
focus on consumer products like third
gen rice and at that event what's
unclear is where the next Horizons will
be used to unveil the rx 590 which has
been the subject of a ton of rumors over
the past couple of weeks
considering the focus on enterprise and
data center launching a mid-range
consumer GPU at the event but wouldn't
really fit in with the rest of the
content but who knows what AMD will be
covering it's probably an event to keep
your eye on though if you are interested
in the RX 590 just in case they sneak it
in there somewhere
battlefield 5 system requirements have
been unveiled which I guess it isn't
normally news that is interesting enough
to put in news corner but unlike with
other games battlefield 5 implements
DirectX ray-tracing and supports
invidious r-tx
technology so dice has listed
requirements specifically for DXR this
is the first time we're hearing directly
from a game developer about what
hardware is actually required to run ray
tracing in their game so battlefield 5
requires an NVIDIA GeForce r-tx 2070 or
higher to run DXR which I guess it
shouldn't come as a surprise that's the
lowest tier card that supports DirectX
ray-tracing
there's no word on what level of ray
tracing the RT X 2070 will enable
because presumably there will be you
know several different levels of ray
tracing that will be usable depending on
which ITX card you have but at least our
TX 2070 owners will be able to use ray
tracing in this game just at an unknown
quality level what is a little
surprising is the other system
requirements for DX I dice lists either
are risin 720 700 or Intel Core i7 8700
as a required CPU which is much higher
than the Rison 3 1300 X or Intel Core i7
4790 they are as recommended for the
again they also list 60 gigabytes of RAM
for DX er up from 12 gigabytes in the
recommen
spec's and of course you need the
windows 10 October 2018 update version
1809 to support dxr that said dice
didn't say what sort of resolution or
framerate they are targeting for their
decks our recommended requirements but
considering what developers usually
target which is 1080p 60fps we're
looking at needing a high-end PC to get
decks are running at a modest resolution
again probably not a surprise
considering what we saw from our TX
demos earlier this year
fallout 76 is looking like another
typical Bethesda Game Studios title on
PC and that is of course a complete mess
apparently the game still Tides physics
simulations to the framerate a major
flaw of the terrible creation engine the
game uses but to make matters worse this
is a multiplayer only title so when
someone runs the game with an unlocked
framerate they will move much faster
than everyone else in the game world
running with an unlocked framerate
during the beta was as easy as modifying
and any file to remove the frame cap
it's actually amazing to me that this
issue was present in the fall at 76 beta
considering that this was a known issue
with past bethesda games like fallout 4
this really should have been fixed well
before the beta was released but at
least having a better period has allowed
users to report the problem so they can
fix it ahead of the full release in a
few weeks there's of course if Bethesda
can even fix the problem before then it
seems like a fundamental issue with the
game engine and may be very complicated
to fix and if they don't fix it the game
will be a complete disaster on PC with
some players zooming around the map much
faster than others other issues with
fallout 76 at the moment include a
complete left of 21 9 aspect ratio
support another issue that was present
with fallout 4 and has gone unfixed
since then and apparently the
optimization of the game at the moment
is rather terrible
so I guess Steve and I certainly going
to have fun testing this game in a few
weeks it sounds just fantastic Corsair
has launched two new liquid coolers in
their hydro series the H 100i platinum
and H 115 a platinum the main changes
here compared to the h1 59 and H 100 I
Pro RGB models are well more RGB
lighting the fans are now upgraded to
use courses ml 120 or ML 140
RGB morals which have RGB lighting of
course while the pump head now has a
ring of sixteen addressable RGB lights
as well the H 100 i Platinum costs one
hundred and sixty dollars so that's
forty dollars more than H 100 I pro RGB
while the H 115 i Platinum is one
hundred and seventy dollars up thirty
dollars from the H 115 I Pro RGB final
topic of this week destiny 2 is
currently free to permanently keep if
you download it before November 18
through battlenet on PC yep that's right
all you have to do is log in to your
battlenet account and download destiny 2
before that date and you can keep the
game linked to your account forever
the game's DLC isn't included with this
offer but hey you know it's still a
pretty great deal if you haven't played
the game and want to give it a try
