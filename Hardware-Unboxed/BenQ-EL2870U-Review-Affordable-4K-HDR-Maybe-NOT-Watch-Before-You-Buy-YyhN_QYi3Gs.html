out that entry-level 4k gaming monitors
are pretty cheap these days you can find
plenty of options for s than $500 us and
some of the absolute cheapest options
are available for less than 350 bucks
today I'm not looking at the absolute
cheapest 4k monitor on the market but
one the cost around 450 dollars and
promises HDI in addition to one
millisecond response times the monitor
is the Ben QL 2870 you it's nothing
fancy it's a 28 inch 3840 by 2160 TN
panel at 60 Hertz basically just your
regular 4k monitor specs it does support
freesync but the refresh rate range is
just 40 to 60 Hertz so it doesn't
support low framerate compensation which
is a bit disappointing Ben Q also makes
a big deal about this panel supporting
HDR and specifically HDR 10 but well I
guess we'll talk about HDR later the
design this is an entry-level monitor so
I wasn't expecting anything fancy but
the L 2870 U is a bit of a chunky beast
not just in the overall thickness of the
panel but also in the bezels and 18
millimeters in thickness this is
definitely not a slim bezel display and
to make matters worse the panel itself
isn't flush with the bezels instead it's
set back about four millimeters
I appreciate been cues choice not to
include a lot of gamer junk but the
large bezels and recessed display make
it look pretty cheap the displays out of
construction is also a cheap basic
plastic with a bog-standard finish the
stand uses an uncommon I guess you'd
have to say t-shaped design and the
front section at first glance looks like
it might be metal but on closer
inspection its basic plastic with a
brush texture the rest of the stand uses
black glossy plastic which is an
absolute nightmare to keep dust and
fingerprint free in terms of
adjustability again everything is very
basic is the stand only supports tilt
adjustment though there is a visa
mounting support for inputs we get two
HDMI 2.0 ports and DisplayPort 1.4 plus
a headphone jack and yes there are
built-in speakers you also might have
noticed this lump below the BenQ logo on
the
that's an ambient light sensor that
forms part of Bank whose brightness
intelligence plus technology or bi+
basically with this mode enabled the
monitor will automatically adjust
brightness color temperature to fit your
surroundings that's pretty neat for
those that like this sort of
functionality but personally I prefer a
static brightness and especially static
color temperatures such that color
accuracy is maintained the bi+ mode is
enabled through a button on the front
panel which also doubles as an HDR
button but don't get fooled the SGR mode
is either force enabled when windows HDR
and WCG setting is enabled or it can be
toggled to simulate HDR when the monitor
is receiving an SDR input and my
simulate I mean mess with the colors and
saturation to make the image less
accurate
the rest of the displays controls are
accessed through a row of basic buttons
so no directional toggle which makes the
OSD hard to navigate there's a healthy
selection of color controls to be found
in the OSD but a lot of bank use other
features I'd never bother enabling like
the low blue light mode the super
resolution mode or the plethora of
display modes let's talk about HDR
because the e-l 2870 use support of HDR
is listed as practically the first item
on bankers website it's also one of the
few 28 inch 4k TN monitors to support
HDR which I suspect is why it's been
marketed around $100 more than the
cheapest monitors of equivalent specs
but in reality that helps when he hit 70
U is not an HDR monitor it fails to
support the three pillars of good HDR
which are increased brightness increased
contrast and increased color space and
it fails almost every item in my HDR
display checklist which I discussed in
this video one of the corners will have
that there I could do a comprehensive
analysis of this monitor in the HDR mode
but the checklist really tells the whole
story this panel is only capable of 300
nits of peak brightness which isn't even
enough to get the panel display HDR 400
certified 300 minutes is not enough to
convey bright highlights or flashes so
you'll be left with an SDR viewing
experience in that regard the panel does
not support local dimming of any kind a
local dimming is key for LCD panels as
it allows very bright and very dark
areas to coexist on the screen at the
same time essentially raising the
contour
ratio of the panel without local dimming
this monitor is stuck in its basic a
thousand to 1 contrast ratio which isn't
high enough to convey the high dynamic
range aspect of HDR the panel can adjust
its entire backlight on-the-fly similar
to traditional dynamic contrast modes
but this is only useful when lighting
changes between scenes or frames not
when lighting differs within the frame
and the backlight can't even get that
bright anyway so again an SDR experience
and finally the panel doesn't support a
gamut larger than srgb so you're getting
SDR level colors rather than the wider
gamut supported by true HDR displays
BenQ does this 10-bit color support
which is true and this is the most basic
requirement of H John is really the only
requirement to support HDR 10 and
windows WCG mode and it's only 10 bit
processing anyway the panel itself is 8
bit plus FRC I did test the HDR mode
briefly but it was immediately clear
this panel can't match true HDR displays
as you would have seen in the checklist
anyway thank you really shouldn't be
marketing this monitor as an HDR monitor
and recommend anyone buying it just keep
it on the STR mode moving on from that
let's look at SDR performance because
there's a chance this monitor could
still be as standout you know non HDR
display as we're still talking about an
entry-level product this monitor does
use a TN panel so viewing angles the
average though surprisingly not terrible
as I expect you for this technology
brightness is acceptable for most indoor
users at around 285 myths which falls a
touch short of BenQ 300 nits claim
contrast ratio though it's one of the
weak aspects of its performance of just
822 one or thereabouts TN is the worst
technology for contrast ratio and that's
on show once again with these mediocre
out-of-the-box results default color
performance is average not terrible not
amazing just fine for an entry-level
display a grayscale delta a average of
3.0 is again hits pretty average but
like with a lot of monitors the CCT
average is a little wacky out of the
factory the most disappointing aspect is
the default gamma of below 2.0 which
really should be to point to as shipped
performance is similar in saturation and
color checker tests with Delta averages
between 3.0 and 4.0 no standout issues
here just a typical out of the box
experience when this sort of display it
is possible to improve performance
through tweaking a few OSD settings
using these settings here which mostly
focus on user color changes I was able
to improve the grayscale delta-e to 1.90
and largely fix the gamma curve although
gamma is slightly too high now it's also
very difficult to fix the CCT curve
without full calibration hence the weird
shape is seeing here saturation and
color checker tests do improve thanks to
these tweaks but we're still not in the
territory of a fully calibrated display
at least when looking at the color
checker results that said this is a
pretty decent result from me OSD
calibration plenty of displays don't
allow you to get to this point as you
might expect running a full calibration
using spectral cows Kalman 5 software
tightens up most areas of this displays
performance we get much better gamma and
CCT curves both saturation and color
checker tests are tightened to a delta a
average under 2.0 that said as you can
see from the saturation chart blue
performance remains a little loose
despite calibration the good news is
calibration doesn't impact the contrast
ratio significantly falling to around
800 and one-to-one which is better than
other TN panels I've tested calibrated
power consumption is also decent for a
display of this size at 52 watts as we
displayed uniformly well the e/l 2870 u
isn't exactly the most uniform display
though high grade uniformity is
typically reserved for professional
monitors rather than budget displays
like this one still I'd like to see a
more uniform backlight especially as
this isn't a curved display edge
uniformity is slightly better than some
curve displays I've reviewed but it's
not as fantastic as other flat panels
now we get into the interesting stuff
response times Ben Q has used a TN panel
here and claimed one millisecond
response time so I guess it's a typical
figure 40 and displays however in
practice average grade gray response
times aren't even close to 1 millisecond
I recorded a 6 point 5 3 millisecond
average and there were only a few
transitions that approached 1
millisecond 50% white to black was
around 1.3 milliseconds and full white
to full black around 2.0 milliseconds
but most other transitions were well
above the 5 to 6 millisecond mark so
once again we've got a manufacturer
using an unrealistic minimum grader gray
metric
than an average this TN monitor is also
pretty slow in general a 6.5 millisecond
average puts it well in the territory of
VA and IPS displays but without the
benefit of those panels like increased
contrast ratios and superior viewing
angles transitions were within the 16.7
millisecond refresh rate window but the
results are still very disappointing for
a TN panel it gets even worse when you
factor in the input lag the e/l 2870 u
is the slowest display I've tested so
far with a significant amount of input
lag I'm not quite sure what the panel is
doing perhaps Bank you simply opted for
a cheap and slow scale I guess whatever
is the case there's a lot of input lag
which is not great news for gamers
there's not a whole lot more to say on
the Ben QL 28 7 to you it's on the
cheaper end of 4k monitors with the TN
panel and basic design and across our
performance tests this monitor ranges
from average to poor it's possible to
calibrate the monitor to a reasonable
enough standard using OSD controls but
uniformity is poor as our response times
an input lag particularly for a tiered
display the e L 2870 U is currently
available for four hundred and forty
dollars which is to be honest a bit too
expensive for what this monitor offers I
don't see any compelling reason to buy
the spend cue option over 300 to $350
monitors with near identical specs from
Samsung LG or others especially
considering this monitors chunky and
unimpressive design if HDR was
legitimately functional and worked well
then perhaps you could justify spending
an extra hundred bucks to get HDR but
this isn't a true HDR monitored despite
bank use advertising so it's definitely
not worth even considering its HDR
support in your purchasing decision it's
a disappointing conclusion really I like
budget displays and it's great to see
such cheap 4k monitors on the market
these days but budget conscious shoppers
should have their eyes on the plethora
of $300 options instead that's it for
