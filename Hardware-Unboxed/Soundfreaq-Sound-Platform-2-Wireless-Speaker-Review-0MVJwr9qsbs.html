speaker solution to rest permanently on
my bedside table for some time I really
like listening to music before bed and
it's great to have options for Bluetooth
octillery and more this is what
attracted me to the sound free sound
platform - it has a broad featureless
and attractive price tag and it looks
nice so is it my perfect bedside
companion let's take a look and find out
overall it's a rather simple design
there's nothing really flashy about it I
definitely like this for an item that we
rest in bedrooms living rooms and
kitchens it's black all around with two
mesh panels concealing the speakers at
the front behind which you'll find a
long white status light the case is
plastic all around with horizontal lines
wrapping the speaker and encasing the
sound free clothes humbly positioned on
the rear of the speaker the top side
includes an angled divot that contains
the touch capacitive buttons that
control the device on top you'll find
the source toggle and volume controls at
the far left followed by a turn button
for changing the eq between a bright
warm or neutral preset uq3 which I'll
talk about a bit later and the pairing
button at the other end of the speaker
you'll simply find skip forward and back
play and pause the LCD display and the
power button the rear of the unit holds
a very nifty little input and control
panel there's a few features here that I
really really like on the left there are
two powered USB ports when you can hook
up two devices to charge via USB
charging cable got a phone in a tablet
no problems need to charge yours and
your partner's phone consider it done
all through one power outlet - in terms
of other ports there's the DC in for the
power cable three-and-a-half millimeter
auxiliary input and a spot for the
supplied FM antenna these are all angled
completely sideways which is a really
great touch and allows you to place the
unit as close as possible to the wall
behind it nearby there's a button to
turn on or off the light I mentioned
earlier on the front of the unit which
is great for those wanting to use it in
dark environments such as bedrooms and
finally there's a Power Save switch the
toggles on or off a timeout function
where the device will turn off after 30
minutes of inactivity the platform 2
also features DSS dual system streaming
it's now popular Bluetooth speaker
feature allows you to connect to and
stream to two platform twos
simultaneously from the one device which
of course allows for much better and
loudest
Aereo sound I wasn't able to test this
with the platform too specifically as I
only have one unit on hand but it's a
feature of used on other systems and it
usually works pretty well unlike the
original platform model the platform
two-four go is a dedicated mode control
to instead offer an app for both Apple
and Android devices the app works pretty
seamlessly with a single unit and I
believe the only thing you can't control
remotely is the turn button which you
can of course control on the unit itself
at the front bottom of the unit is a
little tray that slides out to allow you
to rest your device like a dock rather
cleverly there's a port right through to
the back of the unit so you can run your
USB charging cable to the device as well
as a three-and-a-half millimeter
auxiliary cable to input sound this is
definitely clover that's for sure
however I didn't find out actually ever
personally used it and was easier to
just rest my phone on top of the unit
when I had cables attached especially
the sound on the platform to is suited
especially to a bedroom in my opinion
the twin 3 inch drivers produce a really
great sound in high range favoring
stringed instruments and acoustics for
bass lovers though this probably isn't
unified and if you want to use this
thing to host a party then you want to
be in a small room it just isn't very
loud but the sounder does deliver is
really clear and crisp treble is
delivered with impressive accuracy and
for bedtime listening the unit really is
perfect the bedroom neighbors won't even
be upset by annoying far-reaching bass
it's only when pushed to its highest
volume does the device start to sound
like it's going to distort although
without ever really doing so overall the
sound freaks down platform 2 is a
feature-rich and flexible solution
that's extremely well priced available
for just a hundred and forty dollars in
both USA and Australia I can't think of
a better option to sit on my bedside
table and that's exactly what it's going
to sit for quite some time
admittedly the bass is quite weak but
the upper end sounds are pretty
exceptional for this sort of price range
and the feature set of a speaker goes
close to unmatched sound free did their
best to think of everything with the
sound platform too and personally I'd
love to see a slightly bigger iteration
with a broader louder sound range the
packed in all of the same clever
features let me know what you guys think
in the comments and if you know of any
other speaker that can compete with this
thing in this sort of price range then
I'd love to hear about it
