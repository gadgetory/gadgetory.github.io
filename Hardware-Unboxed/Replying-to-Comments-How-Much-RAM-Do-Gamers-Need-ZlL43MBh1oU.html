gonna try something new the plan is to
review feedback given by you guys the
viewers on a recent video and as a
guinea pig episode 2 what could
potentially become a semi-regular series
I've chosen the how much RAM to gamers
knee video from a little over a week ago
so the idea isn't to call people out or
anything like that although I'm sure
there will be the odd funny comment here
and there that we can address but anyway
the idea is to follow up on your
feedback was there something that I
missed something that I got wrong or
just something that you would have liked
to have seen me cover in a bit more
detail now since this is a guinea pig
episode please let me know if you found
it enjoyable interesting yeah just do
that in the comment section below and of
course if you thought that it sucked and
you don't want to see any more replying
to comments type videos or episodes then
please also let me know about that in
the comment section below
today's video sponsor is Skillshare the
online learning community where you can
learn real-world skills I've always
found it easiest to learn by watching
others and with skill share you can do
exactly that as professionals correct
project-based classes covering topics
such as design business technology film
photography and much more it's a great
resource for those looking to improve
their skill set a sure passion or
advance their careers and the best bit
is for the first 500 viewers to sign up
you will get the first two months of
skill share premium for free so it
doesn't get much better than that check
the link in the video description ok so
let's get into it
Johnny X Y Z pointed out something
interesting that I only touched on
briefly in the video not exactly the
same thing that he's talking about here
but kind of similar anyway what he said
was the really interesting thing is that
you're able to buy 578 gear but instead
of the 4 gigabyte version for the money
of a caballo ddr4 so I think he's trying
to say the cost of 8 gigabytes of ddr4
memory they're basically the 8 gigabyte
version of the rx 570 costs $30 more
than the 4 gigabyte version while 16
gigabytes of ddr4 costs $40
more than 8 gigabytes so it's not quite
the total cost of 8 gigabytes worth of
RAM it's only about half as much still
if you had to compromise on one it would
actually be better to do so with the RAM
so instead of getting 16 gigabytes of
RAM just get 8 gigabytes and that is
because the full gigabyte RX 570 really
does need 16 gigabytes of RAM to avoid
stuttering and a lot of modern titles so
if you can get the 8 gigabyte version
it's probably going to give you a better
gaming experience that is assuring me
that you using ultra quality settings at
well at least 1080p maybe 1440p it's
probably stretching it a little bit
there either way that on that scenario
there is just a $10 difference depending
on which compromise you make of course
with 8 gigabytes of ddr4 3000 memory
price that's just $60 and 16 gigabytes
and $100 I suggest spending the extra
$40 to ensure all games run as smoothly
as possible
same goes for the graphics card if that
gear by version was $50 more say I'd
probably recommend the full gigabyte
model but for just a $30 premium it
makes sense to get the 8 gigabytes of
vram especially if you're not on an
extreme budget for those of you who are
on an extreme budget for gigabytes of
vram and 8 gigabytes of RAM will do and
particularly if you're playing less
demanding titles such as fortnight for
example just lastly on this one a much
better or much worse example depending
on how you look at it would be the
GeForce GTX 1063 gigabyte for those with
just 8 gigabytes of system memory the 6
year back version of the GTX 1060
provides significantly better
performance and that means saving the 50
something dollars when they're priced at
the MSRP for the 3 gigabyte model that
really isn't worth it
as you need to spend $40 more on memory
to avoid the noticeable stuttering in a
lot of the modern titles even at 1080p
rumor has it Nvidia is releasing a 3
gigabyte version of the r-tx 2060 in
2019 if that is the case I would urge
reviewers to test it with 8 gigabytes of
RAM at least for a couple of tests just
to see how much different it is compared
to what I believe will be the fully
fledged 6 gigabyte version and yet I'll
be doing a few benchmarks like that in
my day 1 coverage ok so next up we have
ng Russ ingress ingress commented I
don't know all just sorry if I don't get
all
right anyway the comment was something
along the lines of they can no longer
live without gigabytes of RAM not
because they need it for gaming because
they want to keep 30 browser tabs open
when playing games I saw quite a few
comments like this and it's fair enough
that said if you're jumping into
battlefield 5 and you're not constantly
out tapping out of the game then it
doesn't really matter this is because
the browser tab data is relocated from
the fast access memory to local storage
as you load the game so in other words
it's moved to the page file so as long
as the required game assets can be
stored in this system memory you won't
suffer any slowdowns or frame time
issues if you all tap out of a game
between rounds - I don't know watch a
youtube video check your email or
whatever reason you might have out of a
game between rounds or you have a second
screen which is probably a worst case
scenario with a YouTube video active
while you're playing I know that sounds
kind of odd but a lot of you guys in the
comments section claimed that you watch
YouTube videos while playing games so
that's impressive I'm usually pretty
flat out just concentrating on the game
but whatever the case may be this is
where more memory will really have an
impact because you're running a lot more
high priority processors so if you don't
have enough memory when you alt-tab so
forget about the second monitor for a
moment when you alt tab out of the game
the system will be very sluggish and
somewhat unresponsive while it
reshuffles things in and out of the
memory so we alt tab it'll prioritize
your browser again because you're using
that and then when you jump back in the
game it'll be much slower to do that and
in extreme cases the game might crash
but usually it's just quite slow so
you'll be presented with a black screen
for a longer period of time than you
would be otherwise with enough memory
and then you can get on with the gaming
and even then the gaming will probably
be a bit choppy for the first 30 to 60
seconds a user z4 v3k came at the
internet browser thing from a bit of a
different angle claiming that the
conditions that I tested with were
unrealistic as gamers close all that
stuff before gaming and I suppose again
well fair enough
but also again it really makes no
difference the results would have been
the same if I test it with a skeleton
crew of
processes on a fresh install of windows
or if I test it the way I did with a few
applications open such as steam origin
you play Chrome and so on and that 3
gigabytes of RAM that's claimed to be
sucked up by these unnecessary
applications it really isn't once you
execute your game again all that stuff
is moved to the slower local storage
into your page file and that makes way
for the higher priority data in this
case the game that you intend on playing
actually saw a memory capacity video
done by Linus tech tips earlier in the
year and they found a zero difference
between a clean install and then one
with loads of applications running which
included chrome tabs and all that sort
of stuff when they were gaming so well I
get where you're coming at and I agree
with some of the points you made I do
strongly disagree that the video was
misleading or unrealistic in any way
because of the reasons that I just
described if I had to disabled the
windows page file then yeah you might
have a point did you turn off windows
page file else all those background apps
will just go into page file right you
are sir right you are on that note you
might think why the hell did I bother
running all those applications if it
makes no difference at all as I've been
saying well the reason is you guys a few
years ago I did a memory capacity test
it wasn't the first one I did but it was
one of the one of the originals and I
had a whole lot of people complaining
that the test was unrealistic and that
US benchmark because they're out of
touch with the common gamer and yadda
yadda yadda because I was running just
the game and well the bare essentials no
chrome tabs or anything else in the
background at the time again I knew it
didn't make that much difference I knew
that stuff would get moved to the page
file and systems without enough memory
we had that upset a lot more people than
this method did last year that I used so
I'm sticking with it but that's the
reason why yeah it doesn't really make
much difference either way but I feel
like more people probably aren't that
keen to shut down everything they've got
open and then run their game it'll be
just more convenient if he was Randy
game and then go back to whatever it was
that you were doing before you played
the game ok so despite the testing done
in the previous video the video we're
discussing quite a few viewers agree
with what mr. freaked out
to say a gigabytes of memory will I
should do fine and 16 gigabytes is more
than enough mr. Frick did say that it's
important not to run memory in a
single-channel mode and well I couldn't
agree more with that as for the comments
on memory capacity again most titles I
will work just fine with a gigabytes of
RAM and we discussed what those tiles
would be in the in the video in question
but there are a number of modern
triple-a titles where you will see
frames stuttering if you only have 8
gigabytes of memory and we saw a 16
gigabytes all that sort of studdering
I did go away so it's in my opinion if
you're playing modern games 16 gigabytes
really should be the minimal
configuration that you want to use there
and that's very true for titles such as
battlefield 5 or shadow of the Tomb
Raider for example so nothing really
wrong with this comment just don't
assume that a gigabyte should do the job
for modern tiles because for some of
them it's simply not enough
I noticed that quite a few people
requested that I look into single versus
dual channel memory performance for
games and a lot of the requests wanted
me to look at both AMD and Intel CPUs I
really like this idea so that's
something I'll make happen probably in
January and I'll cover as many hardware
configurations as well humanly possible
the outcome will definitely be always
running dual channel so there'll be no
big surprises there but it would be nice
to see where dual channel has a real
advantage over a single channel so where
it makes the biggest difference what
sort of games what sort of settings and
that kind of stuff so so yeah well I'll
do that one soon here we go ah finally a
serious comment from none other than
jerod of Jarrod's Tech and he hit us
with a classic one-liner this was the
most up voted comment on my video that
took me weeks of work the human eye
can't see more than 9.3 gigabytes of
memory classic Jared a few guys aren't
familiar with Jared and while he's
channel Jarrod's tech be sure to check
that out I'll put a link in the video
description Jared I'll probably comment
on this video as well and it'll probably
be the most uploaded comment for reasons
unknown but you guys check out his
channel he does a great job of checking
out a whole lot of tech he mostly
focuses on gaming laptops some really
good
top coverage there so if you're
interested in gaming laptops then yeah
you definitely want to be subscribed to
Jarrod and if I haven't settled already
here's a fellow as a youtuber okay so
I'm not going to read out any individual
comments here because there was a whole
barrage of them so yeah I'm just going
to get into it with this one twelve
gigabytes of RAM now last year's memory
capacity video was littered with
comments asking why I didn't test with
the best bang for your buck memory
configuration twelve gigabytes now I
didn't address the twelve gigabyte
capacity thing in the 2018 version I
foolishly just assumed that most had
cottoned on by now but yeah I was wrong
on that one so yeah once again the most
heavily commented subject was twelve
gigabytes of RAM
why didn't I test with it it's the best
16 gigabytes as overkill get twelve so
on and so forth
in short you can't or well I shouldn't
say can't
in short you really shouldn't use twelve
gigabytes of memory on a platform using
ddr4 memory firstly you can't buy and
have never been out to buy two gigabyte
ddr4 memory modules they simply don't
exist so you can't have two four
gigabyte modules with two two gigabyte
modules for a dual channel twelve
gigabyte configuration that was
certainly possible with ddr3 but not
with ddr4 I should also note that
triple-channel platforms using three
four gigabyte modules also commonly had
a twelve gigabyte capacity but that's
not possible on dual channel systems
unless you want to cripple memory
performance but what about a 4 gigabyte
module with an 8 gigabyte module that's
certainly 12 gigabytes well you can do
that but again I strongly suggest you
don't for Rison owners this will
seriously cripple performance but even
those using an Intel platform are you
will be throwing away quite a bit of
performance Intel offers a flex mode
that allows a for an accurate module for
example to still run a dual channel
basically you get 4 gigabytes from each
module running a dual channel with the
odd 4 gigabytes left over running in the
single channel mode now admittedly this
is better than single channel operation
but it's nowhere near as good as true 4
gigabyte or 2 egg you bought modules in
dual channel in other words 2
evenly-matched sticks for example a
single 8 gigabyte ddr4 3,200 module
paired with the 99 rekha has a read
throughput of around 24 gigabytes per
second then pairing a 4 gigabyte module
with an 8 gigabyte module boost that to
around 34 gigabytes per second so that's
not too bad but to evenly-matched
modules so to 4 gigabyte or to a
gigabyte modules will allow a read
throughput a 46 gigabytes per second
that's an additional 35 percent memory
bandwidth and that doesn't go unnoticed
actually depending on the software you
use the bandwidth discrepancy can be
much larger than that I'd a 64 for
example measures the peak bandwidth and
that was the software I used to quote
all the numbers that I just did however
I usually prefer to use size soft
sandra's sustained memory bandwidth test
and here the matched modules offered 50%
more bandwidth in short performance and
battlefield 5 was much worse with 12
gigabytes of memory using the 4 plus 8
configuration compared to 2 full
gigabyte modules for an 8 gigabyte
capacity the 0.1% low frame time
performance improved by 13% with the
matched 4 gigabyte modules so for the
most part gamers are better off
sacrificing memory capacity for
bandwidth when it comes to comparing the
8 and 12 gigabyte configurations it's
probably a bit more to it why the
performance is a bit lopsided there with
the 12 gigabyte configuration but yeah I
did see similar things and shut off the
Tomb Raider and hitman 2 and not as
Extreme as what was seen in battlefield
5 but still the 8 gigabyte configuration
did allow for slightly better slightly
more consistent frame rates ok cube 1 V
X asked a pretty good question here
about benchmarking or testing load of
screen times a few people asked this few
different people and no other questions
or comments with that heavily uploaded
by I suppose of the rest of you but here
there was enough people asking why I
didn't test this so yeah I thought I
would answer that one so basically the
question is why in my memory capacity
benchmark video I didn't measure the
time it takes to load games and I
suppose load levels with the different
memory capacities and memory capacity
will certainly speed up things here
especially for those with
applications open in the background that
they don't want to close when they play
games again this is because all that
stuff will be moved from the system
memory to your local storage so the
lower priority stuff will be simply
moved to the page file and this means as
you load into games there's a bit of
shuffling going on and yet slows down
the process the reason I haven't done
this testing is because while memory
does have an impact are things such as
local storage and even the processor
impact load times far more still this is
something that I can look into in future
versions especially if a lot more of you
want to see this happen so you start
commenting you know benchmark load times
and low-level stuff with memory capacity
see what impact that has then yeah
that's something I could do in next
year's video and I think that would be
something I'd really like to look into
if 2019 is another year where 16
gigabytes of RAM is well it's the sweet
spot 32 gigabytes is overkill and well
it's the same as what we found last year
and this year so if that's the case then
you're testing something different might
shed some more light on the subject
okay so last comment or at least the
last one that I'm going to address there
was well over a thousand comments but I
picked the more interesting ones all the
ones that were more heavily upvoted like
Jared's the I can't see 9.3 gigabytes of
RAM whatever that hilarious comment was
anyway moving on we have one from soya I
can you test Ram speed for render
applications like blender yeah in short
yes I can and I actually am at the
moment so I suppose that's going to make
soya quite happy I am only doing it for
the 9900 Kay so no AMD testing at this
point we've done a bit of AMD memory
stuff when the second gen Rison
processors came out anyway
and yeah it's a lot of work doing memory
scaling benchmarking testing at least I
think it's at least eight different
memory frequencies and I'm testing quite
a few applications and a few games
I'm also doing some game resolution
testing a show where under realistic
conditions memory frequency may not
impact performance as much as what we
see in a lot of the benchmarks focusing
on 1080
or lower but anyway that should be a
very interesting video and one worth
keeping an eye out for well that is just
about going to do it for this first
episode of replying to comments again
please let me know if you enjoyed this
video and if you have any suggestions
for this well I suppose this potentially
new series yeah
just feel free to drop them below anyway
I hope this was an interesting recap of
the memory capacity video and it wasn't
really any negative comments everyone
was quite nice on that video and
fortunately I didn't make any mistakes
at least any that will point it out to
me apart from a few people questioning
why did certain things but I think I
stand by those so yeah anyway it was
probably not the most interesting video
to start with because there wasn't any
sort of little dramas surrounding it but
yeah let me know what you guys think as
always if you did enjoy the video feel
free to like button for us we always
much appreciate that I subscribe for
more content if you haven't already and
if you appreciate with your hair unbox
and you want to gain access to a few
little perks then you can start to our
patreon we have private discord channel
for the the dedicated harbor box members
let's say and we also do a monthly live
stream or two monthly live streams so
anyway that's enough about that
