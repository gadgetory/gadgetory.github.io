I'm box today we'll be taking a look at
this excellent laptop here the Lenovo
ThinkPad x1 carbon this is their
flagship ultra portable from their
business line of laptops so there's no
fancy features here but you do get solid
functionality and hardware across the
board as well as excellent engineering
that make this a laptop that I can
highly recommend before I talk about the
features of the sub top I will go
through the hardware it's in my review
net here this is an Intel Core i5 7200 u
processor with 8 gigabytes of RAM a 256
gigabyte SSD and a 1080p display so this
is the entry-level model there are a
number of configuration options
available that can take you up to a core
i7 CPUs as a 1440p display option one
terabyte SSDs and up to 16 gigabytes of
memory but of course that costs you a
bit more money there's a lot to like
about the design of the ThinkPad x1
carbon normally I'm a fan of the
all-metal bodies that you see from
things like the Apple MacBook or the HP
Spectre x-360 but lenovo has used soft
touch plastic around the entirety of
this body that looks really decent it's
minimalist and it feels great to hold it
also has the advantage of reducing the
overall weight of this laptop it's a 14
inch laptop but it weighs just 1.13
kilograms which is well below the
average that we see even for 13-inch
laptops at the moment this laptop won't
be turning any heads thanks to its
business oriented design but I
appreciate some of the features included
here like the 180 degree hinge which
gives you the most flexibility in
display positioning and some of the
subtle angles and curves around the
edges help hide some of the thickness of
this laptop though it's not a
particularly thick laptop in general
anyway the x1 carbon users perhaps the
best range of ports i've seen on a
laptop recently on the left hand side
you get to sundar bolt free ports both
of those are of course USBC and either
of them can be used for charging there's
also a full size USB 3.0 port full size
HDMI and a proprietary connector that is
used with the included Ethernet dongle
of course Ethernet ports are simply too
large to include on ultra portables like
this these days though
has compromised here by using a special
full bandwidth port on this device
specifically for Ethernet and I've
included the dongle in the box which is
a great inclusion to see here there's
also an additional full size USB 3.0
port on the right hand side as well as
the 3.5 mm audio jack and quite a
significant vent for the cooling
solution hidden away on the back edge of
the laptop is a micro SD and SIM card
slot it's really nice to see both of
these features included here you can
quite easily expand the storage of this
laptop without having dongles or
external devices hanging off all over
the place and LTE connectivity can be
very handy although this does cost extra
in some regions and models of the x1
carbon there is a fingerprint sensor
included below the keyboard on the x1
carbon and I really appreciate how a
number of laptop manufacturers are
including the security feature on the
ultra portable of these days the one of
the excellent carbon is it's very
responsive and it works extremely well
to secure your device it's much easier
than entering a pin or password every
time and I wish more laptops had this
sort of feature in it this wouldn't be a
ThinkPad laptop without the signature
keyboard that has been used for
generations it's quite good on the x1
carbon the travel distance from each key
is fantastic for an ultra portable and
this leads to great tactile feedback
across the board most of the keys are
very adequately sized such as the
modifier keys the function keys leaving
the arrow keys and this helps make the
laptop keyboard quite easy to get used
to and use on a daily basis that said
the worst feature of this entire laptop
is included in the keyboard on every
keyboard ever made except for the Lenovo
ThinkPad keyboard the control key is in
the bottom left hand corner of the
keyboard yet on this device you'll find
the function key in the bottom left hand
corner and this makes it really hard to
simply pick up this laptop and hit
things like ctrl-c and ctrl-v to copy
and paste without having to rewire your
brain it takes a long time getting used
to this key position and I simply wish
that Lenovo would keep a traditional
keyboard layout here and swap around the
function and control keys to make it
easier to use moving on to the
performance here and for the most part
across these benchmarks I'll be
comparing the Lenovo ThinkPad x1 carbon
to the Razer Blade stealth this gives us
a good comparison between the core i5
7200 you
and the core i7 7,500 u that's found in
the blade stealth for the most part the
i7 is a faster processor and this gives
you a good idea of whether you should
spend a bit more money on the i7 option
that you'll find for the ThinkPad x1 car
but whether it's worth spending that
extra money of course you can see some
other results in the charts as well to
see how it performs against some other
laptops on the market today we'll start
off here with the PC mark workloads and
looking at the home tests we'll see that
the core i5 CPU actually performs quite
well here compared to the blade stealth
outperforming it by 9%
but as we move on to the creative
workload you'll see that it falls behind
by 23% and that's due to of course the
higher clock speed provided by the core
i7 CPU and also a higher clock on the
GPU as well surprisingly in the werk
test both the x1 carbon and the blade
stealth performed similarly the blade
stealth is a few percent faster but for
the most part both devices give you a
fantastic work experience and things
like Excel spreadsheets and powerpoint
things like that and that's the main use
case for the x1 carbon here in Cinebench
are eleven point five which is one of
our encoding tests the Lenovo ThinkPad
x1 carbon is around five percent slower
than the razor blades Dell can both be
multi thread and single threaded tests
this is pretty typical thanks to the
extra clock speed get from the core i5
7500 u you'll see similar results in an
x264 encoding benchmark in part 1 of
this video rendering test the core i5
CPU is around 11% slower than the i7
7500 you but this margin is reduced to
4% in pass-through the benchmark which
is a pretty decent result here in the
winrar compression benchmark in our
multi-threaded test here you will see
that the cry 5 cpu is actually 12%
faster which is a bit of a surprise here
been a single-threaded workload it is 2%
slower so a bit of an interesting result
here but a good result for you think
about x1 carbon nonetheless if you're
wanting to run some simulations on your
laptop we can see here that in MATLAB
2016 the Core i5 CPU is 7.5 percent
slower than the core i7 CPU this is a
heavily single through
workload so the difference in clock
speeds here is quite telling although
surprisingly in the graphing benchmark
this core i5 CPU is 19.7% faster which
surprised me a little bit but again a
strong result for the x1 carbon
nonetheless they think that x1 carbon is
definitely not a gaming device by any
means and you'll definitely struggle to
run popular tiles at any sort of
reasonable frame rates not just on this
laptop but really any odds reportable
but we can see here in the 3d mark cloud
gate workload that compared to the 7500
you there's not really a massive
performance difference and even taking a
look at these skydiver tests as well the
i5 CPU in this laptop is only 4 percent
slower than the i7 laptop in the Razer
Blade stealth we will take a look at two
games though just in case you're
interested
having look at Tomb Raider which is an
older title these days running it at the
lowest possible settings at 720p we do
exceed 60 fps which is a decent result
but let's be honest I don't think too
many people will really want a game at
720p on a laptop that said it is 15%
slower than the Razer Blade stealth in
this particular benchmark we'll also
take a look at a civilization 6 and
again this game really isn't playable on
the lower settings at 1080p it struggles
to hit even just 20 or 25 frames per
second average there is one final thing
though on to look at in terms of
performance and that is SSD performance
we're looking at the 256 gigabyte nvm
APCR SSD inside of laptop and
performance across the board is very
solid with read and write sequential
speeds well above one gigabyte per
second and also looking at the RAM
performance 140 megabytes per second
random 4k writes and 557 megabytes per
second random reads is a very good
result from ultra portable miss leads to
fantastic uploading copying times and
the like on the ThinkPad x1 carbon it's
great to see that they're not skimping
on any sort of storage inside this
device another excellent aspect of the
ThinkPad x1 carbon is its battery life
there's only a 57 what our cell inside
which is not too large by today's
standards
but it still produces really solid
results in our benchmarks taking a look
at our video playback test which
essentially just loops a video 215 its
brightness until a laptop dies the
ThinkPad x1 carbon achieved just over
nine and a half hours which puts it in
the top end bracket of the laptop so
we've tested recently the HP spectre
x360 does our performance slightly but
this isn't too surprising consuming it
spectre x360 years a slightly smaller
display and a slightly larger battery
and looking at our Wi-Fi browsing
benchmark which loops through some
websites at we certain intervals in the
most popular browsers of today which is
google chrome at 200 minutes of
brightness you can see if you think that
x1 carbon actually tops the charts here
with just over seven hours of life and
this is a fantastic result for an ultra
portable and really a testament to
Lenovo's quality engineering that
they've put into the ThinkPad x1 carbon
before I jump into the conclusions worth
talking briefly about the display it's a
14 inch 1080p LCD with reasonably slim
bezels around the edge that makes it not
too large for a 14 inch laptop we'll
talk a bit about the color performance
here by jumping straight into spectra
Cal Cal Man 5 where we do all of our
color testing across our grayscale
Suites you can see a Delta II average of
3.8 4 which is not a fantastic result
but compared to some of the laptops you
find on the market today it's not too
bad a color temperature average across
the board and 200 nits of 7 1 8 1k not
again not a fantastic results but some
laptops do push that well into the 7000
or even eight thousand K range and color
calibration can definitely fix both the
Delta e greyscale and color temperature
average if you so desire to do that and
gamma again be disappointing at one
point nine seven seven I'd rather see
this at around 2.2 as you'd expect from
an sRGB calibrated display but I only
think it affects the performance of this
device too much in general looking at
our saturation sweeps and you can see
the average Delta value of 3.8 - again
not a fantastic result and this is
largely due to incorrect color
temperature of the display which you can
see as an effect here in the chart on
the right-hand side that Center white
dot isn't quite in the black center
Square and this is dragging most of
those other dots away from their
respective squares and perhaps the most
disappointing result of all within our
very intensive colorchecker test where
we saw an average delta value of just
four point seven five not too accurate
here and not great for color accurate
work but again most of the time you can
just calibrate this display and fix a
lot of these performance issues here and
again not too bad compared to some of
the other laptops that I've tested often
which can push above a Delta e of five
in some of these tests and just before
we move on brightness is something I
want to touch on three hundred and ten
nits maximum with a contrast ratio of
one thousand three hundred and
ninety-six so not too bad here in terms
of brightness and contrast and that
leads to generally quite nice-looking
images on this display at the end of the
day I really like the Lenovo ThinkPad x1
carpet I wish that wasn't over were
giving me more than just a couple of
weeks with this laptop it's a fantastic
device with solid Hardware across the
board I was really impressed with the
performance of just the core i5 CPU
inside this laptop often matching the
core i7 CPU in competing devices at
times the design very impressive love
this soft touch plastic body it reduces
the weight and gives it a minimalist
business-oriented look and feel the
keyboard generally quite good in terms
of its tactile feedback and
responsiveness not happy about the
decision of that function key but I hope
that lenovo it does address that in the
future and something I haven't touched
on before in this view as well the
trackpad is excellent and I love the
inclusion of that little red joystick
that you can use as an alternative to
the trackpad at times the display again
very good 14 inches 1080p reasonable not
terrible not excellent color performance
you can definitely calibrate to achieve
better results there and in terms of
battery life fantastic results topped
the charts in our Wi-Fi browsing test
and did very well in video playback as
well from just a 57 watt hour battery so
really the ThinkPad x1 carbon is almost
a complete package
you get great performance great battery
life a great design very good display
decent keyboard and trackpad and that's
exactly what you want from a laptop it
hits all the nails on the head you do
have to pay for quality though this is
an expensive
top in the United States at 1329 dollars
and for just a core i5 CPU a gigabytes
of RAM and a 128 gig SSD that's pretty
expensive and competing devices from HP
and Dell what's you similar hardware for
a cheaper price it's actually a bit more
affordable in Australia at one thousand
eight hundred and ninety nine dollars
again for the base model and that comes
with a higher capacity SSD at 256
gigabytes so not too bad in Australia a
bit too expensive I think in the United
States but you definitely get a very
high quality laptop and it's been one of
my favorite devices to review as far as
ultra portables are concerned the past
couple of years it's truly an excellent
device and that's it for this review of
