looking at graphics cards once again
unfortunately it's not new graphics
cards we know you guys are super keen to
hear what's happening with those but we
really don't have any idea at this point
instead we're exploring cards you can
actually buy right now which ones are
the best value for money and whether you
should even buy one at all right now at
this point you're probably familiar with
the story of graphics card pricing early
in 2017 things were going nicely - the
graphics card market you could find most
cards in stock and the price is near the
MSRP
but then as cryptocurrency mining
started to boom in the later parts of
2017 and especially in early 2018 prices
for cards started to soar as eager
miners bought them in droves the market
was also affected by increasing memory
prices graphics card manufacturers have
been forced to spend more money to get
the gddr5 and HBM modules used with most
GPUs and that's led to an increase in
the price of manufacturing these cards
which of course is then passed on to the
consumer if you're looking for someone
to blame for that one send your anger
emails to Samsung micron and SK Hynix
the combination of those two factors
made buying a graphics current absolute
nightmare at the end of 2017 and the
start of this year there was a point
around January the CUA you'd be lucky to
find a GPU in stock and if you did
you're faced with prices more than
double the MSRP in some cases
luckily midway through March or so the
profitability of mining on consumer GPUs
dropped away and the stock started to
return to the market apparently too much
stock at least if you believe some
recent reports suggesting Nvidia
over-ordered GPUs to the tune of 300,000
units when we last looked at GPU pricing
in May prices of popular graphics cards
had dropped significantly since the
heights of January and there was a clear
trajectory suggesting the market will
return to near MSRP levels in just a few
months well it's now the middle of July
and in some ways the GPU market is now
looking pretty good for prospective
buyers looking at the current lineup of
nvidia geforce cards so you can see the
pricing trend pretty clearly the current
number one graphics card the gtx 1066
gigabyte was priced as high as five
hundred and thirty dollars in january
more than double its two
$50.00 MSRP that came down to $330 in
May and now they irregularly found for
300 bucks or so when looking at typical
pricing across a range of retailers
while the cheapest carts haven't hit
MSRP just yet prices are certainly
dropping it's even better news for
invidious higher-end products the gtx
1070 was up over $800 in january and
dropped to just 500 $20 in May but these
days you can find plenty available for
less than four hundred and fifty dollars
and the cheapest models are available at
just twenty dollars more than the cards
MSRP of 380 it's even better news for
the gtx 1070 TI and gtx 1080 which can
actually now be found at the MSRP one of
the cards didn't drop in price at all
that much from January to may was the
gtx 1080 TI last time we checked the
card was still more than two hundred
dollars above the MSRP well today that
gap has shrunk massively to the point
where the cheapest 1080 t eyes are just
twenty dollars above the MSRP switching
over to AMD cards it's a similar story
the RX 5 70 + RX 580 in particular were
massively inflated in January costing
more than triple the MSRP and even in
May those cards were still well above
the MSRP we're still not seeing MSRP
like prices today and I doubt we have a
will but both models can now be found
below $300 which was fairly difficult a
couple of months ago vega 56 and vega 64
cards are more readily available now and
in fact this is probably the only time
since their vote you in the middle of
2017 that has actually been possible to
buy these cards easily we're still
looking at prices $80 above the MSRP but
both use HBM - and the price of buying
HBM - chips has increased significantly
since launch so that kind of makes sense
looking at price drop since January and
a lot of cards have received a 40 to 50
percent price cut particularly in the
high end it's only really the lower end
cards like the GTX 1050 Ti and rx 550
that is still inflated though again
memory prices are to blame as a much
higher percentage of the manufacturing
cost for these cards now lies with the
memory modules compared to just two
months ago most cards have come down in
price by at least nine percent if not
more and that's over a pretty short
amount of time things are settling back
down to normal but we're still not quite
at MSRP for most cards in
top end cards are at or close to the
MSRP in the best-case scenarios though
they're lower and cars are a billion
flatted ambhi's lineup is still at least
15% above the MSRP though like with
invidious mid-range and entry-level
cards I can't see the price of these
cards coming down too much more due to
the higher cost of gddr5 and HB m2
compared to launch now comes the
all-important look into what cards are
actually the best value right now in May
the GTX 1063 gigabyte was the best value
card on the market with in video winning
all the key battles from price to
performance ratio the gtx 1066 gigabyte
was just slightly better value than the
rx 580 while the gtx 1070 and GT X 1080
was significantly better value than the
vague of 56 and Vegas 64 respectively in
July things are a bit different thanks
to larger price drops in the AMD side
we're looking at a 6-game cost per frame
average recording the 1% low performance
at 1440p and using the same games as the
main analysis we see some movement in
the value charts in this small selection
of GPUs the i-x 588 gigabyte has taken
the crown from the GTX 1066 gigabyte it
was a slim went to the 1060 last time
but a 14% price drop to the AMD card
compared to just 9 percent the Nvidia
offering has swung things in AMD's favor
either card is a great option but the
wind does go to the RX 580 here narrowly
the Battle of upper end cards has
tightened significantly Vega 56 is now
on par and even slightly ahead of the
gtx 1070 TI which is its nearest price
and performance competitor in may it was
a slam-dunk victory to the 1070 TI but
the market is now much more competitive
that said the faster GTX 1080 is
slightly better value for around $50
more while the gtx 1070 is the best of
this bunch at the higher it's still a
win for a video with the GT X 1080
providing notably better value than Vega
56 and while the GTX 1080 Ti is the
worst value of the lot it's in a
performance class of its own
using a two-game average with our wider
selection of cards we can see where the
other contenders fit in the GTX 1063
gigabyte used to be far and away the
best value card but as it hasn't
received a price cut since May the RX
580 has screamed back into contention
offering just as much value considering
it's also better than
GTX 1066 gigabyte in terms of value is
slightly cheaper than that card in
actual dollar values and is faster than
the 10 63 gigabyte I'd give the overall
crown for the best value card to the RX
580 at this point in time the lower
mid-range cards like the rx 560 RX v 7e
and GT x 1050 TI are all similar value
right now though I think they're a bit
overpriced considering what you get the
rx 550 is still bizarrely terrible value
while the upper end cards fall into the
same positions as in our six-game
average so with a further two months of
graphics cards coming down in price AMD
has become much more competitive to the
point where the rx 588 gigabyte is the
best value card out there taking the
crown from Nvidia I'd still recommend
the gtx 1070 as an upper mid-range
option over veda 56 and the 1070 TI in
that order and at the top the gtx 1080
is still a much better buy than vegas 64
for those after a cheaper card it's a
tight battle but would go for the RX 5
60 16 cu over the gtx 1050 TI although
the 1050 Ti has become much more
competitive in the last two months
those are our recommendations for the
best value graphics cards you can buy
right now but that doesn't answer the
question of whether you should actually
buy one right now
or wait for next generation offering us
to hit the market there have been so
many rumors about next-gen cards from
Nvidia in particular pulling to a relay
sometime this year that understandably
many of you who want to wait a bit
longer instead we originally thought in
video might unveil those cards at the
end of July but with alleged stock
issues with current cards it sounds like
that's been delayed and well I guess who
really knows what the situation is at
this point in any case it doesn't sound
like new GPUs will launch for at least
another few months and then at launch
who knows what the status of
availability will be and what sort of
product segments will be actually
covered in the first wave for that
reason if you've been waiting to buy a
current gen graphics card you should
probably just pull the trigger at this
point because prices are now the best
they've been for over a year I think it
makes sense to buy now particularly if
you're interested in a mid-range card or
lower like the rx 5 radio GTX 1060
because it's unlikely those products
will be superseded with the first wave
of NVIDIA GPUs because we're so near the
MSRP with the prices of a lot of these
cards and with memory prices continuing
to
stay quite high it's unlikely the cards
will get significantly cheaper and
that's another good reason by now could
be a good option I'd be a bit more
hesitant to buy now if I was after a
high-end card like the GTX 1080 or
better those products are more likely to
be superseded soon so it could be worth
waiting a bit longer to see what
next-gen products we have in store and
let's be honest at this point in the
release cycle is one or even two year
old graphics cards from AMD and NVIDIA
should be well under their launch price
so even though we're recommending a few
different options here and talked about
how nice it is to have pricing come back
down to MSRP levels it's still super
disappointing to see how expensive those
old products are hopefully by the end of
the year there'll be a bit more life in
the stagnant graphics card market that's
it for this one if you're interested in
