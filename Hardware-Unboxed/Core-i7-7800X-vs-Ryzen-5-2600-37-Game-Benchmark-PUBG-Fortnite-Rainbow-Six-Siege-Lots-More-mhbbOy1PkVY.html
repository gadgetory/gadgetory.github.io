you I have another in-depth gaming
benchmark comparison this time between
the risin 5 2600 and the core i7 7800 X
now I did recently compare these two
processes or a very similar version it
was the 2600 X and the 700 X anyway I
compared those you know sort of an IPC
type benchmark where both CPUs will lock
4 gigahertz using the same memory spec
and I found it for the gaming
performance that it was actually quite
mixed between these two processes though
more often than not I would say rise and
did come out on top given those somewhat
interesting results I've decided to add
these 7800 X to the results gathered in
the past few weeks comparing the risin 5
2600 and core i5 8400 I of course drops
the 8400 to make way for the 700 X which
has been tested in a stock and overclock
configuration before we get into the
nitty-gritty of it though I would like
to just thank Nord VPN for sponsoring
this massive benchmark video right now
Nord VPNs offering my viewers 77% of a
three-year membership when used the link
in the video description I really like
Nord VPNs no data logging policy and
because of this I actually use them to
keep my data safe on my phone laptop and
of course my desktop PC I do highly
recommend you check them out if you're
at all concerned about internet security
if you're unfamiliar with what a VPN is
it stands for virtual private network
and it does exactly what it sounds like
it keeps you and your data private by
connecting remotely without having to
show your IP or any private information
and more than that it encrypts the data
you're sending and receiving this is
particularly useful when using Wi-Fi at
a hotel for example you never know who's
looking at your information so stop them
by encrypting your data with Nord VPN
Nord VPN uses military-grade encryption
and they have more than 4000 super fast
servers in 62 countries across the globe
and that number continues to grow on a
weekly basis nor VPN also offers up to
six simultaneous connections and 24/7
customer support via live chat and email
they also offer a risk 3 30-day
money-back guarantee so start protecting
your internet experience they were 77%
off a three-year plan by using code
harbour unboxed at Nord VPN
komm /r unboxed or use the link in the
video description okay so here's a few
quick notes on the test setup before we
jump into the results the core i7 7800 X
has been tested using the stock Intel
spec which only calls for ddr4 2400
memory in a quad channel configuration
since there's no box cooler I've used an
open-loop system on the Praxis wet bench
and the motherboard of choice is the
gigabyte x2 9 horas gaming 7 pro the
same setup has been used to cool the
overclock configuration which sees all
cores operating at 4.6 q coats with ddr4
3400 memory with tweaked sub timings and
the mesh ratio has been increased to 32
times the vehicle load line calibration
has been set to turbo and the internal
CPU vehicle has been set to 1.25 volt
with an external override voltage this
is the total voltage going into the CPU
set to one point nine volt then for the
risin five 2600 there soos ROG crosshair
seven hero was used but the same
performance can be achieved with a
budget x4 70 board or even a be 350
board for that matter anyway two
configurations have again been tested a
stock out of the box configuration using
the g.skill flare xcl 14 memory clocked
at 29 33 and for this configuration the
CPU is cooled using the rate stealth box
cooler then we have a 4.2 gigahertz or
core overclock using aggressively tuned
g.skill sniper X ddr4 3400 memory with
Titan sub timings and the cooler has
been upgraded to the course at H 115 I
pro but again I should note that you can
achieve this overclock with a basic air
cooler then finally we have 37 games on
the menu each of which has been tested
at 720p 1080p and 1440p using the
GeForce GTX 280 I last time I did forget
Rainbow six siege so ivory added that to
the long list of games I'm testing with
so let's get into it
getting the benchmarking session started
is Ark survival evolved and here things
look very competitive overclocking the
risin 5 2600 offers no real performance
advantage in this title and for the most
part the same is true for these 7800 X a
small gain for the core i7 processor can
be seen at 720p but beyond that we are
mostly GPU bound
ok so previously when comparing the
risin 5 2600 to the core i5 8400 and
ARMA 3
I found that stop they both do
virtually identical performance that
being the case I found these results
quite shocking but having rechecked to
the settings and then the benchmark
results themselves I can confirm this
isn't the case for the core i7 17 800 X
even overclocked the centre header X
struggles to match the stock horizon 520
600 which admittedly doesn't seem right
I'm not sure why the Scarlet X processor
is so slow in this title
even at 4.6 gigahertz with ddr4 3,200
memory and these results are intriguing
and I'll continue to look into them it
would be great to get some feedback from
any sky like X owners out there that
happen to play ARMA 3 moving on we have
ashes of the singularity and here the
core i7 700 X was clearly fast in the
risin 5 process we're testing at 720p
under stock conditions the 7800 X was 7%
faster on average and once both CPUs
were overclocked that margin grew to 12%
though the Intel CPU was just 6% faster
for the frame time result as we moved to
tear DP things start to become mostly
GPU bound and here Intel was never more
than 5% faster and that margin
structured is 4 percent or less at 1440p
like the core i5 8400 tested previously
the 700 X easily beats the Rison 5 2600
and Assassin's Creed origins and this is
particularly evident at 720p as the GPU
isn't limiting performance as heavily
here as we move to 10 DP the margins
close up dramatically and then at 1440p
the same experience is had with either
CPU battlefield 1 throws up some mixed
results starting at 720p we see that the
2600 was faster out of the box with 9%
more frames on average though the frame
time performance was much closer however
once overclocked the 700 X is now up to
5% faster and we see similar performance
trends at turn EP as well it's not until
the 1440p resolution is reached that the
margins really close up and although the
overclocked i5 2600 was a few frames
faster these results are within the
margin of error
ok so I've had a heap of fun with Star
Wars Battlefront 2 over the past few
days and that is indeed sarcasm in the
previous Rison 5 2600 vs. Core i5 8400
comparison the rise in CPU got whipped
for the stock configuration and I
couldn't work out why it was so slow at
the time I did take the time to retest
multiple times and
the exact same results but even so I
knew they didn't make sense especially
given that the overclock configuration
was up to 40 percent faster and I
mentioned at the time that the results
didn't make sense when testing these
7800 X I saw great performance at 720p
but then the framerate dropped right
down at 1080p to the same level of
performance seen at 1440p and this made
no sense either at this point I knew
something was wrong with the game I just
didn't know what so I began to
investigate for this I switch back over
to the AMD arisin test system and
started to mess around over and over
again I'll sing around 110 to 120 fps at
720p and it wasn't until I alt tabbed to
the Windows desktop to check out a few
things and then load back into the game
that I noticed something quite odd
jumping back into the game the framerate
was now boosted by at least 30% to
around 160 fps
now this wasn't a one-off situation
either this was repeatable over and over
again when using both AMD and Intel
hardware and after the alt-tab I was
seen the kind of performance margins
you'd expect to see however making the
issue a little more confusing to
diagnose especially when I was
benchmarking originally the bug doesn't
always seem to be present sometimes when
you load into the game you do get
maximum performance while other times
you see that large drop in performance
and this bug isn't just affecting me
either Tim was able to replicate my
findings on his own test systems and we
were also called on our patreon members
to help investigate as well and they
found the exact same bug with the low
resolution testing so apologies for the
misinformation regarding the battlefront
two numbers in the previous video I will
update those results and include them in
a pinned comment below
I should have dropped the title from a
list of games tested until I'd worked
out what the issue was but part of me
didn't want to drop a game just because
AMD was seen to be doing poorly in it
but in hindsight I was wrong to include
those results again very sorry about the
mistake but I am glad we were able to
work out the issue by using this
workaround to avoid the performance bug
here is how the 7800 X and 2600 stack up
this time we see at 720p that the
overclocked arising configuration was
21% faster and we see a 29% boost for
these 7800 X out of the box the 700 X
was able to provide a similar average
for
right with a stronger 1% low result then
with both CPUs overclocked the 7800 X
was up to 8% faster this margin is
heavily reduced at 1080p and 1440p as
performance is now GPU limited at least
we're looking at the overclocked results
moving on we have csgo and some more
mixture results and to me at least the
1440p results don't make any sense that
being the case I went back and retested
twice to try and work out what was going
on here
this didn't help me understand the
results any better but I was able to
further validate them so at least that's
something
although the semi 100x smashes the 2600
for the average framerate at 720p and
1080p it mysteriously drops down to 464
FPS at 1440p and that's not much faster
than the stock configuration normally
I'd say this is due to GPU limitations
but that's clearly not the case as the
2600 pushed the GTX 280 out of 529 FPS
and the core i5 8400 was good for around
500 FPS as well it's also interesting to
note that the 2600 was up to 27 percent
faster than the 7800 x4 the frame time
performance even at 1440p very strange
results indeed but I can assure you they
are accurate Deus Ex mankind divided
provides some very competitive results
here the semi 100x was never more than a
few percent faster and for the most part
we saw comparable performance
overclocking proved somewhat beneficial
at 1080p with the GTX 280 I but even
this mighty GPU couldn't justify the
overclock at 1440p dirt 4 is a risin
friendly title and it shows at 720p the
2600 was up to 13 percent faster than
semi 100x once both CPUs were
overclocked that's an impressive result
given the Rison 5 processor is clocked
to 9 percent or lower the 2600
maintained a lead at 1080p and
interestingly still offered much better
frame ton performance once overclocked
at 1440p moving on to f1 2017 here we
see the horizon 5 packin a serious punch
out of the box as it delivered 12
percent more frames an average when
compared to the 7800 X that said with
both CPU is overclocked the performance
was much the same at all 3 tested
resolutions still out of the box the
2600 was much more punchy in this title
the far cry 5 results are also quite
mixed and very interesting
the box the 2600 did dominate at 720p
and 1080p but then at 1440p well the
average frame rate was much higher we
saw a slightly lower frame time result
granted it was within the margin of
error but it is strange that I only
matched the 7800 X here then when
overclocked we see at the 7800 X really
catches up and even surpasses the 2600
for the average framerate but it was
much slower when comparing the 1% low
results at all resolutions tested Far
Cry primal is an odd title and here we
see that it is primarily CPU bound and
out of the box the 2600 wipes the floor
with the 70 100x but once both CPUs are
overclocked the performance is much the
same and we see them limiting the GTX
1080i to around 88 to 90 fps firaon is
not at all heavy on the CPU and these
are primarily GPU bound title and we see
this with the 2600 and 700 X which are
able to get the most out the GTX 1080i
that said the risin 5 processor did at
times deliver better frame time
performance now just quickly please note
that these fortnight numbers aren't
comparable with the results from the
8400 versus 2600 benchmark as I've had
to use an updated replay doodle recent
game patch this new pass is a little
more CPU demanding it seems I ran into a
few more players at once this time
around anyway there isin 5 2600 still
does very well out of the box and it
crushes the 7 100x at all three
resolutions even at 1440p it was still
up to 18 percent faster overclocked the
2600 still enjoys commanding leads at
720p and 1080p very by the time we hit
1440p both CPUs GPU limited still
overall an exceptional result for AMD in
this title using the stock hardware
settings the Rison 5 2600 delivered a
much better frame time result when
testing with frost Punk and this was
true for all three resolutions of course
the 2600 is paired with memory clocked
22% higher but the Intel spec only calls
for 2400 memory so take that up with
Intel anyway once overclocked both were
able to max out the gtx 1080i so nothing
really in it here moving on to grand
theft auto 5 and here the Rison 5 2600
does very well both stock and
overclocked using the stock settings the
2600 crushed the semi 100x and even once
overclocked the 700
take a similar beating although the
frame time performance was comparable at
1440p the average frame rate was still
9% higher with the 2600 moving on the
Hitman we see that the stock settings
saw these 7800 X and 2600 deliver
similar performance and thus every hour
X was a few frames faster for the
average while the 2600 was ahead for the
frame time result though both were
within or extremely close to the margin
of error overclocking did favor Intel
this time around
and now the semi 100x was up to 10
percent faster and this extremely CPU
bound title Just Cause 3 provides what
are probably the most competitive
results we've seen so far
basically the 700 X and 2600 deliver the
same performance when stock and then the
same performance once overclocked
although in an unlikely scenario for a
CPU limited title it was bound to happen
sooner or later
Kingdom Come deliverance is up next and
the 70 odd heretics struggled to keep
pace with the 2600 in this title
even when overclocked it still lagged
behind until we ran into the GPU limited
1440p results this is a poorly optimized
total in my opinion but even so it did
play quite well in the 2600 Mass Effect
Andromeda provided very competitive
results and we see a bit of back and
forth between the two CPUs overall
though before us was much the same so
there's really no clear winner here next
up we have the overwatch bot match and
here the 2600 offered better frame time
performance out of the box however once
both CPUs were overclocked they maxed
out the GTX 1082 I deliver the same GPU
limited performance here we can see when
testing with pray that the 2600 has the
1700 X's number out of the box 720p and
1080p as we often find by the time we
hit 1440p though we do reach a GPU limit
so there's really no chance for either
CPU to make a note where the difference
here
then once overclocked both CPUs deliver
comparable performance even at the low
resolutions
Intel's Core i7 7800 X struggles and
project curves - and here the horizon 5
processor was faster both stock and
overclocked even at 1440 pay the 2600
was up to 11% faster when stock and
still 6% faster with both CPUs
overclocked
I'd say the lower frequency ddr4 memory
really kills us every 100x in pub G and
we see that once paired with ddr4 3400
memory and
clocked it was able to add your head of
the 2600 our overall competitive
performance as you might have expected
when overclocked the performance is
limited at 1440p by the GPU Intel enjoys
the performance advantage in quake
champions we're not GPU limited at 720p
and 1080p there at no point did it enjoy
double-digit gains with frame rates well
over 100 FPS at all times both CPUs led
for very player performance but at the
lower resolutions the semi 100x was able
to push a little harder okay so very
sorry I forgot to include Rainbow six
siege last time out the good news is I
didn't make the same mistake twice
so let's go over the results we're
mostly GPU limited at 1080p and 1440p so
let's focus on the 720p numbers here we
were a CPU limited for these stock
results but once overclocked the 2600
was able to push the GTX 1080i a little
harder allowing for up to 5% more
performance not a big win by any means
but the rise and 5 processor was
consistently faster
although shadow of what is a mostly GPU
bound title we did see stronger
framerate performance from the 2600 at
720p and TP so solid performance from
AMD 6 core CPU here but overall we were
GPU limited so both process has
delivered similar results next up we
have Sniper Elite 4 and healer Aizen 5
2600 was up to 13% faster out of the box
and quite shockingly remained 12% faster
for the frame time performance at 720p
once both CPUs were overclocked even at
the more GPU limited 1440p resolution
the 2600 maintained noticeably stronger
frame time performance and when
overclocked was still 10% faster to my
surprise when testing with Starcraft 2
for the first time in a long time in the
previous video comparing the 8400 and
2600 I found the rise in 526 hundred to
be very impressive in this title here we
see that it again stacks up very well
this sum against the 7800 X and offers
greater performance out of the box and
once overclocked
moving on we have the division and this
title almost always provides us with GPU
limited results we're testing with
mid-range to high-end CPUs here we see
that overclocking the 2600 offer little
to no benefit as the gtx 1080i
is pushed to the max by the stock rising
processor the stock 700 X isn't able to
maximize the GTX 1080 eyes performance
even at 14
pay which is quite shocking that said
the ddr4 2400 memory is likely limiting
performance here overclock though the
700 X gets up to speed and is now to
match the 2600 when testing the core i5
8400 previously we saw really weak frame
time before it's when compared to the
2600 and we again see that when testing
the 700 X although the average framerate
is much the same the frame time
performance is well down until we hit
the GPU limited 1440p results that the
7800 X is able to catch up I'll just
quickly touch on the titanfall 2
performance as we are 100% GPU limited
in this game and then at 720p and 1080p
we run into a 144 FPS frame cap which at
least to my knowledge still can't be
removed so that being the case there's
not really much to report here so let's
move right along to vermintide - a
recently released title that plays
exceptionally well with the horizon
processes both stock and overclocked
both stock and overclocked the 2600
dominates the 7rx in this title
consistently delivering stronger frame
time and average framerate performance
this is a seriously good result family
and I wonder if we're going to start
seeing more and more new titles
delivering these kinds of results moving
on to total war Warhammer 2 and here
it's worth noting that the overclocked
700 X is only able to deliver
performance that's similar to this stock
Core i5 8400 as a result the 2600 was
faster both out of the box and
overclocked it's not until we hit the
GPU limited 1440p resolution that 700 X
is able to match the 2600 watchdogs 2 is
a very CPU intensive title but given
that it predates the release of Verizon
is better optimized for Intel hardware
and we see the result of that here even
out of the box the 700 X was superior
and extends its lead at 720p and 1080p
once overclocked even at 1440p the 700 X
beats out the 2600 so not a great
showing from AMD here the second last
game tested is Ghost Recon wildlands and
here we see a mostly GPU limited
scenario particularly at 1080p and 1440p
dropping down to 720p
does allow for some separation and once
overclock the 700 X is the more powerful
CPU on this title though of course under
most normal conditions this difference
might be realized finally we have World
of Tanks and here
find some very competitive performance
both stock and overclocked these are CPU
limited results and despite that both
the 2600 and semi 100x are very evenly
matched okay so if you made it this far
well done we've now looked at how the
core i7 CRX and risin 520 600 compare in
37 games both stock and overclocked at
three resolutions to make summarizing
these results a bit easier here's the
average performance across all the games
tested as you might have expected the
overall picture looks quite even at 720p
the rise in v 2600 was up to 9% faster
out of the box but the default Intel and
AMD memory specs say the 2600 pair of
ddr4 memory clocked 22% higher so a big
advantage to AMD there once both CPUs
are overclocked to a realistic maximum
frequency with fine screen memory sub
timings and the mesh overclocked for the
700 X we find very similar performance
the frame time result was a few percent
better with the 2600 but the average
frame rate was a few percent higher with
the similar X so again pretty similar
performance those margins are also seen
at 1080p there at 1440p the rise of 520
600 did a little better overall with
stronger frame time performance still
though there wasn't a great deal in it
sorry there you have it in terms of
gaming performance the Rison 5 2600 and
core i7 7800 X are very similar once
both CPUs are fine-tuned for maximum
performance I imagine if we bumped up
the stock configuration for the 7800 X
up to ddr4 29:33 we would see identical
performance out of the box as well but
by doing that we are technically
overclocking the memory in any case both
CPUs are able to deliver exceptional
gaming performance so you might be
wondering why I haven't mitad - not
liking the core i7 70 our X in the past
most recently in my top 5 worst CPUs
video to be clear the 7800 X isn't a bad
CPU as you've just seen performance when
overclocked is excellent the issue is
the price the 700 X comes in at an MSRP
of 390 dollars u.s. making it more
expensive than the much faster core i7
8700 K and significantly more expensive
than the $190 u.s. Rison 520 600
essentially what this means is that the
2600 is offering the same level
of gaming performance for half the price
it gets even worse when you factor in
the platform cost the cheapest X $2.99
boards are priced $200 us while the X
470 boards start at 140 dollars u.s.
though it is possible to achieve a
similar level of performance on an ultra
affordable $80.00 USB 350 board you also
need to purchase twice as many ddr4
memory modules if you want to take
advantage of the 70 100 X's quad-channel
memory support the 70 X also requires
some seriously beefy cooling at 4.6
gigahertz whereas the 2600 is good with
a basic air cooler for our 4.2 you Hertz
overclock so and their very least you're
looking at having to spend 80% more on
the 700 X and X 2 9 combo opposed to the
2600 and X 470 combo how you could buy
to Rison 526 hundred protesters and to
be 350 motherboards for the price of a
single 17 her X processor and board this
right here is why I don't like the
Scarlett X series it has nothing to do
with the CPUs being bad because they're
anything but again what's bad here is
Intel's insane prices
I'd say the days of massive profit
margins for Intel are coming to an end
for example we're surely going to see
fewer and fewer end-users coughing up an
80% premium for the core i 9 79 6 DX
over the incoming thread ripper 29 50 X
when they deliver the same level of
performance anyway I'm not hiding on
Intel here I'm merely noting that we
have some serious competition in the CPU
space now and Intel really does need to
react to that by lowering the prices of
their high-end desktop parts of course
they won't feel the need to reduce
prices until they see a decline in sales
but that's surely going to happen is AMD
continues to become more and more
competitive with each release finally
