at this time last week I put together
the smallest gaming PC I've ever built
using this sleek looking in win Chopin
overall it was an awesome little PC
featuring the arisin 520 400 G which
allows for respectable performance
eternity P in competitive titles such as
overwatch and fortnight for example the
2400 G is an unlocked part and users are
free to overclock not just the CPU but
also the GPU and this can boost gaming
performance by around 10% for that
particular model not a shattering gains
but French we level Hardware every bit
helps
aim DS box cooler the Wraith stealth
allows things to get a little too toasty
when overclocking so I picked up the
crying C server instead and just assumed
that that would be better
I wasn't assuming that it would be a
significant improvement over the Box
cooler but enough to allow for a decent
overclock sadly though the c7 allowed
the 2400 G to get quite hot and I was
surprised by how loud it was it was
really quite ridiculous and it seemed
much louder than the box cooler and I
wasn't convinced the temperatures were
really all that improved so I decided to
investigate having reported the
operating temperatures with the c7 as
well as recording the operating volume I
swapped it out for the Wraith stealth
now to fit the box call it into the
Chopin you need to remove the plastic
shroud on the top of the fan so not the
fan shroud just the little decorative
piece on the top with the AMD branding
behind the AMD branding and two small
screws remove those and then the
decorative plastic bitches clips off
it's pretty quick and easy to remove and
doing so won't impact performance in any
way the wraith stealth now fits
perfectly snug inside of the chopin now
just a quick recap the cryo reg c7
allows for a peak operating temperature
of 57 degrees in f1 2017 which is
actually quite good really that said we
did see temperatures hit 78 degrees when
running our blender workload although
that's an acceptable temperature it
doesn't really allow much Headroom or
really any Headroom for overclocking for
reference previously when using the deep
cooled gamax 200t we were able to keep
the temperatures under 70 degrees at all
times with the APU overclocked
max so I was pretty disappointed with
the c-7 last week when I tested it for
this bill for the first time however now
that I've gone and tested the Wraith
stealth box cooler under the same
conditions I've adjusted my opinion well
kind of writing f1 2017 again with the
Wraith stealth we now see the
temperature peak at 61 degrees which is
four degrees warmer than that of the c7
so it's not a huge difference but more
than that one to two degrees I had in
mind however it's the blender test where
temps really creep up and here the
Wraith stealth will add the 2400 GT 86
degrees and that's 8 degrees hotter than
the c7 and well that's obviously quite
significant that said there's also the
issue of the operating volume and as I
noted earlier the c7 seemed a lot louder
and I noted that in last week's video as
well turns out I wasn't imagining this
here's some unaltered audio samples of
how loud the Chopin is using each cooler
please note the mic was positioned
exactly 3 feet from the PC and the fan
was directly facing the mic also for
best results it's probably worth putting
on some headphones
so as I thought the cryo rig c-7 is much
louder than the Wraith stealth box
cooler even at idle the results are
surprising and this is really probably
what shocked me most about the c7
whereas the race style is virtually
silent at idle you can clearly hear the
c7 then when gaming the box cooler can
still be heard but it really isn't that
annoying of a c7 though it is
significantly louder and it generates a
very annoying high-pitched sound then
for our blender workload the Reef
stealth maxes out at around 2,000 rpm
and with a fan spinning this fast you
can clearly hear it but it's not really
annoyingly loud in my opinion the c7
though that is now spinning at 2700 rpm
and it's significantly louder than the
Box cooler and for me it's just
unacceptable loud personally I wouldn't
want to be living with this thing so
although the c7 reduced to 2400 G's
operating temperature by 8 degrees I'm
running our blender workload the
increased operating volume really isn't
worth the headache in my opinion not
only that but with a higher rpm fan
you'd know how to achieve the same
results with the Wraith stealth anyway a
likewise your group probably limit the
c7s fan speed but then what's the point
of spending $30 u.s. or 50 dollars
Australian on a cool of it it's really
no better than what came bundled with
the CPU for free in conclusion though
the c7 really isn't as bad as I thought
it was this time last week at the time I
was assuming thermal performance pretty
much the same as the race stealth which
is obviously a bad thing given it makes
a lot more noise truth is though it is
better than that but overall still not
really that much better than the Wraith
stealth Box cooler because when you
account for the extra volume there extra
thermal performance really it's kind of
offset by that so Raven Ridge apu owners
really stand to gain nothing by
investing in the c7 and given that
increases of the total cost of the 2400
G by almost 20% I'd recommend you keep
your money and well that's going to do
