of hub builder this is the episode we've
been talking about for ages now when
we've been unboxing all the various
things in our unboxing series but we
finally have all the parts for that
$1,200 1440p you build if you missed the
unboxing or unveiling of all these boxes
then go back and check out the unboxing
series it was a lot of fun but we
finally have all the boxes here with
hopefully all the hardware inside so we
can build that awesome system if you'd
like a bit more information on why we
picked these various things such as the
GTX that's the wrong box that's the GTX
10 50 bucks
hey in one moment we're right that's
better I only just got this thing
yesterday
no not yesterday you're probably
watching this on Thursday I only got
this thing earlier in the week and I
already lost it under all the other
boxes we have laying around the office
anyway we now have the rewind if you
want to find out the reasons why we
picked various bits of hardware such as
the gtx 1070 or the asrock motherboard
g.skill memory the crucial SSD and so on
and so forth all this cool Coolermaster
gear then go back and check out the
parts picker guide on this build I'll
put the link in the description so as I
just mentioned this is a $1,200 u.s.
1440p gaming rig but if you're a
kangaroo riding Ozzy like me then you
can expect to pay about $1,900 right so
first up I'm going to show you guys a
time-lapse style video of the build
going together so you can see all these
awesome components coming together to
create what should be the ultimate 1440p
gaming rig once built I'll connect up a
monitor I get a keyboard mouse and we'll
play some games I'll show you the games
being played on the system but I'll also
report some benchmark data or framerate
results and that's really pretty cool so
with that let's get to it
well that came together quite nicely
it's worth noting that I didn't add
anything extra to the bill so there's no
extra case fans you just get the
standard 120 millimeter in the front 120
millimeter in the rear no fancy braided
cables or anything like that I was
tempted to tart it up a bit with some
LED lighting which would have made this
look pretty spectacular but bit
misleading because that isn't how it
would look unless you went and purchased
those separately so pretty much this is
what you could build with the components
we were given right so now let's connect
up the monitor keyboard mouse and get
gaming
he used to make good fun here till all
the great guns shake
solid copy move into the building the
access route you need to block us at the
far end of the penthouses and keep in
mind the direct route might not be the
easiest one Raja met
MacCready will advise once each team is
on the ground out
with the latest and greatest PC gaming
hardware on hand I'm often sweat for
choice that said if you told me I had to
spend the next year or two gaming on
this rig I don't think I'd be too upset
about that in my opinion even on
monitors like the 32 inch Philips screen
used for testing 1440p looks great and I
don't find an overwhelmingly strong urge
to go 4k of course I'm not trying to
suggest you guys that this is a budget
system by any means it's not it's a
$1200 u.s. system or $1,900 Aussie and
that's a it's a fair chunk of change but
my point is I often game on extreme
systems and I don't feel like I'm giving
up anything with this sensible 1440p
build anyway as we said in our parts
pick a guide for this build these specs
will make for a very drool-worthy PC
capable of delivering very playable
1440p performance in all the latest
titles and well we just got an example
of that or a few good examples they're
only potential upgrade options here
include a core i7 6700k
or a geforce gtx 1080 also the cool
thing about this build is that you could
if you wanted to go to a core i7 wait
till later next year and get a cab you
like core i7 processor and you could
even wait till Nvidia or AMD released
their upcoming high-end GPUs and get one
of them as a potential upgrade down the
track so there's there is plenty of
options available overall we really love
this system we'd like to take a moment
to thank all the companies involved in
this build
big thanks to coolermaster g.skill
gigabyte crucial and Western Digital
with that I'm going to get out of here
and hand it over to you guys
smash that like button come on you know
your water and as always feel free to
drop us some comments below we love
hearing from you guys I'm your host
Steve catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
