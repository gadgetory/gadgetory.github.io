been six months since intel released
their eighth gen core series so we're
probably ready to move on to a new
series that will use the same socket but
it won't be backwards compatible
actually no wait that is wrong today
we're finally testing out some budget
motherboards for existing 8th gen core
series processors budget motherboards
that don't support any kind of
overclocking and ever less we're super
excited to test them out because we were
waiting for these or what seems like
forever just quickly for those of you
who are subscribed to the channel and
have been missing some of our content
YouTube recently changed the way things
work and some people had the little bail
thing the little bail notification D
selected so if you are subscribed and
you want to be notified of new content
when it becomes available hit the bell
and that should put you off the chance
fingers crossed anyway that said thanks
for watching and supporting our work now
it's time to get back to the topic at
hand
normally with intel or AMD for that
matter release a new mainstream desktop
processor series they do so with a slew
of new chipsets for example the 7th gen
core series codenamed kb lake hit the
ground running with 5 supporting
chipsets and three of them you're
probably quite familiar with as another
example AMD also released rising with
three desktop chipsets the a320 be 350
and X 370 but when Intel raced out the
8th gen core series codenamed coffee
like last year they did so with just a
single chipset the high-end expensive
Zed 370 version this meant up until
today the cheapest Intel 300 series
motherboard you get your hands on cost
around 110 dollars u.s. now today some
six months since the initial release
Intel's finally ready to unleash their
more budget-friendly chipsets which
includes the B 360 I also have some H
370 boards on hand but we're focusing on
this slightly more affordable B 360
boards today so when compared to the Z
370 boards we already have what's
missing from these cheaper B 360 boards
well for starters B 360 boards don't
supports CPU or memory overclocking even
with an unlocked K processor this means
auto overclocking features such as
multi-core enhancement don't exist
either they also don't support raid
configurations they offer fewer PCIe
lanes to the CPU less USB ports though
the B 360 chipset does introduce native
USB 3.1 gen2 ports something the said
370 chipset lacks entirely then finally
whereas the said 370 boards can support
up to three m2 ports the B 360 boards
are limited to a single port as I noted
earlier the B 360 chipset doesn't
support ddr4 memory overclocking and as
such is limited to the maximum frequency
supported by the integrated memory
controller this means the core i7 and
core i5 models can run it up to ddr4
2666 while the core i3 models are
limited to ddr4 2400 B 360 boards do
support XMP but if you were to use
modules with a ddr4 3000 profile for
example then when you loaded that
profile it would only load the timings
associated with that profile and then
set the memory to 20 666 or 2,400
depending on the CPU used MSI has kindly
provided us with two of their newbie 360
models for testing and they say that
through their own internal testing
they've seen no difference in
performance between B 360 and Zi 370
motherboards when testing out of the
same conditions of course they are
basing this claim on testing done with
their most high-end model the gaming Pro
carbon using the core i7 8700 K I
personally though was interested in
testing more affordable models so I
requested the B 360 gaming plus and the
dinky little B 360 m Pro VD which
forgoes verum cooling entirely now if
you missed my last video where I looked
into the core i7 8700 performance using
the Intel Box cooler it might be worth
going back and watching that video first
I'll provide a link in the video
description but in short leading up to
the release of these budget 300 series
chipsets there were concerns that these
six core parts wouldn't be able to
deliver the same level of performance on
this more affordable motherboards when
compared to what we were seeing on these
said 370 models MSI though is confident
this isn't the case with their most
premium
the gaming Pro carbon a 210 Australian
dollar motherboard but what about the
more affordable 175 dollar B 360 gaming
plus that's 175 dollars Aussie for those
wondering well let's take a look by
comparing this new B 360 motherboard to
the MSI z3 70 god-like using the core i7
8700 and Core i5 8400 and for those of
you unaware the godlike is an $800 AUD
motherboard right so first up here's a
look at the memory bandwidth performance
and as you can see all test
configurations were able to use ddr4
2666 memory as we're testing Core i5 and
core i7 processors here of course
there's ed 370 board can utilize highest
spec memory with these processors but
let's not worry about that for now as
you can see the memory bandwidth is
exactly the same using either these ed
370 or B 360 board moving on here at the
center bench r15 multi-threaded scores
and starting with the core i5 8400 we
say that it delivers the same score on
both boards using the Box cooler and
also note this CPU is no faster using an
aftermarket cooler though I should also
note this is when testing in a room with
an ambient air temperature of 21 degrees
it's a different story though with the
core i7 8700 using the Box cooler we see
these same performance on both the B 360
and z3 70 boards however if we install a
tower style cooler the score is
increased by 5% as 8,700 goes from an
all-call turbo frequency of 4.1
gigahertz to 4.3 yoghurts and this is
because thermal throttling is no longer
an issue
this performance uplift is being
demonstrated on the B 360 board but it's
the exact same story when testing with
the Zed 370 model using the corona
benchmark we see similar performance
with both the 8,400 and 8700 using
either chipset again it's the same story
when testing with poverty we see with a
better cool the render time was reduced
by a 2% margin with the core i7 8700
more of the same is seen when testing
with blender so I'm going to wrap up the
application testing here and check out a
few games here we see when playing
battlefield 1 that the experience is the
same on the B 360 board as it is on the
Zed 370 please note we are looking
exclusively at the 1% low frame time
performance which
has been converted to an FPS metric
similar results were found when testing
with Far Cry 5 the difference between
the two motherboards can be chalked up
to the margin of error this though is an
interesting result the feature rich is
at 370 godlike is significantly more
power hungry than the B 360 gaming plus
total system consumption for the core i5
8400 was reduced by 25% with the B 360
board while the 8700 saw a 13% reduction
in consumption so it seems these cheaper
motherboards are going to help improve
the performance per watt rating of these
locked intel 6 core CPUs okay so the MSI
B 360 gaming plus had no trouble
matching an extreme Zed 370 mother was
locked coffee-like CPUs of course both
boards were limited to ddr4 2666 memory
naturally the Zed 370 board will pull
away in certain workloads and games when
paired with higher frequency memory and
well that's really a given as I said
earlier though MSI suggests that the B
360 gaming plus will retail for 175
dollars Australian and that places it
just below the cheaper said 370 boards
on the market as an example Emma sighs
owned a Z 370 gaming Plus cost just $200
and for the price of a cheap meal you
get quite a few extras not least of
which is CPU and memory overclocking so
ideally be 360 shoppers will want to
spend less I have to admit that I might
have over achieved here as I convinced
MSI to hand over their be 360m Pro VD
which they say will come in at a hundred
and fifteen dollars Australian though
that is the suggested price and it will
likely cost less than that at least I
really hope it will right now for the
same money you can get the MSI B 250m
Mordor and that's a significantly higher
quality motherboard so realistically I'm
thinking more like eighty to ninety
Australian dollars and probably 60 to 70
dollars u.s. we'll just have to wait and
see though we're pricing heads over the
next few weeks anyway what I can tell
you is that the b-36 TM pro vd is a
super super basic motherboard and is the
most affordable model MSI will be
offering in the be 360 range
besides the basic chipset features
nothing extra has been added to this
tiny micro ATX board there's just two
dimm slots no verum cooling of any kind
and no HDMI
or DisplayPort connectivity there are
none of those natively supported USB 3.1
gen2 ports included just the six gen one
ports along with half a dozen USB 2.0
ports MSI has them including m2 port
which is kind of nice though I'm not
sure how many users seeking an ultra
file will be 360 board will be using m2
storage but it's there if needed
now the vrm is the most concerning
aspect of this board I have to admit but
before I get too carried away I do
realize there aren't too many if any of
you watching that plan on sticking a
$300 u.s. core i7 processor on what's
very likely a sub $100 u.s. motherboard
the B 360 Emperor VD is more of your
core i3 8100 type motherboard may be a
core i5 8400 but probably not a core i7
8700 still I wanted to see how the 8700
got on so this is what I started with
loading up the Intel XTU software we can
already see that like the other objects
menu I looked at in my previous video
the MSI B 360 Pro V D has been
downgraded to a 65 watt maximum turbo
boost power draw with a maximum short
power draw a value 2 watts
in comparison the B 360 gaming plus was
configured for 95 watts and 119 watts
for the max boost so this means we are
seeing a 31% downgrade in power delivery
and this is no doubt going to impact the
core i7 8,700 though based on we saw
with the desk mini it probably shouldn't
hurt the core i5 8400 firing up
Cinebench r15 the 8700 scored just 1211
points but ignoring that first run and
taking the average from 4 more runs
resulted in a score of just eleven
hundred and sixty points
please note for these tests I am using
the deep core gamax 200 t we know what
the deal is with the crappy Intel box
coolers let's just remove thermal
throttling variable from these results
so that means the score is 16% down on
what we saw with the MSI B 360 gaming
plus so let's adjust the turbo boost
parameters and the x2 you software to
match what we saw from the B 360 gaming
plus and run Cinebench r15 for more
times the B 360 Pro VD is now allowing
for a score of over 13 hundred and 50
points and that's within the ballpark of
what we were getting with the gaming
plus not quite as good
but at just under 2% we'll call that
margin of error we could increase the
turbo-boost settings in the x2 you
software further but a long run stress
test reveals why that's only beneficial
for short benchmarks here we have a
complex blender workload and just 30
seconds in we run into a bit of a hiccup
everything looks great for the first 30
seconds the 8700 holds 4.3 gigahertz on
all six cores and we're ripping through
the workload without a problem then like
that the motherboard wins the 8700 back
down to the base clock of 3.2 gigahertz
for seven seconds before cranking it
back up to four point three goats for
eight seconds and then repeating the
process over and over and over again the
reason this is happening is because the
motherboards varium is overheating or at
least reaching the thermal limit and
then backs off the power delivery of the
core i7 8,700 let's the verum cooldown
over about a seven-second period and
then rats power delivery back up until
the thermal limit of the veeram is
reached once again which as I said takes
about eight seconds without sticking
some kind of heat sink on the MOSFETs
it's just not possible to avoid this
throttling issue with the core i7 8700
of course MSI probably aren't expecting
too many people to pair this processor
with their cheapest B 360 motherboard
and even if you do it still works
without an issue it's just slower than a
board with ample cooling but what about
a high-end CPU you're more likely to pay
with a budget board something like a
core i5 8400 without making any
alterations to the B 360 pro V DS
configuration the core i5 8400 scores
877 points on its fourth pass which is
on par with what we saw from the zed 370
god-like that's great news but what
about the long run test well I think
it's time to fire up blender once again
with the 65 watt package TDP sealing the
8400 left us with room to spare every
now and then peaking at just 62 watts
for the entire test which ran for over
an hour
the 8400 held a constant 3.8 gigahertz
without flinching for a second for gamax
200 T kept the CPU very cool at under 60
degrees and we never saw any kind of
throttling that said you won't see
throttling with the Intel Box cooler
either on the 8400 as I found with the
asrock desk many the maximum package
GDP of 65 watts is sufficient for
getting the most out of the core i5 8400
and this is why the Box cooler has no
issue avoiding thermal throttling with
this CPU this means ultra budget boards
like the MSI B 360 pura-vida
are perfect for use with locked core i5
processors such as daddy 400 and while
it does work perfectly fun with the core
i7 8700 as in it's perfectly safe and
perfectly stable without upgrading the
cooling you can expect to receive or
expect to see up to a 20% performance
hit so bear that in mind of course at
this point we're only tested a single
cheap B 360 board and I'll update you as
more boards come in for now though it's
safe to say anyone wanting to build a
core i5 8400 rig on the cheap can do so
with something like the MSI B 360 pro vd
though we strongly suggest you consider
something a little more upmarket like
the B 360 gaming plus if you serious
about your computing and that's going to
do it for this one actually just quickly

msi b 360 carbon pro then head over to
Jared's tech he's a fellow was he that
does great work I'll provide a link in
the video description also the yes man
