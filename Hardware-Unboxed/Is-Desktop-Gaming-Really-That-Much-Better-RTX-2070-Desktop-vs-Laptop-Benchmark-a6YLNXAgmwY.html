launch of invidious
r-tx GPUs for gaming laptops I've been
intrigued about the performance
difference between the laptop and
desktop variants unlike with previous
generation Pascal GPUs there is a
distinct difference in specifications
between GeForce 20 series products
designed for power constrained laptops
and GeForce 20 series discrete GPUs
designed for fully fledged gaming
desktops I wanted to make a video
definitively comparing the two for some
time and with this sort of lull period
before Computex I figured there's no
better time to get some testing under my
belt now some viewers are probably
already wondering why do this analysis
it's obvious the desktop PCs offer
better performance and better value so
do you really need to drop a great big
turd on laptops that's really not my
intention with this video it's not meant
to be a huge attack on gaming laptops
because there is still reasons to buy
one that I'll talk about later the idea
here is to show laptop buyers exactly
how their systems will differ to a
typical gaming desktop which i think is
especially relevant when invidious
naming scheme has muddied the waters a
bit so let's revisit the GeForce 20
series for laptops again and focus in on
the RT X 2070 which is also what I'll be
looking at today
despite Nvidia using the exact same RT X
2017 name for the laptop and desktop
variants the laptop variant is clocked
lower it has the same cuda called count
and same memory configuration but the
boost clock is a hundred and 80
megahertz lower so straight away the
desktop car is 13% faster in games that
are shader limited provided this clock
behavior plays out in the real world
this situation of having the two
versions called the same thing but
differing in performance has already
caught out a lot of people I've seen
many comments from those in our very own
community who was surprised to discover
that if they bought an RT X 27 t laptop
they actually wouldn't be getting RT X
370 desktop performance with desktop
performance being mostly what we focus
on on the channel so that's why I think
talking about these differences and
especially these bad naming practices is
important today's testing is very simple
I've taken an RT X 27 t laptop and
compared it to an RT X 27 T desktop in a
range of games
I haven't tried to make this as super
apples-to-apples comparison where I lock
down the desktops hardware so it can
directly compare the GPUs because the
reality is there are many other factors
that give performance advantages to
desktops in most real world systems for
example laptops are limited to ddr4 2666
memory whereas most PC builders will be
using at least ddr4 3000 considering
it's roughly the same price and indeed
for this testing that's the speed
difference we're seeing both with dual
channel 16 gigabyte kits but the biggest
story is the CPU most gaming laptops are
limited to 45 watt CPUs and in
particular use the core i7 97 58 which
is a 6 core 12 thread CPU that's rated
at a 2.6 gigahertz base and 4.1 googa
Hertz or core boost however due to that
power limit the i7 9750 H often sits in
the mid 3 gigahertz range when fully
utilized in contrast lots of desktop
builders will choose something like the
core i7 8700 K which has a much higher
95 watt TDP and easily exceeds that on a
regular basis it's clocked at a 3.7
gigahertz base and boosts up to 4 point
3 gigahertz all core with typical
behaviors seeing that CPU sit locked at
4.3 gigahertz in a multi-threaded
workload from what I've seen the 8700 K
is usually clocked one gigahertz higher
hood thereabouts now for this test I
could have chosen something much closer
to the core i7 9 750 H like the 35 watt
core i7 8700 T but I thought it was more
appropriate to use one of the most
popular 6 core 1230 gaming CPUs in the
8700 K I also could have chosen to beef
it up more with an 8 core core I $9.99
hundred K but I thought I'd stick to 6
core models here so we can see how a six
core laptop fares against a six core
desktop the laptop I've used today is
the msi ge70 5 Raider 9sf which is
equipped as mentioned with the RT X 2070
laptop variant core i7 9750 H 16
gigabytes of ddr4 2666
and a 1080p display the desktop in
question is my main test rig with an RT
X 2070 founders Edition inside plus a
core i7 8700 K running stock and 16
gigabytes of ddr4 3000 and I also tested
with a 1080p display hooked up and as a
quick note the
- 90 X 2070 is clocked even higher
against the laptop rate 19% higher
rather than 13% but this is the same as
on a factory OC cards that people buy so
let's kick the testing off here with
Metro Exodus and well it's not looking
too bad for the gaming laptop here it is
beaten by the RT X 2070 desktop but only
by 11% looking in average frame rates
and 14% looking at 1% Louis so despite
the RT X between seven-year desktop card
having nearly a 20% clock speed
advantage the real world impact in Metro
is somewhat limited which is nice to see
but things can also go in the complete
opposite direction in Resident Evil 2
the desktop RT X 20 70 beats up on the
laptop vote to the tune of 33% which is
a whopping margin given we are looking
at frame rates well above 100 FPS here I
suspect this is a tag team job with the
faster 8700 K also lending some
assistance to remove CPU bottlenecks
hitman 2 is known to be a CPU demanding
title and that plays out similarly to
Resident Evil 2 delivering a huge 34
percent advantage to the desktop system
although this diminishes to only 22%
when viewing 1% low performance
battlefield 5 is an interesting
situation when looking at average
performance we see the desktop pull
ahead by a reasonable 12% nothing that's
gonna make laptop owners cry but do 1%
lower performance it's clear the desktop
is providing a smoother and more
consistent experience with the 29%
higher one percent low again things like
faster memory in a faster CPU help the
desktop here significantly whereas
laptops can feel a lil stuttery at times
the Assassin's Creed Odyssey results
surprised me a little bit because I know
this can be a very demanding title
however the desktop is a mere 15% faster
which doesn't seem too bad up against
the hitman 2 or Resident Evil 2 results
there also isn't much difference in
framerate stability between the two
systems in Far Cry 5 were back out to
around that nineteen percent margin with
a 14% improvement to 1% loads in favor
of the desktop system so this is bang on
the difference in clock speeds and
fairly representative of the typical
differences here we have Star Wars
Battlefront 2 and like with battlefield
5 this is another game that benefits
from much better 1% low performance with
the desktop system 1% lows a 25% higher
here compared to just a 16% high average
frame
right again in favor of the desktop
system watchdogs to is another one of
those games that tends to struggle the
long laptops given its heavy GPU and CPU
requirements despite being a few years
old now so it's no surprise to see that
it too is a title with much high against
one percent less than average frame
rates when comparing the two systems
shadow of the Tomb Raider is a really
interesting case in one of the worst for
the laptop here the average frame rates
are 32% high on the desktop system but
the one percent lows are more than twice
as high the laptop is noticeable
stuttering during some of the areas of
the benchmark run whereas the desktop
does not and I benchmarked this set of
data at least 10 times because I really
wasn't convinced about these margins but
every time the desktop absolutely smoked
the laptop so well here we are
and finally I'm close near the in depth
section with Grand Theft Auto 5 the
oldest title here but also still quite
popular among gamers the desktop RT X
370 holds a 17% advantage in average
frame rates but surprisingly the damage
to 1% loads is limited to just 10% which
is one of the smallest differences I've
seen so far
here is the full performance breakdown
comparing the RT X 2070 in desktops to
the RT X 2070 in laptops across the
games I've just talked about plus a few
extras thrown into the mix when
comparing average frame rates we left
with the desktop clocking in 19% faster
on average coincidentally this is
identical to the difference in clock
speeds now I say coincidentally here
because when we get a 19% clock speed
improvement on paper it's typical to see
maybe a 15 to 16 percent improvement in
real-world performance and as you can
see a lot of titles fall into that sort
of bracket quite consistently however
the average gain is boosted by a few
outliers that benefit from the desktop
PCs advantages in other areas like CPU
performance when comparing the
difference in 1% low performance things
are a little more all over the place
there are some games where the
difference really isn't that large maybe
only 11 to 13 percent in favor of the
desktop but then there are some
significant outliers like shadow of the
Tomb Raider and Deus Ex mankind divided
where the desktop is literally twice as
fast in this crucial metric the overall
average of 34% is listed here but with
this sort of variance it's not all that
useful I haven't really talked about
max-q laptops much in this video yet but
I thought I'd throw this die
in here as well this is the performance
difference between the desktop
RTX 2070 and the max-q variant of the
r-tx 2070 the max-q model is designed
for even more constrained systems
typically thin and light machines and is
clocked considerably lower than the
desktop and even the laptop variants so
it's no surprise that on average the
r-tx 2070 for desktops is 42% faster
while this margin is enormous at least
the max-q model has a different name so
what is this data telling us well simply
put the desktop RTX 27 he was caught 19%
high in my test configurations then the
laptop RTX 2070 and performs 19 % better
on average while GPU boost does play
around with clock speeds there's not
some magical wizard in the background
boosting the laptop model up to the
level of the desktop card the difference
in clock speeds on paper does play out
in the real world while this is
generally the case there are also some
times where a desktops other advantages
assist with performance a faster CPU
helps with 1% lower performance as does
faster memory depending on where the
bottlenecks lie better cooling
capabilities allow the desktop to cope
with a wider range of operating
conditions without throttling and of
course the desktop has much higher scope
for overclocking which is typically very
limited or even non-existent in laptops
but all of those additional factors are
known if you put an 8700 canid desktop
of course it will perform better than
the lower clock i 790 750 H of course a
much larger desktop is going to have
better cooling the real issue here is
that an everyday user might not know
that the RT X 27 in laptops isn't the
same as the art X 27 in desktops so you
can't expect the same performance and
this issue is caused by both products
having the same name if you've seen
performance or even just gameplay
footage from an RT X 2070 in a desktop
how are you supposed to know this same
GPU going on its name in the laptop is
actually 60% slower
unless you dig into the spec sheets I
really hope we don't see this confusion
play out with future product lines I
hope new video learns from the mess with
doing this dodgy product naming stuff I
really don't like it and I hope that
with the next generation of products
from them that they go back to either
giving the laptops and desktops the
exact same GPUs with the same specs or
calling those map top models something a
little different
aside from my complaints with
the other thing to talk about when
comparing desktops and laptops is value
desktop PCs are not only faster but
cheaper even when factoring in
peripherals that are integrated into the
laptop form factor the exact r-tx
between 70 test system I used costs
around 1,700 US dollars to build
yourself and then you can throw in a
1080p 144 Hertz display mechanical
keyboard and a decent Mouse for about
three hundred dollars more and there you
have a two thousand dollar system MSI's
ge 75 Rader also costs $2,000 so at face
value there's no difference in price but
there is a handy difference in
performance with a win there to the
desktop however my test system does have
a few overkill components in it that are
more designed for testing higher-end
configurations you really don't need
something like a Zen 390 or s master or
H 115 i platinum for a standard built
swap a couple of those components out
with more reasonable stuff and the
entire system price drops to $1,800 so
you end up saving $200 compared to the
laptop and the left with better gaming
performance there is no doubt building a
desktop PC and buying the necessary
peripherals is a better bang for buck
option than buying a gaming laptop but
again this doesn't mean laptops are
pointless in fact they have a very
specific in hand a use case and that's
portability it's much easier to take
around slimmest laptop to various places
then it used to lug a desktop PC monitor
keyboard and mouse so what you sacrifice
in performance and value tends to go
towards having everything in a highly
portable form factor with that said it's
important to keep this trade-off in mind
when tossing it between a desktop and
laptop there are many times they hear
stories or know of people that keep
their gaming laptop planted on their
desk they never take it around and they
even hook out to external peripherals
like perhaps a higher resolution display
these people really shouldn't have
bought a gaming laptop they should have
gone down the desktop route because if
you're not actively harnessing the
portability aspect of gaming laptops
while you're missing out on valuable
performance so those are my thoughts on
laptops versus desktops and how to
systems with similar specs in some areas
can differ in performance this tends to
be a question we get a lot in our Q&amp;amp;A
series and on our videos as well you
know should I buy a laptop or desktop
considering my use case what are the
differences in performance and so on so
hopefully this video gives those people
information they were looking for as
always you can subscribe for more
content and there's no better time than
now with Computex just around the corner
