I'm your host Matt and today we're going
to be taking a quick look at the rocket
rious tkl pro gaming keyboard rocket has
quickly become a rather popular gaming
peripherals company known for their high
quality and reasonably priced Mike's
keyboards and headsets rock out of the
kind of company that spends time
developing quality products rather than
Pompey on a refresh every few months and
it shows the variety KL pro is no
exception the build quality is the first
thing you notice when you pick up this
keyboard it's waiting for its size and
despite being 100% plastic coated the
materials give a very high-quality feel
it's smooth blacks all around on the
rise tkl Prohm aside from a dotter
bridge that wraps around the keys the
USB cable is wrapped in braided fabric
and it can be routed through the
trademark rock-out wire channels on the
underside of the keyboard the wrist rest
is compulsory on this keyboard meaning
its non-detachable if you've watched any
of my mechanical keyboard reviews then
you know that this doesn't bother me in
the slightest and typically the bigger
the wrist rest is the better the rest on
the tee calpro is quite sizable offering
plenty of elevation and depth the wrist
rest is also where you'll find the three
thumbs to profile switching keys when I
initially saw these buttons and their
location all's worried about
accidentally hitting them for due to
their flat design and sufficient
resistance it was never an issue during
gaming or general typing on the
technical side of things the Tikal Pro
is equipped with two AR M 32-bit
processors is capable of a thousand
Hertz polling rate and it features the
rather standard now n key rollover for a
best anti-ghosting behind the keys of
the also industry standard Cherry MX
switches now modal was equipped with
cherry MX red which are a lighter switch
you can also get this keyboard with
either blue black or brown cherry MX
switches per your preference lighting
wise the T Cal Pro is not equipped with
RGB ease and instead features perky
illuminating blue back lights these can
be configured in just about any way
imaginable in the rock out software
interface which I'll touch on next from
the keyboard itself though you can
toggle between six brightness levels and
by default there are some different
lighting effects to configure to the
three thumbs to profiles
rock out software is not compulsory to
use the keyboard and most of
speeches but if you'd like to play
around with the key mapping and lighting
functions and you need to go ahead and
make the small 17 megabyte downloads the
main ctrl tab allows you to control and
toggle the most common functions
including key light brightness a timeout
or screensaver setting sound feedback
when you change selected settings such
as profiles and a few other things in
the key assignment tab you can do just
that
assign functions to any specific key on
the keyboard and the key illumination
tab is also pretty self-explanatory the
rocket our ad tab gives you access to
rock out achievements and trophies and
the update support tab allows you to
update drivers firmware and get online
support on every tab we also have access
to the game profiles at the bottom over
all the rocket variety Cal Pro is a
really great 10 keyless mechanical
gaming keyboard solution with a perky
illumination and powerful software games
like to play around and tweak these
settings can do so to their heart's
content the build quality is impressive
too with surfaces that don't show up
fingerprints much at all and it was
definitely soot those who enjoy a high
keyboard with a large wrist rest the 10
keyless aspect is not for everybody
however for portability it's great and
if you test it out you may find you like
having your mouse and that much closer
to the center of the keyboard I know I
do in gaming especially available for a
hundred and 40 USD shift
I feel the T Cal Pro is appropriately
priced considering its perky
illumination and features despite being
10 kilos thanks for watching another
