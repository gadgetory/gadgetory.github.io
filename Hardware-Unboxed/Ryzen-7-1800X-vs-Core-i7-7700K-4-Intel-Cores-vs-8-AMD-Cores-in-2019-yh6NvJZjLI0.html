are revisiting the battle between the
horizon 7 1800 x and core i7 7700 k now
before we get too far into it a couple
of things I should just explain I'm
using the 1800 X and not the cheaper
1700 because well realistically I could
only pick one verizon 7 processor for
this comparison due to the time
investment and the 95 watt TDP 1800 X is
a better Rison 7 representative I feel
especially if I could only pick one now
to be completely clear upon released the
1800 X did carry an MSRP of $500 u.s.
making it considerably more expensive
than the core i7 7700 K which was priced
at $340 u.s. this made the Rison 7 1700
the more direct competitor as it was
priced just 330 dollars u.s. but it
wasn't long before AMD started executing
price cuts and the 1800 X dropped down
to roughly match the core i7 processor
for example the 1800 X dropped down to
just three hundred and twenty dollars us
on new egg in the same year of its
release and has since dropped as low as
220 dollars u.s. at the same online
retailer
so since I'm overclocking both the core
i7 and rise and seven processors in this
video I will be showing out-of-the-box
performance as well but they'll also be
overclocking results and since the Rison
7 1700 typically hits 4 gigahertz as
well it'll deliver the exact same
overclock performance that you'll see
from the 1800s in this video I'm about
to quickly go over the test system specs
then we'll jump into the benchmarks but
before that meet as rocks new flagship
Zed 390 motherboard the phantom gaming X
it's packed with loads of upgrades
including a six hundred amp capacity 12
phase V core VRM 2.5 Gigabit LAN with an
additional 2 Gigabit LAN connectors
Wi-Fi 6 creative Sound Blaster cinema 5
loads of USB 3.0 ports SATA ports and m2
ultra ports there's also a number of
really nice design elements such as
integrated i/o shield stainless steel
PCIe covers a massive heat sink for
cooling the m2 drives a metal backplate
and much much more so for more
information please check
the link in the video description now
for memory I've armed an art about using
expensive low latency Samsung video
stuff for these cpu reviews but after
much consideration I've decided that I
will use G skills flare X ddr4 3200 CL
14 memory and that is of course
high-quality Samsung video stuff and I'm
going to use this for a few reasons
firstly these aren't budget processes so
spending a bit of extra money on memory
isn't out of the question and secondly
we're testing CPU gaming performance
with an RC X xx atti
to remove any GPU bottlenecks so why do
that and then risk limiting performance
using slower system memory so that's my
reasoning there really shouldn't bother
you too much one way or the other as
long as both CPUs were tested with the
exact same memory in total nine games
have been tested at two resolutions
along with a few application benchmarks
so let's get into it
starting off this benchmark session we
have Cinebench are 20 and Cinebench has
always been good at showing the two
tails of horizon here we have the
multi-threaded performance and despite a
rather large clock speed deficit we see
Rison has no trouble stepping all over
the core i7 processor out of the box
that core processor is 55 percent faster
and that's obviously very impressive
though it does of course have 100
percent more cause still when fully
utilized it's clear the 7700 K is no
match for the 1800 X but here's the
other side of this story the single core
performance here the 77 ok is 22% faster
out of the box and also when overclocked
this gives the Intel CPU a significant
advantage in likely threat of workloads
workloads that don't max out the core i7
processor WinRAR for example is more
about memory bandwidth and latency than
it is about cores and as a result the 77
ok is around 8% faster in this
particular workload certainly not a
massive difference but given what we saw
in the cinnamon jar 20 multi-core test
it's probably not the result you would
have expected moving on we have a
benchmark that's of particular
importance to me
as I use Premiere Pro on an almost daily
basis please note that lower is better
here and we're looking at the time it
takes to encode our hardware unbox
videos at 4k using the h.264 for
here we see that the 1800 X is 43%
faster
taking just 508 seconds out of the box
so for content creators the eight core
CPU is the obvious choice and it really
was a godsend for creators at the time
likewise the 1800 X was welcomed with
open arms by 3d modeling professionals
here we see when using the latest
version of v-ray that the 1800 X is 57%
faster than the 77 RK out of the box and
50% faster once both CPUs are
overclocked we see a similar story with
Corona here the 1800 X was again 57%
faster out of the box completing the
task in just 131 seconds now the last
application benchmark that we're going
to look at is blender and here the 1800
X was 62% faster and 60% faster once
overclocked so obviously a massive
advantage here for the horizon processor
just quickly when running the blender
workload I also measured the total
system consumption and here the Rison 7
1800 X only pushed total power draw 26%
higher
not bad given we saw around a 60%
increase in performance overclocking
though kind of blows rising sufficiency
out of the window and frankly the 32
percent increase in system power draw
isn't worth the minor increase in
performance okay time for some games
first up we have Assassin's Creed
Odyssey and here the 7700 K was 5%
faster on average and 8% faster for the
1% low result and we see that the
margins remained fairly similar once
overclocked as you'd expect moving to
1440p does reduce the margin as we
become slightly more GPU limited at once
overclocked both CPUs were able to max
out the RT x20 atti it's also worth
noting that we're not using the highest
quality preset an assassin's creed
Odyssey so it is possible to make the
game much more GPU bound without a
resolution increase the battlefield 5
results are quite interesting here the
7700 K is maxed out and while it does do
much better than the 7600 K you can see
the 1% low is down on the 1800 X which
enjoys considerably more breathing room
so in this instance the average
framerate can be quite misleading as the
1800 X definitely provides the smoother
experience in this title
even at 1440p the 70 similar K is still
getting maxed out and as such provides a
noticeably worse experience when
compared to the
200x of course the game is still very
playable on the 7700 K but given the
choice of these two processes for
battlefield 5 I'm confident most gamers
would choose the 1800 X here we see the
7700 K makes out rather well and shut
off the Tomb Raider and this is entirely
down to its hyper-threading support
previously when we tested the 7600 K it
really struggled in this tile and was
noticeably slower than the r5 1600 the
77 arcade didn't exactly blow the 1,800
ex away and both did deliver smooth very
playable performance but overall the
core i7 processor was faster by a
reasonable 11% margin jumping to 1440p
does cut that performance margin down
quite considerably
but the 7700 was still faster this time
by 6 percent margin when comparing the
average frame rate the division 2 is
another title where the 7600 case
struggled but here we see with the aid
of hyper threading the 77 arcane makes
out just fine and is quite a bit faster
than the 1800 X when comparing the one
percent low performance we see that the
1800 X does come back quite a bit at the
more GPU limited 1440p resolution that
said the 77 RK was still around 11%
faster when comparing the one percent
low results once again we see that it's
far cry where the Rison CPUs really
struggle here the 77 hurricane was a
whopping 24 percent faster out of the
box and 31 percent faster once
overclocked the Rison 7 processor was
able to keep frame rates above 60 FPS at
all times and the gaming experience was
nice and smooth but the 7700 Kate was
just a lot better over all even at 1440p
we see that for high refresh rate gaming
in Far Cry nude on the 77 arcade is just
a much better processor for the job this
time overclocked it was 35% faster and
that is a truly massive difference for
the CPU to make at 1440p even with an RT
X xx atti
the Rison processor also loses out in
World War Z but this loss is less
significant as both CPUs led the RT X xx
atti to render over 130 FPS at all times
still if it's more power you seek then
the 77 or K can push around 14% more
frames naturally the margins are reduced
at 1440p and here the 77 RK was up to
8% faster needless to say both CPUs
enabled an excellent gaming experience
like World War Z rage - isn't a very CPU
demanding title and here the 77 ok an
1800 X provided the same average
framerate data that said the higher
clocked 7700 K did sustain a higher 1%
low result offering around 12% more
performance here the margin is reduced
to basically nothing at 1440p and it's
fair to say both CPUs provided these
same gaming experience the
first-generation CPUs don't do that well
in hitman 2 and you'll see a rather
significant improvement in performance
especially for the 1% lower result when
moving to a 2nd gen rise in part such as
the 2700 X again the 1800 X did enable a
very playable very smooth performance
but the 77 RK did the same with around
18 or 20 percent more frames even at
1440p we still appear to be largely CPU
bound and as a result the 77 RK does
provide a slightly better gaming
experience last up we have Total War
three kingdoms and here both CPUs
achieve a similar average framerate but
the higher core count 1800 X does
provide a noticeably better 1% low
performance this is also seen at 1440p
when comparing out-of-the-box
performance but we see that the 4.8
gigahertz overclock does get the 7700 K
up to speed so it seems for modern games
the core i7 7700 K and risin 7 1800 X
are quite evenly matched there are still
some newer but still lightly threaded
games where the 77 Erica enjoys a rather
significant framerate advantage but in
all of those titles the 1800 X still
provided smooth playable performance on
the other side of that though in the
more demanding titles where we saw the
77 our case starting to get well pretty
well tapped out the 1% low performance
did suffer and honestly this situation
isn't that dissimilar to what I found in
a day 1 review 2 years ago now it's just
more pronounced now and before I
continue here is a direct quote from the
conclusion of my now two-year-old day
one
Rison 7 review one thing I did notice is
that all games that I've looked at so
far which is considerably more than the
four shown here were smooth on the rise
and processors GTA 5 for example
plays really well on the core i7 77 okay
but every now and then a small stutter
can be noticed while the 1800 X runs as
smooth as silk sans stuttering from what
I've observed I found a similar
situation when testing battlefield one
performance was smooth with the rising
processes while every now and then the
quad core 77 RK had a small hiccup these
were rare but it was something I didn't
notice when using the 1800 X and 1700 X
but as smooth as the experience was it
doesn't change the fact that game is
running a high refresh rate monitor may
be better served by the higher clocked
core i7 6700 K or 7700 K while the
gaming results might not be as strong as
what we had hoped for
they are highly competitive and that
should hold particularly true for the
Rison 5 and 3 series it's also worth
noting that we are testing extreme
gaming performance here with a Titan XP
at 1080p
raisa looks more competitive a 1440p and
certainly so when paired with the gtx
1070 or fury x for the most part i'd say
that conclusion is still accurate today
though I certainly never recommend the
77 RK over any Rison 7 part in 2019 even
if it was the same price the 77 RK also
left a bad taste in our mouth after
releasing it in early 2017 for $340 us
on the LGA 1151 socket it was
effectively dead within that same year
in order to remain competitive Intel
tacked on two extra cores and released
to the 8700 K in late 2017 for 360
dollars u.s. and they did so using the
same but also completely incompatible
LGA 1151 socket this left those who
invested in the 77 RK with nowhere to go
while Verizon owners can still upgrade
to this very day so in a way the 77 RK
was one of the greatest traps of 2017
unleashed by Intel on its own customers
ouch even today the 77 Erich 8 is still
a very capable gaming processor so not
trying to take anything away from it but
as a quad core in 2019 it is starting to
falter on the other hand I expect the
first generation 7 processors to
gradually
proved over the coming years as games
continue to utilize or continue to
better utilize the eight core sixteen
thread processors and I think that's
gonna do it for this one if you enjoyed
