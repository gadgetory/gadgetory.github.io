Thermaltake Corp III in partnership with
Thermaltake I'm giving away three of
these beautiful awesome cases to enter
sign up at our forum a hardware on box
comm post a picture of your current rig
your specs and quickly tell me what you
want to do with the core p3 good luck
and enjoy the video
finally the time has come to finish my
thermaltake or p3 build and we'll see if
it actually works in part 2 I finished
up with the components installed
including the water blocks radiator pump
and reservoir I was very pleased with
the end result and while I was
celebrating progress it quickly dawned
on me that the hard part was still to
come the hard part being those v2 blurr
PT G tubes or hard tubes and layman's
terms before I get bending let's check
out the build so far the Pacific w3
water block is a thing of beauty and
that P mm a cover is gonna look even
more amazing with the blue liquid
coursing through its 0.15 millimeter
fins I also really like how the black
Pacific compression fittings look they
really blend in with the rest of the
build nicely that g.skill tried and said
memory has going on as well as to the
blue and black TT mods sleeve cables the
aluminium covers featured on the Pacific
P r22 d5 silent kit look very clean and
again the black pacific compression
fitting is the perfect option here
unfortunately I only had a chrome stop
plug left to plug up the fill port but
it actually looks pretty good anyway two
of the black stock plugs I have for this
build we use them the GPU water block
and I think this was a good choice
coupled with the black 90 degree
adapters on the opposite side the
Pacific Fiji TX 10 series found edition
transparent water block looks incredible
even before we connected up again the
blue and black TT mods sleeve cables
look great in the 8 pin cables it hooks
up to the GTX 1080 really looks apart
ok so now that I've finished drooling
over what's still very much the
unfinished build I suppose we'd better
get on with it
you
you
so that'll went a lot better than
expected I was really surprised with how
great the tubes in particular were to
work with I guess I wouldn't recommend
it for novice builders that haven't
really done anything similar before but
honestly I've never headed up a plastic
tube invented in my life and with only a
few little hiccups I managed to get it
done and I'm happy with the result then
one takes to bending kit though is
absolutely necessary without it I would
have been up the creek without a paddle
now let's take a closer look at some of
the finer details since I was using
transparent blocks from the CPU and
graphics card I had the idea to place
LEDs underneath to light the acrylic
covers this gives a pretty cool effect I
think especially on the CPU block to
avoid running an ugly cable across the
motherboard I made a slightly cheeky mod
to the LED strip by sniffing it and then
attaching a three pin fan header for
power this plugs into the chassis fan
port right next to the CPU we've also
got a fast and furious style blue LED
strip across the bottom of the case
which shines down to the desk below like
Paul Walker's r34 so that's obviously
awesome that improves the system's
quarter-mile times I also stuck some RGB
lights behind the graphics card as well
as the motherboard and these can be
controlled by a remote being the idiot I
am mowing for the more difficult multi
band style in the pipes only using
joiners at the insertion points would
have been a lot easier only doing a
single Bend on each part so if you're
looking at bending and finding it a
little intimidating that I'd recommend
that is the way to go
as mentioned the tube bending kid is a
godsend and helps enormously whether you
plan to be super ambitious or not
overall and really happy it's definitely
the coolest system I've ever built now
call me to start using it as my personal
gaming rig I've got one more installment
in the series to come where I'm going to
be finally benchmarking this piece and
checking out the temperatures I'm
expecting very good things and it'll be
pretty nuts if we had this fans Edition
GT X 1080 you're running under 50
degrees I can't wait to find out don't
forget about my global giveaway where
I'm giving away three of these also
