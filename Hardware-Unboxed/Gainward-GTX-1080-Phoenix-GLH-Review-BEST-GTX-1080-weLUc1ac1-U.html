again with another GTA X 1080 part and
card review this time on hand is game
with Phoenix to LA tradition last week I
checked out the gigabyte GT X 1080 g1
gaming model which boasted improved
thermals when compared to in videos
Founders edition unfortunately despite a
redesigned PCB and the upgraded cooler
the g1 gaming wasn't able to outperform
the founders Edition resulting in very
similar custom overclocked performance
although gigabyte only went with a
single 8 pin PCI Express power connector
that doesn't appear to be the issue as
others are reporting similar results on
heavily modified models from a serious
LMS I for example as disappointing as
the initial board partner overclocking
results have been the improved thermals
and slightly more affordable price tags
are welcomed of course with availability
still poor it's likely going to be a few
weeks yet before we see the Pascal based
1080 and 1070 graphics cards selling at
or near the MSRP this sucks for those of
us desperate to get our hands and one of
these new cards and a reasonable price
but this is really nothing new almost
all nvidia and AMD high-end GPUs have
suffered the same poor availability
early on in life anyway once
availability does improve and pricing
stabilizes one board partner I am
expecting to deliver the goods is game
word when it comes to pricing game would
always seem to be one of the most
competitive at least down here in
Australia the gtx 980ti which is a
superb overclock Oh has always been one
of the cheaper options available having
been so impressed with their gtx 980ti
phoenix golden sample graphics card i've
been really keen to check out the
flagship GD X 1080 Fenix goes like Hal
edition to see if it actually does go
like hell before jumping into the
benchmarks let's take a closer look at
the Phoenix GLH by stripping it down to
see what makes it tick something you
notice right away is just how massive
this graphics card is every dimension
has been super-sized gained weight
hasn't just made a big for the sake of
it either and instead of made the most
of the space available the PCB measures
267 millimeters long while the card
stretches 285 millimeters long thanks to
the oversized cooler this huge cooler
takes I'm not two but three slots of 48
millimeters thick making this a 2 and a
half or let's say three
slot graphics card in comparison the
founders edition cooler measures 35
millimeters thick and 266 millimeters
long more typical dimensions for dual
slot graphics card the PCB is also 20
millimeters taller than standard
allowing a Phoenix GLH to send 133
millimeters tall and the heat seems to
make use of the extra head room
underneath the large fan shroud which I
should point out has been constructed
from plastic with anodized aluminium
trimmings we find two truly massive heat
sinks in total there's 120 millimeters
by 185 millimeters the 30 millimeters
thick worth of heatsink improving
efficiency a 3/8 millimeter copper heat
pipes along with an additional 2 6
millimeter copper heat pipes these heat
pipes also connect to a large copper
base pushing large volumes of air over
this huge heatsink surface area to big
100 millimeter fans featuring game words
new blade fin design these fans are
extremely quiet even when the card's
been placed on the load for an extended
period that reworked PCB that I
mentioned earlier has a similar 8+2
phase power design seen on the gigabyte
g1 gaming card the g1 gaming featured
our 15 magic chokes while the game wood
card uses r22 chokes I'm not
knowledgeable enough about these to tell
you what the difference is and I haven't
been able to research anything useful at
a guest I would say the r22 is are rated
for a high capacity but that's really
just a guess anyway what I can tell you
is the game wood card also features a 6
pin PCI power connector along with the
standard 8 pin connector this defines
the phoenix gel h an extra 75 watts of
power input this hasn't proven
particularly useful for other brands so
I'm keen to see if the phoenix gel age
can make use of the extra power out of
the box the game with GD X 1080 finished
GLS is clocked higher than gigabytes g1
gaming with a base clock speed of 70 and
46 megahertz and a boost clock of 1885
megahertz the memory has also been
boosted from 5 gigahertz to 5.2 5
gigahertz resulting in a data rate of
10.5 gigabits per second around the back
we find a huge full sized backplate
protecting the card that the aluminium
plate is pretty boring in terms of
design the i/o configuration remains
standard with a single dual link DVI
output HDMI 2.0 B and three display
ports as we often do we'll kick off our
results with battlefield 4 here the game
wood card was good for 59 FPS out of the
box and an impressive 6
for FPS when overclocked for an 8%
performance boost the out-of-the-box
stats are particularly impressive here
it goes like hell card was 5% faster
than both the stock founders edition
card and the g1 gaming card and was also
23% faster than my overclocked 980ti
this card was also 3 percent faster than
the founders edition overclock and just
2 percent faster than its OCD gigabyte
rival next up we've got Far Cry primal
as you can see the GLH card was our best
performer again with our impressive
overclock managing to render 49 FPS this
was the 7% boost over the out-of-the-box
configuration which itself was able to
match the overclocked founders Edition
card and beat the g1 gaming Carter my
results it was also 21% faster than the
980ti with my overclock applied star
wars battlefront showed pretty similar
results again
all in favor of game was cool and quiet
card here we see a boost of just 5%
however this was 7% more performance
than the overclocked founders Edition 2
ng 1 out of the box you can expect to
see a massive 12% more performance in
the stock founders Edition and 27% more
than the 980ti or see interestingly in
the division the stock GLH was able to
match the overclocked founders card as
well as the overclocked g1 gaming at 47
FPS with our custom overclock applied
attacked on an extra 4 FPS for a 9%
performance boost with all cards at
stock configuration the GLH was 9
percent faster than the fe and 7 percent
faster than the g1 in the new doom game
we see the exact same thing as the
division the stock clock jlh matched the
overclocked farms edition in g1 gaming
with 73 FPS our custom overclock was
able to net an additional 5 FPS for a
nice little 7% boost with my comment
section in mind how could I leave out
ARMA 3 I couldn't hear the overclocked
JH pumped out an extremly playable 47
frames per second beating out our other
overclocked 1080s by 3 FPS out of the
box the car was also great with 42 FPS
which was 19% more than the overclocked
980ti despite the heavier factory
overclock the glh consumed no more power
than the g1 gaming out of the box
overclocked we see consumption does
increase by 28 watts though this is
still less than a stock gtx 980ti this
is where the GLH really impressed the
operating temperatures that massive heat
seemed proved invaluable here allowing
the card to operate it just 68 degrees
under full load and it's out of the box
configure
that's a five-degree improvement over
the already impressive g1 gaming however
with the fan operating at just 1050 RPM
using the auto fan profile the card was
completely silent winding the fan speed
up to 1500 RPM meant that I could just
hear the GLH over the case fans a barely
audible hum if you will
anyway this allowed the cards operating
temperature to drop down to a chilly 58
degrees impressive stuff not just that
but when overclock the card never
exceeded 73 degrees the same temperature
the g1 gaming operated at out of the box
this explains why the GLH was so much
faster in some games it's able to
maintain a much higher boost clock
frequency this is more what I was hoping
for decent performance gains over the
Nvidia founders edition graphics card on
average the game with GD X 1080 fenix
GLH was 9 percent faster than the
founders Edition out of the box while it
was 7 percent faster with both cards
overclocked to their maximum stable
frequencies when compared to the g1
gaming the Fenix GLH was 5 percent
faster out of the box and 6 percent
faster once comparing both cards
overclocked the Fenix GLH was also 20%
faster than our overclocked gtx 980ti
reference card price-wise I expect the
finished GLH to sell for less than the
founders Edition once it goes on sale
how close it will get to the partner
board MSRP of $600 though is anyone's
guess at this point what I can tell you
is the game was GD X 1080 Fenix GLH is
the best GD X 1080 example I've seen yet
the massive cooler allows it to run cool
and quiet while maximizing the operating
frequency it's difficult to say if all
Fenix GLH cards will overclock and run
as well as the one I have on hand I
could have done well in the silicon
lottery after all that said the moment
they go on sale down under I'll pick up
a second card and let you guys know what
I find thanks for joining me for another
GD X 1080 review is the goes like hell
card on your radar for purchase now let
me know in the comments section
I'm your host Matt as always and I'll
see you guys next time YouTube</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
