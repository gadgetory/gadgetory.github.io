especially with an enormous growth in
the industry worldwide the game is like
you and me this is great news and it
certainly made me very excited for an
even bigger 2016 as such I put together
my list of the top 10 PC games we can
almost look forward to in 2016
starting at number 10 is a brand new
installment from Blizzard called
overwatch a strategic cooperative
multiplayer first-person shooter where
two teams of six go head to head each
with their own selected heroes it can be
chosen from a group of four different
classes to me the game seems reminiscent
of team fortress 2 in terms of style I
can't wait to see the kind of polished
and balanced game player that the
brilliant blizzard group will
undoubtedly produce overwatch is
expected to be released either quarter
one or quarter two of 2016 and knowing
blizzard and won't be any earlier than
that following closely on from dark
souls 2 Dark Souls 3 finds itself at
number 9 on my list this very
challenging third-person role-playing
action adventure will appeal to hardcore
gamers and enjoy having a legitimate
challenge as I searched desperately for
the next bonfire that will offer some
relief in terms of a checkpoint expected
for release in late March early April
2016 you can expect to see me dive
rolling and swinging swords with the
rest of the fans of the series
following up to 2011's deus ex human
revolution they use X mankind divided
takes eight spot on my list the stealthy
first-person role-playing shooter sees
the return of protagonist Adam Jensen
equipped with the host of new technology
and augmentations and with a mission to
stop a wave of terrorist attacks mankind
divided isn't scheduled for release
until august so fans of the series left
away quite a few months to get their
hands on the exciting title ii Valkyrie
holds a distinct advantage in terms of
anticipation it's bundled with the
release of the long-awaited virtual
reality device the oculus rift moving
away from its massively multiplayer
online prequel Eve Valkyrie is a
multiplayer space dog fighting games set
in the eve-online universe that will be
compatible with both the oculus rift and
Sony's PlayStation VR with an oculus
rift on pre-order and on eventual route
to the hardware unbox studios I know I
can't wait to launch into space and
shoot down some fellow noobs
Ubisoft sends game is literally back to
the Stone Age at number six on our list
Far Cry primal set 12,000 years ago in a
fictional open-world land called orous
players will encounter danger from
saber-toothed Tigers great woolly
mammoths other tribes and the elements
themselves crafting and survival appear
to play a key role in this newest Far
Cry installment and don't expect to find
any vehicles or guns laying around your
only weapons will be clubs Spears bows
in the lock slated for release on PC or
march the first we very much looking
forward to getting back to our caveman
roots the original were there to make
quite a splash on release with its
amazingly fun parkour freerunning style
gameplay now gamers don't have to look
too far into the future to look forward
to its sequel Mirror's Edge catalyst a
more exciting clipping diving and wall
running action this time around players
will control protagonist faith connors
in a completely open world environment
which is a very welcome change the
linear level style original and I think
it's a really super star of the game
that it is it appears as though the game
will only be multiplayer in the style
that just cause 3 was with time trials
and game records and the like March 24th
is the north american release date and
fans of the original be left salivating
until then it never sleeps it exists
and once you learned taking place after
the events of hitman absolution 2016
edition of hitman focuses on delivering
better sandbox mechanics as it places
players on huge maps in a variety of
countries and cities including Paris
Italy in Marrakech with Thailand the USA
and Japan being released as additional
episodes when they've finished being
developed each location will have
multiple missions and rather than an
overarching story each assassination
will have its own smaller story the
initial release is set for March 2016
and we'll look on with great curiosity
as it nears release day the more
information comes out taking place long
after the events of the first three Mass
Effect games Mass Effect Andromeda is
being developed on dices frostbite 3
engine and according to bioware gamers
can expect a new swath of exciting Wales
to discover great characters and intense
action some sort of multiplayer
component it has been confirmed and
players can also expect to see the
return of the Mako the six-wheeled
vehicle feature in the first Mass Effect
game not scheduled for release into a
queue for 2016 the enormous fan base of
the series have some time to wait and
it's hard knowing that you belong here
announced at e3 in 2013 tom clancy's the
division is an open-world third-person
shooter that takes place in the mid
crisis New York players learn experience
points as they progress allowing them to
customize and upgrade their character
backpack weapons and gear as well as
talents and skill as they go there will
also be a focused on teaming up with
other division ages throughout the game
and the open-world destructible
environments look to offer all kinds of
different strategic and tactical
elements they'll hopefully truly
separate this title from other third
person shooters originally only
scheduled for console release PC gamers
petition for a master race release
they'll be deservedly getting it on
marks the eighth I've seen things
excuses dealing number one spot on our
list is an indie game I've been
following for some time no man sky I'm
most interested in this title for the
simple fact that it just looks so damn
different to anything else I've seen
players are thrust into not an open
world environment but literally in open
universe environments whether over 18
quintillion procedurally generated
planets that's 1.8 times 10 to the 19th
place and each planet is unique some
with their own fauna and flora players
will gain materials and blueprints as
they explore to upgrade their characters
and equipment allowing them to explore
deeper into the universe and discover
more and more information that they can
report back to the Atlas a central
database that can be shared with the
other players of the game this game
honestly has me intrigued and that June
2016 release date can't get here soon
enough so that's it thanks for tuning in
to my top 10 countdown and if you're as
excited for PC gaming as I am in 2016
don't forget to hit like hit subscribe
and I'll see you next time
