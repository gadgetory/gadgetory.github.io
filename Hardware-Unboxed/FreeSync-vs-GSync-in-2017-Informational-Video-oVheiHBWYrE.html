hardware unboxed adaptive sync display
technologies both Nvidia and AMD have
been available on the market for several
years now initially Nvidia g-sync and
Amy's rethink different quite
differently in the implementation and
user experience but now that both
technologies and ecosystems have matured
I figured it's a good opportunity to
revisit g-sync and free sync to see
where the difference is currently lie in
2017 free sync uses the visa adaptive
sync standard a component of DisplayPort
1.2 a along with a variety of
off-the-shelf display scalars that
support adaptive sync g-sync
uses a proprietary model from Nvidia in
place of the usual display scaler though
it also communicates over display point
the proprietary module along with the
closed nature of the juicing platform
makes it more expensive to implement and
free sync which I'll explore in more
detail a bit later in this video
both g-sync and free sync provide the
key features of adaptive sync but due to
their differences in their
implementation there are some
differences in additional features
provided by edge technology as g-sync
monitors use a proprietary scaler module
most displays are limited to just
DisplayPort and HDMI connectivity with
only DisplayPort supporting adaptive
sync free sync on the other hand uses
standard display scaler so free sync
learners often have many more
connectivity options energies and
counterparts including multiple HDMI
ports and legacy connectors such as DVI
and even VGA free sync has another
connectivity advantage through a feature
called free sync over HDMI as the name
suggests amy has managed to get adaptive
sync working over standard HDMI
connectors and cables provided both the
GPU and monitors support the feature
there are a few benefits to running
adaptive sync over HDMI rather than
DisplayPort primarily the fact that HDMI
cables are much cheaper than DisplayPort
cables and devices with limited room for
ports such as laptops can use them more
widely adopted HDMI standard for
compatibility with other displays
without losing support for adaptive sync
proprietary module does give it some
advantages though g-sync continually
tweaks monitor overdrive on-the-fly to
eliminate ghosting wherever possible
which has been shown previously to
improve ghosting performance compared to
free sync displays driver and monitor
tweaks over the past two use have
improved freesync displays in this
regard though NVIDIA has integrated a
feature called ultra-low motion blur or
you LMB into every g-sync monitor as
well which strokes the backlight in sync
with the displays refresh rate to reduce
motion blur and improve clarity in high
motion situations the feature works at
high fixed refresh rates typically at or
above 85 Hertz though it does come with
a small brightness reduction the main
downside to you LMB is that it can't be
used in conjunction with g-sync in other
words you need to choose between
variable refresh rates without
stuttering and tearing or high clarity
and low motion work most people will
prefer to use g-sync for the smoothness
it provides what eSports enthusiasts
will love you LMB for its responsiveness
and clarity at the expense of tearing
again this is a feature that does not
have an equivalent in the free sync
implementation low framerate
compensation or LFC is another point of
difference between g-sync and free sync
every adaptive sync monitor has a
refresh rate window for example 30 to
144 Hertz within which the refresh rate
can dynamically adjust to the GPUs
render aid what happens between zero
Hertz and the displays minimum refresh
rate 30 Hertz in the case of my example
is determined by whether the monitor
supports LFC monitors that do support
LFC duplicate frames and refresh rates
when frame rates are below the displays
minimum to ensure variable refresh
continues to function below the minimum
for example when 20 FPS game player is
played on a 32 144 Hertz adaptive sync
monitor with LFC every frame is
duplicated and the monitor operates at
40 Hertz within its refresh window
monitors with that LSC would run at 30
Hertz with either staring or stuttering
depending on the precincts setting due
to it running at 20 fps and not 30
LFC is extremely important on monitors
with high minimum refresh rates such as
48 hurt
LLC on these sorts of models allows the
variable refresh window to extend into
the crucial 32 48 hurt zone and function
as if the monitor has no minimum refresh
rate with that LC on this monitors there
is a jarring effect when frame rates
fluctuate in the 40 to 55 FPS soon as
variable refresh if you continually
activating and deactivating at the 48
FPS boundary so LIC is crucial for the
best adaptive sync experience every
g-sync monitor comes with support for
LFC so when buying a g-sync display it's
not something you have to worry about
who think is a different story is only
some monitors mostly hi and monitors
support LLC you'll need to consult aim
these display lists to check whether a
free sync Mon on your radar supports LLC
whereas it's already a known quantity
with every g-sync display some of the
initial teething issues with both
adaptive sync technologies have been
resolved since its initial launch resync
works the same in both precinct and
gsync with vsync controls only affecting
how frames are displayed outside the
variable refresh window borderless
window gaming with adaptive sync is also
supported now by both free sync and
gsync although ambe's implementation
appears to be a bit dodgy in some
situations as for graphics card support
that remains the same it's both free
sync and gsync free sync requires a see
islands Radeon rx 200 series card from
2013 on newer while g-sync requires a
Kepler GeForce 600 series card from 2012
or newer g-sync doesn't work with AMD
graphics cards and free sing doesn't
work on Nvidia graphics cards as has
always been the case the main takeaway
from looking in range of juicing can
precinct displays is that G sync is a
known quantity whereas free sync bonus
vary significantly in quality basically
every GC quarter is a high-end unit with
gaming suitable features a large refresh
window support for LFC and you OMB in
other words when purchasing a do sync
monitor you can be sure you're getting
the best variable refresh experience and
a great monitor in general with free
sync some monitors the gaming focus with
high-end features and support for LFC
but many aren't and a more geared
towards everyday office usage than
gaming potential buyers will need to
research free sync modernism more than
a sink equivalents to ensure that
they're getting a good monitor with all
the features necessary for the best
variable refresh experience pricing is
one of the most contentious issues with
free sink versus GT as in video charges
a hefty premium for the use of their
proprietary module I've researched a
bunch of near-identical free sync and
gsync monitors to examine their price
differences and here are the results
looking at near identical miners from
the same manufacturer g-sync adds
exactly 200 US dollars in most cases to
the MSRP over the free sink model when
looking across brands the margin to me
as well as $100 but often hovers near
that same $200 mark for the six monitor
types I've researched the average price
difference when looking at the most
similar models was 188 dollars u.s. two
of the G sink models could be
overclocked using the on-screen display
beyond what the equivalent free sink
model was capable of which adds a bit of
value to the premium price you're paying
for the most part though you're only
getting the F mentioned benefits of G
sink like you LMB LFC and of course
adaptive sink compatibility with nvidia
graphics cards fruiting models are
universally cheaper though one of the
six monitors I examined the ASA h2 seven
7hk did not support LSC due to its
limited refresh rate windows new
adaptive sync monitors are set to hit
the market in the coming months which
harnessed some new additions to the free
sync and gsync ecosystems jisuk is
expanding its feature set to include
support for HDR monitors and wide color
gamut HDR learners with g-sync will
support all its key features like you
LMB and LFC though there will also
include far larger gammas and higher
brightness for HDR functionality drivers
will seamlessly switch between SDR
environments for desktop work and HDR in
support applications where appropriate
free sync to is a much larger update
that not only includes support for HDR
monitors but also introduces a monitor
of validation scheme they will see only
the best monitors given a precinct to
badge routing to minors worth at least
twice the maximum brightness and color
volume over standard srgb displays and
monitors will be validated to ensure
they meet input lag standards in
few millisecond range according to a and
D all 332 miles will also support LFC
freezing to will include similar
features to jisuk HJ as well like
support for larger gamut higher
brightness and automatic switching
between SDR and HDR modes there's still
no word on whether AMD will charge a
premium for free sync to validation and
branding though the updated technology
will bring through sync closer to what
Jessie provides in every monitor so
there's a lot of information to take in
about the differences between free sync
and gsync I still think most people be
making a purchasing decision for their
monitor based on the graphics card that
they have in their system course Ambu
users will buy free sync minors Nvidia
users will buy GCM owners but it's
always nice to know the differences
between the two ecosystems to know
exactly what you're getting and you know
it might influence some people's
purchasing decisions you never quite
know anyway that's it for this little
look at free sync and gsync again I hope
you guys learned something from this
video and we'll catch you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
