mentioned in a video last week we do now
have the penny mg 4560 processor on hand
and in that video last week we set out
to discover if this processor could
still run Windows 7 despite the lack of
official support for cable 8 processors
and as expected we found that yes it can
the pentium g 4560 features 2 cores with
hyper-threading support enabling 4
threads so essentially then it's a core
i3 processor which I have to admit is a
little confusing since we also have
cable 8 core i3 processors with 2 cores
and 4 threads the only difference being
at the pentium models are clocked a
little bit lower and use the base 3 mega
byte level 3 cache that's amazing news
for shoppers who had their eye on
something like the core i3 6100 because
the g4 560 cost just $72 us or $78 Ozzie
that's almost half the price is the I
360 188 percent discount for us Aziz the
G 4560 really does look to be the
bargain CP of 2017 that said you will
still run to heaps of online users
claiming things like the core i3 process
is a garbage for gaming their dual core
rubbish and so on I've always been a bit
miffed by this our own core i3 6100 T
test system which runs the sky like i
three processor clock adjust 3.2
gigahertz has always proven very capable
getting the most out of budget GPU such
as the RX 470 and gtx 1050 Ti personally
I think a lot of these comments have
come from people who invested in a Core
i5 or even Core i7 processor and don't
understand that not everyone can afford
to spend that kind of money on a gaming
PC whatever the case I do consistently
hear from actual core i3 owners about
how impressed they are with the
performance of their underrated
processes admittedly part of the problem
could also be us the reviewers generally
speaking we test CPU gaming performance
using the fastest possible GPU available
at lower resolutions than you would
typically game it and this is done in
order to remove the possibility of a GPU
bottle
which would shape the results this is
great for showing just how much faster
or say a core i7 processor is than a
core i3 processor under extreme gaming
conditions however as a result it can
make the core i3 processor look
significantly slower in comparison than
say it would under more realistic
conditions even though the extreme
example just given the core i3 might
still enable playable performance the
fact that it appears so much slower than
the core i7 that leads many to jump to
the conclusion that it's not suitable
for gaming to get the full picture I
feel you really need to test CPU gaming
performance with a number of different
tiered GPUs so for this video I would
benchmarking the G 4560 along with a few
other processors using the gtx 750ti
gtx 1060 and gtx 1080 at both 1080p and
1440p this will give those sensible
folks pairing a budget cpu with the
budget GPU a real idea of what to expect
meanwhile by including the gtx 1080 you
can see what kind of performance a
faster processor might enable should you
have the GPU power to take advantage of
it
please note jus the limited pixel real
estate I have been restricted to the
number of CPUs I can compare in a single
graph before it becomes an
incomprehensible mess so while I have
included core i3 i5 and i7 processors
I'm sure there's an additional processor
or processors you would like to have
seen included so for now these samples
will have to do but depending on demand
I could create a follow-up video
featuring other processes so feel free
to drop your requests below in the
comments section anyway with all that in
mind let's jump to the results first
that we have a rise of the Tomb Raider
an action-adventure title it isn't
particularly CPU demanding as a result
the G 4560 had no trouble maxing out for
1050 TI and 1060 at 1080p delivering the
exact same experiences are more
expensive processes including the core
i7 6700k
increasing the rendering power with the
gtx 1080 so the average frame rate
increased dramatically though the
minimum frame rate when paired with the
Pentium processor remained much the same
this resulted in occasional stuttering
and overall I found the experience with
the G 4560 better using the gtx 1060
than i did with the gtx 1080 so that was
interesting
bumping the resolution up to 1440p we
again find the same experience with the
gtx 1050 TI and gtx 1060 while all four
processors tested also delivered similar
numbers with the GTA
ten eighty now without quite the same
significant variance between the minimum
average frame rates the gaming
experience when using the G forty five
sixty was comparable to that of the
sixty seven hundred K Far Cry primal is
another game it isn't particularly CPU
demanding testing at 1080p shows similar
performance across the board when using
the GTX 1050 Ti and 1060 moving to the
GTX now we see that it's really only the
Core i5 and core i7 processors that can
push this high-end graphics card to its
full potential at 1080p that said moving
the 1440p the only thing slowing the G
4560 down is that 3.5 gigahertz
operating frequency as the 4.2 gigahertz
7350 K is able to keep pace with the i5
and i7 models even when using the GTX
1080 that said the game was still very
playable on the G 45 16 we didn't notice
any kind of stuttering issues at 1440p
Tom Clancy's the division was tested
using the low level Dex 12 API and this
should help out the lower end processors
despite testing a very demanding section
of the game where frame rates are pushed
quite a lot of times the G 45 60s seemed
to hang in there performance was much
the same with the gtx 750ti while the
pentium processor was just 9% slower
than the 67 or ok with the gtx 1060
increasing the resolution of 1440 p
evened up the 1052 our results and now
the g 45 60 was just 4% slower than the
67 ok when paired with the 1060 as you
might expect the budget dual-core
processor wasn't able to extract the
full potential from the GTX 1080 and
here the minimum frame rate was 19%
level and compared to the 6700k result
hitman was also tested using DirectX 12
and here the g 45 60 was able to max out
the gtx 1050 TI
at 1080p it sells slightly behind the
gtx 1060 trailing the fastest tested
cpus by a 12 percent margin the
transient processor was pretty much
maxed out with the 1060 as we saw a
little improvement with the 1080 moving
the 1440p the g 45 16 matched the other
three processes when using the gtx 1060
but again fell well behind with the gtx
1080
the minimum frame rate was 20% lower
when compared to the 6700 K and the
average frame rate was 30% lower quantum
break is another game that isn't very
CPU demanding at least in our test and
here the G 45 60 was able to max out the
gtx 1050 TI that said with the gtx 1060
handling the rendering work it was 14%
slower than the 73 50k when comparing
the minimum frame rate despite matching
the average frame rate of even the 6700
K the GTX canady performance was also
very respectable and here the Pentium
processor never dipped below 90 frames
per second increasing the resolution of
1440 P so the G 4560 hang in there with
the big guns
even with the GT x 1080 installed our
overwatch BOTS match test does use all
eight threads of a 67 ok so needless to
say this is a very CPU intensive
benchmark nonetheless the g40 560 push
the gtx 750ti to its limit which meant
frame rates never dropped below 90 fps
the Pentium processor also handled the
GTX 1060 quite well and it was the
minimum frame rate that was most
impressive here as we've seen time and
time again at IEP the GTX a proved too
much for the budget dual-core processor
increasing the resolution of 1440 P led
the g45 60 to match the i3 i5 and i7
processors when paired with the gtx 1060
again it was only when we whipped out
the gtx 1080 the pentium was exposed as
the weaker processor dooms low-level
Vulkan API let's the G 45 60 off the
hook and shockingly even at 1080p this
affordable processor is almost able to
push the mighty GTX 280 to the 200 FPS
cap needless to say it had no trouble
getting the most out of the gtx 1060 and
1050 Ti moving to 1440p we see the dual
core Pentium hangs in there with the
other processes delivering similar
performance even with the GTX 280 total
we'll warhammer might offer low-level
API support but this strategy game is
still a seriously heavy CPU user due to
the vast amount of Units present when
heading into battle the G 45 60 does
well when paired with the gtx 1050 TI
but falls well behind the eight ball
once we ramp up the rendering power with
the GTX 1060 here at trailed the core i3
70 350 K by a 24% margin and the 6700 K
by study 9% that's of the game while
still playable but you would be wasting
a heap of money here as there was a heap
of untapped performance placing
additional load on the GPU by moving to
1440p helped out the pentium process a
little they still trailed quite a bit
with the GTX 1060 when comparing the
minimum frame rates Mirror's Edge
catalyst is surprisingly hard on the CPU
although the G 45 60 was able to
max out the GTX 1050 I came up short
with the GTX 1060 as the minimum frame
rate fell away by the time we reached
the GTX today the Pentium and Core i3
processors were miles behind the i5 and
i7 models bumping up the resolution or
1440p helps when paired with the GTX
1060 now the G 4560 was comparable to
even the 6700 kf1 2016 is another
surprisingly CPU demanding game as we've
seen time and time again the g 45 60 is
able to extract a maximum performance
from the gtx 750ti however it does start
to fall behind when paired with the 1060
and well behind with the 1080 at 1080p
it was 25% slower than the core i3 73
50k with a minimum frame rate of just 36
FPS which is essentially the same result
it managed with the 1050 Ti even at
1440p the G 45 60 isn't able to get the
most out of the gtx 1060 and falls well
behind the core i5 and i7 processors
Deus Ex mankind divided is another game
that is surprisingly CPU demanding
although the G 45 60 was able to get the
most out of the GTX 1050 TI it started
to fall behind with b10 60 and well
behind with the 1080 the 1440p
resolution helped the G 45 60 catch up
when paired with the GTX 1060 though was
still well behind with the GTX 1080 at
least when comparing the minimum frame
rates the battlefield 1 is possibly the
most significant title we're testing
with and not just because it's usually
popular the game is a cpu killer and has
had many core i5 owners scrambling for
an upgrade before you get the mega phone
out shouting we need to test the
multiplayer portion of the game hear me
out
firstly and very importantly accurately
testing multiplayer performance is near
on impossible for a single test you can
get an idea of what a system is capable
of but then for comparing it to
something else it's just not practical
secondly the section of the
single-player campaign that we use for
testing is extremely CPU intensive in
fact it replicates the multiplayer CPU
usage to a tee so the numbers I'm about
to show you should be true for the
multiplayer portion of the game as well
at 1080p the g45 60 provided a similar
experience to the higher-end processors
when compared to the gtx 750ti
it does start to fall away quite a bit
with the gtx 960m ends up miles behind
with the GTX 1080
something that I found odd was the fact
the G 45 60 and 70 350 K actually hit
lower minimums with the G
to X 1080 than they did with the GTX
1060 in this title that doesn't seem
possible but these results are based on
an average of six runs and the GTX 980
consistently saw lower minimum us with
these dual core processors moving up to
1440p the G 4560 does well again with
the GTX 1050 - I'm not too bad with the
1060 this time mafia three is quite
demanding on the CPU though it's also
very much a GPU Pig as well the G 4560
once again was able to max out the gtx
750ti but falls well behind when using
the gtx 1060 here at 1440p the Pentium
processor doesn't do too poorly with the
gtx 1060 but of course does fall behind
the core i5 and i7 processors with the
GT x 1080 handling the rendering work
Gears of War 4 is again that loves to
gobble up cores and here we see the
result of that the G 45 60 does well
with the gtx 750ti in charge but once we
move to the 1060 it starts to fall
behind upping the resolution or 1440p l
as the pentium processor and the 73 50k
to keep pace with the i5 and i7
processors when using the gtx 1060
though they do fall behind once again
when running the GTX 1080 back when I
first tested titanfall 2's GPU and CPU
Robert I found the game wasn't at all
demanding especially on the CPU this was
true for both the single and multiplayer
portions of the game the single player
pushed utilization to around 25% with
our core i7 6700k processor while
multiplayer only hit as high as 35% as a
result you can see that even at 1080p
the G 4560 is able to extract maximum
performance from the gtx 1060 and 1080
graphics cards that being the case we
find the exact same thing it's 1440p so
not much to see here then civilization 6
is the complete polar opposite to
titanfall 2 and that probably isn't
surprising as they are in no way similar
games like most bird's eye-view strategy
games civilization 6 is extremely cpu
demanding even with the gtx 1050 TI we
see the g 4560 dropping a few frames
behind the core i5 and i7 processors and
this is something we haven't seen in any
other game yet as a result with the gtx
1060 installed the g 4560 falls well
behind even the 73 50k here it was 21%
slower and almost 30% slower than the
core i5 7600 k oddly moving the 1440p
the margins actually increased with the
gtx 1050
ETI and frankly I don't really know how
to explain this in any case this is
clearly a game that requires at least a
core i5 processor to get the most out of
it when it comes to seafood utilization
Call of Duty infinite warfare is very
similar to titanfall 2 and when testing
the core i7 6700k we found that CPU
utilization hovered around 30% in both
the single-player and multiplayer
portions of the game so as you might
have expected even at 1080p the G 4560
is able to hang in there with the big
boys even with the GT X 1080 installs
moving the 1440p further cements this
and here the pentium processor was
indistinguishable to the core i5 and
core i7 processors ok so that covers all
the benchmark results and how to make
sense of it all there are a few ways we
could go about this and the way I've
decided to do it is select all the CPU
demanding games then compare the minimum
results and show the average figures in
a single graph so for now let's drop the
non demanding titles which includes
titanfall 2 Call of Duty infinite
warfare Far Cry primal rise of the Tomb
Raider quantum break and doom
that leaves us eleven games that were
CPU demanding and show noticeable
performance drop offs with the gtx 1060
and GG x 1080 when looking at the
minimum frame rates so here we have it
the average minimum frame rate for the
CPU demanding titles as you can see the
penny mg 45 60 is able to extract the
maximum performance from the gtx 750ti
of course it won't surprise many of you
that a budget CPU is the perfect pairing
for a budget GPU stepping up to the gtx
1060 we did find mixed results and if we
focus on the CPU demanding titles we see
that the g 45 60 was 21% slower than the
core i7 6700k and 17% slower than the
7600 k it also trailed the 7350 k by 10%
margin which is a bad given it's clocked
18% lower as you can see the G 45 60 was
pretty much tapped out with the 1060
and we only see a 2 FPS boost when
moving to the 1080 whereas the 67 ok was
27% fast and the G 45 60 when gaming
with the GTX 1060 it's a whopping 87%
faster with the GTX 1080 so if we only
tested with the GTX 1080 at 1080p it
would be easy to assume that gamers
really need a Core i7 processor
bumping the resolution up to 1440p
reduce the
margins quite dramatically whereas a
6700k was 27 percent faster than g 4560
with the gtx 1060 it's now just 18%
faster of course those running a high
end GPU such as the gtx 10a will still
want a Core i5 or Core i7 processor so
for that vocal minority that lost their
minds when I started testing low-end
graphics cards such as the GTX 1050
series and the rx 460 and rx 470
graphics cards using our core i3 test
rig you can now see why this wasn't such
a big deal for the vast majority of
gamers the core i3 can get the most out
of these low-end graphics cards or
entry-level graphics cards and it does a
much better job of representing
real-world performance than a three
hundred and forty dollar US core i7
processor does but anyway that's
probably a discussion for another time
something I noticed how quite
interesting during this extensive test
was when and where stuttering reared its
ugly head
for the most part I only noticed
stuttering when using the GTX 1080 on
the dual-core processors this could be
seeing the results when testing
benchmarking the G 4560 with the GTX
1050 TI for example the results from the
three runs were all very much the same
this was also true with the GTX 1060
configuration for the most part the
gameplay was smooth and consistent with
no stuttering then with the GTX 1080
the minimum frame rates are all over the
place in most of the games tested and in
an effort to improve accuracy some games
to run half a dozen times
so again if we're only benchmarks with a
high end GPU such as the GTX 980 this
would lead me to believe that the G 45
60 is more prone to stuttering in
addition to benchmarking I did spend
quite a bit of time playing the games
tested with the G 45 60 and gtx 750ti
combo and found the experience
surprisingly satisfying at 1080p again
absolutely no stuttering at all was seen
in any of the games tested with the gtx
750ti
some low-level times were a bit extreme
I think the division was the worst but
other than that it was smooth sailing
with the G 45 60 the G 45 60 is by far
the best processor to come out of this
whole KB Lakes flash skylake refresh and
shockingly it's not a processor intel
sent to reviewers that said as good as
it is Intel could have just said you
know what guys we're taking this one off
here you have a $72 core i3 6100 and
we'll call it a day
that probably wouldn't have sat too well
with OEMs trying to flog the pcs based
on what is meant to be the lasing race
technology so voila we have the seventh
gen series well that about wraps this
one up I just like to quickly say a big
thank you to all of you who watch the
channel with your ad blocker disabled
and use the Amazon affiliate links in
the video description it really helps me
out and it enables me to invest the time
it takes to create the video comparison
such as this one and also for those of
you who would like to see similar
comparisons with a combination of
different CPUs or maybe the G 4560
compared to other CPUs then let me know
about in the comments below and I'll see
what I can do about making that happen
I'm your host Steve and I'll catch you
