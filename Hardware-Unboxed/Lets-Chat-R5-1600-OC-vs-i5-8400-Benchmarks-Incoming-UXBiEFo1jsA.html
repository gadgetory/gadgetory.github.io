so on October 18th I put together a
fairly comprehensive set of gaming
benchmarks covering a wide range of new
intel core i7 and core i5 processors and
compared them to the AMD arisin range in
total nine games were tested at 720p
1080p and 1440p using the second highest
quality preset with a Radeon rx and Vega
64 liquid-cooled graphics card the focus
of that video was stock out-of-the-box
performance but I noted that I also
planned to create an overclocking
version as well so far I have the
numbers for the rising 5 1600 though I
thought rather than delay showing them
to you for another week or two let's
compare the r5 1600 at 4 gigahertz to
the core i5 8400 I've been getting
dozens of requests every day to make
this comparison so I thought I'd make it
happen sooner rather than later
however the video with all the benchmark
results will be coming this time
tomorrow today I want to discuss a few
things that came up in the previous
video and will no doubt come up again in
tomorrow's video so rather than address
all those comments individually let's
just discuss them here and then I can
skip this explanation at least out of
tomorrow's benchmark video and just get
on with all the benchmarks anyone who
makes a comment about the topics or
things covered in this video
tomorrow will be linked back to this
video so hello person complaining about
720p testing
ok so first let's talk about the
graphics card choice the Radeon rx Vegas
64 liquid-cooled has been used because
it offers true DirectX 12 support and
gives us a much better idea of how these
multi-core CPUs will perform in modern
titles using DirectX 12 meanwhile the
GTX 1080i it does rely on driver
trickery to offer DirectX 12 support and
therefore doesn't take full or proper
advantage of the more modern API since
we aren't using ultra type settings and
almost all the games tested and I am
showing 720p results Vegas 64
liquid-cooled isn't the bottleneck that
many made it out to be in the previous
video in fact it's faster than the GTX
1080i in the DirectX 12 titles test and
the results in most of the DirectX
and holes aren't that different
especially 720p the margins certainly
are very similar between the CPUs tested
perhaps the biggest point of contention
though was the 720p testing which was
included to help remove the graphics
card as a potential bottleneck pro tip
for other tech channels if you want to
weed out toxic AMD fanboys include 720p
testing in all your videos and be
prepared to play whack-a-mole with
YouTube's ban feature
seriously though low resolution testing
really is the only way to truly
determine what kind of difference the
CPU makes when it comes to gaming that
said though it's not like I only
included 720p results reading some of
the comments on that video you would
certainly think that was the case but no
it wasn't just as much focus was placed
on the 1080p and 1440p testing by the
time you get to 1440p though you really
no longer testing CPU performance for
the most part it's really a GPU
benchmark then but still I include the
1440p results to satisfy those that
request it and I really don't have a
problem with providing a broader range
of data when I can basically anyone in
the comment section I'm berserk over
either the 720p or 1440p results being
included pretty much has an agenda in my
opinion there really is no valid reason
to demand that certain datasets be
excluded the more information we have
the better I'll cover the low resolution
topic in more detail with benchmarks
very soon for now though I don't see how
this information is misleading or hurts
anyone anyone commenting that it is
misleading or useless because no one
plays at 720p
sadly doesn't get why reviewers test at
low resolutions for CPU benchmarks again
if 720p testing is provided alongside
1080p and even 1440p testing then
frankly you don't have a leg to stand on
alright moving on to the next issue the
core i5 8400 and here I want to talk
about budget motherboards enhanced
multi-core support and pricing first up
cheap motherboards next year we're
expecting sub $100 u.s. 300 series
motherboards are supporting say the H
370 and B 360 chipsets to arrive and
this will drastically reduce the cost
per frame of the
I 580 400 and my little charts at the
end of the videos that I do then this
will make it a better value product and
likely give AMD a few more headaches in
the process looking at the comment
section of the previous video it seems
that AMD fans seem to be arguing that
the core i5 8400 will be slower on the
more budget orientated 300 series
motherboards with these new affordable
chipsets that I just spoke of and I'm
not really sure why that is we've
certainly never seen this in the past
the core i7 77 okay for example delivers
the exact same performance out of the
box on a h1 10 board as it does as n270
that is a core streaming that you keep
the memory speed at ddr4 2133 on this
end through 70 board but yeah
performance doesn't change for the
chipsets between the chipsets why why is
that a new thing now there are a few
things to discuss here and all of them
were a counter form our core i5 8400
review officially the 8400 supports ddr4
2666 memory and this is the maximum
memory speed that will be supported on
motherboards that don't feature
overclocking support so that means B 360
and H 370 boards all of the core i5 8400
results that I've shown so far were
gathered using ddr4 3200 memory so in
CPU bound scenarios the 8400 will be
slower on cheaper motherboards using
ddr4 2666 memory it won't be drastically
slower but it will be slower all the
same getting back to the AMD fans they
also claimed that the base clock speed
of the 8400 is suspicious and Intel is
pulling some kind of shifty move here
it's been suggested that intel has
hand-picked the review samples and while
they can maintain a 3.8 gigahertz all
core operating frequency beyond the
review sample chips that is under load
the retail chips they're saying at least
the bad ones will drop down to the 2.8
gigahertz base frequency and therefore
will step to a 26% reduction in
performance compared to the figures I
showed in my review and the previous big
benchmark video well I've bought a
retail chip and the results were
identical to the Intel sample Brian over
at Tech your city bought two chips not
one but two hey bought one locally and
one from
us and they were also exactly the same
as my Intel sample as I understand it
the reason the Intel Core i5 8400 has
such a low base clock frequency is
because of its 65 watt TDP rating for
gaming and typical workloads it can stay
within the power profile with all six
cores at 3.8 gigahertz however it can't
achieve this for avx2 workloads and
therefore it has to drop down to 2.8
gigahertz to stay within the power spec
the 8600 K on the other hand has been
branded with a 95 watt TDP rating and
therefore can maintain a higher base
frequency for avx2 workloads 3600 K
doesn't come with a cooler so Intel can
get away with making in a higher TDP
part if they did this with the 8400 that
have to spend more money on providing a
better cooler and we know they're
opposed to that idea and really Intel
just doesn't like cutting into profit
margins as for my testing with the core
i5 8400 well I used a Zed 370
motherboard
there's simply no other choice right now
for those buying this CPU for either
using it or reviewing it that being the
case I factored the cost of the Zed 370
motherboard into my cost per frame
analysis if you're gonna buy an 8400
with a Zen 370 motherboard which as I
said you have two right now then you're
not going to limit yourself to ddr4 2666
memory so for now that data is
irrelevant despite using a Zed 370 board
I haven't been able to enable the
enhanced multi-core feature on any of
the asrock MSI or gigabyte boards that
I've tested people have told me you can
do this on a seuss boards and that it's
enabled by default I'm not sure if
that's true or not I think it's possible
they might be getting a bit confused
though this is certainly the case for
unlocked K models but I haven't seen it
confirmed by reliable source for non K
locked models of course it could be
possible I just don't know yet as I
don't have an Isuzu 370 board yet anyway
my testing hasn't been done with
enhanced multi-core enabled in fact I've
actually never enabled this feature for
any of my CPU testing unless it was
specified and this has been the case for
years now I've always made sure it's
disabled before testing but as I said in
the case of the 8400 this feature isn't
even available in the BIOS to be enabled
finally pricing now reviewers like
myself typically base pricing on the
MSRP as this is generally the most
accurate pricing metric there is there
are certainly very little point in
taking sale prices into account as they
generally only be offered for a limited
time and they are very regional specific
so ya don't really make sense to use
those I know guys like oh the rosin five
1600s this price your pricing metrics
all out of whack it's like well yeah I I
will go off current market prices so
wait for the horizon five six five
hundred most of the rise and five
process is in that previous video I
actually use prices that were below the
MSRP but yeah they weren't micro center
prices where they're selling the risin 5
1604 $18.55 bitter sarcasm there right
now the core i5 8400 can't be had
anywhere near the $182 MSRP in time
you'll no doubt be able to get it for
that price but right now you just simply
can't in fact you probably can't get one
at all so pricing comparisons are based
on the MSRP but I do note the current
market price and conditions there's no
double standards here either I reviewed
the Radeon rx Vega 56 graphics card with
the MSRP and mind shortly after release
it was selling for more like I think it
was $700 u.s. not the $400 US MSRP that
said for follow up content I still based
everything on the MSRP but noted that
availability and current market prices
were great today it still is overpriced
but it has come down a long way and now
can be purchased for four hundred and
seventy dollars and I'm hoping that
early next year will be at the four
hundred dollar MSRP so people watching
that video next year you know won't be
getting a skewed opinion on a price that
no longer exists pricing certainly can
be very volatile we see this all the
time but the manufacturer's suggested
retail price well it's a real thing and
under typical market conditions that is
the price you'll be faced with as always
you do have to apply a little bit of
common sense and be a bit realistic
about all this some we can't base
pricing comparisons on the current
retail price in every region and really
we shouldn't have to these prices do
change regularly as I've seen they can
be quite volatile and
this is particularly true when a product
has just been released all that being
said it is my opinion that Intel has
screwed up this release or at least
rushed yet another release which has
caused problems and it hasn't gone as
well as should have so yeah not arguing
that at all or debating it I completely
agree with anyone who believes that
they're clearly feeling the heat from
Verizon and they've acted quickly as
quickly as possible and this has been
the result it's a bit of a messy release
anyway that's gonna do it for this one I
suspect there will be still people
ranting about low resolution testing in
the comment section below and all that
but I've now said my bit on the subject
for now I'm your host Steve say again
soon guys
