i'm your host Matt and today we've got
the first exclusive look at AMD's radeon
r9 390 x when AMD launched its new
radeon HD 7970 we're all impressed with
the old new gcn architecture and its
performance almost two years later AMD
re-released the HD 7970 rebadged as the
r9 280x it did have GCM 1.1 but
unfortunately performs was pretty much
the same a year after that we saw the
final are 9 200 series card the r9 285
with GCM 1.2 again performance failed to
impress GCM 1.2 would offered no real
performance advantages over the first
two versions and here we are three and a
half years down the track to discover
they've done it again the 300 series are
just the same rebadged GPUs with
slightly improved specs the y r9 390 x
is the r9 290x with twice the memory
buffer now 8 gigabytes which is frankly
unnecessary and slightly higher core and
memory clock speeds we suspect that
again this isn't going to translate to
any sort of significant performance
boost we don't see how it could so
there's one thing left to do let's take
it to the lab and find out in Crysis 3
the 398 to produce 39 frames per second
five frames higher than the 290x and
just a single frame behind the gtx 980
in battlefield hardline we saw the 390 x
got a smooth 62 frames per second for
more than the 290x and 3 less than the
gtx 980 in dying light the 390 x gave us
a playable 45 frames just three more
than the 290x and for less than the gtx
980 in GTA 5 the 390 x produced an
average of 62 frames which was again
just three frames more than the 290
and for less than the gtx 280 finally in
Metro redux the 390 X gave is 43 frames
per second this was for friends more
than the true 90 x + 7 less than the gtx
980 as you can see the 390 x performance
results and nothing to write home about
when compared to its predecessor with
the big aspect change being the extra 4
gigabytes of memory buffer this didn't
translate to any significant performance
increased as suspected just nine percent
over the previous 290x this sounds okay
but you have to keep in mind you can
probably close that gap and if not
easily have that gap by overclocking the
r9 290x and that the 290x and 390 acts
are going to have the same overclocking
limitations price-wise at the moment AMD
is recommending 429 US dollars for the
09 3 90 x meanwhile the 290x can be had
between 300 and 350 us and that are 8
you goodbye models floating around for
380 us where we do think the r9 390 X
does represent some values when compared
to the GeForce GTX 980 I 429 dollars
it's around fifty percent cheaper than
the GeForce GTX 980 the others
performance is only about seven percent
slower in our tests this has been Matt
from harbor unboxed we hope you've
enjoyed this first exclusive look at AMD
r9 390 X let me know what you think in

online 300 series videos see you next
