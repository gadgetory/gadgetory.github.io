decided to put together a quick video
for you guys checking out the latest
installment in the f1 racing series by
Codemasters it was released just a few
days ago now and it gives f1 fans a
chance to try out the new cars and of
course circuits like previous versions F
1 2017 has been built upon the same ego
4.0 game engine but the graphics have
been improved AMD and NVIDIA have both
recently released updated display
drivers to better support f1 2017 and
with the arrival of the Radeon rx Vega
56 I thought why not give a quick
comparison between it and the gtx 1070
this thing will be a similar format to
our what does it take to play series but
of course with a different objective for
testing we'll be looking at the 1080p
1440p and 4k resolutions I'll also be
taking a quick look at how the
performance between f1 2016 and f1 2017
compares AMD enjoyed a slight
performance edge in the 2016 version and
while it is only early days I'm keen to
see how they stack up in this latest
2017 version just finally please note
that all the testing was conducted using
the ultra quality preset on our core i7
7700 K test system before we take a look
at a few graphs here is how the gtx 1070
and RX vega 56 GPUs compare side-by-side
please note that these runs are not
identical but they're certainly very
close and I'll be showing you a minutes
worth of gameplay footage
okay so things look pretty even at 1440p
based on what we just saw there and as
you can see here based on an average of
three runs the GTX 1070 the MSI gaming X
version mind you came out just a single
frame faster on average that said the
GTX 1070 was a good bit faster at 1080p
and it did maintain a much better 1% low
result for the 4k testing so 1440p is
certainly a best-case scenario for AMD
right now what's interesting though is
if we look back to f1 2016 which is
built upon the same game engine Vega 56
is noticeably faster at both 1080p and
1440p though it does again choke at 4k
when it comes to those 1% lows what's
also interesting to note is that the gtx
1070 is faster in f1 2017 when compared
to f1 2016 so that isn't certainly very
interesting while the opposite is true
for Vega 56 so I do wonder if this is
yet another title where aimday have some
driver work to do before we can see them
most from Vega overall f1 2017 looks
really good I just wish I had a bit more
time to invest in the career mode but
that was pretty much the case with f1
2016 I ended up spending significantly
more time benchmarking that game than
actually playing but thankfully I do
enjoy that also on that note you can
expect plenty of f1 2017 benchmark
action in my upcoming videos anyway I
hope you guys enjoyed this quick
comparison I'm your host Steve I'll
catch you again soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
