I'm shifting focus a little bit after a
few weeks of testing monitors non-stop
because I think it was a couple of weeks
ago now that Intel launched a new
collection of ninth generation eighth
series processes for gaming and high
performance laptops so then of course
means we need to revisit laptops to see
how these new chips stack up Intel's the
last couple of product lines have been a
bit confusing with multiple code names
and architectures but across different
series current you series chips for
ultra portable laptops are still branded
as 8th gen and a codenamed whiskey Lake
while these h-series chips get a bump up
to ninth gen and form part of coffee
like refresh the same as current desktop
CPUs most of Intel's nitrogen laptop
parts aren't particularly exciting and
don't add much new to the table the core
i5s
are still four core eight thread parts
and the cry sevens are still six core
twelve thread models we're still on 40
nanometers with whatever number of
pluses were up to now the IG GPU is also
the same not that anyone cares much
about that in this sort of form factor
that's typically paired with it discrete
GPU where the improvements are coming
depends on the CPU for the cry 5 models
we're getting very modest clock speed
jobs the 9300 H is just 100 megahertz
higher for its base and boost clock
while the 9400 H doesn't even get a base
clock increase just an additional
hundred megahertz increase to the boost
meanwhile the level 3 cache of 8
megabytes stays the same for the core
i7s we do get a cache increase from nine
megabytes 12 mega bytes and the 9750 h
has received the biggest clock jump
relative to the 8750 h it goes from a
2.2 gigahertz base and 4.1 gigahertz
boost to a 2.6 key hurt space and 4.5
gigahertz boost so that's a 400
megahertz increase across the board the
9850 H is more modest again with no base
coat gain and 300 megahertz extra on the
boost given the 8750 aja now the 9750 h
are the most commonly used H series
processors especially for the majority
of gaming notebooks I do find this
specification breakdowns interesting the
new 758 sits a lot closer to the 9850 H
then the corresponding 8th gen parts and
the 9750 H is the only chip to get
between 10 and
20% clock speed increases it looks like
Intel is targeted gains for this CPU
specifically knowing how popular it is
to ensure that at least some nice gen
parts deliver actual performance
increases and then of course where I
haven't talked about yet other new core
on nine models which are indeed eight
cores and 16 threads to match the top
end core oh nine desktop models the I
999 a thk can even reach 5 gigahertz
like the 9900 K within a 45 watt TDP
supposedly these eight core core i knows
replace the single 8th gen core i 9
which restore 6 core patches with higher
clocks while it is interesting to see
eight core cpus come to laptops in
acclaimed 45 watt TDP until do state
they're targeting muscle books with
these chips of course Intel just made up
muscle books as a product category for
this cpu launch but basically it means
those super chunky beast gaming laptops
rather than the more mid tier or slim
offerings that most people buy this
leaves the quinine is more a niche CP
rather than an 8 core laptop CPU
accessible to all as you might have seen
from the title of this video the focus
today is on the core i7 9 750 H which is
the new mainstream H series laptop
processor there will be seen in many
many gaming laptops outside of the 8
core ones it's probably the most
exciting chip as well given the larger
than usual clock speed increases and its
widespread use specifically I want to
focus on the difference between the 9
750 H and the 8750 H given I think this
would be on the mind of most buyers
looking at grabbing a new laptop
especially with the staggered releases
between Nvidia on the GPU side and Intel
the CPU side many laptops are available
with the same GPU inside but a choice
between the 9 750 X or the a 750 H a
final word on the spec stuff before
digging into some performance stuff a
notice has been dragged down a little
bit but there is a lot to get through
Intel does list the maximum turbo clock
for the 9 750 H at 4.5 gigahertz
although this only applies to a single
core with two cores active it drops down
to four point four gigahertz then it
follows down in a hundred megahertz
increments for each additional active
core down to four gigahertz
for six cores active this differs again
from the 87 58 which allows 4.1
gigahertz on two cores 4 gigahertz and
up to 4 cores then 3.9 gigahertz on 6
cores so when the 9750 H is fully
utilized on 6 cores it's Matt
turbo clock does end up only 100
megahertz higher than the 8750 H this is
also something to keep in mind and shows
that a good portion of intel's
improvements here have targeted single
or low core count usage for testing the
cryo 790 750 h i received two laptops
one from gigabyte and the other from msi
the gigabyte model is the Auris 15 which
features a new 240 hertz display but is
a little loud on the cooler side with
some what an annoying
kula noise profile the msi option is the
GE 75 Raider a larger 17-inch machine
both occupy that sort of mid size mid
tier option in the market so it's nice
and refreshing not to test a cooling
restricted slim in life for the first
time around here for other hardware both
are equipped with the NVIDIA GeForce
artex 2070 laptop GPU so that's the full
laptop variant not max-q also getting 16
gigabytes of dual-channel ddr2 NT 666
which is the maximum speed there's 9 758
supports again no movement with these
new cps towards supporting higher
frequencies
both are 1080p displays as well and fast
nvme SSDs the first thing I want to
explore and this is crucial for the rest
of the performance section are power
limits and clock speeds laptops are a
highly restricted form factor so even if
Intel gives the CPU the option to run it
up to 4 gigahertz across 6 cause power
limits will almost always prevent the
CPU from actually hitting those clocks
in long term workloads unlike with fully
unleashed desktop systems what we've
seen over the last few years with
Intel's H series products is that OMS
tend to ignore the actual TDP ratings in
favour of higher PL 1 and PL 2 limits
which pushes up clock speeds with quad
core Core i7 7700 HQ laptops we
typically saw PL 1 or the longer-term
turbo limit sitting around 45 watts with
the eye 78758
in many laptops that jumped up to 52
watt so thereabouts which is notably
higher than the actual 45 watt TDP with
time limits removed as well I'm not
going to get into the whole TDP argument
about whether this is in spec or out of
spec behavior but at the end of the day
om spelt that they could handle the new
six core CPUs in their designs with a
higher power limit and to achieve better
performance they allowed it and with the
i7 9750 H we're again seeing around a 52
appeal to limit or
though in the MSI more lives a little
higher at around 54 watts not a big
difference there though PL - limits have
also increased a bit to allow the higher
short-term turbo frequencies my i7 9750
H test laptops were configured to 80
watts compared to 70 watts for a typical
8750 H but the real story here is that
PL one limit given the 9 750 H is
basically the same architecture built on
the same process node with the same core
configuration we can't really be
expecting higher real-world clock speeds
within the same power limit and that's
basically what we get in terms of actual
clock speeds the cry 78750 HD mike
gigabyte arrow 15 X 9 sits around 3.1
gigahertz long term in a Cinebench r20
run after initially hitting three point
three gigahertz the cry 797 58 in my
gigabyte Rs 15
sits around 3.1 gigahertz long term in a
center bench our 20 run after initially
hitting three point three gigahertz
so in other words identical behavior so
when we look at Cinebench our 20
performance lo and behold both systems
perform roughly the same in the
multi-threaded test the MSI model does
clock slightly high and therefore
performs slightly better but not
considerably so the simple fact is it
takes more than simply increasing clock
speeds on paper to achieve a real-world
performance improvement when every other
aspect of the CPU remains the same
including its power limitations and this
is what we'll see throughout these
performance charts here's another one
for Cinebench r15 with a much wider
range of systems in the charts the MSI
model performs well in the
multi-threaded test but crucially it's
not the fastest system and actually gets
beaten by an a su slap top with the AI
78758 inside the gigabyte laurel is more
middle of the pack it's not slow but
it's nothing really special it is a
little more favorable to the msi model
in the single threaded test where it
clocks in 13% faster than the average
Cry 78758 result that's those higher
single coil clocks coming to play in
x264 encoding the core i7 9750 h laptops
do perform well in pass 1 but the
gigabyte system falls back to the pack
in the second pass the msi model is
outright fastest but is only very
slightly ahead of the well performing a
sous models to the tune of just 1% know
exactly the upgrade some would be
wanting here
handbrake is similar this is a long test
that falls almost entirely under the
pl-1 limit and again the MSI model
performs well but it's not the outright
fastest system and gets beaten by to a
seuss high 78758 models the Auris 15 is
no faster than gigabytes error of 15 X 9
my premier benchmark with lumetri
effects while it does utilize the GPU
somewhat become CPU limited after you're
running at GTX 1060 or so so once again
we're in a situation where the MSI model
is not the fastest but performs well
while the gigabyte model is no different
to most typical core 78758 laptops
you've probably seen a chart like this
the previous few times Adobe Photoshop
with the CPU limited iris blur effect is
a good showing for the 9 750 HP isn't
ultimately faster than the a 750 H
finally we see something slightly
different in 7-zip the two core i7 97 58
laptops sit atop the charts but only
just the gigabyte model is only 1%
faster than the fastest 8750 H laptop
while the MSI model fares a little
better slowly in 4% faster not
earth-shattering margins and unlikely to
sway anyone to ninth gen system MATLAB
doesn't benefit from the core i7 97 58
over the core i7 8750 H same performance
depending on which two systems you
directly compare I'll also just quickly
show PC mark 10 he a bit of a mess
because each system has a different GPU
and the test isn't a pure CPU workload
but once again you can't really see a
much separation between the nine 7:58
systems and other systems final few
charts for now really just summarized
the whole situation nicely here we have
the gigabyte or s 15 with its core i7
9750 h pitted against the average kuroh
78758 results we're seeing a tiny 2.8
percent performance gain on average and
that evaporates to a performance deficit
when compared to one of the fastest
chorus of an a 758 laptops that I've
tested and a soos Strix car to variant
the results are a little more favorable
for the MSI model eight percent faster
than the average cry 78758 laptop is a
strong result and there are particularly
good results in Cinebench single thread
and 7-zip compression but compared to a
fast chorus of an a7 58
and that margin is cut to just 4% which
probably isn't going to cut it for most
buyers something I haven't really talked
about is how the core i7 97 58 stacks up
against the quad core Core i7 70 782
because that will be a common upgrade
path for a lot of buyers as the 1970 58
is very similar to the 87 58 we're
looking at up to 50% gains are high in
some workloads with an average in this
selection of tasks of 42 percent for
gaming unfortunately I don't have a lot
to say on this topic yet because the two
laptops I received to review both had
our text 20 70 s in them which is a GPU
I never tested alongside the eye 78758
or really any other laptop CPUs without
a good apples to apples comparison
there's really no good data to show here
however my generalized impression so far
is that like with the productivity
workloads
there hasn't been any progress in gaming
performance when CPU limited CPU heavy
games like hitman two are really faster
than expected and the 97 58 doesn't have
noticeably higher clock behavior than
the 8750 18 games at best I anticipate
maybe a 5 percent improvement depending
on the models you are comparing but
there are a lot of variables at stake
here and having say only single channel
memory will make a much larger impact
than having the 87 58 over the 97 58 so
at this point I think a lot of you can
guess what the conclusion to this video
will be I can't say I'm surprised at
this outcome given the foundations for
the new core i7 9 750 H are identical to
the Cry 78758 but with Intel showing up
to 400 megahertz increases in base
clocks and boost clocks which admittedly
dropped to as low as a hundred megahertz
we're looking at the full clock table I
was expecting a little more and I think
a lot of buyers might be expecting more
than is actually being delivered the
reality is from the data I've collected
I can't honestly say the core i7 9750 H
is definitively faster than the cryo
78758 in real world
REM implementations it's looking like
the two CPUs are about equal in general
and at best the 9750 H is slightly
faster if you get a favorable matchup
between two laptops but it might also be
slower as evidenced by comparing my
gigabyte 9th gen test systems to some
last Genesis laptops this presents a bit
a tricky situation for laptop buyers to
figure out which of two given systems is
faster you'll have to dig into specific
model reviews and comparisons this is
similar to making a choice between
laptops within a generation rather than
what usually happens when comparing
across generations for example it was
clear that laptops with the core i7
8750 H were faster than those with the
previous query 770 700 HQ which made
that choice quite easy but here there's
no clear distinction with that in mind I
think it's fair to say that in general
there's not much difference between the
87 58 and 97 50 H so if an 87 50 H
system with otherwise equal specs is
cheaper than a new 97 58 system you'd
have to pick the last gen model and well
that's not great news for OMS that have
spent time specifically building new 97
58 laptops and I've often discounted
their last gen offerings it's really a
bit of a pointless product we would have
been fine continuing on with the same
performance from the trusty old
8750 h that's not to say it's
necessarily a bad product because if you
do find a 97 50 inch laptop at a good
price it shouldn't be notably slower
than a typical a 758 system and will
definitely provide a big performance
jump over 7th gen laptops or older but
it's not something you'd upgrade to from
an 8th gen core i7 and you really
shouldn't believe it's faster just based
on the spec sheet at least with the way
OMS implement these processes these days
so yeah that's the Intel Core i7 9750 H
I think the real interest in the 9th gen
line for laptops is with those new eight
core CPUs although we're unlikely to see
them in these sorts of form factors that
I looked at today with the MSI and
gigabyte models speaking of these
laptops quite like the MSI Morel it's
nothing super special or crazy but it
gets the job done and is decently
powerful really like the 240 Hertz
display on the Auris 15 but the cooler
noise ended up groaning my gears by the
end of the review process so not as much
of a fan of that particular one as
always you can subscribe for more laptop
content and other reviews consider
supporting us on patreon to get access
to some cool live streams and other
