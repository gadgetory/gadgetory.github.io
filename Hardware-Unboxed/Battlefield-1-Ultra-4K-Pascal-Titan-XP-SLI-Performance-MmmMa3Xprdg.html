boxes episode you would have seen the
almighty unveiling of the dual Paschal
Titan axes I have the pleasure being
able to mess around with at the moment I
don't normally do simple gameplay
footage videos but the timing of their
arrival plus the battlefield one better
seem too good to pass up so I put this
quick video together showing you a
little bit of gameplay and performance
there's only a couple of minutes so sit
back and enjoy this beautiful game
yeah
chief Charlie
one
you
No
we have armed objective
we have armed objective butter we have
armed objective actors
we have armed objective apples
we have armed objectives
so there you have it how good was that
battlefield one is an awesome looking
game and even more beautiful running at
90 to 100 FPS at 4k with everything set
to ultra the game ready driver
unfortunately removes support for SLI so
I had to roll back to the previous
version for it to work it seemed to
scale pretty well as one time next
seemed average around 60 FPS I hope you
guys enjoyed that if you want more

one better let me know in the comments
