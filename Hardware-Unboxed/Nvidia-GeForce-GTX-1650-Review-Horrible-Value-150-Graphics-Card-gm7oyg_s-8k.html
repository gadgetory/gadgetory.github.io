or really it was last night I haven't
slept since I don't know if you can see
how red my eyes I've had some eye drops
and that's helped anyway I haven't slept
since the last video that was uploaded
on the channel and that video informed
you guys about the situation with the
gtx 1650 basically spoke about how in
video we've held the press driver so
that no one could provide eight-day one
review when these things went on sale
very own choice by nvidia there and i
did speculate as to why they may have
done this based on the official specs
that seemed likely that in video is
trying to avoid any bad press or at
least reduce the volume of reviews
hitting that at the same time especially
when these things went on sale i also
speculated that gtx 1650 was going to be
around 10% slower on average and the
radiant RX 570 and this makes it a
rather pointless product dead-on-arrival
if you will anyway I grabbed the driver
as soon as it was available to the
public and I got testing due to time and
how long I can fight off needing to
sleep for just a dozen games have been
tested but I think this gives us a
really good picture of where the 1650
stands I'm not gonna go over specs or
any of that stuff again it's all in the
previous videos for those of you who are
interested for testing I'm using the msi
gtx 1650 gaming X which uses an external
6 pin PCI power connector but I also
have the gigabyte GTX 16 50 gaming OC on
hand in terms of FPS performance they
are identical I will compare the power
consumption operating temperatures of
these two models towards the end of the
review
finally for testing I'll be looking
closely performance at 1080p and exactly
a dozen titles and the system used
include a core Oh 999 arcade clocked at
5 bigots with 32 gigabytes of ddr4 3,200
memory ok let's get into the results
kick-starting the benchmarks we have a
brand new title World War Z and this
game supports the Vulcan API
though performance for NVIDIA GPUs isn't
great with the current driver so I've
tested the GeForce GPU using DirectX 11
and then the AMD GPUs using
the low-level Vulkan API doing Saussure
the radian rxt 570 absolutely smoked the
GTX 1650 by a whopping 38 percent margin
meanwhile the 1650 was just twenty six
percent faster than the 1050 Ti but also
fifteen percent slower than the three
year by 1060 performance at Apex legends
at least the quiet section of the game
that I test was very competitive between
the GTX 1615 rx 570 the radeon GPU was
still faster but this time by a 4%
margin and generally anything less than
5% we dima draw the division ii has been
a strong title for AMD and that
continues with the RX 570 in this gtx
1650 battle here the radio and GPU
offered 27% more performance it's a DP
making it the vastly superior GPU nvidia
promised good things in new complex
titles such as shut off the tomb raider
but here we see at the gtx 1650 simply
isn't delivering performance was similar
to that of the RX 570 but for a new GPU
similar performance really isn't good
enough the 1650s should be comfortably
beating the 570 at this price point the
1650 takes a serious beating and falls
on horizon for here it was 21 percent
slower than the RX 570 the performance
difference was also quite noticeable in
gamers the 570 never dipped below 60fps
allowing for a smoother gaming
experience on average the RX 570 was 11%
faster than the 1650 when testing with
Just Cause 4 typically this is a good
title for NVIDIA but even here the
budget Turing GPU just can't get it done
Resident Evil 2 as another new title it
works really well on AMD Harbor and here
the RX 570 was 30% faster than the GTX
1650 here we see that while the radeon
GPU was able to maintain over 60 FPS at
all times
the 1650 dropped down to 50 fps one game
that you can always depend on to boost
GeForce performance is fortnight and
here the GTX 1650 is able to just edged
out the rx 570 though overall I'd call
this one a tie the 1650 was also 26%
fast and the 1050 ti
MetroAccess is an Nvidia sponsored title
so you'd expect the GTX 16
to get the win here but it doesn't
basically it match the RX 570 but that
was the best it can do Rainbow six siege
throws us a curveball though given what
we've seen from the churring GPU so far
in this title we're pretty well ready
for it
here the gtx 1650 is able to beat the RX
570 and by a convincing margin as well
Shane we didn't see more of this here we
see similar frame rates in battlefield 5
here the RX 570 was slightly faster on
average while both provided a similar 1%
low result this meant the 1650 was 26%
fast in the gtx 750ti and 11% slower
than the 3 gigabyte 1060 the gtx 1650
doesn't really impress in farcry a new
dawn here it was just 23% fast and the
gtx 1050 TI which meant it was 18%
slower than the RX 570 in fact at 1080p
using the ultra quality preset it
struggled to average 60 FPS whereas the
570 maintained over 60 FPS at all times
moving on to power consumption here the
GTX 1650 is reasonably impressive the
gigabyte model pushes total system
consumption into 184 watts whereas the
MSI model hit 192 watts when compared to
the GTX 1050 Ti this is only around a 10
percent increase in total system draw
for what looked to be an over 30%
improvement in performance and we'll
look at that in a moment
meanwhile the RX 570 pushed total system
consumption 55% higher and while faster
overall it wasn't anywhere near 55
percent faster so the 1650 is certainly
the more efficient product but I'm still
not convinced it's better overall now
before we move on to the performance
summary here is a quick look at
operating temperatures and clock speeds
the MSI gaming X picked at 61 degrees in
a 21 degree room and this sort typically
operating at a boost frequency of 1920
megahertz so needless to say it was very
cool and quiet the larger gigabyte model
lo of the gaming OC that was able to
best to the result of the msi card
peaking at just 58 degrees and this
allowed it to average 1950 megahertz for
the boost clock in terms of frame rate
performance though this didn't really
have a significant impact as I said they
were basically identical one frame here
and there but still running
slightly cooler with a bump in frequency
is a win for gigabyte here okay so at
this point your socks should be firmly
in place the geforce gtx 1650 has been
pretty underwhelming so far but to get a
clearer picture of just how
underwhelming for 1650 is now let's look
at a few head-to-head comparisons for
some reason nvidia keeps comparing the
gtx 1650 to the gtx 1050 but the 1650 is
$10 more than the launch price of the
1050 TI so it's behind no means a
replacement for the $110 gtx 1050
when compared to the 1050 TI the 1650 is
just 35% faster on average and remember
the MSRP has been increased by 7% in any
case after three is a 35% boost at this
price point is very underwhelming then
when compared to the three gigabyte gtx
1060 the 1650 was found to be 9% slower
on average granted the 1060 came in at
$2 us but again it's now a three year
old product the 1650 only offered very
small performance gains and a few select
titles and best case it wasn't even 5%
faster than the outgoing Pascal GPU now
when compared to the GTX 1660 the 1650
was 32% slower which seems pretty good
given its 32% cheaper that works out
rather well at least in a GTX chirring
bubble it does but as you're about to
see in this price range there's quite a
bit of competition and serious
competition at that here we have the
Radeon rx 570 which is a $170 us part or
at least it was once upon a time for
many many months now it's been selling
for as little as a hundred and thirty
dollars u.s. and currently there are
multiple options available at that price
this makes the gtx 1650 around 15% more
expensive and yet we found it to be 10%
slower on average and after 20% slower
in multiple titles so then the gtx 1650
is indeed dead on arrival and if you
need further proof of that then here we
have the cost per frame graph two years
after the release of the RX 570 we're
getting a GPU that's 31% more costly per
frame
that's really bad and
even if we ignore the insanely good rx
570s the rx 580 is still better value
offering way more performance for a
small price premium again we can see
that the 1650 offers a similar level of
value to that of the 1660 but at under
$200 where Nvidia faces much different
competition it just doesn't cut it well
that went pretty much as expected based
on the specs that we discussed in
yesterday's video or last night's video
whatever the hell that video happened I
felt like the 1650 was going to be our
around 10% slower than the rx 570 a 10%
slower on average and as luck would have
it that was the exact margin that we
found at least based on our testing from
the 12 game sample at the current $150
u.s. MSRP the GTX 1650 is a pointless
product and it can't compete with two to
three-year-old GPUs from the competition
at 110 dollars us the 1650 would have
been competitive and not particularly
exciting but at least competitive for it
to be a really compelling option Nvidia
would need to charge $100 us so we need
a 33% price cut to really recommend this
thing I know some will argue that the
GTX 1650 is great because it doesn't
need an external power connector but in
my opinion you're kind of clutching at
straws on that one you can upgrade your
power supply if need be for around $35
us to a decent 450 to 500 watt model and
that'll certainly get you out of trouble
then for those that can upgrade their
power supply in order to upgrade their
GPU well I think it's fair to say that
is a super niche category of gamer
moreover I've noticed that the GTX 1650s
that lack an external PCIe power input
so models that don't have this little
guy here but both the models I have do
we have noticed the models that don't
have that connector they're clocked much
lower because well they're limited to 75
watts they draw all their power from the
PCI Express connector piso express x 16
connector there so yeah these ones
aren't limited to that so they can clock
a bit higher so it's gonna be very
interesting to see how much slower the
cards without the connector are and I
suspect the upgrade over the GTX 1650 ti
will be
yeah well less impressive obviously will
be less impressive but I think it'll be
less impressive to the degree where yeah
this well I suppose it just makes this
even more pointless doesn't it anyway
that's some extra testing that I'll have
to do
I've taken some of our patreon money and
I've ordered a few base model 1650s so
yeah I'll follow up shortly with that
content after I can asleep and yeah
we'll see how they go but I yeah I don't
expect that too
well I don't expect it to put the the
1650s in a better position because yeah
as I said the 75-watt limited models
will be noticeably slower and anyway I
think just ending this this video this
this miserable release for me yeah this
product's pointless I think it's fair to
say it was dead on arrival yeah you can
pretty much ignore it that's that's a
really big shame because I really liked
the RT X 2060 I liked the GTX 1660 Ti
and I liked the vanilla 1660 they all
really appealed to me and yeah so it's a
bit of a shame to see that good run of
nice value reasonably exciting products
come to a serious and a sharp halt with
the 1650 and it appears like the RX 570
will live on so we never never die
graphics card that one anyway if you did
enjoy this video sorry if it was a bit
all over the place a bit slow-paced I
was a bit off my game but if you did
like it please hit the like button and
if you appreciate me staying up for a
very long time to get all the testing
done and wait for Nvidia to release the
drivers and all that nonsense then yeah
I suppose you can leave a like you can
subscribe for more content where I'm
much more awake you can support us on
patreon so that allows us to buy
graphics cards such as the ones without
the the six pin connector because I
imagine the companies we work with won't
be too keen to send us any more of these
cards and they usually aren't too keen
to send base models anyway haven't be
able to get my hands on any of the base
models 1660 1662 eyes or our text 26 TS
but we'll be buying those and yeah it's
awesome patreon members that allow us to
do that we do have a really cool patreon
community as well and I keep you guys in
the loop of what's going on behind the
scenes all that sort of stuff over on
our discord chat anyway thank you for
watching
I'm Yuri Steve and I'll see you again
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
