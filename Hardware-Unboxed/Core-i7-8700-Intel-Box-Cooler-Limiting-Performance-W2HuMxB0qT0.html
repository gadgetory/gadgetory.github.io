we're gonna try and clear up the coffee
like boost clock conspiracy and we're
gonna do this before showing you the 300
series motherboards which you'll see
very shortly but before then I have some
extra information on this subject that
I'd like to share with you before we get
to the data though I would like to just
quickly give you a bit of a backstory so
in a nutshell the claim was that intel's
six core coffee-like cpus couldn't hold
the same clock speeds reviewers were
seeing on high-end zed 370 motherboards
as they would on the yet to be released
budget 360 motherboards
although the locked core i5 8400 and
core i7 8700 have a 65 watt TDP rating
the worry was that they couldn't sustain
an all core Bruce frequency of 3.8
gigahertz and 4.3 gigahertz respectively
at these frequencies the six core CPUs
would simply be too power hungry for a
budget vrm to deliver enough power
causing the CPU to throttle down and run
at a lower frequency at which point it
could become dramatically slower than
what the reviews show cooling was also a
concern since most reviewers use
expensive aftermarket cooling and not
intel's pathetic little 73 what box
cooler though I'm not sure this is
entirely true for reviews that covered
the locked parts we've only reviewed the
core i5 8400 here at harbor unboxed and
we did so using the Box cooler in
addition to some aftermarket cooling
anyway in a previous video we bought a
few of the worst said 370 boards we
could find and test them with the 8700 K
using the Box cool that comes with these
65 watt locked parts and then compared
them to a cheap air cooler as well as a
high-end all-in-one liquid cooler the
8700 K is of course a 95 watt part so
the cooler was obviously underpowered
however because the Zed 370 boards I
used were happy to let the 8700 case
sizzle away at the maximum temperature
the cores can reach before thermal
throttling kicks in otherwise known as
the TJ Maxx the performance drop wasn't
that bad I also tested the six core six
thread core i5 8400 and found that with
the box cooler on budget said 370 boards
it really had no trouble holding the 3.8
gigahertz all Corbeau
frequency after an hour-long stress test
so whether you're using the box cooler
or a high-end custom liquid cooled
solution on the core i5 8400 performance
will be much the same the 8700 K
obviously benefits from better cooling
as it is a 95 watt part that's designed
to be overclocked but even so a
ten-dollar air cooler will have you
covered at least at the stock
frequencies anyway I was keen to
purchase a core i7 8700 for further
testing but I felt like it was probably
best to wait for the budget be 360
motherboards to rock up and then retest
however not that long ago as rocks sent
over their new desk mini featuring a
tiny STX ed 370 motherboard and for
testing they also said along the core i7
8700 as luck would have it I thought
what a perfect opportunity to do some
additional testing and well the results
are very interesting just as I was
beginning my testing a longtime
subscriber notified me that in my
previous video I helped spread some
misinformation about Intel's turbo core
ratios as most of you are probably aware
until made the marketing decision with
their coffee like CPUs to only advertise
the base and single called turbo clock
speeds and this is what caused the
conspiracy that these CPUs couldn't hold
the all called turbo frequencies that
the reviewers were seeing I myself
actually made the mistake of repeating
some of this information about the boost
clocks without looking into it properly
and as it turns out the claims aren't
entirely true the two three four five
and six core turbo frequencies are still
publicly available and can be read from
the CPUs default turbo boost multiplier
table but because the Intel isn't
advertising them you have to do a little
bit of digging here until it's actually
done this in the past though with their
Sandy Bridge processors for example one
way you can quickly and easily read the
default turbo boost multiplier table is
by downloading and installing the Intel
X to you software in the right sidebar
you can see a heap of useful information
about your CPU and how its configured by
the motherboard and you can also see the
multiplier table and here the turbo
boost values are marked as active cause
in the case of the core i7 8700 with all
six cores active Intel is indeed
targeting a 43 times multiplier for a
4.3 year it's
operating frequency additionally you can
also see that 4.3 gigahertz is targeted
with 4 and 5 cause active then with 3
cause I look up to 4.4 gigahertz and
then 4.5 gigahertz with 2 cause okay so
now we have that sorted out it was time
to see how the core i7 8700 got on with
the asrock desk mini and it's teeny tiny
verum featuring some of the smallest
passive cooling you're likely to ever
see on a motherboard under the laughably
small heat sinks is a 5 plus 1 phase VM
though it proved surprisingly capable
despite Azra limiting CPU support to 65
watt models if you recall in a previous
video I discussed the computer base
review of the media on a razor a
prebuilt featuring the core i7 8700
performed around 10 to 15 percent slower
than what was seen by most reviews take
the cinema
r15 multi-threaded score for example the
8700 managed just twelve hundred and
three points in the media on PC where
his computer bases own test system
allowed for a score of 1389 points
that's a 15 percent improvement in score
at the time I put this down to the ECS
motherboard that was used by that
particular pre-built rather than issue
with the Intel spec for the 8700 with
those results in the back of my mind I
moved on a test the asrock - mini and
honestly I was expecting to find a much
better result but what I got was a much
worse result out of the box the Desmond
he was scoring just eleven hundred and
twenty seven points and that's a further
six percent reduction from medium PC so
I started to dig into why this was I
quickly realized that the desk mini was
configured for a maximum package TDP of
65 watts now you might think well that
makes sense the core i7 8,700 is a 65
watt part after all however the TDP is
calculated from the base clock not the
boost clocks the 8700 has a base clock
frequency of just 3.2 gigahertz and here
we can see while keeping within the 65
watt envelope it can sustain an
operating frequency of 3.5 gigahertz 3.5
gigahertz though is a nineteen percent
drop from 3.4 gigahertz and this is why
we're seeing exactly a 19 percent drop
in score from computer bases 1389 points
from their test system to just eleven
hundred and twenty seven points in the
desk
so does this mean the 8700 is simply to
power-hungry and will require a higher
ends at 370 motherboy to achieve maximum
performance well turns out the answers
actually no and I'll explain why using
the XTU software I decided to see what
the asrock testimony could do with the
limits removed and what kind of risk
this would expose it to bumping the
package TDP up to 85 watts had minimal
impact on performance so did 95 watts
105 watts and even 135 watts even
increasing the current really didn't
make that much difference to the score
however there was a tail here using the
stock 65 watt configuration the XTU
software detected power limit throttling
not surprising as the 8700 currently
reached 3.5 gigahertz under these
conditions and that's clearly because
the motherboards power limiting it
increasing the package TDP to just 75
watts still saw power limit throttling
but interestingly it also introduced a
thermal throttling as well and we are of
course still using the Intel Box cooler
then with the 85 watt configuration
where mostly thermal throttling and by
the time we hit 95 Watts were thermal
throttling exclusively and this is with
the case panel removed so the Box cooler
has direct access to cool air outside of
the case in a 21 degree room the desk
Mini is configured to allow for a
maximum CPU package temperature of 82
degrees
so the second the Box cool hits that
which pretty much takes one second under
load the clock speed starts to rapidly
decline at this point I started to
wonder what the core i5 8400 would do
using the 95 watt configuration so I
threw it into the desk Mini with the Box
cooler and ran some tests the 8400 was
able to maintain 3.8 gigahertz on all
calls after an hour long stress test and
delivered the exact same Cinebench r15
multi throat score as it does in our
liquid cooled coffee like test rig the
reason for this was that the Intel Box
cooler kept the 8400 below the 82 degree
threshold it maxed out at just 77
degrees the next step then was to take
the 8400 out of the desk mini and then
reinstall the 8700 but do so with a
cheap tower style air cooler to see if
the limit really was the entire box
cooler with the ultra cheap deep cooled
gamax 200 T strapped on our
cinnamon jar 15 with the TDP set to 130
watts and the current set to 138 amps to
my surprise the 8700 instantly sped out
a score of thirteen hundred and
sixty-one points which is within the
margin of error when compared to what we
see on a high-end test system using a
liquid cooler to confirm all of this I
installed the Intel Core i7 8700 with
the Intel Box cooler on a high and ZEB
370 desktop motherboard and with the
same limits in the XTU software we get
the same results and with the limits
basically removed but with an 82 degree
thermal limit in place we were limited
to around 1200 points again this is with
the Intel Box cooler so the limiting
factor here is the Intel Box cooler and
asrock has deliberately turned down the
package TDP and set an 82 degree thermal
limit to avoid winding the thing up to
deafening levels not to save their vrm
in fact with the game ax 210 installed
the 8700 K cranking out big numbers the
desk minis vrm never went above 50
degrees even after an extensive stress
test with a packaged TDP of 65 watts the
fan on the Intel Box cooler spun at 2100
rpm and here it was clearly audible but
not outrageous however increasing the
package TDP to just 75 what saw the fan
spin right up to 3100 rpm and here it
was a screeching Banshee sorry the
entire Intel con Lake conspiracy can be
blamed on the Intel Box cooler which is
funny because in my last video I said
this if Intel should be accused of
anything it's that their lock CPUs come
with complete not a garbage to cool them
their box coolers have almost always
been a joke and the cool that comes with
their 65 watt TDP models is a complete
joke at least when paired with their
expensive six core models that being
said I should note there really isn't a
conspiracy here it's certainly no con
job yes the Box cooler sucks there's no
arguments from me about that however
even with the Box cooler the 8700 does
exactly what it's advertised to do it
exceeds the 3.2 gearheads base frequency
at all times for non AVX workloads and
4.6 gigahertz on a single core is also
achieved what it can't do is reach the
4.3 gigahertz old core boost frequency
using the Box cooler at least under
reasonable operating conditions if you
let the 8700 hit 100 degrees Celsius
with the Box cooler it will deliver
optimal performance it just does so at a
sub optimal temperature I can kind of
already imagine the comments on this one
but Steve that's the con job Intel's not
advertising the old core frequency
because the 8700 can't do it with the
Box cooler well yeah I kind of get that
but unless they're specifically telling
reviewers by the 8700 and then test it
with anything but lebackes cooler it's
kind of not a con job
as you've seen intel states the six five
four three and two core ratios and their
XTU software they just don't advertise
them however even if they did this
really doesn't change anything
Intel just like AMD only states that
these frequencies can be achieved when
the processor is conforming to its
temperature voltage power delivery and
current control limits so in short Intel
doesn't guarantee boost clock speeds
barely guarantee that worst case the CPU
will run at its base clock frequency
even the single core boost clock which
is advertised isn't guaranteed as all
the parameters that we just mentioned
have to be in check I never reviewed the
core i7 8700 because I couldn't actually
get one when the series was first
released had I got one though and only
tested it with an aftermarket cooler
then that would have been well pretty
much on me and my review would have been
misleading to properly review the 8700
you really need to do so with the Box
cooler and then maybe also show some
aftermarket cooling performance as well
because a lot of people are willing to
spend ten dollars to improve cooling
performance and well performance in
short there all this drama over the TDP
ratings and motherboard power delivery
has probably been for nothing the real
issue here is the underwhelming Intel
Box cooler at least on the 8700 and
nothing's going to change that for the
upcoming be 360 motherboards as a side
note I should also mention that this was
a best-case scenario for the Intel Box
cooler as it was fed plenty of cool air
in a room with an ambient air
temperature of just 21 degrees so it's
likely that you probably see worse
results with the 8700 in a warmer
environment that's what I strongly
believe budget parts like the core i3
8100 and Core i5 84
for example our going to deliver the
exact same performance with the Box
cooler on B 360 boards as they do on the
expensive Zed 370 motherboards and I'm
99.9% certain that this will also be
true for the 8700 at least within reason
I mean there will be some 50 to 60
dollar boards that might not be up to
the task especially those without any
kind of vrm cooling at all of course
this is true for any motherboard or
certainly any motherboard on a
mainstream platform for example the
ultra cheap asrock a B 350 M HD v and
this is an a m4 motherboard it doesn't
support rise and 7 1800 X 1700 X or even
the 1600 X processor as the vrm features
no form of cooling and can't handle
those parts anyway you can rest assured
that will have all the answers for you
when it comes to the Intel budget B 360
motherboards in another video very soon
and that's going to do it for this one
