video is something that I've been
wanting to cover for a little while now
but unfortunately haven't really been
able to get around to it sooner you can
blame the holiday period and CES for
that one anyway last year intel unveiled
a new series of you series laptop
processors designed for ultra portables
and I use the term new quite loosely
here these CPUs are codenamed whiskey
Lake and there's still eight generation
parts in fact they're not radically
different from KB like refresh that came
before it the main change is the move
from Intel's 14 nanometer plus to their
14 nanometer plus plus process node
which has allowed slightly higher clock
speeds within the same power envelope
the basic design of these CPUs is
unchanged from the previous generation
which is probably why they're still
being called 8th gen parts rather than
ninth gen to fit in with intel's current
desktop lineup there are also only three
SKUs the core i7 85/60 5u and core i5 80
265 you are both for core 8 threads CPUs
while the core i3 81 45 U is a dual core
part with four threads all are 15 watt
parts although the TDP can be configured
anywhere from 10 watts to 25 Watts
depending on what the OEM wants the
focus of this video is the core i7 85 65
u which is essentially the new flagship
15 watt CPU in Intel's lineup this is a
little confusing as previously there was
a core i7
8650 you but the 85 65 u is actually
clocked higher at a single core turbo
clock of 4.6 gigahertz up from 4.2
gigahertz and all core turbo of 4.1
gigahertz up from 3.9 gigahertz the base
clock is a little lower though at 1.8
gigahertz compared to 1.9 gigahertz and
these clock speed increases are even
more favorable when comparing the ice of
an 85 65 view to the eye 78550 U which
is more life for like in a comparison
going on the naming scheme comparing
those two CPUs gives at least an 11%
boost clock advantage to whisky Lake it
seems that a lot of OMS weren't super
excited by whisky Lake unlike cable a
refresh that came before
because we didn't see a lot of laptop
refreshes in 2018 that decided to use
these new parts it's only now in 2019 at
CES that more vendors are jumping on
board and I suspect that it's due to
relatively modest clock speed increases
making it not as much of an urgent or
necessary upgrade so in preparation for
these 2019 releases I'm going to be
detailing how whiskey lake specifically
the core i7 85/60 5u performs in
comparison to a range of other laptop
class processes this should give you a
good idea of how the CPU stacks up would
be a perfect reflection because laptop
vendors can change you know a number of
different aspects including the cooler
memory configuration and tvp's which all
impact performance boy I'll be showing
today should be I guess very close to
what you'll see in most laptop
implementations crucially I've tested
the core i7 85 65 you using the new
Razer Blade stealth which is an
excellent test platform for a number of
reasons firstly this laptop uses the 25
watt maximum TDP configuration for the
CPU so we'll see how this chip performs
in devices that choose this
configuration and have larger coolers
Dell for example tends to use 25 watts
for their XPS line then using intel's
extreme tuning utility i've also been
able to set the cpu down to its regular
15 watt configuration this is the most
common configuration and reflects the
majority of laptops that will use this
CPU having both sets of data should give
a pretty comprehensive look at how this
processor performs the blade self is
also a good platform because it includes
16 gigabytes of dual channel memory
again that's a common configuration and
dual channel is key because the best
performing laptops have dual channel
memory on top of this the laptop also
has discreet nvidia geforce MX 150
graphics over this benchmark video the
MX 150 has been disabled for all testing
a razorblade star review will be up in a
few days and that will cover the actual
performance of this laptop with its
discrete GPU enables a few other things
about whiskey like to mention before we
get into the benchmarks and those
beautiful blue charts you will love
firstly the GPU and cache configuration
are unchanged compared to cable ache
refresh so while still looking at a UHD
620 GPU at up to eleven fifty megahertz
in the core i7 eighty 565 you own with 8
megabytes of level for a cache
typical pl2 power limits also appear to
be unchanged so we're still looking at
short bursts up to 44 watts with the 15
watt configuration and 51 watts with the
25 watt configuration although of course
laptop OMS can and do change these
metrics quite a lot depending on the
models that they're producing alright
let's take a look at performance
starting with Cinebench r15 a favorite
of everyone reviewing a cpu for the past
how many years now and the
multi-threaded test is a relatively
short benchmark but it has a decent mix
of both boost and steady-state clock
speed behavior despite higher boost
clocks the 80 565 you in its 15 what
configuration ends up only 3% faster
than the 85 50 you in the multi-threaded
test the 25 watt configuration okay it's
a healthy 11 percent boost which is in
line with the boost clock difference
both configs are a fair bit faster in
the single threaded test here though to
explain what's going on it's worth
looking at a clock speed comparison
during a Cinebench run both the 15 watt
and 25 watt configurations start off at
their maximum all core turbo clock speed
which is 3.7 gigahertz for the 8550 you
and 4.1 gigahertz to the 85 65 you
however when the CPU reverts to its pl/1
state so it's no longer boosting anymore
there's quite a difference in behavior
the 25 watt 8550 you is sitting around
the 2.6 to 2.7 gigahertz mark however
the 25 watt 85 65 you is up at 3.1
gigahertz so that's a quite healthy gain
for the 85 65 you and contributes to the
larger gain in performance when looking
at the 15 watt CPUs the 85 50 you sits
at 2.2 to 2.3 gigahertz compared to 2.3
to 2.4 gigahertz for the a5 65 you there
is a gain for the 85 65 you but it's not
as large as you get at 25 watts what's
apparent here is that the advantage is
that 40 nanometers plus plus brings to
whiskey Lake aren't all that accessible
with a tiny 15 watt power limit sure you
do get a decent jump in boost clock
speeds but when the CPU averts to its
long-term pale 1 power state there's not
a lot to be gained from the 85 65 you
however at 25 Watts the taps are opened
a bit more on whiskey Lake can stretch
its legs to provide a decent jump in
performance looking at the Cinebench r15
performance
again it's also quite impressive to see
where the 25-watt configuration is
sitting among the pack the 25 watt 85 65
u is almost as fast as the core i7 7700
HQ in the multi-threaded test and it
smokes it in the single thread test the
7700 HQ is a 45 watt quad core designed
for gaming laptops so it's great to see
that performance now available in ultra
portable form factors we see a similar
situation in x264 encoding the 25 watt
85 65 u is right up there with the 7700
HQ while the 15 watt configuration is
providing up to an 8 percent gain over
the 85 50 you handbrake x265 was a
really interesting benchmark to run as
it shows an even harsher reality for the
15 what configuration of these CPUs with
this TDP limit there was no difference
in performance between 85 50 you and 85
65 you likely due to the use of AVX
instructions the further limit what
low-power CPS can chief however with the
25 watt configurations the 85 65 you is
a good 17 percent faster which is
slightly above the difference in long
term clock speeds we also see that while
the 85 65 you was close to the 7700 HQ
in previous tests when a V X is required
the 7700 HQ and other 45 watt CPUs begin
to pull away Adobe premier benefits
strongly from GPU acceleration and I GPU
in these 15 watt CPUs is pretty weak you
can see that the top 3 CPUs that are
paired with discrete class graphics
smoke the competition here we also see
the 15 watt 85 65 you fall slightly
behind the 85 50 you a strange result
and the only benchmark where this was
the case that said the 25 watt
configuration is now for 10% faster
Microsoft Excel is a workload that runs
entirely within the PL to boost States
so there is no difference in performance
between the 25 watt and 15 watt
configurations the i7 85 65 you holds a
small advantage over the 85 50 you and
both sit around the same mark as the
7700 HQ another impressive showing
MATLAB is another good result for the 85
65 you with an 8% game present with the
15 watt configuration over the 85 50 you
while the 25 watt config jumps up to a
14% gain
again in this short burst single core
workload there's not a lot of difference
between most of intel's recent cpus and
considering it also thrives on memory
bandwidth where there has been virtually
no improvement we're left with a big
clumping at the top of the chart 7-zip
is another benchmark where we see small
general gen improvements with whiskey
lake mostly because again this test is
short and runs in the boost clock zone
not a lot more to say here so let's move
on Adobe Photoshop shows some of the
largest gains between generations with
the 15 watt skew delivering 13% more
performance and the 25 watt skews
showing gains of 26% much higher than
the average a very strong showing for
whiskey Lake here it's also worth
looking at PCU mark 10 here where again
we see decent generational gains between
age cpu the 15 watt SKU provides 12%
more performance which is in line with
some of the single threaded short burst
workloads we've seen and that's largely
what PC mark tests I want to briefly
touch on GPU performance as well though
there's not a lot to say here
considering there hasn't been any change
to the GPU and whiskey lake compared to
K be like refresh big gains are expected
for the next generation but we're not
getting anything here looking across our
3d mark workloads like sky diver most of
the games you're seeing are from higher
CPU scores when looking at purely GPU
scores there is next to no improvement
also in more GPU intensive workloads
whiskey leg still gets handily beaten by
AMD's rise in mobile processes it's now
time to look through some overall
summaries of how the cryo 780 565 view
performs on average the 15-watt
configuration of the 85 65 u is 8
percent faster than the 85 50 years
though these games largely appear in
either single threaded workloads short
workloads or some combination of the two
in longer workloads like video encoding
you can expect less than a 5 percent
performance improvement when comparing
the 25 watt configurations the gains are
more significant here up to a 15 percent
improvement on average with quite a
healthy gain in longer workloads this is
more in line with the clock speed
differences between the two processes
data 565 u is simply clocked higher so
you can expect it to perform better
especially with a higher power limit the
25 watt core i7 85 65 u is also now
delivering performance in line with the
45
what core i7 7700 HQ in some workloads
dat 565 you is less than 1% behind on
average this means that in the space of
roughly two years Intel has been able to
take gaming laptop level CPU performance
and put that into ultra portable types a
C's sure you need to use the upper end
25 watt configuration to achieve this
but it's impressive considering all the
hate Intel does get for its 14 nanometer
plus plus process Tech and then when
comparing the 15 watt 85 65 you to even
just the core i7 7500 year from a few
years ago it's pretty much an on contest
with double the core and thread count
the 85 65 u is on average 35% faster and
that margin only increases when looking
strictly at multi-core workloads if
you're coming from a dual-core ultra
portable to a quad-core whiskey like
system expect to see significant
performance improvements across all
workloads either from the doubling of
cores or from the large clock speed
gains so overall I think there's a
couple of ways to look at what whiskey
lake is bringing to the table on the one
hand there's not a lot to be gained in
its 15 watt configuration we're looking
at single-digit improvements for the
most part and sometimes for longer
workloads no improvements compared to K
be like refresh Intel's 40 nanometer
node is clearly limiting them from
achieving larger gains the shift of 40
nanometer + + I guess can only do so
much the best you'll get from whiskey
lake is in the 25 watt configuration
where performance improvements tend to
match the clock speed gains more closely
at around a 15 percent improvement
however it's rare to find a 25 watt
system the 15 watt config is much more
common so for the majority of buyers
looking at a whiskey lake system there's
not a lot of incentive to upgrade from
KB like refresh or to buy a whiskey lake
system if it costs more than a last gen
KB like machine however on the other
hand it's hard not to be impressed with
what Intel has achieved over the last
few years without significant advances
to process technology short on the
desktop 40 nanometer + + + + + I guess
is now a bit of a joke and performance
gains in your outside of increased core
counts are anywhere from unimpressive to
non-existent but on the mobile side
within the same sort of ultra portable
laptop designs we've gone from - cause
Motors clock speeds to fall cause at
reasonably high clock speeds are largely
the same process note in architecture
performance that used to be restricted
to gaming laptops is now accessible in
more portable form factors which is
certainly very impressive and while a
whiskey lake isn't a huge step over KB
like refresh it will be a massive
improvement to anyone upgrading from a
dual-core seventh gen system or earlier
typical laptop upgrade cycles are quite
long if you're using a four-year old
laptop for example you can expect huge
improvements upgrading to something 8th
gen that said I'd still shop around
because you don't necessarily need
whiskey Lake to access those gains KB
like R is also fine there is still one
lingering issue with intel's mobile
processors and that's the GPU side with
basically zero improvements in this
department for generations now Intel a
lagging way behind what is required for
a modern ultra portable AMD has realised
this as their beefy Vega GPU in their
riser mobile ap use handily crush Intel
integrated graphics lots of OEMs have
also realized and are starting to pay
invidious MX 150 discrete GPU with
Intel's 15 watt CPUs to get that extra
GPU performance it does seem like
whiskey Lake is a bit of a stopgap until
Intel can get their 10 nanometer CPUs
out of the door at the end of 2019 which
will bring a much larger and more
competitive gen 11 integrated GPU with
only 5 to 15 percent performance gains
on the CPU side as well it's really all
Intel could do at this point and OEMs
weren't exactly rushing out risky like
systems and I think that is a reflection
of this overall situation at Intel
spying themselves in anyway that's it
for this look at whiskey lake
performance with the crisis of an 85 65
you story to those who are waiting for
