the second part of our June Q&amp;amp;A coming
right up plenty of other questions to
answer so let's get straight into it
okay next question
do the harbor box team have all other
computers that we use for our day-to-day
use as good as the ones we sort of
feature on the channel so with custom
water cooler and all that fancy stuff
well yes I would say yeah basically I
did a what was it the thermaltake core P
throughout your custom loop in that and
that was my core i7 6.50 X system which
I replaced last year with three reppin
1950 X and I didn't actually build that
on the channel because lazy but timid I
both wanna upgrade to the 32 core thread
Ripper so we're going to be handing AMD
for a pair of those chips try and get
the creation board from MSI and we might
do like a live stream where we both
build dream editing rigs that'd be cool
yeah so our systems are sort of rundown
dusty old things that are left in the
corner and no keep it updated so yeah
bit of fun so there you just built
second generalising yeah I've got a few
test systems for second germs still
using first gen on my main memory but
it's you know pretty similar we're
getting on like you know like either
Titan X in my system at Pascal Titan X
so again it's you know yeah like she's a
lot of high-end hardware for our editing
and that sort of thing so basically it's
not all just sitting on the shelves
behind it collecting dust some of it
does get put to good use
yep in your opinion do you think that
buying a g-sync monitor justifies the
price increase and that is very much a
Tim question yeah I think it depends
what you're sort of comparing g-sync to
if you've got like a g-sync monitor and
a pretty similar identical freesync
monitor you don't care about adaptive
sync the free sync motor is just clearly
better value because it's like $200
cheaper usually but if you do want
adaptive sync you're kind of stuck
because if you have an NVIDIA GPU you
need to buy g-sync mana you know if
you're on AMD you need to buy free sync
so from that sense is kind of like you
have no real option hmm um but some
g-sync might as well through
exclusive so I guess there's some maybe
some reason to buy that if you've got MD
but I think you know if you're wondering
about whether you should buy an adaptive
sing come on at all for example you've
got an Nvidia cheaper you're thinking of
buying a g-sync monitor or whether you
just will be fine with free sync really
if you're playing it like 80 or 100 FPS
or higher you're not gonna get all that
much out of adaptive sync so ice a free
sync 1080p 144 Hertz monitor on an
Nvidia system will be almost just as
good as a g-sync monitor provided you're
running at those sort of high frame
range so it just depends what you're
after and you know if you're on a budget
I still think free sync does offer
something for people that have NVIDIA
GPUs first thing certainly makes a lot
more sense yeah this question parent is
for me do you think a hot-swappable PCIe
will come to laptops to solve the
funderbolt three issue for a GPU so
maybe you guys saw my video a couple of
days ago and why I don't think a GPS are
all that good mostly because of
thunderbolt three I'm not sure they'll
come up with like a dedicated PCIe port
because that won't be super useful for
other things Thunderbolt 3 doubles up as
your SBC so it's kind of useful for
attaching displays and other USB drives
and all that sort of thing I just think
a next-gen thunderbolt will hopefully
solve some of those problems so that's
really where it stands fingers crossed
for that right this question comes from
YouTube do you see yourselves Steve and
Tim doing YouTube / tech journalism
until you retire or would you want to
move on to something new if so what
would it be
okay so first pile that question well
yeah I've actually thought about this a
few times and I don't know but I think I
could probably see myself doing this
right up well into my senior years via
senior citizen playing with new tech I
don't know it's kind of a weird one
because it's definitely something you
could do yeah it's not like you know
it's not like you know something that's
labor intensive so yeah I'd like to keep
doing it as long as we can as long as
I'm still having fun with it which I
very much am at the moment same here
really yep if I wasn't doing it
something I would like to do something
that I couldn't do as a senior citizen
and that would be sort of hands-on stuff
like I really like renovating and doing
that kind of thing so I'd probably go
into like property sort of investment
renovating houses all that kind of stuff
so yeah I enjoy building and doing all
that yeah I probably become an engineer
a master's degree in engineering so if I
didn't do this I probably use that
degree so yeah okay next question what
was the first GPU you ever purchased
well the first graphics card for me much
older than my one I'm guessing no you to
worry about when they didn't ask when
for me it was a creative labs so I don't
know you guys are probably still
familiar with creative they do a lot of
audio products Bluetooth speaker sound
cards but they used to do graphics cards
and I had a voodoo banshee 16 megabyte
AGP and yeah I used to benchmark it with
3d mark 99 a few guys recall but 3d mark
joke from my GTX 20/80 joke video I mean
anyway I loved that thing it was really
cool I don't actually recall right off
top of my head what games I played on it
but I do remember when benchmarking at
3d mark 9 you know my best friend at the
time he had the exact same computer we
built them together but he could only
get the PCI version of the Banshee and
it was one point lower in 3d man I
always mean by one point because I had
an AGP model so I don't know if it was
actually one point faster or for some
reason it just assigned an extra point
because you had the AGP version I don't
know maybe someone knows something about
that ancient software yeah always one
point faster exactly one point no matter
what the school is worth oh yeah I'd to
look up and verso remember the first one
that I that I bought fine
fairly confident was an ATI Radeon X
1900 so that's from 2005 I reviewed that
and and that was to upgrade really like
a fruit my family to pre-built PC and I
wanted to play Star Wars Battlefront 2
the original one okay it's really
annoying that there's two games called
stars Battlefront 2 but whatever I
really want to play that game a PC
couldn't play it so when I got the
Radeon X 1900 tracked it in and away I
went playing that games really sort of
the first PC gaming sort of thing I did
and then a computer nerd was born yeah
pretty much
okay next question this is one tim peake
so hopefully you can explain this one to
me how do you think we will ever use
a different contact method for CPUs like
more surface area or different hand
shapes etc so I don't think this is the
mounting method for the CPU it's like
are we talking you'd like the IHS sort
of thought likes it the IHS or what we
put on the I yeah I suppose it's the
yeah it has a contact between your
cooler and the CPU itself hmm okay well
okay that being the case just quickly
think you this not really I suppose
because there it really comes down to
the die size on the CPU and that's sort
of the problem with CPUs getting smaller
and smaller is that you have a really
small point that's pumping out tons of
heat and you've got to try and dissipate
that as quickly as possible so the heat
spread up so that quite a few different
purposes really does it it primarily
probably protects the CPU really but it
obviously spreads the heat as the name
heat spreader suggests but yeah I
haven't thought about this one too much
but I don't yeah so it seems fine as it
is yeah well they've kind of
purpose-built anyway so in the case of
thread Ripper they're massive because
they have to be because there's four
dice spread out where is in the case of
what coffee like they're really small
because there's one little die in the
middle okay here we go another longer
question I'm just curious it seemed two
years ago the i-5 60 600 K was the most
what most tech troopers would suggest is
the premiered gaming CPU so why isn't
the 83 50 K or the 80 600 K getting the
same treatment has caught and third
utilization changed enough to warrant
this always a bad advice then and bad
advice and hell it's none of those
things really it wasn't bad advice then
because there was no alternative I mean
I suppose you could have bought a core
i7 but in terms of value just getting
hyper threading tacked on didn't really
warrant that additional cost and the
only 350 K is poor value in my opinion
because of the reasons I covered in my
top five worst CPUs video basically it's
the price it's just not a good CP of the
price because we now have better CPUs
for a similar price so that's the main
reason there and then as for the Core i5
8600 K I did recently name that
the best value high-end gaming CPU so
it's pretty good yeah I I was under the
impression that most people were
recommending the ATT Turner okay it's
got six cores that clock five gigahertz
it's a weapon really yeah I don't have a
problem with that CPU it's really good
yeah games are starting use more threads
now I think the biggest reason why we're
no longer raving about quad cores is
because we have faster CPUs with six
cores on it necessarily faster we have
CPUs that are as fast but have more
cores and they're affordable so they're
not a thousand dollars anymore so that's
the main reason
Rison has been a big push towards that
so yep okay next question
opinion on starting mobile phone reviews
so this will be one for Tim like a lot
of different Android phones and stuff I
did really appreciate your s9 and
benchmarks so again I'm glad you enjoyed
those benchmarks but yeah it's something
we looked at doing but we're a bit busy
doing all the other stuff we have to
cover really it's yeah it's really only
battery life as well that matters when
it comes to benchmarking so yeah
something we'll continue to sort of look
into a little bit but probably not a
topic of that we're going to be doing
too much on yeah you might touch on it
but it won't be yeah regular content as
you say yep all right next question stop
play with your phone - okay the next
question is what's the game you've
played the most well as I sort of spoke
about earlier or alluded to earlier
Starcraft 2 I've invested an
embarrassing amount of time but that
guy's been out for a long time and I've
planned over many years but that's
definitely the game I've played the most
and what about you yeah I don't like I
said I don't really stick to one game
and tend to play it just speak to that
and play it forever I just play a
variety of games really like to
experience a lot of different things I
do play multiplayer games of fair bit so
I guess maybe back in the xbox360 year
when I had call of duty black ops a play
that got to about fifth prestige with my
mate so that took a fair bit of effort
to get up to that so that's why we were
down and played the most but yeah just
buy lots of stuff really how do you
manage to compare benchmark performance
with so many different computer parts is
it a trade secret or are you guys just
level 12
okay well promise not to tell Steve from
gamers Nexus this we don't want to help
him out any more than we have to but I
would say it's a lot of coffee late
nights and an unhealthy addiction to
benchmarking so sorry about that car
none of those things
Steve would be aware of this is a
question from Thomas on YouTube what is
done with all the sample products that
you test after you test them also we
ever do a fan meet up people would show
up it's good to know well firstly thank
you for the vote of confidence Thomas we
haven't really ever discussed a fan made
up didn't you realize that was a thing
that you guys would attend to attend
rather but maybe that is something we
could do
we've got packs later in the year so
we'll probably run into a few guys there
and pax Australia that is really yes I
would be more than happy to talk to
anyone that wants to talk to us as for
the samples hang on a minute he I think
I know what he's done to he very very
interesting to questions to ask you the
one question so you want to meet up and
then you want to know what we do with
our samples okay I don't think I'm I
think I'm onto you Thomas but seriously
pretty much the samples the important
things we keep like you know tim has a
lot of stuff here you can see on display
he's got his gaming boxes at the top and
he'll use them to test don't pretty much
sit there now till you get the
next-generation gaming boxes and yeah
you'll compare them so a lot of the
stuff we just keep around graph I've got
so many graphics cards that we use for
comparing to new ones and you throw
backs and it's great when you guys say
hey Steve I want to know what this has
well core i3 compares to this and I've
got that CPU and I can test it so yeah a
lot of retesting of course there's some
stuff we don't know that sort of gets
palmed off here and there to friends and
family and stuff like that fan meetups
all right so this question comes from
our discord Channel you can get access
to that through our patreon page and one
of our most prolific members you'd have
to say Sal Kagan has asked us where you
guys think things are going in CPU GPU
and software slash games in 2019 based
on the trends and the current state of
things in all of those areas okay
anyways my ask the hard ones really is
hard to say historically the development
on the game so I've been pretty slow but
then it's hard to know whether we should
blame game developers because things on
the CPU front haven't changed for almost
a decade so it's really hard to know
what to expect there now that things
have got moving I don't know whether the
game developers will be quick to start
updating the engines and making new
engines that take advantage of things
like eight core eyes and processes or
whether they'll still remain a bit
conservative because they also have to
make these games work for everyone so
it's really hard to say whether we I
think 2019 is probably was 2019 wasn't
it yeah yeah it's probably going to be a
bit too early to see any major change
but hopefully we start to see better
utilization of these you know six and
eight core CPUs and at least beyond 2019
I hope that we start to see this pick up
at a bit of a quicker pace so that'll be
very exciting yeah I think the CPU and
GPU is specifically where those going to
go in 2019 it's probably pretty similar
to what we thought this year I don't
think there'll be any revolutionary
changes that will be coming out be the
usual stuff you know moving to a new
node 7 nanometre we'll be ready around
then you know adding more cores clocking
them higher that's always usually what
they're trying to do so yeah I think
we'll see similar stuff in 2019 in that
path yeah hopefully it's a decent step
yeah and they can continue on from there
as they always do but yeah if anything
would just be exciting for benchmarking
yep and gaming ok next question this is
a good one with these new 4k 144 Hertz
HDR monitors being released how long do
you think it will take to have
affordable GPUs that can play games at
that resolution with those refresh rates
at Ultra quality settings or 4k 144
Hertz all to see if that's still a long
way off or even modern flagship cards
like the top-end $1,000 GPUs really
can't do that now so it'll be a couple
of generations before the top-end cars
will be able to do that and then for
affordable cards probably like a long
way to the future and even then like
games get more intensive to run over
time so you know might always be just
the top-end cards to do one 4k 144 Hertz
you know unless you're playing fortnight
or so
thing yeah it's gonna be very difficult
without having really high-end hardware
for many many years yeah as Jim says
sixty Hertz is a bit of a struggle with
the modern games at 4k we're not really
I don't think we're in a resolution race
where we're trying to keep pushing the
boundaries of resolution because you can
really make games look significantly
better at 1440p so yes nice to have that
option there but yeah no time soon all
right so final question for the Q&amp;amp;A if
it's not trade secrets could you tell us
a bit about how you benchmark even if
it's just the things that aren't trade
secrets I'm thinking about what programs
you use and how you extract the numbers
afterwards how you decide things for
each game it's not just using the
presets and do you actually game or use
scripts for a controlled run that sort
of thing so like you know most of the
stuff isn't actually like a trade secret
is just industry standard practices and
lots of hard work I think mostly for
gaming benchmarks views like fraps okat
and present mod and time to time for
Game Capture isn't it's basically just
Excel for crunching all the numbers and
making the graphs the settings you know
you would have seemed that we mostly
stick to presets because most gamers
sort of just use presets and then we
just sort of choose presets appropriate
for the hardware going to the games play
them you know loop a section of the game
tend to you know if there's a can
benchmark we might use it depending on
how representative of the real game it
is but yeah I think that's basically in
yeah you could really spend a lot of
time answering that one in detail but I
think Tim's covered it pretty well and
things like presets well I know a lot of
people don't like it's using presets for
various reasons some games it doesn't
make sense and we tweaked them a little
bit if there's a silly getting in there
that kind of wrecks things but the
presets just make it easier to not just
for us to load the settings in and make
sure it's all you know apples to apples
cause even when we load a preset we sort
of go through and check the Advanced
Settings and make sure they're all okay
but it's just easier for you guys to
know exactly what settings we're using
if we're using the ultra preset and you
set the ultra preset it's the same
conditions you don't have to go through
30 settings to make sure everything's
lined up yep I think that pretty much
covers it all right and that's it for
this month's Q&amp;amp;A plenty of questions
that we answered in this particular one
don't forget to go back and check out
part one of the Q&amp;amp;A if you miss that and
do
the good stuff like subscribing to this
channel and liking the video consider
supporting us on patreon where you can
ask us questions anytime you like in our
discord chat and I guess then we'll
catch you guys right in the next one
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
