you guys think Saints Row 2 was bad
what about watchdogs that horrible
release day performance and uninspired
graphics were you appalled by the
hardware requirements of mafia 3 a game
looks like it could have been released
years ago and well let's not forget
about Batman Arkham Knight that actually
lets let's forget about that man arkham
knight i don't think Dishonored 2 is
that bad they're probably not going to
be pulling it from shelves just yet but
yeah if you haven't heard Dishonored
two's pc port is extremely buggy it's
plagued by performance problems glitches
bugs and all that stuff that just pisses
gamers right off speaking of pissed-off
gamers they are once again taking to
these steam reviews to vent their
frustration in the form of negative
reviews which are heavily outweighing
positive reviews at this stage or at
least they were and it's a shame because
even those that are bashing the
developer for releasing yet again
another polygon PC they admit the game
itself is a heap of fun
- the performance issues even for those
of you who are invested heavily in a
seriously high-end rig with like you
know a core i7 6700k or greater
Pascal Titan X you still want to notice
input lag and crazy fluctuations in
framerate this kind of thing really
isn't acceptable for a triple-a title
especially when it costs $80 u.s. still
had publisher Bethesda been quick to
acknowledge these issues and a sure game
as a fix was incoming we might have been
able to cut them some slack
of course what did they do instead
basically told PC gamers to get
realistic and work out what their
systems are actually capable of in an
official statement they said that PC
gamers should simply reduce the quality
settings to level more reasonable for
their hardware thankfully it sounds like
they're now backpedaling and actually
looking into the various issues Arkane
Studios the developer behind Dishonored
2 is currently investigating reports of
major performance issues facing players
on the PC platform so an update to
address these performance issues might
be in the works for now though since so
many of you men are asking for us to
provide a performance video we've
decided to take a look at just the
current generation GPUs as usual the
core i7 6700k test rig has been used
along with the latest AMD and NVIDIA
drivers for testing the ultra quality
preset was
used and given the visuals we don't feel
this quality level should be overly
demanding gamers have also reported that
scaling back the quality settings
doesn't actually help with performance
anyway so we've thought here is a look
at the benchmark pass which lasts just
30 seconds yeah we did a bit of a quick
test for this one once the game gets
patched up we will benchmark again using
a 60 second pass and a wider range of
hardware
your face is covered underground market
illegal trade me hey we say that at
1080p with image quality saying is
cranked up those rocking a gtx 1050
series or RX 460 series graphics card
we'll need to reduce their quality
settings meanwhile mid-range contenders
such as the RX 470 480 and gtx 1060 all
averaged over 50 fps and the 6 gigabyte
1060 even broke the 60 FPS barrier
however the minimum frame rates did dip
down into the low 40s in fact in the
case of the RX 470 we went as low as 36
fps stuttering was noticeable on both
the AMD and NVIDIA GPUs though though I
have to say it was a little more
noticeable on the radians moving to
1440p we find the mid-range GPUs really
do struggle and while just playable
frame dips down into the 30s were
noticeable the GTX 1070 played fairly
well though again we did only run a
short test here and yet we saw a massive
swing between the minimum and average
frame rate the GTX 1080 and of course
the Titan XP delivered much more
consistent performance in the game's
current state playing a 4k isn't a great
experience even with a GTX 1080 in fact
even with a Titan XP the game wasn't
exactly smooth at all times despite
never dipping below 50 fps so
unfortunately for now it looks like
Dishonored 2 is one of those games that
was designed for console and then made
Windows DirectX 11 compatible as an
afterthought so I think it's safe to say
we have yet another dodgy PC port on our
hands graphically the game does look
quite good but of course shouldn't
demand the kind of hardware that it does
right now in order to enjoy Dishonored 2
and all of its glory gamers really need
a PC so powerful it makes the lights
flicker when booting up AMD and NVIDIA
both look to be doing all they can to
provide their customers with the best
possible experience in this title
performance wise they are both pretty
well on par instead it's the game itself
that needs work a few performance
characteristics that we noticed which
might be causing issues for gamers is
the fact that Dishonored 2 is a real
memory Pig using the Titan XP for
example vm allocation went as high as 6
gigabytes at just 1080
P and with 32 gigabytes of system memory
or RAM available the game was eating up
around 8 gigabytes this could also be
the reason why gamers are reporting
barely a 5 FPS difference between the
low and ultra quality presets the
situation really does suck have
Dishonored 2 not been plagued by these
performance issues on the PC it could
have been a great game and something
that gamers could have truly enjoyed but
for now the gtx 1070 is delivering less
performance in Dishonored - then say the
gtx 1050 to own a game such as doom so I
mean that pretty much says it all right
there anyway over to you guys let me
know what you think in the comments I'm
keen to read your thoughts and discuss
things further I'm your host Steve don't
buy Dishonored 2 just yet I'll see you
guys next time
what do I have to do to help my father
what do I have to become</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
