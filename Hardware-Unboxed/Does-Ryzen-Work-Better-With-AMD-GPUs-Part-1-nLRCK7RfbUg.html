had planned to address Verizon 7 memory
scaling performance but for now that's
been put on the back burner though
testing is almost complete and the
results are very interesting so
yesterday morning when I got out of bed
there were several dozen comments emails
and Twitter messages from you guys
asking me to test Rison using an AMD GPU
or perhaps even two with so much demand
for these tests I decided to do them the
faster single GPU on hand from AMD right
now is the fury X and since that
delivers similar performance of the
geforce gtx 1070 i decided to compare
them using the Rison 7 1800 X it seemed
that DirectX 12 games we're in demand
and oddly at the top of everyone's wish
list was rise of the Tomb Raider I say
oddly because this is a game I consider
quite poor for measuring system
performance in particular CPU
performance in fact there was a good
reason why it wasn't included in my 16
game horizon performance video a few
weeks ago the request was they also test
a single level of the game called
geothermal valley so I have I actually
didn't really have many requests to test
other DirectX 12 games which seems a bit
strange
testing one level of one game seems kind
of limited and definitely not the
hardware unboxed approach so an effort
to cover my bases I also throw in hitman
Deus Ex mankind of audit ashes of the
singularity escalation Tom Clancy's the
division and some alternative testing
with battlefield 1 and Far Cry primal
now don't expect to see too much or any
Intel CPU testing here really I wanted
to focus on Rison and how it works with
the fury acts and gtx 1070 i didn't want
to risk turning this into another AMD
versus intel clash though i can add
those results a bit later if need be at
this point pretty much every day next
week is booked out already the channel
has gotten a bit crazy lately and it's
demanding a huge amount of my time for
multiple projects anyway with the
limited time I have available right now
this is what I be able to put together
for you guys before we jump to the
results please note that both the
horizon 7 1800 X and core i7 7700 K
processors will locked at 4 gigahertz
with any kind of power saving or turbo
boost type features disabled so
basically the horizon 7 CPU was
overclocked and the 7700 K was under
clocked though please note I only can
the Intel CPUs performance in
battlefield 1 and a single rise of the
Tomb Raider test both CPUs were running
with ddr4 29:33 memory ok so starting
with hitman things are very much like
what you would expect to see in video
recently improved their DirectX 12
performance in this title as you can see
the gtx 1070 was 7% faster than the fury
acts when comparing the average frame
rate similar margins are also seen when
testing with the dx11 api so nothing
unusual here the division was tested
using the ultra quality settings which
mostly loads up the GPU to be honest
that said we are testing at TEP the fury
does enjoy strong performance gains when
using the DirectX 12 API though that's
not surprising that said the GTX 1070
was also faster using DirectX 12 though
the gains weren't as substantial again
nothing looks out of the ordinary here I
have tested Deus Ex mankind divided
using both the canned benchmark as well
as in-game performance using present Mon
here we can see the canned benchmark
results and it's interesting to see if
the Fuhrer ex takes quite the pounding
on the minimum frame rate that said once
again the gtx 1070 is slightly fast
using DirectX 12 when compared to
DirectX 11 still the margins are much
the same between the fury x and gtx 1070
using either API moving to in game
testing towards the start of the first
level we find a fire less demanding
situation the fury X isn't plagued by
those low minimums now that said the gtx
1070 is still the superior performer
even when using DirectX 12 again the
margins are much the same at least when
looking at the averages a game of been
keen to test with ancho uprisings new
found form as ashes of the singularity
escalation that testing is still to come
and you will likely see it in my rising
5 coverage what you'll see here is the
fury X getting completely annihilated
when using DirectX 11 moving to DirectX
12 the fury ax performs much better
though it is once again the gtx 1070
that is able to extract the most out of
the rising 7 1800 X processor okay now
for the rise of the Tomb Raider testing
which you guys have all been requesting
first we'll look at the results from the
can benchmark focusing on the geothermal
valley section of that benchmark running
DirectX 11 the gtx 1070 was 29% fast and
if your ex keep in mind this is an
nvidia sponsored title that said though
AMD how
made great strides here at least with
the rx4 ad from what I've seen from
previous tests anyway moving to DirectX
12 we now see the gtx 1070 is 23% faster
so the margin was reduced somewhat that
said once again the gtx 1070 is getting
the most out of the 1,800 x initially I
tested the start of the geothermal
valley level but found the frameworks
were quite high quite a bit higher than
those from the built in benchmark the
shocking part here being that the gtx
1070 was now 41 percent faster than the
fury acts when using DirectX 11 though
it was only 27 percent faster for the
DirectX 12 test right so this test takes
place right after the first cutscene and
runs to 60 seconds it is considerably
more demanding than both the previously
seen tests the margin between the gtx
1070 and fury ax has been reduced though
the GeForce GPU was still 26% faster
using DirectX 11 and 21 percent using
DirectX 12 so we aren't even seeing the
fury X match the gtx 1070 in these
titles using an overclocked verizon 7
processor before we move on to look at
the gameplay footage compared
side-by-side here is a quick look at how
the 7700 k and 1800 x compare in the
same section of the geothermal valley
level using a single GPU the margins
look much the same using either the AMD
or nvidia hardware so there isn't much
more to say here really let's move on
now the support the testing done so far
here is the geforce gtx 970 and radeon
r9 fury x running side-by-side in the
very past we just looked at the results
for please note the DirectX 12 API is
being used there are some interesting
things to note here other than the fact
the gtx 1070 is consistently ahead in
terms of framerate performance you will
notice that the CPU usage is
considerably higher when using the gtx
1070 though that makes sense giving it
is delivering stronger frame rates as
for the GPU utilization please note that
the first percentage figure on the gtx
1070 side is showing power i should have
an ticked this feature and rivatuner to
avoid confusion anyway be aware that's
what you're seeing here after the
temperature we have the actual GP
utilization figure you will notice that
for the most part the fury X is pegged
around a hundred percent while the GTX
1070 often dips down into the 80s in
fact it really hits 100% in this past so
with a higher
soft CPU there is a good chance you will
see more performance for those of you
interested here is the same pass using
the DirectX 11 API again CPU usage in
general is high when using the gtx 1070
though at times the fury x does creep
ahead it's certainly closer than what it
was when using DirectX 12
that's it even with DirectX 11 we still
see fairly even loading across all out
cause you also notice that the threads
aren't as heavily utilized the threads
being even numbers and the cause odd GPU
utilization jumps all over the place
using DirectX 11 and it's rare that we
see the gtx 1070 exceeding 90% before
wrapping up the testing i have just a
few extra things i would like to show so
there have been some very interesting
reports that the Radeon our X 480
crossfire graphics cards deliver
exceptional performance on the horizon 7
platform and allow it to push past what
the GeForce graphics cards are capable
of seems far-fetched based on what we
have just seen but is it true well
unfortunately I don't have to rx4 80s
right now I did a few days ago but I
sent one of them off to Thermaltake with
the Rison 7 giveaway PC that you guys
will be able to check out next week and
of course one of you will be able to win
what I do have laying around is this old
relic the jackhammer of graphics cards
AMD's epic Radeon r9 295x2 essentially
what we have here is a pair of 290x GPUs
teamed up on a single PCB so in terms of
performance this should be similar to
the rx 480 duo since a pair of 290x GPU
should be faster than the GTX 970 I swap
that out for the Titan XP let's go see
what we found
now you would expect the Titan XP to be
faster than the r9 295x2 for the simple
fact that it is in over 90% of the games
out there particularly when testing at
1080p however here it's not in fact it's
a good bit slower at least when using
DirectX 12 the 295x2 is at times up to
27% faster and it's allowing the horizon
7 1800 X to hit frame rates previously
thought impossible given the Titan XPS
performance although Seifer utilization
is often higher when using the Titan XP
what you will notice is that something
is stopping the NVIDIA GPU from hitting
full stride on the horizon platform
while the dual GPU 295x2 does a great
job of keeping all 5,000
132 stream processors occupied the same
can't be said for the Titan XP and its
3584 CUDA cores the Titan XP utilization
is shockingly low rarely does it reach
70% in fact for the most part
utilization can be seen hovering around
55 to 60% so I imagine we could boost
the Titan XP framerate by 30 to 40%
taking that into account and that would
place it consistently ahead of the r9
295x2 so this certainly looks to be some
kind of bug here you might be thinking
the Titan XP will be fast using DirectX
11 well no in this title that's not the
case in the gtx 1070 and furia
comparison we saw that when using
DirectX 11 frame rates drops for both
GPUs that said crossfire support appears
to be almost broken using DirectX 11 and
as a result the r9 295x2 is all over the
place it was basically a stuttery mess
we notice the Titan XP isn't performing
anywhere near its full potential on the
horizon 7 platform and I'm not going to
speculate as to why this is it just
seems to be some kind of bug for now
though let's compare it side-by-side
with the gtx 1070 a GPU should be at
least 40% faster than at 1080p instead
what we see here is that at times
performance is exactly the same in fact
at the most the Titan XP only manages to
pull ahead by 12% I also thought it
might be a good idea to check out some
DirectX 11 titles one tile has shown
really poor performance on rising CPUs
as Far Cry primal here we see that when
using the gtx 1070 and fury x on both
the 1800 x and 7700 k cpus both of which
are clocked at the same 4 gigahertz
frequency we see that even with the fury
x the 1800 ex still falls behind the
7700 k by a slim margin what we are
seeing here is a GPU bottleneck so what
happens if you emulate Titan XP light
performance by lowering the quality
settings and resolution does this see
the fury ax pull ahead on the rise and
platform here we see that no that isn't
the case the 1800 X imposes a CPU
bottleneck at around 120 fps which as we
have said in the past is still very
acceptable but not a true reflection of
Verizon's true gaming performance either
the 7700 K on the other hand clocks just
4 gigahertz pushes well ahead with both
the GTX 10
seventy and fury X having seen how the
Titan XP and r9 295x2 compared a rise of
the Tomb Raider I was very intrigued and
wanted to test some more games or more
DirectX 12 games I was pressed for time
though so they'll probably have to be a
follow-up video at this point the
biggest issue I had when trying to
conduct that testing was the lack of
crossfire support in those games for
example Deus Ex mankind divided wouldn't
work at all in either DirectX 11 or
DirectX 12 and I wouldn't work I mean it
was a stuttering mess so that was
disappointing for me right the Tomb
Raider looks to be an outlier or at
least that level of the game I actually
don't have any other results to go on
for this title right now as I never used
it for CPU benchmarking and I certainly
didn't include it any of my original
Rison testing the game is well known for
its poor optimization which is a shame
giving how amazing it looks I'll admit
the r9 295x2 results are very
interesting but I don't think this one
game tested using one level is enough to
say that in video GPU is a handicapping
Rison I'm pretty sure that isn't the
case what I wanted to test was a game
that I knew was well optimized for both
Nvidia and AMD hardware and didn't
suffer from poor optimization for me
that title was battle through one at
least when using the DirectX 11 API even
at 1080p the Titan XP was often pushed
to around 90 percent utilization using
the 77 okay and here we see it
delivering very impressive frame rates
on both the 1800 X and 77 or okay
meanwhile the 295x2 utilization was all
over the place it's safe to say
crossfire isn't working correctly here
either I have red mixed report online
surrounding battlefield ones crossfire
support most seem to be seeing the same
kind of performance issues that I am i
almost never play around with crossfire
or sli is I think both technologies
leave a lot to be desired and you guys
should definitely avoid them unless you
have money to burn so I can confirm
there is some funny business going on
with the Nvidia base GPUs and rise of
the Tomb Raider at least on the level
tested when using the Rison platform I
will be asking if they are aware of this
issue and if a fix is in the works okay
so a couple of things I would like to
just make note of all the game
performance figures that I have gathered
using Rison 7 today we are done using
the most up-to-date bias revision ddr4
29
memory and a fully up-to-date version of
the Windows 10 operating system all this
sees performance go unchanged in all the
gaming titles are originally tested in
my day one risin review so there hasn't
been a magical Windows 10 update quietly
pushed out that improves risin 7
performance I've heard this so many
times over and over again so I thought I
might as well address it likewise I did
test Windows 7 performance a little
while ago and found it to be a bust as
well still I don't know why people need
to keep making up stories or carry on
about Rison 7 gaming performance at all
performance is excellent particularly
given this is a brand new architecture
with no history already we're seeing
games such as ashes of the singularity
escalation and dota 2 updated to better
take advantage of Rison and the
performance gains are exceptional so
people really need to chill out and
enjoy the fact that we now have some
real competition on our hands as for my
rise in 5 testing I won't be including
rise of the Tomb Raider or Far Cry
primal instead I will be picking up
ashes of the singularity escalation
finally once amy has a gtx 980ti
challenger then we can do some serious
AMD vs. Intel CPU testing we could
probably also do some exciting game D
vs. NVIDIA GPU testing as well that's
all for this one guys I know it's a bit
of a quick and dirty benchmark video and
I did just slap this together over the
weekend in just under 30 hours so
forgive me for not going into the usual
depth if I didn't get this video out
today it might have been a week or two
before I have a chance to look at it
again so I hope this satisfies those of
you who have been asking me to check out
AMD verson video GPU performance on the
rise and platform I'm your host Steve
catch again soon
