Computex coverage now once again I'm
back at the msi booth but this time
something a bit different i'm checking
out some awesome new looking gaming
laptops they have on display so let's
get into it before we check the laptops
out a big thanks to msi for bringing me
here this year i wouldn't be here
without them if you're in the market for
a new gaming desktop pc then check out
msi high-end core i7 systems also right
now they are offering a free you play
game key for Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon
wildlands with select purchases it's
also possible to score yourself a
wildland game code with select msi
motherboards as well so check out their
x99 zed 270 and h2 70 range link is in
the video description
alright msi had plenty of new gaming
laptops on display at Computex 2017 the
biggest baddest and while beefiest of
them all was the MSI gt70 5v are
tightened bit of a mouthful but the
laptops even bigger than the name lights
on this new high-end gaming laptop can
be configured in one of three ways it's
possible and still a single GT X 1080
graphics card and this is probably the
way I'd do if I had a choice but you can
go with a single gtx 1070 or perhaps
even two 1070 cards in sli so that would
probably be the most powerful option for
laptops or sorry rather games but
support sli
the pair of 1070 s that is helping to
unleash all that GPU power is the Intel
Core i7 78 20 HK processor and that's
one of the more powerful cable HH CPUs
available right now in fact I think it's
the second most powerful processor the
GT 75 VR Titan also sports a really
slick looking mechanical keyboard with
customisable perky RGB lighting so
that's pretty special not many keyboards
that do have RGB lighting allow you to
change individual keys the keyboard is
the first mechanical type to be designed
specifically for a gaming laptop so
that's also very cool the msi gt80 Titan
for example the previous 18 inch point 4
monster did feature a mechanical
keyboard but that was essentially a
desktop keyboard
just crammed into a laptop the new Titan
however is considerably more portable
thanks to a 17 inch footprint and that
low-profile tactile keyboard the
keyboard was designed by SteelSeries and
MSI has been doing a lot with
SteelSeries with their recent laptops
and I have to say despite the low
profile design the tactile feedback is
excellent complementing the new keyboard
is a really nice Palmer s it has a cool
looking diamond-shaped cutout around the
opposite arrow keys the material here is
much softer than the hard plastic or
brushed aluminium that most laptops tend
to use it definitely improves comfort
and I'm sure for longer gaming sessions
where you are using the keyboard that
will really help a lot and I think it
really just helps gamers take advantage
of that mechanical keyboard msi tells me
there will be multiple 17.3 inch screen
options for the Titan the base model is
a 1080p TN panel but before you cringe
at the fact it is a TN panel it does
support a 120 Hertz refresh rate and MSI
are claiming HDR light colors I have to
say on the showroom floor with all the
lights and glare and whatever else the
colors still did look very vibrant for a
TN panel but of course we won't really
know how good the panel is until Tim
gets his hands on it for some real
testing still if you go for the GTX ten
eighty option or even the dual ten 70s
for that matter then perhaps the
optional 4k panel will be the way to go
it also offers 100% Adobe RGB coverage
so it should look very nice that said
though if you do prefer 1080p gaming msi
says they will be offering an IPS
version as well though no real details
were given at this point the Titan is
designed to be a full-on desktop
replacement with space for up to 64
gigabytes of ddr4 memory so I guess you
could make it a gaming / serious
workstation laptop as well and it also
supports not one but two nvme m2 SSDs
everything mentioned so far has been
very impressive but what really caught
my attention is the stuff inside and I
don't mean the GTX 1080 and the core i7
or gtx 1070 or whatever i mean that
stuff's all very cool but it's the stuff
keeping it cool that I was particularly
interested in thankfully MSI did have on
display their various cooling options
for the laptop so you've got a good idea
of what the cooling layout was and the
fans and the heat pipes and all that
stuff so that was that was very cool of
them so inside the Titan for example
they do have the new cooler boost 5
Titan technology and they say this
allows the CPU within the laptop to
overclock to 4 gigahertz and stay there
without throttling so that's pretty
amazing
the cooling system essentially combines
to whirlwind blade fans with 12 heat
pipes and for ventilation points so
again very cool stuff but I guess what
you guys want to know is the price and
unfortunately as you might have guessed
MSI aren't releasing that information at
this point for any of the various
configurations but you can bet they're
not going to be cheap another new laptop
series that caught my attention with the
GE 63 VR and ge 73 VR Raiders unlike the
Titan the Raider models are designed to
be cost effective or at least more cost
effective
they shouldn't completely obliterate
your bank account anyway the Raider
looks very sleek but it still packs some
serious hardware inside there also
packing the world's first 3 millisecond
120 Hertz display which doesn't just
promise super fast response times but
also a wider color gamut along with HDR
compatibility and this means you'll see
a broader range of colors with a better
overall contrast inside the Raider
models there's more cooler boost v
technology and this time we find dual
fans
seven heat pipes and for ventilation
points I know you guys are going to want
to know things like what temperature's
do they run out and how loud are they
and all that stuff and honestly on the
showroom floor I can't really get that
information you have to wait for the
reviews but MSI does assure me that the
operating temperatures are very good and
so too is the operating volume but again
we'll have to wait for Tim to get his
hands on that before we have any
concrete information something else we
don't know yet is which CPU is powering
the Raider line I would assume a
lower-end core i7 model is probably in
there there might be an option for a
core i5 but I'd say the focus will be on
the core i7 because the GPU has been
significantly upgraded they now come
standard with an nvidia geforce gtx 1070
and that's a massive upgrade over the
preview
ge62 and g72 s which use the gtx 1050
this is really impressive stuff because
despite the massive upgrade and GPU
power these new raiders are even slimmer
than the previous models as I mentioned
earlier these are very sleek looking
laptops and msi says that design shoes
have been taken from sports cars so as
Kevin would say that's interesting these
models also feature more steel series
action here we again have perky RGB
lighting so that's very cool and that's
for both the GE 63 VR and ge 73 VR
something that I am yet to touch on but
is very cool other speakers the laptops
feature the appropriately named giant
speakers which are said to be 2 to 3
times larger than other speakers in
similarly priced gaming laptops a key to
enabling this larger volume isn't just
the size of the actual speaker but also
the chamber msi says the chamber is now
five times the size and this results in
as I said a much larger volume but also
better audio quality overall and sound
detail I have to say even on the louder
showroom floor it was very easy to hear
the gaming laptop so I had them playing
a few games or videos and they were
incredibly loud so far the only
difference that I'm aware of between the
g63 VR and g73 VR is the 15-inch and
17-inch displays the GE 73 VR being the
larger of the two of course again
pricing information wasn't announced so
you'll have to wait for Tim's official
reviews to get those details
anyway that's going to do it for the MSI
laptop coverage hope you guys enjoyed
checking out the new laptops I'm pretty
excited to see Tim get a couple of them
and check them out see if they're as
good as they look on the showroom floor
I'm your host Steve see you again soon
guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
