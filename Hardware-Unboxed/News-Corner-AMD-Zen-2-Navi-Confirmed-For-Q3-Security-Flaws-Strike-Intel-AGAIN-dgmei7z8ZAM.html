corn had a few weeks off from presenting
the news thanks to getting sick then
moving house but I am back with a few
episodes before Computex kicks off in a
little over a week as Computex is so
close there haven't been many PC
hardware product launches this week
because they're all being safe for
Computex but there's still some
interesting topics so well let's get
into it everyone watching this video I'm
sure is super excited to see what AMD
has in store for us with their upcoming
third generation rise in CPUs and Navi
GPUs there have been a few leaks
floating me on the place giving supposed
to the specifications for some CPU
models but haven't been able to
conclusively verify that stuff yet so
not going to be the focus of this video
with that said AMD has confirmed at
their annual shareholder meeting the
both third generation and their all-new
Navi GPU architecture on seven nanometer
will debut in q3 2019 I don't think this
will come as a surprise to anyone q3 has
been right on the mark for some time now
and fits in nicely with their launch
event plans over the coming weeks
speaking of launch events there are two
events coming up for AMD that will be of
interest one is it Computex
their keynote there which was announced
a while ago and just this week aim D
officially announced their second event
next horizon gaming at e3 on June 10th
like the Computex event AMD's III
keynote will be live streamed so you
will get all the news as its announced
we're not 100% sure what will be shown
at either of these events but
considering the e3 event is just a few
weeks after the Computex event you'd
have to expect a neat split of
announcements between the two
considering Computex will have a lot of
X 570 stuff from motherboard partners
CPUs would likely be the focus of that
event so hopefully we will get rise in
3000 information there and then at e3
we're probably looking at the GPU side
of things with Navi not just for
discrete cards but also for consoles
given the technology will be used in
upcoming devices from Sony and
presumably Microsoft as well exciting
times for AMD fans of the industry in
general always nice to get some major
product launches to spice things up for
the second half of the year in not as
good news Intel has been hit with
another security flaw
originating from speculative execution
once again a bit of a disclaimer here
because I'm not a security expert so I
suggest reading the original article
from ARS technica and others that go
into more detail but I'll try my best to
summarize the issues here what we are
looking at our three new floors namely
Riedel or our IDL there's fallout and
zombie load and they are all closely
related to the original speculative
execution issues from January last year
called meltdown inspector the more
technical name for the new floors is
micro architectural data sampling or MDS
it has to do with gathering data from
buffers within the processor and
exploiting how those buffers are
utilized for speculative execution while
any sort of hardware related floor is
bad news one positive is that actually
using these walls for nefarious purposes
is difficult and would require many
attempts to gather enough useable data
and sort through that data from the
rubbish that's because there is not much
control over what appears in the buffers
that MDS exploits researchers from vu
Amsterdam did show a proof-of-concept
attack where a password file could be
read by MDS
however the attack required the system
to run a command repeatedly so that the
right data would appear in the buffers
intel says that MDS is already addressed
at the hardware level in many of our
recent eighths and nitrogen Intel core
processes which basically means coffee
Lake and whiskey Lake anything before
that is vulnerable though and until our
pushing up marker code updates for Sandy
Bridge and up to address the problem
there are a few other interesting
tidbits surrounding this story the first
is that fir onyx did some testing on
Linux with the cry 9 79 80 XE a
vulnerable Skylink X CPU to see what the
performance impacts are from software
side and microcode mitigations Intel
said it should be under 3% for the most
part although in some workloads it could
be higher for Linux found similar there
were a few tests where the performance
difference was massive but a regular
impact was maybe up to 5% or so I did
also see a report claiming that Intel
tried to bribe of EU Amsterdam into
downplaying the severity of the
vulnerabilities however when looking
into I'm not sure when the bribe is the
right word to use here the source is an
article translated from Dutch which
seems to suggest that Intel attempting
to pay out via their bug bounty program
and that payment being refused
constitutes a
the article also claims the video forced
Intel to reveal this floor now rather
than six months later not really short
the situation is there anyway enough
about this issue I don't think many
consumer platforms will up to include
the microcode fixes given the difficulty
of attack so I don't think there will be
many performance considerations for
everyday uses and apparently the latest
chips are safe anyway as for AMD they've
already stated that their CPUs are not
vulnerable to this sort of attack and I
believe it's the same for ARM chips as
well in other news a tech powerup for
remember allegedly found references to
both the Radeon rx 640 and Radeon 6:30
in the latest drivers these are said to
be straight rebrands of the rx 550 X and
Radeon 540 X so nothing at all exciting
here whatsoever but it does bring into
question what AMD might use as a name
for the next-generation GPUs will they
stick with an RX 600 series form in
range of products or choose to use rx
3000 like has been heavily rumored left
to wait and see on that one this is a
story from a couple of weeks ago that
just happened to pop out from my
timeline now and what is a bit of a
surprise Samsung is set to discontinue
their popular be die eight gigabit
memory chips in the second quarter of
2019 which is well I guess it's right
now there is no firm date set for their
demise but in samsung's latest ddr4
sdram component product guide BD is
listed as end-of-life while other dies
including CDI and DD an eight gigabit
capacities and a dice for sixteen
gigabit and thirty two gigabit are
living on beta as were very popular for
high in memory because of their
excellent quality and ability to clock
high with good timings a lot of people
when building a new systems specifically
seek out B dies for their memory to
ensure the best performance with beady
eyes getting discontinued it's only a
matter of time before they disappear
from the market completely and who knows
how many modules have been stockpile of
the big dim manufacturers also be
interesting to see where the next
generation of high-performance memory
chips are coming from whether that's a
different Samsung die or perhaps from a
different manufacturers so there's
definitely interesting times ahead for
the day Ram market there's also been an
interesting turn of events with the
launch of Rage 2 and I'm not really
talking about the mixed reviews here but
more the situation with the DRM users
quickly discovered that if you bought
Rage 2 on Steam you
would have had to deal with de nouveaux
DRM which is one of the most notorious
DRM technologies out there but if you
bought the game through Bethesda's store
and used their launcher you were playing
with a version of the game that did not
include de nouveaux whether or not there
was any performance difference between
the versions remains to be seen and it
could offer a good test platform to
finally see whether de novo really has
the big performance impact a lot of
people claim but in the meantime the
developers of Rage 2 noticed the
discrepancy between the versions and
well luckily instead of just adding it
to the pathetic version they did in fact
remove de novo from the Steam version so
at least that's a positive result for
gamers hot chips in 2019 is heading up
to be one of the most exciting shows in
years for fans of various hardware
architectures the event which is held in
August and known for its in-depth
insights into chip technologies has a
schedule that's absolutely jam-packed
with talks from all the major companies
on all their major technologies looking
through the schedule as kindly posted by
an air tech we can see that AMD are
talking about sent to Matisse very early
on day 1 and also deliver a keynote
address whether or not we get new
insights it will depend on whether AMD
will launch sent 2 before August but
you'd think so at this point then later
we have talks from intel on octane tsmc
on their no technology Intel again on 3d
packing in Lakefield
and talks from both Nvidia and AMD on
their chewing and larva architecture so
definitely fun times ahead the Epic
Games store everyone's second least
favorite game store after the Microsoft
Store of course has launched its
first-ever sale in an attempt to win
people over everything on the store
priced over $15 has received at least a
$10 discount including for pre-order
games like Borderlands 3 although we
still don't advise pre-ordering anything
at this stage there are other deals on
their life Metro Exodus for nearly half
prices not quite there but considering
the store doesn't have anywhere near the
amount of games as Steam and is still
trying to gain market share I don't
think we'll see any steam like super
sales for a little while that said it's
a good start and it's worth a browse if
there are any epic exclusives that
interest you in particular lastly we
have a bit of a monitor story for you as
followed by TFT central the newest seuss
tough gaming VG 32 BQ is the first
monitor on the mark
to support both variable refresh rates
and backlight strobing blur reduction at
the same time there have been plenty of
monitors that include both features but
to enable one you had to disable the
other so for those it like the increased
clarity of backlight strobing you can
only run it at a fixed refresh rate the
VG 32 VQ has a new mode called LMB sync
with LM be standing for extreme low
motion blur which is basically a Seuss's
brand name for backlight strobing here
you can combine adaptive sync it up to
144 Hertz with backlight strobing
although presumably there is going to be
a high minimum refreshers backlight
strobing often isn't very effective
below a hundred Hertz the fluid becomes
too obvious so will be interesting to
see how they handle that it's also
interesting to see as soon as expand the
tough gaming brand to include monitors
so hopefully you'll be able to get that
one into review in the coming months
anyway that's it for this week's news
corner one more of these to go next week
before the big show of the in Computex
both Steve and I will be flying over to
Taiwan to give you all the news and
tidbits from there subscribe to get news
corner in your inbox approximately every
week I guess except for the last three
weeks or so and of course we have a
patreon page as well for you to enjoy
I'll catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
