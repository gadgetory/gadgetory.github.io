for part two of the January 2019 QA
we're still sweating in here with that
how's it rate we talked about in the in
the previous episode but obviously if
you haven't seen part one go back check
that one out first cuz we always put all
the good questions that one we've all
those stragglers have heart to of course
yeah so this will be that as we the QA
not worth watching yeah this intro is
terrible anyway let's get into some
questions okay Sal Kagan has snuck in a
pair of questions into the one question
I suppose well I'll read out mine you
can read out yours so Steve what games
are you looking forward to benchmarking
in the near future well I'd have to say
this year I'm really looking forward to
team sonic racing it's gonna be a big
one so I couldn't give a straight face
now sir
seriously I'm looking I wasn't really
looking forward to it initially but I am
now anthem that looks pretty looks
visually impressive really impressive
out so at least as a GPU benchmark that
should be pretty awesome and then you've
got like Metro Exodus for a few reasons
looking in yeah I'm person excited for
that because it's the first ray-traced
global illumination game I don't see how
that goes that's one of the reasons why
I'm looking forward to that one
there'll be one that Tim and I can both
dive into VSO anthem and metro are
probably the two games that are coming
up fairly recently that I'm pretty
excited about benchmarking yes also as
for me what was your favorite monitor
showing at sea yes um yeah there was
some interesting miles I think a lot of
them were fairly typical like nothing
super crazy was was shown up in my
opinion I think it's the 1440p 240 Hertz
monitor the TN one I think Lenovo is the
first to release that that I'm sort of
interested in not necessarily because I
think 240 Hertz is all that necessary
I'm just interested to see you know how
they've managed to get that panel you
know 1440p up to 240 Hertz whether that
has any drawbacks or anything and
obviously it'll be pretty difficult to
drive
200 plus FPS 1440p in a lot of games but
um yeah that's probably the interesting
thing as well I think there were some
interesting ultra wide powers as well
that sort of are pushing non-standard
resolutions at higher refresh rates so
we'd seen you know there's been some
ultra-wide 16 10 or double-wide 16 10
panels at 60 Hertz now those are at 144
Hertz so that stuff's also pretty
exciting yeah well basically that leads
us into the next question from M Slice
who says if the discord chat is anything
to go by the monitor releases at CES
were pretty disappointing hmm it seems
most people wanted a 1440p or widescreen
27 32 inch HDR that was affordable and
what's your view on it and you think
more releases are to come this year to
quench the thirst yeah so this is a this
is a great question because a lot of
thoughts on where jazz going for desktop
Myers and my current theory with this is
that we're not seeing those affordable
decent HDR panels because companies can
get away with putting HDR on basically
anything so right now you can buy
there's so many models on the market
that are branded as HDR where that's you
know that's why HDR 400 certified or
whatever and so there's no incentive for
a company to make a you know entry-level
to mid range
HDR monitor that has actual good HDR
because they can just put HDR on
wherever so I think for a while until
that sort of gets resolved we're only
going to get HDR for high-end buyers
which will have features like full array
local dimming that is required to
effectively get good HDR so I think
that's going to be a problem for quite
some time and looking at the display
roadmap for what are you optronics LG
the main manufacturers have coming up it
definitely looks like that's although
their plans is that they're only putting
their full array dimming back lights
with their really high-end panels that
that could be like a 4k 27-inch or 4k 32
inch panel and that's going to be very
expensive so it could be a while till we
until we get that but I think similar to
the TV ecosystem where when TVs first
launched with hgr they had the similar
problem lots of
range TVs had terrible local do mean
terrible HDR whereas now you can buy
like a 600 or $700 u.s. TV that has full
array local dimming and really good HDR
I think it's going to take some time for
that sort of to filter down so yeah a
bit disappointing that they didn't go
with it this year but I still think
that's a few years off unfortunately all
right we've got a question here about
virtual link can the USB type-c virtual
link port on our TX cheering cards be
used for anything other than headsets
that support virtual link for example if
you put a type-c flash drive into it
would it really
has anyone ever tested this so when this
question was asked I went and tested it
kind of embarrassing that we never yes I
mean I guess it's just a USB C port you
don't really think too much of it yeah I
I assumed it would work just as a USB
port yeah and it turns out that does you
can plug in a USB device and it will run
it USB 3.1 gen2 speeds so that's the
capability that the port has and
basically when you plug in the headset
to use virtual link that adds in the
display port you know signals in there
as well to that so yes if you for
example don't have a case that has USB C
and you have a truant card you can just
plug in whatever your SBC devices in
there and it should work so really that
adds a lot of value to the RIT x-series
because it's it's a USB 3.1 hub
essentially yeah 101 yeah yeah one
device that's pretty good yeah they
should have bundled an RT X hub with it
yeah better than ray-tracing okay so
here is our top upload a question from
the youtube comment section so Steve how
many FX CPUs do you secretly own well I
hope they're any of them as secrets but
I think I have about six or seven in
total yeah I just love them yeah I know
I know this is just an attempt to
squeeze and an FX related question after
I said I wouldn't do them anymore to
keep them under your pillow like a favor
I can't I keep them near because I love
them so much
alright how far has Vega come since its
release where you can buy it now so
that's kind of good can radio and 7 be a
bit misleading at first time and then
crush everything with a drive
with driver optimization so basically
saying is out of the gate it may be been
underwhelming but is that misleading and
over time will it get better and better
to answer that one I think no I think no
I would say AMD is in a pretty good
place with their drivers at the moment
it's not where they're sort of fumbling
around and then all of a sudden you get
a big performance gain in this title
because they've worked things out or
whatever I would say for at least the
last few years
AMD's being a ride on top of their
driver game doing a fantastic job and
that kind of kills a bit of the fine
wine because we're getting the like the
art the RX for a tea for example we saw
pretty big gains a year later from that
thing with with driver development and
then we haven't really seen the same
with the rx 580 which is a refresh of
the 480 I think it helps that the card
is based on Vega as well so I'm sure
it's not a whole new architecture yeah
so I don't think so I think it'll come
out of the gate pretty much doing what
it's going to do of course there will be
driver optimizations for certain titles
here and there but you're not going to
see like a 10% gain across the board six
months later or anything like that so I
think the reviews on day one won't be
misleading in that sense I think it'll
be pretty much what it is ok these
questions from soya why have stock CPU
speeds stopped at four point five to
five gigahertz basically five key codes
for a single core really is it the limit
from or is the limit from silicon or is
it just not worth it because of extra
heat and power which is pretty much a
silicon limit yeah so yeah it's pretty
much the limitation of what we can
currently do with the materials being
used got nothing to add to that it's
pretty simple no I mean to get a higher
clock speed you tend to need higher
voltages but it gets to a point where
you can't just keep pushing the voltage
you get to a limit where beyond that
point starts to damage the hardware
itself so that's basically where at work
obviously they don't ship CPUs that are
right on that voltage of them it's
always a little bit below but certainly
even an overclocked version of these
chips only hit so that low 5 Q her train
yeah all the transistors can only move
so fast throwing more voltage at them
you get a voltage leak which adds to
excess yeah power usage there
and that's pretty much why we're stuck
where we're at at the moment all right
one of our longtime discord members
revel devil mm it's got another monitor
questions for me here what's your
opinion on the rise of 32 nine and
thirty to ten displays 3210 1440p looks
like a dream for certain software slash
productivity I had some pretty good
things to say about this but since its
addressed the team I'm gonna sit back
and sip some water
now you've been you've been banned from
giving an opinion on this one yeah my
opinions changed on these ultra wide
buyers when I first saw the 32 nine
morrow I thought oh that's ridiculous
like who would ever want a Monda that's
so wide it looks really stupid but when
you think of it as 269 miles or 16 10
monitors side-by-side it makes a lot of
sense because people have used that sort
of setup for a long time with multiple
monitors and this just condenses it into
the one display with no bezels that
sounds really good so yeah I'm a fan now
can I jump in with sort of a novice
noobish kind of question as someone who
is completely ignorant never used one
how do you go with because obviously you
can drag one window there one window
that's exactly as you say what if you
want to do for like you were doing like
you you know say how does that work yeah
I mean in that situation you probably
have to get special software to do that
yeah a lot of these mothers also have a
picture-in-picture mode so you can
actually have a 16:9 input on either
side okay so theoretically you could
actually just run two cables from your
PC and run them as to 16:9 Moroz and
then get the benefit okay having the
content either side the downside to that
though is if you want to use it for
gaming where you just want it to span
the entire yo to nine you would then
have to basically unplug it and plug in
yeah it's a bit clunky so yeah I think
yeah you there is software that can do
that though sort of set up different
zones on the monitor but that's
something that I guess continue to get
better but I quite like those sort of
models I think if you're get if you want
to 16:9 more ease you probably better
off with yeah it's the functionality
because I'd love to have maybe premiere
open in one then Excel and maybe Google
Docs or yeah something like that like we
cool if you could have you dedicate
those zones a bit better yeah I think
windows
need to you need some functionality yeah
so you need to do if you drag and hit
that point there it puts it there and
then that one and so on and so forth
yeah that's that's my only concern with
that but yeah and again I think it's
good that these monitors particularly
not just the 32 9 1080p monitors but all
sorts of models are now high refresh as
well so we can get you know a wide
variety of resolutions and sizes that
are also suitable for gaming ok there's
another question from revel devil 2001
of the straight-up worst experiences
with console so a guest gaming console
is the horrendous loading times of some
games battlefield 5 takes a minute or
two just to get to the main menu he
brings up AMD store mi is that practical
for next gen maybe it'll allow us to use
a small external SSD so it keeps the
cost of the console low yeah I'm not
sure they'll specifically use store mi
as named like that but I wouldn't it
wouldn't surprise me if the next
generation consoles had a small SSD
cache or cache for you know storing some
game assets maybe the game you're
currently playing with a larger hard
drive like a one terabyte hard drive and
potentially they'll use one of those
hybrid SSD SS HD yeah I think that
doesn't really help initial loading of a
game though does it yeah so I think
they'll need to do some more fancy
caching so that it's better the assets
that you want to use it such as maybe
they have a 64 gig cache will probably
hold most games and then have the rest
of it on hard drive that would work
reasonably well I'd be interested to see
what the the consoles do with that but I
think that's probably a way to manage
the expensive cost of SSDs with sort of
needing that performance goes you
wouldn't want another entire console
generation which would be you know seven
years of hard drive loading speeds on
games again so I think they'll probably
do something there yeah hot swappable
drives are you pretty cool yeah you can
already change out the drive on the good
consoles but so something you can swap
in an SSD and get much faster a lot of
times but I'd be hoping that they would
include some solid-state storage for you
know just out of the box I think that
would be good alright I've got another
question from YouTube
dodgy practice aside Nvidia have
consistently shown they're simply
waiting for AMD to catch up before
releasing a new product ie
the ten seven
ETI do we really believe na'vi will be
better than vega which was spoken as of
as a revolutionary product and turned
out to be somewhat underwhelming we all
want competition but it seems like aimed
at choosing market segments very
carefully because Nvidia are so far
ahead again we're really not sure what
Navy is going to bring in terms of
improvements over Vega but I do agree
that Nvidia tends to sort of keep what
they're doing to their chests and sort
of just release it whenever aim be sort
of gets their products out it's probably
even more just sort of moving defective
stock it's white where we see those
things later in the product cycle that's
what they're probably doing really yeah
but I certainly think that you know
na'vi will be coming before in videos 7
nanometre or eight nanometer and not
sure on that one
they're certainly their next-generation
parts on a new process from Nvidia will
be coming after Amy's Navi that seems to
be the case so it will be very
interesting to see how Navi stacks up to
current products mm-hmm as whether
that's an architecture that's targeting
the mid range or the high end we still
not sure but yeah be interesting to see
you know if na'vi only is catching up to
what shirring can do now then they might
struggle a bit when invidious parts on
seven enemy to come in because then
they'll be able to do their own set of
enhancements on that new process
technologies yeah which we're expecting
to happen there at least a generation
behind so yes and again we keep saying
this but they do need to do a family of
catching up in the GPU game and it
remains to be seen whether that's going
to happen with na'vi a future generation
or whether it just remains that their
generation behind for some time so I've
got a question here from YouTube as well
why is ray tracing mirroring VRAM usage
in battlefield 5 i've 2x20 66 gigabyte
is not enough to run this game at 1080p
ultra with DX r because if it's 6
gigabytes apparently digital foundry
looked into that all right
Resident Evil has a whopping 9 gigabyte
of VRAM usage on high setting us now as
well do you think it's safe to purchase
a 6 gigabyte card nowadays so I passed
that the second part on to Steve in a
moment but our
the mirroring of VRAM in battlefield 5
that's something that is I guess
interesting so I'm glad aintry heard
about but I suspect they probably have
to do something where they have the
assets duplicated to run the rate racing
pass and also the stand rasterization
passed previously that was all just done
mm-hmm
once so you just presumably only needed
the one asset pipeline for that with
rate racing you need two pipelines so
maybe that's why it's murdered I'm not
saying that's the definitive reason but
I think that would make a lot of sense
what do you think about six gigabyte
cards the older vram debate well it
depends on the game the quality settings
you want to use for something as
powerful as an RT X 2060 which we
haven't really tested yet so it's hard
to comment it does seem like it would be
on a knife edge there yeah you would
because the 1070 TI and 1080 that it's
sort of replacing where anger cuts yeah
that's right so yeah I don't know
there'll be interesting to do a few
tests which we will do but I don't have
any trouble believing that yeah it's
right on the edge and it won't be too
long before we start seeing problems
just as we we started to with the three
gigabyte 1060 causes all sorts of
problems with less than 16 gear bytes of
RAM so yeah like I said I can't really
say anything for sure but it does seem
like that could be a problem and it
certainly will be in the future
Joey always says or asks rather question
for Q&amp;amp;A where do you see look has he
used the right a chronology the wrong
acronym we're just talking about it's HW
you being and we don't officially
recognize that where do we see Harbor
boxed in two to five years these
questions always sort of get me a bit
because I don't know it's so
unpredictable in some ways like the
whole YouTube thing that it makes it
sort of sell out we don't have any goals
or mission or anything but I don't think
about it too much I mean I don't really
know where we'll be
we just sort of take it one year at a
time we just try to do the best content
we can make as much content as we can
and what happens happens it's hopefully
just continues going the way it
we did about 140,000 subscribers last
year which is pretty awesome views by
the end of the year were good it's got a
weed last year we started off really
well then the whole notification thing
happened in like the middle of the year
was just so so slow and then it picked
up again towards the end of the tide in
a little bit with prac cycles but there
was some weird youtubers stuff going on
there yeah but we don't really I mean we
don't I don't see the channel changing
or anything yeah I just like to think
that in two to five years we're just
doing the same sort of content but
better yeah I mean I don't think we're
going to have loads of staff or anything
like that I also can't see us doing
moving towards more mainstream coverage
like like a wines tech tips did over
time I know it's fine that he's done
that and he wants to do it and if that's
the content enjoys making that's
perfectly fine I mean a lot of stuff it
yeah it's all the same we're not
interested yeah I'm just I'm not
interested in it I just like to know a
benchmark stuff I would like to focus
more on that kind of stuff have Tim dual
sort of investigation stuff on visuals
and monitor reviews and all that or
whatever you just enjoy doing but yeah I
think hopefully in two to five years
it's going exactly how it's going now
that'd be nice well I guess we've spent
the well especially you before I joined
but you spent a lot of time making
hardware box viable to sort of you know
support us and everything and I think
from from here aren't just about because
that sort of already we've already
achieved viability at this point we're
still around
so that's yeah and yes just continuing
to sort of yeah make good content yeah
we sort of make it an enthusiast channel
we don't like I said when I go
mainstream we don't want to turn it into
a money-making machine a business or
anything like that hmm
yeah it's just what we're doing pretty
much all right and that's it for part
two of our Q&amp;amp;A we're not sure whether
we'll have a third part of this just
depends on how many questions we want to
put into each episode but potentially
you see a part three probably in a
couple of days maybe if I make it yeah
if you make it cuz yes we have a few
questions to answer and Stevie is
struggling big-time with the hate year
it's not even that warm in here but his
slam in the water
Lenny or whatever
as always you can subscribe for more
hardware unbox content give this a like
if you like our Q&amp;amp;A segments what else
do we say at the end of these views oh
patreon they guys subscribe as well on
YouTube yeah so yeah feel free to do
that and tribal patreon because then you
have us money and we can afford things
that good mood so it's always nice yeah
maybe we get some air conditioning in
here at some point with your patreon
money so yes support us there and yeah
we'll catch you in the very next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
