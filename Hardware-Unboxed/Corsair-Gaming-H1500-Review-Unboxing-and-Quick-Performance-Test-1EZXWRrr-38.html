host Matt and today we're going to be
taking a look at Corsair gaming's h 1500
USB headset the H 1500 is the cheap of
the two new USB headsets being offered
under the cause they're gaming brand the
other being the while it's aged 2100
from the spec sheet it pleases the apart
from the H 1500 being wired that you
were very similar products let's open up
the box and take a look at so first up
get a couple of sticker seals to cut
through and start unboxing five to sell
so couple layers of protection slide the
head through the soap our course has
gone some pretty bold bumblebee coloring
black yellow the left side miss you know
the cardboard USB cable use a twist tie
everybody's favorite tool unwrapped
it's very twisted get there eventually
box to the side the plastic bag coming
the other headband use the cable itself
so there's the USB controls you've got
volume down by your mum just mute in the
middle
pretty nice even bit of a rubber finish
to the buttons themselves through a mesh
covering on the USB cable understood
detective rubberized cap might get a
little plastic wrapped around it to
slide up there we are I'm sure some out
comfort wise I found their hedge 1500
pretty good here coverings a mesh which
is popping up my favorite but if you do
like the mesh and the inter probably
right up your alley probably the main
thing I did like is that the earpiece is
nice and large I absolutely hate it when
part of the cup is squashing my ears so
that was a real plus for me that my
newsfeed Rockets live volume wise they
were very loud out hit from and actually
found myself usually playing with about
forty percent which was plenty I can't
imagine anyone left wanting more volume
from these headphones as the ear carp is
mesh there was quite a lot of sound
leakage from his headset so you're
looking for loud headphones you can
listen doing the same
is up someone's sleeping then your mama
look elsewhere the microphone is about
where to expect from mid-range headset I
mean I think any complaints or
compliments from anyone on skype but uh
yeah I mean it's it's nicely in front of
your mouth I didn't have time but
stupidly close which was good and it
wasn't actually addition of just so
pretty mid-range pretty standard so the
big push by Corsair gaming with these
with this headset it was the art 7.1
surround now obviously I mean you're
never going to get anything close to
sitting in your living room with real
7.1 surround but also do it pretty well
but some of the other gaming headsets
I've heard suit like situational
awareness that you get is is a bit of an
advantage in some games so it's probably
worth having although in course has done
a pretty good job at 7.10 audio you
should dance put me off this headset a
simple reason that it's not optional
while you can disable the 7.1 audio you
can't get away from the fact that you
forced you to shave USB sound it simply
is impossible to use a higher rate into
screen sound card of course I made the
USB optional by using an adapter I would
have much preferred this headset the
would have been able to use my sound
card for example lunch tech did this
with a g4 xxx headset which featured
audio jacks for the USB mic which you'd
either be connected to the supply and
7.1 sound or to your pre-existing sound
card thanks for tuning in to another
episode of hardware box
I'm your host Matt this has been the
course a gaming edge 1500 gaming headset
