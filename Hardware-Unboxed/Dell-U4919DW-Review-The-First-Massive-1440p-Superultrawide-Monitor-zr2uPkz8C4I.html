looking at Dells latest super ultra wide
monitor the ultra sharp you 49:19 DW I'm
not sure if super ultra wide is the
official term to these sorts of displays
but they're wider than a standard ultra
wide so feel kind of works well here
maybe double wide or something like that
is more appropriate any case this thing
is very wide and pretty massive overall
in terms of specs it's a 49 inch monitor
with a 50 120 by 1440 resolution giving
it a 32 9 aspect ratio they might be
wondering why would someone want a
monitor that's so wide and the answer is
pretty simple
this display is equivalent to two
27-inch 1440p displays side-by-side
without a bezel between so if you are
planning to run with a dual screen 1440
piece set up something like the you
49:19 DW might be a better choice the
interesting thing about this monitor is
it's one of the first super ultra wide
1440p displays on the market we've seen
1080p class displays so 3840 by 1080 for
a little while now and in fact some are
even high refresh these days at 144
Hertz but we're only just now seeing
1440p equivalents come to the market so
it's a pretty new panel type and product
category as this is quite new some of
the features that exist with 1080 p
class dr. Weins haven't come to 1440p
models yet one is high refresh rates
there are some more scheduled for
release this year that will bring that
feature but for now we're stuck at 60
Hertz the other is any sort of adaptive
sync functionality so what we're left
with is a monitor that's more designed
for productivity and creative use than
for gaming I think this sort of
resolution has a lot of promise for
gaming but it's also really well suited
to working and multitasking because
there is so much screen real estate
and unlike 1080p Class variants the
resolution is very good which again
helps with loading the screen up with
apps and viewing crisp text and imagery
if you're sick of bezels and all the
other complications that come with dual
screen setups then something like the
you 49:19 DW could be what you're
looking for does use their standard
ultra sharp design language for this 49
inch beast so most of the outer shell is
constructed from simple grey offer
suitable
stick it looks fine but really there's
not much more to say here because dough
is letting the display do all the
talking what impressed me more than the
visual design is the build quality in
general the monitor is extremely heavy
and the process of getting in another
box is more complicated than most
displays I've reviewed but the end
result is an extremely solid product the
standard is beastly and does a great job
of stabilizing such a wide display
without much wobble it also features a
rock-solid height adjustment and tilt
feature on top of this the you 49:19 DW
is curved with a relatively light 3,800
hour curvature sometimes this can
introduce some complications into the
build process that leaves a few untidy
seams here and there but not with this
display it really is extremely well
built and I'd expect no less from dell
ultrasharp line 4 ports we're getting 2
HDMI ports DisplayPort and USB C input
along with a collection of us be in and
out pause one of which supports charging
and two of which are easily accessible
on the bottom left edge USB C is another
one of those nice office centric touches
as it makes it easy to hook up a laptop
with a single cable the monitor will
even provide 90 watts of charging power
in return
the only downside about the design are
the buttons that control the on-screen
menu though is using basic base buttons
rather than a directional toggle which
makes the menu hard to navigate with
that said there aren't very many
features in the menu to begin with so
it's probably not something you'll be
using all that often Dell has included
several Zoning options though to make
use of all this screen real estate
there's a basic picture-in-picture mode
so you can hook up to 16:9 1440p inputs
and have them each occupy half to
display but the software utility is more
impressive it allows full zoning of the
entire display into whatever
configuration you like which makes it
easy to snap windows into layouts that
Windows doesn't natively support like
say three across but that's just one of
38 presets in the app with the ability
to create any zoning array you like on
top of that it's a powerful tool that
makes great use of this display moving
into the performance section of this
review now and as this is a Productivity
focus monitor most of the metrics we'll
be exploring in detail again towards
color accuracy in that sort of thing
Dell says the monitor comes with 99
percent srgb coverage and a delta 8
accuracy of less than 2.0 out of the box
so we'll see
how fares in terms of panel tech the 49
inch screen here is an IPS LCD which is
the go to standard for professional
monitors the reason for this is despite
modest contrast ratios IPS allows for
the best viewing angles which is crucial
for car accurate work only superior
uniformity the contrast ratio of the you
49 19 DW isn't too bad at eleven sixty
to one that's around the upper end of
what IPS panels tend to achieve and
brightness is also suitable for most use
cases at up to 330 nits but the area I
was most impressed with is the excellent
viewing angles which you would expect
from a high-end IPS like this color
performance I'll admit I was a little
surprised about when I first run the
tests on that monitors out of the box
configuration by default the monitor
uses the standard mode which is the mode
Dell says is calibrated for srgb however
the white point is off rather than
clocking in at 6500 K the CCT average is
7 for 0 for K with the white point of
around 7000 K this gives the display a
slight blue tint relative to the
properly calibrated monitors I use on a
daily basis this sort of result isn't
terrible but it does lead to a grayscale
delta T average of 3.14 which is higher
than the ideal Sub 2.0 Delta II for
content creation the gamma curve is
decent which is good to see whoever I'm
not quite sure what happened here with
the white point but we'll get to fixing
that in a moment before that though we
have our color tests which are more
around the mark of what Dell advertises
in our saturation test the monitor
clocked in a delta average of two point
zero nine but it's only at low
saturation levels that the monitor
struggles and in our general color
tracker test the panel does sneak in
with the Delta average just below 2.0
these color tests are good not the best
I've seen but certainly accurate enough
for productivity and creative use out of
the box without needing to invest in
calibration tools
grayscale is definitely concerned but
colors at least are good unfortunately
there is no nice simple solution for
correcting the grayscale curve because
the monitor seems to have been
calibrated with this white point in mind
if we adjust the white point to a more
accurate 6500 K the cars get shifted out
of whack you can see that here the CCT
averages are more appropriate 65 88 k
though it's not perfect and then the
Delta II average is two point five five
so it's improved as well but we then
look at the color checker coverage
up to near three-pointer where before it
was below 2.0 and that's because of the
color shift as we drag the white point
back to accuracy I'm not quite sure
what's happened in the factory
calibration process this could be an
issue with just my unit or it could be
an issue that's with all of these
displays my results were also a little
worse than the calibration report
included in the box although that
reports still has grayscale c30 up
around 7,000 K and my testing takes many
more data points and really overall the
performance is fine especially for just
general productivity work thanks to
those color Delta he's around the 2.0
mark and for srgb coverage certainly for
creative workloads like video or photo
editing that I'd move into the next step
which is a full calibration using
display Cal I was very quickly able to
achieve outstanding performance from
this panel that's one of the great
benefits of IPS technology and you know
it tends to play very nicely with
calibration in fact the contrast ratio
increased slightly to twelve hundred to
one after high performance calibration
with all Delta e values below 1.0 Pedro
members can download the profile created
for this display although results will
vary as not all displays are the same
the other key thing to discuss is
uniformity by default uniformity is very
good for such a wide panel there are a
few issues with the very outer edges but
the central zone which is massive romana
of this size is well above average again
this is one area where you choose IPS
productivity or creative work over other
display technologies however the you
49:19 DW also comes with a uniformity
compensation option that improves
uniformly further this improves those
outer edges and essentially provides
perfect uniformity across the display
with that said it's actually not a
murder I'd use as bizarrely it
completely stuffs up color and gross
scale performance switching the mode on
half of the contrast ratio cause color
Delta is above 5.0 and butcher's
grayscale I'm really baffled as to why
this is the case but it does work as
advertised and improving uniformly maybe
these are the trade-offs required for
perfect uniformity in any case is really
not worth using in most use cases and
finally I just want to briefly run
through the response time metrics this
isn't a particularly quick panel coming
in with a greater great average of
around nine milliseconds but that's fine
for a 60 Hertz productivity focus
display there is a single overdrive mode
but it introduces overshoot so the
default option is the best use here and
the one
tested with the year 49:19 DW also
clocks in with around 7 milliseconds of
input latency that's not up there with
the your gaming grade displays but it's
perfectly acceptable for this type of
monitor and it's not annoyingly slow
either the dell ultrasharp you 49:19 DW
isn't going to be for everyone I think
the game is especially it's simply not
worth buying a Productivity focus
display like this even if it has some
cool new specs that you might want in
time 1440p double-wide will become an
option for gaming but a 60 Hertz maximum
refresh rate no adaptive sink and the
high price tag makes it far from the
best choice right now but gaming isn't
their target market the target market is
productivity office usage and creative
professionals for that market I think
this monitor gets a lot of things right
it sensibly built and very sturdy it has
neat features for office users like USB
C power delivery and lots of Zoning
options and it uses an IPS panel so
we're getting great uniformity in
viewing angles factory calibration is
good it's not perfect but I think it's
fine for offices that anyone doing color
accurate work should probably still seek
an independent calibration there lots of
benefits to this super ultra wide form
factor as well replacing two 27-inch
1440p monitors with one might be the
right call for your workflow you might
hate bezels or the inconvenience of
lining up and positioning two displays
most importantly you can ensure that
content looks exactly the same on both
halves of the display which you don't
always get with separate monitors and
overall I think this is a much better
option for productivity than a 1080p
class equivalent because the higher 50
120 by 1440p resolution does make a huge
difference the question in the end is
going to come down to your use case and
what you're after
at 1349 dollars this is not a cheap
monitor Dell will sell you to ultra
sharp 27-inch 1440p monitors for $350
each or two with premiere color for $600
each both options ending up less than
the total cost of this 49 inch super
ultra wide so you'll have to really want
the specific benefits of this single
panel solution otherwise a more
traditional dual screen setup will be
more cost effective I think for a lot of
people the benefits of a single panel
won't
outweigh the huge price increase which
leaves the you 49:19 DW as more of a
nature
but it's not bad overall so if you do
fall into that niche and want this panel
it is a quality option that's it for
