box so gaming laptops have become
increasingly popular over the last few
years and that's all down to one simple
thing you can now get a laptop that
provides a desktop light gaming
experience in a highly portable form
factor go on are the days of big bulky
ridiculous gaming laptops because
consumers were never really interested
in buying them but now that portable
gaming laptops like the GTX 1060 powered
razor blades are readily available
demand for gaming laptops is increasing
this is what makes max Q one of the most
interesting initiatives to come from in
video this year the company has realized
the buyers wants slim gaming laptops so
they've worked to create a hardware
platform that brings even more powerful
components and their respective cooling
solutions down to the size of current
gtx 1060 systems if you look up max Q
and video will tell you all about the
optimizations they've done to power
delivery components coolers drivers and
so forth to put powerful GPUs in slim
laptops it's interesting from an
engineering standpoint but for people
looking to actually buy a max Q laptop
here's the basic information you need to
know max Q brings the GeForce GTX 280
and gtx 1070 into an 18 millimeter thick
chassis with a cooler noise target no
higher than 40 DBA in other words
laptops that were previously only able
to include a gtx 1060 can now feature up
to a gtx 1018 with the cool that isn't
going to blow up your eardrums
these suits are OGIS effort E is the
flagship model for max Q it comes with a
fully fledged GTX 1080
along with an Intel Core i7 7700 HQ and
16 gigabytes of RAM inside a chassis
that 17.8 millimeters thick and two
point three kilograms heavy
this makes the Zephyrus the slimmest GTX
1080 laptop on the market and by a
significant margin - with this sort of
hardware it's no surprise the Zephyrus
costs twenty-seven hundred US dollars is
standard configuration my review unit
which bumps up the ramp to 24 gig and
SSD from five to over gig to
terabyte pushes the price even higher
now that I've had extended hands-on time
with you it's time to dive into the
unique zephyrus design the most
immediately obvious aspect is the
position of the keyboard we sit at the
bottom of the base in order to make room
for a large slab of components at the
top we've seen this designed before in
laptops that include deep mechanical
keyboards but here is purely to maximize
space for the slim cooler key to hitting
in videos Mac's key requirements the
cooling solution has another unique
component and that's the base that
splits apart when the lid is open to
ensure maximum air flow when sitting on
a desk it's a great idea from a
functional standpoint as it allows the
laptop to remain slim and prevent the
fan intakes from being obstructed but
from a visual standpoint the way the
base splits apart and the flimsy plastic
construction to the extended section
makes the zephyrus look kind of broken
even though it's not this part of the
Zephyrus design is in stark contrast to
the rest which is very solid and premium
in both look and feel most of the base
is constructed from a single piece of
metal with a matte finish and thankfully
it's without the crazy game elements or
unnecessary angles that a soos usually
includes in there ROG designs the
zephyrus looks quite sleek and
understated for what is a very powerful
laptop of course there are some areas
that a soos simply couldn't resist to
embellish there are red LEDs that
illuminate the underside of the laptop
and a red highlighted ROG logo on the
otherwise nice brushed metal lid with
the cooler placing vents along the rear
and on the left side of the laptop most
ports are found towards the front of
each side on left is the power port HDMI
2.0 2 USB 3.0 ports plus a 3.5 mm audio
jack and on the right you get a further
two USB 3.0 ports and a Thunderbolt 3
port the zephyrus is simply too slim to
include Ethernet though a soos does
include a USB to Ethernet dongle in the
Box one of the biggest concerns I had
with the Zephyrus design is the position
of the keyboard laptops I'd previously
used with front mechanical keyboards
weren't exactly comfortable to type on
thanks to the higher than normal
position of the keys and lack of a wrist
rest but a Susur solved both of those
problems with this laptop firstly the
Zephyr
is a slim machine so the keys are a
reasonable height of the desk
secondly they include a rubber wrist
rest in the box that can be placed along
the bottom edge of the laptop for
additional comfort the rest doesn't
attach to the laptop physically in any
way but just positioning it under the
keyboard can make a difference the
keyboard itself is pretty similar to
most other ultra portable keyboards in
that travel distance isn't fantastic the
keys do have a nice tactile response
considering the limited space available
some of the modifier keys are shorter
than usual to fit in the slightly
above-average speakers on the sides of
the laptop though this didn't seem to
affect the usability of the keyboard the
spacebar is certainly very generous as
well the trackpad is another point of
contention due to its odd location on
the right side of the keyboard
personally I don't mind the trackpad in
this location I find it pretty easy to
use and tracking performance is good
though naturally it won't be for
everyone it's good to see ass ignoring
this too and even including a wired
mouse in the box for gaming the trackpad
also doubles as a numpad and this
functionality works far better than a
similar implementation I use recently on
an MSI laptop the display you get with
the Zephyrs is pretty decent and well
suited to the hardware inside its a 15.6
inch 1920 by 1080 LCD panel from a
Optronics with the refresh rate of 120
Hertz and support for g-sync the display
uses IPS technology so viewing angles
and contrast ratios are better than at
an equivalent while pixel response times
are okay putting the display through our
usual array of tests reveals a maximum
brightness of 310 nits along with a
contrast ratio of 1225 to 1
the display is a bit too cold for color
accurate work due to a color temperature
of 71 26 K though a grayscale Deltora mm
value of 2.69 isn't terrible saturation
and color check averages of 3.36 and
3.92 respectively aren't suitable for
color accurate work either though
neither is outrageously terrible for a
gaming laptop of course the big selling
point to the Zephyrus is the NVIDIA
GeForce GTX 1080 you get inside although
there's also a gtx 1070 more available
the GTX 1084 laptop is identical to the
desktop variant with 2560 cuda cores a
rated Bruce clock speed
17:33 megahertz and a gigabytes of gddr5
x clocked at ten thousand megahertz with
nvidia smack secured design though the
gtx 1018 may not necessarily run at the
same clock speeds as other desktop
variants or even laptop variants the
design principles behind max q are
centered around delivering a quality
gaming experience within certain size
thermal power and noise constraints
Nvidia made it clear that max q laptops
use different performance and clock
speed profiles embedded in their GeForce
driver to ensure their targets are met
and for that reason we won't see max Q
GPU clocks that are as high as more
beefy gaming systems can deliver anyway
before I look into gaming here's how the
zephyrus performs in productivity tasks
while the Zephyrs is a slim and sleek
machine slenderness has never been an
issue for the core i7 7700 HQ and as
such the Zephyrus performs almost
exactly on par with other gaming systems
that use the 7700 HQ of course a range
of productivity workloads typically the
Zephyrs was anywhere from a couple of
percent slower to a couple of percent
faster and that's you know margin of
error type stuff the smle 61 is a pretty
speedy SSDs one terabyte variant -
pushing above the usual one gigabyte per
second read and write barrier we like to
see in modern laptops while random
performance doesn't blow us out of the
water or anything
achieving above 50 megabytes per second
random reads is a decent result
obviously though you're all interested
in gaming results so let's get right to
it
normally I'd started here with some
older games but let's be honest no one
is using a GTX 10 ahead of that top to
play Bioshock
instant so let's cut right to the chase
in rise of the Tomb Raider the zephyrus
performs pretty well average frame rates
are 8 percent better than the ROG GL 502
PS which uses a gtx 1070 and the same
cpu as the Zephyrus while minimum frame
rates are a whopping 63% better you can
see here the MSI gt70 3 VR as well which
is a GT X 1080 laptop that unfortunately
I only have average frame rate data for
the GT 73 VR does have a faster core i7
6820 HK CPU the rise of the Tomb Raider
is pretty GPU limited and here the GT 73
VR pulls away by a large margin
no kind of item is one of the best
titles here for than Sepphoris
performing on par with the GT 73 VR and
18% ahead of the GTX 1070 minimum frame
rates are strong as well so with the
g-sync display you're getting a great
experience here at ultra quality
settings hip man performs strongly with
maximum details averaging nearly 100 FPS
and pushing near 60 FPS with its 1% low
minimum frame rates aren't ahead of a
gtx 1070 laptop there is a total ear cpu
limited at time so this isn't a huge
surprise another cpu heavy title is
civilization of 6 which plays well on
the zephyr a set to maximum detail
levels 1% low frame rates are a good 18
percent faster than a GTX 970 gaming
laptop although averages aren't
significantly improves watchdogs 2 is
one of the few games I tested that
didn't see a massive performance
improvement over the GL 502 vs only
gaining a few frames on average and
hitting the same 1% low before the tier
is still acceptable at ultra detail
settings but I suspect people purchasing
a GTX 1080 laptop may have wanted better
results the final game I looked at in
detail is Mass Effect Andromeda which
hits a strong average of 83 FPS and a 1%
low of 52 FPS inside the demanding
tempest area of again at maximum quality
settings I don't have gtx 1070 data here
though the difference is significantly
faster than gtx 1060 laptops as you can
see we're looking at average figures
across all the games I tested there are
some interesting things to note
particularly when comparing the Zephyrs
to a gtx 1070 laptop with the same core
i7 7700 HQ inside here the Zephyrus was
typically around 10% faster when looking
at average frame rates though this
expands to 15% we're looking at minimums
comparisons between the GT 73 VR with
its GTX 1080 and the Zephyrus do paint a
more interesting picture here the GT 73
VI is 10% faster on average despite
having the same physical GPU inside some
of this is down to the faster CPU which
can present a bottleneck at 1080p but
some of the most GPU demanding title C
games around that 10% mark the end
result is that the GTX 1080 max Q is
always exactly between the gtx 1070 and
GTX 1080
in terms of gaming performance 10%
faster than the gtx 1070 by the gtex
1080 takes its own 10% lead while this
performance delta is certainly going to
disappoint some that want the best
performance out of their GT x 1080
laptop there are a few things to
consider I've already talked a lot about
this size and that's something to keep
in mind as the MSI gt70 3 VR I was
comparing the Zephyrs to is at least
twice the size then there's also the
fact you can I guess overclock the GTX
1080 in max-q laptops to bypass the max
to power thermal and noise restrictions
thereby unleashing the full power of the
GTX 980 chip inside provided there's no
thermal Headroom unfortunately I didn't
have time to mess around with
overclocking his efforts a su smartness
reviewnit back pretty soon but I do
believe there is plenty of headroom here
under the load of either 64 stability
test hitting the CPU and watchdogs to
hearing the GPU the CPU topped out at
around 88 degrees Celsius while the GPU
hit 77 to 80 degrees Celsius now I
wouldn't go overclocking the CPU here
and well it's not even possible anyway
but overclocking the GPU should be no
trouble at all with these sorts of
temperature figures provided you're
willing to put up with faster fan speeds
perhaps a bit of extra noise and higher
temperatures the other thing to keep in
mind though is the noise one aspect of
max-q design is a noise target of under
40 DBA for the cooler and the Zephyrus
easily hit this even under an IEEE 264
stress test as it's one of the quietest
gaming laptops I've reviewed now it's
not silent but most gaming laptops with
this sort of hardware are outrageously
laughs well under full load even slower
gaming machines like the Razer Blade are
deafening in comparison to this system
you only need headphones with the
surface and that's something I haven't
been able to say about many gaming
laptops even the laptops built-in
speakers can drown out the noise of a
sub topspin or as while gaming the Asuza
rog Zephyrus is an excellent example of
great engineering the ability to take a
powerful GPU like the geforce gtx 280
and slot it into a laptop chassis
previously restricted to gtx ten 60s
while hitting reasonable thermals and
outstanding noise targets is a huge step
forward for gaming laptops
anyone who purchases a Zephyrus should
be very happy with the
and I can't wait to see what other max-q
products we get in the future the price
for these efforts is just about perfect
as far as I'm concerned the left up with
the GTX 980 inside 16 gig of ram and a 5
to a gig SSD will set you back
twenty-seven hundred US dollars it's a
fair bit more expensive than mid tier
gtx 1070 laptops but cheaper than other
gtx 1080 laptops by several hundred
dollars i was actually surprised to
discover that the Zephyrus price fits in
so well with other laptops considering
its performance I was fully expecting it
to cost just as much as other gtx 280
laptops but with the excuse that it
comes with reduced performance as a
trader for increased portability so
there's no doubt that the service is an
expensive laptop but what it provides
it's hard to think of a better product
on the market right now anyways that's
it for this look at the seuss rog
