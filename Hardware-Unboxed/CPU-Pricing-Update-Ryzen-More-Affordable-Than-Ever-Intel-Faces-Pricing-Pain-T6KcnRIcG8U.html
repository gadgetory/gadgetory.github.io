this week we'll finally be able to
publish our benchmarks intel's new 8
core cpus like the 9900 k so of course
that's very exciting but before then I
thought it might be a good idea to check
out how CPU pricing has changed over the
last few months to see what products are
the best value right now and whether
we'll continue to see changes throughout
the rest of the year we haven't really
had a good reason to make this sort of
video yet we've done it for GPUs in the
past with prices that were fluctuating
all over the place but for a long time
CPU prices have stayed fairly consistent
Intel and AMD would launch their new
products that are certain MSRP and then
over time prices will drop slightly
until the next generation is ready to go
however right now this isn't quite
what's happening at least on Intel site
you've probably heard about Intel
struggles with 14 nanometer
manufacturing capacity in that they're
basically maxed out in fact just
recently Intel spoke about how they're
investing money to increase 14 nanometer
capacity and until that capacity spins
up the company is prioritizing high-end
higher margin products over some of the
lower end products budget chipsets in
particular rumored to have made way for
other chips so with Intel struggling for
capacity we're in a position where Intel
can't supply the amount of processes
they need this unbalances the supply
demand equation causing prices to go up
meanwhile on the AMD front everything
seems to be going smoothly for them as
far as most EPS are concerned no
significant supply issues and that
allows them to be more aggressive with
pricing we start with Intel pricing
though in this chart we have Intel's
most popular CPUs ranging from the
chorus of an 8700 k2 to the core i3 8100
and Pentium Gold G 5400 we also pricing
data for these products launch MSRP July
retail price at Newegg and current
pricing as of October 15 or prices of
course in u.s. dollars for current
prices we've taken the lowest price for
in stock products across a range of
retailers including Amazon Newegg and
several others before talking about
changes in pricing three products here
are much harder to find than the others
the core i5 84
and to a lesser extent the core i3 8,100
are out of stock at reasonable prices at
a fair few retailers the Pentium Gold G
5400 is more available but still appears
to be teetering on the border of stock
issues as surprising well as you can see
back in July everything was looking
pretty normal and all products were in
stock Intel's mid-range and budget chips
were usually available at the MSRP or
slightly below and it was typical to
find a $10 discount on chips like the 80
600 K and 8400 and the core i7 8700 K
was the most heavily discounted selling
for $30 under the MSRP
at an attractive 350 dollars but since
July prices have gone up for nearly
every product in this lineup the one
exception being the core i3
8350 K which I guess isn't a surprise
considering that CPU is pre poor value
as is some price hikes have been fairly
small beaker 580 600 K and a core i3
8100 have only risen by $10 and in the
case of the 80 600 K this only brings it
back to an MSRP level but for the best
products in the lineup the price
increase is not exactly great news the
core i7 8700 K has risen from three
hundred and fifty dollars to three
hundred and seventy-six dollars on
Amazon which puts it back up around the
launch price that's not terrible it's
still slightly below the MSRP but it has
completely reversed the downward trend
in pricing up to July one of the larger
hits though is to the core i5 8400 which
is well known to be the best value
product in Intel's 8th gen desktop
lineup three months ago 8400 s were in
plentiful stock at around 10 dollars
lower than its $190 launch price today
8400 SR out of stock at many retails
with the cheapest in stock CPU going for
220 dollars that's a 22% increase on
July pricing and 16% on the MSRP and in
this the G 5400 which used to sell for
75 dollars and now can't be found for
less than a hundred and ten dollars a
massive 47% increase that really hurts
the value of this budget chip over on
the AMD front though it's a completely
different story
not a single rise in CPU is selling for
above the MSRP at the moment in fact the
only chip that remains at the MSRP is
the
Rison 320 200g every other spew has
fallen in price the recently released
Athlon 200 genie is the only real
concern here it's currently out of stock
at most retailers and before when out of
stock it was selling for about 5 dollars
above its $55 MSRP the pricing trend for
AMD CPUs is clear in July you're able to
get a decent discount compared to the
MSRP for most products and today that
discount is even larger the Rison 520
600 X rise in seven 2700 and risin 7
2700 X are between nine and twelve
percent cheaper than the MSRP s at the
moment while the risin 520 600 has seen
a huge twenty percent price drop unlike
on the Intel side with the core i5 8400
AMD is very aggressively pricing their
best value CPU at the moment the 2600
with a price tag of just a hundred and
sixty dollars prices for eight core
rising CPUs are very good as well the
2700 is currently available for around
the same price as Intel six core six
thread core i5 80 600 K so this is a
very different market situation to when
these products launched even flicking
back to the launch of second gen rise
and we had slightly cheaper Intel CPUs
and full price rise and CPUs whereas
today the value proposition has swung
much more towards AMD's favor but how
much in AMD's favor well let's take a
look at some performance and value
graphs to see where everything falls
right now here we have data for blender
running on Intel and AMD s higher-end
processes this is data taken directly
from our original Rison v 2600 review
you'll see a mix of both stock and
overclocked results here although we
should note that neither the Intel nor
AMD platforms received any specific
memory timing or sub timing tweaks but
of course if you interested in full
performance breakdowns you can check out
our previous coverage of these processes
anyway in blender we had these stock
2700 X beating the 8700 K though Intel
claws back the lead when overclocked
though slightly
meanwhile the 2,600 and 2,650 400
with these results it's no surprise to
see AMD take a resounding win with
today's CPU prices their entire lineup
of risin 5 and risin 7 CPUs are better
value than intel's competing options
even the 2700 x is better value than the
core i5
8400 Intel's value champion and even a
5.2 gigahertz overclock for the 80 600 K
can't match the stock 2700 X 4 value
that's all down to raisins highly
competitive price and entails rising
prices particularly for the 8400 in fact
when we go back and look at July pricing
the 8400 is immediately much more
competitive in this workload it's not
rising 5 2600 levels of value but it
trades boy with other AMD processors
though AMD can handily reclaim the lead
when factoring in overclocking we also
see a situation where the 2700 X is much
closer to the 8700 K in terms of value
compared to current prices where the
8700 K is non competitive looking at the
budget end of the spectrum again it's a
strong victory for AMD the Rison 320 200
G remains a fantastic value CPU for
budget system builders destroying the
core i3 8100 from a value perspective
when stock and of course you can
overclock it to extend the lead further
the G 5400 is shocking value at its
massively inflated 110 dollar price
point but with the Athlon 200 GE mostly
out of stock it'll be interesting to see
how that conversation changes if the 200
GE returns with a higher price handbrake
isn't as kind to AMD processors heat
Intel's lineup outperforms there AMD
counterparts especially when overclocked
we're looking at value it's an
interesting chart even going on today's
pricing stock or overclocked the 8700 K
is still the worst value CPU and gets
handily beaten by the much cheaper 2700
X in terms of value the 80 600 K looks
okay when overclocked but realistically
it will be worse value than the risin
720 700 not seen in these charts which
performs around the same as the 2700 X
when overclocked but comes in at the
same price as the slower
8600 K and then of course we have the
horizon 520 600 which is by far the best
value CPU of the lot right now with it's
crazy a hundred and sixty dollar price
tag looking back to July and things
would be different the a 700 K is very
competitive with either the 2700 X or
2700 the a 600 K and 8400 are both
decent buyers and the 2600 isn't as much
of a clear value winner today of course
it's a very different story
we all know that AMD CPUs are strong for
productivity workloads how about for
gaming well here we have battlefield 1
in a CPU limited situation running at
1080p medium settings with a gtx 1080i
and we're specifically looking at the 1%
lower results intel's entire line up
beats even the fastest Reisen processor
in this test and there's quite a large
margin between the 2700 x and 8700 K
when overclocked even with today's
prices that heavily favored AMD Intel
remains competitive from a price to
performance perspective the 8700 K is
only slightly worse value than the 2700
X and will lose by a larger margin to
the 2700 of course an overclocked 8600 K
is a pretty good match value wise
compared to the 2700 other cheaper 2600
X while the 8400 even at its inflated
price tag is competitive against the
similarly priced 2600 X whether stock or
overclocked however again the Rison 5
2600 is the standout value option
beating every other CPU by a large
margin three months ago it was a
completely different story Intel's
lineup was much better value for gaming
particularly the Core i5
8400 but even the 8700 K was a standout
by up against a mb's 8 core offerings
Ami's aggressive price cuts have
definitely evened up that race of course
it's also important to note here that
this gaming value discussion only
applies in CPU limited scenarios like
1080p with a flagship GPU anyone playing
at a higher resolution or with a slower
GPU will see the value of intel's faster
gaming cpu shrink and AMD retake a
strong lead certainly if your GPU
limited there's no reason to buy an 8700
K over the excellent value
Rison 5 2600 just for gaming so looking
across the lineup of CPUs you can
currently buy it's not a great time to
purchase an Intel CPU especially with
AMD's aggressive price drops for their
rice and line up there isin five 2600 is
the best value CPU on the market right
now by a fair margin though those that
need something faster should also
consider the Rison 7 2700 whether you're
gaming or running productivity apps
budget shoppers should be looking at the
horizon 320 200 G or the Athlon 200 GE
if you can find one in stock for a
reasonable price
I haven't even fair
in platform costs if two things such as
a motherboard cooler or memory which
often swings things even more into
Andy's favor for example you can
comfortably overclock the Verizon 5 2600
on a budget p450 motherboard
whereas Core i5 80 600 K buyers will
have to fork out for a more expensive Z
370 board to access overclocking I think
this is also a good precursor for what's
to come with 9th gen Lee Core i5 9600 K
Intel's new 6th core 6 third replacement
for the 80 600 K is $20 more than 8,600
K right now and the 8600 K is already
worse value than rising alternatives
then we have the 8 quart 9700 K going
for four hundred and ten dollars which
is more than the 8700 K so you have to
offer much higher performance to
position itself as a value contender and
then of course the 9900 K at five
hundred and thirty dollars was hard to
see how that competes with the three
hundred dollar rise in 720 700 X unless
again it's capable of monstrous
performance so yeah it's not looking
good for Intel at all they really don't
have a single win when it comes to value
right now and it'll take something crazy
with ninth gen to have that change it's
also bad news for consumers as AMD
really doesn't have any incentive to
further lower the cost of rice and
processes they are standout value
options right now so why make them
cheaper a more competitive Intel lineup
could have I guess forced further price
cuts are a nice price battle between the
two companies but we're just not going
to get that right now that's it for this
