hardware box video hit subscribe then
tap the Bell welcome back to this
special edition of the hardware box news
corner it's the weekend here in
Australia so I'm gonna keep this one
relatively short in video today has
decided to pull the plug on their hugely
controversial GeForce Partner Program
gotta say I was pretty surprised to wake
up and read about this news so let's dig
into what Nvidia had to say in their
official statement the blog post written
by John T Paul starts by saying a lot
has been said recently about our GeForce
Partner Program the rumors conjecture
and mistruths go far beyond its intent
rather than battling misinformation
we've decided to cancel the program
Nvidia states of the GPP had a simple
goal ensuring that gamers know what they
are buying and can make a clear choice
and that the GPP was about making sure
gamers who want Nvidia tech get Nvidia
tech the statement continues with GPP we
asked our partners to brand their
products in a way that would be crystal
clear the choice of GPU greatly defines
a gaming platform so the GPU brand
should be clearly transparent no
substitute GPUs hidden behind a pile of
techno jargon still today we are pulling
the plug on GPP to avoid any distraction
from the super exciting work we're doing
to bring amazing advances to PC gaming
there's a few other sentences in the
statement but the general gist is pretty
simple nvidia cancelled the geforce
partner program because of the negative
public perception around the program in
pretty much any news story surrounding
Nvidia you could head to the comments
and find dozens of posters slamming
Nvidia on the GPP even their partners
like gigabyte masseuse and msi were
affected with seemingly unrelated
announcements being flooded with hate
comments relating to the GPP and to be
fair there was a lot of reason for that
hate as uncovered by Kyle Bennett at
heart OCP and covered here in videos
from several months ago the GeForce
partner program wasn't just ensuring
that gamers know what they're buying the
program appeared to be an active attempt
to control and videos
and squeeze competitors like AMD out of
partners most well-known gaming brands
leaving these brands exclusively for
g-force the consequences for not
agreeing to do this reportedly included
being denied marketing development funds
and other important things a partner
would need to remain competitive in the
graphics market one of my most
interesting and perhaps telling is that
Nvidia decided to cancel the jpp rather
than properly explain what the GPP was
all about
if nvidia didn't want to cop such flack
for the GPP and didn't want such rumors
conjecture and mistruths floating around
there were basically two things they
could have done one would have been to
explain how the GPP worked in an
official capacity putting to bed any of
the rumors and reports all while
providing much-needed clarity around the
agreement documents and invidious goals
with the program this probably would
have allowed the GPP to continue
existing which according to invidious
own explanations so far would have
benefited gamers everywhere the other
was to simply cancel the program
entirely without explaining anything and
that's the path they went down there are
quite clearly some aspects of the GPP
that NVIDIA doesn't want to explain or
clarify and if the hard OCP report on
the GBP is accurate that's probably for
a good reason
so they figured you know cancelling it
is an easier way out of course there are
potentially other factors at play too
wanting to end negative public
perception is one reason for a
cancellation but preventing any possible
litigation or antitrust investigations
could be another some of the alleged
terms in the GBP documents appeared to
be quite anti-competitive and we know
how the EU loves to hand out
billion-dollar fines for such
indiscretion so cancelling the program
could have prevented that sort of thing
in the end what was supposed to be a
program that invidious own words added
transparency and benefited gamers ended
up being one of the least transparent
moves the company has made recently and
didn't benefit gamers in any appreciable
way and this lack of transparency
refusal to discuss the GPP with the
media poor official explanations and
unwillingness to clarify supposed miss
Booth's still leaves us with many
questions even after this news of
cancellation what terms were actually
included in the GeForce Partner Program
documents how many partners agreed to
the original GPP terms and how many
declined does this program cancellation
actually avoid any and all sign GPP
contracts or doesn't just mean the
program isn't taking any new
participants is the GPP just going to be
replaced under a different name with
more secrecy surrounding it and video
almost certainly won't address these
questions publicly and I think there's
still a fair bit more to play out in
this story to get to the bottom of
everything but for now the gpause
partner program is no more and for many
that will be reason to celebrate
particularly AMD who wanted this program
investigated in the first place what
happens now is unclear in some
situations the damage of the GPP has
already been done a sues for example
launched a new ares brand for radeon
graphics cards last month replacing the
now geforce exclusive rog brand MSI
appeared to be starting a process of
removing Radeon cards from their top
tier gaming expand gigabyte as well
launched an RX 580 powered external GPU
without the Auris branding that was
found on equivalent nvidia products will
these companies reinstate Radeon
products to their main gaming brands or
continue with separate Radeon brands we
just don't know at this point in
wrapping this one up I'm honestly still
a bit surprised that this cancellation
happened I really thought Nvidia would
just go about their business and
continue to not talk about the GPP until
everyone had forgotten about it what do
