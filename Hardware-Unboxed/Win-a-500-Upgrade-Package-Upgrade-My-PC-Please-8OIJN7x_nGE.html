spot
readers for a big announcement I'm very
excited to inform you of a brand new
series we're finally able to launch
after months and months of planning the
idea for this new series came to me
after that huge rise in seven gaming PC
giveaway that we did earlier in the year
I really enjoyed the chance to give back
to you guys even if I could only muster
a single high-end PC which meant only
one person was ever going to win but
even so many of you took the time if
that me for running the competition and
we're really thankful just to have a
shot at winning such a glorious computer
this kind of feedback made me wish this
was something I could do more often I
tried to find a way to make that happen
tech spot was in a similar situation
with a big giveaway every now and then
but not something that was structured to
take place frequently I guess that's why
other channels and tech sites also
struggle to do these kind of giveaways
on a regular basis as I read through
your comments direct messages and emails
I became more and more motivated to try
and make the giveaways a regular thing
most of you are pushing for less extreme
giveaways and some even suggested
upgrade packages mostly inspired by the
fact that I have a ton of cool hardware
that you can see behind me and I could
potentially just give that away
sadly we need that gear to produce those
in depth benchmarks you often enjoy so
it's not really an option then it dawned
on me create a series where we give away
upgrade packages tailored to an
individual's computer and it was then
the name upgrade my PC please jumped
into my head for the past few months
I've been developing the series and now
we're finally ready to launch I say we
because upgrade my PC please is a
partnership between harbor unboxed and
techspot so first what is upgrade my PC
please well each week I'll be looking at
five pcs from viewers who are in need of
an upgrade I'll discuss their current
hardware configuration and propose the
upgrades I think we should make to
improve their system for the upgrades we
have allocated a budget of $500 us per
episode during the first season
the idea here is to help PC and through
so we're struggling to keep those
systems up to date and hopefully we can
do that in an entertaining and
educational fashion the five computers
will no doubt all differ at least to a
degree and therefore so too will the
upgrade options once I proposed the
upgrades it's then up to you the viewer
to decide which one of the five systems
deserves to win the upgrade package by
voting for the PC that you want to see
upgraded the most the winner will be
announced at the start of the following
episode and will purchase the hardware
from their local computer store and have
it delivered so they can carry out the
upgrades for this the first season of
upgrade my PC please we are only able to
cover a select few regions but we do
hope to expand the series as it develops
for season one people located in
Australia United States Canada and
United Kingdom can enter and this is a
very broad starting point in my opinion
join to your PC for consideration please
follow the link in the video description
it will take you to the text platforms
where you can register for a free
account and submit your entry your entry
will be private only the tech spot staff
which includes myself can review the
submission and you are free to make
changes or updates at any time
additionally we can also comment and
tell if there's something more we
require from you the submission process
is very straightforward and you'll be
asked all the appropriate questions
required to enter we will also require
at least three high quality photos of
the computer you wish to have upgraded
and the submission form will provide
more information about this obviously we
will also require basic contact details
such as your name address email and of
course those will all be kept private
when discussing your PC we will only use
your first name and/or user name slash
the nickname you use for your profile in
addition we will want a full rundown of
the hardware in your PC a full
specifications list details about when
and who built it along with what you use
the computer for and what you would like
to achieve with the upgrade so please
get your submissions in now as we will
be kicking off episode one next week and
I'll be featuring five of the best
submissions that we've received so far
one of those systems will become the FIR
winner by being voted the most eligible
to receive the proposed upgrade package
your submission will be valid for the
entire season and you can log on to the
tech spot forums and make changes at any
point the first season of upgrade my PC
please will comprise of ten episodes so
make sure you provide the best quality
photos you can and don't skimp on the
details make the most compelling case
for an upgrade by detailing your PC's
history and purpose this will definitely
help you get picked for this first
season only the PC that receives the
most user votes will win the upgrade
package but the hope is by next season

pcs featured on the episode that's
something we'll be working on as we
develop the series the first episode
