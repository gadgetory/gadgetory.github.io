are taking the Radeon rx 580 along with
the geforce gtx 1066 gigabyte and we're
benchmarking them in a shipload of games
to see which one is faster in 2019 we
first did this back in 2017 when we
tested 27 games and we found the RX 580
to be 3% faster on average at 1080p then
the following year 2018 we retested with
another 27 games half of well half a
dozen of which when you not necessarily
half of them but anyway half a dozen
when you and yeah the gtx 1066 gear bike
came out 1% faster on average it was
actually three percent faster
technically that if you include frost
Punk which was a massive outlier anyway
as I said earlier it's 2019 now and I'm
still not really sure why I'm reminding
you guys of the current year assume you
know what year it is so I'll just move
along
so you're 12 months has passed since we
made this comparison so naturally we
have another 27 game benchmark actually
you know what I was kind of thinking I
was pretty lazy in 2017 I kind of just
let that carry over into 2018
I mean 27 games honestly what was I
doing with all my free time so this year
I've pulled my finger out I've got
serious about this comparison and not
only am i testing at two resolutions at
1080p and 1440p so two resolutions this
year but I'm also testing with 38 games
I know what you're thinking there is no
way this video is going to generate
enough views to pay for that kind of
investment and you'd be right which is
why you're gonna sit there and enjoy
today's sponsor spot roll the tape play
the pre-roll ad forget everything you
can you know about mobile games because
one of the most ambitious RGB projects
of 2019 has just been released and it's
going to change everything
raid Shadow Legends is the most
immersive experience you'll find on a
smartphone and the best part is it's
totally free raid has all the features
expect from a brand new RPG title and
amazing storyline awesome 3d graphics
giant boss fights PvP battles and
hundreds of champions to collect
customize I have to say I never expected
to get this level of performance out of
a mobile game just look at how crazy the
level of detail is on these champions
raid special launch tournament is
happening right now so downloaded via
the link in the video description to get
50,000 silver and be automatically
entered into the tournament they can
compete for physical prize packs and
winners get the goods delivered straight
to their door so download today using
the link in the video description ok
let's get into it we're about to go over
the results for a dozen of the newer or
more popular titles and then we'll check
out some head-to-head comparisons with
all 38 games and a few quick performance
breakdown graphs for detailed
information regarding the performance of
the other 26 games that we won't analyze
please check out our patreon page for
those graphs because they will be made
available for free over there now as
usual our corsair GPU test rig built
inside the crystal series 570 X has been
used and inside we have a core I 9 9
snark a clocked at 5 gigahertz with 32
gigabytes of ddr4 30 or 400 memory
representing the green team is the
gigabyte Oris gtx 1066 you bite and for
the red team the year by taurus RX 508
extr 8 gigabyte the latest available
display drivers at the time of testing
have been used and all results have been
updated with the latest drivers I think
that's about everything let's get to the
good stuff well would you look at that
we're kicking things off with a brand
new game rage 2 for those of you unaware
rage 2 uses the Avalanche Studios apex
game engine in favor of EdTech but it
still uses the Vulkan API exclusively
this is good news for AMD as it allows
the game to make full use of the radiant
rx 5 ad as a result it was 13% fast in
the geforce gtx 1060 at 1080p moving on
in video recently addressed their poor
World War Z performance when using the
Vulkan API
so now GeForce GPUs deliver the same
level of performance regardless of the
API used unfortunately though this does
do a little to help the GeForce GTX
10:16 its battle with the Radeon rx 580
as here the AMD GPU was 31% faster at
1080p moving on the radio Erik's 580
also gets the better of the GeForce GPU
an apex legends here are 6 percent
faster at 1080p and 9% faster at 1440p
the 1% low performance was also quite a
bit stronger 11
better at 1080p and 13% at 1440p so
overall the RX 580 is the better choice
for apex fans then of course we have to
include the division 2 and this is
another comfortable win for the radio
and GPU that said at 1080p while it was
17% faster on average the one percent
low performance was rather comparable
still this is a strong tile for AMD and
a clear win for the RX 580 frame time
performance which we convert to a 1% low
metric is similar and shut off the Tomb
Raider using either GPU however it's the
RX 5 value that offers 14% more frames
an average 1080p and 21% more at 1440p
now no surprises here Assassin's Creed
Odyssey might be a name be sponsored
title but invidious DNA was embedded in
this series well before the red team
started throwing money at the developer
try as they might no amount of driver
optimization it will set this one
straight here the gtx 1066 gigabyte was
still 19% faster at IEP and 14% faster
at 1440p so pretty easy win here for in
video now despite using DirectX 11
Resident Evil 2 heavily favors the RX
580 quite shockingly it was 26% faster
than the GTX 1060 at both tester
resolutions this also means that the 580
is a viable option at 1440p whereas the
1060 was really less than ideal I know
it doesn't really look like it but AMD
has made a decent step forward in
fortnight over the past few months but
despite some driver improvements the
GeForce GTX 1060 is still 20% faster at
turn DP that margin is reduced to 15
percent at 1440p but still this is very
clearly a win for the green team despite
being an envious sponsored title the RX
580 is faster than the GTX 1060 and
metro Exodus there are only by a slim
margin at 1440p that said it was also
just 6 percent faster on average at
1080p but 16 percent faster when looking
at the one percent low performance
Rainbow six siege has always played
better with the RX 580 so nothing has
really changed here the radeon GPU
offered around 15% more performance and
again that difference is really
noticeable for those who are playing at
1440p
then we say that the radeon GPU is the
clear winner in our battlefield 5
benchmark beating the gtx 1060 by a 13
percent margin at 1080p the margin for
the 1% low result is much smaller but
overall the RX 580 was the superior GPU
in this test
unlike Assassin's Creed Odyssey Far Cry
New Dawn is an AMD sponsored title where
the rx 580 doesn't get trounced in fact
here the rx 580 is the one doing the
trouncing beating the GTX 1060 by an 8
percent margin at 1080p while delivering
considerably better 1% low performance
ok so that's how they can pair in a
dozen of the newer or more popular tiles
that we test with but now it's time to
see how they compare head-to-head with
the other 26 games I also test it with
included as well we've seen a bit of
back and forth between the RX 580 and
gtx 1060 over the years and well that
looks to continue here in last year's
test the 1060 was an average 3% faster
but in 2019 it's now 2 percent slower
that said we do deem anything under a 5
percent margin to be a tie so as I said
back in 2017 there's really no wrong
option here then for those of you gaming
at 1440p the RX 580 is a slightly better
option again and despite a big loss in
ace combat 7 it was overall the more
consistent performer the 1060 was slower
by a 5% margin or greater and 14 of the
games tested while it was only faster by
a 5% margin or greater in seven of the
games tested so once again it really
depends on the games you play to
determine which one is the best choice
for you and last I made this comparison
I pretty much concluded by saying there
was no right or wrong choice it's really
simply too close to call so get
whichever one is cheapest and I think
that's still the way to go today that
said the gtx 1060 is now an outgoing
product as it's been replaced by the gtx
1660 and while the 1662 i forgot a bit
more cash to spend so paying even $200
for a 6 gigabyte gtx 1060 is no longer
advisable given that the 1660 cost just
10% more and on average it's around 15%
faster and it's a little more fuel
efficient on the other hand the RX 588
gigabyte is selling for as little as
$180 so
at that price it is certainly worth
considering but anything about $190 us
and I'd say you're better off with the
GTX 1660 and that is going to do it for
this one if you enjoyed the video please
