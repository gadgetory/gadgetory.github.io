unboxed over the past few weeks I've
been looking into and exploring the
world of free sync - now this isn't a
new technology with first announced at
CES 2017 but it's only now that we're
starting to see the free sync to
ecosystem expand with new display
options as HDR and wide gamut monitors
become more of a reality over the next
year there's no better time to discuss
routing to than now
and from what I've been reading online
there's a fair bit of confusion around
what free sync to really is how it
functions and how it differs from the
original iteration of free sync this
video will explore and explain racing -
as the technology currently stands and
it's a little different to the tech AMD
announced more than a year ago while a
detailed video coming in the next week
we'll go through my impressions of using
a free sync to monitor here's a quick
refresher on the original free sync the
name free sync is just a brand name that
refers to AMD's implementation of
adaptive synchronization technology this
Tec essentially allows the display to
vary it's a refresh rate to match the
rendering of a graphics processor so
that for example a game running at 54
FPS is displayed at 54 Hertz and win
that game bumps up to 63 FPS the display
also shifts to 63 Hertz this
synchronization reduces stuttering and
screen tearing compared to a monitor
operating in a fixed refresh rate say 60
Hertz displaying a game running at an
unmatched render ate like 50 for FPS
free sync requires a few modifications
to the displays internal controls and
also a compatible graphics processor to
function invidious competing technology
that achieved similar results g-sync
uses an expensive proprietary controller
module free sync is an open standard in
fact it was adopted as the official visa
adaptive sync standard so any display
controller manufacturer can implement
the technology the core technology of
free sync is just this one feature
adaptive sync display manufacturers able
to integrate freesync in to their
display through whatever means they like
provided it passes adaptive sync
validation on
certified as freezing compatible only
means that monitor supports adaptive
sync there's no extra validation for
screen quality or other features so just
because a monitor has a free sync logo
on the box doesn't necessarily mean it's
a high quality product and this is where
free sync two comes in it's not a
replacement to the original free sync
and it's not really a direct successor
so the name free sync to is a bit
misleading what it does provide though
are additional features on top of the
original free sync feature set every
free sync to monitor is validated to
have these additional features so the
idea is that a customer shopping for a
gaming monitor can buy one with a free
sync to badge knowing it's of a higher
quality than standard free sync monitors
both free sync and free sync to will
coexist in the market while the naming
scheme doesn't suggest it freezing to is
effectively AMD's brand for premium
monitors validated to a higher standard
while free sync is more of a mainstream
option you're not getting old technology
by purchasing a monitor with original
free sync tech in fact the way adaptive
sync works in free sync and free sync to
is identical instead free sync monitors
simply miss out on the more premium
features offered through free sync tune
so what are these features well it
breaks down into three main areas high
dynamic range low framerate compensation
and low latency let's tackle HDR support
first when AMD originally announced true
sync - that went into detail on how
their implementation of resync 2 was
going to differ from a standard HDR
pipeline freezing twos HDR tone mapping
was supposed to use calibration and
specification data sent from the monitor
to the PC to simplify the tone mapping
process the idea was the games
themselves would tone map directly to
what the display was capable of
presenting with a free sync to transport
passing the data straight to the monitor
without the need for further processing
on the monitor itself this was in
contrast to standard hgr tone mapping
pipelines the C games tone map - an
intermediary format before the display
then figures out how to turn that to its
capabilities having the games do the
bulk of the HDR tone mapping work we're
supposed to reduce latency which is an
issue with HDR Gami at the moment that's
our AMD detailed free sync to HDR
implementation back at CES 2016
and teen well it sounded nice in theory
one of the key issues raised at the time
was that games themselves had to tone
maps specifically to freezing to
displace this meant games would have
needed to integrate a free sync to API
if this HJ implementation was ever to
succeed and we all know how difficult it
is to convince a game developer to
integrate a niche technology as free
sync to stands right now that original
HDR implementation isn't quite ready yet
Ami's websites freaking freezing to
simply list the technology as including
support for displaying HDR content and
there is no mention anywhere of free
sync to supported games and when you
actually use a free sync to monitor HDR
support rise entirely on Windows 10 HDR
implementation for now which is
improving slowly but isn't at the same
level AMD's original solution is set to
provide in an ideal environment the
reason for this is free sync to support
was only introduced in AMD's GPU
services 5.1.1 in September 2017 so game
developers have only had the tools to
implement free sync to sgp you side tone
mapping for a bit over seven months now
getting these sorts of technologies
implemented in games can take a long
time and right now there's no word on
whether any currently released games
have used a gs5 1.1 in the development
process one of the features AMD
mentioned as part of their HDR
implementation was automatic switching
between HDR and SDR modes so you could
game using the full HD are capabilities
of your display while returning to a
comfortable SDR for desktop apps
unfortunately this too doesn't seem to
be functional right now instead freezing
to once again makes use of Windows
standard HD implementation that doesn't
handle the HDR 2 SDR transition too well
however while the implementation might
not be anything special at the moment
freesync 2 does guarantee several things
relating to HDR all loosing two monitors
support HDR you're guaranteed to get an
HDR capable monitor if it has a free
sync to badge freezing 2 also ensures
you can run both adaptive sync and HDR
at the same time for an optimal gaming
experience and finally AMD states that
all three sync two monitors require
twice the perceptual color space of srgb
for better brightness and contrast it's
unclear exactly what AMD may
by twice the perceptual colorspace but
the idea is a free sink to monitor would
support a larger than srgb gama and
higher brightness than a basic gaming
monitor and it does appear that ambhi's
fruiting to validation process is
looking for more than just a basic
HJ implemented so far every free sync to
monitor that's available has been
announced meets at least the industry
standard display HDR 400 specification
this is a fairly weak HDR spec but I
have seen some non free sync -
supposedly HDR capable monitors failed
to even meet the display HDR 400 spec so
at least with free Singh - you're
getting a display that meets the new
minimum industry standard for monitor
HDR of course some monitors will exceed
display HDR 400 like the original set of
Samsung freesync 2 monitors such as the
CH 370 and CH 390 both of these displays
meet the display h gr 600 spec ideally
I'd have liked to see free sync to
stipulate and display HDR 600 minimum
but for hundreds of peak brightness from
display HDR 400 should be fine for an
entry level HDR experience the second
main free sync to feature is reduced
input latency which I briefly touched on
earlier HDR processing pipelines have
historically introduced a lot of input
lag particularly on the display side
however freesync 2 stipulates low
latency processing for both SDR and HDR
content AMD hasn't published a specific
metric that they are targeting for input
latency
however it's safe to say fifty to a
hundred milliseconds of lag like you
might get with the standard HD ITV would
not be acceptable for a gaming monitor
how freezing to is achieving low latency
support in 2018 appears to be more on
the display side than the original
implementation announced at the start of
2017 as I mentioned when discussing
precinct to use HDR implementation the
original idea was to push all tone
mapping into the game engine to cut down
on display side tone mapping thereby
reducing input latency as a displays
slow processor wouldn't need to get
involved as much as games haven't
started supporting free sync - yet today
it seems this latency reduction is
purely coming from better processing
hardware in the display for example
current Samsung crusing two monitors
include a low latency mode which is
automatically enabled when facing to is
enabled
the final key feature is low framerate
compensation this is a feature that goes
hand-in-hand with adaptive sync ensuring
adaptive sync functions at every frame
rate from zero fps up to the maximum
refresh rate supported by the display
there is one simple reason why we need
low framerate compensation displays can
only vary their refresh rate within a
certain window for example 48 to 144
Hertz if you wanted to run a game below
the minimum supported refresh rate say
it 40 FPS when the minimum refresh rate
is 48 Hertz normally you'd be stuck with
standard screen tearing or stuttering
issues like you get with a fixed refresh
monitor that's because the GPUs
rendering is out of sync with the
displays refresh rate lower frame rate
compensation or LFC extends the window
in which you can sync the render rate to
the refresh rate using adaptive sync
when the frame rate falls below the
minimum refresh rate of the monitor
frames has simply displayed multiple
times and the display runs at a multiple
of the required refresh rate in my
previous example to display 40 fps using
LFC every frame is doubled and then this
output is synced to the display running
at 80 Hertz you can even run games at
say 13 fps and have that sync - a
refresh rate in this case the monitor
would run at 52 Hertz to exceed the 48
Hertz minimum and then every frame would
be displayed four times the end result
is LFC effectively removes the minimum
refresh rate or adaptive sync displays
but for NFC to be supported the
modernise have a maximum refresh rate
there's at least double the minimum
refresh rate this is one not all free
sync monitors support LFC some come with
just 48 to 75 Hertz refresh windows
which doesn't meet the criteria for LHC
however in the case of free sync to
every monitor validated for this spec
will support LFC so you won't have to
worry about the minimum refresh rate of
the monitor this wouldn't be a look at
free sync - in 2018 without exploring
what free sync 2 monitors are actually
available right now and what monitors
are coming up currently there are only 3
free sync 2 monitors on the market and
all from Samsung's quantum dot lineup
the C 27 HD 70 and C 32 HD 70 as 27 and
32 inch 1440p
forty-four hurt someone whose
respectively along with this stupidly
wide c49 HG 90 a double 1080p 144 Hertz
monitor all three are display HDR 600
certified set for release this year are
several other options we have the Ben QE
X 3203 are a 32 inch curved VA panel
with a 144 Hertz refresh rate and 1440p
resolution certified for display HDR 400
the AOC agon AG 322 QC 4 is another free
sync to monitor and it appears to use
the same panel has the BenQ monitor we
were just talking about so it has the
same specifications then there's the
Philips 436 m6 v BPA be seriously hunain
tap monitor which is a 43 inch 4k 60
Hertz display sporting display HDR 1000
certification yep that's right 1000 nits
of peak brightness in this panel the
last thing I mentioned here is GPU
support freezing to requires an AMD
graphics card as you might expect of an
AMD technology and according to this
list everything from a Murray's rx 200
series or newer with the exception of a
few products is supported there's also a
bunch of ap use with integrated graphics
that will work as well if you have an
NVIDIA GPU freesync 2 monitors will
still work and you will get most of the
benefits including support for HDR what
you won't get is adaptive sync support
so if you want that you'll need to find
a monitor with invidious equivalent
g-sync HDR technology that's it for this
exploration of free sync - I hope you
all learn something and now have all the
information you need for this upcoming
next wave of gaming monoliths consider

continue to improve our display testing
and I'll catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
