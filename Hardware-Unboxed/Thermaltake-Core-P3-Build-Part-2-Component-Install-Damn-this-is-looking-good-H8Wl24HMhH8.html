Thermaltake Corp III in partnership with
Thermaltake I'm giving away three of
these beautiful awesome cases to enter
sign up at our former hardware in box
comm post a picture of your current rig
your specs and quickly tell me what you
want to do with the core p3 good luck
and enjoy the video hopefully by now you
watch part 1 of my thermaltake core p3
build series where I show all the
amazing hardware I have on hand which
should be a truly epic build if you
haven't go and check out that first by
clicking the link here right then so
you've watched part 1 good let's not
waste any more time and get on with the
build rather than talk you through
everything here's a nice little tune if
you to bop along too well I put it all
together enjoy
you
you
you
you
so not to glow but damn that looks
pretty good way better than anything I
built myself before of course I only
pulled off the easy part of the build
next up I'll need to stop bending some
hard tubes so it'll be interesting to
see how that goes still for now I'm
super chuffed with how the builds are
progressing none of this is really done
to me though I really have to credit
thermaltake Azrael Kingston and gee
skill is there awesome looking hardware
that makes this build so impressive I
hope you guys are as impressed with the
build as I am and if you are stick
