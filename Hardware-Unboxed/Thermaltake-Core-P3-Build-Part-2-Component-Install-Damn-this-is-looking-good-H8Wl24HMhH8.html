should be a truly epic build if you

clicking the link here right then so
you've watched part 1 good let's not
waste any more time and get on with the
build rather than talk you through
everything here's a nice little tune if
you to bop along too well I put it all
together enjoy
you

so not to glow but damn that looks
pretty good way better than anything I
built myself before of course I only
pulled off the easy part of the build
next up I'll need to stop bending some
hard tubes so it'll be interesting to
see how that goes still for now I'm
super chuffed with how the builds are
progressing none of this is really done
to me though I really have to credit
thermaltake Azrael Kingston and gee
skill is there awesome looking hardware
that makes this build so impressive I
hope you guys are as impressed with the
build as I am and if you are stick
