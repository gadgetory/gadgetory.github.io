box today we're talking about games
specifically the best games released on
PC this year even though it's been a
great year for releases on console with
titles like horizon zero dawn and Zelda
breath of the wild capturing everyone's
attention and topping plenty of those
Game of the Year lists there's still
been a number of excellent games hit the
PC for this list we've compiled 5 great
PC games released this year and we'll be
talking about them in no particular
order the games we chose a mix of what
we played and like this year along with
what you guys nominated for the best
game when we asked and there's no better
way to kick this list off than one of
the biggest games not just of the year
but of all times in terms of sales
the overwhelming viewer choice for best
game when polled on Twitter was player
unknown some battlegrounds and it's not
hard to see why pub G is a fun addictive
Battle Royale game taking the world by
storm until the last few weeks it was
only available on PC so far more than 24
million copies have been sold and the
game is the most concurrently played on
Steam just 9 months after it first hit
early access yes there is a bit of
roughness in its presentation and there
are plenty of technical issues players
deal with on a regular basis we've
benchmark the game a few times and even
with version 1.0 it's optimization
leaves a bit to be desired on PC but
that doesn't stop the game from being a
fun and a heart-pounding challenge
whether you're playing solo or in a team
it's actually pretty hard to describe
what exactly mechanics make pub G of
blast but the combination of
last-man-standing hundred player battles
with scavenging for weapons and a
shrinking of play area just has some
magic qualities and there are no
microtransactions impacting gameplay
something that is surprisingly rare in
2017 prey is the next game in this list
and it is underrated and unfortunately
didn't seem that popular commercially
but it's one of my personal favorites
and also turn up
many of your lists the best aspect to
pray isn't its combat or its course
story which could have done with an
extra bit of Polish instead it's the
exploration that makes this game so
successful there are ton of things to
see and discover around the tell us one
and while everything takes place inside
this over on space station each area you
unlock contains varied environments and
new challenges
it keeps the game fresh and mostly
prevents derivative encounters the
stealth aspects to pray also worked well
especially the lack of weapon ammunition
that leaves you scrambling for crafting
components or crave solutions to defeat
enemies in fact pray encourages
creativity and a number of the weapons
and alien abilities you can obtain allow
you to execute brilliant and inventive
strategies pray is definitely worth
exploring and now that it's often
available on sale there's not much to
lose only actual Nazis don't love a game
about shooting Nazis and Wolfenstein 2
the new Colossus is definitely a game
about shooting Nazis in fact shooting
Nazis basically all you do in this game
and it's immensely satisfying developer
machine games has managed to craft a
game that makes a ridiculously
overpowered character like BJ blaster is
fun throughout its entirety especially
as the story twists from one ludicrous
encounter to another Wolfenstein 2 like
previous games in the series also
includes a decent story better than most
single-player first-person shooters and
that could be because there's no
multiplayer modes to speak of the story
certainly isn't some throwaway junk just
to fuel the violence which is exactly
what you want to see from this sort of
game it also runs very well on PC and
looks beautiful thanks to the Intex 6
engine and Vulcan support one
role-playing game stands out from the
crowd in 2017 and that's the PC
exclusive divinity original sin - it's
not a game we've played a ton but it's
one that many of you said we must
include in our best games list and
there's plenty of reasons for that
divinity original sin - is a complex and
incredibly deep RPG with the true
role-playing focus
I'm going to develop a character and
mold the story to your liking you want
to set aside at least 50 hours to
complete this game - if not 100 hours
because there's so much stuff to do
quests galore plenty of NPCs to interact
with and loads of explorable areas the
combat is technical and rewards
expertise with all the game systems as
well which is a testament to the quality
of the overall package the game is being
lauded as one of the best RPGs of all
time so if you're an RPG fan and hasn't
played it definitely chuck it in your
backlog near automata is another game
that comes highly recommended by you
guys and it's one of the most unusual
releases of the year it's a third-person
open-world role-playing game but in some
environments and sections it transforms
into different perspectives and switches
to different gameplay mechanics like
platforming these elements mix well
together in contrast to its mediocre
predecessor while combat is strong and
satisfying as with all good RPGs Nier
automata includes an engrossing story
that covers a variety of themes you even
have to play the game multiple times to
reveal the true endings that each
playthrough is slightly different and
surprisingly satisfying to complete
unfortunately the PC port of the game
was rather poor issues like you know
that 30 FPS locking cutscenes
annoying some people and there's been a
few various crashes although community
patches have now resolved most of the
pressing issues port issues aside though
neo tammana is worth exploring
especially if you want something a
little different from the norm there
were plenty of other games that were on
the short list that are worth I
mentioned - note just some honorable
mentions including the excellent and
challenging cuphead the artistically
brilliant hell blades send you a
sacrifice indie hit what remains of
Edith Finch some great racing games came
out this year like dirt 4 and project
cars - and even Assassin's Creed origins
was great which was a visually stunning
game and a return to form for the series
did we miss again that you thought
should have made the cut I'm sure you'll
let us know in the comments below also
let's know what games you think were the
most disappointing of 2017 because we'll
be tackling those in another video very
shortly so I guess I'll definitely be
catching you next to him</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
