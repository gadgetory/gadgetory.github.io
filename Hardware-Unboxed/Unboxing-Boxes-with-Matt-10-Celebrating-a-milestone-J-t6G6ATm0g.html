unboxed yeah
that's right this is episode 10 of
unboxing boxes with Matt and I just like
to thank you all so much for getting
this great show to where it is now and I
hope this can be an extra-special
episode and maybe we can even get to 100
likes
who knows fingers crossed here anyway
let's get stuck into it
who's this from now they're from Hong
Kong anyway fricasseed for oh I know
so I've got this slight fascination with
Chinese phones at the moment and this
one here is a Cuba but I've never heard
of before
let's pop over in the box and take a
look
some pretty fancy shiny blocks today
massive phones so I believe from memory
it's got a six inch screen which is
bigger than anything I've had before
comes a little cover which is nice so
probably back up
all right so that is the Cuba I don't
know cubot max the cubot max that is the
name of this phone and obviously cold
max was so damn big trying to turn it on
now it's pretty much all right not sure
if it's an HD screen well that's not
obvious if it is but anyway we'll save
that for the review but uh that feels
pretty decent best fits of my squares on
it it's an Android phone
looks like Android seeks I'll be doing
quick review on this so keep your eyes
peeled for that one all right
next up I know exactly what's in here
from SteelSeries so let me show you guys
what it is
those of you to pay attention might know
a bit of a rocket League fan not a good
player but I do like to play and I
thought why not try and find the
ultimate controller for rocket League so
I reach at the SteelSeries and they've
sent over their Stratis Excel which is
looks remarkably similar to an Xbox one
controller which I like so I'll give you
guys a quick clue have it pretty nice
looking it really is just about the
exact same shape as the Xbox one
controller the triggers feel the same it
might be a bit less clicky yeah it feels
good so um yeah I'm gonna go play some
rough leg Oh two more do you want
packages then I can play damn what's
next
other than this
m2 SSD from Intel 512 gigabyte model I
haven't heard the best things about
these so I'll be interested to check it
out myself he's popping open break the
little factory seal and have a look a
good thing about this little guys it is
an nvme drive and the cost per gigabyte
is pretty exceptional so anyway I'll be
checking this out soon alright last but
not least I've been dying to bust this
open and I had to save it for today's
episode
and the reason I've been dying to bust
it open is because it's the first thing
to come in my peer box which means I
think one of you guys have sent it to me
unless one of my friends has done as a
prank oh please don't anthrax or a
little bomb ha ha there's a message
inside says dear Matt I thought this
would look nice on your wall behind you
I just finally upgraded love macula ha
ha no way someone sent me a graphics
card one of its dead
what is this a sushi republic of gamers
card so looks like it is a 9800 GT Wow
I'm definitely gonna plug this in and
see if it works

awesome thanks you for sending that over
my feuless it's definitely the girl from
the wall behind me and if anyone else
has any alive or dead stuff they want to
send over to stick behind me get on to

to show you guys today one of the guys

photos of his build so far so I'm just
gonna pop them open on my phone but
we'll have it up on the screen for you
