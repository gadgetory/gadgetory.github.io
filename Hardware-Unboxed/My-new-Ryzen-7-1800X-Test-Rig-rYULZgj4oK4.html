now you may have noticed that Rison has
landed I really can't say that with a
straight face of course you guys know
Verizon is here but anyway the
productivity performance as you probably
know is stellar
it's really better than I was expecting
it's first-rate the gaming performance
is also very solid there's been some
controversy but frank'll 16 thread
processor it certainly does enough
though we do expect rise and 5 to tackle
gaming more head-on anyway this video
has nothing to do with the rising
controversy nothing about rising gamer
performance so no benchmarks nothing
like that it's just a fun video and
hopefully everyone can relax in the
comments section and enjoy it so yeah it
is a Rison system build when I was
reviewing horizon I was meant to put
this together a bit of a teaser to show
you show off my rise and test system why
I would be using to bring you guys the
review but there was a few issues and in
the end I didn't have time to get the
video out so now it's probably what's
almost two weeks late now ok better late
than never so what I will be showing you
is the main horizon rig that I will be
using for benchmarking with the 1800 X
so it should be a pretty cool system and
since I did build most of it a few weeks
ago and I've got a couple of new cool
bits in since then I have made a few
upgrades to the rig which you will see
in the video so a bit of a spoiler this
rig is very cool I love it dearly I'm
very very proud of it it's been a long
time since I could say I was proud of
one of my AMD test systems but this
thing is the real deal very cool system
so I'm keen to show it off to you guys
so anyway with that let's get to the
build and then I'll discuss the diffused
afterwards
well what can I say really that's almost
too good-looking for a test system it's
a bit of a shame I won't have a glass
panel on the whole time and I'll be
ripping graphics cards in and out the
cable management isn't quite as good as
it could be because I will be ripping
things in and out constantly but yeah
probably the best-looking testers - may
have yet the cable ache system that
Corsair sponsored was also very very
impressive looking but I think this one
takes the cake
I really like it and I think this would
be possibly the tenth power unbox test
system now I'll have to do a head count
after this video be ever-growing family
of test systems here at harbor unboxed
and I think this is my favorite of them
all as cool as Joule Titan XP cards are
sli those green glowing geforce logos on
the side kind of spoil the aesthetics so
I think the MSI gaming X graphics cards
look more at home in this system for
those of you wondering I have used the
asrock fatality X 370 gaming k4
motherboard which currently sells for
150 u.s. or 220 ozzie then we have
courses Vengeance LP X 16 gigabytes ddr4
3000 memory kit which sells for 130 u.s.
or 160 Aussie I swapped out that knocked
to a 120 millimeter a m4 style cooler
which you would have seen earlier in the
video that sells for 65 u.s. or 90
Australian and I replaced it with the
beefy ek xlc predator 240 I'm not
actually sure how much the predator
costs I couldn't find it on sale at
Amazon or Newegg and I did strip off the
fans and the controller and a few other
bits and pieces off it so that kind of
defeated the purpose of playing it not
that I did it was supplied but anyway
it's an all-in-one solution and with the
fans on it and the controller it's a
very neat bit of kit the reason I pulled
off the fans and all that was because I
wanted to use the corsair RGB fans and
fit it into the case a bit better which
I think I achieved it looks really nice
and it fit like a glove also most
importantly it does a great job of
keeping the rise in 7 1800 X cool even
when overclocked overall this is going
to be a great test
to benchmark with I think you guys will
agree and speaking of which I'm very
keen to get this video edited upload it
and do some benchmarking with this
system so I had a lot of fun putting the
system together so much fun that I was
almost disappointed when I was done I
wanted to keep tinkering and build
another riser system which is actually
good news because I'll be doing exactly
that probably starting next week
presuming all the bits come in but I
have the beginnings of what is going to
be probably the coolest rising system
I'm going to build in a long time
and it will be the system that I'm
giving away to one lucky subscriber so
I've got this box just arrived this
morning from thermaltake and it's the
start of some of the bits we need to
build that system I'll go through it all
in a video shortly once I have all the
other bits so yeah this is going to be a
really really cool system I can't wait
to get stuck into it'll be a custom
liquid-cooled hard pipe system so yeah
it's going to be exciting and the best
bit is I get to give it away and it will
be a global competition so any one of
you guys watching this video has the
chance to win a high end horizon system
with all the bells and whistles so with
that I'm going to wrap this video up I
hope you enjoyed watching me build this
beast and you'll be seeing some test
results from it shortly I'm your host
Steve catch again soon
