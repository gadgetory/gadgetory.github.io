video we're taking the tried and true
risin 5 1600 everyone's favorite
mid-range desktop processor and pairing
it against everyone's favorite mid-range
desktop processor the core i5 8400
see.they boss from us if you likely a
male between the age of 25 and 34 have
almost but not quite $200 u.s. to spend
on a CPU which one do you get rather
than spend countless hours benchmarking
an effort to terminal we know let's just
turn to Amazon and let you guys sort it
out for me
Rison five sixteen hundred four and a
half stars from almost four hundred
reviews very nice stuff there surely
that is gonna give it over the line
right the core i5 8400 four and a half
stars from almost 400 reviews hmm
alright fine we'll do this the hard way
okay so as usual before we get to those
glorious blue bar graphs there are a few
things worth mentioning the Rison v 1600
was released almost this time last year
on April 11th at 220 dollars us and with
six calls in 12 threads it was seriously
impressive given that price tag
last month though AMD did officially
reduce the pricing of their entire rise
in line up and this or the 1600 dropped
down to a hundred and ninety dollars us
the reason they've done this is because
shortly the second-generation Rison
processes will become available and many
shoppers are now well aware of this fact
so in an effort to drive sales of the
first gen parts the discount campaign
begun at this point though we recommend
you wait a few weeks before making any
cpu purchases and then reevaluate your
options so that being said why bother
with this comparison at all well for a
few reasons most notably of which is the
fact that these second generalising
parts are incoming by establishing how
AMD and Intel currently stack up with
the latest Windows updates BIOS updates
driver updates and new motherboards will
have an up-to-date reference point for
the new CPUs a big part of Verizon's
appeal is the value aspect you can throw
the rise in v 1600 on a relatively
inexpensive motherboard overclock the
snot out of it
and you're away meanwhile the core i5
8400 up until about a week ago it was
stuck on these ed 370 platform a
platform that for the most part it can't
utilize so the added price on the
motherboard hurts its value now though
we do have the h3 10 B 360 and H 370
boards and these helped us shave a
little bit off the top so this changes
the value aspect of the more affordable
coffee-like CPUs and makes them somewhat
more appealing to budget shoppers
therefore for this test we're going to
compare the arisin 5 1600 using ddr4 32
inner memory on the MSI be 350 M motor
in its out-of-the-box configuration as
well as a 4 gigahertz overclock using a
basic tower style air cooler then the
core i5 8400 has been tested on two
motherboards one of which is the
cheapest be 360 motherboard MSI makes
the B 360 m at pro-v D on this budget be
360 board we're using ddr4 2666 memory
and the Box cooler
additionally the core i5 process has
been tested on the MSI z3 70 PC Pro with
ddr4 3200 memory and a basic tower style
air cooler so I think that just about
covers all the bases oh and before
anyone asks no MCE
wasn't enabled in any of the core i5
8400 tests mostly because you can't
actually enable this feature on any of
the locked Intel CPUs regardless of
which 300 series motherboard using
alright so kick starting off the blue
bar graph parade is Sai soft sandra's
memory balance test and here we're
looking at the sustain to read write
performance in gigabytes per second
the core i5 8400 on the B 360
motherboard is limited to just under
twenty seven gigabytes per second as the
maximum memory support for this chipset
is ddr4 2666 however using a z3 70 board
with ddr4 3,200 memory that increased
the throughput by 22% and it resulted in
a bandwidth of thirty two point seven
gigabytes per second so pretty
impressive stuff but it did still place
it behind that Rison five 1600 which was
good for around 39 gigabytes per second
again with ddr4 3,200 memory and this is
with the rise in cebu both stock and
overclocked
before we get into the real world
applications here's a look at the
Cinebench r15
cause I know all you guys love a good
Cinebench score and as always please
note that these are not the absolute
best scores these scores are based on an
average of half a dozen back-to-back
runs as expected what this shows us is
that Intel enjoys greater single core
performance or risings many threads
thanks to the use of SMT gives it
superior multi-threaded performance
demonstrating the excellent
multi-threaded performance of the
horizon processor is the v-ray benchmark
rather than spitting out a school like
what Cinebench does what we're looking
at here is the render time measured in
seconds so lower is better here we sent
the stock risin 5 1600 was 16% faster
than the 8400 on the B 360 board and 13%
faster than the 8400 on the said 370
board overclocking the 1600 improve
performance by 16% and now the AMD CPU
is at least 31 percent faster than the
core i5 8400 when it comes to video
editing the superior IPC of the Core i5
processor and the often higher clock
speeds that are achieved when doing
these lightly threaded editing tasks
gives the Intel CPU an advantage Rison
isn't exactly slow in comparison but
it's not a slam-dunk case for AMD life
what we've seen in the previous tests
and we'll cover a bit more on editing
performance when we get to the premier
Pro results later in this video
moving right along to the physics
performance in games here we see that if
a game is well designed to take
advantage of risings many threads it
could allow the r5 1600 to dominate the
8400 even when left stock of course this
isn't the case in 99% of the games out
there
in fact even today ashes of the
singularity is one of the few examples
we have a well designed game that can
take advantage of many cores
before we get into the games though we
have a few more productivity benchmarks
to check out and here we can see how
these CPUs compare and Corona AMD's
Rison v 1600 enjoys a big win in this
benchmark completing a render time 27%
quicker than that of the core i5 8400
that margin grows to 30% once the
sixteen hundred's overclocked and the
8400 is thrown on a zed 370 board so a
great result here for AMD lower is
better for the blended test as we're
again measuring the time it takes to
complete the render
out-of-the-box the risin 5 1600 is
superior beating the 8,400 by 6% margin
even when it's using the higher speed
memory on these at 370 board
overclocking the Rison processor reduced
the render time by 13% making it clearly
superior in this test
moving on to handbrake here the core i5
8400 was faster than the r5 1600 albeit
by a small margin still we do see an 8
percent increase in performance when
going from 9.3 frames per second to 10
frames per second however once we
overclocked to 1600 performance is
boosted by 14% and this is enough to
edge out the 8400 even when it's paired
with higher frequency memory on a z2 370
board encoding one of our 4k videos like
the one you're watching right now
premier saw both processors deliver very
similar performance out of the box
feeding the core i5 8400 more bandwidth
reduced the encode time by 5% which
isn't bad but we saw a 16% reduction in
code time by overclocking Verizon this
meant best case scenario for the Intel
CPU still sees that 13% slower in this
test however when it comes to editing as
we noted earlier in this video when
looking at the PC mark results the
performance is a little more competitive
generally speaking these editing tasks
don't fully utilize the thread heavier
isin processes and we certainly see that
when using the warp stabiliser effect in
premiere still with performance on both
CPU is maximized we do get a very
similar result now if you love Excel
spreadsheets like Tim and myself then
risings go to impress the complex Monte
Carlo simulation completed 23% faster
with horizon though admittedly it's rare
that you'll do too many Excel jobs that
take either of these C views more than a
few seconds to complete then we have the
7-zip test in here these stock are 5
1600 was 15% faster than the 8400 when
carrying out compression work but a
massive 40% faster for decompression
pairing the 8400 with high-speed memory
only improves this performance in this
test by about 2% meanwhile overclocking
the horizon processor increased
performance by a further eight to 15%
giving it a significant advantage over
the core i5 8400 in this workload before
we move into the gaming benchmarks which
I'm sure many of you guys
have been hanging out to see here's a
quick look at power consumption the MSI
B 360 M Pro VD is very fuel efficient
and it allows total system consumption
of the core i5 8,400 system to drop
under 100 watts for this heavy workload
which is very impressive
moving to the MSI's III 70 PC Pro with
the fast ddr4 memory this did increase
power draw by 24 percent and it did only
reduce the render time by a mere 2%
meanwhile the risin 5 1600 did consume
quite a bit more power certainly was the
more power-hungry CP of the 2 but keep
in mind blender does utilize all 12
threads so a 65 percent jump from the
stock 8400 isn't that bad given it does
have 100 percent more threads when
compared to the zip 370 configuration
emerge and is significantly reduced as
well for this comparison the rise in CPU
was 32% more power-hungry so as I said
in my initial B 360 coverage these
stripped-down motherboards really helped
to improve the performance per watt of
the coffee-like CPUs overclocked the r5
1600 consumed a little over 70 percent
more power than the 8400 on these Z 370
motherboard and that sounds like a lot
and well it is however keep in mind this
is total system consumption all 12
threads are under heavy load so the fact
that the systems drawing just 200 watts
from the wall isn't exactly that extreme
now on to some games and as noted
earlier this is one of the few modern
tiles that does a good job of utilizing
the rise and cpus it's not often you'll
see results like these when looking at
gaming performance and as AMD's luck
would have it they just so happen to
kick some serious silicon in one of the
few games nobody really plays hence the
name ashes of the benchmark here we see
what's probably a more typical picture
when comparing the horizon and
coffee-like CPUs in games when we test
with assassin's creed origins it's not a
terrible picture but intel is up to 20
percent faster with a high end GPU at
1080p i'll discuss what this means later
in the video for now though let's check
out a few more games from day one
battlefield 1 is a game that's played
quite well with the rise in CPUs and we
see that still the case although still
slower than the core i5 8400 the margins
small enough to deem them insignificant
especially when looking at the
all-important 1% low results far cry 5
is also very playable with the horizon 5
1600 despite the core i5 8400 delivering
a superior performance overclock the r5
1600 does close the gap but it is still
7% slower than the 8400 on the B 360
board and that is for the 1% low result
and 12% slower for the average frame
rate I was expecting the Rison 5 1600 to
stack up a bit better and over watch I
have to say and while you can't say that
over 160 FPS at all times is bad I was
expecting the core i5 8400 to pull away
for the average frame rate rather than
the 1% low result in any case both
provided extremely smooth performance
with the GT X 1080 Ti
finally we have Warhammer vermintide 2
and this recently released total does a
good job of utilizing the horizon 5 1600
the horizon CPU was just 13% slower for
the 1% low result and 4% slower for the
average frame rate again both CPUs
provided highly playable performance
ok so we've had a pretty good look at
application and gaming performance as
expected Intel's faster in games for the
most part while AMD is faster for most
of the heavy workloads especially the
ones that we tested and that being a
situation this is how I look at it even
with a gtx 1080 TI adjust 1080p there's
really no telling which cpu you're using
when gaming both are exceptionally
smooth and able high frame rates
certainly high enough for your average
gamer when it comes to things like
extracting a compressed archive you're
absolutely going to notice a 60%
reduction in time there even blend away
the overclocked rise in 5 1600 shaved
off just 20% from the completion time
basically that means for a job that
takes the Intel CPU an hour in 6 minutes
you're looking at around 53 minutes with
the rise and CPU giving you a 30-minute
head start to move on to the next job
and over the course of a day that really
does add up of course the time saving
could be even larger than that we saw
rise and shave 30% off Intel's render
time and Corona naturally though it
could also be less than that we did see
just a 16% reduction with Premiere Pro
and then virtually nothing with
handbrake though that particular
breakeven situation appeared to be sort
of a worse
case scenario for AMD we also saw an
overclock Tizen only matched the warp
stabilization performance of the core i5
8400 and premiere still what this shows
is that for heavy workloads the Rison v
1600 is king and it's worth keeping in
mind this is something that everyone
will benefit from regardless of their
hardware configuration meanwhile to
enjoy the core i5 superior gaming
performance you really need an extreme
graphics card with the gtx 1070 or less
the difference won't really be seen on
the framerate counter of course there is
the little matter of which cpu will
offer the best experience in two or
three years time and while let's be
honest that's really anyone's guess
I wouldn't dare waste your time
speculating about such a thing
what I will do though is break down the
pricing and work out which platform
offers you the most bang for your buck
starting with memory prices the
difference between ddr4 2666 and ddr4
3200 really is negligible at this point
most of the time you're not really
paying a premium for the higher clock
stuff then B 360 and be 350 motherboards
of similar quality cost around the same
amount I'd expect to pay around $80 for
a quality board then with both CPUs
costing around the same amount buyers
are looking at spending around four
hundred and thirty dollars u.s. for
either combo of 16 gigabytes of ddr4
memory if you want to pair the core i5
8400 with a z3 70 board which I think I
would recommend doing at this point then
it's going to cost around $40 more
making Intel's platform about 9% more
expensive the reason I wouldn't bother
with the B 360 or H 370 boards in my
opinion anyway just comes down to our
lack of features and of course they
don't support overclocking although you
can't actually overclock the core i5
8400 honors ed 370 board it does give
you more options in the future if you
want to upgrade to an unlocked processor
and it'll also fetch a better price on
the second-hand market anyway if you
happen to disagree with me that's fine
and what it means is that the 8400 can
be snapped up with motherboard memory
for about the same price as the horizon
5 1600 on a be 350 board so pricing has
been somewhat neutralized
this leaves AMD and Intel a bit of a
stalemate to be honest they both have
this
strengths and weaknesses of course but
overall they are very evenly matched and
while you'll no doubt see a fair bit of
combat in the comment section below
let's be honest I really can't imagine
you'd be anything but impressed with
either solution that said you guys are
going to want to hear which one I would
peak and if I was forced to pick which I
suppose I would be if I was buying one
of them I'd probably still purchased the
Rison 560 100 for the simple fact that I
do spend more time working on my PC than
playing it's a sad fact but it's also
true I also like the idea that Amy's
promising future compatibility with new
rise and CPUs Intel the other hand will
likely ditch their current mainstream
platform after the next processor
release still as I said earlier no this
probably matters right now as I would
actually hold off and buy either a riser
or coffee like CPU till the second
generation horizon series arrives later
this month at which point you'll then
have access to what will probably be
slightly faster rising CPUs and then
existing rising cpus like the r5 1600
that we're talking about should become
even cheaper anyway what today's video
has shown us is that if AMD can indeed
find another 10% performance with these
second gen rise and CPUs then they're
going to be in great shape and that is
going to do it for this video I hope you
enjoyed the arisin five 1600 versus Core
i5 8400 comparison
it's an 8400 thanks for watching
I'm your host Dave I'll see you next
