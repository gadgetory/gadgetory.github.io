round how about that so we promised our
patreon members we would answer their
questions but we couldn't fit it all in
with all the other questions that we had
in part one - so bonus round is part
three these are all the questions that
were asked on our discord server so yeah
they deserve their own episodes that's
what you're getting let's get into it
first of our patreon questions here from
none other than Sal Kagan thought about
long-term members will be at home Z what
are your guys thoughts on the tech press
in general having a bias towards gaming
performance being the ultimate decider
about what makes the best CPU and using
that for their general recommendation as
opposed to any other kind of workload
yeah I mean I think any sort of you know
press site has sort of their different
things that they're looking out for I
think a lot of people you know they're
writing for a gaming audience people are
interested in in gaming and something
that's sort of our primary audience and
what we're personally interested in but
you find other sites and youtubers out
there that are more addressing like
workstation or or server performance for
various different parts yeah like your
level one text or apple window over
there yep so you know it's a perfectly
valid workload gaming I think it's
always good to have a look at you know
all sorts of different things so you
know balance that out with your sort of
view your creative workloads the other
productivity stuff so yeah what are your
thoughts as well in this no I mean
there's no tech media handbook like
we're not all playing by the same rules
it's and I mean Tim and I do this job
because we enjoy it and we do the
content we enjoy doing like I do CPU and
GPU benchmarks because that's what
interests me and I enjoy doing and Tim
does ease in depth monitor stuff because
he enjoys that like before Tim there was
no monitor stuff because I don't really
enjoy the monitor testing but Tina loves
it and he puts together some awesome
content pieces around it which I
actually enjoy watching but I wouldn't
enjoy making them so we do what we enjoy
and we both enjoy gaming even though we
don't really get to do much of it but we
both enjoy it when we get to and yeah we
both like to know how to optimize our
pcs for a good gaming
variance and that's why we make the
content we do and obviously then our
audience want to know about gaming
performance so if I started doing Linux
benchmark or something you guys would
all be scratching I did all the next
video once it got okay views better than
it probably should have but it was more
because it got spread around a bit yeah
I think a lot of use for pcs these days
is you don't really need to benchmark
for it like a lot of people buy pieces
your own web app and I sort of think you
know what how many people out there
using Premiere on their PC or a creative
app like that versus how many people are
gaming and I tend to think it wouldn't
you say there's more PC gamers than
people who using it like premier uh on
planet earth maybe not but yeah mat well
for me is yeah that's right how many
video editors are out there is having a
timers yeah yeah yeah yeah I know you're
saying like a specific app and that's
the other problem because I felt ok so
first of all just to circle back before
you too far into it we do test
applications in all our day one reviews
so we don't just test games to make that
clear usually our further investigations
into performance of gaming focus but we
do in our day line coverage for CPUs
test games but then obviously our sorry
test applications but then when we test
GPUs obviously it's all gaming based
stuff but then you're getting back to
the application thing it's a tough one
as Tim saying because if we test
premiere that means nothing for people
who use Vegas yeah so this applications
no application dependent yeah there's
general things you can take out of like
how long does it take to encoded video
that's similarly sure oh I mean you can
make the same argument for gaming and
not everyone plays the same games but I
think in general you can sort of get
fairly typical like the performance is
fairly constrained within certain bounds
to what you're gonna see
yeah in-game yeah so yeah it's a lot
harder to sort of do the productivity
testing and sort of find relevant stuff
to what people are doing cuz I think a
lot of the things that require a high
performance CPU these days of you know
there's a lot of niche applications but
there's no real like big general thing
that everyone does in their PSA that you
really need like a high performance II I
think it boils down to the fact as well
if I did a 30
benchmark video you guys would love that
and a lot of you would watch it we get a
pretty good percentage of our audience
watching those if I did a 30 application
benchmark not sure that I do super well
and I'm not sure I'd be super interested
in doing it which is probably the main
takeaway there but anyway we've probably
addressed that question from enough
angle I'd say so yeah we'll move on to
the next one and this one is from Jeremy
so it's a question for both of us so we
can both get on the action on this one
what got both of you into the PC world
any source of inspiration hook maybe
family passing down the interest on to
their children or something I'll start
because mine's quick and easy I just
like computers as a kid like we we got a
family computer and I got hooked to that
way both my parents hated it I loved it
and went from there yeah just didn't
really know how to use it I was sort of
grade 5 grade 6 486 it was then I got I
sort of got more into console gaming
after that then in high school got
really interested in how it all worked
building my own computer and then yeah
got my own job saved up some money and
decided to build my own computer fumbled
through that process eventually got it
working and never looked back we hooked
ever since very very similar here it's a
very similar in sort of New York family
had a PC available you know in the house
probably from a younger age and then you
have certainly the entire time I could
remember sort of just when I was just
opening up a word document hearing the
keyboard as a toddler apparently used to
do that to have a bit of fun so yeah
then I didn't really get into console
gaming until after I go into PC game I
sort of did we have this sort of family
PC put it in a GPU in there played a
couple of games and then also our
consoles a sort of thing I'll try that
out and sort of got back into pcs built
built few of my own yeah one for me I
think you know all starts in a similar
way for most people I think you know
those things are just in the house so
you just use them yeah the fun with that
is any particular the least this is my
recollection of the situation the jump
from console to PC if you had like a
voodoo graphics card was significant in
turn
of 3d acceleration graphic performance
and all that yeah so that's really what
got me excited about computers was just
how much bloom onion tender away it's
just amazing and yeah it's interesting
is now that I've been a parent for a
while I've got a six year old and a four
year old and my six year old loves
fortnight because she's a kid and all
their friends play on console and she
wanted to play on console I made her
learn keyboard and mouse and now she's
like so much better than all of the
other kids of the play and she's learnt
computer skills like she can type she
know can use a mouse and keyboard so I
think it's important not to still have
an old old desktop computer because it's
such the hip thing now I think for
families to have tablets
yeah so I think a lot of people not as
many people are going to get into PC
gaming when there's not that family PC
mobile there that you can maybe you know
nag your parents into getting a faster
GPU so you can play fort and I don't
know whatever yeah well none of the kids
know Nana my daughters friends have a
desktop PC at home if you can believe
that or none worth use but it's it's
what's happening these days yeah it's
just not going consoles and tablets it's
always from the previous question where
I say you don't really need a powerful
desktop PC to do a lot of stuff people
use a PC for anymore so people don't
have them so that kids aren't getting
into gaming you're sort of and I'm
getting off topic here on this Q&amp;amp;A but
me and my wife laugh and say it's like
that movie idiocracy or what was it oh
yeah you know they went back to drinking
Gatorade and using that for the crops
and everything that's gonna be like
tablets like we've we've gone back from
typing on desks okay like we've gone
from devices that can be used for
productivity to just content consumption
which is great for everyone watching
YouTube watch us on YouTube please keep
buying your tablets you can watch our
content but anyway probably getting a
bit off topic there but yeah I think
it's good for kids to learn keyboard and
mouse skills because it gives them a
massive head start in my opinion so
enough dr. Phil we'll get on with the
next question which is from net 7 any
thoughts on the continual handicap md
mobile AP use this will be a tim
question I have had since launch and
we'll see
have this second-gen what's he what's he
saying you seem to have with all the
same sorry upcoming generation ie locked
to ddr4 2400 GPU thermal limit of 75
degrees before the GPU and CPU speeds
will tank so sorry during that question
a bit yeah I mean you never want to see
handicaps with any sort of hardware I
think it's just sort of the situation
that they're in with sort of you know
especially on their AMD the rise in
desktop platform with the RAM for
example it's very easy on a desktop to
just run or whatever Ram speeds you want
you just said the XMP profile where you
go you're all good whereas with a laptop
these are all your heavily validated
systems for OEMs and if you if your base
spec is ddr4 2400 and you're not going
to support ddr4 3000 as sort of an
officially supported spec then then you
run into these problems and I think that
you know Amy wants to maintain maximum
compatibility which is why they set it
for 2,400 keep things more affordable we
saw that with my first gen chip that
used to my horizon 7 1700 used to work
with ddr4 3200 degradation of the IMC
and now it only works at like 29 33 or
something and people were like why
you're only testing it that I'm like all
it works at now yeah I can't validate
laptops for that and then have that sort
of situation happen yeah exactly it you
know it'll be great
really great if they could have
validated that for hire but it's just
not gonna happen
the GPU thermal is a bit different I'm
imagining that there's some sort of
reason I engine earring wise why it's
limited to 75 well so AMD you have to
understand I mean again I don't want to
sound like an AMD fanboy or anything
here I'm just trying to state the facts
as they are AMD's fighting many battles
on many fronts and they've been losing
for a while and now they've made a big
comeback with Rison but they've really
got to make some serious inroads with
the OEMs so there's not that much I've
talked about this with the RX 570 versus
the gtx 1650 because of things like
efficiency or however that comes about
AMD components are often cheaper to
purchase but more expensive to integrate
so the laptops will need more cooling
and things like that and because they
haven't had a
track record through the bulldozer days
they don't have the OEM support that
Intel has so you know Dell HP they're
not gonna go oh here's a new AMD APU
let's engineer the crap out of this you
know make it a real premium product use
all the best materials you know big
copper coolers and all that kind of
stuff it's just let's make a really
cheap low-end aimed a unit and move a
couple of those so yeah that I think I
think that those are all issues that
sort of they it's gonna take time that's
right at a time all those things will
come together and I think you know the
second generation of riser mobile ap use
it's it's like a very minor clock speed
increase so it's not nothing to get
crazy we're still saying plus yeah this
tool is m+ so is then to obey the
hundred megahertz more yeah whatever
probably wait till next gen to see what
they've got
well and that's part of the paint a lot
of people have been saying why they only
Zen plus and that's probably a big part
of the reason they're still making those
inroads there's no reason throwing Zen
to our yeah when it's gonna get put in
crap products why is there timelines
world yeah also their timeline the
originals n AP use were 2000 series
products as well so yet yep
alright Peter home minor Amina probably
butchering that name there we've got two
questions from Peter so yep you guys
this is first we've got a second crack
at that do you see a revival of
multi-monitor gaming
setups what about professional use do
use multi display setup so for gaming
it's probably dead so I did a couple of
bench players and a couple of articles
back for text but in the day with those
Adelphi emails if any invidious around
yeah it's just it's not as like I used
to use that set up and I thought oh how
this is gonna be so amazing
there's just so many technical problems
getting it set up and just have a single
21:9 one that is way better it bezels
suck evening everything yeah a life in
metal bezels compatibility all of that
is better with just a single wider Mona
so I think that is where gaming is gonna
go that's what professional you see a
multi you display is still really
popular are you I personally use a 21-9
more and a 16-9 monitor to get
for all my work stuff and that's great
so I think it's not going to die there
but for gaming yes I don't think it's
ever really been great so can't see it
reviving either now I grew up Oliver I
technically use a triple monitor setup
but I use triple computers as well
so I've got my main monitor in the
middle test system test system that's
the most efficient way for me to
benchmark yeah it's pretty nice so yeah
not gonna bother with it the last thing
this time his second question are AVX
instructions important in gaming what do
you reckon that's a pretty tough one to
answer how do you determine if it's
important I don't really know what I
mean we know there's some examples where
they've definitively stated that the
game uses a VX but without knowing how
to games code it's kind of hard to say
whether they yeah so like Assassin's
Creed origins Odyssey those games have a
VX support and we know that they run
significantly better with CPUs that
support a VX because I've done
benchmarks and yeah you're older Intel
x58 Zeon's for example tank in that game
badly without AVX instructions and they
said that the advanced of the AVX
instructions which are CPU commands they
use them for some advanced vector
operations it allows them to do them
faster so which makes sense because
they're advanced vector extensions yep
so that's pretty vague pretty much as
you'd expect yeah and I don't know how
many games are really using AVX
instructions but yeah I don't think it's
I don't think they're vital or super
important for gaming but if ya utilized
they can speed stuff up
yep so we were going to skip this
question from Durazzo one two three but
I've decided to read it because it's
kind of funny
so this keep in mind this question was
asked before the GTX 16:50 was released
because we're filming this late because
Tim was sick again
Timmy um we're never gonna let it down
Tim got C yeah yeah C but I'm gonna read
this question out because it's really
funny having this question asked
before the GTX 16:50 release so here's
the question could the gtx 1650 and gtex
1650 TI potentially turn out to be the
most important releases from Nvidia's
churring lineup so they're not the most
important they could have been really
really really impressive and well yeah
they could have got good reviews from
that but obviously Nvidia didn't want to
part with that silicon for $100 they
wanted to make 150 dollars and that
makes the 1650 kind of crap as we've
said over and over and over again and
$100 it would have got a rave review so
we need a 33% yeah 33% discount
otherwise they can keep their 1650 as
far as I'm concerned yep so a pretty
funny comment looking back at it now but
yeah a good make jar death so this is
Jared from Jared's tech if you haven't
checked out his channel and you care
about laptops and he does really good
GPU comparisons as well then I head over
his channel so that is Jared's Tech
anyway these 16 50 TI a thing again this
was asked before the 1650 launch or
release yep hadn't heard any mention of
it yet so the 1650 ti
we think is the thing that's been
rumoured to be a thing but we have no
concrete evidence but it should be the
full die so the full 2 1 2 u 1 1 6 die
but that's correct so that means it
would have the same I think the same
cruder core count as the GTX 1063
gigabyte and that had probably landed
around gtx 1066 about performance italy
yeah maybe that best I don't know yeah
it's another sm unit so it'd be a little
bit faster but it's they're probably
going to charge once 180 for it so it's
not gonna be good value either you know
so it'll still get beaten by an Rx 570
so it'll actually be a lot worse felt
you probably anyway well I'm just
guessing that's if that car digs
that if it exists and that if it comes
at those specs and that price so yeah
anyway besides the 8700 Kay's you have
do you also have other multiple pieces
of the same hardware
how did that happen a wife well we have
two century 2.0 builds with all the same
hardware so that happened check out that
video if you haven't yeah see we have
287 our case because well we got three
actually but we've got two guys I need
one team needs one sometimes that
happens because we've bought another one
or sometimes that happens because the
company was generally generous enough to
send us to yeah
if we end up with like I think I've got
to Eric's five 90s because I did a
crossfire test yeah just watched your
new video on the RT performance on
Pascal so I'm guessing this was also
from a few weeks ago yep I think so it's
for the great content yeah you you're
welcome
I was cruise if the 1660 TI fares any
better with RT with the added tensor
cause I'm aware it's not pass cap um so
I don't actually have a 1662
yet pretty easy Oh answer so I haven't
tested it but my my assumption is that
it's better than the equivalent Pascal
product but not that much faster and my
assumption is it's still garbage yeah
well pretty muddy tracing enabled the 16
C qti is a fantastic value graphics
cards they put your green pitchforks
down I very much like it but don't use
it for a treat Pascal maybe don't use
ray-tracing I mean unless you have a
really powerful product and you're
already right up there like the limit of
what you're doing and you can sort of
add raytrace and without harming too
much performance but on Pascal man it is
slow and the 1660 ti ya know seeing the
20 80 TI so enough said yeah okay from L
PI question for you maybe Steve how much
would it help to know in RAM sticks
their memory names or more like who did
the memory chips for that stick at least
for these rise and Jen's I think it
helped a lot having them works well with
Rison feels quite clumsy for example
under the spec sheet on the RAM sticks
box that says Samsung be die chips in
you know some kind of layout something
like that you know how much would that
help
oh yeah not much and it probably almost
become like a marketing thing just to
sell memory because I know everyone
loves Samsung beedo and rightfully so
but not all Samsung beador is created
equally so there's a bidding process so
your absolute cream of the crop will end
up on your high frequency with slightly
lower latencies but then you can get
Samsung B die that's not that great and
that'll sell on your cheaper memory so
that doesn't really help either really
you've just got to look at what
overclockers or guys are testing with so
whether it's like your G skill flare X
or Sniper X or you know some sort of
course and memory that will naturally be
using Samsung B die but they they'll
generally use for like a flare X they'll
use binned part to achieve those stuff
at sale 14 for example at 3200 then it's
going to be a higher quality be die chip
so you've sort of you've just got to do
your research really there's no yeah I
mean it's not too difficult because
there are some some brands and series
that we know work well with Rison but
then we don't you don't wanna get too
caught up in the memory thing because
unless you're you know shooting for
absolute maximum FPS with some low
resolution gaming then it doesn't really
matter like if you're gaming with an RT
X 28 ETA at 4k then you your memory
becomes irrelevant really assuming we're
talking about gaming here but then even
for applications the performance uplift
isn't massive anyway with you yeah
tightened memory so you're best off just
yeah doing your research and seeing what
others are finding works well and
hopefully it'll be less of a problem
with then ii don't know we'll find out
revel devil mm asks why do some monitors
have stickers on them that say
compatible with Windows 10 or any other
OS is there any merit to this or is this
just a marketing thing to make the less
tech-savvy people more comfortable about
a purchase I do believe that to get that
sticker on there it does have to go
undergo some sort of validation like
they have to prove something there's
probably some money exchanged or
something like that sticker on there but
yeah basically as you say I think it is
just so that lets take
every people can go you know this one
this is guaranteed to work with what I
have because there's a sticker on the
box yeah I'd be astonished if there was
a monitor that wasn't compatible with
windows days not if it's just something
that shouldn't happen right yeah I mean
if it helps some people and help some
people I don't really see a problem with
it but doesn't matter a lot to me no
it's probably got like a certified
Windows 10 driver or something as well
but I don't know all right Steve what is
your worst experience in benchmarking
worst experience in benchmarking holy
moly through that oh I'm gonna put my
foot in it you saying my worst
experience recently was definitely the
Radeon seven that was a nightmare and
then oh boy I'm throwing myself in the
deep end here and then horizon seven
first-gen so that would have been the
rise and seven what was it the eighteen
hundreds the 1707 maybe had a lot of
problems hard now that was the week from
how for a lot of Czech reviewers so yeah
I am being kind of yeah giving us some
fun there and then apart from any sort
of specific product launches I would say
things that the worst experience when
benchmarking or the worst experience is
like any game that requires you to
either quit to the main menu to change
the resolution or like reset the whole
game for a resolution change that drives
me crazy
monster hunter world is one that comes
to mind you have to quit through the
main menu change the resolution and then
I think the game has to be reset as well
so that sucks a shocker not resetting a
game for quality setting changes is fine
not for me and I hate that well I like
to do it though because you know I do it
even when it tells you not to do it just
because sometimes you do need to do it
so I've gotten to the resolution changes
though that drives me bananas and
anything from the Windows Store yeah we
know Store is so bad so Chris do so but
I've even complain about the epic store
but the Windows Store is still yeah like
ever every few weeks I have a fully
redownload
80 gigabyte falls of horizon for anyway
yeah can't wait to drop the Windows
Store from testing I'm never picking it
up again no matter how much you guys
just my anyway do you guys see AMD
opening up crossfire dx11 support for
Radeon 7 this technology would be hard
to implement on the Radeon 7 considering
similarities Vegas 64 or do you think
there is a hardware reason that dx11
crossfire isn't enabled on the Radeon
seven can see that why there'd be a
hardware reason no I'm more surprised
about the whole crossfire thing I hadn't
even thought about it I had no intention
of ever doing a radio and 7 crossfire
tests for the same reasons I haven't
done any r-tx SLI testing I really don't
like the whole Joule GPU thing because
it's never as good as it seems it hasn't
been good for like a very long time yeah
there's people that argue black and blue
in the face that it's fantastic and
reviewers don't know what they're doing
or this or that or there's always some
excuse but I've had friends use it
nightmare I've tried using the past
because I have like over a hundred GPUs
and I've got a few doubles and it's just
not worth it so now I've done in the
past as well yeah I've gone yeah I've
got to Vega 1503 Vega 56 cards and I
just stick one in my system yep and I
gave up four okay I just don't want to
deal with the headaches associated with
having multiple GPUs it just never works
as well it should so yeah I mean I
haven't really answered that question
but I'm sort of letting you know that I
haven't looked into it because I don't
really care
yeah I don't think they will because
it's a very niche sort of thing yeah
they're probably more focused on just
getting the drivers optimized and
working and new titles for just one GPU
so yeah for some benchmark video is why
sure only a third of the games tested
isn't it a waste of time to test them
but not include them in the video I know
you include them in the conclusion part
but might as well throw them in their
own graph okay I mean isn't it well
there's a few reasons so back when we
started the channel like we used to do
around twelve fifteen games and that was
considered a lot but then I kept you
know people requesting more games I was
interested in how these things matched
up
a wider variants of games and a wider
range of games so we just started
testing more and more but then I think I
can't recall what at what point we
changed to this new format but I
remember when we're getting like 20-plus
games it was the videos were running
past 30 minutes of me just talking about
graph after graph after graph after
graph and I was kind of getting bored
with it like I like just talking about
the new games because I find that
interesting how things are stacking up
in the new games but going over the
witcher 3 the witcher 3 and you know
over and over and over and over and over
again the margins never really change
because it's a you know super old game
now or Grand Theft Auto 5 or whatever it
happens to be I got bored you know
commentating on those results so if I'm
bored doing it I have to imagine that a
lot of people watching it a bored and
there's only so many graphs oh I can
expect you guys to sit through and I'm
talking about the majority of the
audience and I feel like a dozen is kind
of like the most people can handle and
so it's a massive job for me to script a
30 game benchmark and then go through
all the graphs like and then proofing a
30 minute video is you know
significantly more in-depth than a 15
minute video and there's watch time
which is probably the ultimate deciding
factor here is the fact that watch time
really governs how well the video does
so it's sort of watch percentage as well
but anyway there's a whole heap of
factors there for why we've optimized
and I write the end of the day I'm
really most interested in those big
breakdown graphs at the end yeah so much
they they're what really interests me
and I enjoy doing em and that's why I've
sort of made that half the video now is
going through those graphs and cost per
frame and stuff and then if you're
interested the graphs are all on the
patreon page so if you want to check any
of them out for yourself then you can do
that but yeah and I think you guys need
me to break down 30 plus games and spend
40 minutes doing it or whatever Steve do
you and the other guy play with with or
without FPS counters during your
personal gaming sessions one option
allows you to focus on what's really
important when you're in the game so
that must be performance FPS counter and
the other option is playing
I should have just finished the
question and the other option is playing
without FPS counters I think the way I
go about it generally is I set the
gaming PC up correctly or as best I can
get it all fully optimized if it's a new
game I usually fire the game up and if
it doesn't even benchmark I'll run that
tune the settings or just play the game
and work out you know whether I have to
do any resolution downscaling if I have
to adjust any kind of settings and I'll
get in the sweet spot because I say I
play with a Vega 56 mostly I do have a
separate gaming system but I'm too lazy
to use it most of the time so that's
embarrassing but yeah I usually just
workout where I optimize it first then
just play and don't monitor performance
yeah same here bit of FPS counter at the
start to sort of figure out what's
required and then yep switch it off and
you just enjoy it again yeah actually
the only thing I do turn on is ping if I
can if the game has an option most of
the multiplayer games do put my ping up
just like I monitor that so if I die I
can quickly look up and go oh look at
how my ping is flame it on my ping it
helps me it helps me respawn and get
akka Sark and asks what do you guys
think of the current state of PC
hardware and what non GPU CPU hardware
are you hoping to see at Computex this
year um I think the state of peace out
here is probably fine a lot of bitching
and moaning goes on about r-tx and this
and that I mean yeah whoo we've done a
fair bit of RT expanding ourselves but
as I've said many times I think the GTX
1662 I even the RT X 2060 I mean yeah
this is CBM thing but I still think
they're they're pretty good cards
they're certainly better than what the
other team is giving us so I don't have
a problem with the state of things I
think a.m. these CPUs a fantastic value
for money so the CPU front certainly
never been anywhere near as good as it
is right now yeah yeah and the GPU
fronts fine we've got what memory prices
have come down SSD prices have come down
it's kind of funny I always sort of
think what the hell are you on about
when people bitch and moan about how
terrible PC gaming is right now and that
RTX cards suck and in videos milking us
dry and yadda yadda yadda I'm like yeah
I can't see me coming from it at the
same time were you alive like eight
months ago
a twelvemonth like how bad wasn't last
year
yeah like GPU prices double the MSRP Ram
prices were insane so yeah I mean it's
pretty good I did a video in January
saying now is a good time to build a PC
and I still think now is a good time to
build a PC at this point I probably wait
tools and two comes along and Navi and
whatnot but yeah I mean you can build a
PC for a reasonable amount amount of
money and I'll let you play all the
latest and greatest games at pretty high
quality settings yeah so what more can
you ask for I hoping you see Computex
probably just I mean we're hoping for
you know some new announcements and that
sort of thing from the big companies as
you would expect probably not too much
from Intel and video on that front but
certainly AMD yeah I think everyone's
pumped for what imb is gonna bring
really yeah I think that's that's pretty
much it I mean you said non GPU and CPU
hardware so I mean they're the new x5 7u
motherboard which are rumored to be
there I'm not super exciting but that's
something at least I just like going
around and seeing sort of the not
necessarily the products that you can be
bought now but sort of like the
prototype stuff that is sort of gonna
become what's available the next couple
years like when you see you see this or
a new thing that there are companies
working on you're like oh that's kind of
interesting
some of it is seems really dumb like
you're water-cooled power supplies more
memory you know yeah yeah I mean but
that's the other thing as well like
they're really trying to they're trying
to stand out and for us that's a good
thing like again mechanical keyboards
mice storage your SSDs cases power
supplies like the amount of options we
have available now and they're all
really competitively priced so I think
the PC how our market is awesome at the
moment personally it's good final
question here final one well this time
when is your preferred time to benchmark
do you guys prefer to start during the
day or during the night about you sorry
I don't do a whole ton of benchmarking
like you do a lot of my monitor testing
and stuff I usually just do it might
sort of like watch your TV show do some
benchmarking because it's kind of you
just sit there you get the numbers you
into Excel and go away with it what
about you yes funny I like to have a TV
show on I'm focused on the benchmarking
it's kind of weird I don't actually
watch I used to do a lot of
documentaries and I sort of it's like
yeah I'm Kai - you listen like yeah yeah
yeah yeah like a podcast it's kind of
background noise and it makes the boring
parts of writing the same benchmark over
and over again less boring and then I
get the results which I find interesting
so yeah for me the afternoon is
definitely when I usually start testing
and then depending on how much testing
I've got to do I can go onto the earlier
was the morning of the next day but yeah
I don't like to benchmark in the morning
that's that's my email time all right I
see yeah I sort of my the worst girl
who's kind of interesting like usually
the second half the day afternoon that's
usually like video editing time like
video production yeah yeah doing b-roll
sort of like getting all the stuff
required for videos and either that will
then go into you know for that video if
it is going out that day so putting that
all together and uploading it or just
collecting that or for the next sort of
time in the morning I tend to do a lot
of like finishing up testing script
writing okay
well that's sort of things sort of get
that done and sort of do some other
things and then testing can be done
around that yeah that's not too
dissimilar to myself so I have two
different types of days one day is a day
where I film and the format's slightly
different and one days a day where I
test so but generally the morning is
gather bad emails I usually do that for
a bit then have breakfast I've had a bit
more emails so just business side of
things whether it's organising samples
going back and forth with companies on
problems or working things out or
whatever and then from that I usually
move into your script writing or if it's
a filming day I go film then edit so and
that's pretty much that day and then on
the days that aren't filming yeah script
writing research I usually do that up
till about lunchtime have lunch and then
I usually have to get into some form of
testing and then I do that for as long
as it takes so yeah that's that's kind
of how I've structured that's how my
body and brain life to handle things and
it works well well thank you to all
patreon members for their continued
support and their
fantastic questions that was a lot of
fun that wraps up the april q and A's
and we'll do it all again in about three
weeks so actually we might have to
squeeze that in before Computex yeah
Computex the last week of May so we're
gonna empty by the time you guys are
watching this it's probably less than
three weeks yep before we go so yeah
we'll see how we go we're not even doing
at Computex I don't know who knows we'll
see how much time we've got that would
be kind of cool we'll probably do a live
stream from Computex as well yeah that
we did one last year so do it again make
a mix alright we'll work it out
thank you very much for watching as
always
and what are you making me dress they
start I fooled you in the last one might
Rock any day I'm Yours Tim I will see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
