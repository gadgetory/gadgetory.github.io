announced their first ROG Strix gaming
laptop the light and compact GL 502 as
you might expect from a strict branded
laptop the GL 502 means business but
surprisingly isn't over the top and
certainly is an overpriced Asus gone
with a high quality yet compact 15.6
inch display in spite of the modest
footprint this thing also packs a real
punch with the core i7 6700 HQ at its
heart along with a very capable geforce
gtx 970m while there's also a 980 m
model as well so Core i7 processor
GeForce graphics card this Sol sounds
really expensive in a gaming laptop but
surprisingly it really isn't over in the
u.s. potential buyers are faced with an
asking price of $1,250 down from 1,500
just weeks ago well that's Ozzie's can
snag one for as little as 2,100 so
what's the capture here you ask well
let's find out the ROG streaks GL 502
certainly looks and feels like a quality
laptop so no corners have been cut here
right away the brushed aluminium black
top cover grabs your attention as to
those nuclear looking neon orange
highlights I can't say this would be my
first design choice but I have to hand
it to a soos it's anything but boring
towards the back of the top cover you'll
find a nice-looking fluorescent Republic
of gamers emblem in the center as much
as I do like this lead design it does
come with one drawback it's a
fingerprint magnet go anywhere near this
thing with oily hands and you'll
instantly leave your mark so neat freaks
would want to keep microfiber cloth
handy at all times
underneath the laptop we find a durable
plastic backing which has been given a
rough yet nice feeling texture again the
fluorescent orange highlights are on
display here in the form of four very
funky looking rubberized feet lifting
the dual hinge lid reveals this mobile
gaming station and all of its black and
orange glory the 15.6 inch display
features a fairly large plastic bezel
featuring a 1280 by 720 HD webcam in the
top middle the bezel also features a
number of rubberized buffers that help
avoid marking the screen when the laptop
is folded up moving to the keyboard area
we find more plastic this time given the
same brush texture as the aluminium lid
of course the room more orange
highlights here which include another
ROG logo as well as some aggressive
looking speaker grills the full
sighs chiclet style keyboard also
features fluorescent orange text which
is red backlit for a seriously cool
effect there are three brightness levels
and of course the backlighting can be
disabled entirely to save battery life
the WASD Keys are orange with black
lettering and weld after screams gaming
laptop doesn't it that said what doesn't
scream gaming laptop is the complete
lack of dedicated macro keys hardcore
gamers might frown at the chiclet
keyboard we'll have to admit it feels
quite good for a laptop keyboard the
keys feature a travel distance of 1
point 6 millimeters which is slightly
better than your typical chiclet
keyboard while they require 55 grams of
pressure to actuate the keys feel firm
with no wobble and provide satisfying
feedback when pressed the keyboard does
feature a numpad and the power button
has been integrated into the top right
hand corner which I guess is kind of
neat the touchpad which for the most
part is going to be disabled on a gaming
laptop is surprisingly large at 105 by
75 millimeters it's nice and smooth
while offering responsive jitter free
cursor movement the click pad has been
integrated into the touchpad itself and
while it does produce nice loud clicks
you can't for example click the left
button hold it down and then click the
right button it's very much a one button
at a time deal overall it's a nice
looking layout and despite being a small
gaming laptop the GL 502 doesn't seem to
give that impression in total it
measures 388 millimeters long 266
millimeters deep and just 22.8
millimeters thick these modest
dimensions mean that it weighs in at
just 2.1 kilograms or 4.8 pounds getting
inside the laptop to make upgrades is
relatively easy the entire bottom panel
can be removed once no less than 10
Phillips head screws have been removed
the CPU and GPU are both soldered
directly into the main PCB so there's no
chance of upgrading either of these
components in the future I should also
note that there's only a single s Odom
slot available for expansion
this means the pre-installed a gigabyte
module which is on the opposite side of
the PCB and not easily accessed without
dismantling pretty much the entire
laptop is there to stay still this means
by adding a relatively inexpensive a
gigabyte ddr4 module you can double the
laptops memory capacity perhaps just as
important is the fact that you'll also
be enabling dual channel memory which
will significantly increase the
available memory bandwidth upgrades can
also be made to the storage the GL 502
can be purchased with pre-configured
second
one terabyte 7200 rpm hard drive though
this particular model I have doesn't
feature any kind of two and a half inch
storage at all the primary storage
device is however an m2 SSD and while
the base configuration for this laptop
is a 128 gigabyte model the version I
have features a 256 gigabyte drive the
particular driving questions the super
snappy Samsung S m95 1mv mas s team when
it comes to connectivity I would say the
GL 502 is reasonably well equipped
naturally there's no connectivity at the
front or rear a soos is stuck everything
towards the back of the left and right
sides which helps neaten things up
starting with the left side we find a DC
power input gigabit ethernet port with
clip cover mini DisplayPort HDMI USB 3.0
port and a single USB 3.1 type-c gen 2
port which sadly doesn't support
Thunderbolt 3 meanwhile the right side
features a Kensington lock SD card
reader 2 more USB 3 ports and a
three-and-a-half millimeter combo audio
jack the USB ports are spread far enough
apart that you can access them both
simultaneously using wide thumb drives
and dongles the 15.6 inch display for me
is the highlight of the GL 502 the model
I have does feature a 4k display which I
feel is overkill for the gtx 970m GPU
but it does look amazing for those
wondering you can purchase the laptop
with a 1080p screen and this is what I
recommend you get something else that I
can really appreciate is the matte
finish no highly reflective gloss screen
here
the only possible drawback I see is the
lack of juicing support is this would
have been the perfect pairing with that
GeForce GPU the display features
in-plane switching technology inverse
the brightness of 300 nits in a contrast
ratio of 900 to 100 which are very
respectable for a laptop screen throwing
up a solid black image full screen with
the brightness set to max I couldn't
detect any backlight bleeding around the
edges naturally there were no dead
pixels though if you are unlucky here
asus does offer a zero dead pixel policy
as you'd expect from a quality IPS panel
the colors are rich and the blacks were
very black overall I'm very happy with
the quality of the display complementing
the impressive visuals are a pair of
small upward facing speakers that hide
behind these orange grilles that I spoke
of earlier the speakers are certainly
loud enough and the quality is decent
though they do lack bass almost entirely
which does detract from the experience
somewhat that said most gamers are nerd
yeah I'll be rocking your headset so
given the price point this certainly
isn't a deal breaker before we jump into
the benchmarks let's just go over the
full spec list as well as the alternate
options as mentioned previously in my
model which is the GL 502 VT fi0 470
comes loaded with a core i7 6700 HQ
geforce gtx 970m with 3gb of VRAM eight
gigabytes of ddr4 2133 memory a 256
gigabyte nvme SSD and a 15.6 inch 4k IPS
display the two and a half inch storage
options include a one terabyte 7200 rpm
or 5400 rpm drive
we're alternatively a 2 terabyte 5400
rpm drive none of which are in the model
I have there are also options for 128
gig or 512 GB SSD and some models come
with 16 gigabytes of memory as standard
there is also the option to purchase the
GL 502 with a core i5 6200 HQ though I
haven't seen that model on sale yet at
least not down under those wanting more
GPU horsepower should seek out the 980 m
model though we recommend avoiding the
Ultra HD 4k version all models receive
wireless networking support via an Intel
dual band wireless AC m2 module capable
of theoretical transfer rates of up to
867 megabits per second the module
integrates bluetooth 4.2 and wider as
standard we experience no connectivity
or dropout issues during our testing the
same internal force cell 15 point 2 volt
4240 milliamp hour lithium-ion battery
pack is featured inside all models the
battery can be replaced but you have to
remove the back cover much like what you
do for a memory upgrade should you
purchase a new battery I should point
out they aren't exactly cheap starting
at around 130 ozzie now let's get to the
good stuff how does this thing perform
in our tests I've run a few benchmarks
in some of the latest games to give you
a good idea of how it stacks up
unfortunately I don't have a lot of
gaming laptops to compare it to but you
can get a good idea about how performs
relative to our desktop GPU results all
tests would run of course at 1080p with
the maximum in-game quality settings
first up we've got call of duty black
ops 3 and here the GL 502 performed as
expected right on par with the gigabyte
P 57 W that featured the same GPU
this man has slightly edged out the
desktop GTX 960 I'm a server
FPS behind the unknown 380 it was good
to see the laptop get over 60 FPS on max
settings next up was rise to the Tomb
Raider and the results were similar for
the most part we saw an average of 56
fps with a minimum of 36 and this was a
little faster than the uh 9 380 this
time and exactly on par with the gtx 960
moving up the food chain the r9 390 was
well ahead on 78 FPS the third game
tester was the rather demanding Tom
Clancy's the division here the GL 502
was only good for 35 FPS with the ultra
quality setting and this was again on
par with the P 57 W and the gtx 960 the
r9 380 jumped ahead again this time by 9
FPS on average keeping the GL 502
humming along or a pair of 60 millimeter
blower fans each of which is connected
to its own array of copper fins these
copper heat seems to connect it to one
another via a pair of flat heat pipes
which pass over the CPU and GPU the GPU
VM is also covered by a copper heat
spreader
it's an elegant solution seems to work
well and the light load the fans very
quiet and based on my crude measurements
never generated much over 30 decibels
under load when gaming the fans do creep
up quite a bit as you might expect and
in the process generate around 40
decibels volume wise GL 502 is fairly
typical for a gaming laptop I did
appreciate how the fans only spin up
gradually so you don't get that annoying
fan surging noise over and over again
causing the fans to spin up R of course
the CPU and GPU which generate quite a
bit of heat under load given that this
is a very thin gaming laptop we expect
to the GL 502 to run very hot indeed
when gaming our temperature gun reported
a maximum surface temperature of 62
degrees for the keyboard side and 66
degrees for the bottom it's actually not
bad though like most gaming laptops
it'll become quite uncomfortable in the
life during the summer season the 180
what power brick is big but not
ridiculously big so you won't have too
much trouble transporting it around in
total there's a little over three meters
worth of power cord as for the battery
life a suits claimed six hours with the
Wi-Fi constantly active in the screen
brightness set to 50% we consistently
got around five and a half hours out of
the GL 502 which isn't bad given the
hardware inside once fully depleted the
battery takes a little over 2 hours to
fully recharge coming away from this
review I'm extremely pleased with this
rog streak slappy given the timing isn't
great to be checking out a laptop sporty
Maxwell GPU but at 1,250 us the GL fiber
2 is difficult to pass up I should point
out that the model New Ager selling
doesn't come with the SSD but that said
it does boast a 1 terabyte hard drive
and 16 gigabytes of memory so still an
amazing deal of course you can still add
an m2 SSD which opens up a huge number
of possibilities the cheapest gtx 1060
enabled laptops start around 1550
dollars with most price much closer to
2000 us frankly if a 1080p gaming gtx
970m is still more than capable and
while i really love what the gtx 1060
has to offer mobile gamers for the money
the GL 502 is just too hard to pass up
the truly awesome news being that the GL
502 is destined to receive the gtx 1060
is a soos prepares to release the GL 502
vm while the GL 502 V s will spot the
gtx 1070 no doubt they'll cost
considerably more than the 970 m model
though sadly down under we aren't saying
the same discounts as us shoppers though
it has to be said even at $2,100 the ACS
GL 502 is competitive in our market in
Northland the GTX 1060 gaming laptops
seem to be coming in at around $2,500
with most priced a few hundred dollars
more the only slight hiccup for an
otherwise perfect product is the limited
12 month warranty which comes as
standard meanwhile the larger yet
similarly priced gigabyte P 57 W that I
reviewed recently comes with a two-year
warranty and this has become a standard
for most new gigabyte laptops the asus
warranty is top notch in the sense that
it covers even a single dead pixel or
accidental damage the only issue being
the duration when compared to a key
competitors such as gigabyte keeping
pricing and everything else in mind the
asus rog Strix GL fiber - is without
question a keeper
the new clear orange highlights are fun
the 15.6 inch IPS panel is beautiful the
performance speaks for itself what do
