the big day we can now share with you
lots of information about AMD's upcoming
rise in 3000 CPUs and Navi GPUs
including the big news of a 16 core
process and to GPU announcements on top
of that there's new software features
architecture details to discuss and more
so I'll try summarize this mountain of
information in the best way possible and
there should be some tidbits that
weren't covered in AMD's recent III live
stream so definitely worth watching the
whole thing if you are interested in
these things let's start with the 16
core CPU called the Rison 939 50x with
one swift slide among a mountain in
their press decks AMD blew a big chip
late-- sized hole in our guesses from
Computex a few weeks back where we said
AMD might hold off on this chip until
next year we were a little short on the
month in the end the CPU isn't launching
with the other Rison 3000 series
products but will be available in
September of this year we did get basic
specifications 16 cores 32 threads 3.5
gigahertz base clock 4.7 gigahertz boost
clock 72 megabytes of cash and a 105
watt TDP to match AMD's are the high-end
CPUs again TDP isn't a great metric for
comparisons here because all of the 3800
X 3900 X and 39 50x are sitting at 105
watts so we'll have to wait for Steve's
review to see real power consumption
figures AMD didn't reveal pricing
information during the tech day instead
leaving that for the live stream we've
made this video before the live stream
so most of you will probably already
know what this extent core will cost if
you didn't catch that
we'll leave a pinned comment below with
the details now that we have the full
rise in 3000 picture with all the SKUs
as expected the initial leaks were
pretty much too good to be true we
didn't end up getting a 16 core part at
over 5 gigahertz with a price tag under
$500 but what AMD is actually delivering
in the end is still very impressed
bringing 16 cores to the mainstream
desktop platform in a package that's
suitable for both creators and gamers is
nothing to sneeze at especially given
the position
ambi cpu division was in just a few
years ago personally we weren't sure
whether AMD would release the 16 core
part this year or keeping in the bag
next year we had a few theories that AMD
would strategically hold this part back
but like a lot of guesses you don't get
everything right
of course as we mentioned our recap
video the 16 core part was always
possible we never really doubted its
existence but the launch has come a bit
earlier than we anticipated given the
state of Intel CPU division we have a
lot more Zen to information here as well
so I'll run through the key points in
dot point form and then we'll talk GPUs
a little bit later so it's sent to
there's low memory latency assisted by
doubled l3 cache which delivers up to
21% improvements in 1080p gaming going
on AMD's numbers AMD showed the rise in
9 3900 X so the 12 core part trading
blows with the core I nine ninety nine
hundred K in gaming at 1080p losses in
titles like Devil May Cry 5 and
overwatch but wins in csgo and pub G of
course the 12 core part is much better
in a number of creative focused
workloads as well although gains are
limited Turin 14% in handbrake according
to Andy but larger gains and other tasks
similar story for the rise in 730 800 X
versus the core i7 9700 K in 1080p
gaming trading blows although perhaps a
little slow in this relative comparison
interestingly this wasn't a 3,800 X
versus 9900 k comparison although the
3,800 X is priced much closer to the
9700 K which is why they've chosen that
battle the 3,600 X is shown again
trading blows with its competitor Intel
6 core Core i5 9600 K but it pulls away
more substantially in creative workloads
where the 9600 K is a bit limited all
three chips are shown to be more
efficient in AMD's testing as you'd
expect for the platform we have a number
of cool features straight off the CPU
our 24 pci you four point eight lanes
four of which are reserved for the x5 70
chipset 16 lanes are then for graphics
and 4 for nvm a devices directly
attached to the cpu the x5 70 chipset
supports 12 flexible PCIe 4.0 lanes out
of it with the configuration varying
depending on the board so this could
mean as many as three piece of a 4.0
drives through the chipset
or to PCIe drives and for sighted
devices etc you can see all the
configurations here memory overclocking
capabilities are supposedly excellent
with this new generation ddr4 3200 is
the officially supported spec however
AMD are claiming they've achieved ddr4
5100 on air thanks to their new memory
controller design we heard at Computex
that ddr4 4000 and above should be
easily achievable on authorizing CPUs
with mid 4000 clocks doable without
anything crazy hence why many boards
support above ddr4 4400 however AMD
claims that the sweet spot for
performance will be ddr4 37:33 with the
Infinity fabric tying to the memory
clock and a one to one ratio up to that
point beyond that it switches into a two
to one mode so the raw memory latency
for ddr4 4400 is actually below that of
ddr4 3200 that'll mean that for some
workloads the higher performance memory
will be more suitable and for others
potentially gaming you might want to
keep it below that 37:33 mark we'll have
to test that to find which are the best
memory configurations for various
workloads overclocking support for the
CPU is also improved thanks to a better
version of Bryson master on top of that
precision boost overdrive now delivers
up to 200 megahertz of automatic
overclocking should you enable the
feature and have good enough cooling AMD
did divulge quite a lot of information
on the Zen 2 architecture specifically
most of this stuff is beyond the normal
scope of the channel so if you are
interested in the nitty gritty
architecture details I suggest heading
over to Anandtech or a source like that
you often do a fantastic job of covering
the architecture that said I'll show the
summary slide here where you can see
features like an improved branch
predictor larger l3 cache larger micro
app cache doubled floating-point
capabilities and improved integer
processing with most areas of the design
increasing in size one thing that will
interest you guys is the CCX layout of
each triplet some speculated one
shifflett would be one eighth course ECX
whoever there are actually two four core
eight thread CC X's per triplet die
thanks to seven nanometers every CC X is
47% small though with great scope for
scaling
the windows 10 May 2019 update is
optimized for Zen as well taking clock
selection times from 30 milliseconds
down to just one to two milliseconds
which allows for faster clock ramping
with Rison 3000 we're also getting
better topology awareness for the CCX
design and this gives up to a 15%
improvement to performance just from the
windows update all rise in seven and
rising nine processes come with the
Wraiths prism cooler as well if you like
using the Box cooler including that
top-end rise and 9 processor
ok that's most of the interesting CPU
and risin 3000 wavers stuff out of the
way let's move into some Navi discussion
aim they are today announcing the Radeon
rx 5700 series which encompasses two
GPUs the RX 5700 XT and the RX 5700
these are the only GPUs AMD are
announcing at this stage so if you're
hoping for a big 20 80 TI killer or a
flagship to take on nvidia you'll have
to wait a bit longer the RX 5700 xt is
the faster of the two cards offering 40
compute units for a total of 2560 stream
processes up to 9.75 teraflops of
performance up to a 1905 mega hertz
boost clock and eight gigabytes of gddr5
to 14 gigabits on a 256 bit bus for 448
gigabytes per second of bandwidth you
also see here a game clock of 1755
megahertz this is the clock AMD expects
the card to run out in typical games
with the boost clock more of a top-end
figure 64 dropsy and 256 text units as
well then we have the Radeon Arts 5700
which cuts the compute unit figure down
to 36 many we have 2304 stream
processors the boost and game clock are
lower at 1725 and 16 25 megahertz
respectively however the memory Rob and
texture unit configuration is the same
as the XT model te peas are a little on
the high side still the 5700 XT is rated
at 225 watts and the 5,700 at 180 watts
while performance and efficiency could
be a big step in the right direction MDR
pitting the 225 watt 5700 XT up against
invidious RT x 2070 which is a 175 watt
card which indicates that their
efficiency still
quite they're at the level of Nvidia
I'll blast you here with some of AMD's
performance numbers of course take these
with a grain of salt given we haven't
tested the cards yet across a series of
games many of which do reasonably well
on AMD Hardware aimed he has the 5700 XT
around 30% ahead of Vega 56 and 5% ahead
of the our Tex 2070 although it does
lose to the our Tex 2070 in shadow of
the Tomb Raider for example at 1440p
meanwhile the rx 5700 is around 10%
faster than the ITX 2060 at 1440p as
with the 16 core rise in CPU I don't
have pricing information provided ahead
of time but I'm expecting that to have
been already unveiled during the live
stream again we'll have that info in the
pinned comment below and will refrain
from making any value judgments just yet
because we really don't know where it
will stack up hopefully it will sound
decent and we do expect of course
mid-range type pricing for this again
enjoy a shelf date for the cards but no
exact launch date at this stage of
course there is more Navi information to
go through first up you'll have noticed
the blower design used once again for
the reference models a few of you will
be disappointed that AMD aren't going
with the triple fan open air solution of
the Radeon 7 but we are looking at an
aluminium shroud and backplate there's
an acoustically tuned contour in the
cooler and the 5700 XT has a 7 phase of
erm that's overclocking ready and
supports power through an 8 and 6 pin
connector another big addition for
monitor fans is an upgraded Radeon
display engine with display stream
compression 1.2 a support this means up
to 4k at 240 Hertz is supported as is 4k
144 Hertz through a single cable
although these cards don't support hdmi
2.1 and we also showed off the first
display with DSC support from a soos a
43 inch 4k 144 hertz model with display
hgl 1000 capabilities all through a
single cable so that is pretty neat ok
let's talk some Navi architecture stuff
now in particular our DNA since there's
been a lot of discussion on what this
means again a lot of the stuff I only
talked about is beyond our normal scope
so check out and they're taken others
for more in-depth information but there
are a few interesting tidbits in here
with our DNA the compute unit has been
redesigned to allow for better
performance and efficiency so it's not
just as
simple copy of GCN or a slight evolution
here ambi claims reduced execution
latency better single thread performance
improved cache design and better
resource pooling through a to see you
work group design the multi-level cache
hierarchy in particular brings huge
gains to bandwidth in some areas plus
reduce the latency compared to GCN all
of this allows for around 25 percent
more performance per clock and this
performance gain raises to 50% when AMD
compares GCN and our DNA in a same power
same configuration scenario of which a
significant chunk is down to 7 animators
when comparing AMD's 40 nanometer GC and
GPU at 495 square millimeters in Vega 64
compared to their new 7 nanometre Navi
GPU at 251 square millimeters Navi has
14% better performance and consumes 23
percent less power for a total
performance per watt gain of 1.5 X and
interestingly with such a huge size
disparity you'd have to wonder what AMD
could do with say 80 compute units
hopefully we see something like that in
the future because it could really
challenge invidious top end GPUs the
radio and the multimedia engine has been
upgraded to support vp9 decoding at up
to 8k 24 and 4k 90 + 80 BC encoding at
4k 60 and decoding at 4k 90 will be
interesting to see how this fares for
game streamers who want to use AMD's
engine here for quick encoding of their
gameplay as for ray-tracing both Sony
and Microsoft has announced that their
consoles will support rate racing in
some form using Navi GPUs however
Navi for desktop PCs will not include
any hardware level rate racing support
instead that will be supported at a
shade level with next-gen our DNA aka
our DNA to set to integrate it on a
hardware level whether or not this means
next-gen consoles are also using
next-gen our DNA GPUs we're not really
sure on that one for now as for next-gen
our DNA that is currently codenamed our
DNA - its I just mentioned and will hit
us before 2021 on 7 nanometre plus
obviously AMD isn't ready to give more
information on that but wait there's
more we're also getting a slew of new
software features in
software adrenaline 2019 edition version
19 point 7.1 yep
that is a long official name but it will
be available on July 7th aside from the
usual UI and settings improvements AMD
are introducing new features such as
display aware tuning a mode that sets
frame rate caps to match the monitor
refresh rate which has a range of
benefits
there's also Radeon anti lag which aims
to improve click to response times and
each box tiles by better timing and
optimizing the CPU and GPU output in
games more interesting than that is
Radeon image sharpening to me this is
far more compelling than invidious dl SS
technology for starters it's a
post-processing effect with a little to
no performance impact it uses contrast
adaptive sharpening to improve image
quality and it can be combined with
optional GPU upscaling to format DL SS
type solution where you run at a sub
native resolution to improve performance
then sharpen it back up to a near native
presentation given that unlike TLS s the
sharpening phase isn't performance
intensive aim D says about a 1%
performance drop this tech has the
potential to deliver the same
performance benefits of DL SS with
better image quality and just to rub it
in to in the video further Andy says
this new feature is supported in
thousands of games not just the handful
that dealer says does in other words it
doesn't sound like it requires developer
integration which is a huge benefit of
this technology however to access this
feature you will need an rx 5700 series
GPU developers can also integrate a
similar feature into game's natively if
they'd like through AMD's new fidelity
FX open-source program there is aiming
to work on better post-processing
effects like this finally AMD also
unveiled two new AP users bit of a loki
unveil to be honest but I guess that's
what happens when you've also got sent
to CPUs coming out unlike the rest of
the rise in 3000 series the new Rison
330 200g and risin 530 400g are Zen plus
chips which bring increased clock speeds
the 3200 G now sits at a 3.6 gigahertz
base and 4.0 gigahertz boost on the CPU
up from 3.5 and 3.7 gigahertz with the
2200 G the GPU clock also goes from 1100
megahertz to 1250 megahertz
then with a 3400 G the base clock also
goes up by a hundred megahertz and the
boost clock jumps from 3.9 to 4.2
gigahertz GPU clock increases from 1250
megahertz to 14 hundred megahertz same
configuration for both parts so the rise
in 3 is 4 cores and 4 threads with a
Vega 8 GPU while the horizon 5 years 4
cores and 8 threads with Vega 11 the
3400 G also benefits from a wraith spire
cooler in the box new high quality metal
Tim and PB o overclocking support
unfortunately we didn't get any launch
pricing or details on this so we really
don't know when these CPUs are coming or
what they'll be priced at but we expect
them to come out reasonably soon and
that's it I think that's everything
knowing just how much content amy has
just unleashed I'm sure I've missed
something along the way but hopefully
I've covered all the big and important
details but from all this information
you should definitely still have a much
better idea of how the rise in 3000
series is shaping up when most CPUs
launch on July 7 as well as the first
look at new Navi GPUs also launching in
