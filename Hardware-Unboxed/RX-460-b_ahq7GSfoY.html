seems this time around we're checking
out the new Radian rx 460 the GP for
gamers that aren't willing to sacrifice
everything else in their life for the
sake of high resolution ultra qaulity
gameplay based on p'lice 11 the RX 460
will likely be the most affordable
gaming GPU AMD released in 2016
unfortunately due to timing I don't
actually know the MSRP for the rx 460 is
aimed yet to release that information as
I'm putting this review together there
are three days to go before the official
release and unfortunately I can't wait
until the last minute to finalize
everything if you're watching this on
launch day the 8th I'm currently away in
Bangkok containing an Nvidia launch
event for a new unnamed high-end product
which I'll no doubt be feeling you guys
in on shortly so keep your eye out for a
video later this week covering the event
and any other shenanigans I get up to
while staying in Bangkok
although I don't know the official MSRP
I can take an educated guess based on my
findings and I'll do so in the final
stages of this review once again I'll be
using my new sub $200 graphics card
testing rig powered by a modestly clock
skylight core i3 6100 T processor this
system does a good job of representing
the kind of rigs gamers purchasing the
affordable graphics cards will likely be
running the system is built into the
fractal design to find an OS and
features a gigabyte z170 and Wi-Fi
motherboard the only unrealistic
hardware used is a 16 gigabyte ddr4
memory kit a 2 terabyte SSD and an 850
watt power supply the 2 terabyte SSD has
been used simply because I need to
install the heap of games for testing
and the 850 watt power supply is simply
because I had a spare unfortunately as
was the case with the RX 470 review I
had very limited time to get this review
done so again just 12 games been tested
at one resolution though it is the
extremely popular 1080p res in the
coming weeks I'll be preparing a few RX
470 and rx 460 partner card reviews this
is where I'll focus on overclocking
performance although I'm using a factory
overclocked sapphire rx 460 for testing
it's being underclock to meet the
reference AMD clock specifications this
has been done to keep the results fair
as all other cards tested have also been
done at the reference AMD and NVIDIA
specifications ok so that gets the
important stuff out of the way let's get
to the results shall we
we'll kick off things again with
Superman somehow worthy foe here the
60 produced 47 frames per second with
the minimum of 33 this was right around
the performance of the gen 1 r7 370 and
45% slower than the RX 417 this is
honestly a slightly bigger gap than I'd
expected between these two cards for 750
Ti uses however it's a big step up and
you stand again 34% performance in this
game next up is Star Wars Battlefront
and here the 460 rendered 53 FPS on the
high quality setting at 1080p this time
it was a little closer to the recently
release 470 coming at 40% slower was
also 40% faster than the 750 Ti black
ops 3 was very playable on the high
quality setting with anti-aliasing
disabled the 460 was good for 54 fps and
a 47 FPS minimum 13% faster than the r7
370 which made 48 fps
performance was virtually on par with
the GTX 950 as the 460 was 2% faster
next I tested Duman Vulcan with the
ultra quality preset and a a disabled
the 460 made a healthy 81 FPS here was a
considerable 62 percent faster than the
750ti Vulcan also allowed the 460 to
shoot ahead of the 950 by 13% but it was
46 percent behind the 470 I dialed
Mirror's Edge catalyst down to medium
for these cards and here the 460 managed
50 fps this was 28% faster than the 750
Ti which was one of the closer margins
seen between these cards the 460 was
also within 32 percent of the 470 and
36% of the 480 the hardware friendly
triple-a title overwatch was next and at
1080p on Ultra you can expect around 73
FPS from the 416 this seems really good
but it was only three percent faster
than the 370 and was five percent slower
than 750 Ti this is the only game with a
750 Ti I had a slight edge Far Cry
primal is a demanding game and here we
found that on the high quality setting
the 460 could produce 42 FPS this is 24%
more than the 750 Ti nine percent less
than the GTX 950 and thirty percent less
than the i9 380 in our Lord of the Rings
themed game the 460 made 43 FPS on the
ultra quality setting which isn't bad
this was 50% less than the rx 480 and
10% less than the GTX 950 performance
was pretty much on par with the 370
though with the 460 managing just a
single extra frame interestingly though
the 460 had a much higher minimum frame
rate the division is another demanding
game and here the 460 could be 39 FPS on
average this is just about on par with
the GTX 950 and Ape
faster than 370 750ti users can expect a
39% performance boost in this game at
1080p
I tested rise of the Tomb Raider in its
DirectX 12 mode with a very high quality
setting and the 460 produced 49 frames
per second this was slightly higher than
the 370 and 29% faster than the 750ti
total war Warhammer was also run through
its DirectX 12 test and the four sixties
performance was pretty decent it beat
the 370 by a solid 15 percent and the
950 by 31 percent was also a little
closer to the 470 and 480 that it
typically has been this time with in 37
and 39 percent respectively the last
game I looked at was The Witcher 3 Wild
Hunt here the 460 was on par with the
950 with a 40 FPS average was also 38%
faster than the 750ti
and 8% faster than the 370 I recorded
the total system power consumption after
20 minutes of gameplay on average the RX
460 configuration consumed 139 watts
which is good and certainly a step
forward for AMD however it's not wildly
impressive when you compare it to the
previous generations gtx 950 which was
basically on par performance wise
overall but only use 9 more watts it's
obviously important to note that the
card tested is not in fact a reference
card but sapphires nitro Edition when it
comes to power consumption and
temperatures the cooler looks pretty big
on this thing but interestingly it still
ran at 75 degrees the card was virtually
dead silent though so obviously this
could be improved with a more aggressive
fan curve well there you have it this
low-end card was never going to be a
world beater so our overall opinion is
very much going to be price dependent
unfortunately at this point I don't have
the pricing information as mentioned
before we make any conclusions and
speculate on price let's take a look at
the how this card compared directly with
some of its competition the RX 460 was
overall 41% slower than the Big Brother
470 and I guess this was a little more
of a gap than I was expecting
I'm definitely hoping now that this card
comes in around 40% cheaper compared to
the r7 370 the performance was really
quite close there's only a couple of
outliers being Far Cry Cod and total
wars DirectX 12 test aside from these
you shouldn't expect too much difference
between these two cards and the average
overall was 3.6 percent in favor of the
RX 460 overall the performance was on
par with the GTX 950 though there's
certainly some decent swings either way
turtle wars DirectX 12 test was a
massive outlier and here the 460 was 31%
faster there were some games that
favored the 950
quite considerably - including overwatch
Tomb Raider and directx12 curiously and
Far Cry the results were fairly
consistent in comparison to the r9 380
overall there's a 30% deficit to the
popular 380 and it will be interesting
to crunch the numbers and see how the
cost per frame works out compared to the
gtx 960 the RX 460 was 17% slower on
average results were also fairly
consistent here and again it'll be
interesting to see the cost per frame
data the RX 460 is shaping up as a solid
upgrade for users of the 750 Ti the
average improvement scene was 33.6% and
Vulcan allowed the 460 to shoot ahead by
a massive 62 percent I'm still really
looking forward to being able to compare
all of these cards with other games that
utilize low-level API during the game
where users a better offer the 750 Ti is
overwatch where the 460 was 5% slower so
as I talked about earlier the success of
this card will certainly come down to
pricing given what we've seen here I
expect the rx 460 to cost around 110
dollars at that price it comes at a
similar cost per frame as the RX 470 if
it does end up being the correct price
it means that when compared to the
previous generation r7 370 which I might
add was a first-generation GCM part
budget gamers are getting a slightly
more efficient graphics card and saving
40 to 50 dollars in the process overall
the radian rxt 460 is a competent 1080p
gaming solution providing you're willing
to dial down the quality settings little
in the more extreme triple-a titles what
