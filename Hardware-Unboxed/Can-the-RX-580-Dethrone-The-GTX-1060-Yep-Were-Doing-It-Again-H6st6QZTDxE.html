mega GPU showdown feels like it's been a
while since we've done one of these
probably has something to do with
Verizon anyway on the menu for you today
we have a grand total of seven games
just kidding guys 27 games and they are
all tested at the 1080p and 1440p
resolutions obviously we're pitting the
new Radeon rx 580 against the new
geforce gtx 1060 this gaming ex model
from msi that has that faster 9 gigabits
per second memory and then of course we
will also be throwing in the geforce gtx
1060 the EVGA model so that's the
standard 1060 a little bit confusing but
that's the model we've been using
previously and we've also been using the
msi gaming
x RX 480 for testing previously as well
all the results were recorded in the
past week using the latest AMD and
NVIDIA display drivers so as I said 27
games had been tested using 4 graphics
cards up to resolutions the results are
based on an average of 3 runs so that
means over 600 benchmark runs were made
in this video we'll be showing over 430
individual results last week I proposed
a list of 25 games to the harbour
unboxed patreon members and with a
little back-and-forth we ended up at 27
games those of you that were keen to see
the results of The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt
can thank scooby-doo for his input there
if you would like to become a harbour
unbox patron and support the channel we
would very much appreciate that so I'll
provide a link in the video description
anyway back to the matter at hand our
mid-range GPU battle if you have 230 to
280 dollars to spend on a new graphics
card which should you get well we're
about to go and find out before we do
though here are a few things to note the
graphics cards used for testing include
the EVGA gtx 1060 for the win + msi gtx
1060 gaming x + and from the red team we
have the msi RX for HD gaming x 8g and
the horas RX 580 extreme edition the
EVGA for the win + is very aggressively
overclocked from the factory featuring a
basically
speed of thirteen hundred and sixty two
megahertz meanwhile the MSI gaming X
plus comes clocked at fifteen hundred
and sixty nine megahertz
potentially making it four percent
slower that said the MSI model does
feature nine gigabits per second gddr5
memory which means out of the box its
memory is clocked twelve percent higher
so it will be interesting to see what if
any kind of difference this makes
finally all testing was conducted using
our tabulate core i7 seventy-seven
arcade test machine overclocked to four
point nine gigahertz I'm sure there will
be dozens upon dozens of comments asking
for a retest using a rising CPU and yes
at some point down the track we will do
exactly that for now though let's check
out the numbers we have gathered already
responsible for more dropped frames than
80 eyes catalyst drivers Grand Theft
Auto 5 is a game many of you won't let
me drop so starting things off we have
the oldest game tested and as you can
see it appears to favor the Green Team
looking at the 1440p results we see the
gtx 1060 was 17% faster than the RX 480
meanwhile the new rx 580 boosted Amy's
performance here by just 4% which meant
they were still 14% slower than the
original gtx 1060 another oldie is The
Witcher 3 Wild Hunt and again this is
back due to popular demand honestly I
will probably be testing this title till
The Witcher 4 comes out in a year or so
as time this is another title where the
Green Team has a slight advantage and
yes we did test with hair works enabled
which does give in video a slight very
slight advantage it's certainly not a
big enough the other take to the comment
section in protest never mind
too late there's already a dozen
comments isn't there anyhoo as you can
see the RX 580 was 6% faster than the RX
480 which meant it was still 6 percent
slower than the GTX 1060 s both of which
delivered the same average of 53 fps we
can't be too far away from another Tomb
Raider game either rumor has it the game
is being developed while traveling on
public transport Australia Crytek's
likely to adopt for the development of
crisis 4 we know that rise of the Tomb
Raider was developed in conjunction with
the Green Team but over time aim D has
been able to optimize their hardware for
this title quite
well as a result the RX 480 is now just
a few frames behind the gtx 1060 while
the RX 580 is able to match the new
high-speed 9g bits per second version
right now there are currently more
people playing command &amp;amp; Conquer red
alert 3 on steam than they are ashes of
the singularity a lot more this is
probably why the game has earned the
title ashes of the benchmark there could
quite possibly be more people
benchmarking the game right now than
actually playing anyway in my opinion
the game is still one of the best
examples of a well-put-together dx12
title we have though it is much more
useful for testing CPUs than it is GPUs
the RX 580 enjoys a slight performance
advantage over the gtx 1060 though for a
decks 12 title the margins are hardly
significant there are more than twice as
many people still playing 2014 Far Cry 4
when compared to the more recent primal
version even so we have stuck with the
more modern title for benchmarking the
gtx 1060 was 5 percent faster than the
RX 580 while the 9 gigabits per second
version boost the performance by further
3% some a slight advantage for end video
here Tom Clancy's the division was
tested using DirectX 12 and NVIDIA has
made up some ground with this API that
said the AMD GPUs was still able to
snatch the lead and at 1080p the RX 580
was 8% faster than the enhanced GTX 1060
moving a 1440p extended that lead and
now the RX 580 can be seen providing 11%
more performance another title which was
tested using DirectX 12 is hitman and he
things there again very much neck and
neck again in video has made great
strides recently in this tile and as a
result even with dx12 enabled the GTX
1060 was able to match the RX 580 while
managing the pull ahead of the RX 480
AMD has made up quite a lot of ground in
quantum break thanks to their own driver
development for testing we do use the
steam revision of the game at AMD now
look to be providing stronger
performance in the DirectX 11 version
even so the RX 580 was still 4% slower
than the GTX 1060 though all four GPUs
did push over 60 fps when testing at
1080p for testing over which I use the
same five-minute benchmark used to make
cpu performance so this is a 12 player
bot match the epic quality preset was
used and the render scale was manually
set to 100% here we see at 1080p the
higher clocked rx 580 makes up a good
bit of ground on the gtx 1060 while the
higher clocked 9 gigabits per second
version of the gtx 1060 made little
difference and here it is still the only
demanding game to take advantage of the
Vulcan API
no doubt much to hamdi's dismay
interestingly EVGA is for billing plus
was faster than MSI's gaming ex plus
model which utilizes the higher clocked
memory the margins weren't significant
though the EVGA version was about 4%
faster at 1080p
anyway what's key to note here is just
how much faster the radiant are x58 is
when compared to the fastest GTX 1060
tested here it was 14% faster and that's
the largest performance discrepancy seen
so far
even the RX 4 80 lays waste to both gtx
1060 models in this title
total war Warhammer has been tested
exclusively using DirectX 12 and this
appears to hand a rather large
performance advantage to the radio and
GPUs that said it is interesting to note
that even with the low-level API the AMD
GPUs do dip down to lower frame rates
despite delivering stronger average
performance honestly the experience
seemed very much the same using any one
of the 4 graphics cards tested though
looking at the figures you might assume
the GeForce graphics cards provided the
smoother experience the rx 580 was just
3% faster than the rx 480 and Mirror's
Edge catalyst when comparing the average
frame rate while the minimum was exactly
the same this then meant that it was 4%
slower than the GTX 1060 the new 9
gigabits per second version of the GTX
1060 also offered nothing new in terms
of performance for this title f1 2016
option provides competitive results and
we see this once again when comparing
the rx 580 and gtx 1060 this time the RX
580 was able to deliver 7% more
performance than the RX 480 at 1080p
which placed it on par with the gtx 1060
Deus Ex mankind divider is an AMD
sponsored title though is often the case
with time Nvidia husband
to better optimize their drivers for
improved performance the GTX 1060 is
roughly on par with the RX for 80 now
and again we see that the 9g bits per
second model has nothing extra to add as
a result the RX 580 enjoyed a reasonably
comfortable wing here leading the GTX
1060 by 9% margin if there's one thing
that gets nerds rolled up more than
thermal paste application it's testing
games that support DirectX 12 using dx11
well aware of the risks this is exactly
what we've done when testing battlefield
1 the dx12 performance is still a little
off in this title it's a bit strange and
we often see lower minimums with the
radio and graphics cards so again we are
sticking with dx11 for this title here
we see that the RX 480 and gtx 1060 are
pretty well even at both resolutions the
RX 580 though is still able to pull
ahead thanks to a 6% performance
advantage hitting 91 FPS on average at
TP as they so often are the mafia 3
numbers are interesting the Radeon GPUs
are clearly faster at 1080p while oddly
they struggle to match the GTX 1060 at
1440p focusing on the 1080p numbers we
see at the RX 480 is 10% faster the GTX
1060 while the rx 580 is 15% faster so a
clear win frame D here then at least
when looking at the 1080p resolution any
way géza for 4 might be a DirectX 12
title but it was also sponsored by
Nvidia so take this dx12 performance
with a grain of salt typically you would
expect the Radeon GPUs to perform well
in a dx12 tile but here we see the rx
580 trailing the GTX 1060 by 13% margin
once again though we find the upgraded
memory doesn't help the GTX 1060 out
titanfall 2 has always played better on
hardware from the red team though to be
fair this game isn't terribly demanding
and plays well I'm pretty much anything
that set at 1080p BRX 580 was 12% faster
than the enhanced GTX 1060
we also saw a 7% increase over the older
rx 480 in this title
civilization 6 is a lot like ashes of
the singularity in the sense that it
mostly tests CPU performance as you can
see we are mostly CPU limited at 1080p
once we move to 1440p though the GPU
starts to be
the performance limiting component and
here we see the RX 580 is able to
deliver 9% more performance than the GTX
1060 AMD did a great job of optimizing
their software for call of duty infinite
warfare and have led in video in this
title from day one typically this is a
hugely popular series and therefore a
big win for AMD
of course knowing AMD's like it
shouldn't be a surprise at this
installment of the Call of Duty series
tanked with an all-time peak of just
15,000 plays that's less than half the
already underwhelming figure from the
previous title black ops 2 for example
peaked at over 70,000 concurrent players
anyway Call of Duty shortcomings aside
the rx 580 does very well here providing
17% more performance than the GTX 1060
that said the RX 580 was just 5% faster
than the RX 480
the Radeon rx 580 was around 13% slower
than the GTX 1060 and dishonored - in
fact the rx 580 only just broke the 60
FPS barrier at 1080p while the GTX 1060
only dipped to 55 FPS so a clear win for
the NVIDIA GPUs here then watchdogs - is
the third triple-a title released last
November that we test with and it's
certainly one of the most demanding on
system resources the rx 580 was just 8%
sold in the GTX 1060 and once again it
did only offer very mild gains over the
R X 480 around 5% more frames the rx 580
ensures that you'll have the crap scared
out of you at the highest possible frame
rates of any mid-range graphics card in
Resident Evil 7 here at 1080p the 580
was good for an average of a hundred and
seven FPS though that did make it just
4% faster than the four OD more
importantly though the rx 580 was 15%
faster in the GTX 1060 and this allowed
for a smoother experience at 1440p the
honorable thing to do he was enable a
fair fight and this is exactly what for
honor does performance was very much the
same across all four GPUs tested so not
much else to say here visually the game
was maxed out so it was nice to see over
60 FPS at all times when playing at
1080p released in March 2017 Tom
Clancy's Ghost Recon wildlands is a very
demanding open-world title that said at
1080p we saw a very respectable frame
rats using the very high quality preset
once again the rx 580 was just a few
frames faster than the RX 480
here we see a 5% bump for what is
essentially a mild factory overclock the
nine cubits per second gtx 1060 was even
more underwhelming though the standard
gtx 1060 was still ever the best the RX
580 in this title that said the margins
were slim at 1080p while there was
nothing separating them at 1440p also
released in march we have Mass Effect
Andromeda and like ferrata this title
provides very competitive results
performance at 1080p using the ultra
quality preset was good though the game
did feel a bit laggy at 1440p on all the
graphics cards tested finally the last
game tested is also the most recently
added to our battery at benchmarks
Warhammer dawn of War 3 this game was
tested with the latest AMD display
driver which advertised a 7% performance
boost for the rx 580 the Radeon GPUs
were most impressive when looking at the
minimum frame rate as the rx 580 was 13%
faster than the GTX 1060 previously we
saw and configured with the R X 480 that
our system consumed around 10 percent
more power than the same system can
figure with the gtx 1060 here we see an
11% increase that figure is increased by
a further 10% with the rx 580 which
pushed total system consumption of 344
watts this meant that the total system
consumption was 22% higher with the
Auris rx 580 that I was with the EVGA
for the win plus with peak consumption
still well under 400 watts for a system
running a 77 or okay at 4.9 gigahertz
the rx 580 is hardly a power-hungry
beast still for those seeking maximum
efficiency the GTX 1060 is clearly the
better option here right then that's the
easy bit taken care of so I'm going to
pick a winner actually maybe I'll just
in the video there and let you guys
fight it out in the comments now what
the hell were you guys are going to do
that anyway so I might as well give you
Steve's to sense first let's see how
they compare when averaging the data
across all 27 games tested here we see
that overall the 9 gigabits per second
gaming x+ model was no faster than the
EVGA for the win plus the very model
we've been using for LR GTX 1060 testing
this means overall the our X 480 was
just too
half percent slower than the GTX 1060 at
1080p or two FPS so a negligible
difference then the RX 580 booster
performance by just 5% which made it
just 2 FPS faster than gtx 1060 or again
two and a half percent
so overall the RX 580 was fast in the
gtx 1060 albeit by an insignificant
margin if we remove the DirectX 11
titles and focus solely on those that
support low-level api s we see the GTX
1016 RX 480 are roughly on par with one
another that said the RX 580 is now 6
percent faster than GTX 1060 not a huge
margin by any means but still a clue in
for the red team in those more modern
titles now let's take a closer look at
where the big wins and losses were had
for each team right away it's
interesting to note that ami took the
lead in the majority of the games tested
15 - in videos 11 while they drew in
just a single title that said margins
were extremely slim and overwatch for
honor and f1 2016 the RX 580 was faster
by a 10% margin or greater in total or
warhammer titanfall 2 muffy 3 Resident
Evil 7 Call of Duty infinite warfare and
doom meanwhile it was 10% slower in just
three titles being dishonored to Gears
of War 4 and Grand Theft Auto 5 so in
terms of performance they are very
similar that said out of the box the RX
580 is slightly faster though of course
it uses quite a bit more power as well
if you were to base this comparison on
the suggested retail prices the RX 580
seems like the obvious choice the MSRP
has been set at 230 dollars u.s. for the
8 gigabyte model while the gtx 1060
costs 250 dollars for the base model and
there is no MSRP for the nine gigabits
per second models but they do tend to be
more expensive
currently most rx 580 models are priced
at $250 us so we really need to see a
price correction here that said there is
a power color red dragon model selling
for $200
but the gigabyte RS model we checked out
currently costs $280 which is a bit rich
in my opinion meanwhile the gtx 1060
models also started around $230 though
again most are priced around 250 dollars
the EVGA for the win + model that we use
for testing all
so costs $280 while the new nine
gigabits per second model from MSI cost
an eye-watering
$290 u.s. so again you really could go
either way it really comes down to the
games you play and the features you want
to take advantage of in this mid-range
affordable market segment AMD's freesync
which is now very widely supported is a
huge selling point AMD has also been
making a heap of noise in regards to
their radio and chill feature and while
it does seem to work quite well I have
to admit this is a feature I would never
enable or use on my own personal gaming
rig so aim D probably offers better
features of this price point namely
their free sync but it doesn't exactly
seal the deal it's interesting to look
back at the RX 4 80 versus gtx 1060
battle and see how things have evolved
our day 1 GeForce GTX 1060 coverage
compared these mid-range GPUs and 28
games back in July 2016 and at the time
the GTX 1060 dominated winning it over
85% of the titles tested to beat the rx
480 by a convincing 12% margin
however just five months later we did
retest with 19 games some of which were
newly-released titles at the time along
with aimed is Crimson relive drivers the
result did see AMD close the margin
significantly and now the GTX 1060 was
just 1% faster than the RX 480
in other words performance was much the
same on either GPU then fast forward
another 5 months which brings us to
today we have more new games new drivers
and even you graphics cards well
refreshed graphics cards as you just saw
the GTX 1060 is still a fraction fast in
the RX 480
but the new overclocked 580 model has
enough in the tank to get one up on the
GeForce graphics card for me efficiency
really is important and this is why I've
been a huge fan of invidious Pascal
architecture that said this latest
comparison I have found myself drawn
more towards the rx 580 and I think this
is the card I would be picking up if I
was in the market for a sub $300 us
mid-range graphics card the fact that it
was faster in the majority games tested
and the widespread availability of
really good freesync monitors has pushed
me in favor of the red team of course
there really is no wrong choice here
and I could have easily justified
picking up the GTX 1060
instead needless to say though the
competition is extremely fierce in the
sub $300 GPU market well that's it for
this one I picked up the RX 580 so time
