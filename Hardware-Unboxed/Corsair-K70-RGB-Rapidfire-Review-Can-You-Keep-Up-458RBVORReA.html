completely new cherry MX trick up its
sleeve similar to last year's strafe
silent corsair continues as the
exclusive deal with cherry to bring you
the newest and switch technology this
time the k7 is sporting the new chair
max speed RGB an iteration of their
bread switch that features a much
reduced actuation distance and earns the
keyboard the rapid-fire name design-wise
the k70 RGB rapid-fire is familiar it
has the brushed aluminium backing plate
media controls and volume wheel and
dedicated brightness and windows lock
key that you might recognize from
previous models the keys are unverified
edges of the keyboard and stay true to a
pretty standard layout thankfully the
USB pass-through port makes your return
after having been featured on the
original k70 but strangely removed from
the k70 RGB i'm a big fan of these
although i'm looking forward to when USB
3 or even 3.1 ports start to make an
appearance on their gaming keyboards
next to this port is a switch that
toggles the polling rate and also make
sure that your keyboard be compatible
with all viruses the lighting on the new
k70 is possibly the best I've seen with
these new RGB switches the characters on
the keys are both closer to the LED and
they're also larger giving a brighter
face up appearance the glow on the
aluminium backing plate also looks great
so those that love their RGB lighting it
going to be more than happy corsair has
again kindly included textured key caps
to both FPS and mobile gamers as well as
the key remover tool and the space bar
is textured out of the box which
honestly I find a little strange it was
the same back on the strafe models too
and it's such a commonly used key it
would have been nice to see coarser
include an optional smooth space bar the
large wrist rest is a solid inclusion
from Corsair and I was very pleased to
see it not that I ever would remove it
but the rest is detachable and I suppose
when you're traveling it would
definitely make it easier to pack away
with the wrist rest attached anyone that
prefers not to use it also as the option
to live in the box to something I
haven't seen before is the dual set of
legs underneath the keyboard we used to
seeing them at the back to tilt the
keyboard forward and the rapid-fire does
so but then there's also a small set at
the front which props the front end up
to make the keys face up with a
completely horizontal angle I tried
using the keyboard like this it's not
for me but I'll never complain about
additional options
now let's take a look at these switches
the cherry MX speed switches our course
our exclusive for six months time so you
won't see them on any other brand
keyboards as mentioned these speed
switches are essentially a cherry MX red
switch with the same 45 gram actuation
force but the actuation point is reduced
from two millimeters to just one point
two millimeters on the new switch this
beats out logitech's roma g switches
which actuated one point five
millimeters let me tell you they feel
pretty good it's kind of funny seeing
the letters pop up slightly faster as I
tired and I hope that it's not just a
placebo effect in my head I know that
they literally are popping up faster but
I wonder if it's actually an amount of
time that's perceptible to the human eye
either way I know they're fast and
faster than any other switch out there
however I didn't find the extra speed
elevated me to Grand Master League and
starcraft 2 unfortunately so don't get
too excited the k70 rapid fire employees
Corsairs utility engine software or c ue
within this software you can create and
assign different profiles configure
macro is to any key customize the
lighting as you please or select from
pre-designed profiles and even link the
profiles you create two different
applications or games all this is pretty
standard stuff that we basically expect
as a minimum from gaming keyboard
manufacturers but a cool actually the
Corsair has included is the RGB profile
community where users can create and
upload their special rgv creations for
the rest of the world to enjoy overall
the k70 RGB rapid-fire is a really great
mechanical keyboard I was really pleased
to see the return of the USB
pass-through and the large detachable
wrist rest is solid the cherry MX speeds
which is a very cool and it does feel
very fast to use although you want to be
a fan of eternia max Reds are ready to
really enjoy this keyboard I said the
lighting on the strafe may have been the
best I'd seen but now the k70 really
takes the cake it's so vivid and bright
and I really look forward to seeing what
the RGB profile community can produce
the k70 RGB rapid fire comes in at a
high-end but reasonable price point of
170 US dollars or wallet burning 20 and
50 australian dollars but we're used to
that right mates these are the price
points it basically all flagship
mechanical keyboards these days and
honestly this rapid fire iteration of
your k70 might be one of the best around
is this a gaming keyboard you'll be
considering let me know in the comments
and if you want to check prices then
