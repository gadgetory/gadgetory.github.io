are checking out as rocks need s me a
300 it's a teeny tiny PC that finally
takes advantage of aim D rising
processors almost every custom designed
mini PC that we've seen today uses Intel
processors and while Intel CPUs are very
good they aren't the best choice for
this kind of system at least if you want
a game or do any kind of 3d work for
that aim DS rise and AP users really are
unrivaled so after dozens upon dozens of
Intel based B boxes and desk mini pcs
asrock has finally developed an AMD am 4
socket mini PC to take advantage of
those ray from rich EP use does also
support those Bristol Ridge AP use but
yeah you guys probably know my opinion
on those that means ideally you will
want to throw in a risin 322 energy or
risin 5 2400 G they're pretty much your
only options now there are some OEMs and
whatnot but they're the two main CPUs
you'll want and since their release it
was about twelve months ago now I've
been recommending the 22 energy as the
ultimate bang for your buck option
however in that time is n based quote
cause lacking SMT support have started
to struggle a bit in the latest games we
saw it recently in almost every title
the 2400 G was a good bit faster in the
2200 G but with the 2200 G previously
priced 70 dollars lower a little over
40% less it was hard to pass up today
though the 20/20 is just $40 cheaper and
that's a 30% saving making it a bit less
enticing in my opinion for $135 us the
horizon 520 400 G is a cracking good
processor and surely only those not in
the know would buy a core i3 8100 for a
hundred and fifty dollars for those of
you interested I will revisit the 2400 G
soon and a detailed benchmark video but
for now I just want to see how it
performs in the new des Mini a 300 as
this really is the best AP you can put
inside of this compact 1.9 liter
bare-bones system so the desk Mini a 300
costs a very reasonable 150 dollars us
and that investment you get a custom
case this little guy here
it measures 155 millimetres wide 155
millimetres deep and it is 80
millimeters tall it is capable of
housing two two and a half inch storage
devices they go on the underside of the
motherboard here and you can fit CPU
coolers as tall as forty six millimeters
it does limit you somewhat but there is
an optional cooler that you can get for
this if you're struggling to find
options but I'll talk more about that in
a moment and then inside we will find
actually where is a screwdriver before I
start talking about the inside of the
system we might as well have a look at
the inside of the system that
screwdriver of course is the wrong one
let's try this one yeah we go we run
till we know okay so what was I saying
inside we have I'll just undo this here
this is the front I owe a little
motherboard I've obviously got the
memory and the CPU cooler installed at
this point because I have been testing
with it but inside you will find the
little a 300 M STX motherboard and this
little guy measures 147 by 140
millimeters as you might expect for such
a tiny motherboard it's not exactly
brimming with features but you do get
all the essentials the front IO includes
a USB 3.1 gen2 on type C port along with
a type-a port and then around the back
there's an additional two USB ports a
3.1 gen one type A and a 2.0 type a
onboard there's also a basic realtek
audio and gigabit network solution and
then there are three m2 ports now the
two of these for SSDs there's one on the
back side of the board you will have to
physically remove the board from the
case to access that one then the one on
the top side of the board you can access
that very easily and then above that
there is a third m3 port and that is for
a Wi-Fi module then finally there are
two laptops style memory dim supporting
up to ddr4 29:33 with Rison AP use the
display outputs include a single HDMI a
single DisplayPort and a legacy VGA port
and it's also possible to use all three
simultaneously for a triple monitor
configuration now there are two optional
items one is a very basic
which did come with our sample and the
other is an m2 Wi-Fi kit which didn't
come with our sample there is a listing
over on Newegg right now which doesn't
include the cooler but it does come with
the Intel AC 3168 Wi-Fi kit for just one
hundred and fifty dollars so that really
is a great option there after all you
can just use the Wraith stealth cooler
that came with your eyes an APU though
be aware you will have to remove the fan
shroud just the top cover with the AMD
logo on it this reduces the coolers
height by a few millimeters which is
enough to fit it inside the a300 but
this has no impact on cooling
performance and I tested this previously
using the in wind Chopin then powering
the DES mini a 300 is an included 120
watt power brick it's a 19 volts 6.32
out version and there's just enough
Headroom for using something like the
risin 5 2400 G okay so that's the
barebone what you need to bring to the
table is a CPU some memory and well some
form of storage for the CPU it's really
either the 22 energy or 2400 G obviously
we're testing with the 2400 G and yes
some storage so for the storage I
recommend using the m2 slot as your sort
of primary boot drive and that frees up
the 2 and a half inch drive bays on the
back side for either some bigger SSDs or
mechanical drives so for m2 storage
obviously there's just endless options
this isn't really a guide as to what you
should use but something like the WD
blue 500 gigabyte that cost just 68
dollars u.s. that's a great option nice
and affordable all those the Plextor
I saw the s2 G on new egg a 512 gigabyte
SSD that was just $55 either of those
will work well you really can't go too
wrong for this kind of system you don't
need some sort of really high speed SSD
any of those should be more than
sufficient so with SSD prices for your
half terabyte drives 500 gigabyte with
them well under $100 u.s. I don't think
you need to bother with the 240 250 60
gigabyte models anymore but if you only
want to spend like $35 then they are an
option but I'll leave that to you guys
to decide what stories you want and then
of course once you've got your SSD in
your m2 you can flip it over you have
two two and a half inch drive bays here
again you can populate those with larger
mechanical hard drives whether they're
one or two terabytes or you can put in
some additional SSDs as well I suppose
one or two terabyte SSDs they'd be
spending a bit of money to do that
but the choice is yours there are
options any way to expand the storage
I'll talk more about the hardware
configurations towards the end of the
video and some us various alternatives
to this little mini PC know so we'll
discuss all of that in the conclusion
for now though I just want to see what
kind of performance you can get from the
desk mini a300 of course we have tested
the risin AP use the 2020 and 2400 G
quite extensively haven't done any
updated testing so perhaps I'll do some
more in-depth testing with the 2400 G
and 2020 G in a later video for this one
I just want to delve into a bit of
gaming show you some actual gameplay
footage so you get a good idea of what
you're in for with this thing and again
no application testing because none of
that's really changed from my day 1
review that I did about a year ago now
so if you want to know how performs in a
whole heap of applications then go back
and see our 20 plus minute long review
covering the 20 20 G and 20 400 G in
depth the only other thing I haven't
talked about is memory obviously you can
use whatever so did memory you would
like but for testing I'm using g.skill
ripjaws ddr4 21 33 CL 15 memory it's a
16 gigabyte kit the reason I've used
that memory is quite simple it's very
cheap it was actually the cheapest
memory I could find and it worked out to
be about $80 u.s. there are ddr4 3200
memory kits but they cost upwards of a
hundred and thirty dollars u.s. so about
what you'd spend for the 2400 G probably
not we're spending that much on memory
for this little build but okay you can
do yourself you're wrong because it will
offer a nice performance boost for that
integrated vaguer 11 GPU of course you
can overclock the memory and that's what
I've done in this video so we've gone
from 21 33 up to 29 33 of course setting
the frequency to 29 33 did reduce the
timings from cell 15
to cell 16 and then the following timers
were 21 21 49 you could no doubt
manually tune those timings for even
better performance
do that but I wanted to test something
that was closer to the out-of-the-box
experience because I'm sure not all of
you guys are gonna delve into memory
timings and tune those all up and then
getting low latency higher frequency
memory is extremely expensive I can't
remember the exact prices but it was
north of like $180 u.s. so yeah that
means we're gonna use g.skill Ripjaws
ddr4 2133 and overclock it to 2933 with
lucid timings so all that other way I
think it's time to see how this thing
gets on first up we have apex legends
and here I was forced down to the 720p
resolution with the lowest possible
quality settings for playable
performance at times the performance was
a bit deceiving though as frame rates
went over 100 FPS but they would still
often dip down to around half that still
overall we were looking at around 60 to
70 fps and performance was very
consistent for the most part bumping the
resolution up to nine her P was still
playable but here the frame dips were
more noticeable beyond that though the
game just wasn't playable moving on we
have battlefield 5 and again I was
forced down to the 720p resolution in
search of 60fps and this is the kind of
frame 8 that's really required if you
hope to rack up a few kills and the
multiplayer modes with the low quality
preset enabled we typically saw around
60fps with dips into the 50s but overall
quite a smooth and enjoyable experience
certainly playable by entry level PC
standards when testing potato-like
gaming hardware you've always could have
included csgo and for this one I was
able to test that tell your pay using
the higher quality visuals though it's
probably not saying too much frame rates
did dip down into the 40's at times but
we're often up around 60 fps needless to
say with a few quality tweaks
maintaining over 60 FPS at all times
really won't be an issue
then for Far Cry new dawn I used the
normal quality preset which is quite
respectable though I did so at 720p here
frame rates fluctuated between 35 and 45
fps there were at times quite serious
frame stutters which did detract from
the gameplay but the game was still
playable and I guess you've sort of got
to expect that kind of thing when you're
gaming on you to graded graphics next
that we have fortnight and for this one
I went with the
quality settings at 904 at least 75 FPS
though most of the time we were looking
more at 90 to 100 FPS which sounds
really great sadly though the experience
was spoilt somewhat by fairly regular
frame stuttering again it was playable
depending on your standards I guess but
had frame rates been smoother the
experience would have been great on this
little PC now one of the best
experiences I had was with Rainbow six
siege using the lowest quality preset
the resolution was set to 9 MP though
with taa a 50% render scale is set still
the game looked very good and played
buttery smooth I couldn't blame any
missed shots on frame stutter for this
one framerate stayed above 60 FPS at all
times and generally hovered around 80
fps again it was a great experience and
a perfect example of how much fun can be
had with this compact system finally I
fired up rocket League enabled the
performance preset at 1080p and this
generally saw a frame rates hover
between 70 and 80 FPS frame rates were
consistent allowing for smooth highly
playable performance so as we saw with
csgo it is possible to play these less
demanding titles but still very popular
titles at very respectable quality
settings now as mentioned earlier the
desk mini a 300 it does come with a 120
watt power brick 120 watt power supply
it is this thing right here and with the
2400 G providing you don't do any
serious overclocking perhaps any
overclocking at all you can get away
with this 120 watt power but obviously
this is designed to work with the 2400 G
but not sure how much testing asrock did
with a lot of the hardware being
overclocked such as the CPU and the eye
GPU I think there you'd probably be
limited by thermals anyway so probably a
bit of a non-issue with the 2500 G
unless you can get some big huge copper
cooler in there but that'd probably cost
more than the case and the processor and
all that so again probably not worth
doing anyway in its stock configuration
which is what we use for testing the
2400 G with a pair of one terabyte
mechanical hard drives and then a 2
terabyte SSD that we use for all our
testing the a300 consumed a do 2 watts
in our blender stress test that's not
too bad that's obviously well under the
120
what rated capacity of this power brick
however when gaming such as battlefield
5 multiplayer which is quite taxing on
the CPU and obviously very taxing on the
integrated graphics we did see the
wattage climb as high as 102 watts so
not a great deal of headroom there so
like I said I probably wouldn't
recommend overclocking this or making
you any more power-hungry than it
already is obviously it's very efficient
102 watts for the entire system while
playing a game is exceptionally low but
when you've got to have just 120 watt
power brick here you don't want to go
too much higher than that moving on
let's look at operating temperatures
using the optional cooler the risin 5
2400 G hits 78 degrees under load now
blender stress test but idled at just 33
degrees this is a reasonable operating
temperature and surprising this little
cooler didn't make that much noise
replacing the base cooler with the race
stealth I only dropped the low
temperature by 4 degrees though the desk
mini a 300 was basically silent now so
if you have a stealth cooler and you're
happy to take off the top cover then I
recommend using it in the a300 as rocks
new desk mini a 300 is really everything
I hoped it would be and I'm glad they
finally released a mini PC that supports
Raven Ridge ap use been begging for one
of those ever since AMD release them
about a year ago now of course the
gaming performance won't blow your socks
off but you can at least play games in
some capacity so that's a pretty big win
there
it really wasn't possible with any of
the Intel CPUs you were really limited
to flash base games there so yeah this
is a significant upgrade in that respect
so if you're after a compact gaming rig
and you don't want to buy a console for
whatever reason perhaps you want a fully
functioning PC so you can do things like
video editing or whatever else it is
that you may do with a fully functioning
PC then I feel like the a300 fits the
bill nicely of course it is a very niche
product you have to be in the market for
an extremely small PC that can handle
some light 3d work I have to say though
if you just after a cost-effective
gaming rig then this really isn't it and
that's despite being one of the cheapest
options available the issue here being
the a300 inability to support a discreet
graphics card
making your only upgrade option a Zen -
based APU alternatively you could build
your own rising 5 2400 G system and a
much larger micro ATX case for a few
dollars more and this gives you the
ability to snap up something like a
Radeon rx 560 or perhaps even one of
those insanely cheap rx 570 models and
this 100 to 150 dollar discrete graphics
card upgrade will improve performance
tenfold or of course for a slight price
premium it's also possible to build a
mini ITX system it won't be nearly as
small as the a320 but it'll still be
very small and again it will have the
ability to support a discreet graphics
card so this means the desk mini a300 is
an extremely niche product but I doubt
that's going to surprise to many of you
in the end if you seek a super compact
PC capable of a little bit of casual
gaming and whatnot then there really is
no better option than as rocks mini desk
mini 8300 and it really is very mini
he's a he's a gtx 1660 for example the
MSI gaming X model and you sure as hell
aren't fitting that in there but you
that gives you an idea of just how small
this thing is if it wasn't obvious
already anyway I think that she'll do it
