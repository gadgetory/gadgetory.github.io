corner interesting week of news we've
just had there's some stuff on CPUs and
stuff on GPUs and a few other cool
developments in the tech industry so
we'll get to all of that in a moment
firstly though I just wanted to give you
guys a bit of an update on Metro Exodus
and its implementation of DL SS in our
video discussing do SS in battlefield 5
we mentioned that we didn't want to test
Metro just yet because the developers
weren't happy with the implementation
well it looks like we made the right
choice because a patch has launched
which drastically improves the image
quality of DL ss in the game we're still
exploring how DL SS impacts the game so
you'll have to wait until probably next
week for a more in-depth exploration but
my early impressions are the
implementation is much better than
battlefield 5 there isn't as much of a
blur filter from what I've seen it's it
is a night and day difference pre and
post patch and I definitely think gamers
will be more happy with the improvements
in this latest patch than than what they
were getting previously however and I do
want to stress this is very early on
into our look into this deal ss does
still seem to be performing around the
same level as rendering the game at 1800
P and I should note here the game is
properly rendering at 1800 P in this
comparison using a custom resolution not
using the in-game shading rate option
comparing the two images DL SS appears
to be superior in some areas weaker in
other areas and almost identical in many
areas which is very similar to our
initial investigation way back in
September of last year with the
infiltrated demo performance of 4k DL SS
and 1800 P rendering is nearly identical
and the native 4k images of course
superior overall with worst performance
I've also noticed a few strange
artifacts with the DL SS image aliased
shimmering is more apparent than either
the native 4k or 1800 P presentations
and some of the final detail appears to
have been reconstructed strangely is
maybe the best way to put it
usually you get this sort of streaky
effect from post-processing noise
reduction and sharpening it's present in
some Samsung smartphone camera photos
for example so I have to explore that
further and see whether it's in
other sections of the game not going to
make any conclusions about DL SS in this
game just yet I haven't seen enough data
yet to make a definitive statement for
example I want to explore how 1,800 P
plus a crude sharpening filter compares
but I am interested to hear the thoughts
of you guys on this in the comments boy
it is looking a lot more promising than
battlefield 5 and I just wanted to
present some early data here because it
may be a little while before we can get
to our full in-depth look at this and I
want you guys to know that we are taking
a look at DSS in Metro Exodus with the
latest update probably as we speak this
fear will be will be published and I'll
be back working on that into the other
news topics now a new series of Intel
Pentium and Celeron processors has been
listed at a collection of European
retailers and is scheduled for release
in early March the new lineup comprises
of four Pentium gold processors with two
cores and four threads along with three
- core to thread Celeron chips
we're not sure in the architecture but
you'd assume it to be some skylight
derivative probably coffee like though
hopefully it's coffee like refresh the
key new chip here is the Pentium Gold
g56 20 which is the first Pentium CPU to
hit four gigahertz and that's the
general clock speed because Pentium quad
CPUs do not have turbo functionality
aside from the name and clock speed not
a lot else has been confirmed however
this does appear to be just a simple
hundred megahertz clock speed boost to
the existing coffee HD 5600 which would
suggest we asked are looking at a 54
watt TDP and 4 megabytes of level 3
cache the G 5600 has a recommended price
around 86 US dollars though due to stock
shortages it is over 150 bucks right now
perhaps the G 56:20 will come in by $100
that would be pretty nice all the other
chips appear to be 100 megahertz clock
speed boosts on their predecessors the G
54 20 is 3.8 gigahertz for example
compared to 3.7 gigahertz for the G 5400
the G 5600 T's 3.3 gigahertz up from 3.2
gigahertz with the G 5500 T and so on
same deal with the seller on stack each
of those chips gets a 100 megahertz
increase no official word from Intel on
these CPUs yet and I do occupy that
budget market that not a lot of people
talk about but even a 100 megahertz
boost between the same price bracket
could be handy especially if these new
CPUs launched at decent prices and can
actually be found in stock in
has also been a bit of a launching spree
quietly releasing two new MX series GPS
for laptops the MX 250 and mx2 30 these
GPUs tend to be the go-to discreet
options for high-end thinner light
systems as well as thicker entry-level
products unfortunately we're really not
getting a ton of details here in fact we
really have no information on these
chips at all
however expectation is these are not
truing based products despite twin
series naming instants highly likely
they're still using GP 108 Pascal
silicon the MX 250 could be a rebranded
MX 150 it could be faster we just don't
know right now what I am hoping is the
case is that Nvidia uses this
opportunity to make the MX 250 and
equivalent to the fully fledged 25 watt
MX 150 while the down clocked 10 watt 1
de 12 billion of the MX 150 becomes the
MX 230 that would remove a lot of
confusion in the market between these
two parts but again nothing's being
confirmed the one bit of information we
do know is these chips use gddr5 memory
and have GPU boost 3.0 technology but as
it really will have to wait for actual
implementations to learn more TSM sees
chemical contamination issue at Feb 14 B
was more serious than the company first
anticipated after full analysis TMC now
expects the incident to cause a 550
million dollar of reduction in revenue
for the first quarter which is a massive
chunk of cash to lose from a photoresist
chemical contamination the problem
damaged thousands of 12 nanometer and 16
nanometer wafers impacting a number of
customers believed to be including
Nvidia mediatek and Huawei however there
hasn't been an official confirmation on
how many wafers were damaged or which
companies will be impacted that said if
550 million dollars worth of wafers had
to be scrapped you know it was a pretty
serious amount of wafers however the
impact of TSMC won't be an entire 550
million dollars because the damaged
chips will still be manufactured
correctly at a later date there will of
course be a cost associated with having
to throw out wafers extra manufacturing
time to make new ones and so on but some
of this lost revenue should be recovered
in the next quarter when the damaged
wafers of RAM made to prevent this issue
from occurring in the future tsmc will
improve the inspection of incoming
chemicals and water
Intel has quietly detailed their
upcoming lineup of ninth generation
h-series processes for laptops
in a document detailing several metrics
for compliance reasons
intel has revealed 6/9 gen8 models
ranging from the court i $9.99 a thk to
the core i5 9300 h at the top end we're
seeing eight core CPUs hid laptops for
the first time all of the H series core
oh nine and cry seven models packet
eight course the cry nines having 16
threads and the cry servants just eight
threads exactly like the desktop CPUs
then the two core i5 models are both
four core eight thread parts with no six
core offerings in the lineup for other
specifications we only have level three
cache and boost clocks right now the I
$9.99 a thk clocks up to five gigahertz
same as the 9900 K then there's the iron
998 a th and up to 4 point 8 gigahertz
the core i7 9850 H is up to four point
six Hertz the i7 9750 H is up to four
point five degree Hertz then only 400 H
and 9300 H sit at four point three
gigahertz and 4.1 gigahertz respectively
no Teddy peds are listed previously
Intel's used 45 watts for these chips
but that might have to increase
depending on the base clock compared to
coffee like parts it looks like we're
getting an increase to both maximum
clock speeds and cores at least for the
higher-end models the popular core i7
8750 X for example is a 6 chord 12
thread part with a 2.2 gigahertz base
and 4.1 gigahertz maximum turbo clock de
Croy 797 50 H is coming in at 8 cores
and 8 threads with maximum 4.5 gigahertz
turbo if Intel sticks with a 45 watt TDP
base clocks might need to be below 2.0 D
Hertz for these parts until it's
apparently on track to release these
processes officially in the second
quarter of 2019 so will be a few months
before they are ready for use in laptops
the seuss ROG Dominus extreme that
insane new LGA 3647 motherboard for the
Intel Xeon w30 175 X processor has a
price tag of eighteen hundred US dollars
that brings the total cost for just the
basics of a 0w system absolutely five
thousand dollars when you factor in the
cost of the three thousand dollar CPU
itself certainly will be very expensive
to build workstations based on this
platform what did you get the 1,800 us
well lots of power connectors lots of
DIMM slots lots of PCI Express 16 time
slots and an enormous 32 phase vrm to
power that CPU both stock and
overclocked but you will still have to
pay eight dollars in shipping to get it
if there's anything disappointing about
Intel Xeon debut lineup is the shipping
costs on an $1,800 motherboard core says
new and Dominator platinum RGB memory is
the first to use the company's new
Catholics LEDs which we talked about
news corner a while ago these new LEDs
are small brighter and more power
efficient than the standard SMD LEDs the
company was previously using this will
allow for high-resolution LED strips or
a similar led configuration to existing
designs that's brighter and more
efficient each dominator Platinum RGB
module has 12 capital X LEDs inside and
according to PC perspective in their
testing they found the new LED designed
to be brighter than what came before
while the LED effect resolution also
looks pretty impressive kids are
available in the usual specifications
for corsair dominator memory with the
focus on the higher end as this is a
premium product I'm finishing off this
one today with a rumor relating to the
geforce gtx 1650 according to video
cards they've been able to confirm the
existence of this GPU stating it will
likely use a smaller GPU than the tu1
1:6 fan in the upcoming gtx 1660 TI no
one else is known other than video card
Stanny will launch in late march
following the launch of the gtx 1616 on
TI immoral and that's it for this week's
news corner I've got to get back to the
testing there is so much stuff to cover
right now we're very busy here at
hardware our box tomorrow's video should
be particularly interesting to GPU fans
but can't really say any more at the
moment
