today we're taking a close look at MSI's
flagship g-force r-tx 2060 graphics card
the gaming Z in addition to the gaming
Zed they've also got the Ventus and
arrow ATX the Ventus is basically for
everyone who couldn't pony up the extra
dollar hoodoos for the gaming Zed and
the Aero ITX is for those that couldn't
afford the rest of their case since we
do have a normal-sized PC case and
saving $30 doesn't really interest us
the gaming Zed it is now as a premium RT
X 2060 model it comes in at $390 us the
same price as the gigabyte gaming OC pro
that we used for testing in our initial
r-tx 2016 coverage
so at a little over 10 percent more
expensive than your run-of-the-mill RT X
2060 what is so special about the gaming
Zed well for one it has a fat cooler
it's actually well it's probably best
described as a stocky cooler yeah this
is without question the shortest high
and our Tech's 2060 graphics card out
there but at 52 millimeters wide I
wouldn't call it compact it's a triple
slot card so yeah its stocky
it's very stocky the gaming Zed measures
just 247 millimeters long and sure that
makes it a little longer than the
foundation model but it is shorter than
other custom aib models at least in his
price range such as gigabytes gaming OC
pro which does measure two hundred and
eighty millimeters long anyway point is
it's not that long but it is very wide
so bit of an interesting choice there
from MSI it has to be said the card
weighs in at 947 grams which is quite
heavy and 508 grams of that weight is
accounted for by the cooler the
black-and-gray fan shroud looks quite
good
it's made from plastic but still looks
very good and there's a few RGB
highlights here and there for those of
you who like a little bling embedded in
the shroud or two 85 millimeter stalks
3.0 fans which remain inactive until the
card or the GPU reaches and exceeds 60
degrees under the fan shroud we find two
aluminium fin stacks one features a
nickel plated copper base plate
two six millimeter pipes and then the
second bank of fins features four heat
pipes now the cooler on this card is
used solely to cool that tu 106 GPU the
GDD are six memory and vram feature
their own heat spreaders so this means
the six one-gigabyte GDD are six modules
are covered by a black aluminium heat
spreader that weighs just 44 grams then
we have an even smaller heat spreader
over the verum it weighs just 27 grams
so it will be very interesting to see
just how hot the vrm and GDD are six
memory get when gaming feeding power
into the card is a single eight pin PCIe
power connector which is more than
sufficient and on the backside of the
card we have a fancy-looking backplate
that stretches the entire length of the
PCB and the backplate itself weighs just
80 grams it's also insulated on the
backside and doesn't feature any kind of
thermal pads to remove heat that's built
up on the rear side of the PCB around at
the i/o panel there's three display
ports and a single HDMI port pretty
typical loadout for RTX 2060 graphics
card has to be said overall the gaming Z
looks pretty good but now it's time to
find out if it really is any good so
let's throw in the test system and find
out for testing I don't want to go over
a crazy amount of benchmarks we don't do
these for these a IB card reviews in
fact I really barely benchmark them at
all truth be told they all deliver
roughly the same performance out of the
box almost always the performance
variance between the slowest and fastest
model is less than 5% however where they
can differ quite substantially is in the
cooling performance and operating volume
so this is what I typically focus on
with my reviews power consumption can
also vary a bit depending on how
aggressive the board partners are with
their bios overclocking I feel is
another metric that should really be
taken with a grain of salt as it depends
on how lucky you are with the silicon
lottery the best PCB design vrm and
cooling means absolutely nothing if you
pair it with poor quality silicon anyway
let's get into it and first up I wanted
to see how hot the gaming Zed was out of
the box so I fired up f1 2018 and run on
a loop for an hour
however after about 20 minutes in the
test it seemed to have just about peaked
hovering between 72 and 73 degrees and
then after the hour tested held at 73
degrees so
a decent result with an ambient room
temperature of 21 degrees the
temperatures all the more impressive
given how quiet the card ran now my room
has a noise floor of 38 decibels so it's
not super duper quiet and apparently the
gaming Z was quieter than that as I was
unable to measure a difference with it
running at full steam immediately I
don't have the best setup for accurately
measuring these quieter graphics cards
but I can tell you it is very quiet you
might have noticed that in the f1 2018
footage at the core held steady at 1950
megahertz and this was the typical
operating frequency seen across a number
of titles that said in other titles at
times it did spike up as high as 1980
megahertz and I did drop as low as
eighteen hundred and seventy megahertz
for brief periods of time but for the
most part it did run at around nineteen
hundred and fifty megahertz as a side
note under the exact same conditions
gigabytes gaming OC Pro fluctuated
between 1935 and 1950 megahertz so not
quite as solid as the msi model in that
regard but very close as for the GDD i6
memory I measured a peak surface
temperature of 71 degrees using k-type
thermocouple z' while the vrm power
stage is picked at 81 degrees again this
is with the 21 degree ambient air
temperature both series of components
are again cooled via very small heat
spreaders so it's unsurprising that
temperatures are quite high but they are
still within spec now moving on to some
gaming benchmarks we see here that when
playing shut off the Tomb Raider it's
basically on par with the gigabyte model
used for testing previously and this
made it 1 to 3 FPS faster than the found
Edition model we see much the same with
Strange Brigade we're really looking at
results that are within the margin of
error though it is clear that these AIB
models are a little bit faster than
nvidias founders edition finally they
have Forza horizon 4 and again just a
few frames in it the MSI gaming said was
solid at least matching the gigabyte
gaming OC Pro or beating it by a frame
overclocking the MSI RT X 2060 gaming
said using MSI Afterburner was a pretty
standard affair the card accepted plus
103 for the core and 800 for the memory
with the power and temp limits maxed out
this resulted in a typical operating
frequency of 2040 megahertz for the core
and then 1950 megahertz for the memory
though MSI report the DDR speed as 7008
and one megahertz then we saw the GPU
max out at 70 degrees which was actually
a three degree drop from the
out-of-the-box temp as the fans are now
spending quite a bit faster the Kippur
temperatures under control overall a
solid overclock and this is about the
best you can expect to see from an RT X
2060 and just lastly wrapping up the
testing I have some quick power
consumption numbers this is total system
consumption and we're testing with the
standard GPU test rig which uses a car I
know 1900 K clocked at 5 gigahertz with
32 gigabytes of ddr4 memory the MSI
gaming Zed consumes around 20 watts or
less than the gigabyte gaming OC pro
model which is a reasonable
out-of-the-box power saving for whatever
reason gigabyte always seems to be very
aggressive with their voltage profiles
and we're seeing that again here still
pretty typical power consumption for the
MSI R model so everything checks out
here overall the MSI r-tx 2060 gaming
z6g it's a nice graphics card albeit a
bit unusual in terms of dimensions the
short fat profile for a lack of a better
term doesn't doesn't really make a huge
amount of sense unless of course I'm
missing something there's some sort of
scenario where it does make sense but
yeah I don't think it makes sense for a
lot of things if you had a mini ITX
system for example which this probably
wouldn't fit in it anyway because it is
a triple slot card you would just buy
while you'd buy a mini ITX version
wouldn't you but if you needed a really
compact graphics card you wouldn't you
wouldn't buy this so for most situations
yeah I don't see it being worthwhile a
most situations would see gamers using a
standard ATX case or maybe even a micro
ATX case but even so for a micro ATX
case this isn't really a huge benefit
over the other high-end RTF 220 60 cards
out there so peculiar point is MSI's
sacrified a little bit of cooling
performance here and for the same money
as Susan G about offer bigger models
with longer heat sinks featuring triple
fan arrangements another issue is the
fact that the GDD are 6 and veeram
components aren't cooled by the main
heatsink as they are with the Assuan
gigabyte models so this will likely mean
higher temperatures for these components
though I will confirm that soon in my
upcoming a seuss ROG Strix RT X 2060 OC
gaming review for now though
it's fair to say the gaming said
certainly isn't bad it is likely in a
bit of a disadvantage when compared to
the soos ROG Strix or gigabyte gaming
Pro OC models and I'm not sure what
advantage of any of the squatty format
offers remember whereas gigabytes card
only occupies two slots this shorter MSI
model takes up three so like I said it's
a bit of a fatty
anyway form factor aside it did run
relatively cool and it was very quiet
which is most important the car also
looks great and the color neutral theme
means that will suit any and all builds
very well overall a solid offering but
at $390 us it may not prove to be the
best choice and that is going to do it
