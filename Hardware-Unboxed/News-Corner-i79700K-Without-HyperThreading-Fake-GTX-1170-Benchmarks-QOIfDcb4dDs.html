corner seems like there's been a fair
bit of news this week which is good
because the last few weeks have been
rather slow in comparison well perhaps I
shouldn't say news because some of the
bigger stories to emerge this week are
actually rumors relating to major
upcoming launches from Intel and NVIDIA
so I'll be talking a bit about those and
whether they appear legitimate followed
by a selection of genuine news topics so
let's get into it
over the past few days it's been hard to
escape rumors surrounding Intel's
upcoming eight core processes allegedly
to be the I nine ninety nine hundred K
and I seven ninety seven hundred K
multiple reports have emerged throughout
the week claiming to provide
specifications for these chips and
there's a few interesting things to come
of that firstly these rumors are
suggesting the Christ 790 700 K will
feature eight cores but just eight
threads in other words it will not
support hyper threading this rumour
first appeared in a set of
specifications posted on Chinese website
kilala and then a few days later an i7
9700 k appeared in the C soft Sandra
database also showing a processor with
just eight threads
it seems unusual that Intel would make
the i7 9700 K apart without hyper
threading considering basically all core
i7 desktop CPUs in the past have
included the feature we'd also end up
with the situation where the core i7
8700 K a six core 12 thread CPU has more
logical cores than the 9700 K not that
it would necessarily perform better than
a CPU with eight physical cores but it'd
be an interesting situation for Intel's
lineup
however it is possible Intel would
remove hyper threading from Knights
Genco i7 parts to make room for a
qura√≠an nine at the top end that does
include hyper threading as seems to be
the case from these rumors the I $9.99
hundred K is alleged to be an
eight-course sixteen thread CPU and that
would cascade down to eight core eight
thread core i7 parts then six core six
thread core i5 parts and so forth so I
guess they would still be that clear
difference between each product segment
with two separate sources for this room
it seems like this hyper threading
business might be a legitimate though of
course with all rumors we suggest you
with a grain of salt what's less clear
is the clock speeds these processes will
be using the cool allure post suggest
the 9700 K will be clocked at a 3.6
gigahertz base and have a max turbo
clock of 4.9 gigahertz and that base
clock is also seen in the Sandra listing
we're also looking at 12 megabytes of
level 3 cache then the 9900 K would come
in also at a 3.6 gigahertz base but then
boost up to a maximum of 5 gigahertz
with 16 megabytes of level 3 cache both
CPUs apparently have a 95 watt TDP
though that reading tends to be pretty
meaningless these days what makes me
question these clock speed figures
particularly the turbo clocks is that
the kalila article also lists the core
i5 and 9600 K as having a 4.6 gigahertz
turbo clock however Intel's official
documents that leaked the 9600 K a
couple of weeks ago showed the chip is
topping out at 4.5 gigahertz it's a
small discrepancy but it throws into
question the validity of the report I
think the final products will end up
being pretty close to what is being
reported on here but an official launch
shouldn't be too far away so let's keep
an eye out on this one
the other major rumor from this week
surrounded a gtx 1170 benchmark posted
on wucf tech this one to me doesn't look
right from a number of perspectives so
let's dig into it the benchmark is a
screen photo of a 3d mark fire strike
score which is suspicious in itself as
it's not actual screen shot and the
score is seen as 20 to 999 which will
put it in GT X 1080 Ti territory there's
not overly surprising considering with
Pascal in video launch the gtx 1070 with
980 TI level performance however it's
the specifications that are pretty
dubious the card is listed as having 16
gigabytes of memory which seems pretty
high the volta based Titan VIII only
includes 12 gig of memory and we know
how expensive memory is these days so
doubling the capacity from the gtx 1070
seems not quite right especially is a
lot of today's games don't make full use
of 8 gigabytes at this point even more
suspicious are the clock speeds the card
is listed as pushing up to 25 52
megahertz which is more than 800
megahertz higher than the highest clock
Pascal card and certainly well above
what most Pascal cards will do when
overclocked heavily at this point it
seems certain Envy
is next-gen cards will be using TS MCS
twelve nanometer manufacturing process
and the gains from 16 nanometers used
with Pascal to 12 nanometers simply
won't give you that sort of clock speed
gain so I'm calling this one fake and I
think a lot of other people probably
have come to that conclusion by now as
well in legitimate NVIDIA GPUs the
company has launched a new bundle to try
and push existing Pascal cards out
through the door as fast as they can if
we are offering a free Kingston SSD with
eligible purchases of some graphics
cards either a 120 gig model or a 240
gig model depending on the SKU it
appears these bundles are only for the
GTX 1050 TR and GTX 1060 so no higher
end cards unfortunately and it's also UK
only at this stage still if you live in
UK and you want one of these graphics
cards you may as well get one with a
free SSD this story appeared in our
patreon exclusive discord chat earlier
in the week and I thought it was pretty
interesting for the more enthusiast
builders out there overclocking master
build Zoid published a video earlier in
the week going through some of the vrm
configurations on upcoming B 450
motherboards and slammed gigabyte in
particular for completely faking their
8+3 phase vrm design furthers that love
the technical stuff here's 50 minute
long rant is worth a watch but
essentially gigabytes vrm design
actually omits one of the MOSFETs in
each of the phases and doesn't use the
controller that's actually eight phase
compatible so the boards only truly use
a four plus three phase design this is
despite the board's appearing to have
eight phases as a inductors or chokes
are visible gigabyte has since come out
and admitted they're eight plus three
phase marketing was an error and
mentioned to us via email that they'll
be updating their product packaging for
these be 450 boards to correct the error
gigabytes website has also been updated
removing any reference to the eight plus
three design for the affected boards
will have some performance metrics for
these gigabyte p450 boards coming next
week and it's pretty interesting stuff
so stay tuned for that one this story
came in screaming hot house writing up
today's news corner episode Intel have
announced that the first system is
powered by ten nanometer processes will
be available in the second half of 2019
in time to the holiday season
previously Intel delayed mass production
of
ten nanometers - sometime in 2019 so
this update gives some clarity on when
that will actually be and of course it
seems Intel isn't counting that one
laptop with a low volume ten nanometer
chip inside when they made this
statement 14 nanometer will still play a
part in 2019 with Intel stating they
will have a leadership 14 nanometer
product lineup for 2019 whatever that
means and 10 animated data center chips
will come shortly after consumer chips
in late 2019 though no exact timeframe
for that was given knowing Intel
struggles to get 10 nanometer
functioning it'll be interesting to see
how it stacks up come late 2019 and
especially how it will compete with 7
nanometer tech from other foundries
here's another Intel story for you the
company has launched new bean Canyon
knucks
yep bean Canyon which packed 28 watt
coffee like you processes with RS plus
graphics 655 inside the processors
include a fork or a thread CPU clocked
up to 4 point 5 gigahertz in the highest
in core i7 8559 new plus the beefier 655
GPU the PAX double the execution units
of Intel standard integrated graphics
the Knux also includes stuff like two
sodium's slots a 2.5 inch drive bay and
some morals and m22 280s SD slot Intel
wireless AC 95 60 plenty of ports
including Thunderbolt 3 it's basically
all the stuff you'd usually expect from
a nook beam Canyon won't be super
powerful or anything like that but it
could be a decent solution for some use
cases these knocks will go on sale in
early August although we don't have
pricing just yet last week one of our
headline stories was the problems with
the latest MacBook Pro specifically
throttling concerns well this week Apple
has released a software update that
addresses some of these issues apple
claims a missing digital key in the
firmware was the cause of aggressive
underclocking under high loads and
temperatures and they've released a new
version of Mac OS hi Sierra to fix that
now digital key sounds like the world of
crap to me but the patch does actually
modify how the CPU behaves under load
and as a result performance is
noticeably improved it's still not at
the level you'd expect from a properly
cooled core I 9 processor in a larger
laptop so Apple's thermal design is
still restricting the processes somewhat
but at least it's not throttling
aggressively AMD's risin 5 2500 X has
appeared in an OEM system from Acer the
2500 X hasn't been officially announced
by AMD just yet but it's expected to be
a 4 core 8 threads CPU clocked at 3.6
gigahertz with a boost clock of 4.0
gigahertz the CPU should launch soon
alongside a risin 320 300 X so it's
probably a mistake on Asus part to put
up this new nitro in 5100 system ahead
of time de nouveaux makers of the
world's most aggressive and effective
anti-piracy solution for games has sued
the founder of piracy group revolt who
were the first to crack the technology
through the help of Bulgaria's police
the founder was allegedly identified as
ARCA voxi probably a terrible
pronunciation there who had his personal
PC seized among other things voxi said
he would stop his de nouveaux cracking
efforts immediately as a result of the
legal action it'll be interesting to see
how that legal case ends up and whether
voxi actually broke any laws in his
efforts to remove de nouveaux from games
final news topic from this week the guys
over at PC Gamer have tested Monster
Hunter World on Pacey and that was quite
demanding so prepare your systems for
what could be a tough game to run one of
their editors had a gtx 980ti and using
the high preset at 1440p delivered under
60fps and another had a 7700 HQ laptop
with the gtx 1070 and got around 45 FPS
on the highest preset at 1080p of course
we'll take a look at how the game
performs across a wider range of
hardware around its launch on August 9th
