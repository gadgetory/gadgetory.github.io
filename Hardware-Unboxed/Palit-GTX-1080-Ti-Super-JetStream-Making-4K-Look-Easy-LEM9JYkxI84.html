today's video we have a review of
pallets massive gtx 1080i super
Jetstream graphics card as you can see
this thing is a serious beast last week
I did check out the Auris 1080 Ti and I
was very impressed with that model but
since then a heap of you have been
asking me to review the super Jetstream
so here we are
like most gtx 980ti graphics cards of
the super jet stream is big really big
the card itself weighs thirteen hundred
and forty two grams and while that isn't
quite as heavy as the RS model we looked
at last week it's about a hundred grams
less it will certainly still give your
PCI Express slot a real workout the PCB
measures 267 millimeters long and the
card structures are further 18
millimeters thanks to the oversized
cooler the huge cooler takes up not two
but rather three slots at 48 millimeters
thick
in comparison the foundry position
cooler measures just 35 millimeters
thick and 266 millimeters long and those
are more typical dimensions fragile slot
graphics card the PCB is also 20
millimeters tall than standard allowing
the graphics card to stand 133
millimeters tall under the large fan
shroud which I should point out has been
constructed from plastic with anodized
aluminium trimmings we find through
truly massive heat sinks in total
there's 120 millimeters by 185
millimeters at 30 millimeters thick
worth of heatsink improving efficiency
our five copper heat pipes two of which
measure 10 millimeters wide and they're
the fattest heat pipes I've ever seen
feature on our graphics card the heat
pipes are also connected to a large
copper base plate pushing large volumes
of air over this huge heatsink area a to
big 100 millimeter fans
these fans are extremely quiet even when
the card is been placed under full load
for an extended period of time the
reworked PCB features a 12 phase power
design for the GPU
it's a doubled up is on but it does
deliver more power than required for the
gtx 980ti GPU then we have a true two
phase vrm for the gddr5 x memory pellets
also upgrade the power in
by going with a dual eight pin design
around the back we do find a full size
backplate protecting the backside of the
card
though I have to admit it's a little
boring in terms of design the i/o
configuration remains standard with a
single dual link DVI output HDMI 2.0 B
and three display ports out of the box
the card comes clocked at fifteen
hundred and thirty one megahertz for the
base with a boost clock of sixteen
hundred and forty five megahertz the
gddr5 X memory though has been left
stock at 5500 megahertz for a throughput
of 11 gigabits per second impressively
the card have a boost clock speed of at
least eighteen hundred and ninety eight
megahertz which is slightly higher than
the 1886 megahertz the Auris card ran
out for the most part out of the box the
cards had at nineteen hundred thirty six
megahertz though which again is very
impressive over clocks the pallet gtx
1082 I wasn't able to sustain a boost
clock speed of two thousand and twelve
megahertz so that's a seven percent
overclock which isn't bad for a gtx
980ti anyway before we get to that I'm
going to go about things a little
differently for this review rather than
just show you the same old boring
benchmark graphs that show the pallet
gtx 1080i delivering similar or the same
performance as other 1080 TI cards we've
looked at let's take a little bit some
in-game performance and see what the
card is really capable of at the 4k
resolution once we've done that i'll
throw up the usual temperature and power
consumption graphs so you can check
those out for testing this mighty
graphics card we have used our corsair
sponsered GPU test rig which features a
core i7 7700 k clocked at 4.9 gigahertz
with 32 gigabytes of ddr4 3000 memory in
the crystal series 570 x mid tailored
case for testing i have looked at how
the super jet stream handled itself in
six games at the 4k resolution i'll show
each game for about a minute before
moving on and then afterwards we will
discuss the performance
we have taken objective Edward we have
taken objective apples
a second
yow
1919-1920 220
as you've just seen out of the box the
pallet GTX 1082 our super jet stream is
a very capable 4k Damer pushing over
60fps and the titles tested using the
very high quality visual settings
battlefield 1 for example was tested
using the ultra quality preset and the
game still hovered in the mid 70s over
which was good for well over 100 FPS as
we often saw around 160 fps using the
ultra quality preset even Mass Effect
Andromeda saw over 60fps for the most
part as did prey in f1 2016 we saw
somewhere around 70 to 90 FPS depending
on the scene the most demanding title
tested was Ghost Recon wildlands that
could be argued that the some
optimization issues there but anyway
using the high quality preset the
framerate did often dip into the 50s
overclocking the super jet stream
manually saw the boost clock set at 2012
megahertz and our protest and the fan
speed maxed out at 58% so the card was
still very quiet while maintaining over
2000 megahertz throughout our testing
when it comes to power consumption the
super jet stream didn't actually consume
that much more power than the founders
Edition model in fact total system
consumption increased by just 6%
overclocking boosted system consumption
by another 12% but at 435 watts this was
still a good bit less than the Auris
model here we see that the super jet
stream clearly has a temp target of 74
degrees this was the same maximum
temperature scene even when overclocking
obviously when overclocked the fan did
spin up a little faster to deal with the
other load but it was still far from
loud in fact by manually sending the fan
speed and increasing it a bit to just
2200 rpm though cards operating
temperature was still very quiet while
the temperatures dropped to just 64
degrees this was a good demonstration at
least in my opinion of just how powerful
the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti is it really
does make single GPU 4k gaming a reality
the fact that we could max out beautiful
looking titles such as battlefield 1
while playing at the 4k resolution and
still achieving over 60 FPS is a
testament to in videos flagship gaming
GPU pellet super jet stream does a good
job of extracting their maximum
performance from the GTX 1080 Ti out of
the box it's possible to extract a few
more
frames are custom overclocking but
really it's almost not worth it palette
really has done all the work for you
this is a good thing as there
Thrustmaster software is a bit clumsy
and in my opinion looks very dated
speaking of looks the super jet stream
is at risk of being a little too bland
in my opinion especially when compared
to models from MSI Isuzu and gigabyte
for example still it will blend into
most systems well enough though we do
hope the RGB lighting on future models
will be a little less casual I put it
tacky-looking the only other gripe I
have with the card design is that chrome
strip on the front of the graphics card
well it does look very nice it scuffs
very easily and once scuffed the effect
is kind of lost looks aside though the
cooler does work very well and it's very
quiet even under load and it's great to
see that palette hasn't skimped on those
thermal pads those monstrous 10
millimeter copper heat pipes look very
mighty as well it's a bit of a shame
palette didn't do a better job of
showing those bad boys off lastly
there's the issue of the price which we
can't actually address at this point as
it's not currently on sale in the US or
Australia at least not from the usual
suspects so it's hard to draw any
concrete conclusions without knowing the
retail price
if pallet can undercut the Gigabyte Oris
model that i looked at last week then i
think they have a real winner on their
hands historically pallet have been very
competitive on their pricing so I expect
this model to come in pretty close to
that $700 US MSRP overall the pallet GTX
can atti
super jetstream it delivers exceptional
performance especially for those wanting
a game at 4k hardly breaks a sweat there
anyway that's going to do it for this
one I hope you enjoyed the format change
I thought it was nice to sort of show
you the performance of what it can do it
for K rather than just show a graph
where hey it's pretty much the same as
the Auris card we looked at last week
one or two frames different it's not
terribly exciting so something a bit
different
won't always review graphics cards this
way but I thought for this one a bit of
a format change was necessary so I hope
you guys agree I'm your host Steve see
you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
