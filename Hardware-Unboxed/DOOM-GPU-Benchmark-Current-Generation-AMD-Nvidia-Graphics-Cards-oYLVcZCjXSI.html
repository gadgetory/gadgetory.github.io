GeForce GTX 1080 review coverage any day
now
but in the meantime I've taken a quick
look at the new doom game in particular
how performs on PC using the current
generation GPUs midway through last
month there was an open beta weekend for
doom and I did take a quick look at the
game back then but didn't provide a
benchmark video the reason for this was
simple at the time the game was capped
at 60 fps and also had limited tunable
quality settings thankfully now the game
has been officially released those two
issues have been sorted and we can now
smash demon skulls a high frame rates
with ultra quality settings speaking of
which any of my younger viewers might
want to avoid this video as Jim is a
very violent game and I'll be showing
some of the goryo scenes in the games
such as those animated glory kill clips
the doom reboot has been built on the
new id tactics game engine which is
quite different to pretty much every
other modern gaming engine in the sense
that he utilizes OpenGL while Vulkan API
support will be patched in at a later
date for those of you unaware Vulcan is
the successor to OpenGL offering an
open-source alternative to Microsoft
proprietary DirectX API Vulcan is
cross-platform Meeny isn't limited to
Windows and other Microsoft platforms
like DirectX is and will be supported by
Google's Android and Valve steam OS
dooms a single and multiplayer game but
I'll be testing the single-player
portion as it really isn't possible to
accurately benchmark the multiplayer
modes this isn't really an issue anyway
is from GPU performance perspective the
results should be much the same and more
to the point the performance margins
between the various AMD and NVIDIA
graphics cards will certainly be the
same as usual I'll be testing using the
high-end in-game quality settings at the
three most commonly gained resolutions
being 1080p 1440p and 4k
this meant enabling the ultra preset
while manually turning the shadow
quality and virtual texturing page size
options to the nightmare setting
performance wise there are only a few
frames difference between running these
two graphical settings on ultra
nightmare for those wondering before we
jump into the results let's watch the
rest of the benchmark pass
IT software Peter worked more closely
with Nvidia on this title and it's been
used to show off the new Nvidia 1080 of
press events of late the following
results tell the same story at 1080p the
GTX 960 was 6% faster than the r9 380
not a huge margin but we're more used to
seeing the 380 on top of that battle the
big shock here is how poorly the 390 X
and 390 compared to the GTX 970 granted
the Radeon graphics cards do struggle at
1080p due to the driver overhead but a
27% margin favoring the 970 over the 390
X is massive the fury X can also be seen
battling the GTX 980 making a 17 percent
slower than the gtx 980ti
so some out-of-place results here from
the AMD GPUs for sure jump into 1440p
all graphics cards tested were able to
deliver playable performance though the
input lag when using the gtx 960 in r9
380 was quite severe the 319 390x
provided playable performance but again
it was the GTX 970 that provided the
perfect balance of price versus
performance now at 4k we find the game
as well ideally want more than one GPU
as the gtx 980ti and titan next did drop
down to 41 FPS on occasion the game was
still playable but a 40 FPS does feel
noticeably different to 60 FPS as most
first-person shooters do 4k is where the
next-generation GPU is gonna shine and I
expect that tomorrow's launch of the GT
X 1080 you will see some very impressive
results those of you rocking AMD
hardware will no doubt be a bit
disappointed with these results which
recorded using the latest crimson
sixteen point five point two drivers
apparently designed to support doom
these results seem to imply that it's an
Nvidia supporter title although I
haven't seen anything official but that
would explain why it runs so poorly on
AMD hardware some believe though that
there could be something more sinister
going on here and there's certainly some
strong evidence of that using a radiant
graphics card forces the game to run an
older version of OpenGL version 4.3
Nvidia graphics cards on the other hand
use the more up-to-date opengl 4.5
the lead renderer programmer at id
Software said this was a mistake
that can be seen when using the ultra
quality settings however I found that
the game would load opengl 4.3 on AMD
hardware regardless of quality settings
even with the game's low quality preset
hopefully this is a genuine mistake but
it does seem very shady to say
least what I find interesting is that
those who benchmark doom during the
alpha stage showed very strong
performance an AMD Hardware then the
open beta dropped and NVIDIA managed to
just take the lead now we have the
official release and AMD is almost
nowhere to be seen in terms of
performance opengl 4.3 was released in
august of 2012 while version 4.5 came
exactly two years later and with it came
a number of improvements in efficiency
that would account for the performance
discrepancies we've seen here so with
AMD's performance whereas appearing to
be entirely in the hands of id Software
I'm hoping to see a game update in the
very near future the good news for
Radian owners is the despite
underperforming the 390 and 390x still
provided a very smooth playable
experience of 1440p with all the eye
candy turned up there were no graphical
glitches or crashes of any kind rather
we do get a pretty satisfying gaming
experience another interesting footnote
worth mentioning is the crossfire and
SLI don't work in this game and I'm not
sure of support we patched in also for
the single-player portion of the game
the CPU really isn't that important and
even lowly dual cores such as the
pentium g 4400 deliver excellent
performance finally you guys might want
to stay tuned because tomorrow night
I'll be getting busy with this little
lady and you'll be getting the explicit
uncut director's edition so if you
haven't yet hit subscribe and I'll see
you guys tomorrow
cannot be allowed to leave this place
I'm willing to take full responsibility
for the harmful effects of the last 24
hours</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
