month's QA we're not gonna waste any
time let's get straight into the
questions all right
the very first question for this month's
Q&amp;amp;A comes from Elliot by a Pascal GPU
now or wait for invidious next
generation of GPUs huh well we've been
asked this one a lot so if you have to
address it at some point I'm not sure if
the next-gen GPUs are coming
well next month or in the next six
months it's really impossible to say I
don't think anyone in the media really
knows or could know we're pretty certain
that there are new GPUs coming sometime
this year and they'll offer some kind of
performance improvement or more
efficient than what we currently have
but of course we just don't know my
advice would be at the very least wait
till after Computex to see if anything
gets announced there and Tim and I will
be at the show in two weeks time two and
a half weeks and we'll we'll cover it
there and let you know if not hopefully
then in two or three weeks time graphics
card pricing will have dropped a bit
further so if you can't really wait any
longer then you know two or three weeks
you might save a bit of money opposed to
buying now and you will have given
Nvidia a chance to announce any new GPU
so if they're going to alright this
question comes from shader aid why
doesn't anyone show real-world
benchmarks like we all know Intel has
better single core scores for FPS but
most gamers are multitasking at the same
time while gaming there's music playing
etc you know on a second monitor you've
been playing hard row and box videos got
the kind of stuff how does Intel single
core
scores hold it up in game while
multitasking behind it huh alright to
part of it yeah well we'll tackle the
first part of it first so the kind of
real world benchmarking being suggested
here the reason we don't do it just
because it's unreliable yeah yeah I've
looked into this before and the results
in my opinion is way too inconsistent so
depending on what applications or what
you have open for a start then what
those applications are doing at any
given time during the benchmark that can
impact the results and well I gather
that is more real-world it's not really
great for accurately comparing how
two different CPUs perform so you'll see
situations where a fork or CPU might be
beat or might beat an eight-core CPU for
example of even the same architecture
and even a three run average won't
necessarily fix or smooth out those
results so yeah it's just the
inconsistencies there you'll find when
testing with other things running in the
background doing uncontrolled things so
that's why we don't do it I suggest
though if you do care about gaming
performance then the best practice is
just to ensure that anything that can
heavily influence performance is just
closed before you gave me any other
place competitive games would be doing
that anyway because the last thing you
want is in the heat of the moment you're
about to fire on someone and you get to
the lag because some program and the
backgrounds decided to install something
or update or whatever so yeah close your
programs and as for things like playing
music in the background that really has
no real impact on modern processors
basically zero impact even on something
like a G 45 60 and the same is true for
movies and TV shows so you should be
seeing very little performance impact
there and the same also goes for
downloading torrents for example and
just finally test systems don't
comprised of some unrealistic skeleton
Krew of applications writing it's just a
standard unaltered version of Windows 10
professional we have the performance
monitoring software that we use things
like storage and graphics utilities and
then I have you know steam you player
origin I imagine you have all the same
sort of stuff on your laptops so there's
a fair bit of software there anyway
quite a bit of memories being used as
soon as we start the system up so or
taking all that stuff into account
that's another reason why it's so
important that we do do an average of
three runs so we do get consistent
results ok next question is from Molag
Tang 23 sure I got that right
is there any difference in memory
compatibility with a first generation
ship between X 370 and X 470 boards
since the IMC is in the CPU I feel like
there shouldn't be any difference but
it's good to know if you can get a cheap
Rison 7 first gen part ok well no there
isn't I didn't I know I tested this in
my original review when I was having a
few problems with the X 370 boards but
that was down to biases the boss that I
was using just had a few issues there
with the memory that I was trying
I haven't gone back and done a whole lot
of further testing or follow-up testing
for that but I have seen a few others
that have done testing and they found
that the X 370 boards are identical to
the X 470 boards up that's assuming that
you're comparing a board of similar
quality so it really comes down to how
many layers the PCB is how well it's
designed for high frequency memory and
stuff like that but if you have an X 370
board and an X 470 board the only
difference on them is the chipset and
they've got the same quality bass the
same board then you will see the same
results okay next question is from luck
a you would you recommend upgrading from
my current sir it's an i7 2670 5m
motherboard to 12 gigabytes rather of
ddr3 memory and a GTX 670 and or what
path would I take gaming for the most
part although I do love how horizon or
the rise and lineup is looking in terms
of productivity so I'm gonna give you a
got that yeah I think only if you need
to feel and if you feel the need to
upgrade at this point I think you know
the graphics card there is probably the
weakest link so you know if you threw in
something like gtx 1060 or RX 5 and
you'd see a pretty big performance up
lifting games you know alternately if
you need a completely brand new system
for gaming you know the core i5 8400 is
pretty cost-effective at the moment
though you know if you care more about
productivity than the rise of v 2600
might be a better option of course they
have that superior upgrade path well yes
I've got me motherboards and that sort
of thing so yeah that's probably where
where it lands at the moment yeah I
think so I think that's pretty much how
I would have tackled that one so good
job Tim all right this question comes
from nod hope I got that right how come
you resisted the easy money offered by
SCD Keys for advertising stolen om
windows keys do you have any advice for
the affected youtubers they think money
is better than reputation I'll touch
that last bit better yeah well we just
avoided them because well maybe some of
what you said in that comment
probably not the most reputable
advertised that we could choose so but
honestly I've never really looked into
them that closely just because when they
contacted us they didn't want to do
in stream ads our rather they wanted a
dedicated sponsor video and for us
that's really a big no-no so yeah not
the type of video we want to do all the
topic content we want to make that's
more in our opinion sort of what just
out this sort of sell out content yeah
so not sort of stuff we want to do but
is that desk
that's a really good vacuum yeah yeah
this question is from Abraham what do
you expect from Computex 2018 hmm good
question
well I think what's guaranteed is
complete like a sleep hopefully a fair
bit of fun yeah I suppose you're asking
their product wise what we expect to see
and that's a tough one Tim and I sort of
we discussed that on the patreon
livestream we're having a good thing
about that I'm definitely expecting some
new motherboards yeah new motherboards
so you said 390 chipset from Intel and
then there's Ed 490 from AMD which
seriously AMD I can't believe this ed
490 is actually a thing I was pretty
shocked by that so stupid and then other
than that maybe some some second gen
thread Ripper yeah I think that might be
a chance of new stuff from Nvidia but
it's really hard to tell at this point
even went though only a couple weeks out
you know it's really going to be when
we're there that we start to see yeah
what sort of things are coming up yeah
so fingers crossed for new GPUs but yeah
who knows alright next question is from
Peter pairing and NVIDIA GPU with the
free sync monitor what will you see 144
FPS but stuttering or just 60 FPS so the
only real thing that freesync provides
is adaptive sync support so when you're
running on an AMD card you get adaptive
sync when you're running on an Nvidia
card you don't get adaptive sync so
aside from that every other feature
should work perfectly fine so in the
case of a 144 Hertz monitor with free
sync on an NVIDIA GPU you'll definitely
be able to run all the way up to 144
Hertz maximum refresh no problems but of
course you won't get adaptive sync so
depending on whether you use vsync on or
off you either get stuttering or screen
tearing below 144 FBI
and then of course above it the same
sort of problems as anybody has so yeah
precinct motors work perfectly fine with
NVIDIA GPUs but you're just missing out
on that variable refresh rate technology
yep glad you answered that because I
only clicked halfway through the what he
was actually asking about yeah that's an
interesting question
yeah next question is from King what
systems do you guys use for video
editing and gaming apologies if this has
been answered before somewhere I don't
know if it has now that's fine you can
ask well I use the three rip in nineteen
fifty X now I mean actually using that
for quite a few months I still have not
built my 1950 X system it's still
sitting on a bit of foam in my office so
yeah that's a bit embarrassing but I'll
do that at some point probably by the
time ii jump over if it comes around we
asked my editing / workstation so that's
where I spend most of my time and then I
have a separate gaming system it's not
actually the one that's in here but well
this is another thread Ripper core i7 87
or okay system but I haven't another set
upstairs that I use for gaming yes and
that's just got again a Geforce GTX 1080
T I can't really beat that combo for
gaming some quite happy with it
yep unlike Steve I have just one system
these for both my editing and gaming
there are only two - just at the moment
so I've still on my rise in 7 1700 X in
there we're playing to upgrade that to
2700 X on the same board nice
compatibility stuff there and then I
have Titan X Pascal for gain so
basically the same as a 1080 TI and yeah
that's been really good so far
yeah I'm not too bad on the Jeep well
both you CPU and GPU are very
respectable yeah obviously the GPU is
hard to beat
yeah it's great for I've got an
ultra-wide say 34 40 by 1440 and yeah it
runs really well yep I think perfect
all-rounder really yep right this
questions from Daniel why does the GA
990 FX AUD 3 all true exists in M 3 plus
a motherboard or behind with the USB 3.1
type C and an MDOT 2 slot is this tech
wasted on this older platform yeah it's
hard to say why that one exists I guess
it's because all of you are insane ok
maybe not maybe not you guys watching
this video but there's plenty of insane
shoppers out there snapping up FX 8350
processors
now can you believe this they are
consistently CPUs consistently make
their way into Amazon's top 20 best cpu
sellers list bulldozer CV 2018 and
they're in the top 20 so they're beating
out like skylake X CPUs and stuff I mean
I suppose people are seeing you know an
8 core CPU for it I think it was 98
dollars basically $100 u.s. last time I
checked there just going add that to
cart maybe because the hype around rise
and they just think that's you know
maybe that unfortunate yeah well yeah I
I went and checked the rating as well
and they're getting four and a half
stars out of five star that's the rating
and that's like 2,000 insane customers
so yeah I'd say that's why gigabytes
decide to release that new 990 FX
motherboard because people are still
snapping up you know FX processors if
you can believe that
alright next that we have Clint
Excalibur 71 alright with SEC laughs not
with second gen rise and springing hot
this season will be better to buy a
first generation processor at a cheaper
price or second gen in terms of price to
performance okay well I think it's time
Tim took on a question so okay so well
mister Excalibur I guess it depends on
on how much cheaper you can get the
first gen rise and parts for I guess
right here right now sorry here in
Australia you know 1600 is just thirty
bucks cheaper than the 2600 and if at
that sort of price you definitely
wouldn't touch the first gen part over
on Amazon the 1600 is $15 us saving
again so I guess I wouldn't go near for
that sort of tiny saving yes the 2600 is
190 us sixteen hundred's 175 us so yeah
we'd have to be around 150 us I'd sort
of say for the 1604 to be sort of worth
it yeah I think 150 us is a great price
for that CP or if you can get it lower I
think some of the guys some of our US
viewers are saying a Micro Center that's
a big day we're doing like motherboard
and CPU combos for insane like 150 or
something like that so that if you see
that obviously get that but I think 150
us or lower that's a good
yep this question is from Mario Rison
320 200 G or Rison 520 400 G which is
the best value for money hmm I think you
really have to what would you get with
the 22 our jury yeah yeah I think the
rise in 322 energy all day on that one
the 2500 G it's a good APU good it's
just a bit too expensive really that's
the only bad thing about it comes out of
pricing doesn't it which is what you're
asking I think they are 170 us is the
MSRP and they're currently selling for
about that 160 us maybe 225 Ozzy so a
bit pricey for a quad core with SMT so
it needs again another CP it probably
needs to be about 150 us at most to make
sense and I think that's a very similar
conclusion to what we came to in our day
1 coverage and that video there was
about half an hour long though so even I
didn't watch all of it so I'll let him
off on that one all right Steve this
next question comes from a user who's
chosen the username of the saucy goblin
shark how ddr5 or near memory affect
AMD's ApS in terms of performance ok
that's a good question
well assuming the timings aren't slacker
than AMD's chips at naming division I'd
say pretty massive seriously though
put it this way I'd say or what's
another way to look at it maybe if you
were to say if Raven Ridge used ddr3
2400 memories that's probably a good way
to go back a bit if you put ddr3 memory
with a Raven Ridge APU it would be a lot
slower than the ddr4 2933 memory that's
probably a good way to look at it so
assuming we see the same sort of late
with ddr5 memory then yeah it should
just take the AP use to the next level
so oh yeah yeah so I think we'd see
really massive gains there nice frame
rate boosts and yeah should be good
let's hope ok so we're going to stop
there good amount of questions for part
1 hope you guys have enjoyed it so far
part 2 will be coming not tomorrow
probably the day after we'll have
something some some other special
content for you tomorrow so keep your
eyes peeled for that speaking of which
make sure you subscribe like this video
and I'm your host Steve and I missed him
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
