geforce gtx 1080 graphics cards i've
reviewed so far is the game with phoenix
gel h which for those wondering is the
same product as the pallet GT x 1080
gamer of premium edition the game we
brand is owned by palette and has been
since way back in 2005 this means those
that didn't like the red gold and black
design of the phoenix gel age have the
option to purchase it in blue grey and
white as the game Rock PE now the
arrival of gtx 1060 we find a similar
situation consumers have the choice of
the gamer gtx 1060 golden sample or
pallet gtx 1060 jetstream the game would
card sticks with the same color scheme
is this bigger 1080 brother while the
pallid GTX 1060 jetstream features much
more neutral colors pilot is going with
a very cool-looking silver and black
theme and this should really suit just
about any build like the founders
Edition the jetstream measures 250
millimeters long but while invidious
design stands 110 millimeters tall the
jet stream is 123 millimeters tall
thanks for the oversized cooler speaking
of which the college has been
constructed primarily from plastic but
does feature aluminium trimmings which
have been painted silver moving air over
the heatsink below or a pair of 90
millimeter fans featuring palettes new
turbo fan blade design these fans are
extremely quiet even when the card has
been placed on the logo for an extended
period in total there's two hundred and
ten millimeters by 73 millimeters at 28
millimeters thick worth of heatsink
improving efficiency of four six
millimeter copper heat pipes which
connect to a large base plate that also
covers the six gddr5 memory chips as
well as the VRMs the PCB design has been
changed and now we find a four plus one
power phase design a slight upgrade over
the founders Edition the PCB also
stretches the full length of the card so
again we find the six p-m PCIe power
connector at the end of the graphics cub
that being the case no upgrades to the
power input have been made so there's
nothing here that really suggests the
jet stream will overclock any better
than the fans Edition graphics card out
of the box the pallid GTX 1060 super jet
stream does come in the factory
overclock the base clock has been set at
1620 megahertz which results in a boost
clock of 1847 megahertz
the memory base has been left at 2
gigahertz
in the same data rate of a gigabits per
second that's an 8% core overclock and
nothing on the memory around the back we
find a huge full-size backplate
protecting the card though the aluminium
plate is pretty boring in terms of
design the i/o configuration remains
standard with a single dual link DVI
output HDMI 2.0 B and three display
ports when it came to overclocking the
card we were able to push the memory up
to 2300 to megahertz
while the core reach 1745 megahertz
resulting in a boost clock a 1973
megahertz however due to the way a GPU
boost 3.0 technology works the gtx 1060
jetstream spent most of its time
operating at about 2.1 gigahertz just
like the founders Edition again we
weren't able to increase the voltage but
the power target was maxed out at 119
percent for a full list of the test
system specs please check the video
description and please note only AMD and
video reference cards have been used
alright let's get into the benchmarks
first up we've got everyone's favorite
ARMA 3 here the Pella car performs
identically to the founds Edition
out-of-the-box and with our customer
clock applied it was 2 FPS faster at
1440p next we've got our staple game
benchmark in battlefield 4 and again the
results on the palette card are very
similar to that of the founders Edition
this time it was 2 FPS faster out of the
box and again 2 FPS faster with our
customers he applied Far Cry primal show
very similar result again with the jet
stream managing to get a single frame
over the factory clock bounce Edition
and again 2 FPS higher once both cards
were overclocked okay so you're starting
to get the picture in Just Cause 3
palette card was a single frame faster
and here in star wars battlefront it was
identical out of the box and 2 frames
faster when overclocked and finally in
the division it was again just a single
frame faster at the stock clocks and 2
frames faster when overclocked
this palette card managed to scrape in
these very few extra frames over the 10
60 founds Edition whilst consuming an
additional 10 watts of power on average
so there was a slight trade-off there we
often see board partner cards using more
than invidious reference cards so no
real surprises here I perhaps expected
better cooling than we saw here from the
partner car but that's compared to
invidious bounds Edition which honestly
seems to have a really good quality
cooler on board that's already doing a
great job at Norma's dead silent 1000
rpm the jet stream did let the 1060 GPU
reach
70 degrees which is quite a bit hotter
than the 64 degrees of the found
Sedition card however if I manually
increase the fan speed to 1,400 rpm the
card was just audible and dropped down
to just 62 degrees using the automatic
fan profile with our custom overclock
applied the temps rose to 73 degrees
palette is clearly focused on operating
volume rather than operating
temperatures so with the super jet
stream and with the temps well below 80
degrees it makes sense as I wrap up this
review I'm reminded of my first GT X
1080 review based on the gigabyte g1
gaming I walked away from that review
pretty disappointed with the cards
performance Nova clocking Headroom
however after testing numerous other GT
X 1080 graphics cards it quickly became
clear the g1 gaming was getting the most
out of invidious new Pascal GPU I
suspect the same will be true for the
GTX 1060 in palette super jet stream for
the most part the palette car was just 1
to 2 FPS faster and out of the box
configuration than when comparing the
maximum stable overclocked performance
of both cards the jet stream again came
out on top by just 1 to 2 fps
unfortunately it did run slightly hotter
and consume slightly more power to the
good news though was the operating
volume which was near silent even with
the fan forced to spin at 1400 RPM the
card was very cool and we quickly saw
the load temperature dropped to 262
degrees of course the real victory here
should be the price that I'm expecting
the GTX 1060 super jet stream to cost
around $250 I wouldn't imagine pallette
were charged more than a 10 to 20 dollar
premium for this model it'll be
interesting to see if palette or any
other poorer partner comes up with a
more crazy 1060 design one that
increases power phase design further and
includes not one but two PCIe power
connectors still given the 1060 is meant
to be a cost-effective mid-range product
and is already under pressure from AMD
Tsar X 480 it's unlikely we'll see many
extreme versions of the 1060 overall I
really like the palette gtx 1060 super
jet stream the dual fans are nice and
quiet the design looks great and the
inclusion of a full sized backplate was
a welcomed addition what did you guys
