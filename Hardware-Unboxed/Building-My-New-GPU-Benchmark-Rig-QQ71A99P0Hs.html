the channel we have mixed feelings
because unfortunately we are retiring a
valued member of the team a member who
is put in a serious amount of time and
effort into gathering the benchmark
results for us or at least with me I am
of course talking about our trusty core
i7 6700k test machine but on the flip
side the good news is we will be
introducing a new test machine I built
this thing back in 2015 and it's served
us very well in that time and
technically it could go on serving us
but I think it probably deserves a break
from being the go-to ring to test GPUs
and what not and now with the new core
i7 77k out and about I think it's the
perfect time to upgrade our main test
rig and as it turns out our friends over
at Corsair completely agree
coincidentally the 6700 K test machine
ended up inside the Corsair Carbide 600
C computer case and inside you'll find
the original Hydro series h 100 i
all-in-one liquid cooler along with 32
gigabytes of vengeance red LED ddr4 3200
memory
rounding out the build was cooler
masters v1000 power supply Samsung's SSD
850 pro 2 terabyte SSD and as rocks
fatalities at 170 game in k-6 Plus
motherboard for our new test system
Corsair wanted us to use one of their
cases again and not just any old case
they've sent over the crystal series 570
X mid tower and this thing is just
awesome it's wrapped in timber glass but
you'll you'll get a good look at that in
a moment
and not stopping there they've also sent
over some of their vengeance LED memory
their H 100 I've version 2 cooler we've
got the MP 500 SSD there we've also got
the Force Ali SSD and the our MX 750
watt power supply about the only thing
they couldn't supply us with was the
motherboard and of course the CPU but
not to worry I do have as rocks very
awesome Zed 270 Taichi motherboard on
hand for the build so now that I have
everything I need let's get to it and
put this new test machine together the
crystal series
five 70 X is a beautiful-looking case
and I really don't think there are many
that could argue otherwise the thermal
performance is also quite good as are
the included features as you might
expect being that this is a corsair case
the build quality is excellent
throughout and although it's not a huge
case there is plenty of room inside for
high-end hardware and extra gear such as
radiators for example azrog z2 70 Taichi
motherboards slaughtered perfectly into
the five 70 X and already we look to
have the foundations of a seriously
cool-looking build I pre-installed the
core i7 77 ok processor and this was
done so we could skip this step next I
clipped in those for vengeance LED
memory modules giving the system a total
memory capacity of 32 gigabytes since we
are going with a blue white and black
themed build here Corsair has sent along
their blue LED memory and I can't wait
to see how it looks all powered up
before I can do that though we need to
install a few other components and next
up we have the hydro Series H 100 IV 2
having used the original model in our
6700k test system this is probably the
way I would have gone anyway even if
Corsair didn't send it along priced at
100 u.s. or 150 Yazzie the H 100 IV 2 is
very competitively priced for now I'm
going to install the 240 millimeter
radiator on the top of the 570 X rather
than the front and I might have to see
of course there can provide a few more
of their RGB LED fans to replace the
stock H 100 I fans moving on I dropped
in the RM 750 X 750 watt power supply
since this is a fully modular unit it
makes this job about as easy as it gets
I like the carbide 600 CE that I'm
coming from the 570 ex houses the PSU
and the bottom of the case and this is
the preferred method by enthusiasts the
570 X features the PSU cover with
backlit Corsair branding and this helps
neaten things up for those wondering the
RM 750 X is an 80 plus gold certified
power supply featuring 100% Japanese 105
degrees Celsius capacitors and it costs
a hundred u.s. or 120 Aussie now that we
have the power supply installed nor
hooked up let's drop in the storage the
Corsair force MP 500 480 gigabyte SSD
slots in a place quickly and easily
thanks to its support of the m2 form
factor the Zed 270 taiichi offers three
slots so take your pick I went with a
top slot above the primary PCIe x 16
slot then the remaining SSD which is a
2.5 inch SATA model was loaded into one
of the tool free cages on the backside
of the motherboard tray the 4 cell a4 80
gigabyte looks pretty cool here behind
the tempered glass panel now it's just a
matter of installing a graphics card and
this is the one component that will be
changed on a regular basis in our
corsair test system for the maiden
voyage that is the trip from the studio
here to the upstairs office I will
install gigabytes gtx 1080
extreme gaming as much as I love the old
test system I think this new version
while technically no faster all thanks
to kb legs an impressive IPC gains it
certainly does look the part i think you
guys will agree of course the aesthetics
of a test system aren't terribly
important because i'll be mostly just
pulling hardware out and sticking new
hardware in but i think right now at
this point in time it does look pretty
swanky for now at least i have decided
to continue running this system at the
same four point 5 gigahertz operating
frequency as I did with the 6700k
skylake system it is possible to run at
4.8 to 4.9 gigahertz and at those
frequencies that did appear quite stable
but the issue is temperatures even with
that corsair hydro all-in-one liquid
cooler in place temps were quickly
shooting up above 90 degrees I think for
the most part it's at around 92 but did
reach 96 degrees at times and in my
opinion that's a bit too hot for a test
system could compromise stability even
though I didn't see any evidence of that
just yet but yeah just too hot for a
system that's pretty much turned off or
it's on being stress tested as in
benchmarking and yeah I really just
can't afford to risk the system crashing
at all stability issues in that with
benchmarking it just makes it too much
of a pain in the backside so 4.5
gigahertz it is for an hour on that note
though I do plan to deal with the 77 or
okay processor in the system very soon
and when I do that I'll reevaluate the
temperatures and then the speeds that I
think I can safely run the system at
more long-term but for now using the
stock settings it did idle just 28
degrees which is good but that's just
the idle tab under load
run a bit too hot in my opinion at 72
degrees I mean that's certainly safe but
hotter than I was expecting for
out-of-the-box performance with a really
good liquid cooler installed and I don't
think that temperature is anyway
reflecting poorly on the the cool the
Corsair liquid cooler or the case
because that's pretty much the best
temperature I've seen with this chip
using other you know liquid cools and
things that sort of hovers around the
mid-70s anyway so the 77 okay just
appears to be a hot chip
so hopefully deal letting it can help
there anyway a big THANK YOU to Corsair
for supplying all the gear that made
this build possible and really
appreciate them sending over all that
you know hardware the case the cool high
storage power supply all that good stuff
and I hope they're just as generous when
it comes time to build my rise and test
systems shortly on that bombshell I'm
your host Steve and I hope to catch you
on the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
