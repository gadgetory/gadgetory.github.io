are checking out the gigawatt GTX 1662 a
gaming OC so what that means is we will
be pulling the card apart to check out
the cooler and see what makes it tick
have a close look at the PCB and all
that sort of stuff however before I did
pull the card apart I recorded things
like thermal performance and
overclocking so tearing down the card
hasn't had an impact on those results
but before we take a close look at the
card let's get the dirty business of
money out of the way so the MSRP for the
1662 is $200 u.s. and right now gigabyte
does have a dual fan a windforce OSI
model selling for the suggested price
the triple fan gaming OSI model that
were obviously looking at today that
comes in at a slight price premium it's
$30 u.s. and honestly that's really not
that bad in fact compared to the
competition I'd say it's rather good
firstly it's the cheapest trilithon gtx
1660 TI available at the time of making
this video it's $10 cheaper than the MSI
gaming X model that we used for our day
one coverage at thirty five dollars less
than the Isuzu triple fan strict version
gigabyte also offers an origin for three
hundred and ten dollars and it would be
interesting to see how much better that
version is for the $10 markup right now
though the gigabyte GTX 1660 TI gaming
OC looks to be the best value option by
some margin so I really keen to see what
it can do externally it looks very
similar to the RT X 2060 version in fact
in terms of dimensions they are
identical though under the skin they are
also quite different
the most obvious giveaway to this is the
weight whereas the RT X 2060 model tip
the scales at 810 grams the newer but
cheaper GTX 1660 Ti version weighs in at
just six hundred and seventy grams
making it 20% lighter the bulk of this
extra weight can be found when looking
at the coolers the cooler on the GTX
1660 Ti has three heat pipes opposed to
four of the RT x 2060 version and the RT
X 2060 cooler also has a bigger GPU
baseplate additionally some of the
weight cutting can also be attributed to
these
Moeller PCB which doesn't stretch the
entire length of the cooler instead
while the card measures 280 millimeters
from end to end the PCB measures just
225 millimeters and this is likely the
same PCB used by the dual fan models in
fact I'm fairly certain it is all sub
$300 u.s. models from gigabyte make use
of the same four plus two-phase vrm
meanwhile the Auris version that I spoke
of earlier gets an upgraded 6 + 2 phase
VRM but all models do feature the same 8
pin PCIe power connector those of you
wondering the vrm along with half a
dozen GDD are six memory chips are
cooled via the main heatsink and are
connected via aluminium plates moving
around to the backside of the card we do
find a full-length backplate though be
aware it is made from plastic so it
won't aid in cooling if anything it'll
actually just trap hot air on the
backside of the PCB still for those of
you who prefer a backplate look it will
satisfy your I guess and it does at
least protect the backside of the card
from your more ham-fisted builders let's
say then around at the i/o panel there's
three display ports along with a single
HDMI port and this is a pretty standard
configuration for these cards ok I think
that's enough going over the card itself
it's time to finally test it out as
usual with our graphics card for reviews
the focus is on operating temperatures
power consumption and overclocking I'll
still touch on the outer box performance
but I'll do so in just a few games
there's really no need to benchmark more
than a select few games first off I
wanted to see how hot the gaming OSI
model got out of the box so as usual I
fired up F 1 2018 around the canned
benchmark on a loop for an hour with an
ambient air temperature of 21 degrees
the card maxed out at just 62 degrees
and that's 5 degrees cooler than the
gaming X model but two degrees warmer
than your sous model though it's
actually three degrees warmer than a
Souza's card as that was measured with a
room temperature of 22 degrees
you'll also notice an f1 2018 that the
core clock hovered from 1935 to 1950
megahertz and that is the typical
operating frequency seen across a number
of titles this is also the same
frequency that the msi and a sous models
operated at as for the GDD r6 memory I
measured a peak surface temperature of
just 66 degrees using k-type
thermocouple
while the vrm MOSFET speak to just 61
degrees both are relatively low
temperatures so the cooler is doing a
good job here okay time for some games
and first that we have shadow of the
Tomb Raider and here the gtx 660ti
gaming OC matched the asou and msi gtx
1660 to our models and yeah it matched
them exactly so all three tested models
rendered 58 FPS on average at 1440p not
much more to say here really so let's
move on to strange Brigade okay here we
see a slight variation in performance
though all results are within the margin
of error we're talking about a maximum
of two fps between the slowest and
fastest of the gtx 660ti cards that
we've tested in this video and that
equates to just shy of a 3% difference
since I typically ignore anything less
than 5% there isn't much to talk about
here either and finally we have Forza
horizon 4 and here we have another
example of why I only test AIB cards
with three games frankly one would
really do it once again we see nothing
outside of the margin of error comparing
the MSI a Seuss and gigabyte GTX 1660 to
our models overall performance was good
at 1440p so I think it's time to move on
and do some overclocking for the
overclocking portion of the video I used
the msi afterburner utility and things
went really well the card accepted plus
110 for the core and plus 1500 for the
memory and then the power and temp
limits were maxed out this resulted in a
typical operating frequency of 2070
megahertz for the core and eighteen
hundred and seventy-five megahertz to
the memory there afterburner reports the
DDR speed of 7500 and one megahertz in
short this is the best overclocking
result I've received from any of the gtx
1660 TI graphics cards that i've tested
yet and that includes the assessor's
Strix version this meant on average the
Bruce clock was increased by 7% and the
GDD are 6 memory by 25% retesting was
shut off the Tomb Raider we found this
overclocked booster performance by 9
percent which is pretty typical for a
GTX 16 60 TI overclocked based on what
we've seen from the msi and of soos
models already the overclocked also saw
the GPU temperature max out at just 67
degrees there I could now just hear the
fans over the case fans
so it wasn't soup
but you could now just hear the graphics
card overall a solid overclocking again
this is the best I've seen from a GTX
1662 I yet though your mileage will no
doubt very given silicon quality and all
that and just lastly wrapping up the
testing I have some quick power
consumption numbers this is total system
consumption and we're testing in this
standard GPU test rig which uses a core
I 999 okay clocked at five gigahertz
with 32 gigabytes of ddr4 memory the
gigabyte gtx 1660 TI gaming XO c uses a
fraction more power than the msi honest
zeus models but overall consumption is
pretty much we'd expect it to be well
there you have it in terms of
performance the gigabyte gtx 1662 own
gaming OC it performs exactly like every
other 1660 CI that we've seen to date at
least when comparing them in terms of
framerate performance however we do tend
to see a bit of a difference when
comparing the various AIB models in
terms of operating temperatures
sometimes even overclocking Headroom
though I wouldn't read too much into
that as that will vary between cards
temperatures not as much and yeah anyway
that was the case here basically the
biggest difference we saw between the
msi gigabyte and a su smiles we've
looked at so far apart from the physical
design is the operating temperature the
MSI gaming X and a soos ROG Strix OC
were also very quiet and thankfully this
was also true for the gigabyte gaming OC
that said whereas the MSI card hit 67
degrees the gigabyte model max that at
just 62 degrees and that meant it was
just a few degrees warmer than the asou
Strix version and I feel that is a
really good result
the big advantage this gigabyte model
has over the more expensive MSI and a
soos cards apart from the fact that it
is indeed cheaper is the dual slot
design both MSI and a soos went with a
factorable slot cooler to achieve the
temperatures that they did but gigabyte
and managed to do it with a slim dual
slot cooler and then just quickly
getting back to the price at $300 at 7%
over the MSRP but I expect that premium
to be well worth it as the dual and
single fan models will run hotter and
louder meanwhile both MSI and a soos are
charging more for their high tier models
and with the gigabyte masseuse versions
being so similar in terms of thermal
performance I'd really struggle to
justify spending extra money on the
Strix card as nice as it is sorry for me
the gigabyte gaming OC is the best value
gtx 1660 to a available right now really
does offer the perfect balance of price
and performance having said all that let
