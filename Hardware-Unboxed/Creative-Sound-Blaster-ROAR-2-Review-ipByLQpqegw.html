I'm your host Matt and today we're
taking a look at creative soundblaster
raw to creatives first edition of the
Sound Blaster roar was extremely well
received in an already fairly saturated
portable bluetooth speaker market
creative somehow crammed room-filling
rich audio into a small asleep package
the first time around and the good news
today is that the design team has
managed to deliver that same audio
quality into an even smaller and lighter
package with the sound blaster roar - to
be exact the bra - is 20% smaller and
10% lighter than its predecessor and
this time around we've got a choice of
either white or black in what is a much
more attractive design at $230 the MSRP
is a little higher than that which the
original roar carried upon release
although both can be had significantly
cheap and then both of these figures
online as I mentioned the bra - comes in
at 20% smaller than the original it's
just 188 millimeters long 109
millimeters wide and 51 millimeters
thick the quick control buttons right
along the gray strip at the top of the
unit starting with the power button
volume down and up and then a
multi-function button for activating the
Bluetooth and answering and ending calls
next to this there's a small wire LED
indicator that lets you know when
bluetooth is active looking further
along this gray strip there are four
more small LEDs one red one that
indicates when the device is recording
and three green battery level indicators
lastly the NFC label shows you where you
can use near-field communication to
connect with your smartphone or other
NFC enabled devices at the rear of the
raw - you'll find the rest of the
connectivity and control buttons and
ports the connectivity first you have a
DC inputs to power in charge of the
device with the supplied adapter and a
three-and-a-half millimeter jack for
aux-in
next in line there's a female USB 2 port
which allows you to charge devices such
as smartphones through the built-in
battery a micro USB to import allows
users to charge this battery using a
standard micro USB charger then finally
we have a micro SD card slot so you can
play media from removing
storage at the other end of the unit you
can find all the remaining buttons and
controls a small switch allows you to
toggle between USB and Mass Storage
playback from the SD card board and back
buttons allow you to scroll through
tracks and a play/pause button allows
you to do just that
a start recording button play pause
recording button and enable/disable mics
which allow you to control the recording
functions using the built-in microphone
lastly the raw button allows you to
enable the raw and Terra based audio
enhancements overall the design is quite
simple sleek and consistent the front
cover is ventilated still while the rest
of the unit is constructed from plastic
that feels and looks very nice the
chassis is rigid thanks to its one-piece
design minimizing any rattles from
vibrations and the bottom of the unit
features two long rubber feet that
create a nice cushion between the raw
and whichever surface it may be sitting
on emblazoned with the creative logo to
side firing base radiators pulsate with
the base during music playback and this
is probably the coolest part of the
overall design now let's take a look at
the internals creative have informed us
that the same 5 high performance drive
is featured in the original raw have
been carried over to the new raw -
meaning inside we have two 1.5 inch
far-field high frequency tweeters along
with a single two and a half inch active
high excursion driver or subwoofers
creative call it the final 2 speaker
drivers creative refer to with the side
firing base radiators which are actually
non-powered passive radiators these help
to deliver space filling base
tremendously while still keeping the
package nice and small the raw button on
the unit unleashes creatives Terra based
feature which cleverly compensates the
loss of loudness and bass during low
level playback this means the device
will intelligently increase the loudness
of the bass that low to medium levels
until the master volume is near at
maximum output where this processing
will stop I found terabytes worked
really well and provided much more rich
and dense sound especially when I was
using outside in open environments when
using the raw - I didn't really find a
time when I didn't want the raw button
toggled on perhaps the only time I could
think I would be if you're listening to
music in bed as you fall asleep and want
some soft music at very low volume the
overall audio quality this portable Blu
speaker delivers is truly impressive
with the tera bass enhancement the bra -
provides really great performance at all
volume ranges and is especially
remarkable at higher volumes for its
size and weight for anything under $200
it's really great value and you
certainly won't be disappointed with the
sound or range of features that it
provides thanks for watching another
