it been a long long four weeks
day one impressions were good though
early testing hiccups aside productivity
performance right out of the gate was
exceptional so much so that we ditched
Tim's old
Intel editing rig and rather than go
with a broad well II CPU like I did with
my system almost a year ago now we opted
for the much more sensible Verizon 7
1700 so why is it been a long four weeks
I hear you ask well in a word gaming yes
Rises gaming performance isn't quite as
amazing as the productivity stuff when
compared to Intel's KB Lake and broad
well EC if you use that said it's
certainly not bad either as noted in my
initial Rison review these AMD CPUs
deliver an incredibly smooth gaming
experience some games work better than
others and we did find the odd title
where Rison was taking the fight to
Intel and even beating them still with
gaming somewhat underwhelming and
productivity so overwhelmingly
impressive the internet went to
hyperdrive to try and find out why
fingers are pointed the Windows 10
scheduler motherboard bios's Windows 10
updates SMT Rison CCX design ddr4 memory
and most recently in videos GPUs the
Windows 10 scheduler turned out not to
be an issue and this was confirmed by
AMD themselves it's true that the
pre-release BIOS versions did have some
performance issues but by the time Rison
landed in the hands of consumers those
were all sorted at least on the half
dozen or so various motherboards I have
there also hasn't been a magical Windows
10 update quietly pushed out that
improves performance in videos decks 12
implementation does appear to be causing
performance issues for horizon though I
believe this is an optimization issue
given that it doesn't impact Intel at
the same clock speed anyway this is
something we'll have to watch over the
coming weeks now ddr4 memory is the big
one rumor has it Rison responds really
well to faster memory unusually so I'm
told because the way it ties in with the
Infinity fabric I have heard claims that
running ddr4 3,600 memory enables Rison
7 CPUs to overtake the Kouros
and seventy-seven okay in a number of
games even with the kb lake chip heavily
overclocked that's pretty incredible if
true unfortunately getting ddr4 3,600
memory to work with Rison right now is
extremely difficult and even if you do
manage this difficult feat you are
likely going to be met with a whole host
of technical issues issues such as cold
boot failures for example the good news
is ddr4 3,200 is now pretty easy to
achieve with the right memory and
motherboard providing you do have the
right gear it's very stable and doesn't
suffer any reliability issues previously
testing on this channel was conducted
using ddr4 29:33 memory so how much
difference does low latency ddr4 3,200
memory make and perhaps more importantly
does relies on scale better with faster
memory than say kb lake first up we have
the most uneventful results and i
thought we might as well just get these
out of the way first evidently Mass
Effect Andromeda is GPU bound even at
1080p using the GTX 1080i with the ultra
quality settings enabled I included it
for the simple fact that this is a new
game and we have seen some nice
performance from rising in this title so
the orange bars show the rise in seven
1,800 ex clocked at four gigahertz using
various memory speeds ranging from 2133
to 3200 matched at every step of the way
is the 7700 K also at 4 gigahertz to see
how the memory scaling compares finally
for the ddr4 3200 configuration I have
also tested the 7700 K at 4.8 gigahertz
for a few reasons one is to keep the
Intel fans at bay under clocking the
7700 K even if we are interested in
comparing CPU performance gets them all
than it is the main reason I did this
though was to work out when we're
running into a GPU bottleneck more on
this shortly anyway looking at the
results we see that once Rison is paired
with ddr4 2666 memory it's pretty much
hitting full stride in this title and
the same is true for the 7700 K Deus Ex
mankind divided was tested using dx11 to
try and avoid the rise and slash in
video decks 12 issue even so performance
looks a lot worse than you would expect
to give them Rosen's productivity
performance so you have to assume some
sort of optimization work needs to be
done for this title anyway for now
that's not our concern
how does Rises memory profile
scale using ddr4 2133 memory the 7700 K
is 10% faster and that margin is
slightly reduced to 7 percent with the
ddr4 2666 memory however once we reach
ddr4 2933 things go in the complete
opposite direction and quickly now the
77 or ek is 16% faster moving the ddr4
3,200 this margin is further extended to
21% of the rise in 7 1,800 ex hits a
wall just shy of 100 FPS on average the
Intel chip wasn't done either it was
good for another 9% performance once
overclocked to 4.8 gigahertz Grand Theft
Auto 5 is getting on now but it still
taxes modern CPUs quite heavily using
ddr4 2133 memory on both CPUs we see the
7700 K delivered 16% more frames this
margin was reduced to 13% with ddr4 2666
9% with ddr4 29:33 and then just 6% with
ddr4 3200 so the faster clocked memory
is helping AMD recover ground in this
title that said if we avoid under
clocking the 7700 K and instead of
overclocked it to 4.8 gigahertz that
margin using the ddr4 3,200 memory blows
out to 27%
so while Verizon is scaling nicely with
faster memory I can't see ddr4 3,600
allowing Rison to match an overclocked
7700 K unfortunately battlefield 1 also
shows positive memory scaling for AMD
though the reason here is down to a GPU
limitation the 7700 K enjoys a 12%
advantage over Eisen when using ddr4
2133 memory though I should note that
it's only when looking at the average
frame rate the minimum frame rate
performance Verizon has always been very
good in battlefield 1 and we see that
again here anyway moving the ddr4 2666
the margin remains much the same it
reduces 11 percent but that's margin of
error stuff the margin does start to
shrink for the 29:33 configurations
though this isn't because Rison is
getting a bigger boost from the faster
memory rather it's because the 7700 K is
now finding the limits of the gtx 980ti
and 163 FPS moving the ddr4 3200 the
7700 K is now seriously GPU bound and
this allows the 1,800 X to catch up as
the
tell CPU is now just 4% faster proving
that we are 100% GPU bound here is the
4.8 gigahertz 7700 k configuration which
is only able to improve on the point 1
percent and 1 percent results now we
have hitman starting at ddr4 2133 the
7700 K was an average 16% faster though
I should note the minimum frame rates
were similar upping the memory speed the
2666 reduced the margin and now the 7700
K was just 11% faster yet like what was
seen in Deus Ex mankind divided Verizon
seems to run out of steam and jumping
the ddr4 29:33 provided just a few extra
frames this meant to the 7700 K was able
to pull away once again now delivering
16% more performance as we hit ddr4 3200
the 7700 K continues to pull away much
like a Mercedes with darris assist on a
Honda powered McLaren down the straight
at Monza yeah no need to check the
mirrors mafia tree has been a bit of an
AMD risin special so I wanted to make
sure it was included in this test here
we can see the rising scales quite
aggressively with memory frequency in
this tile the 7700 K was 13% faster with
ddr4 2133 10% faster with ddr4 2666 and
7% faster with ddr4 29:33 after that
though we run into another GPU
bottleneck and the showdown ends
prematurely as the 7700 K is just 4
percent faster now overclocking the 7700
Kader 4.8 gigahertz provides no extra
performance focusing on the average
frame rates we see that with ddr4 2133
memory the 7700 K is actually 3 percent
slower than the 1800 ex and watchdogs to
the 2666 and 29:33 averages are much the
same though the 7700 K does offer better
minimum frame rate performance the
margins are pretty well Nala fide at
ddr4 3200 though we could be seeing a
GPU bottleneck here as the overclocked
7700 K at 4.8 Gertz didn't really
deliver the kind of boost you would
expect it to for testing overwatch I
spectator 12-player easy BOTS match for
5 minutes using desire a hero this is a
really accurate and CPU intensive
benchmark though it does take quite a
lot of time as I do
still take the average from three runs
anyway the 7700 K was five percent
faster when using ddr4 2133 eight
percent faster with 2666 seven percent
faster with twenty nine thirty three and
seven percent fast with ddr4 thirty two
hundred so for the first time we see
fairly even memory scaling across the
board for both CPUs ashes of the
singularity escalation was tested in the
dx12 mode using the latest build
optimized for horizon here we see
something we haven't seen before
check this out using ddr4 2133 memory
the 7700 K was seven percent faster and
then just three percent faster with the
2666 memory okay so we've seen that
before but what we haven't seen is
rising hitting the lead with ddr4 29:33
memory the 7700 k is now two percent
slower
finally with ddr4 3,200 memory 277 okay
is now seven percent slower and
therefore the 1,800 ex enjoys a seven
percent performance advantage it is
possible for the 7700 k to reclaim the
lead once overclocked but that's not
really what we're interested in for this
test before wrapping things up I just
wanted to see how much of an impact my
shiny new g.skill Flair Excel 14 memory
was having on performance some of you
have told me that Rison doesn't respond
that well to memory timings and was
instead more responsive to memory
frequency although i did only test one
game in ashes of the singularity this
does appear to be true granted this
isn't conclusive evidence but I would
have thought performance would start to
fall away once you start using CL 20
timings if Rison was timing sensitive so
as always with Rison we found some
interesting results based on my findings
it looks like Rison does indeed perform
better with faster memory not really a
shocker though is it in fact for the
most part rise and scales fairly
typically when compared to the KB like a
core i7 7700 K games such as over what
shows similar scaling across the board
when comparing Rison and KB Lake pretty
much what I was expecting to see I then
saw some strange behavior in Deus Ex
mankind divided and a hitman where the
1800 X briefly caught up when moving
from ddr4 2133 to 2666 but then fell
well behind when increasing the memory
speed further
there is clearly something else limiting
risings performance in these titles
Rison did scale very nicely in grand
theft auto 5 and with ddr4 3200 it did
close the gap on the 7700 okay to be
just 5 percent slower it's possible with
ddr4 3600 memory that the 1800 ex could
have matched the 77 okay with both CPUs
clocked at 4 gigahertz but I can't
really see it winning by anything more
than what would fall under the margin of
error heading that said we did see the
1800 X take charge and ashes of the
singularity escalation at least with
both CPUs clocked at 4 gigahertz again
this wasn't really a CPU comparison
rather 77 RK was included to see if
Rison does scale better with faster
memory in relation to an Intel CPU in
ashes it certainly does coming from 6
FPS down to lead by 7 FPS at the same
clock speed like most things we've
tested so far pertaining to risings
performance memory frequency isn't a
silver bullet it certainly helps to
maximize horizons performance no doubt
about that
but it doesn't always help catch the
speedy Intel quad cores to say that
arming rising with ddr4 3,600 memory
will see at match room and beat the 7700
K in most games is a massive stretch so
as I've been saying for a few weeks now
the real gains are going to be seen via
software updates namely game
optimizations like what we've seen
recently with ashes of the singularity
escalation AMD has a heap of game
developers in their back pocket thanks
to their console connections so I expect
future triple-a titles to work much
better with the rise and CPUs than those
we currently have and hopefully we'll
see this in the not-too-distant future
well that's all for this one guys I hope
you enjoyed the benchmarks if you did
hit that like button for me I appreciate
the support as always I enjoy hearing
from you guys
so drop a comment below and also do not
forget we have that insane
custom-built rise and so an 1800 X
gaming system giveaway running at the
moment you slap a little over two weeks
to enter if you haven't done so already
but yeah
why wait do it now right I don't know
guys I'm the Irish save a catchy ginseng
