specialized peripherals for gamers of
all kinds from FPS action games to
murder and RTS they aim to deliver the
ultimate gaming solutions especially
with their mice companies have tried in
the past deliver a mouse that works for
all gamers and today's featured rocket
net is no different the niche design is
somewhat staggering featuring a grand
total of 18 buttons it includes 12 side
thumb buttons and rockets unique to
directional dorsal fin up top this
interesting little paddle is pretty
nifty and can be handily use for side
scrolling forward and back or
intuitively leaning around corners and
first-person shooters the other unique
button up top is rockets easy shift plus
button which told was a secondary set of
commands for the nips button set and
will suit the Rainman type user you can
handle in excess of 30 commands
underneath there by hand customization
is whether it really comes into its own
in its default configuration the Nith
features 12 thumb keys as mentioned this
side panel can be completely customized
and when I say completely I mean it in
your standard nith package you get 12
individual small thumb keys 6 larger
thumb keys and 3 long strips that
deactivate the entire row you can plug
these into the inside side panel as you
see fit and then customize the functions
in the rocket software I'm happy to
report the swapping these keys out is
relatively easy and once they're in they
don't feel shaky or fall out easily
beyond the customizable keys rocket have
included a hot swappable side piece that
extends the body of the needs to be
wider suiting users that prefer a palm
group now just when you thought I was
finished describing the customization of
the NIR there's yet another level rocket
have provided a 3d print library through
shape ways where you can order different
button layouts and we plugged in as a
custom side piece including a plain
button list design that you can stick
your nickname on you can also directly
download the designs for free and print
them
your own 3d printer or at a 3d print
shop performance-wise the nipple was
just what you'd expect from any high-end
gaming mouse especially one from rocket
I'm not much of a mobile gamer but it's
obvious how the side buttons could be
used and they were actually pretty handy
in first-person shooters such as Rainbow
six siege where you're able to use
gadgets and switch directly to weapons
without moving your left hand off the
waste keys the NIP utilizes rockets
swarm software where you can customize
everything even further the RGB LEDs can
be customized to any color and a few
different lighting effects adjust dpi
sensitivity anywhere from 200 dots to
12,000 sync up with alien FX lighting
and even track statistics in the swarm
mobile app all 18 buttons can be
competed in any way that your heart
desires to as expected granted some of
this is fluff but it's great to see
rocket pushing the boundaries a little
and being quite creative all-in-all the
NIF is an exciting addition to rocket
smash lineup and certainly will satisfy
those that like to tweak play and
customize their peripherals your options
are basically limitless with this Mouse
and you can even copy the config of some
of your favorite rocket team member
heroes such as League of Legends player
Tian and Diablo 3 specialist Conrad
don't see the links in the description
I think mor MOBA games especially will
love the customization of this high and
mouse and coming in at $99 on Amazon
rocket we'll be hoping that they do as I
mentioned earlier it's great to see
companies continuing to push the
boundaries without gaming peripherals
and I'll look forward to seeing more of
what Rocket has in store in the future
