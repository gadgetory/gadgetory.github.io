your host Matt and today we're looking
at course there's new h100 IG DX cooler
the H 100 IG DX is the latest and
greatest closed-loop design in their
Hydro series extreme performance cooling
line and big brother to the best-selling
H 100 iget with a brand new cooling
block and updated aesthetics it features
a double wide 240 millimeter radiator
and two PWL controlled fans which should
be plenty to dissipate all that nasty
heat before we take a look at
performance and find out let's open up
the box and take a look all righty so up
top we've got little warranty guide
instruction manual and a thin layer of
white foam these here the two 120
millimeter fans you can actually control
the fan speed manually with the corsair
link digital software in the box reports
let's spin up to about 2400 RPM here
we've got the big 240 ml radiator which
fits the 220 millimeter fans we've got
screw holes on both sides so if you've
got room in your case you can do
push-pull fan mounting attach the two
flexible black rate of cooling hoses
which feel really nice and soft as
you'll see these actually go directly
into the cooling block this does seem a
bit clunky but they do twist around
pretty easily then you've just got the
fan power cords attached we go into what
is the right side of the cooling block
now the cooling block itself looks
pretty snazzy though it's nice Corsair
emblem on top and there is an RGB LED
underneath which you can actually
control the color and the corsair
digital link software if we take a look
at the bottom
you notice it's actually around now
finally in this packet we've got the
modular mounting brackets for both Intel
and AMD sockets
as well as the USB cable so you can link
up to the Corsair software for our
benchmarks we ran that H 100 IG DX on
performance mode which never actually
spun the fans up any higher than 2100
rpm we tested the H 100 IG DX on a core
i7 4790k and idle the system ran it just
24 degrees and that was in an ambulatory
x' you comparison the Intel stock pool
around at 34 degrees so a pretty big
difference and for those interested the
previous h100 igt model ran at 27
degrees under full load using prime95
for 20 minutes the GTX got up to only 61
degrees which is considerably better
than the 69 degrees the H 100 I ran it
not to mention the 90-plus degree is
that standard Intel cooler allowed the
4790 to hit we really liked the easy
installation of the H 100 i GTX and it's
good to see that performance is really
good across the board not just as the
fans spinning at their full at loud 2400
rpm performance wise it was a slight
step up from the H 100 Ã¬get but whether
or not it's worth the extra money that's
up to you to decide what I can say
however is the G DX certainly is one of
the best all-in-one liquid cool is that
you can buy thanks for watching harbor
unboxed i'm your host Matt if you like
the products as much as we did hit like
hit subscribe and we'll see you next
time yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
