right guys you've been hounding me since
late last week to benchmark the Windows
10 for creators update so that's what
we're gonna do I spent the last few days
benchmarking and getting all the data
for this video but unfortunately most of
it I won't actually bother showing you
guys because it's very uninteresting ok
so a quick recap on what's happened so
far early this year Microsoft here's
with what they called the creators
update for Windows 10 and part of this
update included a feature called game
mode which was designed to ensure the
operating system was focused on
delivering the best possible performance
for gamers and I did this by disabling
non-critical processors to free up
resources given that that's all it
really did those using modern hardware
game mode didn't really offer anything
performance remained exactly the same
Brian over at tech yes City did a nice
little video on this feature and found
that if you're running a dirty old
potato gaming rig then under certain
conditions the game mode did help smooth
out frame rates and improve performance
so technically it did work it just
wasn't as amazing as someone hoped now
Microsoft has recently just released a
new update the full creator update which
has brought about a few tweaks to the
game mode that as far as I'm aware
Microsoft hasn't really made any
performance claims here but still as
usual that hasn't stopped the internet
from creating rumors and getting all
excited and making a few bold claims
even here in the harbor unbox comment
sections I've seen a few users claiming
massive performance gains you know
upwards of 10 15 even 20 FPS more in
games that said though there were just
as many probably more of you that said
it made no difference at all if I don't
have time to test myself I generally
look to other trusted sources to see
what they found there have been a few
reports so far from those that have
tested the update the most controversial
of which I'd have to say is a video by
Joker Productions which showed massive
truly massive gains on a core i7 semi
7rk system using a veil 56 graphics card
at 1440p just one of the six games
tested that was Batman Arkham Knight
showed no performance uplift while games
such as Rainbow six
siege saw an insane 26% increase in
frame rate I have to admit to me this
didn't seem possible and if I came
across the numbers like this I'd do a
serious amount of digging it just seems
too good or too implausible to be true
having had this video spammed to me by
all you guys wanting me to do a
follow-up video I decided I would take a
look while I was benchmarking and
investigating reinstalling Windows
updating windows on a number of
different systems to try and work out
what was going on
LHD ville long-haired steve published an
article titled windows 10 full craters
update rising benchmark CPU bound and in
that he showed no performance gains from
the update frankly this is really what I
was expecting a fine but we have one
source now claiming a twenty percent on
average gain and another claiming zero
it has to be said that both source has
really only tested a limited hardware
configurations but this should really
tell us all we need to know still with
Joker testing a core i7 77 okay with
Vega 56 in gamers Nexus testing horizon
7 1700 CPU with a GTX 1082 I decided to
test a range of CPUs with Vega 64
liquid-cooled
since joke I found big gains with Vega
and I'd just done a heap of Vega 64
liquid-cooled testing I thought this is
the way I'd go that said that I should
just note that I did also do some
testing with the GTX 1080i and found
yeah much the same as what I'm about to
show you before we get to the benchmark
graphs let's just check some
side-by-side gameplay footage using some
canned benchmarks as they're generally a
bit more accurate for this kind of thing
please note the data in the graph shown
later in the video are based on an
average of three runs
obviously the side-by-side stuff is just
showing framerate data from a single run
so there will be a little more variance
there I'm also measuring the data using
different software for the graphs the
previous version of Windows 10 was
tested with the game mode enabled which
has no impact on the results disabled
you'd get the same figures the following
data for the full crater update is with
the game mode off but I did also test
with it enabled on a per game basis and
I found any the reduced performance all
the results were just the same first up
we have Rainbow six siege and here the
frame rates look much the same
before and after the update these
side-by-side comparisons have been done
using the core i5 8600 k and vega 64
liquid core graphics card there's a
little back and forth but overall the
update was about 2 FPS faster on average
from this individual run but i'll
compare the 3 run average soon something
I noticed apart from the fact that we
were at best seen just a 1 to 2 percent
performance improvement is the fact that
CPU utilization was constantly lower
after the update after around 10% lower
so that's certainly very interesting and
it could point to systems with weaker
CPUs seeing some kind of gain not 20%
gains but gains all the same next up we
have Warhammer 2 and here the frame
rates are virtually identical before and
after the update I was using the DirectX
12 API with the high quality preset here
honestly there wasn't even a frame in it
but again the CP utilization was quite a
bit lower after the update so again I
hope those running older systems may see
some sort of performance improvement for
the most part frame rates remained much
the same in the division and here I was
again using the DirectX 12 API CPU
utilization was slightly lower began
performance with the 80 600k was pretty
much the same with the full crater
update finally the last side-by-side was
recorded with Deus Ex mankind of Ireland
here performance was unchanged from the
previous Windows 10 build even the CP
utilization was much the same here so
not much to report on alright so time
for some graphs and well there really
isn't much to discuss here so I'm just
gonna breeze through these really
quickly like I said previously I did a
lot more testing than the stuff I'm just
showing you here but it's all very
repetitive and boring Rainbow six siege
at 720p is pretty much margin of error
stuff same is true at IEP and finally at
1440p we again find a very similar story
total war Warhammer two was much the
same at 720p pretty much exactly the
same at 1080p in exactly the same at
1440p so that was a rather uneventful
again something interesting I found was
that with the game mode enabled the full
credit actually reduced performance in
the games I tested his Rainbow six siege
as an example here I saw up to a 7%
reduction in performance with the game
mode enabled I also tried close
in the game after enabling the game mode
reloading the game and then checking the
performance over again and also
confirming that game mode was turned on
and yes every single time without fail
the game was slightly slower with the
game mode turned on so I'm not quite
sure what's going on there well they
have it if your system was running
correctly with the previous Windows 10
build then after installing the new full
crater update you should be looking at
very similar performance it's possible
that those running quad-core CPUs maybe
the 7600 K for example you might see
some improve performance there in CPU
intensive titles such as battlefield 1
but you won't say anything like 20%
improved performance at least I can't
imagine you would I'd say somewhere
around maybe up to 10% gains could be
seen due to the reduced CPU usage as I
just alluded to if you are seeing
massive performance gains or even a
really strong performance gains there is
a chance there was probably something
wrong we set up previously I wouldn't
rule out all performance gains but
you're not going to see up to 20% from
this update unless a lot of other media
outlets start reporting that but I don't
think it's going to be the case so you
can which though I am keen to see some
other media outlets do this sort of
testing to see what kind of results they
dig up for now though at least I have
confirmed the results gamers Nexus
published and I did that with different
Hardware not sure if they're going to do
it part two where they also do very good
testing that would be kind of cool if
they do might ask Steve about that
directly and finally it would be cool if
Brian over at tech your city dug out a
few of these old bangers and looked into
seeing what kind of performance gains
there might be there that something
could be interesting you did do this
last time so go over there harass him
and you'll probably make it happen
anyway that's gonna do it for this one
I'm your host Steve see you guys again
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
