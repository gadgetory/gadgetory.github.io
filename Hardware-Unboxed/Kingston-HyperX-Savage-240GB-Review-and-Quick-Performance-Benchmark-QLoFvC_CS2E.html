boxed I'm Harris Matt and today we were
taking a peek at Kingston's
mid-range SSD the HyperX savage well
notice quick is the HyperX predator
Savage is supposed to be a significant
step up from the hyper experience Savage
is powered by fires an s10 quad-core a
channel controller and loaded with two
shades is a 19 Dan flash these
specifications shrewdest making
Kingston's faster SATA SSD today adding
up to recorded 560 megabytes per second
read 530 megabytes per second row we're
gonna be running a tweet performance
test for you a little later but for now
listen soap another box and take a look
inside alright so on top we've got the
drive itself underneath is the thickness
spacer laptops that made it really
packed underneath we've got the three
dimensions apt up with the HyperX
sticker instruction manual and
activation code and they've also thrown
in a USB external displays up pretty
handy and looks like pretty high quality
sorry cable mounting screws and what
appears to be his head so what appear to
be a pen before you'll find is actually
just the skies is one Kingston's onto
the fat and none of us actually had
arrived with a pen anymore so what this
is is actually a magnetic screwdriver
for installation let's take a look at
the USB 3 external enclosure
this would be a pretty high quality
build the bottom is plastic but we do
have a brushed aluminium finish on top
and the slightly protruding super hot
gravy sign you can also lock and unlock
the case here just slides off like so
you've also got a USB 3 cable inside now
let's take a look at the drive itself
sir it's got a nice matte black finish
over the whole Drive and then we do have
a nice red facade on the front with the
hot bricks branding in the silver it
does look pretty nice but I mean overall
it is just a standard two and a half
inch drive sir what's left to do but it
stick it in and give it a benchmark now
let's do some quick benchmarking of a
SSD benchmark speak the savage from the
drop-down list and hit stop first we
have the sequential ride tests and here
we see the savage it's very close to the
quoted 5 minute 30 megabytes per second
right hitting four ninety eight point
eight three megabytes per second
now the sequential raid and again we get
close to the advertised speed of 560
megabytes per second with 511 24 four
megabytes per second the random 4k
performance is comparable to other
high-performance
side of SSDs such as the samsung SSD 850
pro
it looks like the fork a threaded
performance is pretty comfortable -
finally we have to access time results
and we have some pretty mixed results oh
yeah
the broad access time is pretty fast and
point over five tubular seconds while
the read access time is rather slurred
for an SSD at point one seven two
milliseconds for wrapping things up I'm
going to take a quick look at the copy
benchmark hit start and watch I've
started test took just a few seconds and
diluted 437 megabytes per second the
program tests which pages many more
smaller rate writes to a bit longer that
was still managed a reasonable two
hundred fifty seven point nine one
megabytes per second
lastly the game could be benchmarked to
just four and a half seconds and fell
just short of three hundred and ten
megabytes per second so where roll looks
like the HyperX tab which is pretty good
mainstream points SSD thank you for
tuning in to another Hardware on blocks
I'm focusing in product preview his wife
he's subscribe we'll see you next time
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
