unbox we're checking out the titanfall 2
performance with a nice selection of
GPUs we have 22 on hand including the
the new 1050 and 1050 Ti graphics cards
I've stacked these all neatly here just
to show you how many cards we have
tested and I've been trying not to knock
them over but in case the testing
doesn't turn out to be that exciting
let's just do a an expensive domino
effect for those of you unaware
titanfall 2 is a hot new first-person
shooter developed by respawn
entertainment and published by
Electronic Arts this is the sequel to
2014's titanfall and like the original
it uses the source game engine the game
looks quite impressive on PC that has to
be said the recommended specifications
are quite steep the developer suggests
at least a chorus and ridore equivalent
processor and surprisingly there's no
mention of AMD's FX series as for the
graphics card they say a geforce gtx
1066 key or AMD Radeon rx 488 gigabyte
is recommended I find it interesting
that they recommend the 8 gigabyte 480
over the more cost-effective 4 gigabyte
model perhaps this suggests the games
are v rmp meanwhile for those wanting to
game at 4k the developer recommends a
core i7 6700 K coupled with the GTX 1080
so pretty run-of-the-mill stuff here
then right also for those of you
wondering titanfall 2 uses the DirectX
11 API as usual for these benchmarks
we've used our overclocked core i7 6700
K system and both AMD and NVIDIA
graphics cards were tested with their
latest drivers testing takes place at
three resolutions and we're reporting
the average and minimum frame rates from
an average of three benchmark runs each
of which lasts 60 seconds here's a quick
look at the quality settings used for
testing Before we jump to a preview of
the benchmark pass and then finally onto
the results as a side note for testing
we've set the difficulty to easy as this
makes the player next to invincible
allowing us to take the same path
through the test each time without risk
of dying
- but you're in bad shape
hobo fine knock you out you should be
okay when you wake up last the most
hostile Titans in round apex predators
copy that maintain mercenary hey down
let's go
starting with the previous generation
GPUs we find pretty solid performance at
RDP particularly given we are using near
enough to the maximum image quality
settings even the GTX 950 average forty
four fps and never dip below 34 fps for
an average of 60 FPS gamers will require
an r9 280x and for a constant 60 fps the
r9 390 will be required those gaming at
1440p you will want at least an online
380 to stay above 30 fps though a GPU
such as the r9 390 will deliver a
considerably more desirable experience
surprisingly even the gtx 980ti and fury
x couldn't stay above 60 FPS at all
times here as we know using maximum
quality settings and the latest triple-a
titles doesn't really allow for playable
performance at 4k using a previous
generation GPU here we see both the
980ti and fury x dipping below 30 fps at
times the current generation GPUs take
things for the next level while most of
them do anyway the RX 460 struggles even
at 1080p dipping down a 30 fps in both
the 2 gigabyte and 4 gigabyte flavours
the new GT x 1050 was slightly better
though the ti model is about as slow as
I would go here meanwhile we see next to
no difference between a 3 gigabyte and 6
gigabyte 1060 models but it is
interesting to note that the RX 470 is
able to match these graphics cards
jumping to 1440p gamers will require
either a gtx 1060 or our x4 70 / 4 80
all 4 produced similar performance
rendering between 54 and 58 FPS on
average if you want to stay above 60fps
at all times then it looks like the GTX
1080 is still the best solution as
suggested by the developer those wanting
to play at 4k will require the GTX 1080
or the Titan XP the latter is a nice
option if you're a Saudi prince and/or a
small youtube channel owner ok guys get
at your specs for this one as we move to
the mixed results I'm sorry about the
tiny font here I'm not sure if there's a
better way to do this but this is how I
display the results for now anyway the
results look pretty much as expected the
GTX 980 was slightly faster than the GTX
260 while the RX 470 almost matched the
r9 390x
though the minimum frame rate was a bit
lower here we see that the current and
previous generation mid-range offerings
are enough for playable performance at
1440p we probably didn't need this graph
but what the hell
it is the best possible argument for
selling a vital log and surprisingly
titanfall 2 doesn't appear all that CPU
intensive the single-player portion of
the campaign only placed around 20% load
on our overclocked core i7 processor
here we see the load is mostly spread
across four cores with the other four
doing half as much work for those of you
thinking it'll be a totally different
story in the multiplayer portion of the
game well we have good news for those
rockin low-end CPUs for the most part
CPU utilization again hovered around the
20% mark though at times that climbed as
high as 30% albeit very briefly before
wrapping things up let's take a quick
look at how the RX 488 gigabyte compares
with the GTX 10 63 gigabyte yes the 3
gigabyte model we have already seen the
benchmark results so we know the numbers
but I thought it'd be interesting to see
how the 3 gigabyte model performs in
comparison to an 8 gigabyte card testing
does take place at 1080p but similar
margins were again seen at 1440p as you
can see despite the game allocating up
to an over 4 gigabytes of vram this
didn't seem to hinder the 3 gigabyte
1060 the image quality wasn't scaled
back either like what was seen in Gears
of War 4 at least not to the point where
I could notice in our benchmark for
those wondering the MSI gaming X
versions of each graphics card were
featured in this test
you sick bastard well there you have it
guys titanfall 2 appears very well
optimized it certainly doesn't require a
monstrous GPU for playable performance
of resolution such as 1080p or even
1440p for that matter the demand on the
CPU isn't particularly high either
and I suspect core i3 and even like AMD
FX or quad-core apu owners won't have
any troubles either well that's about it
from me guys I hope you enjoyed the
video and the testing was useful if you
have any feedback suggestions comments
whatever leave them below and we'll see
you on the next benchmarking adventure
so those of you that already support the
channel thank you so much it's truly
appreciated and to those of you that
would like to support the channel
directly I do have Amazon links and a
patreon link in the video description
below thanks a lot and I'll see you guys
next time
thankfully Matt's unconscious right now
I don't think you need to know about
this so we'll just keep it our own
little secret thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
