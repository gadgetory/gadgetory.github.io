all doing well unfortunately Tim is
still sick but the good news is he tells
me he's getting better
and he should be back to work very soon
in fact we are still planning to do that
live stream build tomorrow he's not a
hundred percent today but well he's not
gonna be hundred percent tomorrow either
he reckons but he'll be good enough to
do the live stream builds we're gonna be
doing that on the channel should be a
lot of fun so keep an eye on your
notifications for that line because it
won't be at the regular time anyway
because Tim is out of action we didn't
have a video ready for today's slot I've
got to benchmark videos planned about
the testings not quite done yet so yeah
no video already not a big deal though
we can just skip today or at least
that's what I thought we were going to
do while reading over your comments on
yesterday's a Seuss build video I
noticed a huge amount of people talking
about how GB SSDs and that's because I
included well partly because I included
this RGB SSD in the build video and one
of the first comments on that video
really really confused the hell out of
me basically we went along the lines of
something like the system's probably
going to be unstable because I made the
mistake of using an RGB SSD I was really
really confused by this comment I
thought the person just had to be
trolling me it was some sort of RGB meme
or something like that anyway shortly
after I just got more and more comments
about the our GB SSD that I should check
it to make sure that it wasn't running
superhot and there was some problems
with it nor this my where is this coming
from then finally someone said were you
having the same problems that J saw J
from Jay's two cents and then I thought
ok I've got to go find this video from J
went over to his channel couldn't find
it turns out it's the latest video he's
done surprise surprise just didn't have
anything to do with SSDs or RGB in the
title I guess it was meant to be a
surprise or something so the first thing
I noticed was that J wasn't even using
the same SSD he had the Kingston HyperX
fury RGB SSD yeah it's an RGB SSD but
that's about all they have in common
they use different controllers different
NAND flash memory and complete
different RGB lighting the issue Jay had
with his drive was entirely down to the
LED lighting with it disabled the drive
worked perfectly fine now the fury X
uses a staggering 75 RGB modules all of
which are mounted on the same PCB as the
storage related components and we know
this because an antique took the thing
apart and showed us what it looks like
inside basically all the lights are on
one side of the PCB while the controller
and memory are on the other
this means the vast majority of the heat
generated by these lights is absorbed
into the PCB and well that helps cook
everything else attached to it an antic
concluded their review by saying this
the LED lighting on the Kingston HyperX
fury RGB SSD drives up the price of this
SATA SSD to nvme levels and draws enough
power to make the drive more prone to
overheating than almost any m2 nvme SSD
out there and we tested with only one of
the three colour channels illuminated
Kingston's designed for this drive uses
probably twice as many LEDs as necessary
to provide the backlit logo and narrow
highlights though a lot of the light is
blocked as it passes through the
translucent plastic diffuser sheet and
metal grading something I found of
interest is the fact that an antique
didn't note the horrendous stability
issues that Jay saw but then they did
only test for the third of the lighting
enabled so probably had enough of the
LEDs disabled to avoid any major
problems that said Tom's Hardware did
tests with all the LEDs enabled and they
also didn't notice the horrendous
stability issues that Jay saw though
they did note poor performance after
moderate write and copy workloads which
does suggest a throttling issue not
super uncommon for an SSD but more so
when discussing nvme SSDs rather than
the slower two and a half inch models
housed in aluminium enclosures having
now read a few reviews from leading tech
sites
I feel Jay probably got a dud a
defective model of what is still a
rather poor product but I'm not
convinced it's as terrible as what Jay
found so while I don't think his
findings are the norm it's still a
flawed product that costs too much for
what it is and it has way way too many
LEDs if I were Jay I'd digress
no but seriously I would have pulled the
thing apart to see where the LEDs were
placed try and work out why they were
getting so hot
and just mess around with a bit check
out the internals and yet just see
what's going on I would have been really
interesting but at least an antic did
tear it down and they did give us a look
at the internals
I've watched Jays video twice now and
I'm still not showing a few things like
did he reach out to Kingston to see what
they had to say about the issue so is it
a common issue does it impact all drives
was his just effective which is what I
suspect was the case here again we know
it runs hotter than it should but I
haven't seen a single other review
complaining about Windows but Windows
not working out of curiosity I've
decided to buy one of these things we
don't have a contact at Kingston so I've
just decided to buy one the 480 gigabyte
models it's like $150 I'll see somewhere
around there so not terribly expensive
so yeah just ordered one so we can see
what the deal is I'm really mostly just
interested to see if it actually works
with all the RGB Zhan J noted that it
was particularly bad when they were all
set to white so yeah I want to see if
all the drives when set to white just
fail or have some sort of weird issue
so yeah it'd be pretty mind-blowing if
they all had that issue that J saw
surely surely there's no way Kingston
could have released a product that's
really that broken surely what I can
tell you is that me looking at this
thing won't change the fact that
Kingston's HyperX fury RGB SSD is flawed
and you should really avoid it so
regardless of my findings J is right
about that however if you want an r gb
SSD then i can highly recommend the team
group model it doesn't run hot it
doesn't suffer any stability issues and
as far as I can tell the RGB lighting on
this one is completely harmless the T
force Delta R GB SSD packs just eight
RGB LEDs and yet despite that in my
opinion it lights up better than the
Kingston model the LEDs are also on a
completely separate PCB which doesn't
come in contact with the main PCB
housing the controller DRAM cache and
NAND flash using an IR gun I measured a
peak surface temperature of just 32
degrees in a 21 degree room after a
20-minute stress test that was also
barely warm to hold though I'm not sure
if I've become desensitized to hot
surfaces after all that zeb 390 vrm
testing that i did but this SSD
certainly didn't feel warm to touch
anyway I'll just stick to using these
scientific instruments that I have at my
disposal and trust them over my touch
test pricing is also super competitive
despite the flashy RGB lighting team
groups charging just sixty-eight dollars
us for the 500 gigabyte model and for
some pricing context crucial is selling
their MX 500 500 gigabyte for seventy
dollars right now while Samsung's 860
Evo 500 gigabyte costs $80 us as for
performance it's not class leading by
any means but it's certainly not slow
either basically there's no chance
you'll notice the difference between any
of the models I just mentioned anyway I
just wanted to make this quick video to
address the crazy amount of comments I
saw bashing the team group Delta R GB
SSD because another completely unrelated
RGB SSD is hot garbage see I thought was
a bit unfair that this SSE was getting
completely bashed because of another SSD
anyway we've addressed that now this one
is perfectly fine and if you want to
flash your lookin SSD then yeah I do
recommend it but yeah RGB is on SSD is
kind of a weird one that but as we found
in the bill yes that does kind of look
cool if you can put it on display and if
you're into your RGB lighting and
whatnot anyway that's going to do it for
this one again we will have our live
stream bill tomorrow so keep an eye out
for that hopefully Tim well hopefully
he'll be doing better than the Kingston
RGB SSD you won't be throttling that
hard hopefully he's over his illness and
yeah hopefully you guys didn't mind this
sort of filler video I thought it was
interesting to cover normally this is
the kind of thing I would do as a
patreon behind-the-scenes video discuss
these kinds of issues with the patreon
embers but because this was something
that came from a main channel video and
was discussed by a lot of people that
probably aren't patreon members I
thought I would just make this video
because we had we had a free slot and
this video really didn't take me much
time or effort to make so yeah there's
that so hopefully it was still enjoyable
anyway I'll be back with some big
in-depth benchmark videos which I know
you guys love on the channel very soon I
have some pretty cool benchmarks lined
up so yeah you don't want to miss those
anyway like the video if you liked it
subscribe for more content and if you
appreciate the work we do our box then
consider supporting us on patreon and
yeah thanks for watching I'm your host
Steve see
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
