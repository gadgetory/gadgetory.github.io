member from one of kun apps latest nice
families the TS 253 a dub does an
Internet of Things centric Nath's it's
actually more than just a network
attached storage device rather I
consider the TS 253 a to be a mini
server by supporting the open source
Linux platform it allows users to
directly utilize various feature-rich
Linux apps not only that but through the
use of dual HDMI outputs users can
switch between the links desktop and kun
apps media focus HD station the HDMI
outputs also allow for the use of dual
monitors and can be configured to
display either a cloned or extended
desktop the HD station supports a range
of feature-rich apps such as Kodi HD
player Plex home theater YouTube Spotify
J River Google Chrome Mozilla Firefox
and more helping to make the TS 253 a
feel more like a dedicated multimedia
player is the bundle keynote remote
control which communicates with the
device using infrared along with the
powerful app support hardware decoding
is supported at resolutions up to 4k 4k
video transcoding is also supported
allowing users to convert videos to
Universal formats that can be smoothly
played on PCs mobile devices and smart
TVs this feature is also offered offline
as well using a pre-rendered lower
resolution video these features have all
been integrated into the latest qts 4.0
operating system which we'll take a
quick look at shortly before we do that
let's check out the TS 253 unit to see
what's what from the front we have what
I've describes an industrial looking
device that probably looks more at home
in a data center than your living room I
think the removable three and a half
inch hot-swappable drive bays mainly
they give this impression all of the
connectivity buttons and indicators are
located in a black loss strip the runs
along the left hand side of the device
here we have a USB 3 port which provides
convenient access for external storage
devices making this port even more
convenient is the quick copy button
which when configured using the qts
software can dump all the files from
external storage into a designated
folder above the quick copy button we
have the power button followed by a few
LEDs status lights indicating network
activity as well as individual drive
activity the brightness volleys
these can be adjusted to using the Qt s
software around the back we find three
USB 3 ports taking the grand total for
the device to fall and above that are
the two HDMI outputs which can be used
simultaneously interestingly we find a
line out jack along with Jools 6.3
millimeter microphone jacks for dynamic
microphones only finally we find not one
but two Gigabit Ethernet ports along
with a 70 millimeter cooling fan now
that we've taken a tour around the TS
253 a what can you expect to find inside
powering the whole operation at its
heart is the Intel Celeron and 3150
quad-core system-on-chip running at
clock speeds between 1.6 gigahertz and
2.0 8 gigahertz depending on how CPU
intensive the task is coupled with 4
gigabytes of memory this quad core
system is ready to handle some pretty
serious multitasking for those
interested the memory is upgradable and
Keena does sell an 8 gigabyte version
though it isn't very cost-effective the
type of memory uses ddr3 low voltage
running a 1600 megahertz setting up and
configuring the TS 253 a is about as
easy as it gets the setup process is
intuitive and the qts software used to
configure the device is highly refined I
won't go into too much detail regarding
the qts software for this product review
and in all honesty covering in detail
would call for an hour long video there
are simply so many noteworthy features
for benchmarking network attached
storage products going forward are we
using the Intel NASA performance toolkit
if you haven't seen or heard an SVT
before it's a file system exercise or an
analysis tool designed to enable direct
measurement of home network attached
storage this tool emulates the behavior
of an actual application to provide
real-world workloads of typical digital
applications used by home users for
testing the TS 253 a has been configured
using a pair of Western Digital red pro
4 terabyte hard drives in raid 1
basically I test all 2-bay devices in
raid 1 in anything larger such as the
Synology ds4 1-5 play using raid 5 the
performance of the TS 250 3a is very
strong and we can see that in many of
the tests it's able to max out the
gigabit network connection with
performance just north of 100 megabytes
per second first let's look at the
application performance here we have
slightly mixed results though for the
most part the TS 253 is very impressive
particularly in the content creation
test now when looking at the
file and directory copying results
receive at the most part the TS 253 a
does very well especially given its
being compared to some pretty stiff
competition the download or from NASA
performances Intel labels it was most
impressive without question the TS 253 a
is the ultimate Home Server slash media
player this is a very powerful product
that's capable of the good many things
in fact there really isn't much it can't
do and yet novice Tech users can take
full advantage of all the features there
are few nasty vices that offer hdmi out
let alone dual display support so it's a
very cool feature indeed and it's what
allows this to be a genuine home theater
pc replacement cue naps feature-rich qts
operating system looks great is easy to
use and it's also very responsive the
addition of the hybrid S station is
awesome but I have to admit I've only
started to scratch the surface with
what's possible here the software along
with the TS 253 Ace Hardware I was able
to handle any video file we threw at it
the only real issue here being that were
limited just thirty Hertz at 4k due to
the HDMI 1.4 a support as you might
expect all this greatness comes at a
price and a rather large one at that the
tube a model that we looked at cost five
hundred US dollars or six hundred and
seventy Australian and diskless form
this does in my opinion make the larger
four bay model are much better buy at
six hundred US dollars or seven hundred
and sixty AUD overall the Keen up TS 253
a is honestly the most capable and
complete home user NASA I've ever come
across and I have no trouble
recommending it to anyone that can
afford it if you have any questions let
me know
I'm your host Matt as always and I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
