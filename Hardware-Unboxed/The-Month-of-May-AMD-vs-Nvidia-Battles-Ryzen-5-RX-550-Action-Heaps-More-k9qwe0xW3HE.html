starting something a bit different I
haven't done before I've decided I will
do a monthly recap type video obviously
once a month now we'll be looking back
at what happened in May the monthly
recap is something that quite a few of
you been asking me to do and for reasons
I can't really explain I've just been
avoiding doing it I guess it didn't
really interest me so I thought it might
not interest most of you but recently
there have been a lot of people
requesting I create videos that I've
already created some of them quite
recently so I thought the monthly recap
might make sense having never really
done this kind of video before I wasn't
sure on what kind of format to go with
but I realized a good starting point
would be to round up all the videos
published in May so this is where I
started at was at that point I almost
bailed on the idea so in May we
published 28 videos in total and since
there are just 31 days in that month
that's obviously almost one video per
day so no wonder I look and sound like
this don't worry though I'm not going to
cover all the videos feature on the
channel last month in detail rather I'll
link them in the video description for
this video I'll just go over the ones of
interest or any that I'd like to add a
few notes to that said though this is
probably going to be a bit of a lengthy
video but I think that we well worth
watching for the harbour unboxed fans
starting off the month
Tim checked out the AOC argonne AG 25 1
FZ an affordable 25 inch 240 Hertz
display or at least it was affordable
for a display of those specifications
then later in the month I announced for
the harbour unboxed in collaboration
with tech city and AOC would be giving
away a pair of 240 Hertz monitors and
the winners were announced on a live
stream during competition the winners
have since been contacted and AOC has
arranged to send the monitors out so
congratulations to those guys next up I
checked out their Radeon rx 550 pad with
the Pentium G 45 60 and it proved to be
a very capable combo since then you guys
have been demanding rx 550 versus GT
1030 comparison and that is in the works
guys as we speak so expect that to be
delivered later this month moving on Tim
checked out the cheapest gaming laptop
to feature a GeForce GTX 10-7
d GPU the seuss ROG Strix GL 502 vs 4
$1700 us even though it is the cheapest
Intel seventh generation laptop to
feature the gtx 1070 some of you was
shocked by the asking price I mean come
on guys it's a high-end gaming laptop
anyway Tim put together a high quality
15 minute video that's well worth
watching for potential buyers just three
days into May and I found myself in
Melbourne attending the upgrade
Australia 5.0 event that was a heap of
fun and I was shocked by the quality of
the event there were a heap of amazing
modern systems on display so if you
missed that video it's well worth
checking out just for the eye candy then
we have the big one the epic battle
between the rx 580 and GTX 1060 a
27-game showdown that took 31 grafts
spread across 21 minutes to resolve in
the end I picked the rx 580 though
admitted you clearly go either way
depending on your needs and preference
the most up voted common award goes to
the brother with this nice little
message you put so much work into your
videos and I'd like to thank you for
that well thank you mate that will get
me through this month's benchmark
showdowns seriously though you guys Rock
and I really do appreciate all the
encouragement and support on a less
upbeat note unfortunately I was late to
the party reviewing the Auris GTX 1080i
graphics card apparently gigabyte had
some kind of issue with supply for the
early samples so harbour and box was
placed on a waiting list how could they
do that to me anyway I was thankful to
get a sample in the end it was a mighty
impressive graphics card which begs the
question why did I spill cool on it
deliberately yep just a few days after
reviewing the most expensive graphics
card I've ever got from gigabyte I
decided to test their claims that the
card features a special coating that
protects it against liquid cooling leaks
amongst other things that video was 14
minutes of pain but I'm happy the card
still works or does it if you haven't
watched that one go check it out we had
three unboxing boxes episodes last month
starting with episode 26 Ida heap of fun
with this one despite nearly breaking my
toe by dropping our monitor stand on it
I've recovered though now so thanks for
asking then we got down to some very
serious business
Verizon v 1400 or Rison v 1600 if you're
a gamer which one should you choose
well this was another video I had a lot
of fun with and I was really happy with
the finished product and over 2400 of
you felt the same way while about 36
were less than impressed mr. Homma is
one the most uploaded comment by
shedding a lot on my rise in addiction
so far a cure is yet to be found
experts believe my condition will worsen
soon with the release of throat Ripper
so consider yourselves warned there was
simply no getting away from the risin 5
action last month next up we had a what
does it take to play episode focused on
prey and for this little number we went
with the risin 5 1,400 accompanied by
the geforce gtx 1050 TI the top comment
for that video was from brian of tech
city who left this little zinger nice
shirt
a hundred and sixty-six upvotes why guys
why please don't encourage him moving on
we had more gtx 980ti action this time
checking out the palette GT x 1080 TI
super jet stream i really did like that
graphics card but Santa's Hydra misses
the old days when hardware looked like
real hardware and not like toys well I
like my toys thank you very much
that said though he did raise a good
point and yes more gtx 1060 and rx 580
reviews are incoming
in fact tomorrow I will have a review on
the RS rx 580 xt r and it's a beauty oh
and if you happen to go back and watch
the pallet gtx 1080 to our video please
note the software it's called thunder
master i had a bit of a brain fart and
called it the rust master giggity and
we're back to another unboxing box's
episode this time we've got some new
graphics cards laptops and storage
devices and i showed off my customer
creation which has now been named rise
and watch the finished product will be
on the channel very shortly after i
finished tearing boxes apart i took a
look back at the Radeon r9 290 to see
how it was getting on in modern titles
my friends over at foreigns gaming tech
and nerd tech chasm stopped by to leave
some nice comments so thanks to those
guys love their work also and of course
we were spammed with fine wine
technology comments that's always fun
Tim was busy last month with uni exams
but he did get a few videos and next up
we have his gigabyte arrow 15 review
pure awesomeness as Tim put it the usual
hilarious comments will
left you know the ones that allude to
the fact that Tim's not me we get it
guys the channel has two hosts seriously
though we appreciate you guys keep the
jokes coming next up we have my surprise
video of the month I'll never understand
how the YouTube algorithm works but I
was loving the love on this one somehow
a geforce gtx 1070 review in 2017 an
entire year mind you after it was first
released is my biggest hitter of the
month
never before is a video smash past by
100,000 views so quickly but I'll take
it
I actually put quite a bit of time and
effort into that one so the fact that it
did so well for the channel is really
nice anyway I am of course talking about
my galaxy TX 1070 katana does size
matter video I'm wondering if the does
size matter tag helped the video was
thrown in with a heap of does penis size
matter related content I guess it does
if you want big views moving on in
another measuring contest we compared
the eight core six core and four core
eyes and CPUs in terms of gaming
performance unsurprisingly 6 cores
offered the optimal experience but the
results overall were a little surprising
so check that one out if you haven't
already traveling with me to Computex
was MSI's GS 43 vr 7 re phantom pro a
smart little 14 inch laptop the packs a
serious punch before heading to thailand
i thought it best to see just how well
this thing encodes 4k videos so I put
together a laptop versus desktop
encoding comparison which I thought was
pretty cool and so did most of you the
following week I decided to check out
how the msi gs70 RF stealth pro handle
itself when it came to games and again
the results were impressive sadly I have
had to return that laptop now but I
appreciate all your comments trying to
convince MSI to leave it with me those
comments came about in the unboxing
boxes episode 28 when I suggested you
guys could back me up by trying to
convince MSI to leave the laptop with me
they did provide the channel with
financial support to attend Computex
2017 so perhaps I shouldn't push my luck
speaking of episode 28 that's the moment
where I let you guys know what I really
thought about Samsung's Galaxy s8 plus
and its complete lack of durability it's
worth checking out if you're considering
buying
one of those smart phones after that Tim
returned for another laptop review this
time checking out the razor blade 2017
model basically build quality was
excellent the aluminium unibody did it
for Tim but yeah she's a pricey little
number moving along I popped on the blue
tshirt mats blue tshirt for old times
sake and checked out the r9 390 and gtx
970 my mates i chrushank rumor was
awarded top comment on that one why
can't anyone on the channel list be
called Bob or Bill or perhaps even Steve
in the comment section I'm such a
simpleton anyway thanks to the loves I
appreciate you next on the menu Tim
looked at what is probably the best
small form-factor PC he's reviewed so
far when he checked out course as one I
have to admit the one does look mighty
impressive and you lot seem to agree
based on the comment section as always
Tim put together a very high quality
in-depth review so if you haven't
checked out course as one yet I suggest
you invest some time in Tim's review
wrapping things up before I headed to
compete X was a twenty nine game battle
between the Radeon rx 570 and three
gigabyte GTX 1060 I thought this one
would generate a bit more buzz than it
did
perhaps the excitement of combi sex and
all those yet to be announced new
products had ever undistracted
in the end I guess over 800 comment is a
decent level of engagement for a channel
of our size then it was time for
Computex and on day one Brian and myself
run around checking things out as they
were setting up we also announced the
winners of the AOC giveaway and from
there the computation videos just kept
flowing if you missed the coverage be
sure to check it out and that about
wraps up May a pretty quick recap wasn't
it now it's June and we're doing it all
over again shockingly were already a
dozen videos deep into June and there's
so much more to get done I can't wait to
see what Intel's
10 core core I 970 100x has to offer
before AMD delivers thread Ripper
there's also a heap of really
cool-looking X 299 motherboards that I'm
keen to check out as well
so for those of you who watched our
content last month a big thank you and
hopefully you'll enjoy what's to come
later this month I'm your host Steve yet
