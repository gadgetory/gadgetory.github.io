the first time ever on the channel going
to review a graphics card from a company
called Galax who the galaxy you asked
well originally they were known as
galaxy technology there are Chinese
company that were founded back in 1994
and as you guys are probably guessed
they make graphics cards now the
European viewers will probably recognize
today's product as it does sell under
the KF a2 brand in Europe for the rest
of the world a we have the galaxy our
name and I have to say their products
are becoming increasingly popular here
in Australia on hand today I have the
very smart looking galaxy gtx 1070 x OCH
snooper in white yeah it's actually the
extreme overclocking sniper of course
well the name is quite interesting but
more importantly so - as the graphics
card there isn't much in the package if
I'm honest but that's ok we don't need
any gimmicky high bandwidth SLI bridges
or a cheap mousepad for example
ultimately what we really want is an
affordable gtx 1070 packin as many cool
features as possible this is exactly
what the extreme overclocking sniper
delivers priced at just four hundred and
thirty dollars us or six hundred dollars
Aussie it's not a great deal more than
the most basic gtx 1070 models yet it's
a hell of a lot better first let's take
a look at the design of the graphics
card this being the white version we do
have a really nice white glossy fan
shroud here complete with a pair of 100
millimeter fans now the fans themselves
are semi-transparent which provides a
very eye-catching effect thanks to the
embedded white LED lights the fans
themselves are designed to be as quiet
as possible and like many modern
graphics cards during periods of idle or
light work they don't actually spin at
all in fact the GPU needs to reach 45
degrees before the fans will turn on at
all I should also note that the white
fan shroud is crafted from aluminium and
is reasonably thick salt won't Bend
easily especially when handling the
graphics card is even a crown shape
edged out at the end of the shroud and
that's kind of cool
moving on to the back of the graphics
card we do find more white glossy
goodness thanks to a rather large
backplate this is another creatively
crafted
of aluminium that protects the card
while also ensuring optimal heat
dissipation of course though the most
important feature of all can be found
here RGB lighting enhancing the lighting
effect is a clear plastic strip that
runs the entire length of the graphics
card and is illuminated by numerous LED
lights now by removing just a few screws
the large cooler can be separated from
the PCB giving us a look at the goods
underneath here we find a
custom-designed PCB featuring numerous
high quality components there's an
adequate 5+2 phase power design fire
phasers for the GPU and two phases for
the gddr5 memory we also find an 8 pin
PCIe connector along with a 6 pin
connector galux has also installed a
small aluminium heat sink over the vrm
chips and this is actively cooled via
the 100 millimeter fans above of course
the fans are primarily there to cool
that massive aluminium heatsink which
has been upgraded with 4 nickel plated
copper heat pipes extending out the top
of the heatsink are 2 8 millimeter thick
heat pipes while an additional 2 6
millimeter pipes head in the opposite
direction in total a graphics card
weighs 870 grams which is reasonably
heavy half of that weight of course is
accounted for by the heatsink we have
seen gtx 1070 and GT x 1080 models
weighing over 1 kilo so again there's
nothing too extreme here the heatsink
though does feature a copper base insert
and there are a number of high quality
thermal pads overall the build quality
and design of the galaxy x 10-7 xtreme
sniper is top-notch
but just how good does it look powered
up well for that we need to install it
in a system and load up the extreme
tuner plus software the software works
well you can set any color you like and
you can even input a custom RGB decimal
code the option is set effects such as
breathing cycle breathing and strobing
is possible and you can even set the
speed of course should you not enjoy
bright flashy lights they can be left
static or disabled entirely as you might
expect overclocking is also a big focus
of this software for novice users you
can quickly apply a mild 3% or 5%
overclock meanwhile for advanced users
you can manually set the core and memory
clock speeds along with the power and
temp targets additionally it's also
possible to raise the core and memory
voltages ok so let's talk
overclocking we have tested quite a few
gtx 1070 graphics cards now and we have
found them all to be quite similar in
terms of have a clocking performance in
fact it doesn't really even seem no
matter which model hits the highest base
clock due to the way GPU boost 3.0 works
the cards that run the coolest generally
deliver the best performance keeping
that in mind to the extreme overclocking
sniper today base clock of 1795
megahertz which should see it boost to
at least nineteen hundred and twenty
three megahertz throughout our testing
we saw it maintained a clock speed of at
least two thousand and seventy eight
megahertz which is slightly lower than
some of the cars we've previously tested
by around about three to five percent
the gddr5 memory also clocked to two
thousand six hundred and fifty megahertz
which isn't bad but again not the
highest figure we've been able to
achieve please note I have only tested
three games as this review doesn't
really require more for more extensive
testing on the gtx 1070 please check our
large benchmark reviews that generally
cover twenty or so games the games
included are also a bit dated now as i
can't update data for cards such as the
Asuza Strix for example this is a
graphics card i no longer have an aces
don't seem to understand the value of
leaving hardware with reviewers fun
going testing anyway here we can see
that the galaxy extreme overclocking
sniper roughly matches the asou Strix
model and is a fraction faster than the
gigabyte extreme gaming it was just for
FPS separating the various board partner
models and the margin of error being
like one to two FPS it's fair to say
they all deliver much the same
performance the extreme overclocking
sniper is able to match the Strix card
in Far Cry primal and this is really
true for the gigabyte extreme gaming as
well as it was just a single frame
faster finally have star wars
battlefront and again the extreme
overclocking sniper sits alongside other
custom gtx 1070 graphics cards that
we've tested so far as it produced an
average of 90 FPS at 1440p when it comes
to operating temperatures the galaxy
extreme overclocking sniper managed to
stay below 70 degrees
even when overclocked so that was
impressive to see performance wasn't
quite as good as the MSI gaming X or the
gigabyte extreme gaming or even their su
Strix models but given the price which
sees the gallic small considering more
affordable
an impressive result it's well worth
pointing out that the extreme
overclocking sniper is extremely quiet
even when overclocked I couldn't
actually tell her fans or running or not
without a quick visual inspection so
this makes the temperatures all the more
impressive for the power consumption
figures we see the extreme overclocking
sniper isn't as aggressive with voltages
say the gigabyte extreme gaming and we
see that even once overclocked power
consumption doesn't increase that much
overall pretty typical stuff here so the
galaxy ETX 1070 extreme overclocking
sniper has a really long name but it's
also a very cool-looking graphics card
that stacks up very well against the
competition the key things to note of
course is the price at $600 ozzie this
galaxy gtx 1070 is very competitive for
the most part the MSI gaming X and a su
Strix models for example cost a little
more at six hundred and forty dollars
and the gigabyte extreme gaming is
priced even higher at six hundred and
seventy dollars with the price in mind
the build quality design features an
accompanying software all very
impressive obviously if you have a white
themed build then this graphics card is
going to look right at home and
complement the system very well for
example it would look absolutely
stunning in my thermal take the tower
900 build as my first look at a galaxy
Aphex card I have to say I am very
impressed with the gtx 1070 extreme
overclocking sniper but what do you guys
