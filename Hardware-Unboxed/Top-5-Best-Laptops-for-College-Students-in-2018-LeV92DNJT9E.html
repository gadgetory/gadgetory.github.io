things I get asked a lot is to recommend
a laptop for someone who is a student
whether that's a school college
university or whatever I was a student
myself not that long ago and trying to
find a good laptop for not much money
that was suitable for student life was
always a bit of a struggle particularly
as there are so many options on the
market on top of that I found that a lot
of websites would make lists talking
about the best laptops for college
students only to include a bunch of
really expensive options that don't
deliver great bang for your buck but in
this video my rendition of the best
laptops for students I'll be focusing on
great value pics that hit some of the
key features students tend to look for
not every laptop in this collection is
dirt cheap but I have covered a range of
price points from below $500 to
something the rich kids can buy as well
so let's get straight into it
probably the most important feature for
students is portability you really don't
want to be lugging around a massive
laptop to and from class on top of
having to carry textbooks and all sorts
of other stuff so sides and way too
often super important I've tested a lot
of ultra portable laptops over these and
the clear standard in the portability
category is the LG gram 13 as the name
suggests this variant of the LG gram is
13 inches in size so it's already down
in the more compact end of the laptop
size spectrum it also has pretty slim
bezels so not a lot of space is wasted
but crucially this 13 inch system weighs
just 965 grams well under the 1.3 to 1.5
kilograms of most other ultra portables
of this size the LG gram 13 also ticks
off one of the other key aspects for
students and that's battery life if
you're at class all day you need good
battery life we'll have to carry around
a charger well the good news if the gram
13 has a huge 72 what our battery
despite its low weight and that leads to
some of the best battery life I've
tested especially considering it has a
touchscreen you'll get a day's worth of
usage from a single charge with that
much worry and then you also end up with
pretty decent specs the base model packs
a Core i5
8250 u quad core eight gigabytes of RAM
and 256 gig of storage plus you get full
size USB ports and a 1080p display the
more expensive models aren't worth
buying in my opinion just stick to the
base model and upgrade the RAM more
storage itself if need be because this
laptop sticks a lot of the category
students need it's not the cheapest in
this list going for it a thousand US
dollars but if you have that amount to
spend this is the best option out there
and honestly many laptops that are
priced up to $1500 or so won't provide
what the Graham does so I think it's
really worth it for the price
the other thing that students might find
useful is a laptop that supports an
active stylus for easy note-taking
annotating our equation solving a lot of
student focus laptops are now supporting
this feature everything from the surface
pro down to pretty cheap devices but the
HP Envy x-360 13 I'm recommending here
is great for a number of reasons it's
competitively priced it has decent
hardware inside it's portable and it
comes with a pen included in the price
HP is just about to release the 2018
model of this laptop but having used the
previous model and the larger 15
interruption from this year is looking
like the more portable 13-inch parent
will be a winner for just seven hundred
and sixty dollars you can get this
laptop with a 1080p display a quite
powerful Rison five 2500 you processor
256 gig of storage and eight gig of ram
in fact even if you don't need the pen
support for note-taking the envy x-360
13 is one of the best options you can
get for around the seven hundred and
fifty dollar mark there's a couple of
reasons I prefer this sort of device to
the stylus equipped tablets out there
like the surface pro for one the envy
x-360 13 has a 360 degree hinge so you
can easily flip around the display into
a tablet mode for note-taking
but because the envy has a full keyboard
built-in and works well as a laptop you
get an uncompromised typing experience
the keyboard covers that come with the
surface pro and other tablets aren't
that great and typing on a laptop those
devices there is no such problem with
the convertible laptop it's built as a
laptop first but because of the hinge
you can still easily use the styles for
annotating and drawing the envy x-360 is
also a good option because of the AMD
risin 5 processor it uses which has
integrated graphics capable of playing
popular games like 49 and that's not
something you'll get with equivalent
Intel CPUs for the price I think a lot
of students will be really happy with
what the envy x-360 13 provides though
you shouldn't expect portability or
battery life as good as the LG gran if
you are really set on a tablet form
factor though and a drooling over
something like a surface pro I'd
actually recommend the Eevee
instead the entry-level Eevee is similar
to the entry-level surface pro from a
hardware standpoint but the Eevee is
cheaper and it includes both the
keyboard cover and styles in the price I
love a good bargain and I reckon the
Eevee is one such device
flying under the radar
the two laptops I've recommended so far
are my top two picks for students but
understandably not everyone has $1,000
or 750 dollars to spend on a laptop for
school for those on a tighter budget
I'll point you towards two
configurations of the Acer Aspire a 15 a
laptop I've actually recommended before
the deliver is basically the best
hardware you can get for an entry-level
to mid-range price the aspire a 15 isn't
a pretty laptop it's thick most amount
of plastic has large bezels and isn't
super portable it also won't deliver you
particularly amazing battery life but it
lacks in those areas it makes up for in
its hardware for just $600 this laptop
will deliver you a quad core Core i5
8252 processor eight gigabytes of ram
nvidia geforce MX 150 discrete graphics
a 256 gig SSD and a 15.6 inch 1080p
display that's just as powerful as the
other two laptops we've mentioned so far
but at a significantly reduced price
it's actually quite impressive that a
laptop of this size has managed to
include an SSD and discrete graphics
both of which have a significant impact
on performance the MX 150 might not be
amazingly fast but it's able to play
fortnight and overwatch and that's not
bad for a $600 laptop if your budget is
even tighter there's a 380 dollar model
of the aspire a 15 that cuts things even
further you get just a dual core Core i3
8130 you processor 6 gig of ram and no
discrete GPU or SSD but you do get a one
terabyte hard drive and a 1080p display
crucially despite being so cheap this
variant does not leave you with a
painfully slow Pentium Celeron or Atom
processor which are often found in $400
laptops it's also possible to add in an
SSD later to get a handy speed bump if
you want
between lectures assignments studying
and of course parties you might want to
fit in a bit of gaming but you only have
a relatively tight budget enough to buy
just one system and you want it to be
capable of handling your schoolwork plus
today's high end games
well there's one standard option that
provides affordable gaming hardware in a
decent laptop form factor and that's the
ace of predator Helios
300 like the budget laptops I was just
talking about the 15 inch Helios 300
isn't super portable and won't give you
outstanding battery life at least
compared to assumingly price 13-inch
ultra book but ultra ebooks are
basically useless for triple-a gaming
while the Helios 300 packs respectable
mid-range hardware that's easily capable
of playing today's games at 1080p with
decent quality settings I'd recommend
one of two options here for a touch over
$1000 you can get the last gen model
which packs a quad core Core i7 7700 HQ
nvidia geforce gtx 1066 gigabyte
graphics 16 gig of ram and a 256 gig SSD
along with the 1080p 60 Hertz display
you'll get a great gaming experience and
while it is $1,000 us it delivers
basically the best value for money in
this product category if you have the
budget to spend 150 dollars more you can
grab the latest Helios 300 which pumps
you up to a six core Core i7
8750 H and wins a high refresh 1080p 144
Hertz display this new model is about
10% faster in games thanks to that new
CPU and cost roughly 15% more giant
reckon is about fair considering that
high refresh display it also brings you
might not be the coolest guy ever for
lugging around a large gaming laptop to
lectures but it is still portable and
can be run on the battery for a few
hours and if you carry it around
everyday you might be able to ditch that
gym membership and save some cash
if you're a rich kid and money isn't as
much of an obstacle for you look no
further than the Microsoft Surface book
- this thing is very expensive but it
packs a lot of handy features into the
one portable package want to take notes
well the surface book - supports one of
the best active pens on the market and
the screen detaches from the base so you
can use it as either a legitimate tablet
or as a fully fledged laptop want
something portable the 13.5 inch model
is reasonably thin and light
particularly for the hardware you get
and if you need good battery life well
the surface book is one of the best
performers in that department and even
if you want a game well the core i7
models PACCAR discrete gtx 1050 GPU
which isn't the fastest GPU out there
but it's basically the fastest you can
get in a 13-inch device and can actually
play modern games but to get all these
features it will cost you a pretty penny
the gtx 1050 is only available in mul
starting at 2000 US dollars and I'd
actually recommend the 2500 hole model
so you can get a decent amount of
storage and RAM yep that is a lot of
money but it's an impressive little
machine that's it for this look at the
best laptops for students right now if
you have any other good recommendations
