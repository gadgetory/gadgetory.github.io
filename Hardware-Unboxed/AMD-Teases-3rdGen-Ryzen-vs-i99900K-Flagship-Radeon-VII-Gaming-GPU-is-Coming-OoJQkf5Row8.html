just finished watching ambe's keynote
and joining in with some of you guys no
discord chat for some discussion on the
event pretty interesting stuff but at
the same time amy didn't really pull any
major surprises the two big things they
discussed were some minor details on
third-generation Rison for desktop plus
a full announcement of AMD Radeon 7
which is their upcoming consumer Vegas 7
animated GPU and there's no word on Navi
at all so let's first kick things off
with what AMD showed on third generation
rise in CPUs for desktop as expected we
didn't get the full product stack unveil
or anything like that just a few teasers
and a couple of demos the big news is
Lisa sue showed off the actual virgin
Rison package at the show and an antic
also managed to get some close-ups of
the CPU at a private meeting basically
what we're seeing is a multi die
approach with an iodine ler to what the
company first showed off last year with
their epic CPUs on the left is the i/o
die in question and on the right is the
seven nanometer CPU core triplet with
eight cores inside not super surprising
to see the sort of design consumed
that's what they first announced with
epic but we do actually have official
confirmation that that's what it's
looking like for third gen rising we
don't have any other details to go on so
no clock speeds and no confirmation
about what rising third gens final core
count will be for the high-end part you
can see there is clearly space on the
package for a second CPU core triplet or
perhaps a GPU die for MMD's desktop AP
use but aim D isn't ready to talk about
anything beyond what they showed off
today theoretically a 16 core CPU would
be possible with the second triplet
shoved in there but we just don't know
if anybody will release higher core cap
models this generation or in a future
generation one example I like to think
of is first gen thread Ripper which
topped out at 16 cores with to eight
core dies and two dummy dies and that
was only increased of 32 cores and 0
dummy dies with second gen thread Ripper
now I'm not saying one way or another
when aimed he might choose to put 16
cores on a m4 but I wouldn't just go to
because there's a gap on the interposed
for another chip word that AMD will fill
that spot this generation will if you
learn at some point I think almost
certainly when will they feel it though
there's no official word at this stage
when in countries from and non tech
asked MD about more than eight cause the
answer was there is some extra room on
the package you might expect us to put
more on that package again no
confirmation on when that will occur
whether this is you know with the first
generation of this sort of design or
with a future product line they also
weren't willing to discuss whether the
eight Cornwall shown off at the show is
a flagship CPU or something more
mainstream however they did confirm it
would support PCIe 4.0 just like their
epic CPS however they did pit third gen
rising up against Intel's flagship core
I nine and 9900 Kate in Cinebench with
both processes scoring roughly the same
amount around twenty fifty points in the
multi-threaded workload but the key
piece of information here is the total
system power consumption for the ninety
nine hundred K was around a hundred and
eighty watts compared to 130 watts for
the third gen rising unit with identical
components inside otherwise this means
the Zen two-sample was operating at
around 75 watts compared to 125 watts
for the 99 K also we can do some basic
extrapolation on the score only achieved
here the risin 720 700 X it's around
1770 points in Cinebench so it's rise in
3000 hitting 2050 or so that's a 16%
increase with an early engineering
sample AMD was keen to stress clock
speeds aren't final and it's hard to say
exactly how this m2 CPU is clocked
because we're not sure how much of a
factor i pc improvements have had in
delivering this final score if the gains
are purely from clock speeds the demo
system would be running around 4.5 to
4.6 q hertz all core at 75 watts which
is very impressive and shows off what
AMD will be able to achieve with seven
nanometers it's worth mentioning that
AMD's past demos have used CPUs clock
reasonably close to their final clock so
I wouldn't be expecting performance to
change significantly from what AMD
showed off today but this demo is quite
early compared to the product release
which only said
expected to happen mid 2019 no specific
month or anything was given so that's
all on rise in third-generation we got a
look at the package we've got a
performance demo with some power
consumption figures and we know that one
model will be eight core so there were
no product names no clock speeds no
pricing no firm launch dates and nothing
else was discussed we'll have to wait
for final details and that will happen
much closer to the launch
however AMD did make one product
announcement as we mentioned in our last
video discussing ambe's plans for CES
and that product is a consumer 70
nanometer Vega GPU known as the Radeon
seven its stylized as VII but it's
apparently pronounced seven Roman
numerals and all that sort of thing if
the world's first seven animated gaming
GPU and it's based on their die shrink
of Vega to seven nanometers also known
as Vega xx luckily for us AMD wasn't shy
with information about the Radeon seven
and that makes sense because the card
will be available on February 7th it has
60 compute units for a total of 3840
stream processors a little less than
what we saw with vega 64 64 compute
units however clock speeds are much
higher ambi said the card can hit 1800
megahertz compared to 1546 megahertz for
vega 64 we're also getting faster two
gigabit per second HP m2 and a whopping
16 gigabytes of it on a 4096 bit bus
vega 20 also has a better back-end
improved over first gen vega
which should improve performance in some
situations most notably the rob count
has doubled from 64 to 128 and that
should solve a lot of bottlenecks with
the design while the Radeon 7 has fewer
compute units and it's only clocked 16
percent higher than Vega 64 some of
those small architecture improvements
mean higher than expected performance
gains in games AMD is stating the
iranian 7 should be between 20 and 42
percent faster than vega 64 with an
overall average of 29%
as this is a flagship card md have gone
all out with performance so power
consumption is said to be the same as
vega 64 at around 300 watts
md is utilizing seven animators to
achieve higher performance here rather
than lower power consumption with this
particular product
in terms of a comparison with nvidia AMD
showed the Radeon seven matching or
beating the GeForce r-tx 2080 in games
like Battlefield 5 far cry 5 and strange
Brigade with unspecified configurations
if that is what performance will
actually be like in the end across a
wide variety of games that's pretty
decent from AMD's new flagship without
going all-out and matching the r-tx 2080
Ti and we also showed a demo of Devil
May Cry 5 running on the Radeon 7 at 4k
and it was hitting upwards of 80 fps
although there was no comparison to any
other hardware for pricing the Radeon 7
also matches the r-tx 2080 an MSRP of
699 US dollars this seems fine but it's
a little disappointing that AMD like
Nvidia I guess isn't really adding
anything new in terms of a price to
performance ratio in the high end GPU
market with Nvidia dominating this space
for so long they've been able to push
out their icx 2080 with a very similar
value proposition to their previous GTX
1080i and well ambi is basically just
coming and matched that here now we have
I guess competition in the ITX 20 class
but there's been really no progress on
value as this is a GPU using Vega AMD
will also run into a few of the issues
that have plagued them for a while now
power consumption for the Radeon seven
will likely be much higher than the ITX
2080 and you won't get any accelerated
rate racing functionality now rate
racing isn't all that useful just yet
but still it's a feature that NVIDIA has
with their card that AMD doesn't we're
also in the position where AMD is only
currently able to match the r-tx 2080 on
7 nanometers at a higher level of power
consumption invidious GPS are still
using 12 nanometers and are still more
efficient and at the very top end still
more powerful as well Amie definitely
has a long way to go with their next
generation GPU architectures to improve
that picture especially as in video 7
animator or perhaps eight nanometer
cards are on the horizon but at least
for now with what is largely a year and
a half old architecture MD can hit r-tx
2080 level performance for the first
time the Radeon 7 GPU itself ditches the
blower style cool for a triple fan
design with a beefy heat sink beneath
and there appears to be a nice metal
shroud around it or with red Radeon
branding
we should be getting our own ready on
seven card relatively soon for testing
so stay tuned for the usual benchmarks
and comparisons around the cards release
on February 7th also anyone who buys a
Radeon 7gp you will get Tom Clancy's the
division 2 bundled in for free
alternatively you can buy either a
select risin 5 or aizen 7 cpu to also
get the division 2 in a bundle aside
from the third generation risin teaser
and the announcement of Radeon 7 a.m. d
didn't really discuss anything else
worth mentioning although they did spend
some time I guess rehashing previous
announcements such as their second gen
mobile AP you line up the rise and stuff
is the most interesting to both Steve
Knight although there's still a lot to
play out there simply put you know
there's so much we don't know about
these processes at this point why not
super surprising considering AMD did
launch the Radeon 7 that wasn't a single
mention of ambe's next-generation Navi
GPUs in the keynote no road map updates
or teasers which does suggest it is
still quite some time away I guess that
makes sense
Amy wouldn't want to launch the Radeon 7
then supersede it or their recently
released rx 590 so quickly Navi is still
scheduled for 2019 but at this point
it's looking more like a second half of
the Year product so I woke up at 4 a.m.
local time here in Australia to cover
this launch so I'm pretty tired at this
point gonna go edit this one uploaded
then get some rest I reckon they'll
probably be a few more tidbits to come
out of CES throughout the rest of the
week but this was the last major keynote
after we had Nvidia and Intel already
delivered their press conferences a few
days ago so that's it for this one as
always you can subscribe for more news
updates throughout CES and also to catch
our radio on 7 review at some point in
the future as always you can consider
supporting us on patreon to get access
to our monthly live streams and
exclusive disgorge hat I'll catch you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
