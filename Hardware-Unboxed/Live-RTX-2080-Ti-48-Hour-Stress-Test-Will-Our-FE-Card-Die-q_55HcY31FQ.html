stream you're watching now is a little
different to our usual content on
hardware box we don't usually do live
streams on the main channel we normally
keep all that stuff for our patreon but
today we're doing something that will
probably interest you guys for a few
minutes and then become extremely boring
we certainly don't expect you to watch
this entire live stream so what's
happening here well the goal is
basically distress test our NVIDIA
GeForce r-tx 20 ATT I found as
additional graphics card and that's for
a number of reasons we've all heard
about the higher the normal failure rate
for our TX 28 he T is specifically those
that use the founders edition design
either the FE cards themselves or board
partner models that use the same PCB so
far our card hasn't shown any issues but
we also haven't been using it for
extended periods of time what piqued our
interest was an article from Kyle
Bennett over at Hard OCP a little over a
week ago now he purchased
2fe 20 ATT eyes from nvidia and one died
with the space invaders issue while
gaming when his replacement card arrived
he put it through a stress test running
unit in heaven for about eight hours
which the card passed but then failed to
boot after the system shut down with the
card basically being pronounced dead
from there on his first dead card used
micron G DDR 6 memory and the
replacement used Samsung G DDR 6 memory
and both died so basically we were
curious whether our card would die under
a similar lengthy stress test we have
used the card for some game testing for
longest periods of time but not 8 hours
or more we haven't seen any Space
Invaders issues or really any other
problems with the FE card but there's a
possibility that a long stress test will
kill the card similar to what happened
with hard o cepes unit and this is where
this livestream comes in basically we're
going to be running the heaven benchmark
in the loop on the ITX 2080 TI for the
next 48 hours or more while recording
the whole thing and rather than simply
recording it to local storage we figured
it would be maybe somewhat interesting
at least easier to stream the whole
thing so you guys can occasionally check
back to see how it's progressing and
we'll also have a handy video ready to
go in case there's any problems it will
be
right here in the video to replay
neither Steve no I believe the card will
die will be very surprised if the card
dies we certainly aren't expecting it to
die but we want to be absolutely 100%
sure the card is a good one and this is
a perfect way to validate in fact I'll
be shocked if the card dies considering
it's been fine up to this point we do
know that the card we have uses micron
memory and like all founders Edition ITX
cards runs pretty hot the backplate in
particular gets scorching hot under load
so so hot that you know to swap the card
during GPU benchmarks prefer to use oven
mitts at times if the card really is
running say the memory and heat levels
outside specifications then a 48 hour
stress test could cause lasting damage
that a couple of hours in a game would
not if the card is going to fail it
would be something like this causing the
problem at least that's our best guess
again we really don't expect it to die
to be clear we aren't running the r-tx
2080 ti overclock this is the card
running at stop clocks in a stressful
situation but something the card
definitely should be able to handle
after all these cards are built and
should be built to handle 100%
utilization for long periods of time and
should have built-in failsafe to prevent
the card from running at dangerous
temperatures voltages or whatever
because this is a test at stock clocks
we expected to survive without any
dramas in fact if it does die I'll be
pretty annoyed because I have to go an
hour made the card and we don't have a
lot of 2082 eyes around here for testing
right now so we really want it to
survive so the card is currently in my
core i7 8700 k test rig normally we
overclock the CPU but I've taken it back
to stock settings for this test it's
also got 16 gigabytes of ddr4 3000
memory inside and a Corsair RM 750 X
power supply the motherboard is a
gigabyte 370 horas gaming ultra Wi-Fi
and we have it all inside the be quiet
dark bass 700 we're keeping everything
under normal operating conditions so the
case is closed we have a single 120
millimeter exhaust fan while the intakes
are 2 140 millimeter fans on the be
quiet silent loop 280
that's our CPU cooler installed in the
front you'll see all this in a second
when we switch to the view of our system
right we also have some thermocouples
attached to the system we have one
directly on
GPU backplate which is one of the
hottest areas of the card we also have a
GPU exhaust reading a case ambient
reading and a general room an ambient
reading so as we go we'll monitor these
temperatures from time to time so this
has been a pre-recorded message simply
to make starting this livestream a bit
easier in a moment I'll be switching
over to the live view of the system
running the stress test we'll start it
up live on stream and I'll stick around
for a little bit to answer some
questions if any of you guys have some
before leaving it running for the next
48 hours I might pop back in from time
to time but basically you'll be left
with a view of the PC running for the
rest of the stream
we don't expect anyone to actually watch
the stream for its entirety please don't
do that but you might find it
interesting to check back every once in
a while to see how it's going anyway
I guess let's get to it hey guys so
thanks for sitting through the recorded
message that we had at the start of the
video here you can see that yeah we're
actually live at the moment this is the
test running here I started this sort of
at the start of the stream
roughly ish so it's been running for
maybe about five minutes and the GPU
year it's already about 85 degrees
Celsius and on the back of the card the
thermocouple that's attached directly to
the back of the GPU itself sitting in
about 72 degrees and it's quite warm
today it's been 30 degrees Celsius so
it's probably I have to say about 25 in
this room at the moment so yeah we're
just gonna sit and watch this for the
next 48 hours I'm not going to stay here
for the whole 48 hours that'd be just
crazy but I'll stick around for a little
bit weren't there some questions and
yeah so if you have any questions put
them in the chat and we'll see how they
are going at the moment and yes 86
degrees is quite warm at the moment it's
quite warm in this room though and we're
not running the fan setting sort of
ridiculous speeds or anything just
standard sort of quiet usurp here with
the silent loop 280 in there and the
rear fan on the back as well so yeah
yeah not super stressful on the GPU but
he's running warm and yeah fun time so
yeah pretty much that's what's going on
at the
so let's check take a look what you guys
sang in the chat here got my screen over
on the side here for this thing as we
mentioned at the start we don't expect
the card to die at all so if you were
wondering you know why are we doing this
we just want to make sure that it's
recorded on some sort of footage that we
can see it and all that sort of thing so
we don't expect it to die but if it does
die we will get that footage on the
screen and then we'll probably follow
this up soon enough so is this why you
guys never sleep yeah pretty much we do
crazy stuff like this which is why we we
never sleep at the moment Steve was out
fishing today at the moment he's in the
chat as well he might answer some
questions for you if you have them there
for him what did your eyes pick up link
ever do to deserve a 48 hour stress test
yeah that's I think that's fair enough
we actually tested we did sort of a test
stream on our extras channel that we
don't really have anything on but we did
that for about 15 hours yesterday nor a
single drop frame so if my ISP is
working well hopefully no dropped frames
for this 48 hour version today is value
really the best stress test look
probably not if we were doing it we
would probably use the more intensive
stress test but we wanted to do that
specifically because that's what
hardware CP said that they used for
their stress test so if you go and check
their article I think we have a link in
the description of this live stream to
their thing where they say that they
benchmarked or at least tested in heaven
on a loop like we're doing here for
eight hours and their car died the one
that uses Samsung memory so we just want
to make sure that we're using the exact
same roughly the same conditions as they
were doing with their cards and we think
if our card passes that should be good
for literally anything we can throw at
it so this is pretty much the most
stressful sort of yeah successful stock
clock setting that you'll ever do pretty
much did Steve catch any fish well
according to him he did catch a few fish
be sent them all back you have to pop in
the pop in the chat Steve and tell
everyone how you're doing for the for
your fishing that was today it was
really good weather today here in
Australia 30 degrees sunny it was lovely
so perfect perfect weather for fishing
use 2080 TI ASO
good enough for 144 Hertz 4k ultra very
high quality gaming you probably don't
need SLI for that set up the 28 DTI in a
lot of games today can do 4k ultra 60fps
so yeah I guess if you turn down the
quality things to very high potential
you get a fair few more frames something
like battlefield 5 for example you can
run out say 80 FPS on Ultra settings
with the 28 eti so SLI yeah I guess if
you add it you might be up to that one
for you for Hertz range but again there
are a lot of issues too with SLI for a
lot of games at the moment plan on
cooking a soft-boiled egg on it at those
temperatures yeah we probably could I
reckon it might take a little longer
than we'd normally be used to in the
boiling water but it's getting right up
there what do the thermocouple say at
the moment actually the back the backs
at 32 degrees 73 degrees Celsius sorry
at the moment 73 on the backplate so
yeah what what would happen if it dies
someone asked that in the chat as well
what we really hope it doesn't because
currently I think all up at hardware box
we have 320 ATT is we've got the
founders Edition card we've got the
GeForce windforce 1 and I believe Steve
as well it's got an horas one that you
some I've seen a review of on the
channel a couple of days ago so those
are the only 20 a UTIs we have currently
the gigabyte ones in my test system that
one we use for testing so if one dies
it's actually bad because we'll need to
get our made and then yeah we'll be
stuck with only two cards which I guess
isn't the end of the world but certainly
we don't want it to be dying on us so is
the live stream for 48 hours
yes the the live stream though we mean
the live stream so chatting with you
guys for I don't know until I get tired
I want to go to because it's 10 p.m.
here on a Saturday in Australia but then
we'll switch to just a view of the
screen here running for the remaining
however many hours up until 48 hours
from where the stream starts we might
even leave it running for longer than
that we really don't know and then yeah
we'll stop it see if there's any issues
we'll do some restarting of the system
because hard OCPs card would seem to be
fine throughout obviously was saying it
was fine for that the whole test then it
didn't boot after that so we're just
wondering whether
we see similar things or not and yet so
how much is this card been used before
doing this test so not a lot we tend to
use you know for benchmarking and things
you might use it for two hours of time
three hours some of the stuff that I've
done on the card was the quality
comparisons you might have seen on the
channel that would have been going for
maybe like four or five hours at most
so yeah
can we have a timer I didn't really
think of that so probably hard to put in
somewhere unless we can figure out that
how to get that going
could you use live streaming what we'd
love to live stream or there's a few
logistical issues do I have to do some
live streams with both Steve and I on
the channel we'd live in separate
locations though and Steve's internet
attic his place in the countryside isn't
great so yeah there's a few issues there
but yeah we'd love to do a few more live
streams we want to do sort of tests like
this to see how you guys think about
live streams so you can come and chat
with us and see what's going on there
and yeah so yeah if you like our live
streams and yeah we might consider doing
more in the future can you bet on how
long until it dies well again we don't
expect it to die but feel free to bet on
it if you want are you monitoring power
consumption not at the moment
unfortunately what seems to be the main
cause of the cards failing
well that is still up in the air a lot
of people have been doing various
different tests whether that's you know
they are not frequent tests but testing
the thermals of the memory I've seen
some you know thermal imagery of that
gamers Nexus has done a lot of good
investigations on the sort of issues
with the r-tx 2082 i dying didn't seem
to find any specific issue that was
caused and you did a lot of things with
like bio splashing down clocking trying
to chill the cards all that sort of
thing didn't seem to find any issues
with the cards that did have the space
invaders issue we think that if the card
dies from this particular test that it
won't get the space invaders issue
because we haven't seen any inkling of
the space invaders issue to this point
if it dies we think it'll just stop
working and then we won't be able to use
it anymore
like in the hydrocity article but yeah I
guess we would sort of figure if that
happens it might be temperature related
but again
this isn't really to sort of figure out
what's going on with the 2080 eyes we've
only got one card that we're testing at
the moment it's just interesting to see
how our sample is going at the moment as
Steve mentioned a few of you guys we're
matching the 200g overclocking that is a
very interesting thing we're going to
have our video tomorrow on that so
roughly 24 hours from now Steve's done a
full investigation of 200g overclocking
with that particular budget CPU it's
very interesting to see how that goes
with the boards that can do it do you
think the cards dying might be a vocal
minority like the issue is blown up
someone yeah I mean it's hard to say
because we sort of have all these
reports from people buying the cards and
I think you're more likely to report on
places like Reddit or other places if
you've bought a $1200 GPU and then it's
died you're probably going to be an
enthusiast you more likely to be in the
enthusiast community so again it's hard
to sort of say what exactly is going to
be the cause with sort of a general
population of 20 ATT is out there I
think it's unusual that we've seen this
many reports of failing cards because
for something like the 1080 try that's
also an enthusiast audience should also
expect them a lot of issues with that
card people will be posting about it and
we didn't see as many issues with the
1080 Ti so potentially there's some
issues with the 2080 toi but again I
guess NVIDIA is probably not going to
tell us what's going on
I hope they resolve the issue it sounds
like they've been resolving the issue so
yeah we just fingers crossed people
buying 28 et eyes at the moment I can
run to these issues in the future
86° the car seems to be running hot
other fans maxed out on the card
nope everything is running stock so the
fans on this particular case are just on
the basic sort of silent profile and
then the GPUs left to do whatever it
wants to do on the fans haven't touched
anything it's all stock yeah so out of
you and Steve who does the most GPU
overclock can definitely stay for his
benchmark videos I've o'clock the GPU in
my main rig but that's pretty much it I
did some overclock you know testing
videos earlier for the 2080 and 2080 I
but honestly I'm not big into sort of
that testing that's more in Steve's
domain so he definitely does more than
that did I make a mistake with buying a
1070 TI for a good price on Black Friday
absolutely not the card is very good
value at the moment one of the cards
we've been saying is probably the best
value for 1440p gaming at the moment
that and sort of Vega 56 as well so
definitely not a big mistake buying the
card on Black Friday I don't what price
you got but there have been available
for very cheap and yeah certainly now
game averages where you know we get 25
games average the amount do the cost per
frame 1070 t is right up there for 1440p
how is your experience with your new
thread Ripper Inc good question
love my thread Ripper rig it's a really
good if you didn't see my video I did
upgraded from risin 7 1700 next to
threaten 429 50 X video editing it's
much faster it renders at least twice as
fast just some of the things with like
live previews and that are very good we
have heard some reports and things like
people saying Intel CPUs much snappier
for sort of editing the editing process
it is not the rendering process but
everything in Premiere but honestly the
2950 X is a lot snap here for sort of
the scrubbing through the timeline sort
of jumping forward you know sort of all
that sort of stuff that we'd normally do
in Premiere adding effects it is much
faster you know playing the footage a
hit play
it plays instantly it was the 1700 X
might have had a small delay there so
certainly being very impressed with that
for gaming it's faster as well so love
that about the 2950 X probably will need
to add in some more storage and more
memory into my system just to handle a
few of those things when I'm being
memory limited at the moment in terms of
memory capacity because Premiere loves
to guzzle the RAM but yeah look loving
it it's great um what else have we got
here
why not overclock it and put it under
more stress it's not really the point of
the video to overclock we know that if
you overclock it crazily
that there's more of a chance it will
die we want to see whether the card will
die under stock conditions because that
is what people would be reporting having
issues with not overclocking their car
but just running the card stock and
potentially having it die after either a
long period of stress for usage or the
space invaders issue straight out of the
box or soon after using it for a little
bit so yeah we want to test it
specifically stock just to make sure
that you know once we run a test like
this or 48 hours into passes and there's
no issues that still works after this we
know that we can throw
anything at this card we're not gonna
have any issues with it but probably not
gonna have to RMA all that sort of
things so yeah what framerate
are you guys getting it's in this screen
it should be in the top corner there
it's probably pretty hard to see if it
was like hundreds of FPS but right
heaven runs really fast from the 2082 at
1080p it's crazy it's a really fast card
what time is it there it's currently
10:20 p.m. so 10:20 p.m. on a Saturday
and we're here making livestream videos
for you guys so yeah fun and stuff when
will your next face megamix great
question I really hope I never have to
face a megamix again we've still got
some of the remnants of megamix we've
got the asparagus juice up there I think
that's all that we've got there from
Taiwan bar table we'll be back with
megamix to Taiwan Computex 2019 that
will be in June next year so if you like
that make em extreme which was terrible
for me later in the day I was really
sick and we had to fly you know the next
day but we'll do it again why not we
know about maybe mix 2.0 we will be
doing it okay what do we got here why
not fir mark very much just a power
virus not really interested in running
that so yeah are we guys New South Wales
no way in Victoria so we haven't been
hit with the there's been a lot of heavy
rain and stuff in New South Wales at the
moment big storms big storms in
Queensland but it's just been lovely
weather down here Victoria love it so
will I be live for two 48 hours straight
no I'm gonna go to bed at some point
need my sleep got to get in there and
get some rest to do not much tomorrow
but we will leave the stream running
with the main view of this monitor the
PC that stuff will be showing you that
for 48 hours so hopefully my internet
doesn't cut out and we can run the whole
48 hours fully without any issues
fingers crossed we have done some
testing to see what my internet is like
nor this set before so we pretty
confident will work for 48 hours but we
never know how long has have been on so
far probably about 25 minutes so not
super long first
test we would definitely you know if we
were testing this GPU for an overclock
we would certainly much longer that's
been running for yet yeah so three other
people saying here are you able to leave
a stream running while still uploading
new videos does YouTube allow for that
we actually don't know it's a good
question is arcade is one of our
wonderful patreon members not sure I
think you can we have we're planning to
release a video tomorrow so if we can't
we'll be pretty annoyed about that but
I'm pretty sure we can have a live
stream and then release a video at the
same time hopefully so
yeah fun stuff
what's this card have for the DRAM is
that micro Samsung is micron in our
particular card so yeah yeah pretty much
it that's it for that one why are you
starting stream at 10 p.m. because we
always routes our videos at 10 p.m. or
at least mark 99% of our videos are
released at 10 p.m. local time for us so
that's great because we can finish our
videos during the day upload them and
they're all ready to go for the evening
which is sort of more you know during
the day for Europe in the US which is
more our main audience for our channel
we love our Aziz as well but there are
only about 5% of our audience compared
to 20% for the u.s. 20% for Europe so
yeah we like to really set a better time
for the guys that are sort of mostly
using mostly watching our videos in that
time slot monitor turns off after an
hour I hope not
we tested it for 15 hours didn't turn
off so yes should be fine
via tech minor so this one is the what
the box over there the NB 24 C I
recommend the GN 24 C this is this this
is the 75 Hertz version the 144 Hertz
version of this particular which is a 24
inch 1080p VA I recommend quite well
this one's not quite as good it's
cheaper but I just generally think you
should spend more money get to 144 Hertz
version because better that's pretty
much it with that one what if the card
catches fire while you're asleep are we
I did actually think of that because
there was that rapport that one car that
caught fire probably pretty
probably something went drastically
wrong there but I don't think it'll be
catching fire so yeah I don't think so
but if it does we've got a smoke alarm
so that should be fine
what are the other 50% of the audience
from 20% us 20% are you five percent au
Asia uh yeah we have quite a strong
audience in India that makes up a
significant portion Canada as well makes
up another significant portion of the
audience so you'll be looking at with
those two add it in and a few like New
Zealand added in as well a few other of
those sort of countries and I'm not sure
i catered all of I think all of you
probably all up so if you add those
together you get to like 7080 percent
then you can throw in like the Asian and
African areas and we're surprising a
number of people from those regions you
might think you know for whatever reason
that they're not into english-speaking
channels but yeah we still get a
significant portion so it's a very world
wide channel that we've got to hear
people tuning in from pretty much
everywhere I was sleeping in the office
for the next 48 hours or do film from
home I felt from home so this is my
studio in my garage here so I can just
go to bed I've got my bedroom here got
my office everything's at home Steve's
the same way it's awesome without doing
it like that what else have you got here
AOC g2 460 PF yeah that's another good
morning if you've picked that up on
Black Friday or something like that
that's probably the monitor I'd
recommend for the TN in that bracket
1080p 144 it's 24 inch so the VI panels
like the vo-tech a little bit more
expensive so it could be worth paying it
a little bit more to get the deeper
blacks the better colors but certainly
if you're tight on your budget the AOC
option that model is really good so if
you made a good choice if you bought
that you think if the Spiro reignite at
roots you will ever come to PC we'll put
our rigs up to their limits it freezes
it a benchmark on the highest graphics
settings interesting question Spyro
reignited I mean from what I've seen of
that video of course that games using
the Unreal Engine 4 it looks like it's
pretty much a remake closer to a remake
than a remaster it seems like everything
in the game is very similar to what it
used to be back in the old days for the
ps2 versions I think but obviously using
a brand new engine it pretty much had to
remake it so I think in that particular
game it doesn't look like would be soon
/ stressful and the GPU just judging
from sort of the assets the wiring that
sort of thing is sort of that
interesting animation style of game that
isn't usually all that stressful on GPUs
I would have thought that a game like
you know Assassin's Creed Odyssey you
sort of battlefield fives those sort of
games that tend to go for the more
realistic end of the spectrum tend to
have more GPU intensive effects using a
lot of things like screen space
reflections and you know more intense
shadows more intense your shading all
that sort of thing isn't really the case
in those more animated style games it
could be stressful will it come to PC
probably not I'd love it if it did but
probably not then again wasn't it the
crash bandicoot that did come to PC
after a while so who knows maybe what's
my guess for cyberpunk 2077 release day
well I don't know I'm really interested
in that game but I don't know yeah so
looking forward to it
what else have we got here lots of
questions guys jeez so many - so many to
get through any thoughts on color
calibrations for the del s 27:16 DGR are
you really in a tool to do color
calibration properly I mean you can sort
of if you have like a monitor that's
already calibrated you can sort of put
them side-by-side and fiddle with the
on-screen controls to sort of get them
looking the same but really you need
sort of a color eMeter which aren't
cheap so sort of calibrate it properly
so sometimes monitor manufacturers have
a driver that you can download that
installs and more accurate profile
sometimes that's the case so it's always
worth looking into there some websites
if they've already reviewed that
particular monitor might have their
profile available so check that out as
well
but there's various from the factory as
well so it doesn't always make it you
know sort of that perfect sort of how do
you put it sort of it doesn't perfectly
match the panel that you've got if you
use one of those profiles it's always
best to do it yourself
um what else have we got here which 2082
i am i running it is the founders
additional card so just the stock
standard boring or foundation card acts
have all three of the foundation cards
here the 2080 and the 2070 I don't think
I've don't think we've ever used the
2070 founders addition I certainly
haven't put into my system yet to do
anything so yeah be interested see how
that goes
any bushfires going off near you no not
the moment I don't think our weather has
been hot enough for long enough to sort
of dry out the trees and stuff to sort
of get those bushfire conditions
ready yet it's been 30 today but it
hasn't been that hot for you know days
in the past or sort of the last couple
of weeks or anything so certainly that
fire season will be heating up a bit
yeah not at the moment also go here how
good do you expect the next navi
mainstream cheap you will be pretty good
I mean it's it's interesting because
we're going to obviously get the
improvements to Amy's GP architecture
moving to 700 metres that will provide a
big performance uplift because hopefully
they'll be able to it higher
they'll be able to make it smaller
they'll be able to sort of increase
increase the amount of course if they
decide to go down that path I'm the same
sort of die size or just shrink the die
overall so yeah there's a lot of
advantages that Amy will gain they're
moving to seven nanometers but the
advantage is going to come from the
architectural changes because at the
moment I guess on seven animators
they're going to get a lot of
improvements but it's not really gonna
bring them up to the same point that in
a video is that with their 20 atti
something like maybe 64 still fair bit
slower than the 2080 TI and your Nvidia
also hasn't moved to seven nanometers
yet so you've got to sort of think you
know Amy's moving to seven animators
Nvidia is going to move to seven
animators as well so they've not only
got to sort of make Navi a GPU that
competes with the 2080 ti now but on
seven enemies it has to be faster for
their flagship product so that when
Nvidia comes with their seven in
nanometer product they're not
immediately superseded on the same
process node again so they're going to
need to make a lot of improvements to
their architecture not just Bank on
using seven animators to make Navi good
they're gonna have to change a lot of
things about that architecture because
it is quite far behind
so yeah this some fairly obvious
bottlenecks things like crops need to be
increased on their on their GPU design
so yeah hopefully there's a significant
number of changes and I would expect
that considering you know then the node
change usually brings about large
architectural changes because they
figure they can do a lot more on that
node so that's when they usually roll
out those architecture changes compared
to things like Polaris and value which
were similar nodes to the predecessors
so they didn't really feel the need to
do as much there how do you comment over
week optimization or Belfield fire for
architects technology we have a full
video on our text technology about field
five were very disappointed with it
yeah not impressed with our TX at all
very high performance hit the visual it
does look nice like don't get me wrong
it looks good it looks better than the
standard effect in a lot of aspects I
think the noise issue in some areas
especially when you're moving is quite
ugly but in some areas you know screen
space reflections have issues as well so
I think you know are ticks what DX are
effects do pretty good but at the same
time you know that performance here is
brutal and I'm not really sure whether
it's an optimization issue I just think
that that's the reality of trying to do
real-time ray tracing even on a high end
GPU like a twenty atti so yeah I'm not
sure whether there's too much more they
can do with that sort of thing so yeah
it just kind of sucks at the moment and
yeah I don't think battlefield 5 was a
great example of a game that it was well
suited to you know DXi technology would
have been better at showing the true
brand it's supposed to be coming you're
showing the Tomb Raider but yeah don't
know when that's coming unfortunately
what else we got here so what do we got
here yes Steve's telling you guys about
how it's fishing in the stream in the
comments if you wanted to see that do
you think in video will release an art X
2060 or a GTX 2060 we talked a little
bit about this in our patreon live
stream the sort of GTX r-tx 2060 thing
so first ours well I don't think they'll
put RT cos in it and it wouldn't make a
lot of sense because what we've already
seen with the art X 27
is that it's really not that capable for
ray-tracing you're talking like Ellie's
about four five like 1080p 30fps is sort
of wear out with the low setting maybe a
little bit better than that but
certainly the performance in that game
isn't great we don't expect it to be
good and sort of most other games that
would use rate racing so you thought you
hit that issue with the twenty seventy
already that rate racing in that on that
GP isn't great so you think a twenty
sixty would have you know less
processing power on the CUDA cause it's
also probably going to have less Artie
cause if they go down that path and then
you're in a situation where you're not
even getting 1080p 60fps on the lowest
settings so yeah I just don't think that
that card will come with articles they
might call it the our text we succeed by
I don't think you'll be rate racing
compatible in which case then I guess
for your question will be more like a
GTX version of the card so yeah
personally my guess I don't have any
inside information might guess what
they'll do with the 2060 is release it
as their first seven animated GP at some
time next year they should be about
ready to get those seven enemy GPUs out
I think one of their previous
generations maybe it was max well
they're released the 750 Ti I believe
don't quote me exactly on that maybe the
750 Ti was the first on the newer
process node I think 14 enemies at the
time so they brought down to that
product first the meaty part and then
their next generation high-end products
also were on that newer process node so
I wouldn't be surprised if they did that
with the 1060 you're a product or
something around that so yeah that's
sort of my guess for what they'll do but
you know I'm not hundred percent sure
what's gonna happen superjet question
here from luck a you are you guys coming
down to IEM Sydney 2019 um pretty
unlikely we didn't go to I am this year
because it's more than that sort of
eSports pace which is really something
we don't cover a lot of on hardware box
is probably not super up our wheelhouse
so we're probably not going to attend
that unfortunately it's nice that there
is an event in Sydney but yeah we were
at pax Australia in Melbourne briefly
but I am yeah probably not gonna go and
we're going to
Computex if you fly to Taiwan so will we
meet you guys at Taiwan probably not but
you know if you say come and say hi to
us feel free will we see Pascale /
cheering BIOS editor know quite
comfortably say envy is walked down
there by us fully very unlikely we'll
see them let people change the BIOS
anytime soon they don't want people
messing around with it you can already
see with the voltage slider for
overclocking that Nvidia doesn't want
people to mess with anything really with
their card so I'd be very surprised if
they have a BIOS editor for those
products so yep which is probably not
going to happen I would think what
others
how is the battery life on the Dell XPS
15 with cable 1832 20 it's been a while
since I've tested that but the back life
was fine
I wouldn't say it was amazing or
anything it certainly got the job done
but the main thing about that product
was the faster than normal integrated
graphics in that product the still
didn't think it was as good a sort of
ei7 a 758 laptops that like a gtx 1060
in them or there abouts so it was an
interesting product but certainly not
yeah certainly not the most interesting
of all laptops unfortunately is 85
degrees Celsius safe yeah it should be
shouldn't have any problems with that I
wouldn't have thought so yeah fun stuff
there is the MSI r-tx 27 t gaming Z good
for 1440p high settings yes
gr text where 70 is sort of in that GT X
1080 bracket as well if you sort of
compare it to Pascal that's very capable
1440p high settings card so yep should
have absolutely no problems with the ITX
2070 there maybe not high settings 1440p
with ray-tracing but certainly with
regular settings do you think there'll
be any affordable good HDR monitors at
CES maybe we're sort of seeing the acer
has got some more some of those 4k high
refresh hgr models coming out this month
I think descent is now December now
isn't it yeah so first so yeah this
month we might be seeing some more from
Acer and then potentially some from
Samsung at CES that's usually a big time
we see Samsung released new monitors so
hopefully we see some affordable a class
that's hard to say because you know
monitors tend to be released at any and
all times of the year there are so many
models released throughout the year that
you can sort of say you know CES is a
time of their release that but then yeah
we might see more more as all throughout
the year I'll be hoping for it though
the question about good HD other we
really need those you know full array
local dimming back lights I still seem
to be quite expensive hopefully we see
more even good anslee
might cut the muscle but yeah that's
just an issue with these sort of Morris
at the moment that we're not seeing
those sort of maximum back lights at the
moment
geez this chat is moving fast hard to
keep up with all you guys thanks to all
the questions of course and big thanks
to all you guys who've supported
hardware unbox as well
we just passed 300 thousand subscribers
so yeah bit of a master and for us too
you have one box thank you all who watch
our videos watch this live stream watch
all the content on our channel mine and
Steve Steve as well is very very chuffed
to be at this sort of stage that weren't
300 thousand subscribers so yeah thanks
to everyone who support us throughout
the journey what else we got here
why CPU clock speed more important the
CPU course
well isn't really I mean it depends on
the workload of course CPU cores can be
more important for you know a thing like
video encoding or I think like rendering
that favors you know scalability across
course I mean more cause is more
advanced advantageous than a lower core
count higher clock CPU obviously the
goal is to get both high Cox and high
core counts then you get sort of the
best of both worlds but certainly for
things like gaming which don't
necessarily scale their thread count to
the levels that you see you know doesn't
utilize all the threads that it can
utilize on modern CPUs then you sort of
see that they become thread limited so
then they become CPU clock speed limited
and that's when you see you know Intel
CPUs pulling away from Rison in you know
in sepia limited situations because you
see that clock speed advantage really
coming into play because it simply can't
the games simply can't push it out to
more cores which is why you see for that
particular workload that clock speeds
more advantageous then again as I said
for rendering cause are probably the the
best thing to have at the moment
is Steve coming to say hi any time
during this dream is that certain
questions in the chat he pops is his the
Steve guy that you see in the chat from
time to time but he leaves a two hour
drive for me and it completely different
part of the state so probably not going
to come over just to sit and watch a GPU
run heaven for the next 48 hours
probably not the most exciting thing to
come over and say hi for so yeah what
else is going on
any plans to review the LG 32 mu 99 - w
now let me just google this monitor
because there are so many monitors I
don't necessarily remember all of them
ah this one yes very expensive monitor
the 4k IPS Ultra HD one again probably
not going to review it considering when
it was released but I it looks like a
pretty decent monitor but again $2,000
pretty expensive so yeah interesting one
there one of the people in our discord
chat saying at the moment few people go
into bed because yeah we started this at
10 p.m. so yeah fun stuff
what else have we got here
yeah maybe I will put a timer inside oh
I can put a timer into the chat let me
see if I can get something like that up
because that'd be good for you guys to
be able to see what's going on here so
bear with me guys well just try and get
a timer into the frame somewhere let me
see whether we can actually do this
should be possible surely surely they
make this stuff easy okay now I can get
a capture going one of these things
should be able to do it
not that obviously because that doesn't
work okay I'll get that working again
let's go back to some questions we'll
get that working at some point okay what
other question is have we actually let's
check the thermals because we'll be
running it now for about 45 minutes and
I've got the thermocouple over here
let's have a look what is it saying
still sitting in about that 73 degrees
on the back plate so that's play sort of
right around that memory area where else
is it saying yeah 53 degrees exhaust air
temperature we've got 37 degrees case
ambient and about 24 degrees and being
in the room at the moment so that is
what is happening at the moment what
else let me try to get this capture
thing going again
okay just bear with me as I get up this
little thing here we can will this work
Wow that's not good all right grats on
the 300k thanks v po po p o je
interesting name they're not really try
to pronounce that pod yeah tell us how
you pronounce your name in the chat
because yeah thanks for the super chat
though yeah we're very proud to be a
300k thanks as well to Game Boy 3800 who
also donated some super chat to us a
little while back sorry that I missed
that early in the chat yeah again very
very happy to be at 300 K at the moment
spin yes sort of a milestone for us and
very happy to be at be there at the
moment do you think chip books is going
to shift the paradigm for semiconductor
design
yes gonna be a big big thing for the
semiconductor industry to sort of get it
we've already seen that with Amy's
upcoming CPU design we'll certainly yeah
I think the main thing we'll do is that
as we get to those smaller small nodes
we're gonna run into more and more yield
issues trying to get these chips you
know running I guess and as you sort of
try and make those chips larger and
larger you're under the issue of yeah
we're at smaller nodes so yields are
gonna be potentially worse and then we
try to make the chips bigger so yours
are gonna be sort of doubly worse with
both of those things so I think you run
into that sort of issue when you're sort
of thinking about designing new chips so
the way this or tapping those by make
these multi chip designs instead of
making the chips really be so I split
them up pick them up using these
interconnect technologies I think that
really will make a big change for not
just CPS but GPUs as well as they start
to figure out ways to sort of split out
some of the themes you know potentially
they could split out you know what are
they call them you compute units from
the GPUs into its own babies separate
packages and then they'll really allow
them to scale big and still keep those
yields up which will keep costs down so
I think it really will be a big big
innovation for yeah for the market
yeah okay still can't get this display
caption let's see if this works
gratz of 300k cutting-edge retro thanks
for the super chat there as well
I'm only 290 8700 behind you guys well
it's always nice to start a YouTube
channel as you're doing it for fun you
can have a lot of fun doing YouTube
that's our Steve started you know the
whole YouTube thing with hard round box
just to do it for a little bit of fun to
see where it went and you never know
where you can go after sort of building
that up for a while a while
so his window capture to actually
working because for me doesn't look like
there's anything happening so yeah just
don't know why that isn't working but
whatever it doesn't really matter
Eric Chong thanks for the ten dollars
through super chair as a realistic test
could you play sieve six and try for a
culture victory that would take you 48
hours probably yeah my god playing sieve
six and trying to get any of the
victories that aren't the space race
always finds it is super challenging
certainly the culture victory is yeah I
thought domination as well if you're
playing on the high difficulties and you
disable all the ways of winning except
for domination then it becomes really
really difficult to sort of win that
game without cheating
I certainly have to think about your
strategy so yeah I love civilization 6 I
think it's really one of those my
favorite strategy games
I think civilization 4 was probably a
slightly better game as far as the
civilization games go but 6 was better
than 5 by a long way in my opinion so
yes certainly one of my favorite
favorite games there
okay what else have we got here
can you guys do a video on how to
calibrate a moderate yes I've been
that's I've got this big long list of
videos to do obviously there's lots of
things we really want to do on the
channel that we can't always do because
of time reasons I really want to get
something out of how to calibrate a mind
just as a sort of educational video
might not be the biggest video ever view
wise but certainly I think there's it's
very confusing once you open up the
utilities that show you how to do the
calibration on sort of all the things to
do it especially calm and fire that we
use which is cam and five is sort of the
industry standard professional tool that
you would use for things like you know
if you're in a Hollywood studio or
something you're trying to get all your
monitors calibrated that you watch what
you're filming on that's certainly the
sort of gold standard there's also a
utility called display Cal that's open
source it doesn't have quite the feature
set the Cal Man five does but it has a
lot of you know sort of basic features
as well so that's certainly an option
that we might consider doing that in a
separate video we would cover maybe both
of those things you can purchase Cal man
5 if you want it's pretty expensive for
the top models but I think top version
sorry it's not a piece of hair it's a
piece of software so yeah any
suggestions for a color code 4k monitor
preferably 100% of derby RGB you should
be looking at NEC monitors that's a good
brand also dell ultrasharp
from their premier color line they're
not cheap you'll be looking at for 4k
with accuracy by Delta under 2.0 and
100% RGB looking at over a thousand US
dollars so not the cheapest but
certainly certainly something to yeah
keep in mind for that
what else we got going at the moment huh
it's very warm in this room at the
moment very warm I think it's really
without any ventilation in here it
should it will cool down overnight I
think but certainly cuz it's been 30
degrees it's probably still about 26
degrees outside at the moment yeah we'll
certainly be certainly sweating here
hydrate myself guys
ah okay some super Jets have come in
thanks for the people that are
supporting us through the super chat
feature okay first one here was from
novel fame so if I screwed up your name
there novell oh yeah something like that
thanks to the five bucks would you wait
for Zen to slash new Vega or build now
have already have decent five year old
system five year olds okay interesting
um would you wait or build now it
depends what you're doing it so I think
if you're aiming to have a high-end
gaming PC you should be looking at Intel
you know we while rising is very well
balanced great value for money in a lot
of product segments I think that you
know even something like an eighty seven
hundred K today still provides a lot of
very sort of 1080p high refresh gaming
with the high performance GPU you know
so if you're sort of going to be CPU
bottleneck you should be looking at sort
of Intel processor so I think if you are
going down that path and building that
higher gaming rig and you sort of
weren't necessarily as interested in in
rise and then and you wanted that
performance right now than something
like that
you know that's fine you can pull the
system right now be probably be very
happy with it again those into is
probably only four or five months away
if we're sort of thinking you know they
launched rise in second gen it's sort of
april of this year so if we think April
next year that's four or five months
away so if you can wait that long which
again is almost like half a generation
in terms of product cycle then short
that's probably a good thing that you
could be waiting for and again I think
as well if you're more into sort of your
content creation they were sort of in
that midpoint now between second gen
Rises you can get like a twenty seven
hundred X and you probably be very happy
with that but again sort of wait a
little bit see what's happening with
sendto and I certainly think as well
would be getting a better idea of what
AMD's consumer products will be looking
at at CES they're planning a big event
at CES to talk about seven animated
products and hopefully we'll get a
better idea of what will sort of be
looking at for as enter in the consumer
front there so yeah I mean I'll probably
sort of consider waiting for that as for
new Vega if you're thinking about Navi
there again I think right now we're not
really sure how long those GPUs will be
it could still be six months of
in which case again you're missing it
you might be missing out in that six
months of extra performance you beget in
which case you know there's some really
good values on the market at the moment
not necessarily something like a 20 80
GI but certainly in that vague of 56:10
780ti or even lower price tiers there's
good cars there so yeah there's
certainly lots of options certainly
interesting stuff there
Jesse also had a super chat here any
idea when the refreshed court x-series
CPS will be available the 99 20x mainly
should we expect refreshed mobos
releasing alongside them so yeah there
are fresh cracks which I'm assuming
you've approached to the Intel skylake X
refresh or whatever they called that
thing the 999 20x yeah I mean we've seen
reviews of them that don't seem to be
available still so I would certainly
expect them to be available before the
end of the year considering you know
when these companies push out reviews of
these product simple chat samples it
certainly means that they're going to be
available very shortly it might depend
on how they're Zeon's are going usually
they would be using similar silicon for
their zeal and so that might depend
especially for some of the lower end
products they've already released the
1980 XC for example so the lower end
ones might still be a little while away
but I will certainly be expecting those
to be coming very shortly and certainly
this month maybe I'll be thinking it
should be around the mark should we
expect refresh motherboards released
alongside them yes a few companies are
planning on releasing refresh X 299
motherboards those shouldn't be
radically different from what we've seen
already simply because you know the CPUs
themselves very similar there's no real
you know major improvements there you
know there's not really any new features
that they could be adding in but could
be seeing things like beefing variants
we just have to wait and see what's
going on with that sort of product in
the future so yeah certainly I'd be
expecting both of those things shortly
Samsonite douve or doves Samsonite dove
man it's getting late I'm getting tired
I miss for mispronouncing things like
dove what am i doing alright rise on
lunch April eighteenth this year this is
our super chair by the way so thanks for
that
Rison launch April eighteenth this year
may 1st 2019 is a
fiftieth anniversary so it's a pretty
good bet for rice until release date
yeah that would make perfect sense if
they've certainly got a big anniversary
coming up to launch what will probably
be there I guess you'd have to say sort
of that most highly I mean Rison is very
highly anticipated as well but this
could really be that sort of big step up
for for AMD not to just your elisa
product that's way better than FX but
release a product that's highly
competitive with intel on every front
not just your price to performance but
also having those higher clock speeds
having that good AVX performance having
those instruction sets that match what
Intel currently has in their
architectures that's still you know
obviously a little bit behind Intel on
those regards to the moon but I think
Zen Center Rison 3 will really beef up a
lot of that stuff so to have that
product launching a 50th anniversary
which are less would worry about so
thanks for notifying me that would be
yeah really good bet so I think that's
probably going to be around the money
again they could push it earlier simply
because you know product release cycles
they might think early is better they
might really some sort of product they
might for example go with maybe rise in
5 or maybe a rise in 7 it doesn't
necessarily have all the calls released
those first then come out with on May
1st with that sort of flagship rising 3
Scoob who knows that's all speculation
at the moment all right back to the
regular chat thanks for those super
chats there Tim what microphones use we
use the rode nt1 - a both Siva no use
the rode nt1 - it's a great microphone
it sort of it's a cardioid microphone
and all a lot of people use shotgun mics
which have to point directly into your
face to sort of you know get those in
but with the cardioid mic we can sort of
sit up here and that sort of gets this
whole area so whether I'm seen in the
middle or whether Steve and I both here
for our Q&amp;amp;A videos we can just use the
one mic and it's really crisp audio
quality and the benefit there as well
Road is an Australian company and they
produce some really high-quality
microphone it's been using a lot of
their products over the years and yeah
we highly rate it so it's great
microphone now the super chaps come in
from less peck are you guys going to
check out the gigabyte water force
2080 I have one but I'm still a month
off finishing my build can see the temps
we're very keen to test
product that your companies are willing
to send us obviously there's concerns
about I guess at the moment you know the
2080 was already released you know a
while back now so any reviews that we do
have specific cards might not have the
interest that they would have had around
that launch time frame for gigabyte
they've already as well they've already
provided us a lot of different cards
we've got at least 220 ATT eyes from
them the Auris one the Norris one I'm
not quite sure what we have on the other
ones you have to are Steve but certainly
you know companies aren't might not be
willing to sort of provide all those
products to us at what so yeah if
gigabyte if you're watching this dream
or you for some reason clicked on this
dream send Steve a water force 2080 I'm
sure he'd be interested in checking it
out but yeah it just depends on what
companies sort of willing to offer us at
the moment we're not going to go out and
sort of hunt new GPUs at the Mona Lisa
sort something massively unique about
them but yeah we might get more of these
cards and as they sort of come on to the
market do you think AMD would make ray
tracing as triplets in the future and
that's a really interesting question I
would imagine that their next GPU
architecture will have some sort of
accelerated ray tracing
whether they do that in RT cos similar
to Nvidia or whether they just have
their own maybe they just have one type
of you know accelerated core they've got
to do things like deep learning
operations that sort of thing that might
be something that they look at doing
with navi's having that part of their
GPU beefed up to do ray tracing in there
as well I'd be surprised if we saw
triplets with Navi I would think that
would be for a future generation we
don't know at this stage but I'll be
surprised if they rolled out for their
next generation who knows of course but
I would think that yeah it could be a
possibility that they would split out
sort of the main shader processes and
the deep learning processes into its own
core and that will also give benefits in
sort of making those deep learning cards
they could have you know one card that
has all the shader cores on or just
shader course on it for gaming or
potentially for those your data center
applications that don't necessarily need
the deep learning processing
capabilities
then you could have the second die that
would have the you know RT cause the
accelerated you know the integer
processing to sort of enter into 4 into
8 sort of stuff that could have done on
a separate die you put the two days
together for a compute card you put the
two days together for a high end GPU
that has that ray tracing capability and
yeah so I think that's certainly
something that would be happening at the
moment what else is happening still lots
of questions here guys thanks for
sending them all in and thanks for
watching the stream it's been certainly
interesting so far nothing much has
happened on the old card at the moment
so no problems I wouldn't expect any
problems at this point anyway what else
have we got sure by 2700 X away from X
rise and the edges cover that the
previous question I think you could
potentially be looking at waiting for
rising but again you're probably waiting
like four or five months now so it's
that trade-off between do I buy now to
get known performance now and have that
extra five months with my new product or
do I wait to see how much better is n 2
is going to be and I certainly think at
current prices
ambhi's rice and processes are very
attractive to buy right now so yeah
certainly wouldn't be super certainly
would be super devastated I wouldn't
afford if you're bored of that CPU at
the moment have you thought of comparing
the 2700 X versus the 99 100k in games I
think we already have a video up on the
channel on that certainly we should have
one Steve will let you know if you're
still on the chat knocks off use but
yeah we certainly have done a lot of
content on that sort of thing or Ray and
as Sal says in the chest yeah I think
people should wait for CES I think
that's probably a very good thing to
sort of mention that again
AMD are sort of planning that big 7
nanometre announcement for CES which is
right the start of January so if you
were sort of tossing up should I buy now
should I wait you certainly get a good
idea of what's to come in January so
yeah it could be worth that one month
wait and then you sort of have a really
good idea but again pricing for some of
those
at the moment is still quite good so it
is stuff probably something to sort of
keep an eye out on at the moment what
else is happening at the moment what if
the card dies yeah good question what if
the card dies yeah we'll have to RMA it
I mean we're not overclocking it so
we're not running it out of
specifications
so the card should be fine we if you
watch the intro to this video your real
description we firmly believe the card
won't die it's just a matter of you know
if there's any issues will there crop up
after it's specifically runny for this
long will they be degradation the
components I think the the main thing
we're thinking with the card is you know
is running the the memory dies in
particular at like say 80 degrees or 90
degrees on the actual die temperature is
that going to that might not cause a
problems right now it might not cause
problems if you are going to be playing
a game for say three or four hours but
what if you're running up those super
hot temperatures for 48 hours and that's
caused enough degradation in the card
that to the point where when you turn on
the next time the components aren't
necessarily exactly the same you know
they've cooled down you warm up again
then if something's gone wrong with them
and that's sort of what I think might
have happened with Hardware CPUs card
which was sort of based on this test on
and that's what if it's going to fail
that's probably how it's going to fail
and because we're just running it stock
you know in views got no choice ago to
accept our ami so yeah that's pretty
much why we're running stock that's what
we think would happen if it fails again
we don't expect it to fail we've seen no
problems with the car up to this point
but we just think that you know if
something is going to go wrong that
could be the reason why is simply
running it for out of potentially
slightly out of its specification for a
long time might cause damage that you
accept that you would accelerate in a
48-hour period that you might not see
from gaming in shorter periods well so
you got here
yes it is 11 p.m. at the moment 11 p.m.
so yeah look I probably wouldn't be
doing anything else exciting at the
moment so getting our live stream with
our hardware box audience to celebrate
as well passing 300k subscribers it's a
good thing it's a good thing to chat
with you guys
gak qin 64 gak Jin 64 I believe they are
one of our patreon embers as well so
thanks to the super chat they say I
would be would it be cheating if you
open the window a little bit to cool the
car yes that would be cheating I might
consider telling the fan speed up on the
dark bass 700 reasons as a fan speed
normal Marcus it turned up a little bit
from some of our early testing we saw
turning it up doesn't make a significant
difference in the temperatures we're
sort of looking at more like that maybe
what I said maybe like a three to four
degree difference but yeah we'd sort of
feel the sight modes probably a little
bit better for this dream while the
microphone still on so yeah mate in
Australia am i exhausted not really
didn't have the greatest sleep but you
know it's been been out and about today
took the dog to the dog beach in the
nice weather and that was a lot of fun
it was packed there lots of dogs so and
dog got super tired yeah fun stuff and
all of those guys saying I look tired
would you have said that I look tired if
I didn't tell you that it was 11 p.m.
this time I think I look perpetually
tired that's what some people say so
well the 22 atti go down in price soon I
wouldn't think so because it's their
flagship card maybe with that RTX Titan
that we've seen some sort of leaks and
teaser sort of things about maybe that
will caught they'll push that up to some
other $1,200 mark and then push the 2080
ti down to 900 would be nice but
thinking of Nvidia they'll probably just
release the r-tx Titan at 1500 bucks and
call it a day so yeah that's pretty much
what's happening here
I think this experiment is okay but I
don't think any cheaper you can stay at
85 degrees Celsius for eight hours or
more I think that's a common
misconception with these products there
they're built in a way that has these
fail-safes built in so the 85 degrees
Celsius or 86 degree Celsius limit on
the card is meant to keep it from
burning itself out over time they're
designed the engineers designed that
limits specifically so if you run the
card at Full Tilt for a long period of
time that you you know don't kill the
card certainly if you remove the limit
in some way and get it to run let's say
a hundred degrees then it might kill the
card but the limit is there for a reason
and it's for these situations where you
run up for a long period of time it has
these fail-safes built in specifically
for that so yeah that's pretty much
again I don't think it'll die but we'll
see we'll see best processor for
streaming if you're talking about game
streaming you're probably looking at I
mean the 900 K is quite expensive but
certainly because it's both a good
gaming CPU has you know the benefit of
both hi single thread performance and
also many cause the same amount of cores
of the 2700 X you'll be looking at that
sort of as probably the pinnacle for
game streaming we'll do some more
testing on now in the channel ah it
might even be at weaning RT at this
point hopefully we can get something out
on that in 2018 but we will be looking a
bit more into that sort of game
streaming stuff the thread Ripper 2950 X
is also quite a good option because
there has similar performance in games
to the 2,700 X but you simply get those
extra 16 you know you get the extra 8
cores for 16 in total and that makes it
again a highly attractive option for
gaming so and streaming so yeah again it
just does depend on sort of the things
that you're doing at the moment yes -
exposed the Titan RT Xbox last night on
LTE yeah was that deliberate or was that
an accident let us know in the comments
what you think about that I'm I'm
probably being that was deliberate but
certainly it's um yeah interesting to
say I mean it was
it's gonna be the case that there would
be a Titan card you you were to assume
there'd be a Titan out here he's got the
one thing I would be really hoping that
the time card brings specifically is
that full RT the full amount of RT
course being unlocked which would likely
mean the whole GPU is unlocked which the
twenty NCOs cut down slightly I think
those extra RT cores could give you that
little bit more performance for a Tracey
if you are one of the people that was
really interested in that though you got
a super chat from hammer time
guns are blaze thank you very much for
the $30.00 there Congrats I've been
following you guys for a while I'm
thankful to you and Steve the amazing
content the huge amount of benchmarks
and for being honest reviewers thank you
very much we work long hours Steven
particular works very hard on his
content his GPU benchmarks that stuff
you know it doesn't take hit that it's
not a short amount of time to get like a
50 GPU benchmark out so we really
appreciate that you guys appreciate the
effort that we put in you know we
wouldn't be doing this sort of stuff if
you guys didn't think that what we're
doing is good and if you guys didn't
watch it so yeah thanks for all the
support throughout the years Hema dudes
I'm thinking of buying a 1440p minor
monitor but run some games at 1080p does
it look bad because it's not a native
reference to Manos de Souza rog swift PG
2 7 9 q will look bad yes yes it will
when you sort of compare side-by-side of
1080p native display to a 1440p display
running at 1440p you certainly see that
there's a big step up from 1080 P to
1440p but if you put that 1440p monitor
on 1080p it will look significantly
worse than the 1080p monitor and it's
simply because of a non-native scan has
to approximate it's not like one pixel
going to four pixels like you would see
running 1080p to 4k which still doesn't
look great in some situations but in
this situation it's like one pixel going
to you know two pixels and because the
pixels are in a good alignment you're
not really getting that perfect sort of
scaling so yeah it's certainly not
recommended I think if you
are planning on running games at 1080p
I'm assuming you might have like a
performance limitation there then you
should just stick with your 1080p
monitor or if you are if you do go and
buy that monitor then you should run it
as many times as you possibly can you
should be running in at 1440p and you
should be there I turned down the
settings for some of the things another
good trick potentially is to in some
games have the render slider like the
resolution scale slider what I'd be
doing is you know still rendering the
game native resolution so you know you
get your UI native res you get Windows
at native raised at 1440p but then if
you turn down that resolution slider to
something like 90 percent which isn't
going to be 1080p performance it's going
to be you know a bit bit worse in 1440p
you'll get that improving your
performance the image will look a bit
softer but it certainly won't look as
bad as 1080p on a 1440p display and yeah
there's a few other people say the same
thing about that issue there Tim do you
think Nvidia are going to a Titan big T
and a Titan little T like last year yeah
the Titan X big pan X little P I don't
think so I think the reason for that is
when Nvidia released the Titan X Pascal
which was the time next big P that
wasn't that GPU fully unlocked the GPU
that they were using for that you know
it was the same as the 1080i so it was
cut down slightly but was still more
powerful than the 1080 so I think if
they were going to do is sort of big
little lettering again there's not
really a lot of room to grow they could
release a Titan X or Titan whatever
RTX Titan for example that has the same
performance as the tenets the 20 atti
the same core configuration but there
would be a lot of reason to buy it
because the 20 80 is already released so
I think what they would what they're
really only you have an option to do is
sort of release that fully unlocked GPU
with a couple of extra you know compute
units enabled a couple of extra RT cos
and all that stuff enabled call that the
RT X tight and that's what I would
imagine they would do and then there's
really no room to release that little P
model in the future because therefore
you release the sort of maximum they can
go on that diet for cheering so
that's why I think would probably happen
at the moment I need some water
at the moment it's interesting speaking
by yourself for 75 minutes it's a fun
stuff
I recently bought a Vegas 64 and I'm
having weed issues in some games where
the card sits at about 80% usage and is
dropping frames no CPU bottleneck and
not too hot any ideas why so the first
thing that I'd be looking at you know
you might think there's no CPU
bottleneck but for example are you
running on like a Rison processor where
you know 50 or 40 percent utilization is
fairly common certainly the CPU doesn't
need to be running at a hundred percent
to run into a CPU bottleneck you can you
know you might not be using other cause
new CPU so that's the first thing I also
be looking at there the next thing could
be things like sort of your memory
speeds your games can be memory
bandwidth limited before they really
before they hit those issues with either
CPU or GPU storage limitations is worth
you sort of if you're getting into an
area for example that you're starting to
stream in a lot of you know say geometry
of our textures so you're running fast
through an area to try and do a lot of
stuff then you might get those drops
where your GPU set moves down to sort
about 80% your CPUs not bottlenecked
we're sleeping bottleneck but other
things in the system so again you can
also yeah just check out those different
things that's probably why you're
beginning that if you're getting 80%
utilization is dropping frames all of
the time that costs to be something like
a software configuration issue that's
sort of all those sort of things I'd be
thinking about for there why is no one
talking about damp down sampling anymore
please explain how this works and why
for example GTA almost looks like a
native 4k would use a 1080p monitor with
four times down sampling or super simple
I think super stomachs probably better
word to use then the down sampling so
first of all it doesn't really look the
same as a 4k monitor
I mean native 4k you get more data on
the screen it depends how far where
you're viewing from the monitor as well
that makes a big difference but yes so
super sampling you're simply adding more
pixel data and combine into one pixel so
each pixel is essentially like a better
pixel it's a it's kind of a bad way sort
of sites of better pixels don't really
tell you all that much but because
you're having it's actually doing more
work and it's rendering it out of scene
and then sort of compressing it down you
get things like sharper textures if you
rendering native 1080p you know it
renders the textures just you know 1080p
renders all of it everything in the
screen 1080p especially things like thin
wires and stuff you get a little bit of
aliasing there and when you sort of
sample that when you blow that up and
then shrink it down you get that
advantage of you know that cleaner lines
and everything because it has simply
more data to work with they can do some
clever things than the down sampling
sort of smooth it out and make it look
nice just make it look sharper if what
you see the same thing happening when
you take an image and you sort of if
it's a nice and high-resolution use
shrink it down looks really nice and
sharp everything's clean and clear and
that's simply because you know in a game
when you're rendering it native
resolution not everything is like super
crisp and clear just because of the way
it has to render stuff and yeah just
sort of the harsher fingers get smoothed
out a little bit more when you do that
sort of down sampling what else have we
got
yeah any info of course that open-loop
cooling unfortunately not it looks cool
I'm interested in checking it out but at
the moment no real word on that at the
moment I had a 1066 gigabyte before the
same PC otherwise had absolutely no
problems in the same areas that was the
same person before with the Vegas 64
bottleneck again Vegas 64 is a lot
faster than a 1066 gigabyte so the
issues that you were seeing there you
might have just been fully GPU bound on
your 1066 a good bite you look great -
Vegas 64 and suddenly you've those ball
necks and more prisons and they were
previously so you just check out some of
those things um yeah what else have we
got in the chat will you test and 99
hundred K with the B 360 motherboard
probably not I think if you're getting
in yeah it's one of those things where
you probably shouldn't buy a 99 hundred
K if you've got a B 360 motherboard cuz
you can't overclock it one of the key
advantages of having that K means you
can overclock it and certainly I think I
wanna be through 64 it's probably
wouldn't be suitable for the 900 counts
into the v-ray
potentially raining tissues at stock so
yeah it's one of those things where we
sort of don't figure a lot of people
would be pairing up their 500 or Plus
CPU it's like an
entry level B 360 motherboard we think
if you're buying it high high in CPU
you're gonna be buying a motherboard
that is suitable for it as well so I
think that's kind of where we're sort of
sitting there with that greeting is what
is your experience with Electrical
buzzing noises on custom art x28 ET i'm
roars you've tested so far as yeah you
might be talking a little about Coraline
now other issues going to that and yes
we have experienced that a little bit
some of our founders additional models
do it the 2080 ti I don't think does it
I think mate was the 2080
that does it a little bit in terms of
it's getting a little bit that Coraline
the gigabyte model certainly has a
little bit of that buzzing but it does
also depend on the utilization sometimes
you'll pump it up to 100% utilization
get that coil whine initially and then
it's fine sometimes you get it for
longer period so yes pretty annoying
it's not something that you normally see
on cards certainly a lot of the Pascal
cards that I have don't have that issue
so yeah unfortunate thing but that's
just the way it is Tim will you ever
cover VR performance for CPU and GPU um
the UH performance there's a lot of
interesting things about VI you know you
can look at just the raw framerate that
you're getting out of GP but that
doesn't tell you a lot about things like
you sort of the latency that's coming to
the VR headset that stuff's a little bit
more difficult to tell that has a big
influence on your VR experience you know
you want to make sure that your inputs
are coming straight through to their
actual headset and the display in the
headset as quickly as possible and yeah
we're simply I mean I'll probably do
have the tools to test it but they are
still not a super wide audience thing
and a lot of things we still try and
test on the channel the things that
appeal to sort of the wider PC
enthusiast community so hopefully we get
to a point where there's a YouTube
channel out there that covers VR stuff
like that really well there probably is
I don't not really super begin to be out
myself so Ivan really looked into that
all that much but yeah probably not
something they were looking too much
into at the moment is this stream gonna
be for 48 hours
yes I'm not gonna be speaking for 48
hours I'll be speaking until I
like going to bed and they will just
focus in on the screen running I'll be
super boring mode for the 48 hours and
yeah we'll probably check around from
time to time sometimes you might check
back into the stream I'll be popping in
to check on it to see what the
temperatures are I like that and all of
that and yeah just purchase myself an
MSI 2080 Treo x4 819 pounds and a ten
percent rebate do you think this is
still a good deal over 1080i I'm not
really familiar with the British pricing
for GPUs so normal is roughly similar to
the US in terms of like dollar to pound
so if you looking at $800 for a 2080
that's not terrible the issue now is a
1080 eyes don't exist in the market
they're sort of you know they're fully
gone pretty much so I'd be thinking out
of 19 yeah that's it's not it's not bad
it's not bad
it'll be nice if they get to that $700
price point I would be sort of a really
good good price to that at the moment
I'm gonna check the Sal says 1080 eyes
are typically 750 to 800 pounds before
they all vanish so if they're on that
seven attributed to an Aurora pound prot
price and you're getting at 28 for the
same price getting that's pretty good I
mean 28 28 E is similar performance of
1080i so yeah not bad it's not a bad
price let's check these temperatures
so it's still fairly similar on the
temperatures as what we've been running
for the past hour or so so we're at
about 73 degrees still on the back
plates that's directly on the back near
the memory we're also still getting I
think was about 54 degrees from the
exhaust out of the GPU and about 37
degrees case ambient at the moment and
it's still about 24 degrees in here so
yes 86 degrees still on the GPU itself
but that back plate temperature is
certainly pretty scorching in the moment
so if you think the back plate itself is
70 degrees or 72 or three or whatever I
said just before then you're internally
on those FETs and stuff inside that on
that piece of media a lot that stuff
could be cooking quite hot yeah all
right this guy's been asking you about
the LG 24mp 88 HV I will finally answer
your question sorry I've been missing it
let's have a look at the monitor and
actually see what it is because I
haven't heard of it before looks fairly
old so looks like it's been out on the
market for a few years now which means
we're probably pretty unlikely review it
we tend to stick to new products simply
because if you're at least a review of
something that's older today doesn't
necessarily get the traction it once was
it actually looks like a fairly good
model it looks like it's got slim bezels
IPS as well nine laps in srgb so I mean
besides its helped in the specs we would
ideally like to test this more on up but
yeah so yeah to answer your question
probably you won't be testing that we'll
be sticking to newer monitors for at the
moment
well so you got here to me your skin is
getting more pale with the minute get
some sleep mate really I hope not maybe
it's just the lighting in here I think
I'm still doing okay you vlg 32 GK 950
GF - be ultra wide yeah would really
like to review that line I don't have
super good contacts at LG in terms of
gang LG - in at the moment so I would
like to work a bit more closely with LG
that's one of the main monitor companies
that we don't have super close ties with
we do work with most of them but it's
them and Samsung that we sort of not
quite as you know what work is tightly
with them as we do with some mostly
companies like you know biotech a sous
viewsonic bank you until they kicked us
out Philips that sort of thing I've
missed out a bunch of companies there
that we work with monitors but yeah we
work with most time except LG and
Samsung so yeah yeah issue with the
paleness as well as I'm seen closer to
one of my lights I've got two lights
there there when I sit in the middle
it's a bit more bounce with the light
I'm assuming the edges it's a bit briar
in my eyes so yeah
would you get an ITX Titan or wait until
next string cards no I wouldn't get it
tight and they're always too expensive
yeah it's always just worth it to get
the TI models gram right asks why did
Ben Q kick you out so well didn't really
kick us out at the the they just
basically stopped talking to us so you
would have seen we might have seen I did
a review of the bank you something it's
over there Ben QTL el2 870 you Thank You
L 2 XM news so this was a 4k monitor
that claimed to have HDR was a TN panel
it was reasonably affordable but
basically I said the model wasn't very
good
I gave it a negative review generally I
thought it was too expensive I think one
of the reasons for that was that they
were basically selling it as an HDR
monitor and charging a premium for HDR
but really no aspect of its performance
is actually yeah it had you know SDR
contrast it cut its colors didn't go
above srgb and its brightness was like 4
less than 400 nits so you get that issue
where I didn't recommend it because it
was just too expensive you know we're
all about value products here and it was
yeah just not a good value product so
yeah basically Bank you saw the review
they got back to us this they wanted to
get in touch and ask us a few questions
which is fairly typical when you get
when you do a negative review of any
product you know the company will come
back to you and be like we just need to
get some clarification on a few things
you said but basically Bank you did that
I responded like you have my reasoning a
basically just said most of the stuff I
you know talked about is in the review
so you can go and watch that and then
yeah I was supposed to receive another
monitor from then which was a 32-inch
144 Hertz variant didn't hear anything
from them after that about getting that
monitor in it was pretty much supposed
to be sent by the time but weeks before
that point I sent some emails I was like
hey I'm like you know gonna get this
monitor am I gonna review it and they
were basically never heard anything back
from them I didn't hear anything back
from them after I sent him my list of
reasons and explanations to them some
informational HDR stuff and there were
keen on hearing I thought you know it's
always positive when a company comes
back to you and they say you know we
want to improve our products but keen on
getting your feedback and you just
clarify a few things about this you know
we want to make an ex-champ products
better that's always good but then to
not get feet not to hear from them are
for that point and to sort of things to
go dark on that side in terms of getting
review samples is yeah not great so I
wouldn't expect too much more from thank
you so how fast is the fan right now
yeah it's
Auto fan speed so whatever it normally
runs that the case fans are reasonably
slow so yeah that's pretty much it at
the moment
thanks be a ap Bop for the 20 that's
interesting symbol there it's at the
rupee symbol we just have a quick google
of this yes rupee thank you very much
for the rupees there and I stab our
global audience tuning in to us on this
live stream and at the moment
have you ever gamed on an OLED TV at 120
Hertz I'm super impressed coming from an
HP omen 144 1440p 75 Hertz PC minor all
that is great like don't get me wrong
it's great technology and I haven't
personally used a high refresh all this
I'm used to 120 Hertz one but certainly
I has a lot of advantages in terms of
its colour reproduction terms of its
contrast HDR it does basically per pixel
local dimming which is fantastic but
yeah it'd be great if they brought two
miners but there's just issues with
things like burning and image retention
and power consumption that make them not
as suitable as other technologies for
monitors which is simply why we haven't
seen them used typically they're also
quite expensive and to get sort of like
a monitor size in a density that's
appropriate for a monitor is quite
difficult especially with that reverting
to like weird sub pixel array so these
are you see on phones when they use all
their displays as they often they don't
stick to a standard RGB sub pixel matrix
so the sub pixel matrix is for every
pixel in the display you have a red
and a green four on an LCD you have red
blue and green crystals and each of
those change depending on you know the
levels that you need for the color for
that particular pixel and on all LEDs at
a height at a big that a big like on a
TV even in 4k you still get that RGB for
each of the your light-emitting diodes
it in all in but once you start gaem
shrinking them down to the size of like
a smartphone you get into density issues
where you can't fit the RGB next to each
other so you get an issue where you need
to switch to some pixel arrays that
things like you know you might have one
green for two pixels you'd still have
your two Reds and your two blues we'd
have one green and that means your sub
pixel density is reduced compared to a
native RGB sub pixel Ramon around so
that's kind of the reason why we you
know you might not see all that -
there's a few reasons there I'd love to
see it come tomorrow at some point with
those problems solves but I think we're
sort of more moving towards micro LED
and mini LEDs the technologies that will
take over there which offer some of the
advantages of always like you're sort of
more finer tuned ability the ability to
more finely tune things like the
backlight for things like that and yeah
stuff like that have I used the
Thermaltake arrow 360 soft tube water
cooling kit I've not I believe Steve has
but yeah you have to you have to ask him
and yes
Sal can pentile all LEDs are gross yeah
I think I'm pent are all is I think it's
pentile is that you know one green was
either green or but I think it's green
one green sub-pixel for two pixels I
think they have some noticeable
artifacting issues we can sort of see on
the edges of like hard objects say like
text for example you can sort of see
some fringing of things like the red
pixel sort of creeping into the next
pixel the blue pixel sort of creeping
into the next one so yeah I think the
it's hard to notice on some displays but
certainly it's not as crisp and clear as
the true RGB
sub pixel erase things like a 1440p five
inched
display oled response times literally a
joke yes they're very fast 0.1
milliseconds they're crazy so fun stuff
there would you pay an extra hundred
fifty dollars for g-sync to your 144
Hertz 1440p monitor probably not it's a
probably could be a controversial
opinion considering you know a lot of
people like their gsync and I use a
g-sync monitor personally but the issue
with 1440 144 Hertz monitors is that
they're available now depending on the
size for in that 300 to 350 dollar price
bracket so you're talking about a $350
sale higher 3 250 $150 freesync monitor
compared to a you know $500 g-sync
monitor if when you add that hundred $50
on and I sort of think if the panels are
exactly the same otherwise is it worth
paying that's significant amount more
just to get adaptive sync and I think in
a lot of cases the answer is probably no
if you're a gamer that plays in the 40
to 60 FPS bracket and you've
consistently seen there you like playing
in there for whatever reason you're not
in to hire a fresh game even though
you've bought a 144 Hertz monitor then
yeah do you think it's going to improve
your experience significantly compared
to not having adaptive sync running so
in that sense yeah but spending that
extra under $50 is worth it but if
you're up in the say a hundred plus FPS
range so you're really utilizing your
144 Hertz one 1440p monitor then you're
not gonna notice as much the advantages
of adaptive sync even if you're running
with vsync on or vsync off you might get
a bit of tearing but it's tends to be
harder to notice at the higher frame
rates so certainly I would think that
yeah it's probably not worth that
hundred fifty dollars if you're game
playing on gaming in that sort of frame
rate range it really depends on your use
case though and sort of what your budget
is if you're just going out for the best
monitor you can get you have your money
to burn
sure spend extra hundred fifty dollars
on g-sync but from doing a lot of
testing on these models and using them
side-by-side I think it's quite hard to
tell when adaptive sync is enabled when
it's disabled at above sort of that 100
FPS range
did I see Linus's r-tx Titan yes I saw
it interesting I always thought there'd
be a Titan coming out but yeah
interesting that he leaked it what is my
favorite video game so I just finished
we're dead redemption - I played that
for 70 hours on ps4 this will be you
know I play my console games as well as
my PC game so I played on peer support
Pro I've realized that games for one of
my favorite games of all time it's
really really good if you have a console
playing it I really hope it comes to PC
so that because I know you guys don't
have consoles don't do console gaming I
really hope it comes to PC because it is
an amazing game witcher 3 as well as one
of my favorite games of all time
civilization 4 is probably up there as
well one of the GTA is probably GTA san
andreas will be up there so certainly
yeah those are some of the games I
really like playing and yes worth buy an
xbox one next well yeah sure my xbox one
extra Red Dead Redemption if you want
ps4 pros cheaper very so something to
consider
what is your expectation for na'vi do
you feel like it would give us 1080 like
performance for a reasonable price or is
it going to be another Vegas situation
so Vega would be something like giving
us 1080 performance for a reasonable
price I guess it didn't really launch at
a reasonable price but today you know
Vega 56 for example is quite reasonable
no I expect Navi to be quite a big
change the move to 7 anime is I
mentioned this earlier in the stream the
roof does 7 enemies will bring a lot of
things you know just from the technical
standpoint being able to clock higher
you know have more course on the same
size die I think as well there'll be a
big architecture change like I said I
think when you shrink nodes you tend to
get those big architectural improvements
so I think if you go with Navi moving 7
enemies there'll be a lot of change
there I would certainly be I think you
would I'd be shocked if it they didn't
have a highly compare of high end GPU
certainly that you know maybe they only
come up with a 20 atti on 7 enemies
that's still a massive jump for AMD and
would certainly make them competitive at
least for the short run depending on how
expensive they can make that cheap you
as well so yeah that's my expectations
I'd be very disappointed if they
couldn't at least match the 2080 eye or
even exceeded for those sort of flagship
tier prices so yeah that's what I'm
hoping and expecting from aim be there
was nothing huh what else we got lots of
question that scroll back a little bit
here you're probably missing it a fair
few people Navi will give us GTX steady
performance brought 200 to 300 dollars I
would hope so I mean the GT x 1080
itself is you know it's not quite at
those price to use but certainly getting
cheaper and cheaper what's in my bottle
this is just water this is boring
Qualcomm branded water not a sponsor or
you think we all really do anything with
Qualcomm it's got this water boyfriend
in one time yeah just water nothing
exciting
ah what I'll suffer here do I even game
yes to a lot of game I've been playing
at the moment I'll be playing Assassin's
Creed Odyssey I'm about 30 hours in
apart from the persistent stuttering
issues and general crappiness on PC it's
quite a fun game biking it apart from
those technical problems so yeah it's
been a bit of fun um what else we got
here certainly is getting late guys
11:30 p.m. not sure how long I was
thinking of doing it but whatever let us
know if you want us to do more live
streams in the future don't know what we
really be doing on live streams but
we're certainly interested in doing more
live streams I've quite greens in my
place so I can do them a lot of times do
you have an estimate of how many
kilowatts the system will consume over
the 48 hours uh yeah it's a good
question it's probably being that sort
of 20 kilowatt range certainly need to
have the streaming pc and the pc going
and the lighting and the display going
all at the same time is probably yeah
and that sort of it won't be one
kilowatt i wouldn't have thought it
would be interesting to get the meter
our wonderful it's one kilowatt but
certainly above 500 watts to run all of
this stuff I'd be thinking maybe six or
seven hundred watts for everything all
up it's only the GPU itself we'll be
using you know sort of around that 250
watt mark yeah and the CP which isn't a
700 K so yeah yeah it's probably using a
fair bit so yeah I'll be expecting to
use maybe 30 to 35 kilowatt hours of
power a lot of that will be offset by
solar yeah we have solar so during the
day you know I'll be running basically
fully off so it's not anything to worry
about but yeah lots of power lots of
power I'm more interested about the fact
that this video I'll be uploading like a
hundred and fifty gig to YouTube over
the next however much time are you in
Steve trying to get into the anthem
closed beta for next weekend
I'd be interesting to get in
what we're currently have at the moment
probably not yeah Tim will you review
Pacey cases in the future no probably
not
we're not neither Steve nor I are super
interested in PC cases we just don't
find them but particularly it's like a
lot of that stuff you know PC you know
keyboards and mice we find particularly
interesting you know things like fans
cooling I'm not particularly interesting
you know it's nice to know which which
of those things is the best we've
considered doing roundups for sure but
you know we're more interested in your
components like your CPU - motherboards
GPUs UV things like storage is something
that we're not super interested in
covering a lot on the channel also
because it does it doesn't get this
little interest that our other content
does so that's always a consideration
for us again game is Nexus does a really
good job with their case content so you
know we'd sort of have to you know we'd
be competing with them a little bit in
sort of doing that that content so yeah
it's probably not something that we're
interest and we're sort of more
interested in so continuing to focus on
our more into content because there's
not a lot of good information about
monitors we're having your test a lot
more as we sort of build up a database
of monitors and yeah so that's the sort
of things we're just playing on
specializing in and across testing CPUs
motherboards GPUs games and monitors our
schedule is pretty much full already so
if we tried to fit in like another
component into that you know there's not
a lot of time to do it so even if we had
more people on hand to test you know
it's only Steve and I doing this stuff
we don't have any other people working
hard from it boxed in terms of like
anything or anything it's just us we do
everything all the testing it's all us
even if we have more people to test
after we probably wouldn't be moving big
into that of this stuff so yeah we just
try and do stuff that we finds
interesting on the channel you know we
don't want to you know some of those
views that we count some of our videos
you know not as big as we would like or
not as big as we can some of our bigger
videos but we're just doing because we
like to eat and we like testing this
stuff we like making the content so we
just do it and that's probably a good
good way to do it
what else have we got here
why does P&amp;amp;Y have so little market share
compared to other companies yeah it's a
good question I mean I sort of always
grouped them in that same categories are
those smaller manufacturers you know you
got your soos MSI gigabytes or the big
tears bigger companies like EVGA have to
be in there for the our us audience as
well then I was big here but they're big
over there and you sort of put in like
your pian works you sort likey XFX and
your power covers and those sort of
companies so yeah I don't know it's just
that's the way it is you know there's
bigger companies there's small companies
with that thing you're gonna sit there
for 40 head house no I'm not I'm gonna
go to bed probably maybe like 20 minutes
or so I see probably at 20 minutes and
me being on the stream then we're going
to focus just on this for the rest of it
I was told that if you put an IPS panel
next to a TN panel you'll never want to
go T and ever again wonder how much
truth there really is to that yeah
there's a lot of truth to that and
that's mainly for the reason that with
TN panels the big disadvantage of them
is their viewing angles and it's to the
point where if you're not viewing it
like directly dead-on everything's
perfectly aligned your angles are good
then you get major amounts of color
shift so if you're slightly off-center
you can get big changes in how the
brightness how the colors are looking on
that panel you get good things like good
response times but also you know just
think you get issues with things with
tears like you know a lot of panels a
6-bit not 8-bit natively you get issues
with you know a lot of panels not
necessarily having good color quality in
terms of maybe not reaching 100% srgb as
IPS is more likely to do that contrasts
tend to be worse on TN and IPS there's
not a big difference between contrast 14
and IPS but yeah one of the sort of
things you get from light IPS is that
you sort of view it from slightly
different angles and you don't get that
massive color shift good quality tiens
are still good in terms of their color
reproduction there's certainly a fast
fit sheet a lot of the time but IPS
is that step up in a lot of regards I
still think of it yeah this panel here
is a VA panel that we're using for this
stream I think VA is probably the sort
of best mix and combination of things
but every type of monitor has its
problems
when you go to bed is this just going to
be a camera watching the screen until
someone wakes up and talks we probably
won't come back and talk at all during
the rest of the stream we'll have to
move on to doing other stuff that means
the weekend so you probably be doing too
much stuff tomorrow
but yes after I've after I leave the
stream it will just be focused on this
for the next 46 hours so I don't expect
any of you guys to stick around we're
just gonna keep it running you can come
back and check it from time to time see
how it's go and see whether it's died
don't expect it to die but yes it will
become very very boring after I leave
the stream so yeah that's pretty much
where it's at
ha what else is going on
what Ram frequency will you suspect sent
to achieve not sure we'd hope it to be
higher sin second-gen rise and still
fairly capable in terms of that but yeah
you never know
could you just move the monitor to the
left and show it's inside the case yeah
when I leave I'll be I'll reposition the
camera Britt so you can see the case
which is just off screen here and the
display a bit more and then we will
leave it at that pretty much no I'm not
gonna sleep in the chair come on guys
okay I know that something you know
it'll be this second time left to sleep
during this live stream that'll be when
all the stuff goes down probably who
knows what about a power outage have you
hooked up to a UPS no I don't have a UPS
but in the entire time I've been living
in the CBD of Melbourne or in the
general area of Melbourne I've never had
a power outage the only time we've ever
had a power outage was when it was
scheduled to do work but never have
power interruptions here and the power
delivery is really good even during the
summer just never have issues I guess we
might be lucky sometimes and the
Internet has I'm no chooser we've chosen
that ISP well so we don't have any
internet issues either so we don't
expect any of those things to go down
during the stream I'm not even try for
internet works if the power goes to
analytic the NBN box we've got he
requires power not sure we have to check
that do you think they 3,700 X will be
299 hundred K depends if they can get
the clock speed similar to the nine
hundred K for getting the call count
which I expect to be higher if they can
get the clock speeds right up there they
can improve the IP see if they can get
the latency is down if they can get
better memory support and if they can
introduce those things like you know
proper AVX support which seems like
they're doing then yeah I would expect
it to be yeah pretty powerful
when do you expect affordable 4k 75
Hertz panels to hit the market I've been
waiting for them for years um not sure
75 Hertz is going to be the next step
for 4k I think they'll just go full up
to 120 Hertz because it seems like that
the panel's that they're making at the
moment the ones that can do 4k 60 Hertz
can only do 60 Hertz and then the ones
that can do high refresh can do high
refresh the thing that we're sort of
seeing with the 75 Hertz modes for 1080p
and for 1440p is not speed but
definitely for 1080p that was mostly
them making 60 Hertz Morrow's that could
by chance also go up to 75 Hertz they
started to sort of been the monitors or
been the panels a bit again I guess so
they could get them up to 75 Hertz
because you know a lot of people find
that they could just get a 60s modern
overclock it so I think we're 75 Hertz
our 4k probably not going to be as big
and I think if there weren't going to be
high refresh powers which they're
starting to manufacture then they'll
just go to 120 Hertz fall out so like we
see what some 120 Hertz 4k TVs so yeah
blame them for years yeah don't expect
them to be big thing Liz Peck has
donated $5 thanks for the super chat
there is there a certain amount of time
before you should upgrade your modem /
router and do the more expensive ones
make a difference so we don't cover
monitors all that much on hardware I
mean so compromises modems and routers
on hardware unbox all that much but so I
guess the main question is when should
you upgrade so the the time you should
be thinking of upgrading is if there's a
router out there that has better
capabilities than your existing router
there's no point really you know I mean
this makes sense right you wouldn't
upgrade to a newer monitor or newer
router if it does pretty much exactly
the same thing your old one does but I
think it can't it comes down to sort of
the devices you have in your house as
well because there's no point buying a
router that has you know it has more
antennas that can do more my most dreams
it has more bands there's no point
paying for that functionality if your
Wi-Fi capable devices can't
harness those capabilities so for
example but if you were you know back in
the early days of attitudes 11ac and you
had an 802 211 n router there was a lot
of point upgrading from n to AC if you
didn't have any AC devices you were just
early adopting and you'd have to wait
until you get those AC devices and even
now even though AC is sort of been
widespread in the market there are still
a wide difference between devices that
you know can do multi-user mimo which is
one of the big you know sort of modern
features you get with the mid-range too
high and routers mu-mimo
and that sort of thing that I'd be
looking at if I was buying a I actually
recently upgraded my router I got a
whole bunch of stuff like my mo massive
your bandwidth capabilities and that
just you know determines how many
devices you can have connected at once
the more capabilities the more bandwidth
you have you know the more antennas you
have the my mode capabilities all
determines how many devices you can have
so I think if it's at the point where
you have a lot of devices they can
harness these new capabilities
if you've sort of moved to a bigger
house you need better range you know
modern routers can do far better ranges
and older routers they certainly are
improving that a lot that's sort of
where be thinking about upgrading your
router to and certainly as you add more
devices into your house for example you
know maybe five years ago you only had
two or three devices now you might have
10 or 15 devices connected to Wi-Fi
there could be that advantage especially
if you're streaming a lot of like videos
streaming or YouTube or something like
that there could be that advantage to
upgrading to get all those capabilities
again depends on what sort of devices
you have in your house another super
chat here as well thank you gackt una 64
I hope I'm pronouncing that right again
you ever consider doing this test
twinning AET I as a main card with Vegas
64 in beer five of the dx12 enabled um
yeah not sure does dx12 support that
level of multi-gpu in terms of cross
vendor multi-gpu because I know with
DirectX 12 it's all up to the
implementation of the developers as to
whether they you know how they sort of
use their multi-gpu so yeah it's
probably not something that would be
looking into all that much it would be
more of a sort of oh that's nice if it
works sort of thing but I think it'd be
interesting in the games that do have
you know that proper support for
multi-vendor multi-gpu which I'm not
sure about four or five does again I'll
have to look into it the interesting
thing is put in your AMD cards into a
system and then trying to get free sink
running through them that's one of the
things we covered on the channel a while
back haven't really looked back into
that to see if updating if that still
works because again for example run by a
Vegas 64 to do it you would buy like an
entry-level AMD GP that supports free
sync and it was possible back when I
tested that video in some situations not
all of them to have that you plug your
money into the AMD GPU and then
basically you tell Windows to run your
you know GPU intensive apps on your main
NVIDIA GPU and then you can basically
get both the benefit of free sync
through the AMD GPU and you actually
running on your faster NVIDIA GPU work
sometimes wasn't 100% perfect but it did
work sometimes which is pretty
interesting pretty interesting yes Steve
says kind of pointless Steve are you
still awake I thought you would have
gone to bed by now your old man don't
you always say that if you stay up too
late that you get you wake up too early
the next day or something and you know
sorts of problems with your yes stuff by
doing that sort of thing
who knows
when will DL SS be available it says
Adam very good question I don't know
we're constantly sort of checking with
developers checking within video to see
when these technologies are available is
why we sort of first on that with the
DXi in battlefield 5 sort of thing DSS
is available right now in the Final
Fantasy 15 benchmark publicly so if you
have an RTF card and you want to check
out do SS in that benchmark it's only in
the benchmark I don't think it'll ever
come to the game because there's sort of
finished development on it but it is
available in that game so that's kind of
it for now
I hope it comes to more themes because
we really want to we already did test it
in the benchmarks that were available it
wasn't that impressive but we would
really want to test it in real world
game implementations to sort of get to
the bottom of that further sort of look
into it further to see how it's going
yeah that's kind of where we're at for
do SS
Tim have you ever experienced having to
disable integrated graphics and device
manager to not freeze the system there's
a nice plane going to go you're headed
moment I have to go through five safe
most update my radio and drivers yes
sometimes it depends on the system
particularly the laptops you can get a
few issues with integrated graphics
messing things up which gets to serving
the integrated graphics can make a
difference
suddenly sure I run into all that much
but it can help sometimes
if you're asking a Steve to do a fishing
adventure video you'll have to check out
our patreon exclusive behind-the-scenes
videos Steve's been doing a lot of
videos exclusive for our patrons he's
building a shed at the moment so he's
currently being sort of giving progress
updates of him on this project is doing
entire thing himself to put a whole
bunch of steel and all the sort of stuff
to to build it with so yeah a few
interesting sort of things that we do
outside of the sort of benchmarking
stuff our patreon behind-the-scenes
videos have been that stuff and if Steve
goes fishing I'm sure that because he
bloody loves fishing that he'll love to
talk about that in a behind-the-scenes
video so we'll see what's happening
there but certainly if we do that
there'll be now patreon behind scenes
stuff
oh yes getting late here yes as Sal says
who is one of our patreon members in our
disco chat Steve posted yeah about like
40 pictures of him fishing in the
discord doing fun stuff there so yeah
and yet you do get access to a discord
chat if you're a picture of memory don't
hang out with us as well but we talk
about that pretty much everybody here so
even her to say that by now then yeah
okay
Gordon and Steve have both recent links
discussed there Nass tries failing have
you had any experience with this if so
where else do you back up - yeah it's
interesting I watched Steve's video
about the NASA nology NASA's fairing
that's disappointing our notes our Steve
Howey unbox Steve has used sonority
stuff a little bit personally I just
have all my drives in my a few systems
so something like I've got like a
storage server sort of that has a bunch
of stuff on that I've some files on it
but then my main system it has 16
terabytes of drives in it itself so I
just basically just use that and I
haven't really reached the point where
that 16 terabytes has been fully
utilized so I'd probably be looking at
personally I wouldn't be looking at an a
so be more looking at building a full-on
storage PC Steve says he hasn't any
issues with Synology so if fingers
crossed there but yeah dunk v2 has sent
over 2 pounds through super check can
you show something from the chef behind
you yeah sure what do you want to see
from the shop I'll happily get something
off the shelf but you'll have to tell me
what you want to see so have a look at
overviews got some Lego stuff the boxes
are very boring they're just random
random boxes of stuff but if you have
something you want to see dunk v2 let me
know in the chat I'll get off we can
have a look the wd-40 come on guys you
don't want to see the wd-40 it is up
there though it's up there somewhere
putting on this stuff's hard
and hopefully Duncan VA gets back to us
so we can show you whatever he wants to
see in the shop ah
he says BBA all right let's get bb-8
down maybe I'll grab the TIE fighter
you'll see that okay so here is the Lego
bb-8
so it's got the sort of spring-loaded
head on it it doesn't really roll
obviously Lego would roll quite poorly
but yes its head moves it's got various
different things in it like it's got the
little flame that comes out here so
let's go real you can sort of rotate
that into and there's you can rotate the
head here using this other one on this
side and then on the back there is
nothing so it's messy you just got those
few features there you sort of build in
and yeah so that's the Lego bb-8 there
that you wanted to see these aren't
actually that well it's Lego is always
expensive but these aren't that
expensive so that is the bb-8 that dunk
v2 wanted to see they're so fun stuff it
if you guys want to see the Ty fire as
well
Steve says oh no Tim is playing with his
Legos this dream is gonna go away yeah
will go away now so it's hi fire
so the tie fires I could see a lot
bigger it's much heavier so this one I
think you can open it up and in the top
there is a little seat in there I think
that's pretty much all the features it
has that particular one so nothing too
exciting there that is the ultimate
collector series TIE fighter it comes
with the stand which you can maybe see
in the background wd-40 it is actually
real legitimate wd-40
I'm not smashing anything Steve come off
it so this is your standard wd-40 can
it's got the nice little nozzle just in
case you want to spray things closer
this is legit wd-40 know that fake OH
stuff with legit wd-40 came from
Bunnings Warehouse would you believe it
our local hardware store - 75 grand can
so your standard stuff and if I was
going to review wd-40 I would certainly
give it at least an 8 out of 10 I think
it's quite a good lubricant product and
the particular can with its adjustable
nozzle you know that's got to give it at
some point so maybe 9 out of 10 with the
nozzle versatile does a lot of things
and yeah penetrates lubes things good
stuff what am I watching here okay I've
got another super chat show you the big
digger and make some noises of a digging
please the dig is probably the heaviest
thing that's on the channel in the
background
but you guys want it so I'll bring it
okay this this is the Chuck going out of
hand wanted to see the Lego stuff well
fair enough
you guys don't even see the background
from time to time so this is the
bucket-wheel excavator one of the
largest LEGO Technic sets it's
battery-powered so there's some switches
and stuff up here that we can turn on we
can make this stuff and you can have
some fun noises coming through because
this thing's not pretty loud
yes that's the bucket-wheel excavator
it's got other features as well I can
rotate the disc and rotate and it can
drive forwards as well using the various
different toggles up here and but yeah
so thank you to Eric Chong who wanted to
see the bucket-wheel excavator and make
some noises of her digging so this is it
this took ages to build to ages its
scooping power is quite bad though
because you can just stop it with your
finger pretty much pretty easily and
yeah probably does need some wd-40 but
we stopped that because it's very
annoying noise
all right style asks what's the
backplate tempat okay let's give that a
look absolutely didn't put my
thermocouple round this side sorry back
plate temps come yet seventy two point
five degrees Celsius we also have 54
degrees exhaust and 36 degrees case
ambient and 24 degrees 24 degrees in the
room at the moment I am just gonna get
to do a quick break and come back
because why not I'm having fun I don't
need to go to be anytime soon so I'll be
back in a couple minutes
all right no need to worry guys that
didn't go to bed all right
what's been happening fishing bikes I
guess maybe I was away Marian see it has
given us a super chat here my ITEX 20 80
blue screens in arc when I fly in online
service but is fine on single-player
there seems to be a very common problem
fight X is any comment I yeah honestly I
haven't heard about this problem before
but that certainly is pretty unusual to
have it blue screen in particular with
that particular card in that specific
setting hmm Briony I would imagine that
that's just a driver problem so you
hopefully get enough you know support
from it video you know make a bit of
noise and you might fix that one but
yeah I meant that's a driver issue
something that it does in the online
segment is different from the single
plane it's just screwing up somehow
that's a very unusual problem yeah
certainly haven't heard about that one
Daru dissents don't come on we don't
drink VB I know we're from Victoria but
we're not we don't drink for you be
seriously what Internet service provider
are you with Aussie broadband in case
you're wondering they have very good
reliability and speeds no problems had
no problems within this entire time so
yeah that's pretty much it wouldn't be
funny if I was still my top tree on my
break yeah that would have been funny
but I'm not wearing a lapel mic so no
chances for that that happening
greetings from Malaysia what are the
best places to visit in Australia um
yeah visiting an Australian down here in
Melbourne unless you're really like so
your food and restaurants cafes that
sort of thing probably not a whole lot
to see down here I'd be definitely going
to either you know the desert in the
centre so going to see like Leroux and
that sort of area in the Northern
Territory also the Great Barrier Reef is
spectacular I've got somewhere like Port
Douglas head there go out see the go out
see the reef and yes Sydney as well if
you like seeing things like the Opera
House the harbour briefed I've got a
really good zoo there as well so if you
want to see like the Australian animals
you don't actually see them out in the
outback go there
that's probably my recommendations there
and I'm just know I'm going to knock
that down maybe I'll leave this here
just in case
crabby gamer has sent us some rupees
thank you for that scar two or Zephyrus
m10 70 so that's laptop question talking
about the asou rog versions of those
laptops the scars good like it's good
but it's more of a mid-range laptop this
is efforts being a higher-end laptop I
think personally find buying a gaming
laptop I really want it to be portable
so I've got the zephyrus and from that
perspective simply because it actually
is a very portable system and the good
thing about both those systems if the
Scotch with is represent is both of them
come with a fully fledged gtx 1070
not the max-q variant the old zephyrus
had up to a 1080 max cube I believe the
new Zephyrus M version has that actual
full 1070 in it rather than going for
the 1080 max cute so yes that that would
be my choice obviously it's much more
expensive to get the Zephyrus that's
something you have to keep in mind but I
love the portability
as any of hardware box life has changed
or adapted to your life since joining um
that's an interesting question has my
life change I mean I was never really a
super talkative person and not super
comfortable get in front of a camera so
I think I've gotten a lot better at that
since joining certainly been hopefully
working on that a little bit um yeah I
mean my schedule I'll guess is just sort
of similar to how always has been I
think because I was doing this for
textbook before now there wasn't a lot
of change in sort of you know there's
always been times where we really need
to get things out on time so there'd be
a lot of crunching and working you know
late hours into the night and getting up
early to finish it off the next day we
did that with that RTX video in
battlefield 5 we did a lot of work on
that didn't get much sleep to get that
one out so I mean that sort of stuff was
sort of happening before the hardware
unboxed I just think the main way is
like just we have a lot we were getting
a lot more stuff now that we were doing
harbor and box like a lot more
hardware's been coming in so a lot more
times needed to be focused on it sort of
organizing all the stuff we have and
that's all things that's probably where
that where that comes from what do you
think is the best GPU to get for 1440p
144 Hertz now the 1080i is out of stock
he's the 2088 good middle ground just
grew up to the 2002 I um the 20 hei is
probably overkill for 1440p 144 Hertz
that's really for your 4k gaming 2080
would be very good for 1440p 144 Hertz
so yeah go 28 for that one I reckon
ah the asparagus juice the asparagus
juice so that is so for those of you who
weren't around for megamix which
happened to Computex 2018 we do stream
we've got some Asian drinks we mix them
all together at the end which is a bad
idea but we had this thing here
asparagus juice green asparagus juice
this is the most disgusting drink I've
ever tasted in fact just the worst
tasting thing ever it's awful
it kinda tastes like asparagus but in a
bad way like a smooth asparagus is fine
but this is like asparagus sitting in
water and just sort of stewing and it's
got like a very like type descry like a
sort of weak vegetable water like almost
as if you'd boiled vegetables and then
drank the water that's what this tastes
like in a bat in a really bad way so I
don't know why you would drink this it's
just it's it's beyond me but it's it's
off it truly is terrible and now forever
lives in on the Shelf have I tried a
Geryon yes I've tried a juried I thought
it was pretty bad I think not it wasn't
as you know some people say that ruins
smell really bad and taste good I just
thought it tasted like a weed sort of
onion just yeah wasn't yeah
really worse it wasn't really that bad
but it wasn't bad it wasn't good either
so yeah not good
funnily enough there's a guy that lives
around here that drives a durian truck
so there's durians or something I'm
using the jury in business I don't know
and is this still live here its life but
that person asked is it live yep it's
still live probably gone for a bit
longer than I thought I would go to and
yeah it is it's the 2nd of December now
it is past midnight and nothing
interesting has happened in the stream
that I was expecting anything
interesting happen at this point
so will you let your stream go for 48
hours yes I'm gonna get off the stream
go to bed and just leave it running for
the next two days yep certainly
interesting stuff so I'm guessing that
the card with the clock speeds which I
believe let me look 1635 megahertz yeah
it's probably just hearing that sort of
thermal limit because it is running at
86 degrees on the core 74 degrees on the
back plays well last time I checked so
yep so yes stop clocks
that's out runs it's stopped you can
certainly get out much higher with
overclocking and working a bit more on
their thermals can I tell me you guys
know about my personal main gaming
system so it's basically the system you
would have seen in the thread Ripper
2950 X build so it's got a thread Ripper
2950 X I have an overclocked or anything
is just writing stock at the moment but
he hits about the sort of four gigahertz
mark quite reasonably it depends on the
workload but that's a good sort of
amount that it gets to it's on the msi
meg x3 no no creation motherboard so one
of those really top and actually 99
boards has been great I love that board
I'm running and a gigabyte RT X xx atti
in my main system so that's been good
for gaming I use an ultra wide monitor
3440 by 1440 100 Hertz and that checks
between ati and ultra sayings does get
you up around the 100 FPS mark in all
the games so it's good for that it's got
32 gigabytes of course their vengeance
LED memory ddr4 3000 I'll be upgrading
that 64 gig at some point there's just
pew SSDs few hard drives in there it's
in the coarser Obsidian 500 day I've got
a Corsair I forgot the box so here yeah
I got the 150 I Pro in there I've got an
RM
850 X in there as well so that's mine
that's my main system use it for video
editing use it for gaming use it for
everything
if it did die how would you know it was
the Cardinal a power supply issue well
if it was a power supply we could just
swap out the power supply if it's the
card we could swap into another system
and if it still doesn't work then it's
dead
pretty much what else is happening
how badly do you really need heat
singsong ddr4 probably not that required
but yeah probably improves things a
little bit but RAM temperatures never
really a big issue especially if you
have you even some form of airflow in
the system this is sort of massive
you're overclocking and running at those
really high speeds and you might need to
think about it but really it's not
really a huge point of it
any idea what's delaying the susi g32
shown at Computex
ah Nick you asked us a lot about the CG
32 because I think very interested in it
still no word and the main thing about
that is that a soos is well known to
release monitors to announce monitors so
far ahead of when they're actually
released
someone is like a year later you might
be lucky to get them released like 18
months so yeah if there's no word
there's no word unfortunately have I
just been answering questions for last
two hours
oh yeah pretty much pretty much it's
been fun though we've showing off some
stuff from the set that you guys wanted
to see surfs like the BBA showing off
the TIE fighter the bucket-wheel
excavator all that sort of thing so yeah
your thoughts on pulling SSD prices and
guess terminal when spinning Ruster
we're a place for home media storage yes
nice 10 SSD prices come down but hard
drive prices also come down so I Drive
like an 8 terabyte drive is really
affordable now you get your 10 12
terabytes or on the market as well so I
don't think they will ever really
replace that sort of you know tier they
could be a point where you simply can't
get enough storage inside an actual hard
drive which would then make them less
attractive than a solid state drive
which could potentially be have higher
density but I don't think that will ever
get to a point where SSDs is that sort
of like prices that are currently you'd
say for a hard drive they'll certainly
get a lot cheaper but not that level so
yeah it's certainly at a point where SSD
is very affordable but yeah I wouldn't
see that happening and certainly I think
yeah you're there's always gonna be that
trade-off of hard drives of slow but are
going to be big SSD is gonna be fast but
smaller or they might just be fast the
same capacity but more expensive that's
just that sort of thing
are we likely to see a large-scale shift
of ddr5 to 2019 very unlikely it still
seems a while away if a Star Wars item
was being bought for you this Christmas
what would you like it to be I don't
know I don't know your own most their
star was legal I want to own so maybe
not that are you XR on my T no I went to
the University of Melbourne so maybe
there's a rivalry there I don't know it
never really did much that stuff when I
was at uni crucial nx500 or Samsung at
60 evo the 860 evo is faster than the MX
500 so that could be reason to get it
but I think if you're getting in that if
you're in that sort of cited tier of SS
days you should just get like a really
dirty ape Drive so like the 860 q vu the
new Samsung Drive is very very
affordable the MX 500 very affordable so
that's sort of what I think think if you
want that sort of if you look up an SSD
for performance you should be going like
m2m not to nvme drives PCIe that sort of
thing
please say something about Intel GPUs
before I hit the hay yeah it's hard to
know until it's going to do it their
GPUs I'd be surprised if they were at
the performance level that in video I am
Dee were at at the time that they come
out so if it is then come out 2020 I'd
be surprised if they were as powerful as
Amy or nvidia gpus at that time where
there be affordable obviously they have
to have some advantage so where that's
price to performance or something
they'll be interesting I certainly think
they will be designed primarily for
compute so they'll be heavily focused on
you know your double precision compute
your also your things like into a in for
deep learning that sort of thing so I
would imagine that the GP would be very
heavily designed towards that so you
interesting to see what the the bounce
will be between sort of traditional
shader cause and the cause that are
designed for those you know other types
of processing
yeah interesting stuff
why don't arm processes enter the
desktop space arm processes are slow
they're coming into the laptops at the
moment but they don't scale particularly
well up to the sort of high waters that
you see with Intel CPUs and Intel CPUs
and AMD as well but on x86 have a lot of
instructions that arm processes can't
execute so because they're just not
built to handle that those sort of
pipelines so that's kind of the reason
why you don't see arm fully in the
desktop space there be a lot of
compatibility issues as well with but
your applications built for x86 not
working on arm good for specialized
tasks like data centers that can
specialize and use instructions you
things like your tablets and phones that
are built on arm so let me know makes a
lot of sense they're sort of
acceleration with ARM processors as well
what's the time there it's currently
nearly 12:30 a.m. here in Australia so
yeah fun stuff
how long until internally is 10 animated
desktop CPUs hopefully next year but
will sort of wait and see what the level
of 10 nanometer we get whether it's sort
of like a cut-down crappy 10 nanometer
or whatever so yeah interesting and hey
Brian I see that techy our city has
joined us for a bit of our fun times
here so yeah it's probably getting
towards the end of the bit where our be
on the stream the stream will continue
to run for a long time after this can we
cook an egg on the back plate in the
morning probably let's take a look at
the temperature so we're currently 73
degrees on the back plate so it's
probably could be used for eggs if
you've got some sort of device you could
cook the egg on there yeah possibly it's
a big metal slab in there too
yeah you might want to towel it up or at
least put something on there to sort of
prevent the egg from slipping out
everywhere so yeah that's kind of what
be happening there
what else we got here
the best GPU for 1440p ultra gaming
probably like a 1070 TI or a Vega 56 at
the moment going on pricing very good
value for money there what else we got
here
yeah
what's your preference of drink wine
spirits beer or a cheeky premix I prefer
beer out of though of that selection not
a huge fan of wine or pre-mixed drinks I
think they're mostly terrible spirits
yeah I can go a good spirit like a good
whisky that sort of thing
like a good whisky but yeah joints like
Bo sighs one would normally drink on
sort of like a hot night like to that
and yes I'll I do reckon that the 2080
GI issue is some sort of manufacturing
issue I think it's probably some batch
of components that they used
maybe it's the memory maybe some other
component that was there used on the
boards used on the validation piece of a
design is faulty in some way and they
just shipped out cars it was missed in
the QA testing somehow you know I just
think that is the situation there single
malt or blended of course single malt
blended stuff is pretty rubbish got it
good if you're mixing it with like coke
or something but if you're gonna drink
it straight you definitely to get a
single malt
what did i study at university so i have
a master's degree in electrical
engineering so that's what I studied it
was fun it was interesting stuff good to
get some info on sort of how how stuff's
designed did some PCB staff all that
sort of things so yeah I've done stuff
like PCB design done designs of filters
that sort thing there's a lot of what
Electrical Engineering was sort of
focused on a lot of maths sort of
figuring out those sort of things and
yeah books a few things it was fun it
was interesting and now I'm doing this
so fun stuff and yes sadly a lot of good
and electrical engineering degree does
we were just making YouTube videos yeah
I know I could have got a job doing
engineering I guess but I think this is
a much better life to have much more fun
I get to work from home which is great
someone asked scotch or Japanese um I
like both I sent to find all other
Japanese stuff to be better from just
from the stuff I've justice or similar
price categories just prefer some of the
taste of the Japanese stuff but scotch
is good too depends what he's there and
don't ask me to remember any names of
any whiskey because I've no idea don't
remember anything
what was my final year project so we did
a really interesting file your project
we built a communication system that
communicated over alcohol molecules we
built the system that basically would
physically spray alcohol across a room
we developed a coding system fairly
unique and interesting coding system it
was different to different to how modern
like Internet coding actually works so
you do a lot of stuff on that so our
project is log focus a big focus on that
suicide the communication side of
Electrical Engineering so yeah it's
really slow but we did some interesting
things there with have how to get a
sensor response to work well how I could
sort of deal with errors and that sort
of thing
so yeah that's what we do and we could
send hello world in like a few maybe
like a minute it's pretty slow
am I going to see yes Brian probably not
probably not not super interesting gonna
say yes I think we'll probably escape a
tad at Computex some of you don't have
plans to go see yes so if there's
anything happening or recovering from
here I would build a the similar system
that we were using with a wd-40 but may
be difficult to find a sensor that would
detect wd-40 there's probably an oil
sensor actually but would just depend
what sort of response is like the
alcohol sisters will quite fast and
didn't require a lot of alcohol to
detect so that made them really good for
sort of the application were using it
for but yeah every written a book would
I have no I'd never I've never consider
writing a book that'll be a lot of work
so yeah that wouldn't happen
alright alright
a very Australian final project anything
to work with booze yeah yeah it did work
with booze we did most of the tests with
methylated spirits but yeah work with
booze for sure fun stuff
have I been here for two hours
yes I'll be seen here for two and a half
hours now pretty much except for that
one time I took a break for like a
minute
but yeah it's like 12:30 a.m. so I
should probably get off the stream soon
and go to bed I'm not gonna spray the
wd-40 in here guys seriously
ah interesting stuff what are my
opinions on the architects tighten that
lino showed off you mentioned that a few
times in the stream already but
basically not surprised they're coming
out with 90 XTi and interesting that
Linus linked it in that way but whatever
see the fun stuff fun stuff
luckily it's still working don't want my
twin hei to die that would be bad so I
guess I'll probably wrap it up in a
moment so if you have any final
questions probably getting them in now
and I answer a few more before we get
going and yeah
yeah no Brian no no wd-40 spraying what
time is in Australia it is 12:30 3:00
a.m.
as we heard about the 12-hour issue with
YouTube I have to look into that in the
morning to see what the situation is
there if they only save the last 12
hours yeah I get worthy really interest
in saving the part if it dies we're only
interested in saving the part when it
dies and I don't think there'll be any
situation where would be a wave from
looking at it for 12 hours so yeah that
certainly is the sort of thing that
would happen if it the last 12 hours of
the stream should have the part where it
dies in it because if it dies we're
going to keep your stream right for 48
hours or just stop and have a look at it
and going that sort of thing and
probably you know do some testing on the
live stream to see what's going on there
but yes that's pretty much it only says
last 12 hours that's that's it
love mechanical keyboards
okay yeah 12-hour timer for the archived
broadcasts so she'll be able to go for
the full 48 hours anyone who's joined
should be able to go back and watch the
start probably an interesting bit but
yeah the archive might be yet destroyed
for whatever reason but that's fine
whatever okay
mmm ITT games MIT games
I sent through $2 thanks for that on the
super chat thoughts in the ASA 32 inch
4k 60fps juicing display I assume you
mean the new one that's coming out yeah
I think that's looking good not sure the
ACR capabilities will be liked but
certainly to get those monitors like
that yeah it should be good to get some
new 4k options that are a bit different
have a bit bit more HDR capabilities in
them and yeah so yeah looking forward to
seeing those I think acer mentioned
they're beginning at least one of those
out sometime in December is when they
said that they'd be ready for sampling
so that's hopefully when I'm yeah
looking into that and if you're not
talking about the new ones you're just
talking about some of the existing ones
most g-sync motors are pretty good
they're validated quite well
how many people work with Auburn box
it's just Steve and I we do everything
all the testing all the benchmarking all
the video editing everything's done by
just either of us dunk v2 asks on super
chair thanks to that what is hotter GTX
480 or RT x20 atti that's a good
question the tweeter TI gets pretty hot
but GZ explained you could practically
cook meat on that thing but again a lot
of Nvidia's stock cooler designs have
been pretty met for a while pretty hot
so certainly I don't think probably
overall though the GTX 480 for what it
was delivering was certainly a very hot
product probably the hottest ever
thanks Brian for the congratulations on
300k subs I haven't celebrated too much
but I probably do something with Steve
comes back over here to do some curios
and all that sort of thing but yeah so
nice to pass 300k good good to get some
support from you guys out there and yeah
thanks for the support for the years
there have been benchmarking this
okay yeah it's probably time to go off
the stream I reckon yeah I might
actually what I might do is stop the
stream for the first part so that we can
just save this sort of Q&amp;amp;A discussion
bit in the start of the video and then
I'll start up a second stream shortly
they'll pretty much following straight
on from this that will cover the rest of
the stream which will just be the boring
view of this for the next forty six
forty five and a half hours so yes
pretty much what I'm going to do in a
couple of minutes if you have any final
questions get those in so yeah that
would just allow people to watch the
interesting part of the stream and then
we'll keep the stream going without any
interesting bits for the rest of it is
it a heaven benchmark for 48 hours if so
what made you choose that benchmark it's
based on the hard OCP thing which was
their card they tested that in heaven
for eight hours then it died so that's
pretty much what we were we just want to
emulate the same thing there's plenty of
stuff you can loop but it's a very easy
benchmark to loop and yeah that's pretty
much the reason for that and yeah fun
times do not move the wd-40 says MIT
games no that will still be there be
able to enjoy that might be a little bit
out of frame I might have to you know
put that more like this so you guys see
it for the next part but we'll leave it
there we'll leave it there
okay how much money electricity with
this dream cost is interesting estimated
before that we'll probably use somewhere
in the 30 to 35 kilowatt hour mark which
isn't too bad on current electricity
prices but half of that will be salt
will be fully done by solar during the
day hours so they'll cut that but pretty
significant and they'll cut all of the
daytime running out of it so maybe then
we're looking at - yeah I don't know
maybe be looking at like 20 K 20 kill
what else who knows
which will cost like 10 bucks maybe now
it's it sounds a bit higher it's like 50
cents a kilowatt hour now be less than
that but to the ground yeah with the
bonus of the ground that would be
interesting for the stream that's for
sure
alright that's gonna do it for this
stream guys thanks for tuning in to the
hardware on boxed 24-hour or 48-hour I
should say I'm getting tired that's what
you get for 12:40 a.m. thanks for tuning
in to the RT x 2080 i 48-hour livestream
I'm gonna stop this stream setup part 2
of the stream in a couple of minutes
just so that we can archive the first
part because someone alerted us to the
fact that if we go for 48 hours alone
they keep the last 12 hours of streaming
so we want to keep this interesting part
the start for anyone to watch and then
the boring part well that's just the
boring part doesn't really know if
that's kept for the full 48 hours so I'm
sure you guys will be keen as mustard to
watch part 2 and to see all that stuff
just the boring screen for the next 46
hours you can tune in whenever you want
to check back from time to time to see
if anything's happened I probably won't
be on that stream to talk to you guys at
any point I'll probably just be coming
in to monitor things from time to time
probably won't be any more discussion of
all got all the discussion out in this
part so yeah that's the situation thanks
everyone for watching and stay tuned for
the fun part - and catch you next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
