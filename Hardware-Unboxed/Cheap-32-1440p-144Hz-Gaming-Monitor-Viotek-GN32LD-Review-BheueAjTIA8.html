looking at a monitor from a brand I've
never used before but one that a lot of
you guys have been requesting biotech
they're super popular on Amazon and make
some of the cheapest gaming monitors you
can get so I've always been interested
to see how they stack up and whether
it's worth buying this sort of monitor
over a more name-brand option the
monitor I have to review today is the
biotech G n 32 LD finally a relatively
simple name for a monitor this freesync
display tis 31.5 inches in size and
packs a curved 1440p va LCD the tops out
at a 144 Hertz refresh rate it's priced
at four hundred and seventy dollars
through Amazon which is around the mark
of some other budget brands like pic Co
and MSI but have monitors based on the
same panel but it's a lot cheaper than
say the a soos ROG Strix x3 32 vq or the
samsung c 32 HD 70 for example when
testing out more budget oriented
monitors are always wary of a couple of
things is the build quality any good and
is the display defective in any way to
address that second point first my
retail monitor ship with no issues
whatsoever so no dead pixels or anything
like that and in fact vo-tech actually
offers a full replacement if your
monitor arrives with the dead pixel so
it's really not something to be
concerned about as for build quality the
GN 32 LD is fine it's not particularly
amazing and I certainly wouldn't class
it as a high-end construction but it's
fine for a gaming monitor the base of
the three prong stand is metal but
otherwise the stands pillar and the rest
of the monitor use a greyish plastic
with a few red highlights the plastic
used on the pillar feels particularly
cheap as it uses a really basic finish
though it's a bit better on the rear of
the display itself overall vo-tech is
using a gamer design here which I tend
not to prefer there's a lot of strange
angles and vents that probably could
have done with that there's also two RGB
LED strips on the rear which add nothing
to the decide I mean you're not even
able to see them during standard
operation in there RGB support is basic
plus the RGB actually clashes with the
red highlights so overall it's a bit of
a strange choice the stand is sturdy and
does support both height and tilt
adjustment although
height adjust is quite limited there's
no swivel support not that swiveling is
that important and there's also no cable
management hole which again not that
important and a bit of a nitpick my
biggest issue with the design is the OSD
controls biotech has gone with four
buttons along the bottom edge of the
panel which makes navigating through the
OSD a pain compared to a directional
toggle all monitors really should be
using a directional toggle with menus of
this complexity
no exceptions however the OSD itself
includes a lot of features you'd also
find on monitors from other brands so
you're not missing out on much going
with the cheaper biotech option the OSD
includes things like a low blue light
mode crosshairs for cheating a super
resolution feature and even
picture-in-picture along with the usual
image controls the array of inputs on
the g and 32 LD is basic DVI HDMI and
DisplayPort plus an audio output jack
the monitor supports free sync with low
framerate compensation so you get
adaptive sync across the entire refresh
range up to 144 Hertz and I still think
the combination of resolution and
refresh rate the GM 32 LD provides it's
a 2560 by 1440 monitor after all is
perfect for gamers with reasonably high
in hardware gives that great mix of
smoothness and Clarry the Samsung VA
panel used here is curved with an 1800
hour curvature I'm or a flat panel kind
of guy with 16:9 monitors but at 32
inches in size the curve isn't that bad
plus right now there aren't many options
for monitors of this size and specs that
aren't curved so you're pretty much
stuck with it anyway let's talk a bit
more about the panel and see how our
test data matches up to via text claims
for brightness they lose 218 tips of
typical brightness and I measured a peak
of 365 nits which is going to be too
bright for most desktop users the
contrast ratio does fall a little
shorter biotechs claims though at a
touch under 2500 to one compared to its
rated 3000 to one value although as this
is a VA panel we're still getting that
nice high contrast ratio is also good to
see this contrast ratio held throughout
the brightness range new to our test
suite is response time testing one of
the most heavily requested metrics we've
bought some of the fastest tools
available to test response time and got
about testing some of these monos we've
had on hand and over time as we do more
monitor reviews we will get our largest
set of data forms
sweet comparisons but the good news is
we can now provide this key metric that
tells us a lot about how the model
affairs in smearing ghosting and how
suitable it is for gaming so vaio tech
they claim a three millisecond greater
gray response time using overdrive but
in my testing using the high response
time setting and that's the highest
setting available and the optimal
setting for this modeler I recorded just
an 8.2 millisecond greater great average
response which is quite slow but within
a normal range for VA panels as we know
VA is one of the slower LCD technologies
and that's on show in this result it
might also be useful to know that on
average rise times were significantly
longer than fall times almost double
across our test points and mid gray
transitions for example 20% white to 80%
white a particularly sluggish I also
recorded a 15 point one millisecond
black to white to black transition time
which shows you the time required to
make the largest luminance transition in
case you're wondering the important
thing to note here is that both the
average gray degrade response and rise
times in general actually took longer
than the refresh window this is a 144
Hertz monitor so the frame is updated
every six point nine four milliseconds
except this panel only is able to
transition in on average 8.2
milliseconds this means that in some
cases you might not be getting a true
144 Hertz refresh because the crystals
themselves simply can't transition fast
enough to show a completely new image at
that rate while you don't get any
noticeable overshoot smearing and
ghosting are concerns due to the long
response time however this isn't an
issue specifically with this vo-tech
monitor rather all monitors that use the
same Samsung VA panel will have roughly
their same response times equal to what
I've shown here so don't think that
you're getting a faster display if you
buy the MSI or a seuss monitors instead
they still use the same panel so they're
faced with the same inherent limitations
of the VA technology as we've i/o takes
three millisecond response time claimed
not exactly accurate to say the least
the good news is the GM 32 LD exhibits
excellent input lag of just a few
milliseconds so while transitions aren't
especially fast the monitor processes
its inputs quickly and gets on with the
job and yes we also have the ability to
test input lag now as well which we've
normally
the tools were using to give an estimate
of the displays processing time and
unlike some lag testing tools out there
our custom solution works at the
displays native resolution and refresh
rate before I get into color testing
let's look at uniformity after all this
is a curve display where uniformity is
often an issue while results here aren't
amazing and most flat panels will
produce a noticeably more even image the
GN 32l D is on par with other curve
displays in this metric the edges of the
display are inaccurate relative to the
center giving a slight vignette style
appearance but I'm yet to use a curve
monitor where this isn't an issue
testing the monitors straight out of the
box it's quite clear that vo-tech has
spent very little time calibrating the
display to any sort of color standard
Delta e values across our standard color
accuracy tests exceed 4.0 from the
factory and the color temperature is a
surprisingly warm 5890 4k on average
below what is required on top of that
the 2.2 gamma mode the panel is set to
by default does not produce 2.2 gamma
but 2.0 gamma and colors in general are
left unchecked so the monitor is more
saturated than it should be while
displaying srgb imagery the good news is
the monitor is quite calibrated if
that's a word and you can make several
key Corrections just through the
on-screen display using these settings
here I was able to correct the gamma
issue bizarrely the gamma 2.4 setting
gives a correct 2.2 value and tighten up
the color temperature which improves the
grayscale delta-e average to below 2.0
one of the better results i've seen just
by adjusting OSD settings saturation and
color checker results improve as well
like with most monitors you're not going
to get the best results unless you
perform a full calibration the good news
is a fully calibrated G + 32 LD is very
accurate with Delta YZ below 1.0
indicating the monitor is well suited to
color accurate work achieving this level
of calibration only resulted in a small
hit - brightness and contrast ratio and
this VA panel has a lot of headroom in
those departments of course I don't
think many professionals would want to
use a curved display for content
creation and the uniformity issues
prevent the panel from being superb in
terms of color accuracy but if you want
your gian 32 LD to be accurate it is
only a short calibration run away and
for those of you who are supporters of
hardware and box through our patreon
page
you can download the calibrated display
profile created for the vo-tech Jian 32
LD over on our page links to that in the
description below while not every
monitor is created equally at the
factory if you use my OSD settings in
conjunction with my profile you should
be able to get near the results I've
shown here without any specialized tools
so going into this review I was mostly
interested to see whether the vo-tech G
+ 32 LD could deliver the same sort of
experience and performance as more
popular monitor brands for less money
and I think in general the answer is a
resounding yes
that probably shouldn't come as a
surprise considering the GN 32 LD uses
the same panels other monitors with the
same specifications but it's good to
know that this doesn't appear to be a
low-quality binning of the panel or
anything like that it's defect free and
it performs exactly as I expected for
this panel type so if you were thinking
about buying an equivalent monitor from
a sous Borna save a decent amount of
cash the GaN 32 LD is a great option
that said there are some areas where
vo-tech has cut costs to keep the price
down the build quality is fine but it's
basic and in some areas pretty cheap the
panel can be calibrated to a good level
of accuracy but no real effort has been
made to tighten up color performance at
the factory and for a product that you'd
hope to last many years our one-year
warranty is shorter than some other OEMs
provide however all that considered I'd
still recommend the biotech G + 32 LD
and it's $470 asking price depending on
the retailer that's around the cheapest
you'll pay for a monitor with these
specs give or take a few dollars and
when you're getting a viewing experience
as good as a more expensive brand I
don't see a lot of point opting for a
price here equivalent I'd also suggest
you look at the vo-tech G + 32 Q as well
which uses the same panel and is even
cheaper although it does use a rather
unique gold design which might be
off-putting for some bias but I expect
that monitor to perform pretty much
exactly the same as the June 32 LD and I
think it might be getting phased out for
the newer model that's it for this first
review of a vo-tech monitor hopefully
the guys of biotech will send out a few
more monitors in the future because I
know how much do you guys love cheap
monitors consider supporting us on
