missed it last week i suggest going back
and checking the in depth benchmark
video that we put up which compared all
the current generation GPUs in a good
list of games I think it was about 16
games in total which were 2016 releases
and yeah like I said we compared all the
current generation GPUs but in that
video I didn't go into too much depth at
the end of sorta to say which GPU I
picked to be the winner at each sort of
price category and as a result quite a
few of you asked me to create a shorter
video so that is the video that is in 20
minutes long and just give my personal
sort of opinions and picks at each price
category as to which GPU is the best so
that's what we're doing today so let's
get on with it
right now is actually a really good time
to make some picks and not just because
I recently completed over 1500 benchmark
runs at this point product availability
is good for both companies and consumers
can easily pick up a graphics card at
the advertised MSRP so it'll be nice to
make some recommendations without having
to take inflated prices into account the
following GPU Peaks are based primarily
on that data gathered from the current
generation GPU benchmark video just
mentioned but some of my own personal
preferences at each price point will
help me determine a will weigh on my
Peaks so keep that in mind and when my
sort of personal preferences do come up
I will discuss those anyway let's get on
with it
starting with what I like to call the
entry-level GPUs for those with roughly
$100 to spend you of the choice of
either the rx 460 or gtx 1050 for me the
geforce gtx 1050 2 gigabytes seems like
the obvious choice here it was 13%
faster at 1080p in our recent benchmark
video and given it cost just 10% more
that gives it a slightly better cost per
frame ratio thats there was such a small
margin you could really go either way
the reason I'm going green here is down
to the fact that the gtx 1050 is
actually a greener product consuming
less power despite being faster also a
big win for me is the fact that in order
to extract maximum performance from this
graphics card and extend
power connecter isn't required some will
no doubt argue that the RX 460 unlock
which brews performance by roughly 5%
makes it a better buy well in my opinion
it doesn't yes if the unlock does work
you can look forward to up to 5% more
performance but with aimed at
effectively blocking the unlock with
their relived drivers it just isn't
worth the hassle in my opinion so let's
lock in the GTX 1050 and move on moving
on to what I'm calling the budget
mid-range segment we have a rather
open-and-shut case for months now we've
been calling the RX 470 the best value
mid-range contender and with ambhi's
improved relive drivers and invidious
unwillingness to drop prices of the GTX
1063 gigabyte it remains the valued
champ
in short the RX 474 gigabyte is just 5%
slower than the gtx 1033 gigabyte while
it's priced 15% lower
meanwhile the 1052 i gets touched up
worse than any race car driven by
Richard Hammond it's a complete
write-off when looking at the cost per
frame ratios the 1052 I is over 30%
slower and less than 20% cheaper for
those of you are wondering should you
buy the a kilobyte version of the RX 470
short answer hell no that would be a
worse decision than the hamster calling
back into another rocket car although
the RS 470 really isn't a great deal
slower than the true mid-range
contenders I know that this is the pic
that will interest many of you guys the
most it's probably also the one that
will get fanboys scrambling for the
dislike button if they don't happen to
agree with me anyway not at all
concerned with that let's get to it not
beating around the bush the three
gigabyte GTX 1060 gets wiped out by the
RX 484 gigabyte as the radeon GPU was
faster in our latest benchmark session
meanwhile the full gigabyte 480 was just
5% slower than the 8 gigabyte model
while costing a little over 15% less
we're still foreigner the 4 gigabyte 480
was just 2% slower than the 6 gigabyte
1060 despite costing around 20% less
since day one we've been recommending
the 4G by our X 480 over the more
expensive at gigabyte model and we're
yet to discover a playable scenario
where the a gigabyte model provides
better performance
for example when using our 8 gigabyte
AMD reference card which can be limited
to a full gigabyte buffer using a custom
bios we found no difference in
performance between running the card
with a full gigabyte or 8 gigabyte
memory buffer and yes we also looked at
frame time performance anyway if using
it spending the extra money now means
that the our X 480 will be future
proofed then go for it either way I pick
- the RX 480 as the best value mid-range
performance option for around $400
gamers will run into the geforce gtx
1070 and so now this graphics card has
no real competition a bit like a polar
bear in a petting zoo it tears
everything else to pieces of course you
are paying for those pixels to glide
over your screen in perfect harmony
you could argue the fury X is the word
the alternative but for roughly the same
price there are too many shortcomings
for me to recommend that product I'll
have a video on this soon but for now I
feel like the more modern gtx 1070 is
where your money is best invested moving
on to something more extreme we find the
geforce gtx 1080 something like this big
beefy sucker from gigabyte their extreme
edition card and there are some that
will argue that the 1080 is really just
a mid-range GPU with a high-end price
judo will act competition and you know
that may be the case but the truth is a
$300 1080
apart from being awesome for gamers
would probably also see AMD go the way
of the dodo faster than the t1 0 to 100
time regardless of your opinion there is
no changing the fact that upon release
eight months ago now the 1080 smashed
out of the park delivering 30% more
performance than the gtx 980ti and fury
x and if the framerate performance
wasn't impressive enough the power
consumption was sure to blow some socks
clean off as the gtx 1080 consumes no
more powers and last season's gtx 980
and that there is an incredible leap and
efficiency having settled at a cost of
roughly $600 u.s. the gtx 1080s cost per
frame ratio in relation to the mid-range
current generation gps isn't great
essentially you are paying almost a
hundred and forty percent more
so not quite 70% more performance when
compared to the six gigabyte GTX 1060 of
course high-end GPUs have always come at
a price premium so this isn't exactly
surprising in any case if you seek
extreme 1440p or even 4k performance
then there really is no better
alternative how right now there is no
alternative so to recap the pics are as
follows the geforce gtx 1050 2 gigabyte
radeon RX 474 gigabyte radio an RX 484
gigabyte geforce gtx 1070 and the
geforce gtx 1080 that pretty much makes
up the a-team i think it's fair to say
right now the entry level or mid-range
market segment is very competitive and
excluding the geforce gtx 750ti
there aren't really any poor choices
here as a side note i should point out
that as AMD's previous generation GPUs
head out the door there are some great
bargains to be had many of you have been
pointing to AMD's Radeon Fury the
air-cooled non ex model and it just
shows $300 u.s. it does seem like a
great Buy
that said the sapphire nitro model which
is selling for just under 300 dollars
u.s. is only available in limited
quantities and pricing isn't great
everywhere for example it's a horrible
purchase down under anyways inclusion I
think it's fair to say it's great seeing
such strong competition in the $100 to
about 250 dollar price range and let's
really hope AMD can help us out very
soon in the high-end market segment and
if it's not too much to ask bring down
those prices just a little bit and yeah
anyway if you disagree with some of my
picks or perhaps all of them let me know
in the comments section below
I'm your host Steve and I'll catch you
on the next one
