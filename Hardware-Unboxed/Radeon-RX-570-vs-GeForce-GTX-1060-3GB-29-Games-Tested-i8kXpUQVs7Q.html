battle recently I checked in how the
Radeon rx 580 and GeForce GTX 1060
compared in 27 games and found that
overall performance was very similar the
RX 580 offered just two and a half
percent more performance overall in the
end I acknowledged you really could go
either way depending on preference that
said I picked the rx 580 as I
appreciated it slightly better
performance in modern titles its
superior low-level API numbers and the
fact that free sync is a strong selling
point for mid-range graphics cards also
the fact the MSRP is around $20 u.s.
lower helped out and it got the red team
over the line for me well the dust has
settled on that one and 1400 comments
later the Internet's a better place so I
guess it's time to stir up the hornet's
nest and do it all over again
in an effort to do just that I'll be
taking new Radeon rx 570 and putting it
head-to-head against the geforce gtx
1063 gigabyte now in a perfect world
where graphics card availability isn't
an issue the RX 570 should come in at
about 170 dollars u.s. making it a good
bit cheaper than the $200 three gigabyte
gtx 1060 right now though more than a
month since the RX 570 was released
cards are still selling for $200 u.s.
and availability is poor at best
therefore right now it's actually easier
and cheaper to pick up a three gigabyte
GTX 1060 and there's a nice MSI model
selling for $180 u.s. for example
anyway in terms of pricing they are
quite similar and predictably
availability will eventually improve for
the RX 570 so I guess the next question
is which one should you buy well to find
out we have 29 games on the menu all of
which have been tested at the 1080p and
1440p resolutions on our Intel Core i7
77 arcade test system which has been
clocked at 4.9 to us please like my
focus will almost be entirely on the
1080p resolution as I feel this is
primarily where gamers seeking this
caliber of graphics card will be gaming
representing the green team at MSI with
their GTX 1060 gaming x3g and for the
red team we have gigabyte with their
aura
and rx5 74g MSI's applied a 4% factory
overclock to their card while gigabytes
gone with a slightly more mild 3%
overclock so much of a muchness then
kick starting things off we have a bit
of an oldie but we did test with the
updated HD client quite a few of you do
seem to enjoy playing World of Tanks so
this is a game I've started including it
a lot of my tests the game does appear
to prefer in video hardware as the 1060
was 8% faster
that said though for those gaming at
higher resolutions the green teams
advantage in this title will become more
significant
now we're going from blowing up tanks to
jacking cars and throwing grenades at
prostitutes if you have Brian from tech
city the yes man's an oddball anyway
like World of Tanks we find that Grand
Theft Auto is another game at favor the
Green Team quite heavily I might add the
1060 offered 22% more frames at 1080p
and in fact the minimum was greater than
that of the RX 5 70s average The Witcher
3 is the last pre 2016 title that I've
tested and it's another game that favors
the gtx 1060 over the RX 570 this time
by 9% margin that said though i do test
this game with hair works enabled you
know because nvidia bias and all that
noise right so next up we have rise of
the Tomb Raider you guys ever tried
swimming in this game I recommend you
check it out
where was I yeah the 1080p results for
the rx 570 it's a fraction fast on the
GTX 1060 when comparing the average
frame rate but a country mile ahead for
the minimum whereas the GTX 1060 dropped
down to 31 fps the radio and bottom data
just 41 fps impressive stuff from the
red team given this is an Nvidia
sponsored title ashes the benchmark has
been included because well it's a 29
game benchmark video how needed the
numbers at 1080p we see a 53 FPS average
for both GPUs though the 1060 did manage
a slightly better minimum result moving
to 1440p weighs heavily in the favor of
the RX 570 Far Cry primal generally goes
the way of the green team and we
certainly see this one comparing the GTX
1060 and rx 570 I'm not going to say the
margins were extreme but the 1060 was
faster at both resolutions and enjoy the
9% advantage
TEP Tom Clancy's the division was tested
exclusively using DirectX 12 and you
could argue that using DirectX 11 would
afford the ten sixty one or two more
frames an O'Brien would it's a fair
point on it would see performance much
the same between the two GPUs
nevertheless this is an apples to apples
comparison and the 570 was 3% faster I'd
get this away much on the overall result
next up we have hitman yes I've included
hitman much to the delight of those Hulk
colored fanboys this title does deal in
video quite the below as the RX 570 was
18 percent faster hitting an average of
80 fps to the 10 60 68 fps whereas AMD
fans get hitman Nvidia fans get quantum
break see how that works here the 10 60
was 9 percent faster an average at 1080p
with a rather healthy 70 FPS though the
RX 570 did manage to keep the average
above 60 FPS at all times so overall
gameplay was very smooth okay time for
overwatch or rather the Zarya benchmark
where I let 12 areas set on easy mode
loose to run around and pretty much just
annoy each other
tomatoe Thanos areas were harmed during
this benchmark using the epic quality
preset both mid-range GPUs provided very
respectable performance and quite
shockingly the rx 570 just managed to
edge your head of the 10 60 in this one
doing provides little challenge for
these GPUs at 1080p and both averaged
well over 100 FPS at all times in our
test scene the RX 570 was on average 12%
fast the GTX 1060 but again with both
pushing over 120 FPS at 1080p and well
over 60 FPS at 1440p it's not really a
significant win for the red team
total war Warhammer throws up some
interesting results here we see the RX
570 leading when it comes to the average
frame rate but falling quite far behind
for the minimum result performance was
still very smooth on the AMD card but it
kind of makes it difficult to call a
winner here the 1060 pulled back in the
lead for Mirror's Edge catalyst beating
the RX 570 by convincing 12 percent
margin at Sony P that said though both
cards did push over 60 FPS at all times
the 1060 remained ahead for f1 2016
though with just three fps in it
for the average and 1fps when comparing
the minimum frame rate at yupi it was a
close battle indeed although Deus Ex
mankind divided is an AMD sponsored tile
and we tested using the DirectX 12 API
the GTX 1060 performs admirably at 1080p
matching the rx 570 the GTX 1060 was
overwhelmed at 1440p and I'd say this is
a VRAM capacity issue that's it with an
average of just 34 fps for the rx 570 it
wasn't exactly smooth on either graphics
card battlefield 1 provided a very even
battle between these two budget
heavyweights basically we ended up with
a dead heat at 1080p while the RX 570
was able to edge a head by a 5% margin
at 1440p as I mentioned earlier I am
mostly concerned with type II
performance in this video so it was
great to see both GPUs maintaining well
over 60 fps at all times
Omar cs3 how is it that after six months
since your release it still takes a gtx
1080 to play it tell you P using the
higher quality settings and it's not
like the games easy to tweak either it
only offers a low medium or high preset
so we're not testing with some kind of
extreme hyper type quality setting
anyway even at 1080p both GPUs fail to
get anywhere near 60 FPS so the 1060 13
percent victory here is a bit hollow
that's said downgrading to the medium
quality preset will boost performance
and the 1060 should maintain its lead
Gears of War 4 is another Nvidia
sponsored title this time a DX 12 title
so this helps the 1060 hang in there
with the rx 570 overall performance was
much the same on both graphics cards at
1080p though the RX 570 did pull ahead
at 1440p titanfall 2 is an AMD special
though it has to be said I was expecting
the RX 570 be more than 5% faster than
the GTX 1060 here still though both did
maintain over 60 FPS at all times
when playing at the 1080p resolution we
see yet another close battle in
Civilization 6 this time the RX 570 was
6% faster at Sony P though this did only
account for a for FPS advantage I should
note that the minimum frame rate
performance was much the same in fact
the GTX 1060 was 1 FPS faster here black
titanfall 2 called the dream front
warfare is another AMD special and the
time it really shows the are x57 you
enjoyed a massive 16% performance
advantage over the GTX 1060 at 1080p and
here the five seventies minimum frame
rate was greater than ten sixties
average so a very strong wind frame D
here indeed fresh off their biggest win
AMD now suffers through their greatest
loss in another title released in
November of 2016 here we see when
playing dishonored to the 1060 is 25%
faster than the 570 and that's obviously
a big deal whereas the 570 dips down to
40 fps the 1016 never dropped below 50
fps
the GTX 1060 was again faster than the
570 this time when testing with
watchdogs to hear it enjoyed a 10
percent performance advantage at 1080p
when comparing the average frame rate
that's as though the 570 did do better
when comparing the minimum frame rate
though it was just two fps faster and
okay what's going on here before you ask
no I didn't accidentally test the 10 60
at the 4k resolution using the very high
quality preset Resident Evil 7 is
extremely demanding on vrm as a result
the 1063 gear like completely tanks I
had planned to see how far you had to
relax the quality settings before the
three gigabyte card comes to life but
sadly I ran out of time I'm actually
going to end up putting the final
touches on this video just hours before
I end up getting on a plane to head to
Computex so these results will have to
do for now though I do feel they're a
little incomplete moving on both GPUs
did a great job with ferrata averaging
over 70 FPS with a minimum of 57 FPS the
GTX 1060 was a fraction faster overall
but as you can see performance was very
similar even at 1440p Tom Clancy's Ghost
Recon wildlands played into favor of the
GTX 1060 here it was 11% faster than the
rx 570 at turvy P that said at 1440
Peter 5:7 he came back as it often does
and match the GTX 1060 the GTX 1060
manages to come away with the win in
Mass Effect Andromeda edging out the RX
570 by 6 percent margin at 1080p the
1600 also managed to maintain its lead
at 1440p though with both GPUs rendering
less than 40 FPS on average you will
want to reduce the quality settings a
bit more here next up we have dawn of
war 3 and this one went the way of the
red team here the RX 5
70 was 8% faster the GTX 1060 though
both did perform very well at 1080p
wrapping things up as prey and for the
last game we have a rather well put
together game with excellent
optimization this means even with the
very high quality settings in play both
GPU smash through the 60 FPS barrier at
1080p the 1600 though did come out on
top delivering 11% more performance and
yes we did test with the latest version
of the game in the words of Jeremy
Clarkson power yes time to look at the
power consumption and unfortunately in
this case more isn't better Jeremy
wouldn't understand the rx 570 push
total system consumption almost 300
watts which frankly is still very
manageable despite the fact that the
same system with the 1060 consumed
almost 20% less okay so we're nearing
the end of our journey to discover which
brand offers the best mid-range budget
contender is it AMD or is it Nvidia -
the swoosh effect and as we find all too
often it's either or is it both well
whatever the case the RX 570 ends up
delivering just a single extra frame on
average at IEP and surprisingly just 2
extra frames at 1440p that said this
graph does take into account those
resident evil 7 results which were
massive outliers let me show you what I
mean
if we include all the results this is
what the overall picture looks like as
you can see it's pretty even across the
board until you're throwing that one
game where the GTX 1063 you get like
completely tanked for now this game is
clearly an outlier as we didn't see any
other situations where the RX 570
provided playable performance while the
GTX 10 63 gigabyte failed I'm keen to
see just how much you have to downgrade
the quality settings before the 1060
recovers in that title but like I said
it'll have to wait till I get back from
Computex
for now if we remove the outlier the RX
570 actually ends up being 2% slower
overall but to be fair the results are
still very even the RX 570 was faster in
13 games and slower in 14 while they
tied in a single title so as we often
find there's really no clear winner here
it simply boils down to what games you
play when deciding which GPU is best for
do they both have their strengths and
weaknesses for 1063 gigabytes greatest
weakness is of course the limited memory
buffer but to be fair at 1080p this is
rarely an issue the three-year buy model
was released almost a year ago now and
back then we heard how it was dead on
arrival even for those gaming at 1080p
well with the exception of one game we
have 28 other examples that show the 3
gigabyte 1060 providing very playable
performance at 1080p and no there wasn't
any stuttering or micro stuttering or
anything like that I've checked all the
frame time data the three gigabyte card
performs very well I just haven't shown
the point one percent one percent lows
for the GPU testings as most prefer the
minimum and average this might be
something I'll change in the future I am
doing it for CPU testing but now for GPU
testing the minimum seems to show
exactly what the 1% does for almost
every test anyway if you bought a three
gigabyte model last year you're probably
wondering what all the fuss is about the
advantage of the 1060 is considerably
better power consumption more
overclocking Headroom and cooler
operating temperatures the advantage of
the RX 570 is of course the slightly
larger VM buffer which did seem to help
us out of trouble as we saw strong
performance across the board and finally
the availability of an impressive range
of free sync monitors is also a big
bonus so which one would I go with next
question please really it comes down to
which one's the cheapest and the games
that you intend on playing I do feel
like the RX 570 is probably the safest
bet but I also really like the lower
power consumption of the GTX 1063
gigabyte which generally allows board
partners to put on cooler sound well
create cooler graphics cards that are
quieter that's what I'm trying to say
cooler and quiet cool and quiet I think
that was a thing once it's also a better
pairing for budget builds in my opinion
that use lesser quality power supplies
really though basing your decision on
which one I would pick might not be the
best choice on this one and not just
because I really don't know which one I
would pick of the two comes down to a
few things for example if you have a
free sync monitor or you plan on getting
one in the near future then I'd say the
RX 570 becomes the obvious choice
that said though if you already have a
monitor that doesn't support an adaptive
vsync technology and you have no plans
to upgrade your monitor in the near
future and you play games that tend to
favor the green team then the GTX 1060
might be the smarter choice in the end
of giving you a heap of information and
data in the hope that you can now make
an informed buying decision and I'm
going to leave it at that for this one I
really need to go pack my bags and head
to the airport I'm super excited about
the Computex trip this year and the fact
that MSI has sponsored the channel is a
seriously big deal if you love what we
do at harbor unboxed and you really want
to support the channel then please be
sure to check out all our Computex
coverage over the next week that'll
really help us out after that though
when I get back from combi Tex I will be
jumping right back into the benchmarking
I'm your host Steve C against there and
guys
