have a build video i built a few new pcs
this year but i don't believe i've built
a single mini ITX rig which i have to
say is a real surprise as they're
usually my favorite to put together mini
ITX builds usually throught a few
challenges which makes the process a
little more enjoyable at least it does
in my opinion they also look great and
cramming a high-end desktop build into a
compact case well that just never gets
old
the purpose of today's build is to
upgrade my wife's computer she's a
graphic designer slash photographer and
she does a lot of work with magazine
layouts so this means she spends a lot
of time in adobe indesign and of course
uses Photoshop as well after a minute I
have kind of neglected to keep her
computer up-to-date over the years
though having said that she's been
pretty happy with the setup that she's
had up until now it's done pretty much
everything she's needed to do it's just
started to run into some problems
recently and every time I've offered
previously to upgrade it she said it's
fine don't bother now though it is time
to bother so we've pulled the old system
apart which is in the Thermaltake
suppressor f1 as you can see it's pretty
well being gutted now and that did have
a core i5 46 70 K CPU I don't know if it
was overclocked I honestly can't recall
and that was on the asrock z87 II ITX
motherboard so that's obviously still in
there I had 16 gigabytes of memory ddr3
memory and it had a fairly underwhelming
radeon r7 250 graphics card but that's
all she needed for the work that she was
doing in the last month or so though the
old Haswell quad core rig has started
running out of memory and this has
caused issues with InDesign there's
really no cost-effective option to solve
the RAM capacity issue because as you
just saw the Mini ITX board only has two
slots so we'd have to ditch the 16 we've
gotten try and find a 32 gigabyte kit
definitely not worth the hassle so about
a month ago I decided to quickly hack
together a Rison 7 test bill with 32
gigabytes of ddr4 memory to see how that
played with the Adobe software she was
using the upgrade was significant and
very noticeable in design layouts would
work at the
resolution and there's no stuttering or
slowdown when scrolling through the
pages Photoshop was also noticeably
better working with high-resolution RAW
images was smooth and the Rison 7 system
never complained about the workload so
with that successful test run complete
it was time to build the new workhorse
it was strongly suggested to me that I
stick with a mini ITX system she wants
to keep it on her desk but doesn't want
it to take up too much room she was very
happy with the suppressor f1 that she
had hi it wasn't an issue here the only
requirement was a small footprint so
this afforded me the opportunity to
finally create a built-in e fantex
evolve shift for this one I'm yet again
sticking with asrock this time using
their new fatality a be 350 gaming ITX
AC my favorite mini ITX a m4 motherboard
then coming to the rescue and solving
the memory issue is team group with
their team t force Vulcan and 32
gigabyte ddr4 2,400 memory kit ideally I
would have liked a higher clocked memory
kit for this build but capacity was the
main concern I really needed to vi
thinking about sticks and it's possible
with some cheating that you can get more
out of this memory and I played around
in the BIOS and was able to get this
memory running at ddr4 3000 speeds
simply by loading the XMP profile and
then upping the frequency while leaving
the timings the same so you are
overclocking the memory your mileage may
vary but this memory did seem to
overclock very well moving on powering
the build i have the silverstone sx 650
g a compact sfx power supply with a be
650 watt output it also has an 80 plus
gold certification and a fully modular
design so it's perfect for this mini ITX
build I was pretty keen to get started
with the build of so much so that I
rushed the planning stage and well that
turned out to be a bit of a mistake for
a few reasons not a disaster but a few
things did go wrong my first error was
requesting the fan tech speed HTC 12 LS
for the build it's a great little cooler
but I ran into not one but two problems
right off the bat the second of which I
will get to in a moment but that one
proved fatal for the coolers inclusion
the first issue that I ran into was
actually the lack of a m4 support so
that should have been an obvious one and
cooller hasn't been updated to offer
support either I told you my complete
lack of planning backfired on this one
anyway I did work around this issue with
the help of two small washers which I
used to jerry-rig
the cooler to the hem for socket and
this worked surprisingly well I was able
to create even pressure for a perfectly
flush connection with the CPUs heat
spreader thermals were good
that was until I decided to install the
glass panel on the side of the case for
my final testing and I realized that the
120 millimeter fan had about 4
millimeters of breathing room between
and the glass so that kind of limited
how efficient the fan was and thermals
did rise a bit it was still manageable
but you wouldn't have been at overclock
the way it was set up and it just didn't
really make that much sense it looked
cool but didn't make that much sense
again how I planned the build this issue
probably would have been spotted ahead
of time anyway I've never worked with
the fan tax of old shift before so this
entire build was a bit of a learning
process or rather learners you go
process which probably isn't the best
way to do it it's the way I did it this
time I knew the case was designed to
take advantage of all in one liquid
coolers and I thought well I'll chuck in
Vegas 64 and really see what it can do
and then use this air cool of it that's
obviously backfired and didn't work out
you can install a pair of 120 millimeter
radiators it's possible put one in the
bottom like I have here and then one in
the front but it's very tight you have
to sort of orientate them in a specific
way and it's just it's very crammed I
didn't like it so I decided to ditch
that I also has a bit concerned about
thermals and since I'm not going with a
Vegas 64 liquid card in this for my wife
I decided to just pull that out I'm not
going with the Titan X either but that's
sort of beside the point kind of anyway
that's how its configured for now truth
be told though the system really doesn't
require that much 3d rendering power so
the Pascal Titan X is obviously overkill
for this build and I will go for
something maybe like a GTX 1060 will
find its way into the final build
now with the 120 millimeter rad spot
freed up I grabbed the cooler master
master liquid 120 and relocated the
jazzy looking Corsair ll 120 fan and
I've got that rotating between orange
and red
and that looks pretty cool all up I
would have to say if I'm being honest I
built this system probably about four
times or at least the majority of it
shuffling things around a cable
management took a bit of messing about
and of course I changed quite a few
components from the original
configuration so yeah quite a lot of
work went into building it but had a lot
of fun doing it and yeah although it was
probably the worst planned build I've
done this year I did have a lot of fun
it was probably one of my most fun
builds actually of the year I enjoyed it
sort of tuning it and tweaking it and
getting it a little bit better each time
I did it and working out working at the
best way to build in the shift it was
just a lot of fun I know I probably need
to get out more
anyway now that's complete I decided to
run a few temperature tests and I've
left the front 140 millimeter fan that's
exhausting air at the front I can feel
it blowing all the air out so I've left
that exhausting and then we've got the
120 millimeter fan in the bottom and
that's pushing air out through the
radiator so basically both fans are
sucking air out of the case they're both
exhaust fans and they're the only fans
that we have in the system and then
they'll be sucking you know the air that
they're pushing out will be drawn in
through the ventilation here so
hopefully that works pretty well I have
to say I'm a little concerned it does
have very well appear step very limited
airflow only those two fans of course
each side panel is non-ventilated
because they are temporary glass panels
and doesn't a pin that would be a whole
lot of airflow over the motherboard vrm
area not too worried about the graphics
card on the other side that should
pretty well take care of itself but
anyway we'll jump into the temperature
results and see what's what first up I
ran the Ida stress test stressing both
the CPU and FPU and here are the results
out of the box so that is to say these
stock operating clock speeds the horizon
7 1700 X maxed out at just 59 degrees
while the motherboards verum heatsink
reached 62 degrees
I used a thermal probe to measure the
underside of the heatsink and reported
the maximum temperature after the
hour-long stress test and for anyone
wondering for all of these tests I did
have an ambient room temperature of 21
degrees overclocking the 1700 X to 3.9
gigahertz which is the maximum frequency
I banaue to achieve with the CP on any
motherboard 10
preachers did saw to a very warm 82
degrees still this is a very safe
operating temperature so no problems
there
the vrm heatsink picked at 71 degrees
which is also very safe for the most
part you're not going to be stressing
the CPU as hard as the Ida 64 stress
test so what can you expect when gaming
for this test I used Battlefield one and
recorded the temperature over an hour of
gameplay although the CPU isn't working
as hard the Titan X is now pumping out
heat a lot of heat though most of it is
forced at the top of the fan Tex case
thankfully a few things worth noting the
Titan X basically targets 84 degrees
under load the fans spin up at whatever
speed is required to maintain a thermal
limit of 84 degrees and when the fans
are maxed out you will start to see the
GPU throttle in order to maintain an 84
degree temperature so even on an open
test bed the card will quickly hit 84
degrees and then maintain that
temperature under load I should also
note the Titan wasn't overclocked in
either of these tests just the rise in
seven CPU is overclocked and finally the
Titan X was surprising quite as the fan
speed max tell it just 2400 rpm so as
you can see when gaming despite the
Titan X now pumping out quite a lot of
heat the CPU and motherboard actually
ran cooler as they're not being stressed
as heavily as they were in the previous
tests in summary the operating
temperatures when gaming are very
impressive and the system was also very
quiet only the Titan X could be heard
when gaming and even then it wasn't
particularly loud overall I'm very
impressed with how this builds turned
out and it's just occurred to me that
this is actually the first ever and I
mean first ever AMD powered mini ITX
system that I've personally built I
don't think I ever slapped together an
FM 2 mini ITX system and pretty certain
I never built an a m1 rig so this is
probably I'm fairly certain my first
ever AMD Mini ITX build that I've had
the pleasure of putting together the
only item I would change in this build
if I was buying it or making it for
myself and I'm assuming gaming's on the
table here maybe a home theater PC
gaming or something along those lines I
would go for probably a GeForce GTX 1080
that would be a really nice fit really
good for 1440p gaming and a complement
this really well so with the Rison 7:17
hundred X 32 gigabytes of ddr4 memory a
samsung 960 pro 512 gigabyte SSD and the
gtx 1080
plus all the other stuff such as the
silverstone psu the asrock mini ITX
motherboard and of course the fantex
shift case you're looking at about
$2,000 us all up considering what you
get for that money this in my opinion is
an exceptional rig 1440p or 144 hertz
gaming won't be an issue
nor will serious productivity work it's
really a jack-of-all-trades and it takes
up just a hundred and seventy by two
hundred and seventy four millimeters of
desk space it's also quite and allows
for very reasonable operating
temperatures especially for a case
that's allowed that in tempered glass I
love it and I hope you guys enjoyed the
build video that's going to do it for
this one I'm your host Steve catch again
