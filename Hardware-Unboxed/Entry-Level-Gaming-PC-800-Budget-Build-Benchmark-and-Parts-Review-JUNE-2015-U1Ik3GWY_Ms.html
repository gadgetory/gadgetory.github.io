I'm your host Matt and today we're going
to build the best gaming system possible
with an $800 budget our budget today
doesn't include your monitor keyboard
mouse speakers or any software a lot of
people are gonna have this left over
from a previous build and that sort of
stuff really does come down to personal
preference our focus with this build is
on 1080p gaming as this covers most
monitors from the 24 to 27 inch range so
let's check out the hardware that we've
chosen bang for your buck nothing beats
the latest range of fourth generation as
well core i3 processors when it comes to
general usage it's almost impossible to
tell between a core i3 system to a core
i5 or even the core i7 for the most part
this is generally true for gaming too
especially with low to mid-range GPUs
therefore we've gone with the affordable
core i3 4170 which comes clocked at 3.7
gigahertz and costs just 135 bucks with
a few dozen options picking the right
motherboard can be tough although this
is an entry-level system we decided
against an Intel h97 motherboard the z97
version cost us $20 more and you get a
few extra features that can be handy
down the track such as overclocking as
standard all dead 97 motherboards should
provide 6 USB 3 ports you give it
Ethernet and 6 SATA 3 ports the cheapest
and best values at 97 motherboards come
from a drop in our opinion and we
decided on the z97 empro 4 this is a
micro ATX motherboard and although we're
using an ATX mid tower it is possible to
opt for a smaller micro ATX case if you
wish if you want an ATX size motherboard
for a few dollars less as Rocksteady 97
anniversary is also an option the days
of skating by with just four gigabytes
of RAM almost over imaginable invest now
in an anchor
kid after all it's just $50 the g.skill
ripjaws x-series 8 gigabyte ddr3 2133
kit is a serious bargain we don't see my
Stenson saving $20 to get a 4 gigabyte
kit we recommend a minimum memory speed
of 1866 megahertz for the current
generation Intel Haswell processors know
dearly you should aim for 21 33
megahertz or even 20 400 megahertz with
a budget of $800 it doesn't leave a
whole lot of moolah for your GPU which
is most likely going to be the most
expensive component gamers will most
likely be limited into a sub $200 option
thankfully that buys you a very powerful
GPU right now especially if you plan on
1080p gaming bang on $200 we landed the
EVGA geforce gtx 960 2 gigabyte a CX 2.0
+ graphics card this card features a
nice dual fan cooler that keeps the gtx
960 cool and quiet there isn't a
reference design for the gtx 960 from
what we've seen all manufacturers are
offering solid products so you don't
necessarily have to go with EVGA really
I'd suggest picking up the cheapest gtx
960 that you can find for audio we're
relying on the integrated Realtek ALC
892 codec which is found on the
motherboard this isn't the greatest
option but unless you're spending
serious dollars and your headphones or
speakers this is going to be fine right
now the best value SSDs without a doubt
crucial is VX 100 and since $100 gets to
the 250 gigabyte model that's what we've
gone for personally I find 120 view
bytes it's just not enough these days
especially with the way games growing in
science the 250 gigabyte model allows
you to have all your favorite games
installed as well as all the essentials
for everything else that won't fit or
doesn't need to be on the snappy SSD
we've got a secondary hard drive the
Western Digital Black Series is a little
pricey but for reliability it's
excellent and for a hard drive that
performance is pretty good personally I
haven't found the need for an optical
drive in many years now but if you do
need one the Samsung DVD rewrite is
available for about 20 bucks corsair CX
series power supply units are an
excellent choice of basic system builds
and pasty upgrades
see f-series PS use are available in a
variety of power configurations and
include features that are normally found
earning a premium power supplies since
the core i3 and gtx 960 combo won't draw
a great deal of power an overclocking is
essentially off the table for 30 watts
iax will be ample however we do only
happen to have the CX 750m on hand
it's obviously where it affect
performance at all this is the first
time I've used a deep cool product but
for just $40 the tesseract SW really
caught my attention this ultra
affordable case looks pretty good
features an eye-catching window and even
comes with a pair of blue LED 120
millimeter fans
the tesseract SW is painted inside now
offers plenty of room for radiators can
handle full-size 310 millimeter long
GPUs 165 millimeter tall CPU coolers and
230 millimeter long power supplies what
more could you ask for of this price now
I've got it all installed let's run a
few benchmarks and see how it performs
we have reached 24 frames per second
when playing project cars with a very
demanding wet weather conditions
while the clear conditions allow for a
much smoother 50 frames per second
Witcher 3 Wild Hunt was very playable
with an average of 45 frames per second
with everything turned up with the
exception of Nvidia hare works which was
disabled why time to wake up and master
these lessons so boring they put you to
sleep - dying light average 38 frames
per second with everything turned up at
1080p Far Cry 4 was very playable for
the smooth 55 frames per second on
average for $800 for all the core
components this entry level gaming
system allow gamers to enjoy all the
latest triple-a titles at 1080p
factoring the cost of a good quality
monitor keyboard mouse and speakers are
headphones you'd expect the total cost
of hardware to come in at about $1,100
