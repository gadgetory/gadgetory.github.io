we're taking a closer look at the
gigabyte Aero 15x from 2018 which was
launched alongside Intel's new H series
coffee-like processes a couple of weeks
ago we've already covered the new CPUs
in depth and you should definitely check
out that video if you haven't already so
today we'll be focusing more on
gigabytes top-end new laptop I looked at
the original era 15 last year and was
pretty impressed with most aspects the
era 15 X between 18 isn't a massive
change from what gigabyte established
with the original model but we do get
some key improvements to hardware and
other changes that refine the laptop and
gigabyte is key to stress that this
isn't just a gaming laptop but a machine
designed for productivity and that shows
with features like an X right certified
display that I'll get into later the key
piece of new hardware is of course the
Intel Core i7
8750 H which brings six cores to laptops
for the first time and presents a decent
upgrade over the older quad core Core i7
7700 HQ particularly for productivity
the GPU options stay the same an nvidia
geforce gtx 1060 in the base model and a
gtx 1070 max q in the area 15 X version
we're looking at today the SSD is still
512 gigabytes and we get a single 16 gig
stick of daily are for one of the other
key improvements is the new 15.6 inch
1080p display this new panel will no
doubt be used across a wide range of
laptops as it provides a 144 Hertz
refresh rate at this size for the first
time previously we were limited to 120
Hertz on most laptops so the 24 Hertz
increase is nice for those who like to
game at the upper end of frame rates and
you don't get g-sync with this display
which I thought was a little strange
though is likely to keep costs down
juice Inc would have improved the
smoothness of games particularly when
running below 60fps but provided you're
pushing into the 80 plus FPS range not
having adaptive sync isn't a massive
issue in fact let's talk a bit more
about this display because it's one of
the
interesting aspects of this laptop
similar to the last model the new era 15
X has super slim bezels around three of
the sides which makes the overall size
of this laptops more and maximizes the
screen real estate you can get in the
available space I really love this sort
of design I wish more companies would
opt for this similar type of bezel set
up it does have a few drawbacks though
most notably the webcam position below
the display gives you a rather
unpleasant angle in your video calls I
don't personally use the webcam very
often so it's not a big deal for me but
anyone that is a frequent user it should
be aware of this trade-off gamers get to
enjoy the 144 Hunt's refresh rate of
this panel but professionals don't miss
out at all either the error 15x like its
predecessor is X right Pantone certified
meaning the display is factory
calibrated to the srgb standard this is
a key feature for professionals that
demand color accurate displace and while
the calibration is provided through a
simple software profile it's better than
the complete lack of calibration you get
with most laptop displays as the panel
on the 2018 aro 15 X is different to the
last gen model some aspects to display
performance have changed brightness has
increased to around 320 nits up from 218
it's and that brings a small increase in
contrast as well viewing angles are
still quite good too thanks to
calibration average temperature and
gamma are almost spot-on with a
relatively even performance across the
grayscale range my arrow 15 X unit is
less accurate than the original arrow 15
I tested an average greyscale Delta a of
1.6 - as opposed to 0.5 - with the
previous model but both results are
under 2.0 which is still pretty good
it's also likely that just one display
profile was created for all area 15 X
laptops so there will be some natural
variance between units saturation and
color checker results in at a de of 2.34
and 2.59 respectively so around 1.0
higher than with the original area 15
not as rock-solid accurate as I'd like
to see as we got with the original while
it was a little bit more accurate but
still a pretty respectable result and
certainly a lot better than most laptops
gaming laptops in particular often
fairly inaccurate but the error 15 X is
good in this regard and provides that
extra
fresh track 2 which is always nice to
see enough about the display though
you're probably sick of hearing about
calm and fire results by now let's talk
design and construction which hasn't
changed significantly compared to the
original arrow 15 the body is a mix of
metal and plastic with several seams
around the place that doesn't quite give
it the same premium feel as the best
metal body laptops the good news is the
body is extremely solid with basically
no flex in any area even if you're
mashing the keyboard speaking of the
keyboard once again you get an
individually RGB LED backlit keyboard
with a solid tactile feel and of course
a handy numpad I really like how this
keyboard feels to type on so it's
perfect for whacking together a word
document and naturally it's good for
gaming too the ELN trackpad is okay
there was still prefer a higher-end
trackpad with better more precise
tracking if you're like ports the area
15 X has got plenty of them three USB
3.0 type-a ports I found about three USB
C port Ethernet HDMI 2.0 mini
DisplayPort one point for a single 3.5
mm audio jack and a fast UHS 2 SD card
reader the air 15 X is chassis is still
very portable at 18 0.9 millimeters
thick and approximately 2 kilograms
heavy not including the necessary power
brick of course it's not the slimmest
all lightest laptop I've seen with these
specs but it's more compact extremely
solid and far more portable than cheaper
thicker gaming laptops after all you're
paying for the portability and gigabyte
certainly has delivered here amazingly
these sorts of dimensions have been
achieved without skimping on the battery
which remains at a huge 94 watt hours
want to know what the inside of the air
15 X looks like well let's take a look
with the t6 screwdriver and a spudger
it's pretty straightforward to remove
the bottom panel exposing again a
standard layout here the battery sits at
the bottom while there's a dual fan
cooler with two heat pipes at the top
sending heat away from the central GPU
and CPU to the remarkably tiny heat
sinks in the front right corner you'll
spot a spare M naught to spot compatible
with nvme and sided drives while there's
also a free dim slot yes the air 15 X
comes configured with single channel
memory considering the extra before
you can get with dual channel memory
which I'll go through in a moment I'd
highly recommend grabbing an extra 16
gig stick of ddr4 2666 and slotting it
straight in unfortunately with current
memory prices this could cost you as
much as 200 US dollars and while it's
nice gigabyte leaves a freedom slot for
you to upgrade to 32 gig out of the box
performance is reduced so let's talk
performance we've seen how the kora
78758 performs before in a dual channel
memory configuration in my original
review of that CPU so if you missed it
head back and take a look at all of
those charts particularly if you're
thinking of immediately upgrading your
air 15 X to dual channel memory I also
Chuck the dual channel results in the
upcoming benchmarks for quick and easy
reference he will be focusing on the eye
78758 with single channel memory and how
that differs from the dual channel
results and later we'll discuss gaming
as low memory bandwidth hasn't impact
there as well where the memory bandwidth
has an effect on performance does depend
on the application in Cinebench x264
encoding handbrake and Excel there is a
marginal difference between the Aero 15
X and what we previously established
with the best-case performance for the
chorus of an 87 50h this isn't that
surprising encoding and rendering test
largely don't require high bandwidth and
neither do Excel calculations
decompression also seems largely
unaffected with just a 1% performance
difference in 7-zip though compression
is hit fairly hard dropping by 20 and 23
percent respectively in our 7-zip and
winrar benchmarks that's a pretty
significant difference for just
increasing memory bandwidth so if you
have workloads that are compression
heavy you'll benefit the most from
adding in that second Ram stick Adobe
apps also like additional memory
bandwidth premier encodes at 10% slower
and Photoshop filters like the iris blur
ask 16% slower with just one stick of
RAM that's a considerable difference in
premiere in particular where you might
be waiting a while for an encode to
complete MATLAB is well known to suffer
with low memory bandwidth falling behind
by 19%
across the various PC mark Suites the
aro 15 X was slower than our best-case
eye 78758 results by 2 to 5
and considering the multi workload
nature of PC mark this is a fair result
is some tests are not affected by the
reduced memory bandwidth and others can
be hit a bit harder on average across
all our productivity workloads the
single channel area 15 X is 5 percent
slower than our dual channel cry 78758
configuration essentially that's the
performance you're missing out on by not
having that second stick of RAM inside
the arrow 15 X which is why most
companies tend to opt for dual channel
out of the box in their sort of laptops
it's also the data you'll need when
tossing up between a range of AI 78758
laptops if you can find one that's dual
channel out of the box you can expect 6
percent more performance than the arrow
of course it's also worth comparing the
new eye 78758 arrow 15 X to the older
one with the i7 7700 HQ inside the
original arrow also uses single channel
memory and in workloads that are not
affected by the GPU as our two arrow 15
review systems did have different GPUs
inside we are seeing significant gains
in multi-threaded tests like Cinebench
and video encoding performance is
typically 35 to 55 percent faster with
the new six core CPU and that's a
massive performance job and definitely
gives you a reason to upgrade even if
you're rocking a system from just one
generation ago if you're moving from an
i7 7700 HQ laptop with dual channel
memory performance gains are lower on
average though again a number of typical
productivity workloads are unaffected by
memory bandwidth as for gaming again if
you're interested in a detailed
breakdown of how the error 15x performs
with the i7
8750 h gtx 1070 max Q and dual channel
memory check out my original review of
the ISO 78758 to save rehashing a bunch
of stuff I covered in that review here
I'll just be going through some
performance summaries so you can see how
single channel memory effects results
and how it compares to last gen systems
in general single channel memory does
have a rather significant effect
performance was down in many games by 10
to 15 percent and the biggest losses
were up to a twenty-nine percent drop in
one percent lows a handful of games were
unaffected by the drop in memory
bandwidth but in general you'll find
most games are at least
more susceptible to lowered performance
as I mentioned earlier to get the most
out of the error 15x in gaming you
really want that second stick of ddr4
compared to a last gen system with the
core i7 7700 HQ we previously
established an average performance gain
of around eight to ten percent in games
with the new chorus of an 80 750 H
provided you have dual channel memory
however the error 15x with its single
channel memory struggles to outperform a
dual channel 7700 HQ system on average
there are some games that show roughly a
10 percent performance gain and there
are others that actually show a
performance decline and those are the
games that are most heavily affected by
memory bandwidth interested in storage
performance well my review model came
with a 512 gigabyte Toshiba nvm a PCIe
SSD which is actually a bit slower than
the 512 gigabyte SSD in the original
error that said it still performs well
in sequential workloads and whilst not
as strong as other nvme drives and ran a
performance it should suffice for most
typical workloads plus there is a spare
I'm not to thought if you wanted to
chuck in more storage as just 512
gigabytes can be a bit slim let's wrap
up the round of testing with some
thermal and noise performance after all
we saw the cooler earlier and that thing
is pretty tightening the thermal
performance isn't fantastic but it does
fall within normal results we've seen
from other gaming laptops running the
CPU at 90 degrees and the GPU at 79
degrees during our watchdogs 2 session
however the cooler does run loud which
seems to go against in videos max-q
principles so not sure what's going on
there while quiet at idle the cooler
roars into action during gaming pumping
out 48.8 DBA of noise from 50
centimeters away similar laptops were
reviewed tend to fall more around the 43
DBA range so no doubt the error 15 X has
to push more air across its tiny
heatsink to effectively cool the
components inside oh and battery life
that is probably something I should put
in this review the area 15 X has a
monster 94 watt hour battery which is
larger than most gaming laptops of this
size and class after all the laptop is
positioned for not just gamers but also
those that want to use this laptop for
productivity tasks on the go
looking at the results we are seeing a
notable improvement over the original
era 15 that isn't a surprise considering
the cpu still packs the same TDP I
wouldn't say Bachelor life is fantastic
or as good as top and ultrabooks looking
at these results however it is still
pretty decent for a 15-inch laptop with
powerful internals naturally when
running intensive applications the
high-performance processor will cut your
battery life quite drastically but in
lower power workloads like web browsing
the over 15 X does put up a good show
for the model we tested the error 15 X
comes in at 2299 u.s. dollars and a bit
over 3200 AUD that is a high price to
pay compared to the cheapest gaming
laptops with this hardware inside
however the more portable and compact
you go the higher price you usually have
to pay most of the area 15 X is main
competitors such as the msi ge62 5
stealth thin and the new asus rog
Zephyrus also come in around this price
of very similar specifications I still
quite like many aspects of the Aero 15 X
including its small bezel display the X
right Pantone certification of group
which is you know awesome for creative
professionals and the general compact
portable nature of the chassis not a lot
has changed since the original era 15 in
this regard but minor improvements in a
range of areas is always nice however to
get the most out of the hardware in this
laptop you really need to upgrade it to
dual channel memory it's disappointing
gigabyte didn't include dual channel
memory out of the box I can understand
wanting to make it easy for consumers to
add in more ram with ease but it does
hurt performance in both productivity
workloads and gaming the new 6 core
processor in this laptop is the key
feature and it does provide impressive
performance gains in some tasks but it
is held back a bit by the single channel
memory configuration and still recommend
the error 15x as it has a lot of
strengths and the memory bandwidth issue
is pretty easy to rectify but there is
more intense competition this time
around I'm very curious to see what a
soos and MSI's competing laptops provide
when I check them out in the coming
weeks that's it for this review if you
