calm design your own custom snap backs
and hats welcome back to the hardware
unbox news corner normally we push these
videos out on a Friday but due to a
last-minute schedule change this episode
is reaching you all on Saturday I hope
you don't mind
and hopefully no message news stories
break between when I filmed this episode
and it goes live
fingers crossed about that one also it's
super cold and windy here so hopefully
none of that gets too annoying in the
audio for this episode anyway this week
hasn't been particularly busy with new
stories but there's a few interesting
things to discuss and video were briefly
able to restock their GeForce graphics
cards at the MSRP reports suggest Intel
have suspended production of the h3 10
chipset valve has a steam link app for
mobile devices in the works and more so
let's get right into it the first story
of the week involves Nvidia and this
time it's actually not about the GeForce
partner program it seems the company
wants to get back on the good side of
gamers after canceling the notorious GPP
last week and there's no better way to
do that than to release stock of GeForce
graphics cards at the MSRP the stock hit
invidious official online store on May
9th and depending on the region sold out
pretty quickly as you'd expect in North
America it appeared cards were still
available half a day after the news
broke on invidious twitter however a day
later and a lot of cards have sold out
as of the time I filmed this news
episode every card Nvidia sold through
the website is not available from the
GTX 1080 Ti through to the GTX 1066
gigabyte it's worth noting that as in
video were selling these cards directly
they were only offering their founders
additional versions which launched at a
higher price point than the official
MSRP that explains why some cars like
the gtx 1066 gigabyte were available for
$2.99
rather than the mythical two $49 MSRP
other cards like the GT x 1080 TI and
gtx 1070 TI were priced at the MSRP as
their founders edition price was no
different the MSRP those that were able
to get a 1080
TI from nvidia were the luckiest as in
video was selling them for $6.99 while
the cheapest cards at retailers like
Newegg currently cost $200 more than
that
the gtx 1070 TI and gtx 1070 were also
about $50 cheaper than most cards
available at third parties however due
to the higher than MSRP launch price of
the GTX 1080 and GTX 1066 gigabyte
founders editions you weren't getting as
much of a saving buying directly through
Nvidia as opposed to a third party
retailer selling non-reference cards at
an inflated price even with invidious
latest round of stock the GTX 1080 1070
and 1062 lat the MSRP for a very long
time I'm not sure releasing a handful of
graphics cards that quickly sell out
will make gamers completely forget about
the GPP but that does seem to be
invidious aim here as this restocking
did occur less than a week after the GPP
was cancelled unfortunately it's no
longer possible to get most of the cards
at or near the MSRP though so invidious
goodwill initiative was a bit
short-lived maybe if we go back to
criticizing your video for the G ppthe I
have no choice but to release more GPUs
in the MSRP we couldn't hurt right with
that said there has been a general trend
of graphics cards getting cheaper and
even now many retailers have
non-reference models in stock at prices
that match or come reasonably close to
what nvidia was offering for a few
models we're not back to the MSRP just
yet but we're getting there and it's
worth looking around to see if you can
grab a nice deal and hopefully third
parties can keep their pricing in check
for now let's move on to the other news
stories of the week according to a video
preview from PC world the hotly
anticipated 4k 144 Hertz HDR g-sync
monitors from ASA and a soos will be
available in just two weeks nvidia did
originally say these monitors were on
track for an april launch a couple of
months ago but that clearly didn't
happen so maybe this latest tidbit from
pc world's pointing to a may release is
closer to the money my contacts at
eights arena suits are still suggesting
a June watch for these monitors so
that's not quite in line with what PC
world is saying both ASA and soos have
been firm with their June launch window
for a few months now in fact they were
even saying that
the time Nvidia announced an April
release the whole release of these
monitors has been a disaster let's not
forget they were first shown off at
Computex 2016 and it's taken nearly two
years for launch plans to develop I'm
still not convinced that they will come
out in two weeks or even June like I've
heard but at least the noise is growing
and as for pricing it still seems we're
looking in the 2,000 to 3,000 US dollar
range so they're definitely not a
monitor that everyone will be able to
afford according to a report in the
unreliable digi times Intel have
suspended production of their
entry-level h3 10 chipsets apparently
there is a shortage of capacity at the
14 nanometer fabs used for producing
these chipsets so the first model to get
cut is h3 10 Intel will continue to
produce the rest of the 300 series
lineup including h3 70 B 360 q 360 and q
370 so at least it's only h3 10 that's
affected due to the problem motherboard
manufacturers have been forced to use B
360 for their bottom and motherboards
instead which is a more expensive
chipset apparently supply of h3 10 will
resume in July at the latest considering
the way 300 series motherboards are
priced at the moment we probably
wouldn't have recommended h3 10 boards
for PC builders anyway but it will hurt
Oh II M's that like to use the cheapest
possible motherboards in their pre-built
systems
here's another rumor mill story that
appeared this week according to Chinese
site X preview Nvidia is preparing a
three gigabyte variant of the geforce
gtx 1050 if this card does exist it
would sit between the current two gig
model of the gtx 1050 and the 4 gigabyte
gtx 1050 TI there also packs of course
more CUDA cores there's no firm word on
specifications though it's likely the
three gig model would feature the same
640 cuda cores as the two gig model just
with more gddr5 of course and possibly a
cut-down memory interface from 128 bits
to 96 bits is also possible this GPU
will only be for the Chinese market
again it's a very early rumour so let's
see what happens there this story
interested me a fair bit this week valve
has announced a free steam link app for
Android and iOS devices that will be
released in the week of May 21st
the
we'll allow you to stream games from
your gaming PC over your home network to
a mobile device running iOS or Android
your PC still runs the games but then it
captures essentially a video stream of
the game and sends that service team
link app which in turn sends back
control inputs to the PC valve first use
the technology for PC to PC streaming
and then released a standalone device
called the steam link that you could
hook up to a display for in-home
streaming at a much cheaper price point
seriously you could grab a steam link
for practically nothing most of the time
these days now you'll be able to do
everything the steam link box does with
an Android or iOS device for free which
is pretty neat the steam link app will
support Bluetooth game controllers
including the steam controller so you
won't need to bother with awful
touchscreen controls and provided you
have a good home network setup with
strong Wi-Fi you'll hardly notice the
added latency if you want to do a bit of
gaming on your couch or on the toilet in
other gaming related news a ton of new
games were accidentally outed on the
Walmart Canada website it potentially
has spoiled some of the announcements we
can expect at e3 next month or it could
just be a big bunch of garbage the games
all appeared as placeholders on the
Walmart website and some of which we've
heard of before including Super Smash
Brothers force which the division to
Beyond Good and Evil 2 and The Last of
Us two others haven't been announced yet
these include Just Cause for Borderlands
three rage - Gears of War 5 a new
Assassin's Creed game Lego DC villains
and new splinter cell game and forza
horizons 5 that last one seems incorrect
as the preview forts a horizon game was
fought so horizon 3 in any case that's a
bunch of new games we might be hearing a
lot more about next month at e3
samsung's new 970 pro and 970 Evo SSDs
have hit stores at lower prices than
their original launch prices in some
cases the savings are quite large the
one terabyte 970 Pro for example is a
hundred and thirty dollars cheaper than
the original price which is a decent 21%
saving the basic 250 gig 960 Evo gets
the smallest cut at just ten dollars but
the entire lineup has received at least
some form of cut that's pretty great
news if you're planning on buying one of
these brand new draw
and it brings the pricing more in line
with what we expect considering the
performance that's it for this week's
news corner next week we should be back
to our usual time on Friday so subscribe
