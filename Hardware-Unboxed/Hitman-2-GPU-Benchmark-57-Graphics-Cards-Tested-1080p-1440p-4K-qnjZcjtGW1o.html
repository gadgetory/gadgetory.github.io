something different
we'll be going over some benchmark data
quite a bit of it in fact this time
we're checking out hitman two and what a
better way to evaluate this new title
and throw 57 graphics cards at it I
guess 60 as a more round number probably
would have sounded better now that I
think about it hmm maybe we can aim for
60 next time as long as it's not an
Origin title with that five Hardware
limit change thing per account within 24
hours I think we can make it happen
anyway we still have a truckload of
results to go over but before we do just
a few quick notes about the game
benchmark pass and then of course the
test system hardware configuration I
have to admit I've never really played
any of the hitman titles sadly I just
don't have that much time to play games
and when I do it always seems to be
multiplayer titles with mates so yeah
not a lot of time invested in
single-player titles that being the case
I might actually get to play the 2018
version hitman 2 as it does support
multiplayer I know nothing about the new
multiplayer mode as I'm yet to actually
try it out but a quick Google search
tells me that it is a cooperative
multiplayer mode and it's been titled
sniper assassin and in this mode players
a tasked with eliminating targets using
a sniper rifle within a set time limit
so sounds like it could be quite a bit
of fun now like hitman hitman 2 still
uses the glacier game engine though with
some graphical improvements namely to
the lighting and reflections that said
right now there is no direct x12 support
which is extremely odd given that the
previous version supported this API
hitman was released in 2016 at the time
and the DirectX 12 performance was
pretty janky and therefore we stuck to
DX 11 however it eventually got ironed
out and became our preferred API for
testing I recently demonstrated
performance gains for Vegas 64 using
DirectX 12 with a core i7 87 are okay
and you can expect even stronger gains
with a lower end CPU so the missing dx12
supporting hitman 2 is very unexpected
and right now I'm unsure as to whether
or not support will be added via a patch
or if it's been scrapped altogether
along with the missing API the graphical
options for hitman 2 are extremely
limited when compared to the previous
version for example it's no longer
possible to select the anti-aliasing
method you'd like to use instead you're
forced to use SMA a which I guess is
fine as we used to test with SMA anyway
for testing I'm using the Miami mission
titled the finish line and my save game
location starts us off at the MPC heavy
grandstand for the tests I walk the
entire length of the grandstand then
exit to the right and then take another
right and then the test finish is
basically there it's a 60 second test in
total and the results you're about to
see are all based on an average of three
runs testing takes place at 30 P 1440p
and 4k using the ultra quality preset
that is a bonus we have 18 older
graphics cards very old graphics cards
along with a few newer models tested at
1080p using the medium quality settings
for this benchmark I'm using my core i7
8700 GPU test rig which is built inside
the corsair crystal 570 X and Pack 16
gigabytes of vengence ddr4 3400 memory
for the GeForce GPU is the 4 1694 driver
has been used and for the Radeon GPUs
the adrenaline 18-point 11.1 driver ok
so I think that's pretty much everything
let's get into the results
first off let's look at the older Radeon
300 mg force 900 series graphics cards
starting with the 1080p data as you can
see hitman 2 is very taxing with the
ultra quality settings enabled and for
60 FPS on average you will require
either a Radeon r9 390 or GeForce GTX
970 graphics card the GTX 970 hangs in
there very well if the r9 390 though the
gtx 960 does get a bit trashed by the r9
380 we also see the fury acts doing
surprisingly well as it wasn't that far
behind the gtx 980ti
upping the resolution or 1440p and here
we find it much more difficult to hit 60
FPS on average in fact only the gtx
980ti
and titan x achieved the desired 60 FPS
the game was playable on the GTX 970 r9
390 and anything above those two but
probably not ideal frame rates for the
multiplayer portion of the game
unsurprisingly given what we saw at
1440p the 4
resolution is completely off the table
for these previous generation GPUs
unless you enjoy that cinematic console
like 30fps experience actually scrap
that it's no longer console like let's
go with retracing like from now on now
for the current generation GPUs and I am
loosely defining current generation here
as technically Pascal is a previous
generation part now at least the GTX
1080 and 1080 Ti anyway here we see for
an average of 60 fps you need only the
RX 5 70 or 3 gigabyte GTX 1060 both did
extremely well in our test at 1080p
beyond the rx 580 the new rx 590 and the
6 gigabyte GTX 1060 you're looking at
frame rates mostly above 100 FPS now
jumping up to 1440p here I've dropped
any graphics cards that struggled to
deliver just over 20 fps on average you
could also ignore the GTX 1050 - i RX
560 and gtx 1050 as those graphics cards
didn't really provide playable
performance for 60fps on average you'll
require a gtx 1070 or Vega 56 graphics
card that said these 6 gigabyte gtx 1060
RX 5 80 / 590 we're also able to deliver
playable performance then at the top end
we're still quite heavily CPU bound and
this is why the RX 20 80 TI is barely
any faster than the 20 80 and not much
fast in the GTX 10 80 TI then finally at
4k the r-tx 20 80 TI comes into its own
as it often does and provides an
unrivaled experience we do rip on the RT
x-series quite a lot because of poor
pricing poor DX our performance so far
and a few other issues that have popped
up since release such as cards dying and
stuff like that
but all that mess aside the 20 80 TI
really is an impressive product when
looking purely at 4k gaming performance
never dipping below 60fps with an
average of 85 fps really is incredible I
probably doesn't justify the price tag
at least for most but it is incredible
all the same still the GTX 1080 I did
break the 60fps barrier at 4k and you
can even make do with Vegas 64
here's all the 1080p data for the
current and previous generation GPUs and
apologies to mobile users I'll create a
stretched-out version of this graph and
I'll supply it for free on our patreon
page if you're interested I won't go
over all the data again you can make
your own comparisons here I'll just note
that when using the ultra quality
settings at 1080p we were seeing up to
three and a half gigabytes of vram
allocated on the GPU with eight
gigabytes or more memory so ideally you
will want a 4 gigabyte VM buffer for
playing at 1080p using these quality
settings then at 1440p we saw up to
three point eight gigabytes of vram
allocated so again you want at least a 4
gigabyte vm buffer for this resolution
slightly less GPUs shown here is the
lower models can't handle the 1440p
resolution then at fall can't we have
just 16 survivors though half a dozen of
them didn't really survive that well and
are probably unusable here for gaming at
4k vm usage is almost irrelevant as any
GPU powerful enough and will have enough
memory that said we saw memory
allocation hit four and a half gigabytes
so again given that all GPUs capable of
gaming at this resolution have at least
eight gigabytes of this requirement
isn't really an issue then finally we
have the 1080p medium quality results
with SSAO or screen space ambient
occlusion disabled this will add the RX
570 GTX 970 r9 390 and r9 292 or
pump-out well over 60 fps for around 40
fps on average something like the GTX
950 will do and that actually match the
older flagship GTX 680 you'll notice
older radeon gpus like the HD 7950 do
much better than the gtx 680 in fact the
7970 smashed the GTX 680 by a whopping
20% margin I can already hear the AMD
fans gargling their fine wine in the
comments section below
other popular old bangers take the gtx
750ti for example that was also less
impressive than the AMD equivalents
rendering just 32 FPS on average
anyway plenty of old graphics cards to
check out so feel free to pause the
video here and take it all in well there
you have it in
performance hitman 2 is very similar to
the 2016 version apart from a few minor
graphical upgrades that I mentioned
earlier the games are very alike for
such a CPU intensive game and I will be
providing some CPU benchmark results
down the track it's very surprising to
see the low-level API DirectX 12 missing
and again not sure if support will be
patched in or if developer IO
Interactive just thought it was too much
work to implement though that would seem
quite odd given I thought they got it to
a pretty good place with the 2016
version actually they could have just
continued on from where they are at the
lack of tweakable visual quality
settings is also massively disappointing
for a PC version and it does make it
difficult for those with older graphics
cards to optimize their setup thankfully
dropping down to the medium quality
settings and disabling ssao did improve
performance by around 30 to 40 percent
but still with more quality settings
that would be easier to improve our
performance without sacrificing of
visual quality as much speaking of which
Tim will be providing an optimization
video for this title in a few days
though I have to imagine that will be a
pretty short video as I just mentioned
at some point in the future also get a
hitman two CPU benchmark done I'm still
working on the CPU benchmark for
battlefield 5 using the multiplayer
portion of the game and that is taking a
huge amount of time to get done so I'll
you have that up on the channel sometime
in the future I'm not quite sure when
but yeah I'm working on getting that one
out as soon as I can
so to quickly recap for those of you
wanting to play hitman 2 at 60fps and
all of its glory at 1080p you need
nothing more than the r9 390 gtx 970 RX
570 or 3 gigabyte gtx 1060 and obviously
anything higher up than those cards in
the food chain will be perfectly fine
then at 1440p the gtx 1070 or Vega 56
will be required and again anything
faster them obviously will work just
fine then as usual 4k really is gtx
1080i territory or of course anything
better like the r-tx 2080 TI
finally if you're willing to play with
the medium quality settings at 1080p
then there is a slew of older options to
choose from and that is going to do it
from
me on this one hope you enjoyed the
video it took quite a few days to put
together actually probably twice as long
as I'd normally invest in one of these
videos yeah the game came out I think it
was last Tuesday I've been doing
benchmarking on and off since then
anyway point is a lot of ours was put in
to the creation of this video so I hope
you guys appreciate it the video itself
I don't expect to generate too much
attention hitman 2 is probably not a
hugely popular title so the views on
this one aren't going to be great I knew
that going into it but I also knew there
was quite a few harbour unbox fans that
really wanted to see this benchmark
video made so yeah if that is the case
then please assassinate the like button
or do I want you to assassinate the
dislike button I don't know why I always
go off script and try to be funny and
make something up because it always
backfires and then I confuse myself hmm
anyway I guess you can subscribe for
more content just like this and yeah if
you again if you appreciate the way
we're doing all the hours we put into
this content because Tim and I always
put in a huge amount of time to the
content we make so if you appreciate
that you can support us directly on
patreon and there are quite a few nice
perks if you will like the channel
because you can get access to our
exclusive discord chat where you can
request content which a lot of you seems
to do in the discord chat we greatly
appreciate all your ideas and you'll
also get access to our monthly live
streams we will be doing two of those
next week so a good time to sign up for
patron because you can get in there and
ask questions live have them answered by
Tim and myself we get together and do
that and yeah I think that's about all I
need to say on this one
hope you enjoyed the video I'm your host
Steve see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
