week some interesting news appeared
surrounding Nvidia and the GeForce
partner program it didn't quite make the
cut in time for last week's episode of
news corner but it is a pretty big story
so he felt it kind of deserves its own
separate video and more in-depth
discussion so firstly full credit to
Kyle Bennett from hard
OCP for uncovering this story after a
few weeks of hard work please go and
read his story which talks at length
about everything you need to know plus
of course is always good to support the
original authors of stories like this
anyway this story or perhaps controversy
begins with the NVIDIA GeForce partner
program or GPP for short
the GPP was quietly established by
Nvidia as a new program for establishing
partnerships with OEMs AIB etc to
essentially work close with Nvidia on
new products product launches marketing
and so forth around two weeks ago after
hard OCP began their investigation into
GPP invidious director of partner
marketing John people put up a blog post
outlining the GPP in their words most of
this blog post is pure and video
marketing speak but a couple of lines
are interesting firstly Nvidia claims
the GPP is designed to ensure that
gamers have full transparency into the
GPU platform and software they're being
sold and can confidently select products
that carry the NVIDIA GeForce promise
the blog post continues this
transparency is only possible when
Nvidia brands and partner brands are
consistent so the new program means that
we'll be promoting our GPP partner
brands across the web on social media at
events and more and GPP partners will
get early access to our latest
innovations and work closely with their
engineering team to bring the newest
technologies to gamers partners are
signing up fast they see the benefit of
keeping brands and communication
consistent and transparent the program
isn't exclusive partners continue to
have the ability to sell
and promote products from anyone
partners choose to sign up for the
program and they can stop participating
at any time there's no commitments to
make any monetary payments or product
discounts for being part of the program
so there's a couple of key things to
note here firstly Nvidia mentions
transparency several times but it's not
clear what Nvidia is actually referring
to is it transparency into who Nvidia
partners with for the GPP does the GPP
now provide transparency into the
partnerships Nvidia have held with OEMs
and AI BS for years either way as hard
as you pay points out despite this
transparency it's actually not clear at
all what companies are part of the GPP
the second interesting point is
invidious statement that the GPP isn't
exclusive in fact partners can continue
to sell and promote products from anyone
according to the blogpost and we'll get
into that shortly and this is where the
investigation begins now on the surface
it doesn't sound like there is anything
inherently wrong with the GPP it just
sounds like a typical partnership
arrangement between Nvidia and OMS
delivery of both sides of mutual
benefits like additional marketing and
brand placement but when you look into
the GP P and speak with the companies
involved as Kyle did questions of
anti-competitive and anti consumer
behaviour arise while investigating the
GP p carlton hard OCP spoke with seven
companies none of which wanted to go on
the record however they did speak
anonymously about the GP P and according
to Kyle all the people he spoke to had
similar opinions about the programme
Kyle summarizes the opinions as follows
the terms of the GP p agreement are
potentially illegal the GP P will hurt
consumer choices and the GP P will hurt
a partner's ability to do business with
other companies like AMD and Intel these
opinions stem from a key component of
the GP p agreement document which Carl
read but decided not to publish this
component States that GP p partners must
have their gaming brand aligned
exclusively with GeForce in other words
if a company like a soos wanted to join
the GP p they would not be allowed to
sell
AMD graphics cards in there Republic of
gamers products
no more ROG branded Radeon video cards
and no more ROG laptops with AMD
graphics inside of course it is up to
the partners whether they want to be
part of the GPP and accept these terms
nvidia isn't explicitly forcing anyone
to sign up but there are some pretty
significant consequences of not signing
up specifically the GP p provides
benefits to partners such as launch
partner status high effort engineering
engagements marketing development funds
social media and PR support game
bundling and more and you can start to
see the problem here the GP epi requires
participants to align their gaming
brands explosively with GeForce and if
they don't sign up to the program direct
competitors that are part of the GP P
will get special treatment from Nvidia
so there is a pretty strong incentive
for OMS and AIB s to sign up otherwise
have been left in the dust by the
dominant player in the graphics market
and it allegedly goes beyond the terms
outline in the GP p document some AR B's
expressed concerns that if they do not
sign up to the GP P Nvidia would
restrict GPU allocations and preference
GP p members instead this isn't in the
GP p agreement itself but is allegedly
happening through under the table
agreements there are so many problems
with this GeForce Partner Program it's
hard to know where to begin the biggest
issue is OMS and AIB s are essentially
forced into signing up to remain
competitive among Nvidia partners if
they don't join the GP p there won't get
benefits like marketing development
funds or launch partner status and if a
competitor does join that will receive
an genuine advantage which puts anyone
that decides not to join the GP P in a
difficult and disadvantageous position
and then on top of this Nvidia is
requiring participants to align their
gaming brands with chief force
exclusively so these OMS and AIB
partners that basically have to join the
GP P to remain competitive now cannot
use their gaming brand on AMD Intel or
any other competitors products sure an
ARB partner could technically still sell
an AMD GPU
under a non-gaming brand but the gaming
brands are almost always the biggest and
most attractive to gamers the GPP is
essentially shoving invidious
competitors into less attractive brands
or out of an OEM sport folio entirely
and again it'll be very hard for an OEM
to compete among those in the Nvidia
market without agreeing to do this the
end result is less competition and less
consumer choice and everyday buyer
looking for a graphics card for gaming
would see almost exclusively Nvidia
products from partners that join the GPP
ambi products will be pushed over to one
side and bullied out of the market by an
agreement that OMS and AI BS would find
very difficult not to sign and there's
quite a stark difference between what
nvidia is saying publicly about the GPP
and what the actual document allegedly
states Nvidia claims the program is an
exclusive yet the agreement asks for
exclusivity with the partners main
gaming brand Nvidia claims partners can
stop participating at any time but in
reality if they do they'll be putting
themselves in a disadvantageous position
Nvidia claims the program is about
transparency but no one is saying which
companies are actually part of the GPP
this sort of behavior is a prime
candidate for investigation by
regulators Intel has been stung and
stung hard by regulators in the US and
Europe for anti-competitive conduct and
I think they will find the nvidia
geforce partner program of particular
interest and the whole situation is a
bit puzzling as well Nvidia already
holds a dominant market position with
their GeForce graphics products they are
already the most popular brand among
buyers they're essentially unopposed at
the high end and aspects of their
technology are ahead of their nearest
competitor there is no need to force OMS
into only selling Nvidia products
buyers were already mostly buying in
video stuff anyway and there really
aren't any signs of that changing it's
also a case like with Intel's rise to
power of Nvidia finding themselves in a
dominant position and rather than
investing a ton of money into making
better products they've decided to come
up with ways of crippling their
competition instead and it's not the
first time we've seen these sort of
practices within video game works has
famously been a source of angst among
the gaming community with Nvidia
partnering with game developers to
integrate their effects that mostly
crippled performance on AMD GPUs and
sometimes hurt Nvidia performance -
while providing little visual benefit
hair works for example notoriously
overused tessellation to harm AMD
performance while AMD's competing
technology tress effects actually
provided better performance on both
Nvidia and AMD Hardware tress-fx was an
open technology that didn't really gain
much traction while nvidia signed
partnerships to ensure hair works was
used instead and ambi are clearly
concerned about the GPP as they were the
ones that shopped around this story in
the first place as hard OCP acknowledges
it's always interesting when a company
pitches people like us with negative
stories on competitors it doesn't happen
too often but when it does someone at
the company is usually pretty annoyed
with the practices of their competitor
and these lots of practices end up
holding every consumer in the long run
not just one side or one fan base and
they really have no place in the market
competition is healthy and we're all a
bit sick of companies abusing their
dominant position to further their own
interests rather than using it to create
a vibrant hardware landscape let us know
what you think of the GeForce Partner
Program in the comments below I'm very
interested to hear what you guys think
of invidious dodgy practices to say the
least like subscribe do all that fun
stuff and consider supporting us through
