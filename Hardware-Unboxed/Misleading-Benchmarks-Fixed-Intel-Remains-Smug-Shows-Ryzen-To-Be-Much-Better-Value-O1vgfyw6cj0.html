not gonna drag this one out since other
Steve Steve it came as Nexus already
covered this yesterday so yeah I wasn't
actually gonna make a video about it but
a lot of you did request overnight that
we cover the principle technologies
update and I felt well and it would
probably be pretty poor form not to give
credit where credit is due
so yesterday principle technologies
updated their PC gaming process a study
to include the crater mode results for
the 2700 X as well as the thread Ripper
CPUs though we aren't as interested in
those results I'm not going to give any
backstory here I'm just gonna assume
that at this point you've watched the
previous two videos right so in the last
video I did say I looked forward to
seeing the updated results because
they'd better believe that enabling the
other 50% of the 2,700 X would lead to
significantly different results I
honestly wasn't sure if principled
technologies would update their results
at all and I thought if they were going
to they'd probably wait till around the
time that the independent reviews go
live which will happen and later this
week anyway to their credit they have
rerun the tests and updated their
results still not entirely happy with
the test methods that they use but
really that wasn't might be great with
all of this or sort of just adding
insult to injury or putting a bit of
salt in the wound if you will and my
biggest issue had to do with how Intel
handled all of this and really what they
tried to get away with I might talk a
bit more about Intel at the end of this
video depending on how ranting I'm
feeling but let's just have a look at
the updated results first because that's
ultimately why we're here please note
that they are still placing aimed as
rise in seven processor at a thermal
disadvantage which will shave off a few
frames here and there so it's not a lot
of true apples to apples comparison plus
there's a lot of other issues with the
testing but that's that's one issue the
1900 K results are also mixed from the
previous test they seem of rerun a few
games games like fortnight they probably
had to run and I think there was an
update between the initial testing and
the updated testing so that will usually
break the replay system that means you
have to get another replay and start all
over again so that will change the
results of it there a few other games
already tested that didn't say
to need a retest so yeah a bit strange
and the results moved around a little
bit so bit odd but I don't think there's
anything too crazy going on there they
also updated the details for ashes of
the singularity say they're now using
the crazy preset though the results seem
very similar to what we saw previously
with the high preset so I'm not sure
what's going on there
the 8700 K also appears to be performing
slightly better almost as if MC is
enabled though they say isn't again it's
all a bit odd and I really trust these
results as far as I can throw Tim and
while he isn't a particularly big guy I
still probably can't throw him that far
anyway previously this is what they
found when comparing the upcoming 1900 k
to the 2700 X using the game mode on
average the new Intel CPU was 25% faster
with three instances where it was faster
by a 50% margin or greater
now the updated results using the crater
mode which doesn't disable half the
cause the 9-hour okay is seem to be 17%
faster than the 2,700 X on average you
might think that's not really a big
change but much of a big deal it is just
8% but overall an 8% change across 19
games is quite large and now there isn't
a single title where the 900k beats the
2,700 X by a 50% or greater margin in
fact short of counter-strike a title
that you can play on a Core 2 Duo and we
see less than a 30% performance
advantage going the way of Intel's new 8
core desktop processor so yeah down from
about I think was 56% that's obviously a
significant difference anyway
17% faster on average certainly seems
like a much more realistic figure
certainly based on the testing we've
done previously with the 8700 ok and for
the most part it really was just the
rather odd results in ash to the
singularity war hammer to Gears of War 4
and Assassin's Creed origins that had us
a bit concerned obviously disabling 4 of
that cause in these Corby titles had a
major impact the results do look more
plausible now and while there are still
a number of questionable choices things
look far less absurd and they did
originally later today I'll be releasing
an updated gaming benchmark comparing
the 87 on ok and 2,700 X with the RT X
xx atti
so that will be worth keeping an eye out
for as for Intel well
what can you really say they are
ultimately to blame for all of this and
it appears they still don't get it
well I'm not surprised by that but it's
disappointing to see that they still
don't get it
despite originally claiming that there
was absolutely nothing wrong with the
initial principal technologies
benchmarks and that they were seeing the
exact same numbers in their test labs
well that was obviously complete not a
rubbish you can't say that they both
made the same mistake of course if they
were also deliberately gimping the 2,700
X by disabling half the cause in their
test labs then sure you could argue that
2,700 X was performing within that spec
ignoring all that they went on to say
the following the results continue to
show that the ninth gen Intel Core I
know 9 RK is the world's best gaming
processor like anyone ever questioned
that that would be the case in fact no
one questioned any of the Intel results
it was the ridiculously low 2700 X
results in a number of the tests that
set off alarm bells no one expected the
2700 X to beat or even match the older
87 or okay but it sure as hell isn't 50%
slower in a number of titles then they
wrapped up by saying we always
appreciate feedback from the tech
community are looking forward to
comprehensive third-party reviews coming
out on October 19th how about this Intel
next time you cut the crap and just
leave it up to the comprehensive
third-party reviewers to do their job
seriously if we ever see this pre-order
stunt again with any kind of manipulated
benchmarks from a third party paid sauce
the entire tech press had better come
down an Intel like a ton of bricks I was
seriously disappointed with a few of the
really big media guys in this industry
who either didn't understand what was
going on and didn't bother to take the
time to research this subject properly
or they simply just didn't care I feel
you owe your audience more respect than
that and placing the blame on consumers
who pre-order or don't research
thoroughly enough just it's not good
enough and frankly it's a cop-out if you
don't want he involved in this sort of
thing that's fine don't I can certainly
handle that but if you do want to get
involved and click about your videos
with this issue
don't in any way defend or try to
justify this crap or diminish its
importance because that's not really
helping anyone either research it and
address it properly or just get on with
something else
I don't for a second believe that this
was incompetence or a mistake Intel knew
exactly what they were doing come home
guys let's let's be real about this I've
had gamers Nexus or us here at Harbor
unbox said nothing
I wondered just how many headlines we
would have seen claiming amazing 1900
formance that's up to 50% faster than
horizon fact is guys this thing costs
five hundred and thirty dollars us at
least five hundred thirty dollars us or
eight hundred and sixty Ozzie and that
makes it at least 80% more costly than
the 2700 X in both those regions and
while Petey just told us it's offering
less than 20% more performance in games
so yeah you can kind of see why Intel
went about things the way they did
during the pre-order period finally I am
no AMD fanboy anyone who's watched a
reasonable amount of our content will
know we only look out for the consumer
and whenever one of these big companies
get out of line
well we pull them back into line or at
least we attempt to with the small
amount of influence that we have now
when we review the 1900 K later this
week we will be absolutely no mention of
this debacle we will be reviewing the
product based on its own merits so don't
expect any further bashing over this
mess there so I don't want to see any
real AMD fanboys pretending like we're
sweeping this under the rug we've
covered this it's done any way we can
now fully close the book on this
situation
Intel tried and failed miserably this
time hopefully they won't try again but
well yeah probably don't need to say too
much on that one but if and when they do
we'll be racing game as an access to
smack it down once again hopefully next
time we'll have some seriously big
hitters backing us up you can only hope
