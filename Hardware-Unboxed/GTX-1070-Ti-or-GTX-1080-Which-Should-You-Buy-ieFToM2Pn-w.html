recently compared the gtx 1070 TI on
vega 56 GPUs and 35 games three
resolutions and found that more often
than not the GeForce GPU was faster it
was also offering decent gains over a
factory overclocked GTX 770 and when
overclocked was on par with a factory
overclocked GTX 1080
the MSI gaming X version in this case
they said many of you asking should you
buy a gtx 1070 TI or a gtx 1080
basically you save $50 us by buying the
gtx 1070 TI and if you play an overclock
then you will get GT x 1080 light
performance although we've already seen
how a factory overclocked GTX Terri
stacks up what about one pushed to its
limits or there abouts how much faster
would that 1080 be well I've overclocked
the gaming ex model to find out now we
found previously that overclocked my
particular GTX 1072 it maintains a boost
clock speed of 2000 megahertz and that
is the highest frequency I can achieve
while maintaining stability the GTX 1080
on the other hand was good for 2050
megahertz
this means that the GTX 1080 was at most
clocked two and a half percent faster
which is 5% more crude of course I can't
imagine they'll be that much in it
looking over the comment section of the
gtx 1070 TI vs. vega 56 video most
suggest that the 1080 was a much better
product due to the fact that it takes
the value of gddr5 X memory I found in
the past though when under clocking the
memory on a GTX 1080 that it doesn't
really impact performance that heavily
even with the COS overclocked so the
1080 is not nearly a star for bandwidth
as some would lead you to believe the
GTX 970 I on the other hand is a little
star for bandwidth but overclocked in
the jus ddr5 memory does rectify this
when overclocked I got the gtx 1070 TI
memory of 2252 megahertz while the GTX
1080 ran at 2810 megahertz so that means
the gddr5 memory of the 1070 Ti was good
for a throughput of nine gigabits per
second while the gddr5 bet
the turnout he was pushing eleven point
two gigabits per second previously I
found overclocking the gtx 1070 TI
increased performance by around eleven
percent across the 35 games tested and
that's a pretty decent gain for a Pascal
GPU this meant that while it was
previously just 8% faster on average
when compared to the msi gtx 1070 gaming
ex model that margin grew to a rather
large 20% once overclocked and as I said
earlier this place at on power the GTX
eternity gaming X graphics card so let's
overclock the GTX 1018 know the max and
reevaluate that comparison first up we
have Assassin's Creed origins and for
those of you that plan to overclock the
snot ahead of your graphics card the GTX
1080 will provide just 3% more
performance in this tile that's just 2
FPS as you can see moving along this
time we have destiny - and the
overclocked GTX tennety was just 4%
faster on the overclocked 1070 TI this
again shows how the MSI gaming X model
is just about getting all there is to
get from the 1080 and we have f1 2017
and this time we see you say 2 percent
gain favoring the GTX 1080 though this
overclock does at least put it back
ahead of the 1070 TI
even if it is only by a frame or two
next up we have project cars - and here
we do see I wrapped the decent 6 percent
advantage going away of the GTX 1080
that said though an extra 6 FPS isn't
entirely surprising given that this was
one of the few games where the
overclocked GTX 1072 I couldn't match
the factory overclocked gaming X version
of the 1080 moving on we have quake
champions and here we see a mere 4%
performance advantage for the
overclocked GTX 1080
another 4% jump from the overclocked gtx
1070 TI to the overclocked 1080 can be
seen when testing shadow of I can't say
that word because the video will get D
monetized
then in love hammer to just a single
frame separates for 1080 and 1070 TI
once both are overclocked I'd say a
single frame is within the margin of
error but either way the 1080 was no
more than 2% faster in this title
and finally Wolfenstein - another 1/2
FPS difference for an up to 2% advantage
in the GTX tonight he's favored I'm sure
by now you get the idea so let's wrap
this up
so the GTX 1080 is faster once
overclocked
just not that much faster gddr5 X isn't
really a factor here despite offering
25% greater throughput with the memory
overclocked to the max on both graphics
cards along with those criticals the GTX
1080 was at most 6 percent faster though
realistically he'd probably only be
looking at around 3 percent on average
and remember the 1080 was also clocked
almost three percent higher as well so
if you get a good 1070 TI overclocked
that to the same frequency to run at
about 2050 megahertz as that was the
frequency at my 1080 maintained then
that 3% margin could shrink to just a
percent I'd also say that your odds of
winning that famous silicon lottery
about a rebound is good with either a
1070 TI or a 1018
I certainly don't have any evidence to
suggest otherwise if we look strictly at
the MSRP s and the GT X 1080 costs 11
percent more than the gtx 1070 TI that's
$500 verse four hundred and fifty
dollars u.s. it's not really that much
all of minutes just fifty dollars but
the 1070 TI is a better value option if
you plan to overclock those of you not
keen on overclocking really we'll find a
similar level of value with either GPU
and this is probably true for the gtx
1070 as well the cost per frame would be
much the same between the 1070 at $400
the 1070 TR at 450 dollars and of course
the 1080 at $500 it really is almost as
crazy as Intel skylake X range like for
example do you need a Tenkasi period
$1000 a 12-course if you're $1,200 14
quart 1416 core $1700 or an 18 core at
$2,000 I mean how does someone know if
they need a 12 core or a 14 core CPU and
at what point do you just stop I guess
Intel would say that's it
$2,000 okay so I'm getting a bit
off-topic time to answer the question
which should you buy I guess I probably
put this way I personally like to get
the maximum bang for my buck so I'd get
the gtx 1070 i assuming it's priced at
the MSRP that is and
overclock it to the max to achieve 1080
light performance and be pleased that
I've saved enough money for a nice meal
however if I wasn't into overclocking
and just wanted to get something that's
pretty agile out of the box then I think
I just got a factory overclock 1080i
like the gaming ex model used for the
testing so I hope that helps those of
you trying to work out if you need to
buy a 1070 TI or a 1080 obviously there
really isn't much in it you can't really
go terribly wrong either way just be
aware that if you are after a 1070 - I
to save that $50 or so then / - really
makes sense you do need to overclock
that sucker and that's gonna do it for
this one like subscribe comment and send
me all your money via patron I'm your
host Steve Sagan soon guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
