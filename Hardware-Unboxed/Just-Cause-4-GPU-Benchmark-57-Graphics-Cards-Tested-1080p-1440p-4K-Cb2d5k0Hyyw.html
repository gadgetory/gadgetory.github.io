are benchmarking and just calls for and
we're doing so with a boatload of
different GPUs to help you determine if
your graphics card will be able to
handle this title and if not what a
suitable upgrade option may be for those
of you unaware Just Cause 4 was released
early this month on the 4th and as the
name suggests it is the fourth
installment in the just'cause series
it's also the sequel to 2015 Just Cause
3 the games make use of ever launches
apex game engine though it is a newer
updated version featuring diverse and
extreme weather effects including
blizzards sandstorms tornadoes and more
the game engine also includes improved
physics based rendering along with a new
animation system developer Avalanche
Studios also claims that the game's
artificial intelligence has been
improved over what we've seen in Just
Cause 3 and the intention here is to
make the NPC smarter making them more of
a threat to the player this all sounds
great but unfortunately the game has
been very poorly received and
unsurprisingly it's mostly for the same
old reasons we seem to see with these
triple-a titles that are either rushed
out or whatever basically the user
interface is garbage
the graphics are unimpressive and worst
of all despite the lackluster visuals
that performance is horrible seriously
when a developers and publishers going
to learn this is just getting ridiculous
at this point the game itself while a
little clunky at times seems to be a lot
of fun and although I've only played a
little over an hour now I'm interested
to see more the problem is to enjoy it
I'm using an RT X 20 atti at 1440p and
this is required to maintain above 60
FPS at all times
yeah it's actually that bad if you've
got a GTX 1060 or rx 580 or god forbid
worse well the game is going to leave
you very very annoyed for testing I'm
loading in at the start point at least
for the early stages of the game jumping
into a car then driving off the bridge
not off the side of the bridge like off
the bridge along the road and then to
the jungle the test lasts 60 seconds and
it paints
accurate picture of the kind of
performance you expect to see which as
you're about to see isn't particularly
good I should note that I've played the
game to the point where you call them
reinforcements and then the battling
NPCs do add quite a bit more load on the
system included in the testing are the
1080p 1440p and 4k resolutions along
with just a massive range of graphics
cards I've also got some additional
testing at 1080p with new and old
graphics cards using mid-range quality
settings but please note Tim has a much
more detailed optimization guide coming
within the next few days though given
what I've seen in this video I really
don't envy him for taking on that job
for this benchmark I'm using my updated
GPU test rig which is built inside the
corsair crystal 570 X and comprises of a
core i7 80 similar okay clocked at 5
gigahertz with 16 gigabytes of ddr4
3,500 memory for the GeForce GPU is the
4 17:22 driver was used and for the AMD
radeon gpus adrenaline driver eighteen
point twelve point one point one okay so
I think that's about everything let's
get into the results okay so with all
the graphical quality settings maxed out
the game doesn't look too amazing
and with the GTX 980 you won't even see
60fps on average at 1080p the same is
also true for the fury X those with old
and mid-range graphics cuts such as the
GTX 970 or r9 390 can enjoy frame dips
into the mid 30s and then if you have a
gtx 960 or r9 380 well good luck 1440p
is basically out of the question for
previous generation GPUs the fury x and
gtx 980ti it was struggling with average
frame rates in the mid 40s so yeah
that's a little bit painful not much
more to say here really so I suppose we
should probably just move on to the
current generation GPUs ok so this looks
a little bit better sort of I mean we're
only at 1080p but at least there are a
few more options providing 60fps on
average that said the GTX 1066 gigabyte
and rx 588 gigabyte failed to average
60fps
though the radio and GPU did get pretty
close and we're still higher-end models
such as Vega 64 in the GT x 1080 were
unable to keep framerate
above 60fps and our test so ideally for
that your wanted antiox 27 you're better
for playing at 1080p
it's like DX ours enabled or something
for those playing at 1440p you will
require an RT x 2080 th to maintain over
60 FPS at all times while the 20 AT&amp;amp;T e
TI are only good for around 50 FPS for
the 1% low result and yeah you can't
help but laugh at these figures lower
end models such as the GTX 1016 Eric's
580 are basically a write-off here so
yeah I can't wait to see the 4k results
well this looks pretty much like what
we're expecting given what we saw at
1080p in 1440p the RT x 28 eto is sort
of okay here I mean not great but it is
at least playable it's pretty crazy that
we're seeing Assassin's Creed Odyssey
like performance in a game that looks a
nowhere near as good and let's be honest
Odyssey wasn't exactly the best
optimized game in fact I think most
outlets bashed it for its poor
optimization wrapping things up here are
all the 1080p results thrown into a
single graph it's really no need to go
over these but if you want to examine
them more closely please pause the video
and take a bit of a look at how the
previous and current generation GPU
stack up the same applies at 1440p there
are fewer graphics cards here though as
there weren't that many that could
achieve 30fps on average then for the 4k
results just 10 GPUs could break the
30fps barrier the gtx 1070 did just fall
short but I've included it anyway okay
so the game maxed out is very demanding
but what if we drop the quality settings
down to medium disable SSAO
and change the anti-aliasing method to
FX AAA well doing that boost performance
by around 30% and you guessed it that's
not nearly enough for most of these
older GPUs the much-loved gtx 750ti
averaged just 27 FPS 27 FPS at turning
if he using heavily dialed down quality
settings even the current generation gtx
1050 was pretty horrible
with regular frame dips below 30 FPS
even with these reduced quality settings
the rx 570 r9 390 and GTX 970
couldn't keep frame rates above 60fps at
all times at 1080p finally the GeForce
GTX 580 which we often test with using
these medium type quality settings had
to be dropped from the test as it
suffered massive graphical artifacts in
this title so that's probably going to
be a problem for all GeForce 500 series
graphics cards well I can certainly
understand why gamers are upset in many
ways just cause for seems like a
downgrade from the now three year old
just calls three things such as
character models they're much the same
and animation detail also appears much
the same the real disappointment though
is within the environment some areas do
look a little bit better bit more detail
others don't and while others just
appear far worse take the water effects
for example or rather lack of I mean
seriously this is a waterfall or a
Windows wallpaper
it's almost static and it looks
absolutely terrible I don't know what
they were thinking the water is just so
bad in Just Cause 4 surely this is a
mistake
I mean it really is laughable how bad
the water looks it's even more shocking
because the water in Just Cause 3 was
actually pretty amazing boats created
wakes there were waves ripples when you
walk through it you know actual water
effects even the explosions don't look
as good either in my opinion they lack
the detail of the previous title the
only impressive aspect of this newer
game is the weather system some of the
effects there are quite good so the
downgrade in visuals is bad but what
makes it so much worse is the
performance
I can't directly compare performance
between the 4th and 3rd installments in
the Just Cause series but on average I'd
say you're looking at 40 to 50% better
performance using identical settings in
Just Cause 3 and well it has to be noted
that the previous title wasn't the most
optimized game out there compared to
modern titles you're looking at the same
kind of performance we saw in Assassin's
Creed Odyssey and we bashed that title
for being an optimized and while it
looks much better so just cause for
really is a mess the developer really
has their work cut out if they want to
save this trainwreck of a game again
it's really a shame that the game itself
seems quite decent quite a bit of fun
but it's let down by lackluster visuals
and
absolutely horrible frame rates and the
poor performance isn't down to heavy cpu
or aggressive memory usage either
basically you'll get the same results
with an older quad-core like the 77 or
okay and from what I can tell something
like the rise in seven 2700 X's on par
with the core oh nine ninety nine or
okay that said the game engine is really
starting to show its age is just one to
two threads are heavily loaded with the
rest doing very little work still we
appear to be GPU limited as overclocking
chip such as the 87 or k2 5 gigahertz
C's no real performance gain over the
stock configuration the most part the
games not to memory intensive a
gigabytes of system memory will do and
the demand on via rams not that higher
that you're looking at about four and a
half gigabytes of vram required for 4k
gaming about three and a half gigabytes
at 1440p and then around three two maybe
three point three gigabytes at 1080p so
nothing too extreme there and we have
seen much higher demands with newer
titles such as shadow of the Tomb Raider
for example overall though I think I
would avoid this title and fans of the
series really need to pray that
Avalanche Studios work on some sort of
patch fast whether that's to improve
performance improved visuals or if we
can dream a little bit visuals and
performance that would certainly be very
nice anyway on that note I think I'm
going to end this one make sure you keep
an eye out for Tim's optimization guide
I know I'm certainly very interested to
see what Tim comes up with there because
as you saw dropping things down to
medium and changing a few things like
ssao and the anti-aliasing method didn't
really help improve things tim says he
has a few tricks up his sleeve so yeah
