another episode of unboxing boxes with
Matt we are now up to episode 8 I guess
time flies when you're having fun
unboxing boxes today I'm going to hack
away these things with a ridiculously
stupid device pizza cutter let's get
into it disbursed box is from someone
and it's a DHL box and this is pretty
hopeless come hand off this thing I
don't think my hand was in danger gotta
back up in here I've got a couple of
sets of budget eshe headphones so these
are fighting car and they say they are
high-end any monitors designed by tinker
so the t100 I believe you can grab them
on Amazon so I pop these opening love a
bit of a look you fancy-looking box put
some instructions
actually come with a little carry case
which is pretty nice inside there is I
guess they took over your ears it's
actually a little cleaning device she's
pretty cool those waxy ears a bunch of
different silicon caps airplane adapter
one of the big sat in the death just to
so pretty premium package recipes let's
check out their headphones themselves
very bright transparent red and not sure
how these going to look when they're on
which slides which how's that look
look big earring let's check out other
sound they're definitely loud yeah they
seem pretty decent I have to check
pricing but i believe that are pretty
affordable interested to see the footage
to see how they look at my years though
it's a pretty bright red all right
what's next this time the man koshin
each pro gaming headset so interesting
brand for our chinese and these look
like some of those cheapo Said's
headphones popping open up a look at
some instructions yes an adapter to that
tiny little connector know what you use
that for piggyback of wool rca's an
extension between a half mil cable so
got this big adapter so you can plug it
into so you can music with an Xbox or
Playstation you flick a switch to switch
between them and switch the mic on and
off and then you can also change the
volume on your microphone and on this
week's on the headphones themselves and
get USB and three and a half mil they're
pretty light pretty big and chunky no
swivel little comfy
yeah not the most comfortable baring one
don't really seem to sit on my ears
properly but all right we'll fold down
my you can see how these same as well
not a lot of bass but sound pretty clear
I really got to check with some flac
files and so you guys can hear a few
selves right now you know exactly how
the sound all right next little package
so this came literally like this I can
see what it is but I'll open it up now
I'll show you guys boot pc Roger cable
might believe that seal it up thanks
Jeremy again thermaltake this will come
in handy Roddy this little white package
under this one's from China as well
we got there so you guys might have seen
mighty 77 doesn't know is that 77 review
probably about a month ago it's a budget
mechanical keyboard from a company
called Bette Grande vella and there was
actually quite impressed with it but I
wanted to see if you know if their
products were consistent if they'd
hand-picked my line perhaps so I got
another one in that's what it looks like
for those of you didn't remember so it's
the one that has a lot of the rainbow
not RGB is with different colored
backlighting for each row now they use
blue switches that are very similar to
the cherry MX blues these actually look
slightly different grab the other one
and just check it out so they look
identical the switches are actually
slightly different so the switches on
these look exactly like the cherries
there's the switches on these ice little
slide bits on them I think they're
actually a bit quieter
so grab the other box and it appears to
be the same product said 77 I can't
really read Chinese so that's kind of
limiting me right now but anyone can
read Chinese what are those White's you
can say let me know aside from that
though honestly sucking on them feels
the same I'm not sure what that's about
I'll try and find out I got one more box
which I've been hiding behind here
because I've got another brand that's
not respecting the surprise factor of
the unboxing boxes with mac series so I
just sort of tuck it away back here but
let me pull it out got a power cord and
here we've got the key nap TS 451 a
there you go white and green for bein
asks that comes with full gear am I
think it's a budget or mid-range home
Nast and it can also be used as a home
theater PC we've got HDMI on the back
and a whole ton of connectivity USB 3 on
the front one of those weird little
double connectors samsung used on like
one phone I'm a card reader plenty of
connectivity and you guys can expect a
full review of that one soon so that
pretty much wraps up probably the
messiest edition of unboxing boxes with
Matt and I promise not to try and use
this thing again all right i'll see you
