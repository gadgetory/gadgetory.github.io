release I took in videos new mid-range
Pasco based GPU along with AMD's rx 480
and compared them head-to-head on six
year old systems these pcs were powered
by Intel's Core i5 750 the name DS
phenom ii x4 955 if you haven't seen
that video i recommend checking it out
but in short it looks like you're going
to see similar performance margins
between the RX 480 and gtx 1060 on older
hardware
we also found gamers are going to see
considerably greater performance when
using modern processors with his new
mid-range GPUs many of you who watch
that video requested further testing
with Intel Sandy Bridge and AMD FX
processors while I'd very much like to
accommodate you all given the time it
takes to reduce just one of these
benchmark videos it's unfortunately not
possible that said I spent another two
days of solid benchmarking to thoroughly
compare these new GPUs on the AMD FX
platform the FX 8350 was used for
testing in both its out-of-the-box
configuration as well as overclocked
included purely for comparison is my
standard GPU test ring as I already have
the results for both GPUs in the system
this is an overclocked PC so I'm trying
not to make it a direct comparison but
rather show how fast these mid-range
GPUs are we're not hampered by a system
bottleneck the results are again very
interesting so let's get into it in
total 24 games were tested at two
resolutions and as always results based
on an average of three runs that means
at least 576 benchmark runs were made on
the FX 8350 to get a drink and something
to eat
this is gonna be a long one first up we
have ARMA 3 and right away at 1080p
you'll notice a shocking decline in
performance for the FX 8350 when
compared to the 6700 K this CPU
bottleneck does reduce the performance
margin between the arcs 480 and gtx 1060
from 31 percent down to 17 percent in
favor of the green team increasing the
resolution to 1440p drastically reduces
the impact of the CPU bottleneck and now
the FX 8350 is just a few frames slower
than the 6700 K with both graphics cards
ashes of the singularity has some
interesting results for us the RX 480
delivers the same performance using the
FX 8350 as it does the 67
using directx12 while there was a sharp
decline in performance when using
DirectX 11 the GTX 1060 also sees the
same large drop in performance using
DirectX 11 and while performance also
drops using DirectX 12 the impact is
lessened moving to 1440p we see similar
performance trends when playing ashes of
the singularity of 1080p the batman
arkham knight results are also very
interesting and rather unexpected using
the FX 8350 we see that both graphics
cards are noticeably slower at 1080p
however the average frame rate of the
gtx 1060 is higher though oddly the
minimum frame rate is much lower the RX
480 sees virtually no change in minimum
frame rate from the 6700 K while the
1060 s is 16% decline moving to 1440p
neutralizes the results and we see
similar trends used in the FX 8350 as we
did with the 6700 K our battlefield 4
test primarily tests GPU performance and
therefore the FX 8350 is really no
slower than the 6700 K here the same is
true of 1440p though it is interesting
to note that the are exported delivered
the exact same performance on both
processors while the GTX 1060 was
slightly slower with the FX 8350 Star
Wars Battlefront is another game where
our test is primarily GPU dependent now
such even at 1080p both these GPUs
deliver similar performance on the FX
and i7 processors this is of course also
the case of 1440p and again it's great
to see the our X 480 provided the same
results on both platforms once again in
an unexpected twist it's the gtx 1060
the drops performance on the slower FX
8350 processor while the our X 480
delivers the same 95 FPS average in 83
FPS minimum even a 1440p in black ops 3
the 1060 was slower with the FX 8350
while the RX 4 ID provided the exact
same performance crysis 3 is another
heavily GPU dependent game at least this
section we test is and as a result the
FX 8350 6700 k results are much the same
with both GPUs as expected we find much
the same a 1440p dirt rally provides
more than a few surprises at 1080p
firstly there's a huge performance
discrepancy between the FX 8350 and 6700
k the gtx 1060 was 21% slower on the
overclocked FX 8350 while the RX for ad
was 36% slower more crucially where the
RX 4 ad was previously just 15% slower
than 1060 it's now 32 percent slower
with the
8350 so this is the first game where we
see the RX for 80 perform much worse
than the 10 60 on the slower FX
processor as we've seen previously
increasing the resolution to 1440p
heavily reduces the performance margin
between the 6700 K and the FX 8350 and
CPU dependent games the RX 480 and GTX
1060 are now separated by a similar
margin on both processors doom is yet
another game that throws up some very
interesting results
notice how the RX for 80 dominates when
running on vulcan with the 6700 K moving
to the FX 8350 seems to completely
eliminate the performance advantage
whereas the RX for 80 was previously 36%
faster it's now just 8% faster on the
overclocked FX and 5% faster without
overclocking meanwhile we'll see the
complete opposite with the GTX 1060
which is now faster than the RX 40 using
Volcom with the FX processor whereas it
was previously just 3% faster on the
6700 K we now see a much more
substantial 20% performance gain moving
to 1440p completely changes what was
seen at 1080p the RX 480 is now able to
comfortably beat the gtx 1060 with
either processor and huge gains using
volc√°n can now be seen on the FX 8350
meanwhile very little in the way of
extra performance can be seen when using
the GTX 1016 f1 2015 isn't a hugely CPU
demanding game though the in-game
benchmark does feature a full grid of AI
controlled cars so that no doubt sucks
up a few system resources here we see
the performance trends on the FX 8350 is
similar to the 6700 KF of both GPUs at
1080p moving to 1440p we find it's only
the GTX 1060 the drops and performance
though to be fair it wasn't CPU limited
on the 6700 K in any case the 1060 and
480 delivered the exact same performance
on the FX 8350 in f1 2015 fallout 4 is a
super CPU intensive game mostly due to
poor optimization but that's another
story
anyway here we see a rather large
decline of performance from the 6700 K
to the FX 8350 for both cheaper used
there having said that it's the RX for a
DS minimum frame rate that's hit the
hardest
moving to 1440p completely eliminates
the performance variances seen at 1080p
and both GPUs performed as you'd expect
them to using a high end processor grand
theft auto 5 saw a massive decline in
performance when going from the 6700 K
to the FX 8350 both the RX 480 and gtx
1060 suffered similar performance hits
however once again
increasing the resolution to 1440p
eliminated the performance hit when
using the FX 8350 for both graphics
cards using DirectX 12 near the GPU took
much in the way of a performance hit
with the FX 8350 though it was a very
different story with DirectX 11 now at
1440p we see virtually the same
performance when using DirectX 12 on
both processors Just Cause 3 is
relatively heavy on the CPU so will
decline in performance with the FX 8350
was expected the impact wasn't that
significant and both GPUs suffered a
similar performance loss moving to 1440p
almost eliminated any performance hit
the Rx for ad talk when using the FX
8350 the GTX 1060 didn't fare too poorly
either though it did suffer a slightly
larger performance drop and moving to
the AMD processor Mad Max isn't it all
CPU dependent and well the results
support that claim given what we saw at
1080p the 1440p results are also as
expected Mirror's Edge is another game
is primarily GPU dependent and as a
result the RX 480 and GTX 1060 aren't
much slower when paired with the AMD FX
processor the performance trends are
much the same at 1440p again both GPUs
delivered similar performance with the
FX 8350 overwatch it does a good job of
utilizing a fair number of CPU cores so
despite benchmarking with two teams full
of a are controlled BOTS the FX 8350
does rather well
here we see virtually no difference
between the 6700 K and FX 8350 with
either of the GPUs naturally given what
we're seeing at 1080p we also find no
difference in performance of 1440p Far
Cry primal is another game is
predominantly GPU bound and therefore
the FX 8350 is able to provide similar
performance stat of the 6700 K with
these GPUs the same is of course true at
1440p where we see virtually no
difference in performance between these
two systems rainbow succeeds is another
GPU bound game and therefore the RX 480
in gtx 1060 perform much the same using
the FX 8350 system as they did with the
6700 k system oddly at 1440p the minimum
frame rate of the gtx 1060 was much
lower than we were expecting on the FX
8350 system so i'm not sure what was
going on there the Middle Earth shadow
of mordor benchmark isn't particularly
CPU demanding so as expected both GPUs
provided similar performance on the FX
system this is also the case of 1440p as
we see almost identical performance on
both systems the benchmarking tom
clancy's the division
focuses heavily on GPU performance and
therefore we once again see similar
results on both systems as we've seen
time and time again in GPU bound games
and even some CPU bound games testing at
1440p created GPU bottleneck testing
rise of the Tomb Raider at 1080p sees
the rx 480 in GTX 1060 deliver similar
performance on the FX 8350 system though
as was the case on the 6700 K system the
480 delivers much lower minimums oddly
at 1440p the GTX 1060 is able to
outperform the R X 480 on both the 6700
K and FX 8350 systems given the 1080p
results this is very unexpected for now
I've only tested the total world
Warhammer using DirectX 11 and as a
result the GTX 1060 does have an
advantage on both systems the GTX 1060 s
advantage remains a 1440p though it
fares even better on the FX system
finally we have the Witcher 3 and if
you've made it this far good for you it
must have been a slow day anyway at
1080p we find similar performance on the
FX 8350 system with both the GTX 1068
and IR X 480 when compared to the 6700 K
machine the same is true for the 1440p
results both cards were just a few
frames slower when compared to the 6700
K results so as found previously when
using much older Intel and AMD
processors the RX priority makes out
just as well as the GTX 1060 on less
powerful processors shall we say if you
were to cherry-pick the results you
could argue either is better but looking
at all 24 games we find what is very
much of back and forth fight on the FX
8350 system speaking of the FX system we
found that a 1080p didn't look great in
relation to the overclocked 6700 K in a
number of games however in most of those
titles moving to 1440p eliminated the FX
bottleneck and allow for i7 like
performance this means budget games has
still been looked after reasonably well
by the FX series though these processes
should be avoided by high refresh rate
gamers although I do typically recommend
budget gamers avoid the power-hungry FX
series in favor of the much more
efficient four threaded core i3
processors I can see why so many still
prefer AMD's affordable 8 core
processors the worst examples of poor FX
performance can be seen in arma 3
dirt rally f1 2015 fallout 4 grand theft
auto 5 and Just Cause 3 that's their
bumping the resolution up to 1440 PE
clothes
up the performance gap to almost nothing
in most of these games with this new
mid-range GPUs meanwhile the other 18
games play just as well on the FX 8350
rig as they did with the overclocked
6700 K so to summarize the last 2009
words that AMD FX 8350 will do just fine
with the are exploratory in GT f2 1060
especially if you plan to gamer 1440p
