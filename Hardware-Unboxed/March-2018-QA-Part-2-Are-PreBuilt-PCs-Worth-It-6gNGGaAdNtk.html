for part two of our march QA we went a
bit over time on the first one so we've
decided to split it up and have another
go at it so hope you guys enjoy all
right this is from youtube do you think
5.25 inch drive bays are dead or will
they make a comeback I would say they're
dead as a doorknob just way too big and
nothing of usefulness nothing usually
takes advantage of them so yeah gone
they're not making a comeback anytime
soon
next question from YouTube which
unboxing knife did you give to Tim for
really context here for those of you
that don't watch unboxing boxes shame on
you I got a new knife so I had a crappy
one and now I've got that beast for
unboxing boxes I wasn't hit my fingers
away from that one I think definitely
and we got a second knife they were both
provided by Ted who's a viewer the
second knife I was going to give to Tim
and I still plan to but it turns out
that's a flick knife and they are
illegal here in Australia but you can't
have this spring removed from them to
legalize them so I'm setting that off to
a specialist because it's quite a
difficult to take high quality knife so
they're hopefully gonna be I take that
apart remove the spring and then Tim
won't get locked up for possessing it so
that's that's done anyway and if that
fails and we can't get the spring
removed then our friends over at sky
soldier blade said they will hook us up
with another knife that's legal so
bloody legends those guys yeah thanks to
you all for educating us in the comments
a bit about B we gather these knives you
not knife and stuff yeah so it turns out
we were wrong in not legal so from
YouTube again how did Hardware unboxed
what was the idea behind it so I think
that question is probably how did Harbor
on Box start oh yeah okay so we've
explained this a once or twice or three
times
for but I'll sort of quickly cover it
again the idea of this channel is you
guys know Matt was the face of it
originally I started it with Matt and
Matt's idea was because I get lots of
hardware for the job I do a tech spot
covering and reviewing computer hardware
was to unbox that stuff on the channel
do that make a video out of that and
then go and do the technical review so
we did one or two of those and they
turned out they were really boring and
we didn't even enjoy making them or
watching them back so we thought well
this isn't going to work and the natural
progression seem to be just pivoting
into an extreme benchmarking channel so
however I boxed well yeah we never
changed the name so yeah but in keeping
with our heritage I unbox a heap of
boxes that I collect and we do that once
every week or two and unboxing boxes so
the names still makes sense all right
this next question is from YouTube is it
safe to assume Intel will not make
future cpus compatible with its z 370
platform you know let you answer this
one there's a few to use Intel's
motherboards given their recent track
record of releasing three different
platforms in almost one yeah thank you
for the hard work plus the hours you put
into these videos thank you very much
yeah thanks as far as Intel's support
for future platforms and existing
motherboards yeah probably not gonna
happen is it pretty much a guarantee I
don't think that yeah I Intel don't like
to support either forward or backwards
compatibility with their motherboards at
this point yeah I don't think we're
gonna see anything change there unless
Verizon gets extremely well not
competitive it already is competitive
but takes an obvious lead you know then
they might sort of change strategy a bit
there but yeah I can't say anything
changing anytime soon
so Adam on YouTube asks are you a
motorsport fan Steve what do you drive
well yeah I do enjoy motorsport quite a
bit I generally tune in for every f1
race I don't like to miss any of those
as for what I Drive not f1 car is it no
definitely not a fun car these days I
just drive a Volkswagen Passat
it's the diesel model because you know
mileage and all that but my first car
was an R 33 I've talked about on the
channel before in these Q&amp;amp;A things it
was pre I imported it from Japan myself
way back in the early 20s I had it for
about seven years and I did track it for
the last few years like it was fairly
heavily modified so it went really well
it was a Pathan so from YouTube had a
lot of questions from YouTube so far
yeah sorry about that
why can't my Rison 1200 using a h1 15 I
can't do 4 gigahertz at one point 4
volts ok well it could just be that it's
a bad ship and even if you were an
expert overclocker it just won't do it
or it could be your motherboard slash
file settings I see a lot of people
complaining about this and I've found
that most chips will do you know at
least 3.9 most of mine do do 4 gigahertz
with just under one point 4 volts I
found the key is increasing the load
line calibration that really helps
stabilize that overclock so if you're
having some trouble there check your
load line calibration see what that's
set to because you might be suffering
voltage drop under load
so yeah look into that this next
question is again from YouTube is it
worth getting a prebuilt in 2018 yes we
see heaps of people talking about this
and it really depends on the people that
you're talking about most of the
examples out there you know pretty much
junk you really wouldn't want to touch
it with a 20 foot pole if it's a
prebuilt it's really cheap you know it's
probably for a reason so you really need
to look out there for you know the OEMs
that give you actually good motherboards
yes chips and power supplies and all
that sort of things so keep that in mind
but I think you know the high-end gaming
pre-built tend to be pretty decent but
it just the cheaper ones got a yeah
really watch out for I just say it
really depends on who is supplying them
as well yeah next question is from
youtube and it is addressed to Tim and I
but I think Tim will probably be more
equipped to handle this one than I am I
wanted your opinion on the KB like G
CPUs and how many companies do you think
will actually use them since the 7700
hq+ the 1060 or 1050 to I combos already
exist and are much cheaper
they're supposed pricing only one I've
ever heard about is the XPS 15 two in
one thanks and keep up the great content
thank you yes I'll answer that last part
first so there is the XPS 15 two in one
that's going to be using cable 8g
there's also an HP Spectre x-360 15 inch
and I am and the Nook as well of course
which is not really a laptop but until
will be selling those and I presume
Apple as well has a bit of interest in
these sort of chips knowing that they
often do Intel CMU and AMD graphics in
their laptops I haven't heard about too
much other interest but that's where it
kind of stands for at least the launch
timeframe and I think partner there will
be some interest in and outside that but
there's plenty of reasons to use it the
first one is that you know board space
is really limited in these platforms and
cooling space as well you know if you
have a discrete GPU and the CPU you need
more board space you need a second fan
often for the discrete GPU to be cool
and all that sort of thing so you know
company's gonna use it to save some of
that yeah
and assuming performance is around the
level of a ten sixty which is worth sort
of looking like I in terms of GPU you
know that will help bring better
performance to thinner laptops which I
think you know we haven't seen too many
of the fifteen inches user ten sixty
that aren't gaming laptops that are a
bit thicker whereas you know the Dell
and HP model should be really thin and
light so there's plenty of reasons why
companies would use it and hopefully
we'll you know with the reduce space
we'll get better battery life in this
system so it will be a win for a lot of
people but I think you know it'll be for
high-end products with that pricing
difference yes plenty of possibilities
there so I'm sure there'll be plenty of
companies wanting to take advantage of
it yeah so this is from a Twitter will
you do a specter slash meltdown retest
now that we've had time for the updates
to be rolled out and finalized mmm yeah
okay I guess it depends on how much
demand we've got but at this point I'm
thinking probably not I'll just run
benchmarks with everything up-to-date
and present those results and we'll just
move forward from there but there's
probably room for some sort of look back
type video in the not-too-distant future
next month we busy though so we'll see
this next question comes from Twitter
how much hardware have you unboxed well
not enough now that I have my new knife
so from Twitter do you guys think RAM
prices will ever go down well ever yeah
Co makes it easy to answer yeah I'd say
100% they will go down and my crystal
ball though it's giving me some
conflicting data at this point if I had
to guess though I'd say pricing will
start to really tumble next year at
least by next year at the latest but of
course don't hold me to that as I said
my crystal ball isn't working at the
moment but hopefully that gives you a
rough idea ok this next question is from
Twitter do you think there is a perfect
laptop in terms of price performance
design etc yeah probably not in terms of
finding a perfect laptop you know a lot
of laptops have at least some sort of
you know small nitpick problem what you
want as well yeah and it does depend
what you want you know a lot of laptops
I really like I really like the razor
blade stealth no XPS 13 those sort of
laptop so there are some really good
options at the high-end burn terms like
the perfect system for price performance
and everything yeah I think companies
are still working to try find that yeah
definitely
alright Steve check out this question
from Twitter what's it like being a good
source of benchmarks and things like
that ah that's nice
well good sure
seriously though yeah we work hard to
deliver the best content we can so yeah
it's great to have an audience though
that appreciates the work we put into
the videos and because of that I'd say
it really feels like actual work yeah so
this question is also from Twitter
will you give far cry 5 the honor of
your legendary benchmark treatment you
know it I've pre-ordered it and I've
already started warming up the test
system so we're good to go
there's questions from Twitter since
getting those knives do you still have
all your fingers intact yeah we're good
this next question is from Twitter
do you guys actually play the games or
just use them for benchmarking Tim this
is the second time someone has talked
about playing games instead of just
benchmarking them what what is this all
about what are you guys talking about
playing games this one is from Twitter
do you expect to see widespread USB C
and USB 3.1 gen2 front panel connectors
anytime soon are we gonna stay in this
Wow two USB 3.0 that's good
fell for a while funny question but I
would expect this to become a standard
feature at least for higher-end cases
the courser it's not actually behind me
it's normally be home ec forget about
that because they have 500 D that I
recently checked out did have front USB
type-c and 3.1 gen2 connectivity on the
front panel so I think we will start to
see a lot more of that
so from Twitter again do you think we
are going to see more TI models in the
2000 series TI models for our for the
next generation probably only if AMD
turn up the heat and force them to cover
more price ranges and not I'm not ruling
that out for the next generation parts
so they all probably think I'm a bit
crazy but we'll see what happens
alright this next question comes from
Twitter specifically for Tim she so
that's your surname yep that's that's
the correct way yep I got a name right
that's yeah with the razor phone having
a 120 Hertz screen do you think the next
big trend for smartphones are high
refresh rate displays yeah I really hope
so because we've seen that in PCs and
it's awesome and hopefully that comes to
a few more phones but unfortunately a
lot of the releases I've seen so far
you know from rumors and also you know
having devices I've got a Galaxy S 9
here for example there bog-standard 60
Hertz so I think it's going to depend a
lot on things like battery life and
performance which obviously need to be
better for 120 Hertz
you know the display type and that sort
of thing so hopefully we see more but I
reckon a lot of phones will still be
unfortunately still see
he hurts all right well I'm gonna say
nothing because that was specifically
just for Tim so yeah moving on
well that does it for marches QA again
thank you to everyone who asked a
question yeah all right I put my phone
do not disturb mode C's yes it's easiest
laughs and that finally brings us to the
end of the March QA thanks Jared who
asked question we had a lots of
questions to get through and that's why
we ended up splitting into two parts but
I hope you guys enjoyed watching it and
we'll catch you again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
