another episode of unboxing boxes I've
taken a break from testing a thread
Ripper it's been a long couple of days
now on on the grind testing that I
thought be nice to take a break and have
a look at some of the boxes they've been
piling up at my front door and see
what's inside I am expecting an x 399
motherboard from as arakan this pile
also boards from MSI and gigabyte coming
but they're probably not arriving till
tomorrow so hopefully we get to have a
look at 1u x 399 board and a couple of
other cool things so I'll start with
this little box here because I think I
know what this is and I'll get this out
of the way yes this is why I thought it
was is a core i7 7800 X and I actually
purchased this myself with my own money
so this is a retail chip not a qsr
sample because so far I've got a couple
of these all my core X CPUs rqs samples
from Intel and I thought well I would
like to test a retail chip instead so I
went and purchased this it was 560
Australian dollars they are quite pricey
at the moment selling for over the MSRP
about 450 US you can expect to pay for
one of these six core processors now
this is the i7 700 XO it is the six core
12 thread mold the reason I bought this
because some of you guys know I did do a
30 game comparison with this and the
Rison v 1600 all up-to-date all latest
numbers and yet a few people were
shocked upset by the results after MIT I
was very surprised by the results I
didn't expect to Rison to be as
competitive as it was with this chip and
yeah there's been a few theories as to
why that was some of them are true some
of them are just angry fanboys but one
was that the QA samples aren't as good
as the retail ships that some people
have started testing with so I really
don't think that's the case but I can't
rule it out either till I try one so I
thought well I'm going to spend five
hundred and something dollars get one of
these and see if the retail chips are
any better so I will be testing that
next week see if the numbers differ in
any way from the Q s sample in until
so now I have spoke to Intel about this
I asked them if they could get me a
retail chip and they refused to so I've
just gone and bought one and they say
that the QA samples performing exactly
like the retail chips so I would
probably agree with that I'd say they're
right but you know can't take them at
their word so bought it more test it out
I'm on that note with that video some
people pointed out which was true I was
using higher latency memory on the Intel
platform opposed to rise themselves
using cell 14 with Rison and cell 16
within town that does hurt Intel's
performance a little bit we're only
talking a couple of frames here I've
already done a bit of retesting with
cell 14 on there with the x78 chip and
it was like it was always at least one
to two frames improved so that will give
it a percent or so over the horizon five
I think at most I saw maybe four frames
but we're talking above well over 60 fps
you saw the margins are huge so it does
does improve performance with the
tighter
timings but yeah nothing significantly
it wasn't heavily handicapped in the
original benchmarks and finally I just I
find it all a bit a little bit silly
like I want to make sure I'm giving you
guys accurate information so I do take
the benchmarking very seriously which is
why I've spent quite a bit of money on
the seuss motherboard and now the
process I spent over $1,000 to ensure
that my numbers are accurate by changing
the motherboard and the CPU and you know
we'll be looking into that further but
at the same time they're not going to be
significantly download the asrock boards
not going to be that much worse and
people like Tom Tyler have already
tested the asrock seuss and MSI boards
and found them all to be much of a
muchness in games there's a little
variance here in there but overall much
of a muchness and you're not going to
see all of a sudden this is 40% faster
and it's smoking the r5 6100 that's just
absolute Fantasyland stuff for Intel
fanboys is not going to happen and with
this chip price almost 100 percent more
and that nothing in fact you're in the
platform costs which are significantly
expensive compared to something like a
be 350 board it there's no way you can
justify buying this if you want to do a
bit of productivity stuff bit of
encouraging rendering what-have-you and
a bit of gaming the r5 1600 is
hands down the better value proposition
there and I review everything based on
its value
anyway I'll move on from that because
I'll just keep ranting and ranting and
we want to do a bit of unboxing I won't
bother taking the chip out you guys have
seen those before
you know all about them so let's move on
next up I think we should probably try
and find that X 399 motherboard it's
definitely not going to be either of
those yes it is this one I'll just rip
the shipping label off yes that's what
we have in here is a you come on okay so
as Rach have said this isn't the full
retail package which is quite obvious by
looking at the black box so there are
some things missing like the i/o shield
and stuff like that and that's quite
normal when you get an early sample and
when I do build videos and I don't
install the i/o shield tons of guys in
the comments freaked out about it and I
forget to put a text overlay saying I
don't have the i/o shield
anyway if I do a build video there is
the i/o shield in this one so that was
all a bit redundant but anyway sometimes
sometimes you don't get the full retail
package but it looks like I've got all
the bits this time here we go something
really interesting about all the X 399
boards I've seen so far opposed to the X
299 boards the Intel versions is that
the vrm heat sinks are massive on the x3
nine boards but they've done a really
good job of that plenty of power input
and stuff like that so that again
suggests that the x-29 stuff was heavily
rushed so on this board it looks like we
have an 11 stays vrm again massive heat
sinks over it so it looks like a really
nice set up on this board should allow
us to get some decent overclocks out of
our thread Ripper parry cab just popped
it out of the foam taking the cable ties
off there we go
look at on the back of the board it's
quite interesting there are a lot of
capacitors on the back of this board a
lot more than you usually see
and then you're on the front side like I
said that 11 phase vrm we also have a
heap of SATA ports significantly more
rather than so significantly more more
than we saw on their Seuss board a few
days ago so eight in total we've still
got the u dot two and on board it looks
like we have three ultra M two ports so
heaps of expansion air for your storage
and we have four PCI Express x 16 slots
and it looks like the primary and I
suppose would be the secondary it's the
technically the third slot they're both
so those two there are both wired for 16
x so the full pcie 3.0 bandwidth and
then those two are wired for 8 x so only
half the length of the slot has pins so
yeah so you've got two sixteen and two
eights
that's how they're hardwired I've just
done a quick count and it looks like you
have a dozen or you can have up to a
dozen USB 3 ports with what's on the i/o
panel and the onboard headers so that is
a heap of USB 3 action you obviously
have 802 11 AC Wi-Fi and it looks like a
pair of intel Gigabit Ethernet
controllers or yeah gigabit ethernet
ports and it's kind of cool on that note
they've put rising thread Ripper on this
plastic sort of i/o cover rather than
the usual Intel Ethernet stuff usually
on here all the ram.4 motherboards from
Azeroth you have a big Intel logo here
and yeah that sort of annoyed a few
people having that there so they've
changed that to rise and thread Ripper
now which is looks really cool and yet
it's a bit better than having a big
Intel logo Intel is probably paying them
to do that
so I'm not sure how the deals changed or
whatever but anyway it now says rise on
thread Ripper which looks really cool I
know you guys probably don't care about
sound too much but it is an important
aspect of the motherboard and we do have
purity sound for on this board and
that's using the realtek ALC 12:20 audio
codec and that's quite good you've got
some audio caps for that and it's on an
isolated section of a PCB so that should
be a decent audio solution there and
then you're getting back to the power
delivery we have an 8
the power input here with a four pins
it's good to see that we do have it
would be nice to have two eight pins but
a and for sure to get the job done
the yeah that's a very quick look at the
board I'll probably do some kind of
build with this board because yeah it is
a really really cool looking extra known
board and like the asou support I looked
at a few days ago it's very weighty
these X 399 boards are very heavy indeed
decent slab of aluminium on there for
the heatsink but yeah just serious
amount of components big heavy socket
that's probably a lot of weight just in
that tr4 socket yes there you go
hopefully you guys have seen some cool
b-roll of it that I've been throwing up
impressive looking boards they're from
as rock alright next up let's take a
look at this one and some of you will
have spotted it looks very much keyboard
shaped suspiciously like a keyboard this
one okay well that's what we're faced
with what okay here we go there's a
label here okay this is the motor speed
CK 888 888 okay that doesn't tell me
much let's have a look inside okay so
it's a mechanical keyboard and mouse
combo alright so I just went and checked
and this was sent to me by banggood
online retailer I believe in China at
that wrong but yeah they've set this
over this is a an affordable mouse and
keyboard combo that they sell and you
cool it that's very smooth that Mouse
and you probably wondering how
affordable well for a mouse and keyboard
combo especially mechanical keyboard was
what seems like a good quality Mouse
it's very affordable
$57 eos that works out to be about 74
dollars Australian so for a mechanical
keyboard with a mouse that is extremely
affordable we've seen a couple of $50.00
$40.00 mechanical keyboards but they
have it included a mouse so we've got
some nice big wide feet there with
rubber pad that sits on the desk with a
lot of grip the mouse is uh extremely
smooth
way that glides it feels great and those
clickers feel very solid and they give a
nice tactile feed back looks like we've
got four buttons so the mouse wheel is
quite a nice wide creepy mouse wheel
that is a clickable looks like we've got
a DTI shift button here or adjust button
and then to right click or buttons on
the right side of the mouse that you can
access with your thumb like a so but it
looks like we have an optical sensor for
this Mouse not quite sure on the
specification there but you can shift
between 800 dpi a thousand dpi 1600 dpi
and 2400 dpi yes so that's pretty cool
it is an RGB Mouse as well so you can
see there's a couple of translucent
strips pretty much all around the whole
Mouse so it should light up quite a bit
an alum probably things and b-roll that
already and then the keyboard itself so
the font looks pretty much it's that
kind of uglisha font that every single
sheet keyboard has so it'll be very
similar to the ones we've seen already
but they look it's obviously cherry and
blue knock off switches so they're not
genuine cherry blues but they do sound
and do sound quite good I'd say there's
a slight bit of variance in how the key
sound but they all feel feel very good I
mean for the money
mechanical keyboard I'd say this is
about as good as it gets
but I'll plug that in give it a go it is
RGB backlit as well I'm not quite sure
on the controls and stuff but I'll put
some b-roll up of the effects and stuff
when I try that out after the unboxing -
104 key design there - millisecond
response actuation on the keys what else
I would say if this is anything like all
the cheap affordable mechanical
keyboards I've seen so far come out of
China there won't be any software or
anything like that it'll just be a
function key and then a combination of
buttons to change lighting modes and
stuff like that yeah I'd say that's the
case
anyway a cool-looking keyboard very
affordable I'll give my thoughts on how
it works in the description or in the
comments down below let's get this our
biggest heavy box out of the way I
thought this might have actually been
the X 399 motherboard but it wasn't so
we'll see or at least we don't know what
this is yet but it wasn't that board
because that board was in another box
this could be another x-ray on our
motherboard it isn't it definitely isn't
it's a heap of UPS bags like just just a
whole heap of them that's all it is is
just ups on our hang on there is
something else in here it's not just UPS
bag this is probably why it was so heavy
there is AC Sonic focus plus gold power
supply and it looks like it is the 650
FX version believe that 650 watt and it
is fully modular based on what is on the
box let's take a look and check her out
so we've got a couple of temporary sort
of velcro a cable ties we have some VIP
ties and a couple of black screws and we
also have what looks like a seaside
sticker all right
power supply itself comes in your
typical nice little bag take that off
and smell that new power supply smell a
little toxic it's actually a pretty
cool-looking past-life extremely short
for a 650 watt looks like that would
have to be a 14 centimeter model that
one probably says somewhere I'll check
that in a minute be a very compact it
looks like we've got a nice 120
millimeter fan on the top there a cool
little logo in the center come on this
is when you need nails did it there we
go
it's nice and shiny has cool little sort
of painted design on here looks pretty
impressive from all angles got another
bit of a plastic appeal here that'll be
what you'll see from the back of your
computer case where you plug the power
that's a cool little are sort of
certified sticker there
speaking of certified this is a gold
certified 650 watt power supply and I
believe there's a 550 watt or 750 watt
and perhaps even an 850 watt model and
yeah as the Box said it is 100% modular
and we'll have a look at the cables in a
second so yeah some of the highlights it
is 14 centimetres deep or 140
millimeters so very compact for 650 watt
unit especially of these are
specifications like I said it is gold
certified 650 watt output for this
particular model fully modular and as a
fluid ball bearing fan it also has a
hybrid sort of sleep mode silent control
thing where until it reaches a certain
temperature the fan doesn't turn on and
probably the highlight for this see
sonic unit is the fact that it comes
with a 10 year warranty so that's pretty
exceptional especially given that it's
not it's not outrageously priced it's
105 US and that it actually isn't
selling in Australia at the moment so I
don't know what the Australian price
would be or if it even coming to
Australia be one hundred and five US
dollars for this particular model and
with a 10 year warranty
that's pretty exceptional the cables are
in a another cool little bag pretty
typical so we've got a power cord here
this is looks like a u.s. Power Core so
that's no good to me and we have two
different styles of sleeved / rubberized
table to wear on the Left go on
I need my knife you can stop looking I
found it that much that must sound great
okay so the more serious cables like
your 24 pin ATX power cable your PCIe
cables for your graphics cards and then
the 8 pin PSU cable so there's no it's
only a 650 watt version so you won't get
an 8 pin plus another 8 pin or a 4 pin
you'd have to go higher wattage for that
be at 8 p.m. plus your 24 pin and then
you have a pair of PCI Express
connectors for your graphics card looks
like you can you've got there all 6/8
pins they can do either six or eight and
each cable has two connectors so you
could run the SLI or crossfire cards off
this power supply assuming they didn't
draw more than what it can deliver now
the peripheral so your solder on your
4-pin molex cables you have one 4-pin
molex cable that has three connectors on
it you also have the old floppy drive
adapter kurz fan controllers and things
like that still use those and then it
looks like you've got each cable has
four they both the same yes for solder
or SATA powered type the seven pin power
connector soft oh so that's quite a bit
of power there and they obviously plug
in here and it's all pretty standard
power supplies kind of stuff but yeah
really good quality power supply their
amazing warranty yeah I like that a lot
seems like the price is very reasonable
as well I'd like to see what the 750 and
if there's an 850 watt version as well
what they retail for but as usual I'll
through the links in the video
description so you can check it out for
yourself but that is a highly rated
passable I know for a fact that things
like the voltage regulation is excellent
the AC ripple and noise suppression it's
also excellent and yeah as you can see
by the 80 plus gold certified it is a
very good power supply in terms of
efficiency as well so overall really
good value by there alright last but not
least we have a package wrapped in a
black garbage bag so let's open that up
and see what it's all about so as you
can see this is a Radeon rx 560 from
gigabyte and if you recall I actually
unboxing this very product not that long
ago on the channel well when I say this
a very product it was a gigabyte rx 560
gaming AC model except it wasn't the 2
gigabyte model which I recommend you
guys buy it was the 4 gigabyte model the
reason I recommended the 2 gigabyte
model was because typically speaking the
our X 560 doesn't really require 4
gigabytes but yeah that's that's what
I've sort of I'm going off past
experiences there I haven't done any
updated testing with new games at
turning pair using realistic settings to
see if you can actually take advantage
of that if the higher textures and
things like that games do make a
difference it's not going to impact
performance so they will perform exactly
the same but you may be able to use
higher textures and things with the 4
gigabyte version which may improve well
should improve image quality if that's
true or not but I wanted to get my hands
on the 2 gigabyte version to compare
with the 4 gigabyte version I'm not just
going to do the usual performance
comparison using sort of medium quality
settings I want to establish sort of a
baseline and then see if you can crank
things like textures up on the 4
gigabyte car without impacting
performance and what it does the visual
quality so there'll be screenshots and
game footage and stuff like that so that
should be an interesting comparison and
we'll sort of hopefully be able to
settle on the 2 gigabyte vs. 4 gear bite
thing so lower end cards once and for
all
so yeah that'll be an interesting video
seems like a heap of time and that'll be
a few weeks down the road from now via
keenya keen to give that a go you guys
have seen this card so I won't bother
taking it out of the box I might drop
some b-roll of it out of the box a bit
later on so you will have seen that
already yeah that is an important
graphics card for that testing that I
want to do so that pretty much concludes
this episode we've got to look at a very
cool x3 99 motherboard from Azeroth
which I'll be plugging in probably
tonight and testing that one out see how
that goes
very cool power supply here which I will
be featuring in a build
I already note to be a good unit but I
would like to test it out for myself and
see how it does but I'm sure it will
work well and then the budget keyboard
and mouse combo from the Bangu retailer
so I'll throw a link to that in the
video description so you can go over to
their website and check that out but
yeah really affordable and it should
work very well for the money and then
I've got my processor so I've got a lot
of testing to do but you'll be doing a
heap of testing with that to see if
there's any difference to try
in the qsr samples and the retail chips
and yeah that pretty much concludes this
rushed episode well I took a quick brief
pause from the thread River benchmarking
which I'm about to jump straight back
into and yeah you'll see that video on
Thursday night it'll be quite late 11:00
p.m. my time here in Victoria Australia
so yeah Thursday night all the thread
reference stuff will be done the video
is going to be quite lengthy there's
I've done a heap of testing mainly
focused on productivity stuff and a
little bit of gaming in there they are
mostly productivity and a few other
things but yeah very interesting overall
can't wait to show you guys that so
that's going to do it for me on this one
I hope you guys enjoyed this quick
rushed random unboxing I'm your host
