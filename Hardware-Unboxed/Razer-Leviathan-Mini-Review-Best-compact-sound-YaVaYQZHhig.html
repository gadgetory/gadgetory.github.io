unboxed and today i'm going to be taking
you on a tour a raiders leviathan mini
portable bluetooth speaker better known
for their PC gaming peripherals and
laptops ready to have a few speaker
solutions one of which is a sound bar
and subwoofer combination called the
Leviathan a combo that's been quite
popular with critics and consumers the
Leviathan mini is the portable little
brother to this speaker said and it's a
single piece small sized unit that will
slide into any backpack and to be honest
most people's pockets it measures just
185 millimeters long 54 millimeters deep
and 55 millimeters high for an overall
size that was a little smaller than I
was expecting
in no way is the unit heavy but it's
five hundred and 38 grams make the
compact device feel solid in your hand
the shape and design of the mini are
very similar to the full-sized Leviathan
just smaller black speaker grilles cover
the front and the back of the device and
the body is encased in a strong black
plastic shroud tucked away at the side
are two buttons one for power that
lights up green and the other for
bluetooth pairing which lights up blue I
was pleased to see dedicated buttons for
both next to these buttons are two ports
one for a three-and-a-half millimeter
auxiliary input and the other is a
standard microUSB charging cable up top
of the remaining buttons on the speaker
of which there are three plus and minus
shape so they're for volume up and down
and in between is a circular shaped
button that can be used to play and
pause tracks pair the speaker with
another Leviathan mini for stereo sound
or answer and hang up phone calls
the bottom of the speaker features a
rectangle of rubber that insulates the
speaker from the surface of rests on
preventing vibrations and most unwanted
sliding around when connected to your
smart phone you can also take calls
through the speaker the built-in mic is
on top of the Leviathan mini and as long
as you're happy with everyone in the
room hearing your conversation it's
great as long as you're fairly close to
the device in terms of sound performance
the Leviathan mini was extremely
impressive
I think the surprising weight of the
speaker is probably down to a the build
quality but also what must be
high-quality magnets used in the
speakers because this thing pumps out
some seriously great sound firstly the
volume is outstanding and I noticed very
little distortion of higher volumes
nor did I notice a lot of sound
processing to achieve this it's plain
and simply a high quality speaker
driving this sounded to front-facing 45
millimeters
and a passive radiator at the back of
the speaker what surprised and impressed
me most about speakers sound was low-end
not because it was better than the mids
which are the real highlight of the
speaker's sound but because you don't
expect to get such good low-end from a
small speaker for me this is a real
strength and Leviathan mini when
compared to other similarly sized
portable options the battery in the
speaker is an exceptional it's powered
by a 2600 milliamp hour battery that you
can expect to last you an 8 to 10 hours
of playback nothing exceptional here but
I strongly doubt raised it could have
fitted anything much bigger in this very
small package overall I really really
like what the Leviathan many offers it's
a really cool looking speaker that's
more sleep than flashy and feels and
looks like the high quality sound that
it produces remember that's not a
waterproof or rugged speaker so if
you're looking for something to take to
the beach or mountain bike riding it
might not be what you're looking for but
for use anywhere that's relatively safe
this speaker was simply not disappoint
in Australia the Leviathan mini can be
had for as little as 220 dollars on eBay
while in the US you can grab one from
Amazon for 155 what do you guys think a
little via the mini let me know in the
comments use the Amazon shopping links
in the description and I'll see you guys
