benchmark video for this one we're
winding the clock all the way back to
2015 well sort of by that I mean we'll
be benchmarking in videos 2015 a
flagship part the geforce gtx 980ti
but we'll be doing so with games
released in 2017 pretty crazy with the
recent arrival of games such as project
cars to total war Warhammer to destiny
to Wolfenstein to Star Wars Battlefront
- hmm that's a lot of second
installments anyway with all those games
plus quite a few more you guys have been
asking me to retest the gtx 980ti
I guess the reason why you guys have
been asking for a retest is because you
want enough it's still going strong or
has it just rolled over and kept lit
itself since I recently tested the fury
X along with the gtx 1070 to iron all of
these tiles I thought why not add the
gtx 980ti as well on hand for testing i
only have the reference model gtx 980ti
but that's probably okay as the fury x
exclusively used aim DS reference design
and didn't come fax your overclocked
that said I'm not going to waste time
overclocking the fury X because I know
it to be a terrible overclocker
previously when testing a massive range
of games we saw at most maybe a 5
percent boost from overclocking the fury
X meanwhile the GTX 980 I saw gains of
up to 30 percent when overclocked
by default the 980ti runs at a base
clock of 1 gigahertz with a maximum
boost clock of 1.2 gigahertz and a
memory speed of 1.75 gigahertz overclock
though I was able to push the core up to
a base speed of 1.25 gigahertz which
resulted in a boost clock speed of at
least one point four eight gigahertz the
gddr5 memory also reached two gigahertz
for a transfer rate of eight gigabits
per second so that's a 25% overclock for
the cause and a 14% bruise for the
memory so stock and overclocked how's
the gtx 980ti
get on in today's games let's go find
out shall we the only thing demonetised
faster than a youtube video these days
is the loop box in star wars battlefront
2 though like a youtube video after a
quick review pros
it will likely be reinstated dodgy
in-game currency nonsense aside
battlefront 2 looks pretty incredible so
you might expect it to be extremely
demanding that said they like the
previous version it's very well
optimized and here we see the old
geforce gtx 980ti spitting out over 60
FPS at all times using the ultra quality
preset at 1440p an average of 73 FPS
placed it ahead of the fury x but 5 FPS
behind the gtx 1070 of course
overclocking the gtx 980ti
unleashes a great deal of previously
untapped performance and now able to
beat a factory overclocked two gtx 1070
to match vega 56 as well as a stock gtx
1070 TI that's a seriously impressive
result that means that the overclocked
980 TI was just 8% slower than an
overclocked gtx 1080 and 11% slower than
vega 64 next up we have Assassin's Creed
origins a game that sits on the complete
opposite end of the optimized spectrum
to that of battlefront - even though
this game is horrible in terms of
optimization the geforce gtx 980ti does
worse than expected it has to be said at
least in relation to the gtx 1070 that
said overclocked it's not a great deal
slower and it was able to close in on
vega 56 i guess the key thing to note
here is the fact that the 980 TI was 32%
fast and the furious before any
overclocking even took place since I
last benchmarked a heap of GPUs in
destiny - Nvidia has released a new
driver offering incredible gains in this
tile anywhere from 30 to a 45 percent
boost in performance for the GeForce 10
series GPUs that said these
optimizations have clearly been applied
to the Maxwell series as well here we
can see the stock gtx 980ti almost
matching the gtx 1070 a very impressive
result indeed
then once overclocked performance was
improved by a further 20% now we're
seeing vega 64 liquid-type performance
from in videos 2015 flagship part
impressive stuff and it meant that the
gtx 980ti was now just 9 percent slower
than the gtx 1080 and overclocked 1080
nonetheless this is a truly impressive
result from the 980 and it also meant
that it was almost 50% faster than the
fury X overclocked in the gtx 980ti from
the stock reference spec led to a
massive gain if
2017 the jump from 75 FPS on average to
98 FPS is a whopping 31 percent increase
the gtx 980ti
already had the fury x beat by a
convincing margin but once overclocked
it was on a completely different level
as now faster than vega 56 unable to
match the gtx 1070 TI moreover it was
just 13% slower than an overclocked gtx
1080
here we have another game where again at
the stock clock speeds the gtx 980ti
doesn't look that impressive and really
struggles in project curls to only
matching a gtx 1060 once overclocked it
catches up to vega 56 though it still
trails the gtx 1070 by a small margin
this is one of the worst results we've
seen for the old gtx 980ti
and even so it's still very impressive
considering its age moving up we have
quake champions and while not the most
demanding title to be released in 2017
you do want high frame rates for optimal
gameplay and this is what the gtx 980ti
delivers while the fury ax drops down to
around 80 FPS the gtx 980ti is good for
over 90 FPS at all times and once I have
a clocked never dip below 110 FPS in
fact overclocked it not only beats the
stock gtx 1070 TI but it also matched a
Vega 64 and that's not the first time
we've seen that so again another very
impressive result moving on we have
Middle Earth shadow of war and the
Maxwell base gtx 980 i've struggled in
this title out of the box that was quite
a bit slower than the gtx 1070 at least
when comparing the average frame rate
and this meant it also trailed the fury
x overclocked just edges ahead of the
fury x and it isn't much slower than the
gtx 1070 TI so overall not a bad result
once overclocked total war Warhammer 2
is extremely demanding at 1440p using
the ultra quality preset for testing
I've used the battle benchmark and
manually require performance of the
DirectX 12 API stock the 980ti sits
between the fury ax and gtx 1070 once
overclocked though it is able to match
vega 56 and the gtx 1070 Ti so once
again the 980 TI proves itself to be
extremely capable even in today's games
wrapping up the test in May of
Wolfenstein two the new Colossus and I'm
wondering if the gtx 980ti
is like
a bit of Driver optimization for this
one as it is quite a bit slow in the GTX
1070 as a result can only match the RX
580 though this is a Vulcan based tile
and is preferred by AMD hardware anyway
once overclocked the gtx 980ti gets back
in the game and now can be found
alongside the gtx 1070 TI so overall not
a bad result so has the geforce gtx
980ti
Kepler itself now not by the looks of it
it's clearly still a very capable
graphics card and this is why many that
bought it back in 2015 haven't bothered
upgrading to a gtx 1070 or even a 1080
and the recent arrival of the 1070 i
certainly won't tempt them either it has
to be said that so far the gtx 980ti
looks to be aging considerably better
than the fury acts and that's probably
down the fact that it has a bit more via
Ram to play with if you're willing to
tone down a few settings and the few
reacts could probably be brought back
into play so it's probably not as bad as
it looks in some of the tests shown here
if you're willing to relax a few of the
more memory hungry quality settings
anyway that's gonna do it for this one

let me know your thoughts on the video
and of course the gtx 980ti
