we're putting down the shiny new second
generation rising CPUs for a different
kind of CPU comparison during all the
commotion last month until quietly
released the rest of the Intel Coffey
Lake line up and this included five new
Pentium processors three of which are
standard powered desktop models late
last year Intel announced new gold and
silver processors under the Pentium and
Celeron lines on the desktop these were
KB Lake parts with a refresh to name our
standard Pentium CPUs are now known as
Pentium gold on the desktop and since
they started with the cable eighth
generation I suppose this means that the
Pentium Gold CPUs will include hyper
threading for those of you wondering
Pentium silver is for Pentium chips
found in mobile and low powered devices
using the BGA mounting method why Intel
found it necessary to further segment
they're already heavily segmented
product lines
well that's anyone's guess but it just
makes the already very confusing
situation even more confusing for
shoppers anyway we now have the
coffee-like Pentium Gold models which
includes the G 5400 G 5500 and G 5600
these models will only work on the h3 10
B 3 6 th 370 and Zed 370 motherboards
the G 5400 comes in at an MSRP of just
64 dollars u.s. making it 15 percent
cheaper than the G 5500 while it can't
be more than two and a half percent
slower it's also 25% cheaper than the G
5600 and can't be more than 5 percent
slower so the G 5400 is clearly the best
value part that being the case I've
decided to pitch it against AMD's best
value CPU the rise in 320 200 G the 2200
G is considerably more expensive at $100
u.s. so at over 50 percent more
expensive you have to wonder if it's
worth buying before that though this

that's pretty impressive if you're
interested in building a website with
Wix head to wix.com forward slash go
forward slash Harbor unboxed to get
started okay so on paper the Rison 3
processor has a few obvious advantages
firstly it's a true quad-core CPU
whereas the G 5400 is a dual-core with
hyper threading for 4 threads it has
more cache and out-of-the-box operates
at a similar frequency and I say out of
the box because the 20/20 G is an
unlocked CPU and therefore can be
overclocked for even greater performance
it also supports higher frequency memory
and perhaps the greatest advantage of
all is the integrated GPU whereas the G
5400 packs the pathetic HD graphics 610
the 2200 G is armed with a far more
impressive a great GPU however that's
not going to be the focus of today's
comparison though I will briefly show
performance before wrapping things up
for this comparison I want to focus on
CPU performance so most of the gaming
benchmarks will be conducted with a
discrete graphics card but rather than
use the gtx 1050 or something even
slower i'm testing with a gtx 1070 to
remove the GPU bottleneck while also
remaining somewhat realistic remember
last generations flagship GPUs are only
equivalent to the current generation
mid-range graphics cards so unless you
upgrade your CPU every time you buy a
new graphics card knowing how these CPUs
perform when not GPU limited is very
important plus GPU limited testing is
just pointless anyway in addition to the
gtx 1070 other testing notes worth
mentioning include the following the
pentium g 5400 was tested on the msi h3
10m pro VT
and as the name suggests this is an
Intel H 310 motherboard one of the
cheapest you can buy therefore we have
been forced to use the standard ddr4
2400 memory spec then for the Rison 320
200 G that's been tested on the MSI be
350 mortar using ddr4 3200 memory with
this standard XMP loaded then for a
second test configuration I've upgraded
the Wraith stealth box color to the deep
core game at 200 T and overclocked all
cores to 3.9 gigahertz okay well I think
that covers everything let's get into
the results first up we have the
sustained memory banth results and here
the risin 320 turnigy enjoys 26% more
bandwidth both CPUs feature a dual
channel memory controller the main
difference being the 20 20 G is able to
take advantage of ddr4 3200 memory while
the G 5400 is limited as a tier 4 2400
or anything but a 370 motherboard here
we see when running Cinebench r15 G 5400
is 9 percent faster the stock 2200 g4
single-threaded workloads however
because the 20 20 G is a true quad core
when it comes to multi-threaded
performance it's almost 50% faster then
once we overclock for 2200 G it's now 2
percent faster for the single-threaded
test and a whopping 56% faster for the
multi-threaded test so a true showing of
dominance for the horizon 3 processor in
this benchmark next up we're going to
look at a few of the PC mark 10 tests in
fact we'll be looking at four of them
and the first one is the application
startup performance here we can see it
the G 5400 and it's punchy single thread
performance does well in this test and
it's not until we overclock the 22
energy that it pulls ahead that said
stop the 2200 G was just 5% slower so
it's not exactly a huge margin the video
conferencing test is a lot more
demanding on the CPU and here we see
these stock 22 energy
outpacing the G 5400 by a reasonably
large 10% margin then once overclock the
20 20 G is 15% faster that's a fairly
commanding lead for the horizon 3
processor the web-browsing test isn't
particularly cool heavy so this time the
G 5400 is able to hang in there with the
2200 G allowing both CPUs to deliver a
similar score photo editing is a bit
more tak
on the CPU and this allows the stock
2200 G to beat the Pentium processor by
an 8 percent margin and then a 15
percent margin once overclocked so
overall AMD does do very well in these
PC mark 10 benchmarks moving on to the
blender test and in this real-world
application we see an incredible 49%
reduction in render time when moving
from the pentium g 5400 to the 2200 g
that's very much in line with what we
saw in looking at the multi-threaded
performance with cinema r15 we do see
less of a margin between these two CPUs
and the v-ray benchmark but even so the
2200 g was still 33% faster and 37%
faster once overclocked the Pentium
processor puts forth its best effort yet
in a heavily multi-threaded test as here
it is just 24 percent slower than the
2200 G when testing with Corona that
margin though was extended slightly to
28% once we overclock the 2200 G for
compressing and decompressing archives
for rising cores are better than two
Intel cores with hyper-threading by an
almost 40% margin which is very
impressive the 2200 G also dominated the
G 5400 in our Excel test completing the
workload almost 30% faster okay so time
for some games and in total I've tested
nine titles and we will start with ashes
of the singularity everyone's favorite
synthetic gaming benchmark this game
heavily utilizes the CPU and here we see
the 22 energy offering 18% more
performance than the G 5400 and almost
30% more once overclocked
those are some huge gains right there
with the gtx 1070 Assassin's Creed
origins as a game that demands at least
a quad core and ideally you really want
a quad core with SMT or HT support the
dual core pentium scrapes by with just
32 FPS for the 1% low result and this
meant the rise in CPU is 44% faster with
46 fps
overclocking led to bigger gains in this
title and here the 22 energy was almost
70 percent faster than the G 5400 once
overclocked although we can only
accurately benchmark the single-player
portion of battlefield 1 we see the 22
energy is still being very well utilized
as it delivered 34% more performance
than the G 5400 when comparing the one
percent low results that margin was
blown out to 53% once the 2200 G was
overclocked
also note that the game ran noticeably
smoother on the horizon three CPU
Counter Strike global Offensive isn't
the kind of game I was expecting to
really favor the rise in three CPU but
here we see the 2200 G delivering 31%
more frames on average and 32% more once
overclocked overclocking didn't really
help much in this title but even so the
2200 G was still significantly ahead of
the G 5400 although the G 5400 allowed
for smooth gameplay in f1 2017 the Rison
322 energy was still significantly
faster pushing the 1% low result 25%
higher from 64 FPS 280 FPS again we see
that CPU overclocking had very little
impact in this title far cry 5 is
another game where overclocking the 2200
G did a little for the rise in CPU still
despite that it was over 30% faster than
G 5400 we're looking at the 1% low data
here we see that performance in
overwatch was very solid using either
CPU but the 2200 G was overall 45% fast
when comparing the 1% low performance
another title that saw both CPUs
delivering solid performance was Rainbow
six siege but even so the horizon 322
energy continues as winning ways
delivering around 15 and 20% more
performance in the pentium g 5400
although we can't accurately benchmark
vermintide to once things kick off you
can expect the 2200 g to be at least 30%
faster under heavy load and if anything
that margin would only grow so another
solid win for AMD in our last gaming
title tested before moving on to power
consumption oh here's a quick look at
integrated graphics performance
basically even at 720p you're gonna have
a hard time playing anything on the
pentium g 5400 without a discrete
graphics card meanwhile the 2200 g is
very respectable and when overclocked
can beat an RX 550 in some titles so if
you're going to be making do without a
graphics card for any period of time
then the horizon 320 200 G is a must
okay so now it's time to check out power
consumption and remember the pentium g
5400 is a dual-core while the horizon
322 energy is a quad core so you can
expect the faster more powerful quad
core to consume more power
looking at the far cry 5 results we see
that that is indeed the
case here the 22 energy push total
system consumption 29% higher but
remember it was 32% fastest on terms of
performance per watt the rise in three
CPU actually does better the G 5400 does
come out on top this time though for
efficiency and ashes of the singularity
here the 2200 G consume 28% more power
but was only 18 percent faster not
exactly a noteworthy margin but it does
make the rise in three CPU a little less
efficient here finally we have the
corona benchmark and here the G 5400
system consumed 43 percent less power
and here it was 32% slower so again
slightly better efficiency from the
Pentium CPU but overall still much
slower
okay so we've now looked at plenty of
benchmarks and it's pretty clear arisin
320 200 G watch the floor with the
Pentium G 5400 but is it better value
well if you're planning on gaming
without a discrete graphics card then
quite simply yes it's world's better
value simply no comparison to be made
here gaming with the integrated GPU
found in the G 5400 is almost impossible
and well at best extremely limited the
22 energy on the other hand can mimic
entry-level discrete GPU performance and
is therefore workable assuming you plan
on purchasing something like a GTX 1050
rx 560 or perhaps something more
powerful like what we tested with or you
also want to use your budget bill to get
into video editing or any other kind of
productivity work then which CPU should
you get well first let's factor in the
platform costs the MSI h3 10m Pro VD
which we use to support the Pentium G
5400 costs roughly $52 u.s. and 8
gigabytes of ddr4 2400 memory will set
you back about $75 us add those prices
to the $64 u.s. you can expect to pay
for the pentium g 5400 and you've got a
platform bill of $191 us let's just say
$190 u.s. pro nice round figure
horizon 320 200 G comes in at $100 us
you can expect to pay about $70 us for a
be 350 board the MSI be 350 mortar that
we used comes in at $90 u.s. but that's
world's better than the h3 10 board we
used in terms of quality and features so
let's work with $70 here then for the
ddr4 3,200
you'll want to allow for about $100 us
for an 8 gigabyte kit this then places
the 2200 G combo that we tested at
around 270 dollars us and that makes a
little over 40% more costly than the
Intel build of course if you factor in
the cost of a graphics card such as the
GTX 1050 then that margin does come down
to just over 20%
I should note you can also get away with
slower memory when using the 2200 G with
a graphics card and that will help
reduce the overall cost further in any
case we had a graphics card the 2200 G
as I said earlier is without question
worth the price premium a 40 percent
increase from $190 us to 270 dollars us
is well worth the two hundred and fifty
percent increase in performance for
games and not to mention you can
actually play all the latest games that
said if you're not interested in 3d
performance but you'll want to tackle
heavy tasks like rendering and coding or
whatever else then the extra investment
is well worth it as the 2200 G was often
up to 40% faster and don't try and tell
me no one does those tasks on a
quad-core CPU because I know they do so
in summary the pentium G 5400 really
only makes sense if you want to
dirt-cheap PC for web browsing consuming
media content and firing off the odd
email anything more than that investing
the extra $80 US on the horizon 320 20 G
platform is going to net you
significantly more performance and a
much better upgrade path in the future
and that is going to do it for this one
