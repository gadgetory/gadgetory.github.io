part 2 of our April Q&amp;amp;A session with
Steve and I Steve will be coming
straight back into this video in just a
moment if you missed part 1 of this
video we had that up yesterday we'll
have a link on the screen for you to
check that out right now
enough waffling let's get on with the
rest of the Q&amp;amp;A this one's from YouTube
would you recommend buying a used GPU
that has been used for mining hmm well I
think if you knew would have been used
for mining it's probably best to avoid
that because well you know it's been
flogged but if it was super cheap like
just dirt cheap then it might be worth
the risk I know plenty of people that
have bought you know known our mining
graphics cards and they're having any
problems with them otherwise yeah just
move on and look for another deal
because there's going to be plenty of
them so having said that let's be honest
90% of the used graphics cards you'll
likely to buy over the next six months
will probably be ex miners next question
comes from discord so it's from one of
our patreon members love you guys and
what's the best what's your best guess
at this point as to if we are getting a
new gaming silicon from in video this
year or just a Pascal refresh okay I
promised I would try and answer this one
but well I think it will be new silicon
so that helps well I think it will be
anyway it just probably won't be an
entirely new architecture do you think
that's fair to say probably I'm not to
say at this point yeah I'm guessing
whatever the case so it's not gonna be
radically different to what we have now
I think that's probably fair to say at
this point so not a full-blown refresh
but not something radically different
either it'll be more sort of a second
gen Pascal kind of like what we have
with second generalising mm-hmm I'm
thinking maybe that kind of advancement
that said though I don't really even
know when we release so I think we
talked to others people I'm guessing
it'll come out
November why I'm guessing that I don't
even remember I hadn't my head that'll
be November I'm sticking with it you
think it'll be early at a potentially
earlier but I've also heard November
from a kindness oh okay
I'm not sure when but there seems to be
a lot of conflicting in that date so who
knows so yeah sorry guys as usual sort
of answering these questions it's a
whole lot of nothing but I suspect
probably weren't expecting that much
either because what do we know
so from YouTube since Vega has proven to
scale exceptionally well would it make
sense for AMD to scrap the 5xx line and
produce a middle to low tier Vega
product we were actually discussing this
just a little bit earlier it depends but
really with the rx 500 line based on
pirates it's been going pretty well when
stock has been available it's got a
decent price and competitive performance
there's probably not much incentive from
AMD to replace those parts when they're
performing pretty fine right now
unless they could release like a super
efficient Vega part that was also really
cheap to manufacture so another mining
card so yeah then it might make sense
for them to make that part but
considering Polaris is going fine for
now there's no pressure for them to okay
it's not worth the investment yeah yeah
I can't see it happening next questions
from YouTube with Z 390 coming in summer
do you recommend holding off on building
and given what we already know what with
the chips it'll look like aged 370 plus
the ability to overclock it's hard to
say really like it's always one of those
questions do you wait do you not wait
but at this point we know that second
general aizen's right around the corner
I know this question isn't about rise
and but that can impact the pricing of
things like the Zed Zed 370 platform and
the process is there so you might get a
bargain or you could just wait for the
Zed 390 so but yeah with right second
gen rising so close it might just pay to
wait
yep next question is from YouTube and I
think this is gonna be an interesting
one just quickly browsing over it after
framerate goes beyond that of the
display does it really reduce input lag
yes
the input will be perceived as something
happening on-screen which is being
refreshed at the max rate then doesn't
reduce input lag or do then does the
reduced input lag really matter well I'm
just gonna sit back and get comfortable
that team handle this file this is a
good one yeah I do want to make a video
on this at some point in the future
because I think it's a really
interesting topic but basically yes the
high frame rate you're running the lower
the input lag will appear to be and
that's basically because the screen will
be able to display a frame from closer
and closer to when your input occurs as
the frame rate gets higher and higher so
even if your screen is running at just
60 Hertz having a much higher frame rate
than 60 fps effectively it gives the
display more frames to choose from and
so for every refresh assuming you have
facing off I
you'll choose the most recent frame to
when the inputs have occurred so
basically it's like having a whole bunch
of ones to choose from and instead of
having just one per refresh to choose
from it can choose the one very close to
when the refresh is actually going to
happen and basically that means that
your inputs appear to be happening on
the screen more you know close to when
you put them in so basically you should
try and run games as high as possible
but obviously with vsync you get tearing
as well but yes in general it should
reduce the input lag that you appear to
have yes so obviously it depends on the
game so it's a fast-paced first person
shooter then it makes a huge difference
in some games you're not going to notice
I know some games you won't notice
you'll just notice the tearing and then
really a very little benefit yeah like
csgo for example apparently people who
are running out like three or four
hundred frames a second or 60s motors
can definitely tell a is it's very
noticeable very very noticeable anyone
could really test this out I mean csgo
is a perfect game for testing yet
because most graphics cards it's
actually more on the cpu for that game
these days but most configurations with
reasonable settings will push well over
your refresh rate so you know locking at
your vsync at your 60 FPS and play and
it should feel pretty awful unlock it
and it'll just feel so much smoother
even though you know you can't ya just
played those full frames and those
technologies as well from I think both
in video and AMD have
but it's basically it's not vsync but
it's like it's similar to vsync on but
instead of it going through a series of
buffers before it gets this way it
basically takes the last fully rendered
frame and shows it so you get no tearing
but it's basically trying to take that
frame as soon as it comes through so you
kind of get that benefit of reduced
input lag and also no tearing not quite
as good as you know your adaptive sync
but still apparently really good for
those people who play the hard
fast-paced shooters as you say yep
well that was a good question and I'm
giving a thumbs up for Tim doing an
in-depth video on that topic all right
someone on YouTube wants to know this
about I'm assuming you in particular
Steve um
age height weight location hair color
room temperature and this is all for
research purposes they say okay age well
having built Tim's new set yesterday I
can tell you I'm getting too old that's
what it feels like
height taller than Tim look like he's
got his booster seat location Tim's
house that one was easy what was the
next one in that room temperature oh no
hair color yeah well I don't actually
die am I here I know yeah probably I
feel like I'm getting to old age wise
but I'm not there yet might be falling
out but I don't have to die yet and room
temperature acceptable yeah yeah didn't
bring my gun but probably around 20 ish
okay
all right the next questions from
YouTube I've just glanced over this
essay and I'm tapping yeah it's also one
for Tim anyway so I'm just going to sit
back and enjoy this with you guys okay
so their worst 144 Hertz 4k monitors
released not long ago by a soos and a so
their prices clearly inflated at the
moment so they're not quite released
just yet but we have seen some European
pricing that puts them sorted around two
thousand two two and a half thousand US
dollars so very expensive not a huge
surprise to me there
super high-end premium owner they're
always going to be very expensive but
they ask do I understand correctly that
these models are using the same hardware
so firstly yes they use the same AU
Optronics panel so whether you get the
Acer Asus ones there should be the same
there they also ask should I hold off
buying a 4k 144 Hertz monitor until the
technology is matured and there are more
widely available monitors among more
brands and the prices have decreased how
long could that take
and could that drop in price correlate
with the release of NVIDIA voltage
generation of cards I doubt there will
be any price shop for these motors
anytime soon there's a couple of reasons
for that firstly because there's just
that one panel there's really no
competition from you know like LG or
Samsung or anyone who could produce a
monitor that it has a spent essentially
the same specs so yeah they've got a
monopoly so they're gonna sell it for as
high prices they can until someone comes
up with something as good as well as
like very premium price point so they're
not expecting to sell a lot of them so
it's for all you Titan V owners here for
the Titan V owners then if anything
they're going to keep that price steady
until well after Envy is released their
next-gen cards they're not gonna drop
them for the cards yeah what make sense
these motors are designed for those
next-gen cards because you know
currently with the 1080 TI you're gonna
struggle with 4k 144 Hertz with a single
card yeah yeah exactly
unless you're playing a really low
setting so yeah yeah no price drops are
there anytime soon I wouldn't be waiting
around for one there for the you know
early adopter type buyers who have a lot
of money to spend that's gonna be for
your 4k 144 it's for a few years I would
think yeah I think if you have to ask
the question the answer is probably no
in these situations yeah next question
comes from Twitter what is your favorite
way to have eggs well I like em
soft-boiled I've got one of these little
plastic thing oh so you chuck in the
water while you're boiling it and it
tells you when they are perfectly done
Oh never fails like this perfectly soft
boards awesome okay well I get I'm a bit
old-fashioned with my my egg making I
crack the eggs and I put them in the pan
yeah and I won that pang it's what I mix
them around and it makes scrambled eggs
oh yeah
nyancy stuff I like that that's fine I
don't need the latest and greatest and
cooking technology to make eggs in the
morning
so tech deals has asked us what is the
ultimate answer to the ultimate question
of the meaning of life the universe and
everything you have to ask that
benchmarking ok next question comes from
discord if I want to play games on PC
that is offline forever
what games and what OS is enable that no
spine just gaming well I think I'm gonna
let two man's of this one because it
just makes me feel old because I
remember when you know cloud based
gaming became a thing and I hated it
like but I feel you feel like oh man
what happened in the days when you could
just install the game on your computer
and you bought like yeah anyway I'm not
gonna rant in right I'll let you take a
look good luck with playing games
offline these days oh yeah
always you probably have to go back to
like Windows 7 or even earlier than that
I think really with Windows 8 onwards
they start adding and all that online
stuff so yeah go back to a really old OS
for starters and then yeah most modern
games have like at least some online
something like whether it's DRM or like
you have to log into the launcher which
relies on line I stuck around anyway
yeah so basically if you want to do it
go to Windows 7 and then as you say just
download cracked versions buy the games
legitimately but like just download a
cracked version copy over and then and
you'll be going without any the online
stuff you'll be able to play the games
you're still aborted I think that's a no
solution but yeah unfortunately these
days you just it's online everything
yeah sure how are legal that solution is
but yeah it does come to that though
it's really annoying like you play an
origin or a nightmare like yeah you
can't even log in to another PC what's
still logged into yours yeah it's like
all you've logged yeah well do another
PC please close this session or whatever
yeah and then you have to reenter
username and password all over e and on
that computer when you go back to it so
that's just an at least steam doesn't do
that you can have steam on two computers
if you've got a work PC and a gaming PC
but sometimes your game on your work PC
whatever your situation is or even a
home theater PC I mean it's there's a
pretty high probability that people
would have multiple systems they game on
and if you have to do this cloud-based
gaming you don't have to keep every time
you jump on a computer I mean it's I
know it's a login but it's still
annoying or if you've got a huge
database of games and you know someone
wants to play on the home theater PC and
you want to play on your PC and even if
it's two different games you still can't
use the one steam account to do that
Alice steams very good compared to the
other ones but I just find stuff like
that annoying yeah okay okay final
question for this month's QA against a
disk coil question how sexy is the rise
and the prism cooler is it the same as
the Wraiths max but with more RGB when
will Intel respond with their own RGB
Box cooler well we can do one slightly
better than just answering that we can
show it to you again if you haven't seen
it in the flesh probably reach that from
so I think it's fair to say as far as
box coolers go it's a it is reasonably
sexy it is quite a sexy box cool decent
box cooler I'm more impressed with the
amount of copper and the direct touch
copper heat pipes and stuff like that
but yeah I mean the clear fans I think
most people aren't too into the clear
fan they got to know I don't personally
like them that much I know if I ever
feature one in a build or whatever
there's a bit of a ruckus in the
comments section below about the clear
fan being this that and whatever else
nothing positive is said about it but I
think with the the RGB in the way
they've designed the shroud around the
fan I think it'll it'll it'll look
reasonably classy for an RGB cooler as
for intel's response
they'll probably respond by shaving a
few fins off their existing cooler
they'll go with a lower profile fan that
spins twice as hard makes way more noise
and has a TDP rating of I don't know a
hundred watts at 6000 rpm and it won't
have any RGB so that's their our RGB
response will be might have a single
blue light in the middle yeah but yeah
so but on a serious note this looks to
be a seriously good cooler and in our
day 1 review we will have thermal
performance of this cooler on at least
one of the CPUs if not both yep and
compare it to a few other box coolers
and aftermarket coolers so I should be
pretty good good to look out for so
that'll be this week coming nice so
because this should be a weekend thing
alright so that's gonna do it for this
month's Q&amp;amp;A a big thank you to everyone
who asked a question and I know there
was quite a few questions we didn't get
to this time but if you react them in
the thread next month
hopefully we'll get to them because we
don't like to go over questions more
than once if we can help it so we'll get
to the other ones eventually and of
course stay tuned for our second
generation rising content coming up in
the week and I'll hand it over to Tim
for a few last words yeah big thanks to
all our patrons as well who support us
at patreon.com slash hardware unboxed
just before we filmed this we were live
through that platform so definitely
subscribe there and check out either the
live stream next month or you can of
course just watch what we did back goes
like an hour and 10 minutes a bit of fun
there and yeah I guess that's it for
this Q&amp;amp;A session we're back at this
again in May and we'll catch you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
