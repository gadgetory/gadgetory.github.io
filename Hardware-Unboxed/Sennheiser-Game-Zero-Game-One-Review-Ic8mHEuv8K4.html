for their premium and well refined
offerings their PC 350 MPC 360 gaming
headsets were popular products bringing
together the worlds of premium audio and
gaming with a microphone inclusive
headset now Sennheiser are back with a
game 0 and game 1 headsets taking over
as their prime gaming audio offerings on
the inside not much has changed the
exterior design though is markedly
different on hand out both headsets in
the black and red colorway and you
notice for the most part they're quite
similar I personally find the zeros to
be superior however in quite a few ways
the game one headset is padded with a
different firmer feeling type of foam
and is wrapped in a fabric Umesh this
feels ok and it might suit those who get
hot and sweaty whilst game you're a
little better as a word stick to your
skin as much however I much prefer the
padding found on the zero headset here
you'll find a much softer dual layered
memory foam that's wrapped in a softer
touch leather app to me this feels
significantly more comfortable both
across the headband over my head and
especially on the ear cuffs themselves
the frame and arms are different too on
the one headset they're quite standard
using a sturdy plastic that can slide up
and down in one direction and feels
quite cheap of them honest onto the 0
headset you get a rubberized aluminium
slider which connects to a steel
connector marked R or L for right and
left and allows the entire ear cup to
swivel almost 180 degrees as well as
fold up the combination of which allows
the ear cups to fold away small and flat
for traveling and for storage in the
included carry case on both headsets a
pair of arms extend downwards to hold
the ear cuffs themselves and allow them
to tilt up and down so they sit on your
head just right thankfully both headsets
feature a small rubber pad on both sides
to stop the plastic on plastic knocking
when you move them around they also
include a handy volume wheel on the
right hand side both headsets also feed
to the same noise cancelling microphone
which is not removable but it does fold
upwards and automatically mute when you
do so both headsets also feature a
removable three meter braided cable with
a split end and also come with an
additional cable that ends in a single
jack for console gamers the middle of
the arm is able to be moved to shape so
you can wrap it around in front of your
mouth and I found that was a really good
length the quality of the mic recording
is very good for gaming headset as you'd
expect from Sennheiser
I've used it to record this section of
the audio the noise cancellation works
well too I'm leaning in and out of my
open PC with fan spinning football and
it does a pretty great job of tuning
that out as you can hear right now the
sound performance of both headsets is
good
Sennheiser good the difference in sound
between the two headsets stems primarily
from the fact that the zero headset is a
closed design whereas the one headset is
open the venting on the one head says
through these lines are in the
Sennheiser logo where they're a ribbed
rubber on the zero hmm don't thought I'd
be saying ribbed rubber in a review the
zero certainly offer a more isolating
experience which in my opinion is
certainly desirable
I can't imagine many gamers actually
want to hear the ambient noise going on
around them in gaming I know when I do I
just pull one ear cup halfway off my ear
the open design of the one headset does
make the sound come through with a
little more space and openness but the
zeros already do a good job of creating
a pretty wide soundstage now the actual
sound from both headsets is excellent
it's very clear and accurate over a
broad range of sounds and they certainly
aren't limited to just gaming Sennheiser
don't supply any accompanying software
to allow you to play with profiles and
EQ etc but I paired them with my sound
blaster XG 5 external amp and DAC and
they were even better once I was able to
tune them to first-person shooters music
movies and more overall I liked both
headsets but I much preferred the game 0
headset which is designed more for PC
gamers despite the similarities in
design the 0 felt and looked much more
premium in my opinion and the design
differences all favor this headset over
the game one I much preferred the memory
foam and leather at combo but I suppose
that could be subjective what I don't
think is subjective however is the
vastly superior design of the headband
in-ear cup arms which allow the 0 to be
folded away into a compact size as well
as sit flat around your neck and on your
desk the sound quality of both headsets
is great too however I also preferred
the more immersive experience of the
clothes design 0 headset neither headset
is in the budget category with the game
0 coming in at 175 US dollars or 279
Australian dollars and the game one a
little lower at 150 USD or 239
Australian dollars if you can manage the
extra doll hairs I personally recommend
the game 0 over the game one any day but
if you're unsure then perhaps find a
retailer we can
see and feel the difference in front of
you to me though it's not in DES let me
know what you think of Sennheiser's game
headsets in the comments check out our
website our hardware box comm and I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
