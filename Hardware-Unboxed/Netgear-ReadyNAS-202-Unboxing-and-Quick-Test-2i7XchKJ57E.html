I'm your host Matt and today we're
taking a look at net gears latest home
that solution the ready knives to or to
the new ready knives 200 series features
an upgraded design improved hardware and
a new toolless snap-on drive tray to
make it nice and easy to swap out drives
spec wise we've got a dual core cortex
a15 one point four gigahertz processor 2
gigabytes of ddr3 memory and jool
Gigabit LAN which all combined for
acclaimed 200 megabytes per second tea
transfer speed in reality individual
client PC is going to be limited to just
over a hundred megabytes per second due
to the limitations of Gigabit Ethernet
the cortex a15 is becoming a popular
choice amongst nose builders we first
saw it in the Kuna TS for 31 plus in
that particular case it provided plenty
of performance certainly enough for home
users so I'm pretty keen to see how
they're ready nose 202 handles this is
the RN 202 meaning they're a true drive
bays the drives are hot swappable and
you also get three USB 3 ports and an
insider expansion port all up the
maximum capacity of this model is 12
terabytes using a pair of six terabyte
drives let's open up the box now and
take a look karate is so on the top just
the instruction manual first box we pull
out is just all the cables we've got
some mounting screws here
power brick the ethernet cable power
cable we've got three power cables here
for different regions and you've got the
unit itself so it is currently diskless
and it does weigh about well just over
two kilos according to the box the whole
model is painted in black just aside
from the back and the bottom feel that
satisfying plastic off and the front is
kind of glossy and we do have a power
button at the top an activity light
drive one in two lights and the backup
light here there is a backup button to
and a USB 3 port on the front here in
the jus drive bays on the back here
we've got two USB 3 ports an eSATA port
your dual Gigabit LAN ports and just the
power in net give us five layers of file
protection including automatic raid
snapshot file recovery real time
antivirus protection bit rock protection
and free cloud backup for your most
important files you can also set up
automatic backup from your phone and PC
and you can access your files from
anywhere on your phone using the Netgear
app now we know all this let's see how
it performs in the real world with the
our n2o2 powered on the manual directs
us to go - ready cloud Netgear com2 set
up the device this brings us to the
discover screen give me a few brief
instructions on how to set up the notes
to be discovered your alkalete setup
readiness if the are in 202 discovered
we can now set up first we create a
ready cloud account and give the device
a name and a time zone to finish setup
you have to press the backup button on
the front of the device and wait an
undetermined amount of time
it's took about 60 seconds for the
readiness to be secured we're going to
show you the web portal for ready cloud
as well as the web admins that
there's also a mobile app and PC app so
let's get started
the Reddy cloud web portal is a quick
and easy way to browse files on the
readiness as well as update firmware and
monitor a few other aspects of the nest
now here's the admin page access by
typing the NASA's IP into your web
browser or just by double clicking on
the RN - where - in the media device
section of Windows networking upon
accessing the admin page were prompted
to update the firmware version which is
a small 54 megabyte update and just
addresses a few bug fixes once installed
the user is prompted to reboot the NASS
which we did before proceeding so
loading back into the admin page we're
greeted with some system statistics as
you can see the raid volume is currently
rebuilding and also confirms that we're
now running firmware version 6 point 3
point 4 here's the volumes tab or menu
and if we hover the cursor here it gives
us information about the drive bay as
you can see we're using a pair of
Western Digital red probe 4 terabyte
drives which is set in red we're
mirroring or as Netgear calls it X ray
volume the performance tab shows us the
temperature that both the devices are
operating at as well as the CPU
temperature and the fan speed the
Settings tab gives us a quick rundown of
which services are enabled along with a
few other features and finally the power
tab allows certain power related
features to be enabled or disabled such
as just spin down and wake-on-lan the
next video is shares and here we can
view and create shared folders the
accounts menu allows us to view and
create users user groups cloud users and
so the default user next we have
networking here we can see there are two
network adapters in the our n2o2 and
we're currently using the primary DHCP
is being used and we can see the IP
that's been assigned to this port and we
can see the available bandwidth too now
the apps section where to install any
apps but if we jump to the available app
section you can see there is a wide
range of apps available in the cloud
section we have three key options
there's ready cloud which is turned on
and which we
used to initially browse the device
there was also readiness replicated and
this is used to back up data from one
readiness to another lastly there's
readiness remote which enables access to
the readiness over the Internet
overall I was impressed with the RN - OH
- the automatic network discovery worked
flawlessly and installation of
management was super easy with 100%
cloud-based software the operating
volume if the unit wasn't silent but it
wasn't overly loud either the exhaust
fan can be heard but it certainly wasn't
as loud as the drives being accessed
swapping out drives was also really
convenient so if that's something you do
regularly it's definitely something to
consider the ability to install a wide
range of additional apps such as plex
media server really allows you to
customize the capabilities of the device
so if you're a home power user this
could be the device for you thanks for
watching this video
