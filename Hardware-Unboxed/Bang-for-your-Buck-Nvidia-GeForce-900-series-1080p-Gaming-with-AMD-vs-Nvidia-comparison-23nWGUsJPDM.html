current-generation product staff
measures up when it comes to 1080p
gaming we're now gonna do the same with
nvidia geforce 900 series if you haven't
already watched that video I strongly
suggest you check it out first from the
red team we found that the Radeon r9 380
or r9 390 with the best value options
for 1080p gaming thanks to their
superior performance to price ratio the
r7 370 also did very well though we feel
it's just a little too slow for high
quality settings at 1080p the i-93 ATX
wasn't bad either but with a higher cost
per frame than both the 380 and 390 we
decided against recommending it at this
point
today we'll be revisiting the second
installment of our 1080p gaming video
with the same nine games
this means the 2013's most hyped
first-person shooter has been included
as 2015 least hype shooter and after the
adventure for just blowing things up the
best game ever created based on a
blockbuster movie series a nuked console
port that made everyone talk about The
Witcher threes graphics a game based on
a bonkers 1979 Australian film the only
game that we know of that was officially
released twice a game that was
legitimately good at dozen versions ago
and the game that one big of this year's
Game Awards testing takes place
exclusively at 1080p using a core i5
6600 K processor with the latest
graphics card and system drivers under
Windows 10 for almost all of the games
fraps was used to measure framerate
performance when we recorded 90 seconds
of gameplay in each game during the game
where we didn't use fraps was Rainbow
six siege as the built-in benchmark
works nicely
finally all graphics cards used were
clocked according to the default and
video specifications and overclocking
performance won't be taken into account
here the gtx 960 average 55 FPS in
battlefield 4 at 1080p and with a
minimum of 45 fps it was very playable
even the 950 did well as to manage to
keep the framerate above 41 fps and
to average 48 fps still the jump up in
performance from the 950 or 960 to the
970 is massive as it managed to averaged
92 FPS and never dropped below the 76
FPS mark the GTX 980 was faster again
but it was the gtx 980ti that delivers
the next significant performance boost
Batman Arkham Knight played really well
on the gtx 960 with an average of 60 FPS
and a minimum of 49 FPS the two gigabyte
models while the 4 gigabyte version only
afforded us a single extra frame despite
the 960 s doing better in batman the 950
struggle with a rather low 37 FPS
minimum frame rate which is surprising
given the reasonably strong 50 FPS
average doubling the average frame rate
from the 950 is 970 with 100 frames per
second the GTX 980 you might have been
on average 9 frames faster than the 970
but it was just 2 frames faster when
comparing the minimum frame rate call of
duty black ops 3 is another game where
we see around the 50 FPS average for the
GTX 960 and again the 2 gigabyte and 4
gigabyte models deliver the same result
moreover the 950 does surprisingly well
once again as never dipped below 39 PS
which is impressive given the quality
settings still for twice the price
roughly twice as much performance can be
had the GTX 970 is average the silky
smooth 84 PS and never dipped below 71
fps despite the large open world
environments fallout 4 plays nicely with
the 960 allowing for an average of 54
FPS with frame drops no lower than 47
fps the 950 also never drop below 42 fps
and was good for 48 FPS on average if
some 60 FPS performance isn't your thing
then perhaps the GTX 970 will impress at
1080p is that average 95 frames never
drop below 79 frames the GTX 980 wasn't
much faster than the 970 and it was the
gtx 980ti that gave us our next big
performance boost Just Cause 3 is one of
the more visually impressive and
exciting games to come out of 2015
despite the huge open world and
impressive
bitch the gameplays quite well under 960
at 1080p granted we're well short of a
60fps average here Just Cause 3 plays
very nicely with the 40 FPS average
though still 4 console crashing
performance the 970 delivered 67 FPS on
average well the 980 was noticeably
faster with 76 FPS the 980ti went on to
rendered 91 frames per second on average
and the Titan X made an impressive 102 F
yes unlike Just Cause 3 we found Mad Max
to be one of the least demanding
big-name releases of 2015 here we see
that the 950 can average 55 FPS without
dropping below 48 fps at 1080p with all
the in-game quality settings maxed out
in fact the 950 does surprisingly well
in this title as it was just 9 frames
per second slower than the 2 gigabyte
960 speaking of which we do see a
reasonably large difference between the
2 gigabyte and 4 gigabyte 960 models
here on our bridge to the larger 4
gigabyte card was 5 frames per second
faster as expected the 970 is still
delivered a huge leap forward as the
never drop below 101 frames per second
which is well above the 69 FPS average
of the 960 Tom Clancy's Rainbow six
siege plays quite well in the 960 though
at times the framerate does drop as low
as 39 FPS interestingly while the 2
gigabyte and 4 gigabyte versions of the
960 delivered the same 39 frames per
second minimum frame rate the 4 gigabyte
model was 5 FPS faster when comparing
the average frame rate perhaps the most
stunning game of 2015 is also one of the
most optimized as the 960 is able to
average 50 FPS while never dipping below
46 fps at 1080p using the maximum
in-game quality settings even the 950
performs well with the 44 FPS average
and a 40 FPS minimum still serious
gamers were much prefer the 970 as an
average 83 fps and never dropped below
77 fps making it only slightly slower
than the 980
The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is without
question the most demanding game we have
tested now as a result even at 1080p the
950 and 960 aren't really able to
deliver a playable performance of course
hair works
and turning it off will see the 960
returned to playable performance those
wanting to enjoy all the eye candy will
be better off with the 970 you with an
average of 48 fps
well the 980 was much faster rendering
57 FPS on average the power consumption
figures are aligned with the performance
numbers seen when testing with fallout 4
the 950 was only slightly slower than
the 960 and as you can see it consumed
only slightly less power the big jump
from the 960 to the 970 in terms of
performance translate to a lot more
power consumption on the 970 s behalf
that said the jump from the 970 and 980
to the 980 TI isn't as significant as
you might have expected the Star Wars
Battlefront power consumption figures
back up what we saw in testing with
fallout 4 keep in mind these are entire
system consumption figures so contrary
to what some might believe a good
quality 500 watt power supply is ample
for powering the latest Intel skylake i7
6700 K processor and the my GeForce GTX
Titan next graphics card before we look
at the cost per frame numbers let's just
summarize the performance seen in the
nine games tested on average the GTX 950
was good for 44 FPS which is
surprisingly fast considering we tested
using the maximum quality settings still
for smoother gaming experience you want
the 960 u which averaged a healthier 51
FPS for the 2 gigabyte model and 53 FPS
for the 4 gigabyte model of the nine
games tested the 4 gigabyte 960 was
noticeably faster than the 2 gigabyte
model in just two of them Rainbow six
siege and Mad Max as was the case with
the r9 380 the 4 gigabyte 960 model cost
just $20 more so it's probably worth
getting over the 2 gigabyte model though
be aware for the most part there's
little to be gained at 1080p but of
course this could change in the future
the jump in performance from the 960 to
the 970 is massive on average 62 percent
more performance was had when compared
to the 4 gigabyte 960 and this is a
staggering figure
taking all the pricing data into account
which
graphics cards represent the best value
of 1080p as you can see despite being
slow the 950 actually represents quite a
strong price per frame ratio so for
those of us Hart budget this is your
best option just be prepared to scale
down a few quality settings the 2
gigabyte 960 also represents excellent
value as we found previously and with an
average of just over 50 fps it comes
into the cost of $3 72 per frame while
the 4 gigabyte model cost $3 96 per
frame
despite being 130 dollars cheaper the
960 2 gigabyte actually cost slightly
more than the 970 per frame thanks to
the 970 is vastly superior performance
in fact the 970 turned out to deliver
the best price per frame ratio of any
current generation NVIDIA GPU as was the
case of the high-end AMD GPUs such as
the 390x fury of fury X we found that
the 980 980ti and Titan s all come in a
price premium that makes the rather poor
value at the 1080p resolution therefore
this leaves us with the 960 and 970 is
the best value options in in videos
products stack both work really well
with all the triple-a titles released
over the past few months NVIDIA has been
quick with their game ready drivers
providing their customers with excellent
support that said and video can be quick
to love and leave their customers as
Kepler based GPUs are often forgotten
when it comes to game optimization these
days leaving mighty graphics cards such
as the geforce gtx 780 Ti much slower
than they ought to be not great if you
invested 700 u.s. dollars just two years
ago now that we've collected all the
1080p data from AMD our new videos
current generation GP used I bet you'd
like to know how they compare leaving
out the low-end GTX 950 and r7 370 as we
feel they're a bit too slow along with
the higher tier products that reached a
point of diminishing returns leaves us
with the gtx 960 in gtx 970 along with
the i9 380 and 390 bang for your buck
there's no going past the 2 gigabyte r9
380 though surprisingly the GTX 970 does
very well in our tests coming in ahead
of the 4 gigabyte r9 380 390
the cheaper gtx 960 sorted by
performance were again surprised to find
the GTX 970 just a fraction ahead of the
390 which comes at a slightly better
cost per frame the results really aren't
that different to our in-depth 22-game
GTX 970 versus Iron Dome 390 comparison
published a few months ago that said
back then we did look at 1440p
performance and Judah AMD's driver
overhead they are at a slight
disadvantage when testing at lower
resolutions such as 1080p even with the
support of a skylight core i5 processor
in that particular comparison
each card won the same number of games
and the overall average frame rates
worked out to be exactly the same to the
dismay of many we went with the GTX 970
though quick to point out gamers could
happily go either way
therefore the i9 380 is the clear winner
of the $200 graphics card battle while
we still feel the GTX 970 gets the nod
is the best $300 graphics card though
this battle isn't nearly as clear-cut
