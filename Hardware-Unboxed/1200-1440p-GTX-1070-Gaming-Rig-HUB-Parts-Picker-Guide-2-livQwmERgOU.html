builder will be picking parts for an
enthusiast great gaming rig capable
1440p gameplay the budget has been set
at twelve hundred dollars for all the
core components so you'll need to
allocate additional fuel units for audio
display and peripherals as this is the
hub part speaker guide I won't be
benchmarking the system it's merely a
build guide that said I do plan to
create a hub builder video in a few
weeks time where I'll build this exact
system show you guys the process along
with around the benchmarks so then let's
get down to business the processor of
choice is our best value option from the
recent best value gaming cpu video which
you can find here that option being the
core i5 6600 k this six generation core
processor is based on the current Intel
Skylark architecture it's a quad core
processor but unlike the more expensive
by seven models lacks hyper threading
support and drops the l3 cache size down
from 8 megabytes to 6 megabytes if you
can afford to spend more the core i7
6700 k is an option but for the vast
majority of gamers there's virtually no
performance game to be had the 6600 k
can also be overclocked to make up any
performance deficit since the 6600 k
doesn't come with a block of aluminium
with some spinning blades on top we need
something that will allow us to
overclock but also won't eat too much
into the budget either the cooler master
hyper 212 series has been a top pick for
budget overclocking for well forever now
it seems the current hyper 212 X model
is very capable and been proven to keep
the 6600 k at around 60 degrees under
load when pushed to four point five
gigahertz next we need to pick a
motherboard obviously it needs to be LGA
1151 compatible and since we're going
with an unlocked core i5 processor as
every 170 board would be ideal prices
start as low as 90 dollars though most
models are priced over 100 given our
budget we wanted something a little more
capable in our own core i7 test rig we
use the asrock fatality gaming zeb 170
gaming k 6 plus it's an awesome
motherboard that packs loads of features
it's also an excellent overclocker and
more importantly overclocking is dead
easy with this board priced at around
two hundred dollars it's a nice option
but not everyone's gonna requires rich
feature set
a good entry level board that has
everything most users will need is the
Kasich pluses little brother the gaming
k for all the essentials are still
included plus a few extras such as the
killer land and I see 10 faves power
ultra em to purity sound 3 jul pti three
times 16 slots and the list goes on as
was the case with the motherboard there
are plenty of good memory options to
pick from recent experiences the G
skills try to Zed series in my custom
liquid called Corp e3 gaming read that I
built here swag my choice somewhat the
Trident is there ddr4 3216 gigabyte kid
is very cost effective you can save a
bit of money and get a lower clock kit
but we found three thousand-plus
memories idea for skylight processes for
the core p3 build i picked up the black
and white tried and sad memory but for
this build the black silver and red
memory is much more fitting by far the
most expensive component this build and
most gaming bills for that matter is the
graphics card since the budget allows
for around four hundred US or 700 ozzy
to be spent on the graphics card we went
with the obvious choice the GeForce GTX
1017 I haven't locked down which 1070
model are featuring the hub builder
version this video it'll likely be
something cost-effective such as the
gigabyte windforce or palla dual model
for example although SSDs don't equal
more frames per second I still strongly
believe they're a vital bit of kit for
what's now a relatively small price they
significantly improve the PC experience
with those glorious 0 millisecond access
times we can get away with blowing a
little bit of our budget here so we went
with the crucial mx300 525 gigabyte
model initially I plan to go the
Kingston uv400 480 gig model and while
this is a perfectly acceptable
alternative that i do now highly rate in
australia the pricing of the MX 300
series is now very competitive the 525
gig model provides plenty of room for
all the essential software along with a
couple of big triple-a titles as well
still for the games and other important
media you can't go without we suggest
sticking in a WD blue 2 terabyte
mechanical hard drive value for money
the WD blue series is hard to beat nor
though this is an old fashioned spinning
disk it'll be plenty fast as the
secondary storage device and of course
the SSD will take care of all the
lightning-fast stuff so now we need to
pick a power supply to feed the beast
you might be thinking in overclocked 66
okay along with the gtx 1070 or all the
other bits would peak to require a
high-capacity unit truth is this bill to
be very efficient and rarely consumed
more than 300 watts of power even with
everything cranked up to the max our
core i7 6700 kate sv clocked at 4.5
gigahertz along with an overclocked GTX
1080 never consumes more than 350 watts
for example still it is nice to build a
little Headroom in so we wanted at least
a 500 watt capacity this means the
seasonic 520 watt model from our best
value power suppliers video which you
can find here would be an option for
this build though we feel the need to
spend slightly more to get a power
supply with the modular design the
cooler master GM series g55 m's stood
out as a nice choice and will match our
case pic as well this is the modular
power supply that features an excellent
design great build quality and an
impressive five-year warranty units also
an 80 plus bronze certified and features
a single 12 volt rail capable of
delivering up to 42 amps a case I've
been desperately trying to find an
excuse to use this awesome looking
cooler master master box 5 this
surprisingly affordable mid tower really
has going on the only issue here is
trying to work out which color you want
it in black or white once you solve that
high class problem you later yourself
Watson arguably the best put together
sub one hundred dollar case in the
market today overall these specs will
make for a very drool-worthy PC capable
of delivering very playable 1440p
performance and all the latest titles
dearly potential upgrade options here
include the core i7 6700 k or geforce
gtx 1080 short of that you'll pretty
much have one of the best gaming
machines money can buy if enough of you
guys like this build I'll certainly go
ahead and build it to show you exactly
how it looks and performs what do you
guys think of this build let me know in
the comments i'm your host mad as always
and i'll see you guys next time cheers
guys for joining me for another episode
hardware unbox to those of you that
already support the channel thank you so
much it's truly appreciated and to those
of you that would like to support the
channel directly i do have amazon links
and a patron link in the video
description below thanks a lot and i'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
