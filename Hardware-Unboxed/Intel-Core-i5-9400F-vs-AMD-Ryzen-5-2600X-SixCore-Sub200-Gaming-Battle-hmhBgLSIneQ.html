have the Intel Core i5
9400 F on hand for some testing because
so many of you have requested that I
check out this CPU so we took some of
our patreon money and well we bought one
so I have it and I can give you some
benchmarks a lot of you have requested
that I can pair with the horizon 520 600
or 2600 X and since I just benchmark the
2600 X that that is the CPU I'll be
using and yeah we're going to see how
this compares to the Rison 520 600 X
truth be told this isn't a particularly
exciting processor at least it's not
it's not really new it's a hundred
megahertz faster than the core i5 8400 a
CPU that we quite like and I've already
tested fairly extensively on the channel
there is one other change it's not a
straight refresh with a slight factory
overclock there is other there is one
other reasonably significant change the
Intel u HD graphics 630 has been
disabled and therefore the 90 400 F has
no form of integrated graphics just like
the Rison 520 600 X for example this is
meant to make the 90 400 F cheaper than
the core i5 8400 though oddly Intel
lists the MSRP as $182 us and that's the
same MSRP as the 8400 so on paper the 90
400 F and 8400 should have the same
retail price thankfully though for the
90 400 F that isn't the case at least
currently anyway
right now the 90 400 F can be had for
175 dollars u.s. or 290 dollars
Australian meanwhile the core i5 8400
cost two hundred and fifteen dollars
u.s. or three hundred and twenty dollars
Aussie and this makes the newer 9400 F
about 20 percent cheaper it also means
it's cheaper than the Rison 520 600 X
which is currently retailing for $190 us
or 310 dollars Australian so the
question so many of you guys have been
asking me is which one should you buy
well recently in a top five CPU video I
said personally go with the horizon 5
2600 X as it comes with a much better
box cooler can be overclocked and the a
m4 platform offers a significantly
better upgrade path
I don't think that assessment was wrong
but now that I have the core i5 9400 F
on hand I thought why not run a few
up-to-date benchmarks for this one the
focus will be on gaming performance when
it comes to applications you can just
check out our day 1 coverage of the 2600
X we featured the core i5 8400 and that
one and you can safely bet that the two
and a half percent factory overclock
isn't going to make the 90 400 F any
more than 1 to 2 percent faster that
said before the video is over I will
take a slightly closer look at review
--is-- type things you know like
operating temperatures for the core i5
90 400 F using the Box cooler and we'll
just see how it gets on the main event
though will be of course the 18 game
benchmark using the GeForce r-tx 20 82
at 1080p 1440p and 4k the 4k results
should show GPU bound gaming and then
this will simulate what you could expect
to see with a lower end GPU at a lower
resolution there is two test
configurations for each CPU the core i5
90 400 F that'll be tested with this
standard into a box cool off of both
configurations on the gigabyte z 390 or
ass Master the base configuration uses
16 gigabytes of ddr4 2666 CL 15 memory
as this is what you'll be limited to on
any motherboard that's not using a Zen
370 or Z 390 chipset then we have an
overclocked configuration using ddr4
3400 memory of course you can't
overclock the CPU cause but on these n
series chipsets you can use faster
memory then we have the horizon 520 600
X which has been tested on the gigabyte
X 470 Oris gaming 7 Wi-Fi using the
standard box cooler for the base test
with 16 gigabytes of ddr4 3400 sell 15
memory now the reason I'm using faster
memory for the base configuration for
the Rison 520 600 X is quite simply
because this CPU isn't limited to the
kind of memory you can use apart from
physical limitations of the integrated
memory controller but if you spend 20 or
30 dollars more you can use ddr4 3400
memory and we strongly recommend you get
faster memory for the horizon processor
not worth saving 20 or 30 dollars if
you're seeking maximum performance then
we do have a second configuration which
is
overclock to 4.2 gigahertz on old cause
and we've tightened the memory sub
timings and installed the corsair hydro
series h 115 iron finally all the
benchmark data is fresh and was gathered
within the same week for this video it's
basically impossible for me to get all
this testing done faster than that so it
is what it is anyway I think it's time
that I stop rambling on and we jump into
the benchmarks starting things off we
have Warhammer vermintide - and here we
see at 1080p for maximum frame rates the
9400 f was 13% fast and the 2600 X when
comparing base configurations
overclocking the 2600 X pushed it ahead
of the base 90 400 F for the 1% low
figure but then pairing the Intel
processor with faster memory was enough
to get it back on path for the 1% low
and a head for the average framerate
similar margins were seen at 1440p and
then quite interestingly at 4k the 2600
X was a fraction faster in fact quite a
bit fast to an overclocked with finely
tuned memory timings you'd expect the
results here to be all identical as we
are at least should be 100% GPU limited
but that wasn't the case moving on we
have Assassin's Creed Odyssey I wasn't
expecting the Rison 5 processor to do
particularly well here so for me at
least the results are very surprising
the faster memory didn't really help the
90 400 F while the overclocked boosted
the 2600 ex's average framerate by 9%
moving to 1440 P and here we are GPU
limited and then of course much the same
as seen at 4k moving on the core i5 90
400 F was a little more punchy and for
tonight but overall the margins weren't
that significant
for example the fastest configurations
were separated by amie 4% at 1080p
naturally the margin was reduced even
further at 1440p and then at 4k we had
somewhat of a stalemate
the 9400 F was a whisker faster an apex
Legends nothing really worth getting too
excited about though
essentially you're looking at the exact
same experience with either CPU if
you're for some reason seeking big frame
rates and Resident Evil 2 then it seems
like the horizon 520 600 X is the CPU to
get at least over the core i5 90 400 F
anyway
at 1080p and their base configuration is
the 2600 X was eight percent faster and
then six percent faster when tweaked for
maximum performance that said these
margins were effectively eliminated at
1440p and 4k so for the vast majority of
you these CPUs will deliver the exact
same experience in this title here's
another example of where the 90 400 F
was faster but generally only by a small
margin when testing with just'cause for
the Intel CPU was up to 8 percent fast
when comparing similar configurations
that said the 1% low results were much
the same once again the margins were
mostly eliminated at 1440p and then
completely eliminated at 4k has to be
said hitman 2 is a horrible title for
AMD
and while the 1% low performance was
competitive the average frame rates did
slip quite a bit has to be said this
title is really bizarre when it comes to
the relationship between the CPU and GPU
though I'd say we are mostly CPU bound
at 1080p and 1440p project cars 2 is
another non AMD friendly title but
overall the results here aren't that bad
for the Rison 5 2600 in fact they're
actually quite good again we are CPU
limited at the Eternity P and 1440p
resolutions while things mostly come
together at 4k like so many of the games
we've looked at so far the core i5 9400
if does pull slightly ahead at 1080p and
rainbow 6 siege for the average frame
rate but the 1% low figures are very
similar there really is very little
difference between these two CPUs at
1080p and then basically no difference
at 1440p and 4k okay so the battlefield
5 results are really quite interesting
for repeatability and accuracy we're
using the single-player campaign here
I've done multiplayer testing the past
but it's really difficult to gather
accurate data and since that testing the
game has seen numerous patches that
address performance anyway the
single-player portion of the game mimics
the slight issue we saw with the 9400 f
in multiplayer so I suppose that's good
the experience with the 9400 F certainly
wasn't bad in fact for the most part it
was very good but whereas the 2600 X was
silky smooth at all times the six core
Intel CPU did suffer the odd frame study
here and there what's really surprising
to me is the 4k data
9400 f with ddr4 2666 memory suffered
big drops in performance and this was
somewhat corrected with faster memory
but even here the 2600 X did deliver a
smoother experience
World of Tanks has recently been updated
to better support rise in CPUs and we
see that the 2600 X does do quite well
though only the base configuration did
fall away at 1440p but still with over
100 FPS at all times the performance was
very good performance in Metro X's was
very competitive and here we're
certainly not able to distinguish
between these two processors this isn't
the most CPU demanding game out there
but it is good to see the 2600 X
matching the 90 400 F in this modern
title far cry new dawn is quite
sensitive to memory latency and shooting
up the rise and protests are really
helped here the base configuration
wasn't terrible but we did see up to a
15% performance boost from tweaking the
memory and overclocking the cause even
at 4k the 2600 X did struggled at the
most of the r-tx 20 atti without those
tweaks both CPUs delivered a similar
experience and shut off the Tomb Raider
and with ddr4 34-hundred both were able
to max out the artex 20 atti
at 1440p then of course at 4k we were
entirely GPU bound using ddr4 2666
memory the 9400 f was a little jittery
in monster hunter world though that
issue was solved with the faster ddr4
3400 memory the 2600 x on the other hand
had no issue though it was only test
with ddr4 3400 memory as the cpu has no
memory limitations on any of the
mainstream B or X series chipsets but I
suspect it's not really the memory
that's helping out the rise and
processor here but rather having 12
threads is probably beneficial then once
we increase the resolution to 1440p the
artex 20 atti became the main bottleneck
and this was of course the case at 4k as
well strange Brigade really isn't CPU
intensive at all but it is a very well
optimized title and allows us to test
using the Vulcan API
overall both CPUs performed very well
and it allows us to get the most out of
the r-tx 2082 I at all tested
resolutions despite putting on a good
show on battlefield 5 there isin 5 2600
isn't quite as nimble in Star Wars
Battlefront
and this is despite both games using the
same frostbite game engine the 2600 x
trailed the 9400 f8 1440p though once we
applied our overclock the margins were
minimal last up we have the division -
and these are some very interesting
results to finish up on using ddr4 2666
memory the core i5 9400 f maxed out at
120 fps and averaged with a 1% low of 86
FPS not exactly bad performance that but
the faster ddr4 3400 memory did boost
the average frame rate by almost 20% and
that is quite significant this place the
90 400 F on par with the risin 520 600 X
which was of course using ddr4 3400
memory for both configurations so this
title is obviously very memory sensitive
but it's also great to see a performing
so well with the Rison processor by the
time we hit 1440p we were GPU limited
with the RT X 28 ECI and the same was
also seen at 4k well given what we just
saw there I think it's fair to say there
is really no wrong option when it comes
to picking either of these CPUs they
have their own strengths and weaknesses
the 90 400 F I'd say that's overall a
little bit faster thanks to wider game
support the Intel architecture has been
more widely used and therefore it is
better supported also enjoy slightly
lower latency so that just gives it an
edge there in quite a few titles but the
2600 X with its 12 threads did deliver a
slightly smoother experience in the more
demanding games so yeah as I said
strengths and weaknesses for each CPU
but before I get too far into it I think
it's probably best that we have a look
at the average performance across all 18
games with the advantage of faster ddr4
3400 memory wherever the 2600 X isn't
artificially limited it was able to
match the core i5 90 400 F using ddr4
2060 q6 memory and this is a memory
speed that the Intel CPU is limited to
on all but the Z series motherboards of
course we can unleash the knife 400 F
with ddr4 3400 memory honors n series
board and this did offer up to a 5
percent performance boost on average
while the one percent load performance
was improved by
six percent of course the gains were
significant in some games and not that
significant and others depending on a
number of factors so 2600 X basically
saw the same gains when overclocked and
as you would expect those margins were
reduced for both processes at 1440p and
4k because we are primarily GPU bound at
these resolutions and therefore we don't
see a much more than a frame or two
difference so it's fair to say in terms
of gaming performance they're both very
similar and they are both very good
gaming CPUs when it comes to application
workloads though the 2600 X yeah it'll
pretty well thrash the 90 400 F and if
you require any evidence of that then
you can check out our 2600 X review or
anyone elses 2600 X reviews because
while they won't include the 90 400 F
they will have the 8400 the core i5 8400
and as I said earlier this CPU at best
is a few percent we're talking very low
single digit gains so yeah 100 megahertz
faster than 8400 so daily 400s a good
measuring stick there for how this thing
will stack up to the 2600 X in
applications and based on my own testing
yeah as I said it gets pretty well
destroyed by the 12 threaded arisin
processor for rendering and encoding
workloads the 2,600 actors anywhere from
30 to 50 percent faster and the core i5
processor still can't get ahead for
editing tasks either as it doesn't enjoy
a clock speed advantage for those
wondering about operating temperatures
using the Box coolers both CPUs ran at a
little over 70 degrees with an ambient
room temperature of just 21 degrees
however where is the Wraith spire was
whisper quiet and a blender stress test
the Intel Vox cooler sounded like a jet
engine therefore ideally you will want
to spend at least another twenty dollars
us on a decent box cooler to make the
thing bearable and that takes the core
i5 cost up to 195 dollars u.s. pricing
it on par with the 2600 X so back to the
original question which should you buy
the core i5 9500 F or the Rison 520 600
X frankly I feel like you're probably
going to be happy with either of them
they're both solid options that have
their own strengths and weaknesses
personally though I would stick with my
original pick which
the risin 5:20 600x and there are
numerous reasons for this firstly for
games as we just saw they're quite
evenly matched especially if you tuned
up their eyes and processor the bass
performance shown here for the core i5
9400 F can be achieved with $90 us
memory the 2600 X on the other hand will
require 110 to 120 dollar US memory in
order to enable a frame rate shown here
at least at 1080p so just keep that in
mind it's not a big cost difference and
truth be told if you had anything less
than an RT X 27 T or Vegas 64 it really
doesn't matter anyway as you'll more
than likely be GPU limited for me it's
really all about those 1% low results
here the 2600 X was much more consistent
but like I said for the most part you
simply wouldn't know which processor you
were using the 90 400 F or the 2600 X
the average graph that we just looked at
sums up pretty well for me for most of
you the 1440p or 4k results will be
representative of your gaming experience
and that is to say that you will be
mostly GPU bound they can of course be
exceptions to this older titles a
Starcraft 2 comes to mind for me that
plays much better on Intel processors
though I'm not sure that's true for this
comparison it certainly is for the
unlocked parts that can hit 5 gigahertz
but the 90 400 F is limited to 4 point 1
gigahertz so that advantage may not
apply here moving beyond games though
it's pretty easy winner for the 2600 X
any kind of serious productivity
workload yeah it's going to destroy the
90 400 F that one's pretty cut-and-dry
the other big win for the rise in
processor at least in my opinion is the
upgrade path you've got be 350 be 450 X
370 and X 470 motherboards there's a few
other motherboards there that you
probably don't want to buy but though
the point is they will all support up
comings into processes so if you do
happen to have a nice B 450 board now
with something like a 2600 X then you'll
be able to slap on one of those upcoming
rising three thousand processors later
in the year or whenever you deem it
necessary to execute your next upgrade
on that note at this point I would
suggest holding off on any CPU purchases
till the Rison 3000 series arrives
not too long to wait now finally
yeah I think it's just well worth
waiting the extra few months to see how
things pan out there but if for whatever
reason you can't wait because well for
whatever reason then the 2600 X I think
that's probably a pretty safe bet right
now that's the smartest investment in my
opinion for all the reasons I just
mentioned and I think that is going to
do it for this one if you did enjoy the
video be sure to hit the like button
subscribe for more content and if you
appreciate the Bergeron box then
consider supporting us on patreon you
will gain access to the monthly live
stream that to myself do you gain access
to our discord chat and you can speak to
Tim and myself there and just your small
contribution each month really helps us
out because it allows us to buy things
like this so when you guys want to know
how the core i5 9400 f compares to
something like the rise in 2600 x we can
buy one because although intel doesn't
really support us that well with samples
they don't sample these sort of see if
you're used to anyone so anyone who has
reviewed one of these will have bought
it themselves there's a good chance of
that so yeah just allows us to make
content like this anyway I think I've
said everything I need to say apart from
thank you for watching much appreciate
it and I'll see you again next time
