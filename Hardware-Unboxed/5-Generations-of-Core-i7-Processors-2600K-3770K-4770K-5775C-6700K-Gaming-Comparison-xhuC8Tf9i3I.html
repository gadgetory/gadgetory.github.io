core i7 6700 K a few weeks prior to its
release I ended up publishing results
that were on par with the 4790k and at
times the 6700 K was even slower there
are a few reasons for why I found these
results unaware at the time my a
driver's ed 97 motherboard was being
overly aggressive with a maximum turbo
frequency or at least how many cores
would reach said frequency on the 4790k
in other words it wasn't adhering to the
Intel spec the other and let's say
primary reason was down to the fact that
the 6700 K really isn't any faster than
the 4790k for the most part IPC
performance has only been improved by up
to 10% leading tech Sydenham tech also
found in the clock for clock gaming
comparison
sky coz no faster than as well and in
many instances was even slower which was
an odd discovery in the end I concluded
the intel's most powerful and efficient
architecture yet sky lake was for the
most part a disappointment obviously at
the time this wasn't even taking into
account the fact that six months later
the 6700 K would still retail for around
20 percent more than the 4790k
the continued incremental baby steps
entails been taking for years now made
me question if there was any real need
for Sandy Bridge core i5 2500 K and core
i7 2670 gaming due to my early adopter
syndrome my 2600 cases still was retired
in favor of the 3770k which was of
course retired from 4770k and so on
however after looking at a number of
gaming performance articles recently
focusing on games such as rise of the
Tomb Raider and Tom Clancy's the
division for example I noticed the 2600
K in 6700 K weren't that far apart
especially considering these articles
one overclocking the CPUs putting the
2600 K to
ten o'clock disadvantage interested to
know how not only the core i7 6700 K
compares to the five-year-old 2600 K but
also the 3770k 4770k and even 5775 C in
a clock for clock comparison I
resurrected my old gaming rigs the
objective is simple to compare five
generations of keio 7000 suspicions
this meant clocking and locking them all
at four gigahertz with any frequency
boosting technologies disabled along
with feed step the process is using ddr3
memory target 2400 megahertz and the
2600 K was the only ddr3 processor to
drop down to 2133 megahertz as the
memory controller isn't stable at 2400
megahertz
meanwhile the ddr4 memory used by the
6700 K was clocked at 26 66 megahertz
which we found previously to be about
the sweet spot initially I had planned
to only test them using a flagship
graphics cards such as the geforce gtx
980ti
having done so it became clear that in
conjunction with the lesser card such as
the GTX 970 we could paint a more
complete picture so it was settled the
five core i7 processors clocked at four
Giga her to be tested in nine
cutting-edge games at 1080p using the
gtx 980ti
and gtx 970 along with the game data
I've also included power consumption
figures and raw memory bandwidth data
that being said let's move on to the
benchmarks the memory bandwidth figures
between the processor and the DDR memory
range from 30 gigabytes per second to a
little over 35 gigabytes per second the
ddr4 2666 enabled sky processor
providing the best result that said the
Broadwell and Haswell processors weren't
far behind using ddr3 2400 memory it is
interesting to note that the l3 cache
yes
cache since it's not a currency is
considerably higher on the skylight
processor whereas the previous four
generations all delivered similar
performance using a gtx 980ti graphics
card we find there's virtually no
difference between the core i7 2660 700k
model the sky processor was just 4%
faster when comparing
average frame rate and 2% faster for the
minimum frame rate swapping out the
980ti for the more popular GTX 970 you
reduced the margin to just a single
percent when comparing the average frame
rate battlefield for single-player
campaign isn't particularly - actually
on the CPU so it'd be interesting to see
the correlation between the gtx 980ti
and GTX 970 on these processes in more
demanding titles here we find some
interesting results when using black ops
3 that has well Broadwell and scaling
processes all delivered similar results
however when we move from Haswell to Ivy
Bridge we see a 9% reduction in frame
rate followed by a further 5% reduction
when moving for Ivy Bridge to Sandy
Bridge this means overall the 2600 K was
15% slower than the 6700 K when
comparing minimum frame rate though it
was just 5% slower if you look at the
average frame rate now this is very
interesting reducing the available GPU
power with the GTX 970 eliminates any
difference between the 2600 K and 6700 K
completely this still very powerful
graphics card doesn't have enough
rendering power to separate these
processes in black ops 3 all out poor
might not be the best example given the
game strange tendencies with memory
bandwidth in certain areas of the game
whereas the 2600 K through to the 5775
see all deliver similar performance the
6700 K is 11% faster than the broad well
and has well processes while beating the
Sandy Bridge 2600 K by 17 percent margin
this just shows what a strange animal
fallout 4 is here we see that despite
using a much slower graphics card we
receive very much the same performance
this clearly indicates a serious cpu
bottleneck in this game which is
shocking given the average frame rate
for most of these processes is below 60
fps GTA 5 is probably the best game we
could use for such a test so these
results are worth paying attention to
like black ops 3 with the 980ti we find
the Haswell Broadwell and skying
processes all deliver similar
performance with just a few frames per
second separating them however if we
look at the Ivy Bridge 3770k
we see a noticeable decline in
performance and then again when moving
to 2600 K the average frame rate of the
2600 K was 16% slower than the 6700 K
while the minimum frame rate was 22%
lower that said it is important to know
that the 2600 K did manage minimum frame
rate of no less than 90 fps so still
obviously very playable this is again
where things get very interesting island
with the still very capable gtx 970 a
$300 graphics card you see very little
difference between these processes the
6700 K is now just 5 FPS or 6% faster
than the 2600 K and just 3% faster than
the 3770k
for a single player game Just Cause 3 is
very CPU intensive we see a bit of that
in these results even so the 6700 K
doesn't exactly crush the 2600 K as it
only provided a 6% greater average frame
rate coupled with an 8% better minimum
frame rate those are some pretty easy
difficut results for the gtx 980ti
handling the rana rig work at 1080p as
we've seen numerous times already using
a more commonly featured GPU in gaming
systems the difference between these
various processes becomes even smaller
the 6700 K is now just 5% faster than
the 2600 km and comparing the minimum
frame rate and even less when looking at
the average the popular tactical shooter
Rainbow six siege plays the same
regardless of whether you're running a
core i7 2670 K the 6700 K was less than
2% faster when comparing the minimum
frame rates and nothing more needs to be
said here give him what we saw in
testing Rainbow six siege with the 980
TI we didn't expect to see anything
different with the gtx 970m as expected
we didn't as is the case with all
multiplayer games it is impossible to
accurately test this portion of the game
forcing us to benchmark a single player
training mission as you can see with the
gtx 980ti crushing pixels there's
virtually no difference between the 2600
K and the 6700 K the margins are reduced
further with the GTX 970 and here the
6700 K was just 5% faster than the 2600
K when comparing minimum frame rates
rise of the Tomb Raider is a visually
stunning game that's also fairly CPU
intensive that said when armed with the
gtx 980ti
all five processes array would deliver
similar performance 1080p60 700k was
just 5 percent faster than the 2600 came
frame rate now with the 972 700k is just
a single frame faster than 2,600 K while
the average frame rate is identical
across the board which are three results
are surprising given we expected to see
similar average frame rate results with
a rather large variation in the minimum
frame rates
it appears the opposite is true here the
2600 K never dipped below 55 FPS making
the 6700 K just 7% faster however if we
looked at the average frame rate the
6700 K was 13% faster again not a huge
difference but more than we were
expecting given the minimums finally as
we've discovered time and time again
when swapping out the 980ti for the 970
we see any previous margins dissolved
into almost nothing in fact this time
was absolutely nothing as the 2600 K is
6700 K deliver the same minimum frame
rate result this is really where Intel
has made the greatest strides over the
past few years efficiency despite being
fast in the Sandy Bridge and CPU bound
games the sky architecture is seen
consume 14% less power in just 4:3
granted going from a total system
consumption of 335 watts down of 287
watts isn't game-changing this
improvement still comes while achieving
greater performance testing with rise of
the Tomb Raider which is similar power
consumption figures here the 6700 K
consumes slightly less power than both
the 5775 C and 4770k okay so let's get
right down to making sense of all that
data with a few fun line graphs what
you're looking at here is the averages
for those minimum frame rates across all
nine games tested the light blue bar
represents the gtx 980ti data with the
darker blue bar the GTX 970 while the
corresponding processors can be seen
below here we see there's just a 2%
performance difference between the 2600
K 6700 K using the 970 that margin is
increased to 9 percent in favor of the
6700 K once we increase the rendering
power with the 980ti
honestly these margins aren't
significant at all however you might be
sitting there saying come on man stop
shaping the results with those non CPU
intensive
aimes well I hear you so here's a 5-game
average using the witcher 3 black ops 3
fallout 4 Just Cause 3 and GTA 5 what's
interesting to note here is that again
with the GTX 970 the 6700 K is only
marginally faster than the 2600 K just
3% faster in fact the 980ti on the other
hand does allow the 6700 K as well as
the 5775 C and 4770k to stretch their
legs a bit as a result the 6700 K was
17% faster than the 2600 K with an 81
FPS average minimum opposed to 69 FPS
for the 2600 K now there are a few
things to consider here if we were to
test all five processes clocked at 4.5
gigahertz for example the gtx 980ti
margins would likely become closed out
if only slightly likewise if we down
clock the processors to 3.5 gigahertz
the margins might grow slightly too
naturally the margins would also grow
when using the more powerful GPU
configurations
particularly if SLI or crossfire is
employed for example still considering
all these factors I believe it's fair to
say the owners of an unclogged Sandy
Bridge processor really have no
immediate need to upgrade this is
particularly true when spending $300 or
less on a graphics card if you invested
around $300 on a Clio 720 600 K 5 years
ago you're probably pretty happy with
the run it's had especially for the kind
of gamer that Springs from a mid-range
GPU once every year or two be sure to
let me know what you think about the
results are you surprised about how well
the Sandy Bridge 2600 K handles the
GeForce GTX 970 I know I was having
initially tested with the gtx 980ti
