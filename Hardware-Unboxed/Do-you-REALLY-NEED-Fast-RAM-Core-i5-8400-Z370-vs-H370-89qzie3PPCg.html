have a hybrid benchmark / build video
safely that turns out to be a lot of fun
this idea came about when Coolermaster
sent over their latest line of tough
addition hardware as you probably
guessed they have partnered with a soos
and they've jumped on the tough branding
to create the MB 500 tough edition we
have the master watt 750 tough Edition
then we have the master air coolers and
that includes the master air ma 620 P
tough Edition and the master ma 4 10 M
tough Edition basically what this means
is we now have a tough themed PC case we
have a power supply there's actually two
but we have one of them here and then
there are only two coolers and we do
have both of them here so they will all
go nicely with the asou stuff themed
motherboards and it's not just cooler
master who's been hitting the gym team
groups also been working hard to try and
get buff with the new T force Vulcan
tough gaming alliance ddr4 memory damnit
guys enough with the ridiculously long
prior names you get two words two words
that's it that's the new rule apologies
for that outburst I have taken a moment
to calm myself down so let's get back to
it the final piece of the tough puzzle
is the asou tough h 370 pro gaming and I
have to say this is a component that I
own least component in that's largely
due to the fact that the motherboard
sells for $135 us and that means that
roughly half a dozen zedd 370 boards on
the market that actually cost less not
only that but as Souza's own tough said
370 board comes in at a mere $15 price
premium this is a problem because while
the said 370 board allows for
overclocking of the unlocked K model
CPUs as well as ddr4 memory the H 370
board's support neither of these
features if you're going with a core i5
8500 processor like we are see if you're
overclocking really isn't a big deal as
this is a lock CPU and therefore can't
be overclocked and an e board but we are
limited to ddr4 2666 memory and honors
ed 370 board you could take advantage of
much faster memory
but how much of an advantage is the
faster memory under typical gaming
conditions we know from previous
benchmarks using the gtx 1080i that you
stand again about 10% more performance
at best but is this still the case for
lower end graphics cards depending on
the quality settings it might be someone
effort to determine just how much
difference memory frequency makes we're
going to test three graphics cards the
GTX 1063 gigabyte gtx 1070 TI and GT x
1080 using medium high and ultra quality
settings for the h3 70 board we're using
g.skill sniper x26 66 CL 19 16 gigabyte
memory and we'll be comparing that to a
kit of the sniper X 3600 CL 1960 here
byte memory so this isn't low latency
memory but the latency is the same at
both tested frequencies this means we
will be installing both the asou stuff h
370 pro gaming and tough zed 370 plus
gaming inside the cooler master
masterbox mb 500 tough edition i'll also
be testing out both of the air master
tough edition cpu cores and i'll compare
them to intel's
epic box cooler ok so here we see when
testing with battlefield 1 at 1080p with
the ultra quality preset the gtx 1060
delivers the same performance on the HR
70 board using ddr4 2666 as it does on
the zed 370 board was much faster ddr4
3200 memory upping the GPU firepower
with the GTX 1072 ICS the faster memory
improved the frame time performance by
8% though the average frame rate is
increased by just a few percent then
with the gtx Eternity we see the frame
time performance improved by a 9% margin
while the average goes almost unchanged
reducing the quality preset to high
doesn't change much as we see very
similar performance trends to the ultra
quality preset so let's see how things
look using the medium quality settings
interestingly here the frame time
margins close up as we are likely seeing
less load on the CPU using these lower
quality settings instead now we're
seeing the average frame rate start to
increase for the gtx 1070 TI and 1080
when using the faster memory meanwhile
the gtx 1060 is still the primary
bottleneck as you probably expect when
jumping up to 1440p this
see the results become much more GPU
bound and although the gtx 1070 TI and
1080 are pushing over 60 FPS at all
times
the faster memory doesn't really help
eke out any extra performance reducing
the GPU load with the higher quality
settings doesn't change much and again
the faster ddr4 memory is if no real
benefit here then with the medium
quality settings we again see no
performance gains with the faster ddr4
memory we need to increase the GPU
horsepower to see any real benefit here
next up we have fortnight and 1080p use
in the epic quality preset the GTX 10 6
delivered these same moments on both
motherboards using ddr4 2666 and 3200
memory we see a very small 2% increase
in performance for the gtx 1070 TI and a
4 percent increase for the gtx 1080 so
nothing to write home about
now if the higher quality preset we see
a small benefit to using the higher
clocked member at the gtx 1060 is the
average framerate is improved by a 3%
margin we do though see a much more
impressive 11% improvement for the gtx
1070 TI and much the same for the gtx
1080
though we do appear to have reached the
limits of the core i5 8400 in this test
suggesting that at most these dead 317
chipset and the fasted ER for memory
well it boosts performance by a little
over 10% but let's move on to see what
the medium quality results have for us
again small gains can be seen when
testing with the gtx 1060 while the 1070
was 9% faster than the 1080 11% faster
so reasonable formats gains
though we do only see a 4% increase for
the frame time performance once again
increase in the resolution to 1440p
basically eliminates any advantage of
using the higher frequency memory at
least with the ultra quality settings we
see some improvement 1440p with the high
quality preset but for the most part the
gains are very small then finally the
medium quality settings and we see up to
an 8% improvement for the higher-end
GPUs but again the frame time results
are much the same the last game I test
it is far cry 5 and again we'll start
with the ultra quality settings at 1080p
and here we see a 7 percent improvement
for the 10 84 percent for the 10 72i and
just a single percent for the gtx 1060
the margins are much the same using the
higher quality preset so again the
to memory offers a very little in the
way of out of performance with these
GPUs even with the medium quality
ceilings the margins remain much the
same and this really was our best chance
to see any kind of noteworthy gains in
far cry 5 of course as we've already
seen twice now increasing the resolution
results in a heavily GPU bound scenario
and now the improved memory speeds offer
nothing in the way of extra performance
this is also true when you than the
higher quality preset even the gtx tay
delivers the same performance then
finally with the medium quality settings
we see once again the exact same
performance using either the h3 70 or z3
70 motherboards just quickly before
moving on from the benchmarks i tried
out the cooler master master at ma 620 p
and ma 410 m tough edition coolers but i
only had time to compare them with the
intel box cooler i'm a core i5 8400
although you can't overclock the 8400
the advantage of these big aftermarket
coolers is that they reduce load
temperatures as well as operating noise
under 100 percent load in our blender
stress test the temperature drops from
77 degrees to just 49 degrees with the
ma 410 m and then a further three
degrees with the ma 620 p impressive
stuff and if you care at all about
temperatures an operating volume these
coolers are worth the upgrade even for a
locked core i5 or i7 processor although
we saw a little to no performance gain
when using the Z 370 board along with
the faster ddr4 memory I still find H
370 boards bit of a tough sell pointless
even H 370 boards do start at $90 us
while these ed 370 models start at $100
so for just $10 more you can have as in
370 board and in this case the tough
model as I mentioned earlier is just 15
dollars more so I feel like for that
small investment you are better off with
this board opposed to the tough H 370
board and yeah $15 really isn't much to
pay for the fully fledged model the
biggest cost difference can be seen when
looking at the memory 16 gigabytes of
ddr4 2666 starts at a hundred and sixty
dollars us while the 3600 kits start at
a hundred and ninety dollars us if you
combine the motherboard and memory
prices your stand to save at least $40
u.s. and that's starting it up there
however with the memory being by far the
biggest expense
I'd still opt for a Zed
370 board and pair that with the more
affordable memory thankfully their sous
does offer an extensive range of tough
motherboards so those wanting to buy a
cooler masters master box MB 500 tough
Edition have a number of options for an
AMD themed build there is also the new
tough x4 70 plus gaming and with a rise
in process so you really could take full
advantage of those air master tough
Edition CPU coolers unfortunately right
now I only have local pricing
information for the new cooler master
tough Edition products over at PC case
key the master box is selling for one
hundred and twenty-five dollars
Australian which is $20 more than the
standard model the master what 750 also
comes in at one hundred and twenty five
dollars while the coolers cost $80 each
as expected you are paying a premium for
the tough Edition gear but if you want
that unique almost custom modded look
then this new lineup will appeal and
that is going to do it for this one if
