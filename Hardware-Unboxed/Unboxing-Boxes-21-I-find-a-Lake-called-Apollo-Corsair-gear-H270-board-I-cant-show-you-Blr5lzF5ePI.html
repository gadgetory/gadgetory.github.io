welcome back I hope wherever you are
you've either had a good Christmas or
you're currently having a good Christmas
and if you're currently having a
Christmas you probably shouldn't be
watching this video anyway in the
Christmas spirit
we should probably unbox some more boxes
since it is Monday and we have a few
things here to get through in all the
excitement it looks like this as a rock
boxes busted it's tie we'll start with
this one then ah cool we actually have
some interesting boards here oh yeah
it's jam-packed - this box made to fit
right so these guys are all based on the
new Apollo Lake
basically it's system-on-chip so SOC a
lot of you guys probably haven't heard
about it because like Braswell before it
intel sort of announces or doesn't even
announce these just lets them out
quietly and they're basically designed
for netbooks and low powered pcs and all
that kind of stuff they Kemp they come
in under the core range or the so you've
got the core i7 core i5 core i3 Pentium
Celeron and in these guys which sort of
they do come under the Celeron and
Pentium branding okay so these two are
based on the same SOC and then that is
the high-end model so let's start with I
think this one here is a micro ATX board
so you get a pair of SATA cables IO
shield manual driver CD and that's it
so there you have it
basically the makings of a well it's
basically a bare-bones so you've got
your processor there which includes the
chipset and all that sort of stuff you
do have a PCI Express x 16 expansion
slot with a pair of one time slots and
then a pair of what would be ddr4 dimm
slots USB 3 is supported and around the
back you get a pair of USB 3 ports and
all the basic display outputs Gigabit
LAN basic audio
you're a real tick it looks like it's an
eight eight seven codec basic little
board but it has the Pentium 3 4 5 5
processor so I believe that the desktop
versions of the Apollo Lake series
feature three SKUs
I think there's true Pentium and one
cell run ship I'm not a hum percent sure
on that either way there's only a couple
of them ok so yeah this is the quad-core
version that operates up to 2.3
gigahertz so that would be the pentium
model so anyway a neat little board
there I'll stick this stuff back in the
box and then this here should be the
Mini ITX version so again you get 2 SATA
cables IO shield manual wow this has a
parallel printer port on it so this has
a bit of a legacy support and that you
get a comport ps2 ports so it's more of
an industrial kind of version I would
say anyway you've got the laptop DIMM
modules for this one again ddr4 memory
will be supported plenty of USB 3
support actually more than the other
board on this one and you've still got
that PCI Express x 16 slot pair of SATA
headers onboard so this one's a very
basic mini ITX version and this year I
believe this to be the flagship model so
again you've got a quad core processor
this one operates at up to 2.6 gigahertz
and again that will be a that's the
Pentium J 4205 all the same gear in this
package and we have a mini ITX board
here this one's a bit more high-end so
you get straight away you can see but
better audio same sort of video output
stuff Gigabit LAN USB 3 there's another
USB 3 header onboard there's 4 SATA
ports you get em to Wi-Fi or you
optional anyway well so we got here and
it's obviously a laptop style memory
again for the ddr4 interestingly you
only
yet a PCI Express times one connect and
all the time 16 on this board I mean
you're not really gonna be using this
for gaming I throwing the high end
graphics card in anyway pretty much a
complete product ready to go sticking in
there add some memory add some storage
and you're away yeah cool little board
and yeah this SOE say you should be
fairly powerful I'm pretty keen to give
it a test actually because Intel is
claiming something off the top of my
head it was something like 30% faster
and sis mark and the graphics
performance I think in the 3dmark
skydiver test that was like something
like 45% faster so they're massive
performance claims over the Braswell
quad core SOC so yeah
keen to give that a go and see how it
performs all right we'll get into this
little package so I found it and stopped
looking all right so what do we have
here I wonder okay no clues yet that's
that's what I've opened the box to but
they are Corsair products
so first up where you have cool the
force Ally 480 gigabyte SSD so this is a
pretty cool budget sort of entry-level
SSD it is a decent size at 4-under and a
gigabyte and it is backed by a
three-year warranty
it's a solder 16 bits per second SS s 16
bits per second SSD bit of a mouthful
using TLC nand and it has a fire and
controller i believe which supports 256
bit AES hardware encryption powerful
protection and smart ACC technology so
having a bit of a look online the cool
thing about this Drive is it appears to
be very very aggressively priced it's
priced better than Samsung's 850 Evo and
in terms of performance it isn't that
much different the only downside I could
find is the fires on s 10 controller is
a little bit sluggish with small block
writes but I mean it's not terrible by
any means it still gets along fine but
that's about the only weakness that I
could uncover for this particular model
so this is actually the first ingredient
in a very cool build of
doing that Corsair sponsoring they're
actually sponsoring our next generation
benchmark rig so just by coincidence at
the moment the current core i7 rig that
we use has a corsair case i think it's
the carbide 600 c we also use some
corsair memory in there and we actually
use a corsair all-in-one liquid cooler
as well so there's quite a bit of
corsair gear in the old system that
wasn't sponsored it was just purely
coincidental stuff we pure coincidence
it was just stuff that we had laying
around and we really liked it so we used
it and they've also supplied for that
build some memory and again
coincidentally we're using the this is a
3,000 megahertz stuff we're using a 30
200 megahertz stuff in the current test
rig and it's the exact same a vengeance
LED memory but we're using the red
modules and these are blue because the
theme that we'll be going with I think
it's blue and white or blue white and
black so that's going to look pretty
cool
these modules do look pretty amazing
I'll just get them out and show you them
they look impressive even when not
active but when lit up there I'm very
cool indeed so there you go if I get
time with all the stuff that's going on
at the moment with Christmas and whatnot
and all catching family and stuff if I
do get time I'll plug these in and get
some b-roll of them lit up but if I
don't
don't worry because probably in the next
week or so I'll be doing a video with a
really cool build using all the corsair
bits to make our new test system and
that's gonna be awesome so yeah anyway
there you go 4 modules 32 gig of ram and
it runs at 3000 megahertz alright last
box we're getting through this fairly
quick quicker than normal anyway that's
annoying yet another motherboard I can't
show you guys well I thought we had
three boxes we only had two in the end
that's happened to me quite a few weeks
in a row now which has been annoying
it's gonna be really bad when Zen lands
I know it's not going to even it will be
for the unboxing series cuz I imagine
there'll be a heap of am4 boards coming
I'm not expecting and we'll find
ourselves in that situation where I'll
probably end up with four boxes to our
box a little B's n boards or a.m. for
boards so that's pretty much wraps this
one up we looked at three Apollo boards
Apollo Lake boards a cool budget Corsair
SSD and some awesome Corsair memory so
pretty light on things to unbox for this
episode there is a very cool looking
motherboard here which I'll probably
review but it'll be a what we're about
we're only about a week and a half or
two weeks off that release now so not
too long away anyway that gets the
unboxing out of the way just want to
wish you guys a Merry Christmas again I
really hope you have a relaxing and
enjoyable holiday break and though I'm
trying to which is kind of why rush this
one together but anyway next week we
will have more content coming there's at
least one cool video benchmark type
video this week and maybe a pro review
or something else but there'll be
there'll be two videos this week I sort
of squeeze them in last week and I'll
probably hopefully get a bit of work
done this week we'll see how we go
anyway that's all for this one I'll
catch you guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
