it possible for tumour myself to attend
Computex 2019 please check out their
latest AMD x5 70 motherboards made for
gamers and creators by the link in the
video description also thank you to
Corsair for their support please check
all their exciting products out via the
link in the video description welcome
back to hardware unboxed we're here at
Computex 2019 I've just been to the
Nvidia event so like AMD this morning in
video hosted an event in the afternoon
and well gotta say not too much was
shown off at the event the main thing
that you guys will be interested in was
the super teaser that they posted on the
NVIDIA GeForce Twitter feed I think was
on YouTube as well I think a lot of
people at the event were expecting
Nvidia to detail what super meant but
unfortunately no mention of super at
Computex whatsoever in fact we were
heard at the event that that is
primarily going to be an e3 reveal so if
you're expecting that teaser to be
resolved here at Computex like we were
yeah unfortunately the event which
wasn't live streamed
yeah really didn't cover it super at all
and you'll have to wait for III for more
details on what that brings
unfortunately also didn't manage to get
in any information on what super
actually meant either so yes still up in
the air on that one unfortunately
alright so moving into the things that
Nvidia did actually announced at their
event and we'll start with g-sync
I think because for me at least being a
monitor sort of guy that was probably
the most interesting stuff so firstly
the 34 40 by 1440 g-sync ultimate
display so the HDR ones with I believe
200 Hertz refresh rates I did ask about
where they're still 200 Hertz and got a
bit of a vague response on that one so
we'll have to find out more on the show
floor but those monitors are now ready
so the models from a soos Acer and AOC
should all be coming out very shortly
they were announced more than a year ago
so it has been quite some time since we
first saw these products but in video
tells us that those are ready to go more
exciting than that mini LED g-sync
ultimate monitors so we've got two
models coming out one of them is the
asou speed
g27 uqx that has a 576 zone backlight
made up of 2304 LED lights so much more
impressive than the 384 zone LED
backlight for the original PG 27 UQ
there's also an ASA model coming out
both of these should be on the show
floor so hopefully we'll get some more
information on that when the show floor
opens tomorrow but for now mini LED
g-sync HL monitors so that's really
taking the g-sync HDR thing up another
notch and finally on the monitors 4k 120
hertz laptop displays which was a bit of
a surprise I was talking to Jared from
Jared's tech you might know him go
subscribe he make some really high
quality laptop videos but we were both a
bit surprised about the 4k 120 Hertz on
laptops because we don't find 4k
displays on laptops to be too useful
than to be very small the GPUs they
really can't run a 4k resolution very
well and won't really benefit from the
high resolution but I suspect it might
be more of a creative thing on that one
we also have new r-tx games the first
one is quake 2 you might have seen I
think it was the fan mod that some guy
made and they brought ray-tracing into
quake 2 well that's now being turned
into an official game it'll be made free
on June 6 you'll be able to get some
single-player levels for free I think
and then the full game will be available
ray-traced for owners who you're already
own quake 2 on the same day as well
they'll be available on Steam and that
is a partnership with Bethesda who makes
that game the other game
Wolfenstein Youngblood that is now got
our TX functionality in it as well as
adaptive write shading that's coming out
on July 26 so again more r-tx games and
as well buyers will get that game buyers
of nvidia gpus i should say from the
artex between 60 through to the RT x 20
ATT i will get that game for free when
you make a purchase
starting tomorrow or one of the days we
see it on the screen now I've got some
b-roll of that that will give you all
that information the final thing that in
video showed at the event was a whole
bunch of Creator related stuff falling
under their new Nvidia studio brand now
to be honest probably not the most
exciting thing for you guys for mostly
gamers and interested in the GeForce
brands didn't really interest me too
much either but there were lots of demos
there some of them work on
interesting so maybe with raps and
b-roll of that but the main thing here
is there will be 17 new invidious studio
laptops launching here at Computex from
all the major brands you know your aces
yeah a soos msi gigabyte all those
companies I think Razer as well they
have new laptops starting at 1600 US
dollars the key feature they're up to
Quadro r-tx
5000 quadratics 5000 GPUs the key thing
here that really brings to the laptop
form factor for the first time is a 16
gigabyte frame buffer so with the r-tx
GPUs like your 20 80s previously up to 8
gig but for creators who need that extra
frame buffer you will get up to 16 gig
with those new Quadro cards
you also will expect things like 32 gig
of ram your Intel Core i 9 CPUs the 8
core models also the 6 core core i7s
will be all throughout these creative
range slim and light models that was one
of the the main features that in the
video was going through as my screen
goes black here yeah so lots of slim and
light designs that really meant for
creators working on things like
Photoshop on premiere on 3d modeling all
of that was discussed and NVIDIA made a
big deal about how much faster their new
Quadra laptops with the Intel CPUs are
compared to the MacBook Pro which uses
AMD graphics but then they mentioned AMD
at the show but that was kind of the
comparison they were making there in
video studio drivers as well that will
be coming as sort of I think they said a
quarterly release so the aim there is
that you get really stable drivers that
are focused on optimizing you know for
your creator apps like your photo shops
your premiere so I was just talking
about before rather than relying on the
gaming drivers that tend not to be not
players nicely with some of those
creator apps so I think NVIDIA has had
created drivers for a little while now
but they will be folding into this new
studio brand so those are really all the
things that every year showed off at
their Computex 2019 keynote nothing on
super as I mentioned earlier that will
be coming in 8th at e3 few things on
g-sync a few things on our TX games and
all that creative stuff so yeah probably
not as exciting is the AMD content that
Steve covered earlier today certainly a
lot more was talked about at that
keynote but similar to I guess last year
where NVIDIA doesn't really use computer
as one of their main sort of
presentations for new products they tend
to stick to launching GPUs and other
products at their own events so wasn't
too surprising that they sort of kept a
lot of that information out and we'll
see that later in the year so that's
really it for this video thanks to our
major sponsors MSI and course Ava
managed to bring us over for Computex
2019 will be hitting the show for
tomorrow where you'll start to see
everything there so plenty of stuff
coming up throughout this week on
Computex don't forget to subscribe to
catch all that content consider
supporting us on patreon and I'll catch
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
