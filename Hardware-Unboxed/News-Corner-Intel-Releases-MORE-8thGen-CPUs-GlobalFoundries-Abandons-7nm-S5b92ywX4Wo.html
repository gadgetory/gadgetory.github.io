corner lots of news coming in this week
thanks to e 420 80 which is currently
happening over in Germany where we've
seen a ton of new laptops and displays
launched on top of that though this week
we did hear about Global Foundries
ending plans to offer seven nanometer
manufacturing so a fair few topics to
cover let's get right into them first
story of the week Intel launched a new
selection of CPUs but don't get too
excited because they're not new ninth
gen desktop CPUs like the long-awaited
eight core core I $9.99 hundred K
instead Intel strangely released a new
selection of 8th gen mobile parts
codenamed whiskey like you and amber
Lake why I'm not entirely sure why these
are 8th gen CPUs when it seems Intel be
rolling out 9th gen shortly but here we
are a year after KB Lake refresh
launched as 8th gen we have whiskey Lake
also as eighth gen so fun times not a
whole lot of interesting stuff to say
here to be honest these new CPUs improve
upon their predecessors by offering in
ninety of USB 3.1 support and an
integrated 802 211 AC controller as for
actual SKUs let's first go through
whiskey like you these are 15 watt parts
like KB Lake refresh you were previously
and we're still getting four core eight
thread core i5 and core i7 CPUs along
with two core four thread core i3 s the
only real difference is a slight bump to
clock speeds the core i7 85 65 u has a
base clock of 1.8 gigahertz and a boost
of 4.6 gigahertz so that's up from the
1.8 gigahertz pace and 4.0 gigahertz
boost of the existing KP like refresh
core i7 8550 you you get similar bumps
with the core i5 82 65 you and the core
i3 81 45 you graphics and cache are the
same as before as far as amber lake is
concerned these are the first eighth Gen
Y series part so they pack a 5 watt TDP
originally the plan was to have a 10
nanometer Cannon Lake as Y series parts
but due to delays and issues that never
really eventuated it's what we have
instead our amber lake which are 3-2
core
for thread CPUs with UHD 61.5 graphics
but don't get excited for anything new
these are again just basic clock speed
boost to older seventh gen KB Lake parts
the core i7 8500 why for example jumps
up to a 1.5 gigahertz base and 4.2
gigahertz boost clock compared to a 1.3
gigahertz base and 3.6 gigahertz boost
for the core i7 7 y 7 5 it's again
similar for the core i5 8200 Y and core
m3 80 100 why getting these sorts of
minor clock speed bumps within the same
TDP rating is always nice but we'll have
to wait and see whether there is any
real-world difference in things like
sustained clock speeds and actual power
draw compared to existing parts still
these new whiskey lake and amber Lake
parts +12 systems that previously used
either kb lake refresh or kb likewhy
quite nicely and as you might expect
whenever there is a new mobile cpu
launch from intel we get a range of new
laptops from all the major vendors I'm
not going to go through everything in
detail but if you are after a new laptop
there are plenty of decent looking
options from companies like Dell Lenovo
ASA and a sous dell for example launched
a new XPS 13 21 that includes intel's
new
Amberleigh qui process is giving a minor
cpu upgrade they also launched a cheaper
XPS 13 configuration with the core i3
81-34 just $900 asa launched the
lightest ever 15 inch notebook the swift
5 or just 990 grams which packs a
whiskey lake cpu and will be available
in January for $1,100 a so also launched
the 14 inch Swift 3 with whiskey Lake
and an MX 150 stunning and $800 for
masseuse we have the Zen book 13 14 and
15 which use Intel's new CPUs and up to
a GTX 1050 max-q GPU in slim bodies with
new expansive slim bezel displays Lenovo
here a bit of a strange warrant from
them they launched a new yoga book that
bizarrely is using seventh Gen Y Series
parts rather than 8th gen and yeah
probably won't talk and even her about
these new systems perhaps the biggest
story to break this week Global
Foundries has announced they are ending
the development of their seven nanometer
fabrication process the company has
stopped all work on 7 nanometers will
not produce seven nanometer chips for
any customers and will stead focus on
specialized process technologies for
client
in emerging high-growth markets at least
that's in an antics
own words and as far as that stuff is
concerned we're talking more about 14
and 12 nanometers start the RF customers
and so forth rather than cutting-edge
seven animator tech this new surprise
most of us considering the enormous cost
of developing a new process node it's
not something you simply decide to stop
working on at the drop of a hat instead
this is a massive strategy shift for
Global Foundries and ending all
development on seven animators will
likely cost them billions of dollars
especially considering the node was set
to be ready in the fourth quarter of
this year the company even confirmed the
decision to stop work on seven animators
was not based on technical issues but
rather ongoing financial concerns
perhaps they were simply not enough
customers interested in their 7
nanometer node I mean it's really hard
to say at this point in canceling seven
nanometers Global Foundries
also can't work on five nanometer and
three nanometer of research and
development so it's clear the company
isn't interested in being a cutting-edge
fabrication facility anymore an 8x
article goes into more depth on what
Global Foundries will be providing
moving forward but it's definitely
disappointing to see the number of
leading-edge fabs drop down to just two
samsung and tsmc will be the only
remaining ones that provide I guess
their services to other parties and then
of course there's Intel if you want to
count them as well as for the major PC
chip manufacturers AMD was one of
globalfoundries biggest customers the
two companies work together for both
CPUs such as Rison and GPUs like Vega
and those were on Global Foundries 12
nanometer and 14 nanometer nodes however
moving forward AMD will shift using tsmc
for CPU and GPU manufacturing and it
seems this has been in the works for
some time so it shouldn't be a massive
hindrance for AMD you know existing
projects like seven nanometer Vega and
seven nanometer epoch were already set
to use TSM sees process tech basically
this is just a confirmation that other
seven nanometer projects will be using
it tsmc as well again I don't expect
that to impact them too much in video of
course they've been a tsmc customer for
some time so this Global Foundries news
doesn't impact them whatsoever while
Intel again they use their own fabs and
they are having her own set of issues
moving to their equivalent 10 nanometer
node so yeah be really interesting to
see what happens with
foundries moving forward and I think
tsmc will certainly continue to submit
themselves is the biggest third-party
fabrication facility out there couple of
interesting new monitors have launched
Eva from Acer and Samsung we'll start
with the ACE offerings first up is the
Acer predator xB 273 K and that's a 27
inch 4k IPS monitor with the maximum 144
Hertz refresh rate and gsync support
we're also getting HDR support certified
for display HDR 400 with 400 nits of
peak brightness and 90% DCI p3 coverage
but you shouldn't confuse the predator
xB 273 K for the predator X 27 the X 27
is aces flagship HDR monitor with a
thousand it's of peak brightness and a
384 zone local dimming backlight the xB
273 K appears to ditch the fancy
backlight for a more traditional one
with that local dimming while also
ditching the quantum dot film which
shaves the price down from $2,000 to
just $1300 when it's released in q4 I
saw also unveiled a collection of new
high end nitro monitors the Nitro XV 273
K is basically a free sync version of
the predator xB 273 K and will cost $900
so at decent $400 cheaper than the
g-sync equivalent there's also the
27-inch Nitro XV 272 U which is a
27-inch 1440p IPS panel at 144 Hertz
likely without HDR for $500 and then
there's the Nitro X F 272 you Italian
version of the XV 272 you for four
hundred and fifty dollars samsung also
announced the new ultra wide monitors
the c 34 j 791 is a 34 inch 34 40 by
1440 VA panel at 100 Hertz with freesync
a 1500 her curve and 125 percent srgb
coverage with quantum dot there's a
Thunderbolt 3 input in addition to
DisplayPort and HDMI and will cost about
880 euros the c 43 J 89 is a 43 inch
38 40 by 1200 VA panel at 120 Hertz with
an 1800 curve and the c49 J 890 is a 49
inch 38 40 by 1080 VA panel
1:44 hurts also with an 1800 R curve the
49 inch model also cost around 900 euros
lots of numbers and letters that get
through I can't move I may through that
in just one take on the show floor a
optronics showed off their new 32 inch
4k 144 Hertz HD arm panel with multi
zone back Lane that will be coming to
monitors shortly as a larger equivalent
to existing displays like the PG 27 new
Q news also a broke that invidious big
format gaming displays have been delayed
to q1 2019 the BFG DS are basically
high-end 65 inch TVs with HDR g-sync at
least a thousand its of brightness DCI
p3 coverage and so forth they're also
set to cost between 4000 and 5000 euros
which is right up there with the prices
of high-end OLED TVs so you'd hope the
picture quality is stunning what else we
got here I guess battlefield 5 that's
been delayed until November 20th the
game was originally set to come out on
October 19th but dice apparently wanted
to make some meaningful improvements to
the core gameplay experience based on
feedback from the closed alpha so it's
been delayed u-l are developing a new 3d
mark test that would utilize ray tracing
specifically microsoft's directx ray
tracing which technologies like nvidia
RT x then utilize it'll be a new
separate test to existing tests like
fire strike and time spire and
apparently it should be ready for the
launch of invidious new GPUs around
September 20th final story of this week
Jim Anderson has departed AMD's
computing and graphics group where he
was senior vice president and general
manager and he'll be joining lattice
semiconductor as CEO Anderson will join
lattice on September 4th having joined
AMD in June 2015
let us make programmable logic devices
like fpga is just in case you were
wondering that's it for this week's news
corner plenty of interesting stuff going
on and I expect next month will be even
more hectic with launchers from Nvidia
and perhaps more launches from Intel fun
stuff anyway if you like this segment
