talking about assassin's creed Odyssey
again following on from Steve's massive
I think he had more than 50 GPUs in its
benchmark of the game went up on the
channel yesterday as you probably would
have quickly realized in that video
Odyssey well it just doesn't run very
well on some GPUs particularly mid-range
options following on from what we saw in
2017 Assassin's Creed origins but there
is good news for those concerned about
performance well sort of I have
benchmarked every quality setting in the
game and compared them all visually and
I think there is a bit of optimization
that can be done to recover some
performance without losing visual
quality in fact my custom selection of
settings ended up delivering performance
close to the high preset while
delivering visual quality near
equivalent to the maximum ultra high
preset throughout this video we'll be
progressing towards that result and
showing you the exact settings you'll
need to tweak because Ubisoft default
presets are pretty rubbish in my opinion
there's a lot of strange choices made
and some things that just completely
tanked performance for no reason so
we'll point those out when we get there
however and this is also a bit of a
precursor for what's to come
Odyssey doesn't scale down particularly
well without making the game look like
complete garbage you can gain
performance at the high end while
getting very good visuals but there are
plenty of settings that don't give a
great boost to framerate when you turn
them down despite having a larger effect
on quality so yeah it's a bit of a
rollercoaster this one as always a few
quick notes before we get into it the
graphs coming up are in percentage gains
not raw FPS because it better
illustrates how the setting tweaks apply
to your setup we benchmark with a
variety of GPUs from both AMD and NVIDIA
high-end and mid-range and averaged out
the results so what you see here should
apply to roughly every GPU give or take
a few percentage points and if there's
anything that might affect one GP over
another we do point that out we did
still test using our core i7 8700 K test
rig overclocked to 4.9 gigahertz so we
were entirely GPU bound in this
it is a fairly demanding game on the CPU
but when you're playing at higher
resolutions like 1440p at 4k tends to
still be GPU bound and lastly all
captured boards you see he is from an RT
X 20 a TTI running the game at 4k Steve
used the built-in benchmark for testing
I used a few custom in-game benchmarks
to better capture the impact of all the
game settings so results between what
Steve showed in this video yesterday and
what I show here may differ a little we
also recommend watching this video at
youtube's maximum 4k quality or you can
download a source quality file from our
patreon page so first we'll start with
the presets I really don't recommend
using the presets but understandably
some people will just want to choose the
best one out of the five Odyssey
provides because it's you know pretty
easy and to be honest when putting them
all side-by-side there's not a lot of
visual difference that's immediately
noticeable particularly between ultra
high very high and high with medium you
start to see reduced texture and shadow
quality as well as a general reduction
to the lining system while with low
everything is stripped back particularly
textures which are now well definitely
potato quality the differences between
the highest three are the most nuanced
with each mode offering slightly better
shadows interestingly the point at which
low resolution shadows are swapped for
high resolution shadows remains the same
for all presets however the high presets
use better quality shadows for both far
and near shadows aside from minor
improvements to clouds water quality and
ambient occlusion the high presets also
offer better draw distance it's much
noticeable in the benchmark but it also
looks similar to this in the more
densely populated areas of the game
ultra high renders higher quality
objects further out and this distance is
reduced for very high and high I find
the level of poppy and pretty noticeable
for the high preset having entire
objects pop out of thin air quite close
to the camera is a bit jarring it'll be
nice for the game to better handle those
transitions when it comes to performance
you'll want to immediately switch from
ultra high to very high as there's a
pretty small visual difference here and
while the performance improvement in our
benchmark was only 12 percent or so that
margin is higher on low-end cards and
lower resolutions
as some of the sayings opt users are
particularly taxing Steve showed up to a
30% improvement on it
dx10 60 at 1080p using the built-in
benchmark you are gonna see less than
that in the actual game but it's still a
big performance uplift simply from
shifting down to very high
however our preference here is actually
to use the high preset you do get
reduced shadow quality and view distance
compared to very high but we're looking
at a 12% increase in performance in our
non canned benchmark and a 25%
improvement over ultra medium is also a
good choice for mid tier GPUs giving a
reduction in quality for a boost in
performance unfortunately I think the
medium preset is really where the game
tops out as low looks pretty terrible so
at best we're seeing a forty seven
percent improvement between ultra and
medium that's not surprising considering
what we saw with origins but it's
disappointing when you look at the
overall performance of the title now the
fun begins as we move into looking at
every single game setting in detail and
there are some absolute shockers in here
so stay tuned we'll start with
anti-aliasing because this is a strange
one obviously actually has four modes
here and all but off I guess use
temporal anti-aliasing or taa to some
degree Odyssey is taa implementation is
not great it's improved slightly
compared to origins from what I could
see just doing some pretty basic visual
comparisons but it's still a bit blurry
in some instances reducing the clarity
of the game's excellent texture work the
high mode for example does cut out
shimmering and most area Singh butts at
the expense of a very soft presentation
which looks a bit blurred even at 4k I
feel this game is really missing an SMA
option I tried to add that in with rece
shade but I only tested for about two
minutes and I couldn't get the game to
load properly SMA would better preserve
fine detail while removing a lot of the
aliasing for little performance cost
bits in the medium and low anti-aliasing
modes that are particularly interesting
it's hard to tell but I think Ubisoft is
using some form of temporal
reconstruction when you enable medium or
low in other words the game is being
rendered at a sub native resolution then
temporally upscale to whatever
resolution is set that's because both of
these modes provide a performance
improvement compared to no anti-aliasing
and both medium and especially low are
even less blessed with detail than high
looking at the performance breakdown you
get 5% more performance with medium and
16% more width
low compared to high or no anti-aliasing
both which deliver the same performance
normally anti-aliasing decreases
performance but whenever you see better
performance again it's likely using some
sort of reconstruction technique I
haven't spent a lot of time trying to
figure out exactly what's going on but
after looking at some comparisons
my guess is low actually renders the 4k
image at 1800 P or there abouts if
you're really struggling for performance
you might like to experiment with low
but for me the presentation is far too
soft I'd stick with high or even no
anti-aliasing here particularly at 4k
shadow quality I touched on a bit when
discussing presets this city impacts two
key elements the resolution our close-up
shadows and the quality of shadow is
further from the camera the point at
which you see the transition between
close and far shadows doesn't change so
all modes have some level of popping
which is a bit disappointing this game
engine certainly doesn't have a blending
feature that's as nice as some others
ultra high comfortably has the highest
resolution shadows both near and far and
that helps reduce the visibility of the
transition everything from very high
down uses a pretty low resolution far
shadow and there's not a great
difference overall between very high and
high medium and then low both step down
the resolution of closest shadows the
setting is the tough one to choose from
there's no significant performance
difference between very high and medium
so the easy choice there among those is
using very high you do get around a 3
percent uplift shifting from ultra high
to very high but it comes at a
noticeable loss in quality with greater
pop and visibility I reckon this is one
of the more noticeable visual downgrades
in the game so if you have the GPU power
I'd really recommend keeping it on ultra
high and trying to sacrifice a bit from
the other less important settings if
you'd rather get more performance very
high is a good choice environment
details only impacts draw distance the
amount of items loaded and general
geometry quality at close range does not
change with this setting so here it's
all about choosing a level of tolerance
for pop in ultra high giving by far the
least noticeable pop in while a mode
like high you'll spot objects appearing
out of thin air for a bit as you move
around the busier village areas the good
news is the setting doesn't have a large
impact on performance particularly if
you have a decent amount of VRAM there
is effectively no difference to average
performance and a slight dip to one
Loes when comparing ultra high and high
then medium and especially low give
minor improvements the level of poppy at
medium and low is pretty crazy so I'd
honestly stick to ultra high here and
this you of VRAM or memory performance
are limited texture detail is an obvious
choice as with most games you want to
use the highest possible setting unless
you're running out of video memory for
the resolution you are playing at high
at 4k only allocates a touch over 6
gigabytes on a 28 eti so I suspect most
people with mid to high end graphics
cards will be fine here odyssey's
texture quality setting does have a
larger than usual impact to low textures
look absolutely awful while high is
noticeably sharper than medium and in
general the texture work in this game is
too good to waste so stick to high
unless you have 4 gigabytes of vram or
less and as is the case with most
texture settings there is no significant
impact of performance unless you select
low terrain quality isn't worth
discussing in depth because there's no
difference in performance between high
and medium which are the only two
settings high is slightly superior
visually but with no performance
difference it doesn't really matter just
stick it on high clutter is another
thing that doesn't really impact
performance all that much but it does
impact how dense foliage and other
similar elements are optical grass
density clutter but whatever Ubisoft
ultra has slightly better draw distance
for those elements than medium while low
disables a lot of the grass looking at
performance you'll only start to see a
performance improvement on low which
looks pretty poor so just stick this one
on the maximum setting fog is the
setting that has a very subtle effect in
some areas but has a significant impact
on performance as far as I could tell
there was almost no difference between
high and medium while low appears to
reduce fog density to a minimum level
when looking at performance turning down
fog from high to medium improve frame
rates by 4% on average which is a pretty
large difference considering the visual
change though I should note you only see
this performance improvement in areas
with fog low could also be a decent
option if you want a bit of extra
performance at the expense of basically
removing most of this affect the water
quality setting affects the draw
distance and visibility of objects
beneath the vast ocean surfaces in the
game without noticeably affecting the
quality of the beautiful water
simulation itself there's little
difference
between very high and high but when you
step down to medium deeper parts of the
ocean disappear from view low is like a
boring water mode only showing you
objects at a very close distance again
the performance numbers here relate to
scenes with a lot of water and there's a
nice cadence between each of the
settings are not for high here as it's a
noticeable step up from medium though we
could understand opting for medium if
you want a bit more performance low-end
gamers can use low without completely
destroying the quality of water which is
nice screen space for reflections again
mostly impact the quality of water
surfaces whether that's the ocean or
puddles around the environment SSR
provides a more accurate and realistic
surface reflection simulation and it
really does look fantastic when enabled
especially when you put it side-by-side
with the game running with that SSR
interestingly medium looks pretty close
to off so I don't see any reason to use
the off mode particularly when we look
at the performance impact and there's no
real difference between medium and off
here either turning from high to medium
will give you a two percent performance
improvement but that's not worth it
considering the large visual upgrade
that SSR provides volumetric clouds is
the crazy killer setting in Assassin's
Creed Odyssey turn this setting way up
and watch your framerate
fall to its knees this game does have a
very nice volumetric cloud simulation
especially in stormy conditions but
seriously the performance hit is
ridiculous relative to the visual
difference looking here ultra high does
have more voluminous more detailed
clouds than high but the difference
really isn't that massive and the sky
isn't an area will be focused on for
most of the game medium and especially
low dropped cloud quality further but
seriously look at these performance
differences a whopping 40% improvement
simply from switching volumetric clouds
from ultra high to high and to make
matters crazier this performance Delta
was recorded in the exact scene you saw
earlier which isn't all that visually
impressive and even worse you see very
similar Delta's in area of the game with
only a small portion of the sky in view
so it's well worth turning the Saint
down to gain a ton of performance my
preference to you is to use the high
setting though again medium is a good
option for those on lower tier hardware
on the RT x20 atti at 4k
going from ultra high to high so
frame rates in one section jump from 44
FPS on average to over 60 FPS which is a
mind-boggling difference for such a
small visual downgrade even going from
very high used with the very high preset
Steve benchmark with too high delivers a
large performance improvement in most
areas of the game toning their setting
down is an absolute must for performance
on a much less interesting note Ubisoft
provides a separate quality setting for
character textures as opposed to general
environment textures again this setting
makes very little difference to
performance and high delivers the best
visual quality so stick with high
character quality was a bit of an enigma
I didn't really spot much of a
difference if anything there was a very
slight reduction to the character models
between ultra high and low there wasn't
a significant difference in performance
either though I'd recommend dropping
from ultra high to very high for a
slight gain in MPC dense areas for
basically no visual difference nearly at
the end of this one next up is ambient
occlusion they're sending effects soft
shadowing in the general depth of the
game world with off looking a lot
flatter than any of the three ambient
occlusion modes very high gives the
greatest level of shadowing and the most
realistic depth with high only giving a
small decrease and medium another small
decrease I think high does look slightly
better than medium so I'd recommend
splitting the difference in going with
high though medium is a good choice for
those with less powerful hardware
gaining 2% here for a small quality loss
is a good result
the final setting in the game is depth
of field this one comes into play when
talking to NPCs the quality of the
effect is very high but it's also very
punishing causing a decent drop in frame
rate when instigating a conversation
there isn't any difference between high
and low though so if you like the depth
of field effect I want to keep it
enabled there's no point using low as it
gives no performance improvement and no
visual improvement disabling it could be
a very good option though as you'll see
12 percent better performance when the
effect is active now that all that's
done let's summarize it all and show you
our final custom settings that we
recommend for playing Assassin's Creed
Odyssey as I said earlier the standard
presets aren't great particularly as
very high uses a punishing volumetric
cloud city while missing out on the
superior shadows and draw distances
provided by the ultra high preset high
corrects the volumetric lighting issue
but gives reduced visual quality in a
number of areas so our custom settings
you see here I designed to give as close
to ultra high as possible without the
massive performance hit of that preset
of course the game overall is quite
punishing so for those with mid-range
systems and recommend a few different
settings like dropping shadows to very
high water quality to medium or low
volumetric clouds to medium and ambient
occlusion to medium while maintaining
the other settings where you put our
custom preset beside the ultra high and
high presets you can see we're getting
pretty close to ultra high especially in
terms of shadow quality draw distance is
also much improved as you move
throughout the world and the good news
is we've improved performance by roughly
20 percent with these custom settings
over the ultra-high preset in general
gameplay sometimes much more than that
when a cloud system really ramps up
this puts performance between the very
high and high presets while offering
better visuals with the game this pop
demised that's a huge win for those
struggling for frame rate while this is
great news for those that wanted ultra
quality visuals at better levels of
performance
unfortunately Odyssey doesn't have a lot
of room for reducing quality to get the
game running better on say a GTX 1050 TI
a lot of the settings have very little
performance impact after a certain point
often for large drops in visuals
textures for example look absolutely
terrible on low for basically no
performance uplift environment detail as
well
impacts draw distance and gives a
disappointingly low frame rate uplift on
lower settings overall I feel that
Ubisoft probably could have done a lot
more to get this game running better on
mid-range Hardware having the presets
use a more sensible volumetric cloud
setting would be a start but it would be
great if you could turn down the density
or geometry level of on-screen objects -
I think Louis back gamers would be happy
to sacrifice a few high quality pots and
walls to get this game running better
and this certainly is a very dense game
world here with lots of elements I think
if there was an ability to turn down
some of those elements you could get
better performance on lower tier systems
but you simply can't make that change
with the current array of settings and
as Steve mentioned in his video - I
suspect many of the performance issues
are from trying to do too much with the
current aging game engine that's it for
this look at assassin's creed Odyssey
and all of its graphics settings
hopefully our custom configuration
will you squeeze more out of your system
and cut away some of Ubisoft sport
