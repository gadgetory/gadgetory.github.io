box it's your boy Tim here and we'll be
taking a look today as you can probably
tell from what's in my hands some more
smartphones and on the agenda today the
best budget devices so I've been
recommending Motorola MOTO G phones for
a number of years now and this year
they've come up with the Moto G 5 line
so in this end I lock the motorola moto
G 5 plus and over here the Moto G 5 so
the plus variant is slightly more
expensive it comes with a few extra
features but both phones still sit in
the u.s. 200 to 250 or market making
them really affordable options for those
who don't want to spend hundreds and
hundreds of dollars on the top-tier
devices like the Galaxy s8 motorola has
made a number of improvements to the
Moto G line with the g5 and one of the
key upgrades is the design in past
devices we've gotten a pretty cheap and
crappy feeling plastic construction with
the Moto G 5 and G 5 plus Motorola has
introduced metal for the first time not
just in the premium possible but also in
the more affordable g5 so we're getting
a much nicer design across the board it
feels a lot better in your hands though
it's still not a premium chassis it
still got a bit of plastic around the
edges where some Chinese OMS ago with a
more metal unibody feel and the bezels
on the front of both devices are still
very large so Motorola is still
positioning this device towards more of
the budget end of the spectrum but I
still appreciate the upgrades that
they've made here to introduce things
like metal and a more premium feel the
Moto G 5 plus is the slimmer of the two
devices and it's also slightly larger
with a 5.2 inch display on the front the
Moto G 5 has a 5-inch display on the
front same 1080p resolution but it is
also thicker at more like 10 millimeters
thick as opposed to seven point seven
millimeters in the Moto G 5 plus and the
reason for this is to accommodate the
removable battery this is the only of
the two Moto G 5 devices that comes with
the removable battery and what this
means is that the phone
to be sicker to accommodate some of the
extra housing for that removable battery
assembly taking off the back of this
phone is pretty tough I will have to say
that but underneath the hood you get
that 2800 milliamp hour battery to my
two SIM card slots I should say nano
Sims here and also that micro SD card
slot on the Moto G 5 plus both of those
features are included in a tray that
you'll find on the top edge motorola
hasn't introduced USB type C to the G
line just yet so we're still getting
micro USB on the bottom of both devices
here that does make it a bit cheaper to
purchase accessories and cables but you
know it's the USB type-c revolution at
the moment I hope that a future
iteration of these devices includes that
feature and Motorola isn't a dumb
smartphone company there's a 3.5 mm
headphone jack on the top pretty much
exactly what you want to see here
another good thing about the moto G 5 in
particular is that this is the first G
Series phone that includes a fingerprint
sensor on the front last year's model
the g4 I just the Plus model had a
fingerprint sensor but they've added
that to the cheaper model this time
around it's got a much nicer look and
feel to it as well makes it a bit easier
to operate and of course fingerprint
sensor is still included on the g5 plus
if you wanted to spend a bit more money
another similarity between both devices
is the speaker setup just the single
speaker here included above the display
for both your in court audio and also
your loudspeaker it does go pretty loud
which come can come in handy when you're
on a phone call but the quality isn't
great no stereo audio experiences here
and to be honest you can't really expect
much more from such an affordable
handset both of these budget handsets
pack 1080p IPS LCD s 5.2 inches in the
g5 + and 5 inches in the g5 what
surprised me here is that the display in
the g5 is actually superior to the
display in the g5 plus not only is it
brighter 517 it's and the g5 compared to
500 nits in the g5 plus it also has a
better contrast ratio and better color
accuracy out of the box both of these
phones are configured to use the vibrant
display mode out of the box and on the
g5 plus it's surprisingly inaccurate
relative to the g5 the g5 is much closer
to the ideal color temperature accuracy
as you can
see here in some of our spectracal
charts and also it pulls away in
grayscale color checker and saturation
accuracy whereas on the g5 plus none of
these features are particularly accurate
in fact the g5 compared to some of the
other phones on the market has a pretty
decent display in terms of its color
accuracy also another interesting thing
about these phones is that on the g5 if
you switch from the vibrant to the
standard display mode you will get a
more accurate display on this particular
device but switching over to the g5 plus
making that same change actually makes
the display worse so it's been
interesting that on the more affordable
of the two handsets they've included a
better display it's only a marginal
improvement I will have to say both
phones have very decent displays for a
budget handset but I would like to see
for those that purchase it's been a bit
more money on the g5 plus then they do
get a slightly superior display
experience let's take a look at the
hardware in these devices now starting
with the cheap of the two the Moto G
fives now in last year's model the Moto
G four we saw a Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 1
7 SOC clocked it up to 1.5 gigahertz
across eight CPU cores however in the
Moto G 5 we're seeing a Snapdragon 430
SOC so a downgrade in SOC tear it's a
pretty similar configuration here we're
still getting eight arm cortex a53 CPU
cores there now clocked at 1.4 gigahertz
so a slight downgrade here and we're
seeing an audrina of 505 GPU so again a
very minor downgrade and in my opinion
Motorola has basically done a sideways
move here moving from the 607 to the 430
and that leads to very similar CPU
performance as we'll take a look at in a
moment there are two configurations of
the Moto G 5 one comes with 16 gigabytes
of internal storage and 2 gigabytes of
RAM and a slight upgrade with 32gb of
storage and 3 gigabytes of RAM you get
LTE category for Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g and
answer no AC including this device and
bluetooth 4.2 no NFC either in the
cheaper of the two phones
looking at the Moto G 5 Plus this device
comes with an upgraded SOC compared to
last year's model 2g
plus again used the Snapdragon 600 700
g5 plus we're seeing a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 6 to 5 SOC and again this is
the same octa-core home cortex a53 CPU
design so Motorola loves that octa-core
design but it's now clocked at 2.0
gigahertz all over the GFI plus a pretty
significant clock speed improvement we
also see an adrenal 506 GPU and that
does provide a fairly decent bump in GPU
performance compared to last year's
model there are a range of g5 plus
configuration options available you can
choose between 32 and 64 gigs of
internal storage
there's also either 2 3 or 4 gigabytes
of RAM the configurations there depend
highly on your region that storage
whatever so definitely check what's
available for you my reviewing it was 32
gig and 4 gigabytes of RAM so a pretty
decent configuration there and it's
great to see that you get 32 gig in the
entry-level model for a phone that only
cost 230 bucks pretty decent you'll also
get NFC in some regions definitely check
what's available for you again
LTE category 6 a slight upgrade from the
g5 but you still only are limited to
Wi-Fi ABG and enter no AC and bluetooth
4.2 as well for those of you interested
in smart phone benchmarks we will be
breathing through a number of them for
you here today of course is hardware box
what were we doing if we didn't show
some benchmarks let's get straight into
it and taking a look at the Moto G 5
plus relative to the g5 we are seeing
that 43% higher clock speed on the g5
plus and this translates into 37% more
performance in CPU limited workloads on
average so that does lead to a more
snappy experience in general compared to
last year's more the g5 plus is 38%
faster on average than the g4 plus and
compared to some devices with the oldest
Snapdragon 410 SOC like the G moto g3
the Snapdragon 65 provides 71% more
performance so if you're using a
two-year old budget device which is
snapdragon 410 or 400 inside you see a
pretty significant performance
improvement moving to the g5 plus for
those more interesting the g5 as I
mentioned earlier it's more of a
sideways move here
it's 1% slower than the Moto G 4 in our
cpu workload so that's within the margin
of error and compared to the Snapdragon
410 again if you're moving from an older
budget device 24% more performance in
the g5 so decent-enough upgrade there
move into our GPU benchmarks here and
the Moto G 5 plus is 42% faster than the
Moto G 5 here thanks to that fast
Adrina at 5:06 GPU it also holds a
decent 46 percent lead on the Moto G 4
plus which was another 1080p handset
while it obliterates all the Snapdragon
410 SOC s that SOC is more designed for
720p display so not a big surprise here
moto g5 buyers shouldn't despair because
the Snapdragon 430 SOC is a capable
associate of 1080p displays unlike some
of the older 400 series chips the g5 is
more than three times as fast as
Snapdragon 410 handsets however it loses
to the Moto G for last year's model by
approximately 6% on average not a big
deal here and both of these hazards are
still capable of playing to those
popular smartphone games in terms of
NAND performance this is another area
where it was surprising to see the Moto
G 5 have a performance edge on the g5
plus the 16 gigabytes of NAND in my
reviewing it was around 28% faster than
the g5 plusses 32 gigabytes of man
though both phones perform pretty well
in this regard for an entry-level
handset in terms of battery life the
Moto G 5 has a 2800 milliamp hour
removable battery the g5 plus it's a bit
slimmer but packs a 3000 milliamp hour
non removable battery so it's 7 percent
larger than the g5 it also uses a more
efficient manufacturing node for the SOC
inside 14 nanometers for the g5 + 28
nanometers on the g5 and that produces a
more efficient SOC that can last a bit
longer in our battery tests as we will
care through some of our tests the g5
plus is a fantastic performer across the
board producing very solid results for a
mid-range phone and despite the fact
that it packs the same battery capacity
as last year's g4 plus it actually
outperforms the g4 plus by significant
margin thanks
to that more efficient SOC the g5 does
fall a bit behind the g5 plus although
that's not surprising considering it has
a smaller battery the less efficient SOC
there's still very solid results for the
g5 across our tests here and it does
outperform some of the previous models
from motor rollers G series if you've
managed to get through this far into the
review you'll probably notice I've been
pretty positive so far but there is one
area from both devices that has
unfortunately regrets compared to last
year you might have guessed it it is the
camera the one area I haven't talked
about just yet motorola has been talking
up the camera in the g5 plus in
particular because they're very proud of
how they've included a 12 megapixel
sensor with dual pixel technology the
same sensor used in the Samsung Galaxy
s7 so you should be expecting pretty
good photos from this camera right well
unfortunately Motorola hasn't put a lot
of time and effort into the processing
and that leads to pretty disappointing
results here when you take a look at
some photos things like contrast dynamic
range color saturation metering and so
forth all for behind the galaxy s7
because the s7 uses superior processing
there are some areas where the g5 plus
is superior to last year's g4 plus such
as in his low-light performance this
camera has larger internal pixels so you
get a brighter experience there and the
focusing times thanks to which dual
pixel face detection autofocus is
significantly faster than last year's
model but I actually think the g4 plus
delivers better photos across the board
and that's disappointing because this
camera does have a better sensor in it
the g5 plus should produce better fires
but it simply doesn't and that's a bit
disappointing that said its detail is
one area where it does take the edge
over the galaxy s7 you get pretty decent
detail from an entry-level phone here in
terms of the Moto g5 we're seeing
another regression this time compared to
the Moto G for play the ultra cheap
phone from last year it's a 13 megapixel
sensor in this camera
but again Motorola hasn't focused too
deeply on the cameras processing and
this leads to pretty mediocre results
across the board and is prone a little
bit to washing out and it's inside
results when you're indoors on
artificial life and it's low-light
performance is nothing special
whatsoever
so again disappointing because the Moto
G for play was a very capable camera for
such a cheap price and I wish that
Motorola would have spent a bit more
time optimizing some of the processing
in these two phones you get a very
similar camera app in both the g5 and
the g5 plus not particularly great not a
whole ton of features there the Moto G 5
plus is the only phone of the two that
supports 4k capture I get this is
actually a pretty decent feature
consumer we haven't seen that before in
the Moto G line you're restricted to
just 1080p capture in the murder of g5
and in terms of their selfie cameras
both are five megapixel units with an F
2.2 lens decent results here nothing too
amazing and again it leads to a pretty
average camera experience for both of
these entry-level phones I'm not going
to talk too much about the software on
these handsets because both run stock
Android 7.0 out of the box got familiar
with stock Android you'll love the
experience provided here there are a few
minor tweaks here and there there's
nothing that significantly impacts the
experience when I asked Motorola about
the software updates for these handsets
they did say they're planning on
producing quarterly upgrades this is
mostly due to carrier and regulator
restrictions in some regions they simply
can't push it out faster than that so be
disappointed not seeing monthly upgrades
and both of these devices only come with
this January security upgrades out of
the box it's May now I'd really like to
see a more updated handset here so I'll
have to wait and see what Motorola's
track record is in delivering those
promised quarterly upgrades the main
selling point for the Moto G 5 1 if that
brings all this great hardware and
features and performance into such an
affordable price point for those of you
in the United States the Moto G 5 plus
retails for just 230 US dollars which is
an absolute bargain for what you get in
my opinion is also $20 cheaper than last
year's Moto G 4 plus and you can save
even more money if you're willing to put
up with Amazon lockscreen ads for what
you get in this phone even considering
that regressed camera compared to the g4
plus I still think it's a really solid
buy added
price point unfortunately the Moto g5
isn't available in the United States but
you will find it in other regions like
Europe for 200 euros or in Australia for
just $300 u.s. at that price book you
get such a great experience in terms of
its performance and battery life it's
really hard to pass up at that price
however if you are willing to spend a
bit more money in Australia $400 use for
the Moto G 5 plus you get a bit better
performance a bit better camera and a
bit better battery life at that price
point it can make it a bit of a
compelling option if you have a bit more
money to spend but at 300 bucks really
it's hard to pass up the Moto G 5 and
Motorola has really hit the nail on the
head once again with their budget
smartphone offerings for 2017 anyway
