the video description there's a few days
left of the competition so you still
have time to enter and this is a global
giveaway so we're willing to ship this
thing anywhere I am splitting the
shipping cost 50/50 with Brian from
techie cities and that'll make it a bit
easier if we have to send it to the
other side of the world and we will be
doing another giveaway next month as
well so I'll be able to repeat the
process all over again and give you guys
the chance for another full system there

video description there's also a few
runner-up prizes are an msi be 350

motherboard there and an eight out of

another video soon that'll include
things like overclocking and a bit of
gameplay but you know we are running out
of time now is only a few days left of
the competition so that may not happen
