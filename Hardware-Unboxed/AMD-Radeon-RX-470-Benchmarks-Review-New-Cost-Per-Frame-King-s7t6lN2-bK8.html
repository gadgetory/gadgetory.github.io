Thermaltake Corp III in partnership with
Thermaltake I'm giving away three of
these beautiful awesome cases to enter
sign up at our former hardware and box
comm post a picture of your current rig
your specs and quickly tell me what you
want to do with the core p3 good luck
and enjoy the video the time has come to
benchmark the new Radian rx4 70 and
benchmark Ãªtre shell for those of you
expecting some twenty plus games tested
I've got to apologize you'll have to
stand off a dozen this time around
unfortunately I only found out the RX
470 was incoming late last week in my
sample arrived less than 24 hours before
the deadline the good news though was
because I did have almost a week's
notice that the RX 470 was being
released today I was able to do a bit of
planning which resulted in quite a bit
of pre testing the key part of the plan
was to change my test system for these
lower end / mid-range graphics cards to
something that would closer reflect the
setups those shopping for a sub $200 GPU
would be running this meant dumping the
overclocked core i7 6700 K system for a
more affordable core i3 rig in the end I
went with a core i3 6100 T which is
roughly three times cheaper than the
6700 K a deliberately Optive the low
voltage model as it comes clocked to
just 3.2 gigahertz will better reflect
the performance of locked processors
typically graphics cards benchmarked
using high-end rigs to avoid system
bottlenecks and this makes a lot of
sense that said for this review I wanted
to try doing things a little different
to the norm
after all you're going to see khalasar
x4 70 reviews go live alongside mine and
the vast majority will no doubt feature
a core i7 test rig
additionally the response to my video
where I tested the RX 480 and gtx 1060
on six-year-old AMD and intel computers
was very well received so with almost
wake up my sleeve i took 9 graphics
cards in the sub $300 price range and
tested them at 1080p that doesn't new
and relatively new triple-a titles now
that we have the RX 470 on hand will be
interesting to see how it compares for
more information regarding the RX 470
please check out the AMD radeon RX 460
and RX 470 preview video I put together
last week enough video I speculated the
RX 470 would cost 180 dollars
despite almost all news reports claiming
a $150 price
quite a few of you guys failed the RX
470 would come in at $150 but frankly I
couldn't see it happening I'm not
expecting this new GPU to be much slower
than the rx 480 and 150 dollars the RX
470 wouldn't just be the buy of the year
would also have heavily cannibalize the
our X 480 sales the $180 us MSRP means
down under the RX 470 should cost around
240 dollars based on a rough currency
conversion that said the cheapest price
the RX for it is being advertised for in
Australia is 360 dollars while you still
have to pay four hundred and forty
dollars to find one in stock based on
that information I expect the cheapest
RX 470 will cost us Aziz around 320
bucks which is roughly what I paid a few
days ago for the i-93 ATX used for
comparison in this video all graphics
cards tested a reference models and
those that aren't have had their BIOS
reflash to meet the reference clock
speeds AMD provided the a cor x4 70
Strix Edition for review which does
feature a decent factory overclock so
for the purposes of this review I've
down clocked the Asus card to the
reference clock frequencies to keep the
results fair for that reason I haven't
included overclocking in this video and
instead at a later date I'll do a full
review of this tricks edition to provide
factory and custom overclocking results
ok so that gets the important stuff out
of the way let's get to the results
shall we will begin our benchmarks with
Batman Arkham Knight here you can see
the 470 managed to healthy 85 FPS
meaning it was within 7% of its bigger
brother the RX 480
this is one of the few titles to where
the RX 4 idea was ahead of the 1060 and
as a result the 470 was within 6 percent
of the Nvidia card compared to the 380
acts of the previous generation we're
now looking at a card that's 10 FPS
faster again the 470 performed extremely
well this time in black ops 3 here it
was good for 92 fps making it just 3 FPS
shy of the 480
this time however the 1060 was more true
to its average relative performance and
was 12% faster at 105 fps this is the
game with a 470 layers biggest beating
on the 380 acts of yesteryear trouncing
it by 23% our doom tests were conducted
using Vulcan and here the four seventies
performance was rather impressive was
able to eclipse the much more expensive
gtx 1060 by 4 FPS but was 15% behind the
RX 480 and the 390 this time the 380
acts again trailed behind this time by
20%
next up was Far Cry primal and here the
470 was within three frames the 480
under these conditions which was obvious
pretty negligible whatsoever 15% slower
than the 1060 although both cars
provided very smooth gaming experiences
in shadow of Mordor the 480 was able to
extend its lead again this time out of
14 percent the 1060 was also 18 FPS
ahead meaning the 470 was 20% slower in
Mirror's Edge catalyst on the medium
quality setting is were able to extract
a smooth 74 FPS on the RX 470 this was
quite close to the performance of the
480 which was only for FPS ahead on 78
the 1060 led the pack again and this
time the 470 was 21% slower the stronger
cards in our testing pack were possibly
reaching a CPU bottleneck here and
overwatch on the ultra quality setting
here the 1060 480 and for 70 well within
4 frames of each other and the 380 X was
7% behind the 470 specifically we tested
rise of the Tomb Raider in DirectX 12
with the very high quality settings the
470 managed to smooth 84 FPS which was
great to see this was 15% faster than
380 X and temps and behind the our X 480
Star Wars Battlefront was an interesting
one here the top three cards all seem to
hit the same bottleneck at 107 fps and
the 470 was 18% behind on 88 fps the 380
X though was even further behind at 79
in the division the 470 was slightly
faster than the much more power hungry
r9 390 with 68f yes it was 12% slower
than his bigger brother from the same
generation and 14% behind the mid-range
and more expensive 1060 from the green
team The Witcher 3 was one of the games
where the 470 was quite close to the 480
this time to 7% behind was also in the
11% slower than the 1060 which is a good
showing compared with some of the last
generations cards it smoked the 1060 by
50% and was 17 percent faster than 380 X
this time I tested total war Warhammer
and DirectX 12 and the i9 390 was king
of the hill the margins weren't huge
though on the 470 fell only 2 FPS behind
the RX 480 and 3 FPS behind the 1060 the
380 and 380 X were all in the same
ballpark too though with 59 and 60 FPS
respectively the total system power
consumption on average over 20 minutes
of gameplay at 1080p was a relatively
low 201 watts this was 17 watts less
than the R X 480 reference card which
seems about spot-on based on the
performance as mentioned the RX 470
we're using here is of the asus strix
variety whereas the RX 480 is only the
honestly pretty poorly cooled reference
card the results speak for themselves
a Sioux seemed to have devised a pretty
damn effective cooler and as you can see
after 20 minutes of gameplay it was
still sitting at a comparatively icy
cool 59 degrees this is compared to a
coffee brewing 81 degrees from the 480
reference card and 71 degrees from the
GTX 1060 founders edition interesting
results for sure but I've got to say
that they're quite in line with what I
was expecting based on the
specifications we had before I finally
got the card and was able to test it the
power consumption is low but also in
line with the performance scene the
temperatures maintained by the Strix
card are actually really impressive now
let's jump into the part of the review I
personally find most interesting and
useful the direct card comparisons in a
direct comparison with the rx 380 here
you can see it was on average 20% faster
at 1080p there's quite a spread of
results they were ranging quite steadily
from 5% all the way up to 35% I was
really interested to see how the 380 x
and 4 70 stacked up was there two cards
from different generations that feature
the exact same core configuration as you
can see the new polaris card is 13%
faster on average through our dozen
games tested and again there's quite a
spread of results in our total war
DirectX 12 test the cards were only
separated by 2% whereas in black ops 3
the 470 was able to pull away by 23%
obviously this is another comparison
that I'm most likely you are very
interested to see compared directly to
the rx 480 reference card the 470 was an
average on the APUs and slower as I
thought it might be due to our testing
conditions there are a couple of games
or assistant bottleneck was present this
is why overwatch for instance was within
1% this 8% average however is why I knew
this card wouldn't be coming in at a
price as low as 150 u.s. dollars the new
rx 470 put a fair beating on the gtx 960
and at its closest it was still 19%
ahead on average though it was a
whopping 42 percent faster meaning the
470 would be a significant upgrade for
gtx 960 users these cards are really in
totally different price categories but
it was interesting to see that in a
number of titles the difference when
paired with the lower end processor was
quite small in a third of our games
tested the RX 470 was only 6 percent
slower or less and in the case of doom
running in Vulcan was actually faster
this meant that overall the average was
12% slower and the largest margin was in
rise of the Tomb Raider whether 470 was
24% slower than the 1060 AMD of pitching
the rx force
is the perfect 1080p gaming solution and
having seen an average of 88 fps over
our 12 games tested I'd have to agree
coming into the class per frame just two
dollars and five cents the RX 470 is now
the new cost per frame King and at 1080p
it looks like there's no better buy
these figures might look slightly
different with a higher-end CPU as in a
couple of games there was a system
bottleneck present but these instances
were kind of insignificant because
performance was already well over 100
FPS the 380 acts was next best in terms
of cost per frame but the new 470 still
wiped the floor with the saving of 29
cents per frame so unless availability
for the 470 is shocking you use a high
refresh rate monitor or there's a large
price discrepancy in your region for
1080p gaming it seems like there'll be
no better choice than AMD's new rx 470
