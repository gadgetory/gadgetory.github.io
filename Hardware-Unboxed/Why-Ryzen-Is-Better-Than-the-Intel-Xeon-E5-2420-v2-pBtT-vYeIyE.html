you've probably seen thumbnails just
like the one on this video $24 Eon $18
Eon and so on these videos push cheap
Xeon CPUs as the Holy Grail even going
as far as to call them rise on
alternatives but is using these cheap
server CPUs for gaming and Protima T
tasks of wires choice are they really
all they're cracked up to be
well today we're going to find out but
before that this video is brought to you
by MSI and their new and upgraded
workstation laptops the MSI WS 65 in
particular is one that caught my
attention combining the excellent slim
and light aesthetics of their gaming
laptops with brand-new NVIDIA Quadro RT
X 5000 graphics for professionals on the
go that demand top in performance the ws
65 also packs up to Intel Core I nine
processors loads of RAM a 4k display and
even a fingerprint scanner for added
security to learn more click the links
in the description below in the past
think pre Rison past
I myself have on occasion got excited
about cheap x79 Xeon CPUs for example
back in 2016 I built an entire 16 core
32 threads xeon monster pc for less than
the price of a flagship core i7
processor it really was a great value PC
back then today though it's rather
embarrassing and I certainly wouldn't
recommend you waste your time and money
on such a build but what about really
cheap Zeon's
like the e5 2420 v2 or the 2430 v2 these
are ivory bridge bass parts packing six
cores clocked at a reasonable frequency
well above 2 gigahertz anyway the e5
2424 example comes clocked at 2.2
gigahertz for the base and it will clock
up to 2.7 gigahertz for the boost it
packs a 15 megabyte l3 cache and right
now can be had for around $18 u.s. as
the thumbnail says or in my local
currency about $30 readers so you're
getting a 6 quart 12 thread CPU that
just about clocks up to three years
based on the ivory Bridge arc
for $18 us hell yeah
sign me up unfortunately the old adage
if it sounds too good to be true it
probably is very much applies here the
catchy being that sandy bridge-e N and
Ivybridge e'en xeon processors use the
LGA 1356 socket and this really limits
the selection of motherboards you have
to choose from as the LGA 1356 and LGA
1366 sockets are in no way compatible
with one another so essentially what we
have here is a budget version of the LGA
2011 socket and it features half as many
quickpath interconnect almost half as
many PCIe lanes while the memory
channels have been cut down from 4 to 3
this means while you can throw on LGA
1366 xeon on a desktop x58 motherboard
this isn't an option for these
particular Ivy Bridge Xeon CPUs that
we'll be looking at today getting back
to the LGA 1356 motherboards what are
the options in short nothing but junk
junk and more junk the board being
recommended in this great value Xeon
deal is some kind of Chinese hybrid
knockoff thing it's called the x79 1356
oh cool you get an ex 79 chipset well
you'd think so given the name but yeah
no not the case rather it uses Intel's
b65 chipset yeah Intel's business class
6 series chipset this means you get just
2 dims you're also limited to the USB
2.0 spec 6 SATA ports though with this
board you're only getting 3 and then
there's a maximum of 8 pcie 2.0 lanes
hanging off the chipset the board packs
a horrible looking for phase varium
though it should be fine for these lower
clocked rather efficient server chips
and then finally thrown in as a basic
Realtek Gigabit Ethernet controller and
a super low-end Realtek ALC 662 audio
codec that all sounds pretty ugly but
this is meant to be an ultra budget
solution so it probably only cost $20
maybe $30 wrong its $54 u.s. and it
hurts me to even say that I was stunned
$92 Aussie including delivery to the
or from the recommended Aliexpress
cellar couple that with the xeon e5 2420
v2 and I've now spent 122 dollars
Australian I guess for a 6-quart 1200
Ivy Bridge processor that's not too bad
but as you're about to see it's far from
good next up I needed some ddr3 memory
you can get ECC memory pretty cheap I've
seen 16 gigabyte kits selling for as
little as forty dollars so that brings
our total up to one hundred and sixty
two dollars Ozzie and that doesn't seem
too bad for a CPU motherboard and memory
package in fact I'd argue the CPU memory
is actually rather good the problem is
once again the motherboard it's just
bloody awful the BIOS is horrible
it's extremely basic and novice builders
will have a hard time working out what's
what especially if they've only been
playing around with PC building for a
few years the BIOS really took me back
although I couldn't really enjoy the
moment of nostalgia as there really
wasn't much I could do you can't really
overclock anything because you know it's
a b65 chipset you can't even chew in the
memory timings we're still the first few
sticks of ddr3 memory that I tried and I
know these memory sticks work completely
fine they booted up on the board they
loaded into Windows but then the second
I hit the log on screen they blue
screened and reset it wasn't until I got
to my fourth set of ddr3 memory sticks
that I was able to find something that
worked and it was a 16 gigabyte kit of
ddr3 1600 and it was able to run at that
1600 speed on this board so at least
there's that
before we get into the benchmarks though
I thought to myself okay this is clearly
a garbage solution but can we do any
better without any one-time deals I feel
like that's gonna be hard but I feel
like for not much more we shoot out
against something that's significantly
better what I was able to land myself
was a Rison v 1400 for 117 dollars the
asrock a B 350 M Pro for refurbished for
just fifty seven dollars and eight
gigabytes a reasonably good ddr4 3000
memory for $52 the total was two hundred
and twenty six dollars Aussie and yeah
that is $64 ooh do is more about $43
u.s. and that's not a lot really and I'm
certain it's going to be worth the extra
investment also us-based viewers can do
significantly better than
what I've done here and we might talk
about that towards the end of the video
for now let's see how this is Aeon and
rise and build compares in a few blue
bar graphs there isin five 1,400 and
1,600 were tested using CL 16 memory
while the 2600 X is using a lower
latency cell 14 memory then for the xeon
build I've set the ddr3 memory speed to
1600 and remember I can't change any of
the memory timings so I just got testing
speaking of which all testing has been
conducted with a GeForce r-tx 20 ATT I
installed as always we do this to remove
any bottlenecks when testing CPU
performance and testing will be
conducted turn EP and 1440 pay for the
gaming benchmarks but we also have a few
quick application tests as well so let's
get into it
okay so first up we have Cinebench our
20s multi-core tests and right away we
see the difficult tasks that the lowly
clocked 6 core Xeon CPU has ahead
scoring just twelve hundred and seventy
six points meant that the Rison 5 1400
was 21% faster while the six core Rison
cpu of the same generation was 95%
faster the big issue here though for the
xeon processor is the single core
performance you know that thing first
and second generation cpu struggle with
well relative to the sub 3 gigahertz
xeon cpu there's really no issue here
with rising at all there are 5 1400 was
73% faster and that's obviously no small
difference as i'm sure you are aware
anyway moving on to sevens if we see for
compression work the r5 1400 and see on
processor a quite evenly matched the r5
1400 was just 4% faster while the r5
1600 was 50% faster but when it comes to
decompression work the r5 1400 was 14%
faster not a massive difference but the
higher clocked quad-core SMT enabled
rise in process or was clearly faster in
this test but what if you want to do
some video production work on your
budget build
well if that's what you're after you'll
still be much better off with the rising
5 processor here the r5 1400 was 20%
faster than the e5 2420 v2 while the r5
1600 with 71% faster then lastly for the
application testing we have blender and
here the r5 1400 was 9% faster again not
a massive difference but the rising fire
processor was still clearly faster then
we see once again for a massive
performance upgrade you can get the r5
1600 for 77% more performance in this
application as you might have expected
though the Xeon processor is at least
very efficient pushing total system
consumption to just 91 watts so this is
why the Chinese knockoff motherboard
thing can get away with that ugly 4
phase vrm total system assumption is 35
percent higher with the r5 1400 but at
well under 150 watts I doubt this will
present as an issue out of interest I
did some USB 3 benchmarking and this is
how the recommended LGA 1356 motherboard
compares to budget I am for alternatives
USB performance might not be an issue
for everyone who's looking at buying a
budget PC but I know myself if I was
stuck on a system capable of just 30
megabytes per second and it drives me
absolutely insane
I should just quickly note there is a
Chinese knockoff board that does offer
some USB 3 ports but it is more
expensive again that's that I have seen
them on sale for around $75 but even
then that's more than what I paid for
the be 350 board which natively supports
about half a dozen actually more than
half a dozen USB 3 spec ports including
a USB 3.1 type-c and finally I should
note that you can add USB 3.0 to any
motherboard with a spare PCIe x 1 slot
but you have to spend about another $10
to do so okay time for some gaming
benchmarks are first that we have
Assassin's Creed Odyssey tested at 1080p
using the higher quality preset though
we will check out the 1440p results in a
moment
so here the r5 1400 is 25% faster for
the average framerate and 31% faster
when comparing the 1% low results that's
a pretty big difference really and
what's more interesting to note is that
the upgrade from the 1400 to the 1600
will net you an additional 33 percent
performance in this title moving to
1440p and we're still heavily CPU bound
with the r5 1485 2420 v2 so this means
the Rison 5 processor was still 25%
faster in Assassin's Creed Odyssey
that's obviously a significant
performance increase and I should just
mention that you can still overclock the
Rison processor for a reasonable boost
in performance but
talk more about this towards the end of
the video we know battlefield 5 maxes
out modern quad-core processors say the
r5 1400 does struggle a little in this
title that said the six core Xeon was
really no better slightly better one
percent low performance at 1080p so the
smoothness factor was about the same for
the r5 1400 though the Rison processor
did average 23% more frames and again I
should just note for a significant
performance upgrade here you do have the
option of getting the r5 1600 at 1440p
the r5 1400 and xeon processors were
pretty similar in terms of their
smoothness but again the game was
noticeably better on the horizon
processor thanks to often much higher
for home rates again though for a
flawless experience you really need
something like the r5 1600 or better
moving on we have shut off the Tomb
Raider and here the r5 1400 was 17%
faster on average and 46% faster for the
one percent low result again another
massive win here for first generation
processor and once again I should just
quickly note that the r5 1400 is very
slow relative to the r5 1600 so
potentially another nice upgrade option
there and we see basically the same
thing when gaming at 1440p due to the
fact that we're so heavily cpu-bound in
this title with these lower end
processors so you'd see similar margins
with something like a gtx 1070 for
example here we set the r5 1400 is over
30% faster when playing the division 2
and while the xeon cpu did enable
playable performance the experience was
significantly better with the rise in
processor this was also true at 1440p
here the 1% low performance was only
improved by 15% with the r5 1400 but
that was still enough to make a
noticeable difference that and the
almost 30% boosts the average framerate
farcry new dawn is another game that was
perfectly playable in the e5 2420 v2 but
for a small price premium the r5 1400 is
almost 30% faster and doesn't come with
a long list of cons the r5 1400 was also
noticeably more powerful at 1440p and
was 20% faster we're looking at the 1%
low data World War Z really isn't that
demanding on the CPU and here the Xeon
processor pushed at a
very respectable 103 FPS an average with
a 1% low of 84 FPS so that really is
excellent performance the r5 1400 was
still 20% faster on average but here it
doesn't really matter too much
so when cpu performance isn't at a
premium for gaming the old Zeon's do
pretty well who would have thought and
rage too is another example of this well
sort of this is a bit of an odd title
because although the average frame rate
is almost always around the 140 to 160
FPS mark regardless of the CPU used the
one percent low figure can vary quite
massively of course this is where the
CPU has the most impact but generally
you'd expect some kind of drop-off for
the average framerate as well something
else that's interesting to note at 1080p
the r5 1400 was 21% faster for the one
percent low but as we move to the more
demanding 1440p resolution that margin
blows out to 48 percent and I saw this
repeatedly when testing you'd normally
expect to see the opposite at a higher
resolution the game should become more
GPU bound but here it creates an
additional load that the xeon processor
just doesn't seem to be out of handle we
know hitman 2 to be a very cpu demanding
title and here the e5 2420 v2 tanks
pretty heavily at 1080p the r5 1400 was
34% faster and average and 43% faster
for the 1% low figure probably enough
said there really
the margins remained much the same at
1440p as well and again we see the
average frame rate of the xeon processor
full short of the r5 1400s 1% lower
result wrapping up the gaming benchmarks
is total war three kingdoms and here the
r5 1400 was 21 percent faster now
average and 15% faster for the 1% low
the margins were fairly similar at 1440p
though again we see the Xeon processors
struggling with its 1% low performance
at the higher resolution so that's
pretty interesting but I think at this
point you've probably seen enough data
so that's gonna do it for the gaming and
application benchmarks now I know some
will object to me using an RT X 20 atti
claiming a lower end GPU makes more
sense for these budget builds but I'm
not really interested in masking CPU
perform it's in an effort to try and
make the Xeon look more palatable and
frankly performance really isn't the
biggest decider here the point is the
Xeon
'if I've 2420 v2 isn't more powerful
than our eysan v 1400 in fact for the
most part it is quite a bit slower and a
quick Cinebench run proves this in my
opinion it's quite clear that aim B's
rise in v is the superior cpu in terms
of performance there's really no
questioning that at least from my point
of view and you can forget about how
many cores you think a game requires the
Rison v 1400 is superior period it's not
a great deal more expensive either sure
it does cost a little bit more but given
what you get
can you really justify saving less than
$100 Australian with the outdated Xeon
and again I just I really want to
highlight that this comparison goes so
far beyond just performance the quality
of your average be 350 motherboard is
head and shoulders above what you get
with these cheap Chinese LGA 1356 boards
the BIOS alone is worth paying more for
but on top of that you get modern
features you know USB 3.0 M 2 ports more
SATA ports more DIMM slots better
quality audio and networking more
expansion slots and really the list does
just go on then on top of all of that
you rise and upgrade options are vast
the xeon e5 2420 v2 is really it I mean
you can get the xeon e5 2430 v2 for a
few hundred extra megahertz but that's
it meanwhile the Rison v 1400 can be
upgraded to something like the r5 1600
or 2600 that we saw in this video or you
can get an 8 core model or even an
upcoming Xen 2 processor for who knows
how much more performance point is you
have options and really a lot of them
and for that reason alone the second
hammer Eisen built just seems to be like
a significantly wiser investment and
just because something doesn't cost much
money doesn't make it cheap and it
certainly doesn't make it good value for
something to be defined as cheap it not
only has to be low in price but rather
low in price relative to similar items
or services the Xeon bill just isn't
cheap sitting next to the Rison v 1400
it's poor value and I'm shocked anyone
would actually wreck
if the Zeon build was around $50 Ozzy
sure I probably get a bit excited about
it but for over a hundred and fifty
dollars are you kidding me also
something else I hadn't accounted for is
the cooler you can get the risin 5 1400
with the Box cooler delivered for one
hundred and twenty two dollars so that's
five dollars Ozzy extra for the zone
you'll need to buy an LGA 1366 or 2011
socket cooler they really aren't hard to
find an out terribly expensive but you
will have to spend at least another ten
dollars not a big deal but it does take
the Rison option from 40 percent more
expensive down to 34 percent more
expensive so every dollar really does
count here alternatively though if you
really want to save every last dollar on
the rise and build you can get an a320
motherboard though it kind of pains me
to say so they sell locally for just
twenty to thirty dollars Australian so
they're probably just about giving them
away in the u.s. honestly though I'd
strongly recommend avoiding an a320
board you can't overclock on them and
they won't support sin to processors but
an r5 1400 on an a320 board is still
much better than their xeon option
there's also the overclocking angle for
the r5 1400 which I didn't even bother
exploring for this video I didn't want
to risk inflating the issue for me it's
pretty clear the rise in processor is a
significantly wiser investment and
overclocked r5 1400 results are out
there anyway but in short you can
extract at least another 20% performance
with a simple multiplier overclock so in
summary the Rison 5 option yeah it's a
little more expensive you do have to
make a slightly larger initial
investment but once you do the benefits
are well worth it not only do you get a
much faster PC packing loads more
features but you get a vast and very
cost effective upgrade path I think
that's really going to do it for this
one I think we've covered pretty well
everything I think it's pretty clear
what the better buy is here and yeah
what you should do but anyway as always
I'm really interested to hear what you
guys think about these cheap Z on videos
and CPUs like this guy here worth it
because of well the motherboards that
you end up getting stuck with yeah
anyway very interested to hear what you
guys think
yeah that's gonna do it for this one if
you liked the video like it
please that'll be much appreciated you
can subscribe for more content and if
you appreciate us here at harbor unbox
our doing what we do then you can
support us directly on patreon you'll
get access to our discord chat where you
can talk about things like this with us
directly quite a few patreon members
actually pushed us to make this video
which is one of the reasons why we
invested some patreon money in that
silly motherboard
any way you can yeah get access to our
discord chat monthly live streams then
it's a whole lot of fun yeah thank you
for watching I'm your host Steve and
I'll see you again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
