unboxed now before I get into this video
let's just adjust any expectations you
might have and let me say that this is
not a rising benchmark video
unfortunately that is still coming and
you won't have to wait too long for it
but yeah not today still that is not
stopping AMG from creating even more
hype if that's even possible at this
point if you type the word rising into
the youtube search you'll be hit with
page after page of clickbait tales and
highly speculative videos based on
guesswork or leaks flash made up
information some of it has been fun
though and some of it has been quite
accurate but a lot of it is just filled
a slow news week so while we can't bring
you the benchmarks yet and I know that's
all you guys really want to see at this
point at least we can set the record
straight okay so one figure which has
been floating around since mid 2015 or
thereabouts-- has been that then now
known as rising will offer a forty
percent bump for instructions per clock
when compared to excavator for those of
you unaware excavator is the latest and
most refined version of the original
bulldozer architecture this claim was of
course originally made by AMD and it was
repeated just a few months ago in a
keynote titled a path to them many had
seer eyes that a forty percent
improvement would still see AMD fall
quite short of Intel's latest skylake
and kb lekha architectures and would
even put them a reasonable margin behind
broadwell well prepare to recalculate as
AMD is now stating IPC gains of more
than fifty two percent when compared to
excavator more than fifty two percent
well of course that is according to AMD
but given what they have shown us so far
I'm not a little skeptical about the
claim I'm also sure that many of you
have already seen the leaked information
for the horizon three five and seven
series processors the leaks have been
well documented I can confirm at least
at this point of the information for the
horizon 7 desktop processors is correct
and they will be launched globally on
March second right now Andy is taking
pre-orders from more than 180 global eat
eilers and boutique OEMs anyway the
risin series will include the 1800 x
1700 x
and 1700 all of which are eight cause 16
threaded processes with a whopping great
16 megabyte level three cash also these
processes will comprise of over 4.8
billion transistors the leaks pricing
information was also very accurate the
horizon 7 1800 x will set you back $500
us passed out of the 16 okay the 1700 x
is a good bit cheaper at four hundred
dollars us and is therefore priced
alongside the 6800 k and finally the
vanilla 1700 model will sell for just
three hundred and thirty dollars us
which makes it slightly cheaper than the
7700 k interestingly AMD has made a bold
claim that the horizon 7 series will
offer the fastest eight core desktop
processors on the market very bold claim
indeed and I'm keen to verify if this is
true or not very shortly backing up
those claims AMD showed the flagship
rise in seven 1800 x outperforming a
similarly configured eight course 16
threat Intel Core i7 69 or ek system in
the Cinebench r15 multi-threaded test a
handbrake based video transcoding test
and also showed comparable 4k gaming
performance the 1800 x which is a
flagship model as i just mentioned comes
clocked at 3.6 gigahertz with a turbo
boost frequency of 4 gigahertz and this
is a 95 watt TDP part out of the box
that was shown to be scoring 16 hundred
and nineteen point since an adventure
our sixteens multi-threaded test which
is an impressive score given my stock
core i7 6950 x which is a 10 called 20
thread processor scores just over 1,800
points however more relevant is the 6900
k which features the same core and a
thread count it scores just shy of 1,600
points in my chest without any other
clocking that says their AMD did show a
score of 14 hundred and seventy four
points for the 6900 k but in any case
the intel processor cost twice as much
at best delivers similar performance
then we have these 1700 x which comes
clocked at a base frequency of 3.4
gigahertz with a turbo boost speed of
3.8 gigahertz and again this is another
95 watt TDP part AMD showed this process
of producing a multi-threaded Cinebench
r15 score of 15 hundred and thirty seven
points while the 6900 KN air test was
good for fourteen hundred and seventy
four points and the 6800 k just 11
hundred and eight points
1700 x also produced the same 162 point
single-threaded score as the 1600 k so
based on this the four hundred dollar
1700 x should perform roughly on par
with the 1050 dollar 1600 k while
dusting the 430 dollar 6800 k finally
the 1700 the non ex model is a 65 watt
TDP part that comes clocked at three
gigahertz for the base and 3.7 gigahertz
for the turbo frequency it scored
fourteen hundred and ten points in the
center bench r15 test which is quite a
bit better than the 7700 k which scored
just shy of 1,000 points in it out of
the box configuration and II will also
launch the fancy looking rape spire a
new cooling solution for select rise and
processes anyway for today's soft to
launch because that's essentially what
it is at the soft launch we're giving
some details for a couple of the
higher-end processes there also is some
useful or interesting cinebench schools
included but more importantly we have
stuff like the operating frequencies and
pricing while it was very nice to see
some confirmed Cinebench r15 results and
i'm sure with just one week to go before
the release or thereabout aimed II won't
be misleading us with any numbers we
don't have to longs to get any claims at
this point the confirm pricing info was
also great and I can't wait to see how
Intel or acts to all with well that's
pretty much it for now I know these
teaser type videos are getting a bit
painful at this point but like I said at
least we could confirm a few things even
if they were all pretty well sauce yeah
at this point I'm your host Steve stay
tuned don't go anywhere I'm serious
don't go anywhere separately you can
daddy
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
