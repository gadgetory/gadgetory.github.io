have another amazing modern system from
alex and this time is building in the
cooler master cosmos 2 and this is a
thread rip in 1950 ex build anyway
enough for me I'll hand it over to Alex
to tell you more about the specs design
and all that good stuff and of course he
will show you the entire build process
as well and all the modifications that
he made so grab yourself a nice beverage
sit back relax because this is gonna be
good
hey what's going on guys Alex here and
it's great to be back with another case
modded system it's a pretty big one this
time in the Coolermaster cosmos 2 25th
anniversary edition case so I'll just
quickly go over what I did to the case
and what was my main goal to achieve
with this case Mon and then I'll let you
guys enjoy d time-lapse video now
obviously the cosmos 2 has been around
for quite a while and I think that
Coolermaster did a very good job with
the 25th anniversary edition however it
could have definitely used a bit more
work in order to bring it up to today's
standards in terms of the hardware and
water-cooling support inside the case I
mean if it's such a large case out of
the box the money supports 810 360
millimetre radiator in the top and
that's pretty much it so this is my
version of what I think the 25th
anniversary edition cosmos 2 should be
now I didn't want to do a lot of changes
to the outside of the cases I wanted to
preserve the look that Coolermaster had
intended for it so the main things I
drew on the outside was to just simply
paint the front and top panel mesh
grilles purple to go at one of color
masters main colors and then I was added
the 25th anniversary logo to the front
so if I guess all of my time on the
inside of the case on what I could do to
improve it such as such a large case I
had enough room to go for a jewel water
cooling loop even though it's not
necessary it's just something I wanted
to do and I think it looks cool so
there's a 360 millimeter radiator in the
top which cools the CPU and I also
managed to fit a 480 millimeter radiator
in the front with some slight
modifications mainly to the mid plate in
order to fit the radiator on the inside
and then also had to slightly shift the
harddrive cages in the bottom so the 480
millimeter radiator cools the Vegas 64
graphics card by itself which column it
is pretty overkill but then again a lot
of things about case modded systems is
pretty overkill anyways other things I
did these also take out all of the other
harddrive cages that were at the front
panel of the case along with the 5 and a
quarter
pays as well and I chose to stick just
with the four high drive cages in the
bottom I also did shave the top off of
the hard drive cages at the bottom here
and this is mainly so you can actually
see the hard drives when they're in
there and then it's also allowed enough
room for my water cooling pass-through
fittings to fit through this bottom
section of the case and you'll see them
go just over the hard drive and also a
little bit over the power supply as well
I've also done a cover for this section
of the case next to the motherboard
where the two alpha cool pump and
reservoir combos are mounted and also
this nice mirrored piece of acrylic that
covers the mid section and then I
drilled all of the water cooling
pass-through holes into that for a super
clean water cooling system overall the
water clean components were provided by
alpha cool and you'll see that I've used
their pre bent chrome-plated brass tubes
which look pretty awesome in this build
the UMaine idea was to have a really
nice and clean system on the inside of
the case something that's obviously been
modded but still kind of look stock as
if the case was designed this way so I
think I managed to achieve this look but
let us know in the comments below what
you guys think now for the rest of the
specs we have the asus rog zenith
extreme motherboard this houses the AMD
risin thread ripper 1950 x cpu with 32
gigs of zelich shield RGB 32 hundred
megahertz ddr4 memory then there's the
vega 64 graphics card which i've already
mentioned I did try to get my hands on a
second card to go with crossfire Vega
64's but obviously with the shortage is
going on at the moment it was a bit hard
to to get my hands on on another card in
time to finish this build so I chose to
go just with the one card and then I've
mounted vertically and I did that using
one of the cooler master GPU vertical
mounting kits which they offer and then
I've also done some slight modifications
to this as well in terms of storage
there's actually quite an insane amount
of storage in this system
aside from the four hard drives at the
bottom there's also a 500 gig samsung
960 Evo M dough to drive on the
motherboard there are also two 480
gigabyte APIs or armored SSDs which I've
managed to the top section will discover
that I've created just behind the
reservoirs here and also with the hard
drives in the bottom there are two fire
CUDA 2 terabyte SS HDS and then also
true Seagate Barracuda 6 terabyte hard
drives as well so with this you get the
sort of faster sshd storage with the
fire cuda and then also very large
expanded storage with the 2 6 terabyte
barracudas and all this is powered by
the cooler master master what maker 12
Jawad power supply intensive the fans
i'm i've used cooler master master fan
pro RGB fans throughout there are seven
of them in total which are 120 Moe on
the two radiators and then also a 140 ml
at the back and all these are the air
pressure version of the fan in terms of
the custom cables and the lighting that
you will see throughout the case this
has all been provided by cable mod
that's pretty much it for me guys I'm
gonna stop talking right here I'll let
you guys enjoyed the time-lapse video I
hope you enjoyed the system as well and
I'll see you in the next one
Cheers
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
