so firstly welcome to harbor unboxed
today's video was meant to be a crazy
over-the-top home theater PC build so
absurd that it's something and expect to
Linus to build I do still plan to make
that video later this week
but there's been something else on my
mind for a while now and I just haven't
had the time required to address it at
least until now over the weekend we were
hit with two extremely hot days in a row
and this meant getting the jobs done
that I had planned to do around the
house this wasn't going to be much fun
on 40 degree days and for the American
viewers that is 40 degrees Celsius so I
stayed inside with the aircon blasting
out cool air I was slightly tempted to
just play video games all day but the
urge to reinvestigate how the three
gigabyte gtx 1060 is getting on almost
18 months since it was first released
was just too tempting I know there's
something wrong with me anyway as I said
this is something I've been wanting to
do for a while now so I jumped at the
opportunity and ran a boatload of
benchmarks before we get to the results
though there is some information I want
to go over and explain the reason why
I'm making this video and also give you
some history on the three gigabyte 1060
and talk about some other comparisons
I've made in the past with it it's a bit
long-winded I'll admit but I think it's
important stuff that needs to be
addressed before we can jump into the
benchmark results let's quickly talk
about the three gigabyte 1060 it was
released back in August of 2016 as a
cut-down version of the original six
year bot model not only did it pack half
as much of a ram but the coil count was
reduced by 10% down to eleven hundred
and fifty to cause the gddr5 memory was
also clocked 11% lower and this reduced
the peak memory bandwidth to 192
gigabytes per second the upshot tool is
being of course a reduced price and this
saw the three gigabyte model come in at
just $200 u.s. while the six gigabyte
model cost two hundred and fifty dollars
u.s. so that's a 20% saving though good
luck finding either of them for that
price in the US right now anyway the 20%
saving from the six gigabyte
was enticing and yet many blasted in
video for creating a three gigabyte
version simply claiming it was garbage
the main criticism being the heavily
reduced to vram capacity and the wiry he
was that before long presumably sometime
in 2017 games would regularly push the
three gigabyte 1062 and beyond its
limits resulting in a stuttering mess
back in late 2016 we found that the
three gigabyte 1060 was a superior
performer when compared to AMD's four
gigabyte Radeon rx 470 then in mid 2017
we compared the three gigabyte 1060
head-to-head in 29 games to the 4
gigabyte rx 570 and here I couldn't
really pick a winner they really were
much the same in terms of performance
however before any of those comparisons
were made we did compare the three
gigabyte and 6 gigabyte 1060 models back
in September of 2016 and found that on
average the 3 gigabyte model is just 7%
slower at 1440p remember it does feature
10 percent fewer cores so this result
isn't entirely unexpected
therefore we concluded that the 3
gigabyte 1060 looks like a great value
option but couldn't really predict how
far into the future it would remain a
solid choice recently we've got a little
bit of insight into this with my system
memory or RAM benchmark if you haven't
seen that video I do recommend checking
it out there's some very interesting
results in that one in particular
pertaining to this video was the three
gigabyte and six gigabyte gtx 1060
testing with various amounts of ram if
you load up a system with 16 gigabytes
of high-speed ddr4 3,200 memory you'll
still really struggle to find situations
where the 3 gigabyte gtx 1060 looks bad
I should note this is how we compared
the 3 gigabyte and 6 gigabyte versions
back in 2016
using a high-end desktop rig with 16
gigabytes of ddr4 memory what I found
more recently and I don't mean this is a
new thing I just discovered it just
happens to be something we looked at
recently anyway what I found was when
using the 3 gigabyte 1060 which often
offloads game data and assistant memory
as it maxes out the vrm with just 8
gigabytes of system memory that's often
filled and that means the data is then
transferred to a local Drive in our case
a solder s
day that last bit is the most crucial
part of all this
generally speaking dual channel ddr3 200
memory is good for a transfer speed of
around 30 to 40 gigabytes per second and
while that's pretty fast it's much
slower than 192 gigabytes per second
that the gddr5 memory onboard provides
but still 30 to 40 gigabytes per second
isn't too bad
meanwhile a good solder SSD can shift
out it between a hundred to 500
megabytes per second so that means
best-case it's something like 60 times
slower than system memory or Ram we've
16 gigabytes of RAM installed that
slowdown is never really seen but with
just 8 gigabytes of memory having a
store all the necessary windows data and
then the base game assets once you start
offloading from the vram things fill up
fast and this was seen in my recent RAM
video in summary we saw in testing with
battlefield 1 that the 6000 buck GTX
1060 saw RAM usage peak at about 8.5
gigabytes
despite only using 3.6 gigabytes of vram
however with the 3 gigabyte gtx 1060 we
saw ram usage hit 10 gigabytes as the 3
gigabyte ram buffer was maxed out this
caused issues with just a gigabytes of
ram as the additional data was offloaded
to the page file which is stored on a
sadder SSD in our case anyway and that's
something that was avoided with 16
gigabytes of ram the solution then was
pretty simple get 16 gigabytes of ddr4
memory mat though isn't really a
cost-effective solution when the entire
purpose of buying a 3 gigabyte gtx 1060
is to save $50 and when you consider
that 8 gigabytes of ddr4 currently cost
$90 it's not really a saving even back
in early 2016 a gigabytes of ddr4 still
cost around $50 however as I noted in
that video all the testing was done
using maximum quality settings and this
isn't what the 3 gigabyte gtx 1060 was
really intended for it's a cut-down
product aimed at budget consumers after
all so I wanted to investigate further
using more realistic test conditions
alongside some less realistic conditions
for this 3 gigabyte vs. 6 gigabyte gtx
1060 comparison we won't be using a core
i7 8700 k clocked at 5 gigahertz with 16
gigabytes of ddr4 3,200 memory rather
this time we're going to be using
core i3 8100 with 8 gigabytes of ddr4
2,400 memory both graphics cards will
feature the same 1.6 gigahertz base
clock with the gddr5 memory clocked at 2
gigahertz to try and make the comparison
all about the memory buffer as much as
we can of course the 60 gigabyte model
does have 11% more cores so we're gonna
have to be wary of that when analyzing
the results all up we have a dozen games
to get through each with 8 individual
results based on an average of 3 runs
for this benchmark I will be displaying
the 0.1% low 1% low and average frame
rates
there's loads of juicy benchmark results
check out so let's get into it
first up we have assassin's creed
origins so let's break down the numbers
starting from the top we have the medium
quality textures enabled now please note
that the very high preset was enabled
for all of these tests I've simply just
lowered the texture option from high to
medium as this reduces VRAM usage there
are other options that will also reduce
VRAM usage but we're going to focus
exclusively on texture quality for this
video so on average the 6 gigabyte model
was 5% faster about what you'd expect
given it has 10% more cause that margin
is extended slightly for the 1% low
result to a 6 percent margin and then 15
percent for the 0.1% low as the vram
capacity difference comes more into play
here interestingly with the high quality
textures enabled the margins do remain
much the same at 1080p moving to 1440p
there's 6 gigabyte model is now up to
23% faster when looking at the frame
time results and this very clearly is
down to the increased vrm then with the
high quality textures enabled we see the
margin grew to 44% therefore as you
might expect the 3 gigabyte model isn't
really cutting it at 1440p that's it
even the 6 gigabyte model couldn't
average 60 FPS using the very high
quality preset so you'll likely want to
reduce the quality settings and this
will help to bring the three bigger byte
version back into play though you could
leave the texture settings higher on the
6 gigabyte model anyway some interesting
results there but let's move on to
battlefield one to see what it has in
store for us here we see the 3 gigabyte
model is hanging in there very well even
at 1440p
looking at the 1080p results first we
see the 6 gigabyte model is up to 10%
faster and again it has 10% more cause
so it's not really a shocking result
then
1440p the margin creeps up to 14% for
the average frame rate though just 12%
for the 0.1% low result finally with the
ultra quality textures enable at 1440p
the six key bart model is now 18 percent
faster although the three gigabyte model
is being slowed down by its limited vrm
capacity the performance was still very
good and we do see a tight group in
between the 0.1% and 1% low results next
up we have Call of Duty World War 2 and
we know this game to be very heavy on
memory usage and we're certainly seeing
evidence of that here although the
average and 1% low results at 1080p use
and the higher quality textures were
very similar on both models the 6
gigabyte 1060 produces a noticeably
better point 1% result oddly though as
we move to the extra quality settings
that large discrepancy for the 0.1% data
seen previously isn't actually seen here
as the 60 byte version was just 13%
faster although the 3 gigabyte 1060 was
able to hang in there at 1080p to
deliver a satisfactory gaming experience
once we hit 1440p it kind of all falls
apart
the average frame rate looks quite good
but we see that the 1% low result falls
away quite considerably
however it's the 0.1% data that reveals
the true problem unplayable stuttering
and that's exactly what we experienced
when testing the three gigabyte gtx 1060
was never intended for high quality
1440p gaming so that result isn't really
that damning for the cut-down graphics
card moving on we have Deus Ex mankind
divided and this is a title we tested
with the ultra quality preset enabled
which is probably a little too extreme
for any variety of the GTX 760 but it
will also help to show any weaknesses of
the three gigabyte model but 1080p
results look pretty good to be honest
and here both models deliver a very
similar experience once we move to 1440p
though things do start to change that
said the high quality textures work well
enough with the three gigabyte gtx 1060
it's not until we enable the ultra
textures that the three gigabyte model
starts to fall well behind that said the
experience wasn't that great on the 60
gigabyte version either and you'll
certainly want to tweak the quality
settings at this resolution for a better
experience
now we have some duet for results and
for this one I've enabled the highest
quality preset in the game and then
tested it with the default ultra
textures as well as the High Court
livvie textures as you can see the three
gigabyte gtx 1060 offered basically the
same experience as a six gigabyte model
so bang for your buck the three gigabyte
version is really superior in this title
we saw no noticeable slowdowns even at
1440p with the game maxed out moving on
a Far Cry primal this title has also
been tested using the ultra quality
preset and we have tested this with the
high abnormal quality texture settings
here the experience again is much the
same using either the three gigabyte or
six gigabyte version of the gtx 1060 on
our budget system using the core i3 8100
with a gigabytes of ddr4 2,400 memory we
again find no real difference between
these two graphics cards this time when
testing with fir on art using the
extreme preset the three gigabyte gtx
1060 performed admirably
even at 1440p as we see a strong average
framerate and frame time performance
praised another new title released in
mid 2017 again the three gigabyte gtx
1060 does very well particularly at
today p even at 1440p with the medium
quality textures enabled performance was
excellent and right we'd expect it to be
in relation to the six gigabyte model
even with the high textures enabled the
results were still decent despite the 6p
white version offering 33% better
0.1% low performance moving on we have
Rainbow six siege and here the tan EP
results once again look great the three
gigabyte model is competing very well
with bigger brother
even at 1440p the results look good with
the higher-quality texture option
enabled it's not until we enable the
very high quality textures that three
gigabyte model starts our drop off and
stuttering becomes a bit of an issue
Star Wars Battlefront 2 is the most
recently released game that I've tested
with and boy does this one look
impressive the visuals are incredible
and the textures look amazing using the
ultra quality preset but with the
textures back down one notch from the
ultra to high setting we saw a very
strong performance on the three gigabyte
gtx 1060 overall smoothness was just as
good as the six gigabyte model and I
wasn't able to spot any differences
between the two when gaming it was
really a similar story even with the
ultra quality textures enabled though
the three gigabyte model did take a bit
of a hit for the 0.1% low result
trailing the six gigabyte model by ACE
19% margin I did use both cards quite
extensively and at times the frame rates
were a little less fluent with a three
gigabyte model but honestly it was very
difficult to spot any differences
however once we pump the resolution up
to 1440p the difference became very
apparent the 16-year bar model wasn't
exactly perfect but it was a mostly
smooth experience the three gigabyte
model oh that was very stuttering and
I'd say overall it didn't really offer
playable performance the second last
game that we're going to look at is
titanfall 2 and here the 3 gigabyte
model did struggle a little bit using
the maximum in-game quality settings we
set the texture quality to high and then
very high starting with the high results
at 1080p the 6 gigabyte model was 7%
faster for the average frame rate 9%
faster for the 1% low and 24% faster for
the 0.1% low result the high texture
option suggests a minimum 4 gigabyte
vram buffer to be on offer and that is a
bit of a problem for the 3d about gtx
1060 although overall performance was
very good and i didn't notice any
stuttering we were right on the edge
here increasing the texture quality with
the very high setting tank 2/3 gigabyte
model and while the 1% low and average
frame rate looked good stuttering was an
issue at times and this is indicated by
the 0.1% low result then at 1440p you
will want the 6 gigabyte model as we
continued to see stuttering with 3d
white version finally we have Ghost
Recon wildlands which was tested using
the higher quality preset and this sets
the textures to high however let's start
by looking at what happens when we
reduced the texture setting to medium
here the 3 gigabyte model was very
similar to the 6 gigabyte version while
it was 7% slower on average the frame
time results were all very much the same
the same thing we're seeing when using
the high quality textures and in fact we
even see a similar story at 1440p so
that's very interesting well we've now
looked at a dozen games using various
texture quality settings at 1080p and
1440p for the most part the results
confirmed what we already knew the 3
gigabyte gtx 1060 is a great value 1080p
graphics card and for those wanting the
game at 1440p well you'll have to
compromise a bit more when it comes to
the quality settings before we get into
that though let's just take a look at
the average data across the 12 games
tested here we see that for the most
part the three gigabyte GT
x10 60 is still getting the job done at
1080p and isn't much slower than the 60
gigabyte version in fact it was just six
to seven percent slower overall and
again given it packs 10 percent fewer
cause this is exactly what you'd expect
to see that margin does however open up
to 26% 1440p when using the second
highest quality texture settings and
then 36 percent slower once using the
highest quality textures the margin is
of course just part of the issue the
real problem is the stuttering and that
can be seen when running out of vram and
this was often noticeable at 1440p okay
so yes I've said the word gigabyte a
good many times in this video and some
clever soul is likely going to point
that fact out in the comment section
below so I'd just like to quickly say
gigabyte gigabyte gigabyte and gigabyte
okay now that's out of the way let's
talk about the gtx 1060 with 3g bees for
1440p testing where it often fell flat
on its face it's really of no
consequence I mean after all who was
buying a cut-down version and expecting
higher quality 1440p performance
hopefully not many still it's
interesting to note that when we last
ran these tests back in late 2016 we
were only able to find a single scenario
at 1440p with a three gigabyte version
fell behind and that was when playing
Mirror's Edge catalyst using the hyper
quality settings those results they were
almost have no consequences the six
gigabyte model really couldn't provide
playable performance under those
conditions however now over a year later
we are seeing some games that are
perfectly playable on the six gigabyte
model at 1440p but not so much on the
three gigabyte version games such as
call of duty world war 2 titanfall 2 and
Star Wars Battlefront 2 for example what
we aren't seeing though is a single game
where the three gigabyte model can't
deliver perfectly smooth performance
using respectable quality settings at
1080p if you look at the VRAM usage or
rather allocation and many of the
recently released titles you'd assume
that there's no way the three gigabyte
model is going to cut it for example I
whipped out the GTX 1080 Ti with its
massive 11 gigabyte memory buffer and
looked into how much via Ram modern
games for allocating a 1080p with the
visual quality settings maxed out here
we see that most games consumed around
the
reader for gigabytes of vram at 1080p
when maxed out and this is why the three
gigabyte 1060 was right on the edge in a
lot of the games tested for the games
allocating four gigabytes of vram you'll
likely get away with a three gigabyte
gtx 1060 but once it starts climbing
well above that with just eight
gigabytes of system memory you're going
to notice massive slowdowns and as a
result frame stuttering so does a three
gigabyte gtx 1060 suck well no not at
all as a budget-friendly 1080p gaming
graphics card it's actually very good
despite what some people will tell you
there's really nothing wrong with a
three gigabyte 1060 anyone buying this
cut-down model are getting just that and
with that should expect that there'll be
some compromises that need to be made as
games get prettier and eat up more via
RAM you have to start lowering memory
intensive quality settings in order to
maintain a smooth playable performance
the three gigabyte gtx 1060 was designed
to compete with the Radeon rx 470 and it
did that very well and it still manages
to go toe-to-toe with the updated rx 570
so hating on the three gigabyte model
simply because it has a limited three
key about vram buffer there's a bit
silly in my opinion unless you're
annoyed that it's still called a gtx
1060 despite having cause disabled in
that case i do agree it is a bit of a
poor choice by Nvidia to do that it
really should have been called something
different maybe even just like the gtx
1060 alle three gigabyte or something
along those lines to make it a bit
clearer to the consumer that this is a
cut-down model wrapping things up it
appears that 18 months later the three
gigabyte gtx 1060 is still going strong
and serving 1080p game as well and
really it should continue to do so for
some time to come
