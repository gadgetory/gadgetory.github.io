before my surgery next week thanks for
all you guys for being so supportive and
for making Steve feel so welcome to the
channel you'll be seeing a lot more of
him in the channel from this point
forward and that's going to help us keep
the content fresh while I'm on my road
to recovery anyway I just want to say
thank you again we only have a small
Channel here but there's already a
strong sense of community and the
support you guys have always given me is
pretty amazing so I'll continue to do my
bit to make sure there's always
interesting tech content on a regular
basis
speaking of which today we have another
big current and previous generation GPU
benchmark this time focused our little
game you might have heard of called
battlefield one yeah apparently it's
pretty good back when the game was in
the open beta stages Steve and myself
put quite a few hours into the game more
than we should probably admit thankfully
we did capture some of the action which
was shown in my triple 4k monitor a
tight next teaser video walking away
from the beta we were shocked not just
by how amazing the game ran but also how
incredibly well optimized it seemed to
be now the retail versions available
we're keen to see if any of the magic
has been lost for testing well over a
dozen GPUs have been used in our core i7
test rig and of course the latest AMD
and NVIDIA drivers were installed
testing the multiplayer aspect of the
games near an impossible with this many
graphics cards you simply can't gather
accurate results so like all the
big-name tech sites I'll be forced to
measure the games performance using the
single-player campaign now this title
does support both the DirectX 11 and
DirectX 12 api's and you might think I'd
naturally focus my efforts on testing
the DirectX 12 this was the plan but
assume became clear that for this title
the low-level API is nothing to offer at
this point the game ran just as well
using DirectX 11 in fact for the most
part it ran better typically the DirectX
11 mode allowed both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs
to render three to five FPS more and at
times the margins were as high as 10 fps
in favor of the older API so I've
included one graph comparing DirectX 11
and DirectX 12 performance of
half-a-dozen GPUs but believe me is the
same situation for all GPUs Maxwell
Pascal and GCN
benchmark passed last 60 seconds we
started the beginning of the through mud
and blood story where you take command
of a British mark-5 tank this test
features plenty of AR control characters
and more importantly and easy to follow
path that allows us to reproduce the
test over and over again with a high
degree of accuracy here's a look at the
rest of that part
ice dry
for everything so smile
as we often do let's kick things off
with the previous generation GPUs
battlefield 1 is a fast-paced
first-person shooter so ideally gamers
will be looking for an average of at
least 60 FPS for optimal gameplay with
the image quality settings maxed out the
r9 380 came close to a 60 FPS average
which is very impressive the gtx 960
wasn't bad either owners will want to
employ some overclocking here the GTX
970 pushed well above 60fps at all times
and the i9 390 was even more impressive
beyond that last season's high-end pixel
pushers had no trouble rendering well
over 60 fps jumping up to 1440p gives
the mid-range GPUs a quick reality check
the Unown 380 and gtx 960 dropped down
into the 30s at times so the game was
still playable but as a member of the PC
master-race it was far from ideal the
GTX 970 is really required here while
the uhnot 390 would be preferred
assuming both are compared at the stock
reference clock speed which they are in
this case now at 4k there are no
surprises here the 980ti in fury X were
never really able to handle the latest
triple-a titles without multi GPU
support the 980ti puts forward a gallant
effort rendering 50 FPS and again while
playable dipping into the 40's kind of
spoils the 4k experience fast-forward to
the present GPU battle and we find the
4th gen GCN cards take you on invidious
mighty Pascal lineup the only
overlapping products here the gtx 1060
and our X 480 both of which delivered
similar performance not just that but
the performance that was delivered allow
for extremely smooth gameplay at 1080p
something you might have noticed is the
performance discrepancy between the two
gig and 4 gig versions for the RX 460
having spent quite a lot of time testing
framerate and frame time performance I
found that for over 90% of the games out
there the difference was negligible
the only anomaly at the time was doomed
recently we discovered when testing
Gears of War 4 for example there was
also very little difference between the
two however here we see that the 2 gig
model is over 20% slower than the 4 gig
model and this resulted in a massive
drop from 45 FPS to just 35 fps
this makes the 4 gig version the
must-have option here and if
plea contradiction to my rx 462 gig vs.
4 gig conclusion or is it at the time I
was chasing 60fps and here with the 4
gig card we're in the averaging 45 fps
this means we'd lower the quality
settings at 1080p without spending much
time tweaking the quality settings we
simply downgraded to the high quality
preset this boosted the 4 gigabyte card
by 16% a much nicer 52 FPS average
however we saw a significantly larger 40
percent performance boost for the 2 gig
model and it's now averaging 49 fps this
means the 2 gig versions - 6 % slower
and more importantly capable of
delivering smooth playable performance
even at 1440p the RX 480 and gtx 1060 is
still provided a nice gaming experience
the RX 470 wasn't bad either with an
average of 56 fps
as you might expect 1440 PS just a bit
too much for the RX 4 60 even if it is
armed with a 4 gigabyte frame buffer the
gtx 1070 is really the slowest GPU you
want to be gaining with using these
quality settings the 4k resolution
obviously if you can afford the 10a it's
a much better option as it never dropped
below 55 FPS and managed to average an
impressive 65 fps it has to be said
while stupidly expensive if the Titan X
does look quite amazing here here's a
busy looking graph that includes the
current and previous generation GPUs
together in a symphony of blue bars as
you can see we have a number of varied
options producing between 80 and 100 FPS
so that's gtx 1060 and our X 480
territory here's the story of 1440p the
gtx 1060 and 970 and delivered similar
performance as did the gtx 1070 and 980
TI the RX 470 looks pretty good sitting
next to the gtx 970 while the RX 460 was
just rubbed out by the gtx 950 not much
more needs to be said for the 4k results
gamers are wanted GT X 1080 here or if
they can survive without food for a few
months the Titan X is the nice option as
well so at this point you might be
thinking what the hell Matt where the
dx12 tests at I don't want to see this
dx11 rubbish well ok you might not be
thinking that but I can assure you
someone's already made the comment as I
explained at the beginning of the video
the battlefield 1
directx12 performance is very
disappointing so let's take a look shall
we
here you can see that for the most part
dx12 is a step in the wrong direction
thus far as framerate performance is
concerned it isn't a huge step but here
we see most AMD and NVIDIA graphics
cards drop a few frames when using DX 12
/ DFS 11 this is pretty much the same
issue we've seen in other titles that
have been designed initially for DX 11
and then basically ported to ds-12 CPU
utilization saturda round 70 to 80% in
both the single-player and multiplayer
portions of the game keep in mind those
utilization result - based on a core i7
6700 K clocked at 4.5 gigahertz so
needless to say the game requires some
serious processing power that said the
game only ran a few frames slower on the
6600 K at the same clock speed my core
i3 6100 system also played very well and
pushed well over 60 FPS at all times
when gaming at 1080p with a GTX 1080
well there you have it
battlefield one is an awesome looking
game that's also very well optimized the
only headache we encounter was the
account limitation which locks you out
for 24 hours after five Hardware changes
that may testing a pain and rather
expensive is three copies of the game
required with that mostly behind us for
now we can look to the positive game is
running modest rigs can really enjoy
this one those rocky a previous
generation Radeon r9 380 GeForce GTX 960
or something of equivalent power and
enjoy battlefield 4 in all of its glory
meanwhile 1440p gamers won't need to
spend their Friday nights looking for
working some Kilda affordable mid-range
options such as they are exploiting GCS
1060 will more than suffice it was
disappointing to find the DX 12 offers
nothing over the aging dx11 api if
anything DX 12 was a step backwards as I
said of course the image quality remains
the same so there's no advantage to
using one over the other and that
respect the issue being of the most part
DX trial was slower or best able to
match the performance dx11 I did notice
on my lower end core i3 test rig that
the minimum frame rates are slightly
higher with the low-level API so for
those running weaker CPUs DX 12 might
provide a small performance bump for
everyone else at this point it doesn't
matter too much which API you run though
I personally will be sticking with
DirectX 11 for this for
extra frames what do you guys think
about battlefield 1 if you picked up a
copy yet let me know in the comments I'm
your host Matt as always and I'll see
you guys next time to those of you that
already support the channel thank you so
much it's truly appreciated and to those
of you that would like to support the
channel directly I do have Amazon links
and a patreon link in the video
description below thanks a lot and I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
