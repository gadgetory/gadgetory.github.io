corner coming at you again on this
wonderful Friday evening or I guess it
will be the morning in some parts of the
world behind now you've all checked out
Steve's big review of the Radeon 7 it's
pretty interesting in my opinion but
ultimately I guess it's a bit of a
disappointing product though we should
have a bit more on this card in a few
days once we get a fresh set of drivers
so yeah stay tuned for a bit more
content on that today though it's all
about the news so let's kick things off
with a look at Radeon 7 availability so
along with the review MDA expiring
yesterday February 7th was also the day
the Radeon 7 was supposed to go on sale
for the general public
previous AMD GPU launches especially at
the high end have been plagued with
extremely low availability and it seems
like this is the case once again while
the Radeon 7 did hit retailers stock was
sold out almost immediately for more
reports Newegg still lists models from
all the major board partners all of
which are the same so there's really no
reason to choose one over another
however every model is now out of stock
as we mentioned in our review we heard
availability would be worse than the
notoriously hard to find our TX 28 ETI
and it seems this has panned out if you
want a Radeon 7 right now there's not
even an option to pay an exorbitant
premium to get one now instead they are
simply out of stock in a statement to
the tech report a.m. be said demand for
the Radeon 7 is strong and they are
working with partners to restock
throughout the next few days they also
said that ongoing supply for the Radeon
7 is expected to arrive on a weekly
basis to meet man so this could be one
of those cases where Andy assesses the
initial market with a very limited early
run before deciding on how many to
produce going forward that said with
most reviews having a lukewarm reaction
to AMD's new flagship gaming GPU I'm not
sure where the demand will continue to
be strong in the next few weeks within
videos ITX 2080 offering better value at
the same price point right now speaking
of Nvidia more information is emerging
writing to the GeForce
GTX 1660 TI which as earlier rumours
suggested is supposed to launch next
week on February 15th it appears as if a
number of overseas retailers have
published board partner models a little
earlier than they were supposed to
revealing a few extra tidbits about the
upcoming GPU the listings are for the
msi gtx 1660 TI gaming x and armor OC
models as well as the pallet gtx 1660 TI
storm x OC and non OSI models video
cards took a snapshot of the very low
resolution pictures of the cards
provided with the listings which look
like standard board partner GPUs I guess
the interesting information comes in
clock speeds we've already heard the
1660 T I will have 1536 CUDA cores but
these listings seem to confirm a bit
more the palette storm X nan-oh C model
in particular has revealed the stock
core frequencies of 1500 megahertz base
and 1770 megahertz boost it also
suggests the card six gigabytes of gddr5
gigabits per second rather than 14
gigabits per second like the RT x 2060
those specs well they're probably not
all that useful right now because we
still don't know how the card performs
and we won't know until reviews go live
but considering this information comes
from several retailer listings it is
likely to be accurate of course with any
early information do take it with a
grain of salt
this next story has been generating a
bit of discussion around the PC
community this week not something I
would normally talk about but well I
guess let's do it anyway Softbank has
sold off its entire stake in video the
company previously held a four point
nine percent stake which were insulting
that of the company called three point
six billion dollars this hasn't been a
sudden decision from Softbank rumours
from December last year suggested the
company was looking at selling their
stake due to envious declining stock
price apparently soft banks still made a
profit overall due to buying and video
stock when it was even lower than it is
right now but as NVIDIA keeps declining
that probably couldn't hold on to it
much longer and basically this is just
continuing in videos horror run over the
last few months
3d mark has added support for DL SS to
their portroyal ray tracing benchmark
this is something I find a little
bizarre to be honest I have nothing
against DL SS in general I think it's a
very interesting idea I don't think the
benefits are quite at the level Nvidia
claims over time it could become quite
useful and of course we're still waiting
on more games to support DSS so we can
investigate it further but I don't think
a benchmark tool should integrate a
technology that's exclusive to one GPU
vendor I think the whole point of a
benchmark tool is that it's not supposed
to be optimized for one company's
products or another answers just
supposed to offer an accurate reflection
of how typical industry standard code
will perform across a variety of
hardware the portroyal benchmark uses
the vendor agnostic DirectX ray tracing
API and that works with both Nvidia and
AMD hardware though within videos
dedicated RT cores it naturally runs all
a better on their GPS right now but deal
SS it's not something that works with
AMD GPUs and presumably won't work in
the future you wouldn't expect a
third-party benchmark tool to add in a
whole bunch of gameworks features that
either work poorly on non nvidia
hardware or just simply don't work and
also I also wouldn't have expected a
feature like do SS to be added hit but I
guess it has and that hence my surprise
that will be here I think it's a bit
problematic because there's no guarantee
that every game that supports ray
tracing will also support deal SS as
ray-tracing gathers wider adoption some
developers may choose to implement the
XR without any specific libraries from
AMD or Nvidia forgoing the LSS or other
techniques so to have this third-party
benchmark that includes an Nvidia
specific optimization that will only
apply in a handful of games doesn't
really sit right with me
but if you are interested I guess you
can now download that update and test
that DL SS for yourself anyway moving on
we have a trio of new monitor launches
over the last week first up we have the
Phillips brilliance for $9.99 H which is
a 49 inch super ultra wide monitor with
a 50 120 by 1440 resolution aka
double-wide 1440p it's on a gaming
focused monitor so it tops out at a 60
Hertz refresh rate but it does use a VA
panel and it comes with a display HDR
400 certification though doesn't include
local dimming
it's also factory calibrated to adultery
of below 2.0 and
pricing is expected to be around eleven
hundred US dollars then we have the LG
32 UL 750 - w this is a 32 inch flat V a
panel and a 4k resolution with the 60
Hertz refresh rate free sync and display
HDR 600 certification there's no word on
local doing but I expect this isn't a
feature although the panel is good for
95 percent DCI p3 coverage and 600 nits
of peak brightness it too is factory
calibrated it can work over USB C and
should be priced around 750 US dollars
and the third monitor is the AOC CQ 32
g1 and that's a new addition to their
cheap one gaming line this is a fairly
standard display 32 inches code VA at
1440p with the 144 Hertz refresh rate
and free sync and I suspect was using a
similar panel to most others that pack
these sorts of specs it comes in at 395
dollars in the US which is a reasonable
prices not necessarily the cheapest but
it's not a bad deal either into the
quicker topics now that crazy gigabyte Z
390 horas extreme water force
motherboard that we looked at a news
corner I think it was a couple of weeks
ago now that has an official price and
it's a crazily high price if you want
this said 390 board which comes with a
massive water block that covers the CPU
socket v RMS and more you'll have to
fork out nine hundred dots yes
nine hundred us and toys at least for
that price you also get a ton of RGB
LEDs EA shares have tanked after a poor
financial report reveal disappointing
sales of battlefield 5 along with
falling revenue in their mobile division
and what will please many gamers the
most hated company in gaming said
battlefield 5 missed their targets by 1
million copies it still sold 7.3 million
overall but that wasn't enough and it
also didn't bring in as many origin
premiere subscribers as they had hoped
lackluster sales are probably related to
lackluster reception at launch with
battlefield 5 with many people
complaining about the game launching in
an unfinished state with too many
missing pieces of content EA stock took
a dive after the report was released
although it has since recovered slightly
unfortunately for those praying for EAS
demise the success of recent release
apex legends along with the impending
release of
and then we'll actually see the
company's fortunes rise over the next
month or so final topic for this week it
has been discovered that there are two
variants of Intel's Core i5 9400 and
core i5 9400 f1 variant which uses the
p0 stepping is based on intel's
eight core die and uses solder thermal
interface material or s Tim as the 9400
is a six core CPU that variant does have
two cores disabled and of course the F
model also CI GPU disables the other
variant with u zero stepping uses Intel
six core die and comes with a regular
thermal paste and with no cause disabled
Intel did confirm to Tom's Hardware that
over time the company will transition to
solar using the p0 vary with solder but
initially some models will come with
thermal paste depending on the location
of manufacturing and that's it for this
