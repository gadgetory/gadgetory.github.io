if you missed it last month I checked
out samsung's new 960 pro 1 terabyte SSD
now this was a very very fast and
through this great SSD that blew the
competition away with ease
the only catch well other than the
enthusiast grade price if you will is
availability still a month later you
can't actually buy the 960 pro and major
online retailers such as Newegg
suggesting that it won't be available
till January or maybe even February of
2017 so that's really disappointing
pricing starts at 330 us or 430 ozzie
and that's for the 512 gigabyte model
and I have to say pricing does climb
quite rapidly from there still the 960
pro series is certainly worth the asking
price but these extreme performance SSDs
really are overkill for most users so it
can be hard to justify spending that
much fully aware of this Samsung is
offering a slightly cheaper alternative
it still offers pretty much the same
features and extreme performance the Evo
series has been updated and now the 960
Evo is able to slay pretty much every
Satur SSD on the market as well as a
good number of PCI Express SSDs as well
like the 960 pro series the new 960 Evo
models take advantage of the nvme
protocol and as such utilize the PCIe
interface all models are built on the m2
2280 form factor and use Samsung's 48
layer v-nand Samsung's latest generation
SLC caching technology branded
intelligent turbo right is also being
used here they've also improved thermal
controls so you can write data longer
without overheating the drives also
boast the larger buffer so you can write
larger chunks of data at full speed all
of these technologies and features come
together very well for the 960 pro
series so we're expecting to find much
the same again so then what's the
difference what makes the 960 Evo series
more affordable the key difference being
the type of NAND flash memory being used
the pro series uses mlc v-nand whereas
the Evo series has been equipped with TL
CV
and the claimed impact on performance is
very minor sequential read speeds in
bend down greater from 3.5 gigabytes per
second to 3.2 year bytes per second
while the write throughput drops from
2.1 gigabytes per second to 1.9
gigabytes per second this kind of
reduction in performance isn't something
most users are going to notice in fact
I'm willing to bet almost no one could
notice the difference the real impact of
using TLC memory opposed to mlc comes
down to reliability when compared to mlc
or multi-level cell which stores two
bits per cell TLC three level cell
stores three bits per cell as the name
suggests this improves density or
capacity but in doing so reduces
performance and most crucially endurance
as such the insurance rating takes a
huge hit here whereas the 960 pro 512
gigabyte model is good for 400 terabytes
of written data the 500 gigabyte Evo
drive is only rated for 200 terabytes
Samsung is offering the 960 Evo series
with a 3-year warranty
which means in order to reach the 200
terabytes of written data within that
period users would have to be writing as
much as 128 gigabytes of data to their
SSD per day that is an insane amount of
data essentially you'd be filling the
entire drive every few days at that rate
in my opinion it would be unrealistic to
even suggest that the typical user would
write that much data in an average week
so really for the majority of users is
irrelevant whether an SSD is rated for
200 or 400 terabytes of written data as
even 200 terabytes of writes is going to
take a significantly long time to
achieve for most obviously more is
better for reliability but unless you're
running an enterprise data warehouse or
something of that nature then you're
probably okay moving on the SSD 960 Evo
comes in three capacities the smallest
of which is the 250 gigabyte model the
250 gigabyte Drive is been priced at 129
dollars u.s. or roughly 170 ozzie the
500 gigabyte model that we have costs
249 us which works out to be about 330
ozzie and the one terabyte model which
will set you back 479 us or 565 aussie
samsung claims that a typical load the
one terabyte drive will consume 5.7
watts 5.41
for the 500 gigabyte model and 5.3 watts
for the 250 gigabyte model those are
similar ratings for the 960 pro series
all three versions of the 960 Evo
measure just 80 millimeters long just as
we saw with the 960 pro series and again
this means they adhere to the m2 2280
form factor the drives way between eight
point three and nine grams with the one
terabyte variant being the heaviest all
three models boast the same 3.2
gigabytes per second read speed though
the write performance does vary the 250
gigabyte model for example has a write
speed of 1.5 gigabytes per second the
500 gigabyte model that we're looking at
is rated to 1.8 gigabytes per second and
the largest 1 terabyte model is said to
be good for 1.9 gigabytes per second
finally the 960 Evo series provides all
the same data encryption features as all
other Samsung SATA SSDs kick-starting
the benchmarks let's take a quick look
at the sequential read and write
performance using the AS SSD benchmark
here we see that the 960 Evo isn't a
great deal slower 960 pro when
sequentially reading and writing data
the Evo reach just over 2 point 6
gigabytes per second for the read test
and 1 point 6 gigabytes per second for
the write test making it incredibly fast
moving to the 4k 64 thread test we find
that yet again the 960 Evo isn't a great
deal slower than a 960 Pro model it is
worth noting here that the Evo write
performance is considerably greater than
that of intel's SSD 750 series the
access time results are surprising as
the 960 Evo was slightly quicker than
the pro series here the results are
certainly within the margin of error but
it suggests that the read and write
access time of the Evo series is
comparable to the pro this also made the
960 Evo much faster than pretty much
every other SSD tested this is the type
of scenario where that massive read and
write bandwidth comes in very handy
extracting a large 38 gigabyte file
archive on the 960 Evo took just under a
minute thanks to a rather snappy
throughput of 660 megabytes per second
this meant that the Evo wasn't a great
deal slower than last year's 950 Pro
though it was through 2 percent slower
than the 960 pro the 960 Evo was also
very snappy in our game and program copy
tests here it only came second to the 9
6
Pro while it was a good bit faster than
Intel's SSD 750 series the Evo drive
sustained 856 megabytes per second for
the game copy test and 512 megabytes per
second for the program copy test now
let's see how all that extra bandwidth
might benefit general use case scenarios
first up we have the classic boot test
this one is pretty simple we measured
the time it took for the system to load
starting the test is the Windows 10 logo
appears we then stopped the clock the
moment the desktop loaded this took
Samsung's 960 Evo just 6 seconds an
impressive time indeed that said the
crucial MX 300 wasn't far behind taking
just 9 seconds meanwhile for those
wondering a mechanical hard drive such
as Western Digital z' read pro 4
terabyte hard drive kept us waiting
quite a bit longer at 36 seconds to
measure game load times we used call of
duty infinite warfare and we measured
the time it took to first load the game
and then continue the single-player
campaign mission we've cut out the
splash screens and any input delay from
us so all you have here is pure load
times essentially if there were no
splash screens this is how long it would
take you to get into the game and start
playing in the case of the 960 Evo that
was just 11 seconds very impressive
stuff again the MX 300 takes a little
over twice that time at 25 seconds still
there's a huge improvement over the WD
red pro hard drive which took a little
over twice as long again at 53 seconds
price at $250 u.s. or 330 ozzie this 500
gigabyte SSD provides exceptional value
given the performance that said for
general users who just want to play
games or rather than general users I
should say gamers who want to play games
or general users who just want to surf
the net do emails and even office type
applications like Word Excel all that
kind of stuff then the 960 Evo really is
overkill for well under half the price
you're going to get the same sort of
experience out of something like crucial
x' MX 300 for that reason the 960 Evo
finds itself in a bit of an awkward
position it's roughly 24 percent cheaper
than the equivalent 960 Pro Drive
and while that's a decent discount it's
probably still not enough
as I said mainstream users will be
served just as well by something like
crucial zem X 300 or any other
affordable sada TLC based SSD and at a
cost of just 20 cents per gigabyte they
are significantly cheaper the
performance you get from these new nvme
SSDs can really only be taken advantage
of by professionals or extreme users if
you will these users aren't going to be
interested in saving a little bit of
money on a slightly slower bottle using
Telsey memory or at least I don't think
they would be basically Samsung is
hoping to entice consumers into
splurging on the 960 series with the
slightly more affordable Evo SSDs which
as we have just seen still promised big
bandwidths if you are able to take
advantage of all that extra bandwidth in
the 960 Evo series really is good value
sadly though for most it will be a case
of spending something like a hundred and
fifty percent more per gigabyte for no
noticeable performance increase over TLC
based solder drives and well that's my
honest opinion what samsung's new 960
evo does do is make intel's SSD 750
series and toshiba 0 CZ Rd 400 a series
completely irrelevant for consumers
seeking maximum performance the choice
is very plainly either the 960 Evo or
the 960 Pro personally though I think I
would dig a little deeper and get the
960 Pro for that extended warranty and
greater endurance rating with that I'm
going to leave it there and let you guys
take to the comments section I'm your
host Steve see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
