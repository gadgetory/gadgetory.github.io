today's video won't be covering Verizon
in fact there won't be any kind of rise
in testing included at all hmm
instead I'm actually circling back to a
CPU everyone couldn't stop talking about
just before the rise and release you got
it
the pentium g 4560 back in january i put
together an extensive benchmark video
that covered the g 45 60s gaming prowess
in detail I totaled that video the
ultimate gaming benchmark guide and
looking back you guys seemed of agreed
that video was followed up with a
modified version which included testing
with the Radeon rx 470 and that video
was even more popular after that I left
the G 45 60 content to cool off and I
moved on to other things that's and I
had always planned to create an
affordable G 45 60 build video a few
weeks later but as more and more content
piled up I never got around to it
coolermaster did however send over a
power supply case and a few other bits
to make a budget G 45 60 build video and
with so many of you still asking for
that content I thought was at that time
I made it happen so here we are G 45 60
in hand and a heap of really nice
affordable PC hardware I picked up the
asrock h1 10m - HDS motherboard as the
name suggests this is H 110 motherboard
providing you have bass version 7.1 or
newer then the board will happily
support cable 8 processors the reason I
picked up this motherboard is because
it's extremely affordable yet will allow
us to extract the maximum performance
from the G 4560 processor that said we
will be limited to ddr4 2400 memory but
that's fine so given that we are going
with an 8 gigabyte kit of g.skill
ripjaws v series ddr4 2400 memory for
storage we have a kingston uv1 40 128
gigabyte as the boot drive and this is
an exceptionally good value SSD for this
build we're going to be targeting lower
end 1080p gaming so a mixture of medium
to higher quality settings will probably
be used for the most part and for that
we have the geforce gtx 1050 the RX 460
is also an acceptable option here but
for the sake of this build I went with
the tiny msi gtx 1050 2 g OC finally
powering
everything is the affordable
Coolermaster master what like 500 power
supply this is an Australian only option
or at least four regions with 200 to 240
voltage inputs from the wall 500 watts
is considerably more power than what
this bill will require but down under
this is a great value unit so you will
easily get away with a decent quality
say 300 watt model capping off the build
is the simple yet stylish looking cooler
master master box light 3 again this is
a very affordable bit of kit the case
weighs just 3.6 kilograms and is very
compact even for a micro ATX case still
inside there is plenty of room you can
fit a 240 millimeter radiator 345
millimeter long graphics card 157
millimeter tall CPU cooler 13.5 inch
drive and of course a 2.5 inch drive as
well all said and done this bill will
come in at well under $500 u.s. or
around 600 Aussie for a completely new
gaming PC this is exceptional value but
how old is it game well let's go find
out
how's it going watch
so there you have it a very capable
budget gaming rig for those of you
seeking loads more benchmark data check
out my previous G 4560 performance
videos I'll be sure to link them in the
video description really demanding games
such as battlefield one played superbly
using the G 45 60 and GTX 1050 combo
with the medium quality preset the game
still looked great at 1080p and in the
multiplayer portion of the game
framerate stayed above 60fps for the
most part the experience was smooth and
enjoyable there was the odd hitch here
and there but I believe that's really
down to the fact that we're using 8
gigabytes of ddr4 memory this game
really requires 16 gigabytes for perfect
performance other new triple-a titles
such as Mass Effect Andromeda are mostly
GPU bound so the emphasis here was
really on the GTX 1050 but again using
the medium quality preset we saw frame
rates hover around 50 FPS for the most
part which is very acceptable
competitive first-person shooters can be
enjoyed using the high quality settings
at TEP and here we regularly saw
framerate at or above 80 fps most
importantly the experience was perfectly
smooth with no framerate stutter at all
so overall a great budget build and
there really is no better option right
now for those wanting to build a cheap
gaming PC using brand new hardware the
cooler master master box-like 3 is a
smart choice in my opinion it looks
great it's very light and compact and
that makes it ideal for loking around 2
LAN parties as for the upcoming Rison
alternatives I'm not sure AMD will be
able to dethrone the G 4560 anytime soon
I will probably have to wait for their
next generation AP use for that the 4
core AMD Rison 3 1100 will no doubt be a
much better choice in terms of
performance but at the expected I think
it's about a hundred and thirty dollars
EOS it's roughly twice the price
speaking of price though there is one
big catch that I should mention and that
is availability or rather lack thereof
right now it seems picking up a g40 560
over in the US is no easy task
major online retailers such as
newegg.com have been out of stock for a
few weeks now while amazon with stock
but at $100 us rather than the suggested
$62 u.s. price so right now for us
shoppers the G 4560 might not actually
be an option and that's very
disappointing thankfully Down Under we
don't seem to have the same availability
issues which is strange I picked up one
of these just the other day for $72 and
the retailer claimed to have dozens of
them in stock
hopefully stock levels and prices will
improve in the u.s. shortly because
right now it looks like Intel's being a
bit dodgy as the rest of the KB Lake
lineup isn't affected before I go to
here I would just like to update you
guys on some of the content you expect
to see on the channel next week what I'm
really excited about is the risin 7 1800
X gaming PC giveaway the Beast is
complete and so is filming this is a
three part series and all episodes will
be add next week on the channel along
with the details on how to enter the
complete PC is worth over two thousand
US or three thousand ozzie and it looks
amazing so I can't wait to show it off
and then hand it over to one lucky
subscriber and I should mention this is
a global giveaway so anyone can win also
in the works for next week is a rise in
memory scaling performance video and
that should be very interesting perhaps
though more interesting that is the fact
that games such as ashes of singularity
and dota 2 have now been optimized for
horizon as a result we are seeing huge
gains in these titles for the horizon
processes and it's an extremely positive
sign of what's to come so that being the
case I'll be sure to include these games
in my upcoming rising 5 coverage anyway
that's about everything for now be sure
to stay tuned as there is a heap of
exciting content to come I'm your host
Steve catch again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
