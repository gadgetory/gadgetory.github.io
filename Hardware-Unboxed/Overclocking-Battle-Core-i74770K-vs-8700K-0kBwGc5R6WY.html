video it's been ever do over if I'm
honest if you missed it roughly two
weeks ago now I decided to bust out my
own house wall core i7 test system
install a GTX 1080 TI on it as you do
and see how it compares to the new
eighth generation Core i7 80s arcade in
today's games player benchmarking did go
into that one but you guys seem to
really enjoy the comparison the only
criticism though being that while I did
overclock the older 4770k I didn't
overclock the new 8700 K since we were
already GPU bandwidth the GTX 1080 and a
few examples that I gave I knew that the
most part overclocking a d7 okay
wouldn't really change much still quite
a few passionate viewers dependent that
I'd go back and retest with the 8700
care of a clock so that's what we've
done I've also added some 1440p results
as well and this is something that many
of you also requested for this test we
have a number of CPU configurations
tested at any peer using sort of medium
mid-range quality settings to ultra
which is maximum the ultra preset as
well as 1440p again using the ultra
maximum quality preset the 4770k numbers
have been updated with better
ddr3 memory it's still 2400 stuff but
the timings are a bit tighter and in
some of the tests this has really helped
I'm now testing with G skills sniper
series 16 gigabyte ddr3 2400 CL 11
memory and I've also increased the
overclock frequency by Turner megahertz
to 4.8 gig arts for all the tests for a
direct comparison I've also clocked the
a7 ok at 4.8 gigahertz my chip does have
no issue at 5 gigahertz but as I said I
really wanted to do a clock for clock
comparison here so I do clock it at 4.8
gigahertz and this is probably a more
realistic overclock anyway it seems like
most people with an 87 ROK are achieving
around 4.8 gigahertz
the big reason for this update has been
to pave the way for my core i7 2600
so that should be interesting for now
though let's check out the updated
results like all good benchmark sessions
we're going to be kicking things off
with
ashes of the benchmark very few gamers
may actually play this game but that
doesn't change the fact that from a
technical standpoint it's a marvel and
it puts most other games to shame it's
also a perfect example for showing the
relationship between the CPU and GPU and
how quality settings impact to that the
high quality preset which can be
considered more of a medium type setting
relaxes the demand on the GPU and
therefore the CPU can stretch its legs a
bit more even so overclocking a d7
arcade doesn't provide that much more in
the way of extra performance so despite
using the higher quality preset we're
still able to find the limits of the GTX
10 atti clocked at 4.8 gigahertz the
4770k was good for a hundred and seven
FPS on average and that meant
overclocked 37 ok was 30% faster and
that's a seriously big margin right
there however jumping to the crazy
preset which applies the maximum in game
visual terrain to a serious GPU
bottleneck for most of the test
configurations the only exceptions here
include the 4 threaded 7600 K and the
lower clocked stock 4770k
comparing the overclocked configurations
the aether market is now just 4% faster
for the average framerate moving a 1440p
though sees the playing field completely
neutralized and now there is no
distinguishing between the overclocked
4770k and the 8700 k and remember we are
still using the gtx 1080 TI for this
test
so in ashes of the singularity the 87
era K was up to 30% faster but under
realistic conditions that see game is
pretty much GPU bound there's likely to
be little to no difference in this title
next up we have Assassin's Creed origins
and here are the 1080p medium quality
preset results not much in it really
after saying quite shockingly
overclocked in the 87 arcade didn't
boost performance and as a result it was
just 10% faster than the 4770k in this
title the margin is reduced it a 7%
using the ultra high quality presets so
not a big margin but the 87 hurricane
was able to add a few extra frames all
the same however now at 1440p the 87 or
okay was just 2 FPS faster on average it
did remain 9% faster for the 1% lower
result but still not a great deal in it
even with a GTX
atti moving on we have the dawn of all
three results and here overclocking
boosted the 87 arcades performance by 7%
at TP using the medium quality preset
this meant here it was 13% fast in the
4770k so again not a huge margin by any
stretch of the imagination
interestingly though increase in the
quality settings we see at the 87 arcade
was able to extend its lead to 17% and
this is as strange as I don't believe
there are any settings here that relate
to the CPU in any way even so the jump
to 1440p saw the overclocked CPUs
deliver virtually the same average frame
rate while the 87 ROK was 8 percent
faster when comparing the minimums
now for some Deus Ex mankind divided
results and here the 87 Roque was 17%
faster in the 4770k with both CPUs
overclocked for this test we're using
the high quality preset at Tony P and
once again the gtx 1080i is handling the
rendering work jumping up to the ultra
quality preset reduced the 17 percent
deficit seen previously - well nothing
at all really 1 FPS so within the margin
of error it's also worth noting that
where is overclocking the 4770k booster
performance by 15 percent previously
doing so now improve performance by just
7% then finally at 1440 people ran to a
severe GPU bottleneck and now all
configurations sped out the same 66 FPS
minimum and 74 FPS average obviously
overclocking either the 4770k or 87 or
okay is of no benefit here with the gtx
ATI
so heavily nailed down moving on we have
some dirt for results and for those of
you rocking a 144 Hertz display the CPU
probably won't matter that much in this
tile even stock the 4770k which was the
slowest cpu tested allowed for more than
160 FPS to be rendered at all times
using the medium quality preset at 1080p
overclocked at average 234 frames per
second and this meant the 87 RK was 21%
faster with an incredible 284 frames per
second however with the ultra quality
preset applied that margins shrunk
dramatically and now the overclocked 87
RK is just 5 percent faster for the
average
frame rate and slightly less we're
looking at the one percent low result
then as you might have expected at 1440p
use in the ultra quality preset we see
the same 124 FPS on average from both
the 87 okay and 4770k again under these
conditions overclocked in the 87 or okay
didn't provide any additional
performance moving up we have another
racing simulator this time f1 2017 our
first that we have the 1080p medium
quality results here the overclocked 87
or okay was 18% faster than the
overclocked 4770k that's a pretty big
margin but of course all the CPUs
allowed to GTX 1080i to render well over
100 FPS at all times jumping up to the
ultra high quality settings reduce the
margin very heavily it has to be said
now the 87 okay was just 5% faster than
the 4770k when comparing the average
frame rate then once again the margin
was completely eliminated at 1440p is
even the 1080i imposes a strong GPU
bottleneck that limits performance
across all CPUs tested the last racing
simulator that I've tested with is
project cars - and here the overclocked
87 ok was 15 percent faster than the
4770k once again we are starting off our
testing with the medium quality settings
at 1080p which sees a far less GPU
limited scenario than the ultra preset
that we're about to look at that said
though we do see a rare situation where
the margin grows when increasing the
quality settings and now the 87 okay is
17% fast in the 4770k overall the
performance trends are much the same but
still it's surprising to say that we're
not running into a GPU bound situation
not yet anyway using the same ultra
quality settings but now the 1440p
resolution the 87 eric 8 is just 7%
faster and even overclocked the 4770k
can't match the stock 7th and 8th
generation Core CPUs I assume memory
bandwidth for the fourth generation Core
i7 processor is the issue here here we
have yet another title where the
overclocked 8700 K is 18% faster when
using the medium quality settings at T P
whereas the 4770k managed 228 FPS on
average in rainbow 6 siege the 87 era K
was good for 269 frames per second
interestingly though this is yet another
title where even at 4.8 Giga it's the
4770k struggles to keep pace with the
stock 7th generation called processors
unlike what we saw with project cars to
their increase in the quality preset
heavily reduces the margin though it has
to be said this has been the case with
pretty much every other game tested
whereas the overclockers america was 18%
faster than the 4770k previously it's
just 9% faster with the increased
quality settings we're also seeing a
situation here where the 87 arcade was
maxing out the 1080i in its stock out of
the box configuration using these
quality settings
finally at 1440p the 87 RK was just 4%
faster on average though it was still 7%
faster when comparing the 1% low result
that said though while the 87 RK was
faster the margin was very slim and with
well over 100 FPS at all times
the overclocked 4770k certainly
delivered a similar experience the final
game I've tested with is Warhammer 2 and
here we find what almost looks like a
frame cap overclocked to the 8700 K and
4770k allowed for the same average frame
rate of around 190 fps when using the
medium quality preset however if we look
at the 1% low result the 87 70 K is 11%
faster that said the 4770k did maintain
at least 143 FPS using the ultra quality
preset while remaining at 1080p reveals
a severe GPU bottleneck and now the
4770k an 87 arcade deliver the exact
same performance
so naturally I expect to see the same
thing at 1440p and that is indeed the
case 77 FPS on average with a 64 FPS
minimum across-the-board alright so what
we've seen so far is pretty similar to
the original video published a few weeks
ago though the addition of the 1440p
testing really gives us a clearer look
at the GPU limited scenarios let's say
before wrapping things up let's have a
look at the results across the 11 games
tested across all 11 games tested the
80s America was on average 18 percent
faster once overclocked when compared to
the 4770k
if you left both CPUs at their stock out
of the box clock speeds the 87 okay
would be 25% faster on average and that
is of course due the fact that
is clocked up to 21% higher still even
with the medium type quality settings
which alleviates the GPU bottleneck for
the most part would you really notice
the difference between 128 fps and 152
fps and again those are the 1% low
figures for each of the CPUs tested when
overclocked so not the average framerate
the 1% low figure of course I am testing
with the geforce gtx 980ti and i feel
that most gamers using such a powerful
graphics card would opt for much higher
visual quality settings therefore with
the ultra quality settings enabled the
87 or okay overclocked was just in 11
percent faster and 18 percent fast with
both CPUs stock so not a huge margin
therefore modest in the 4770k is 1%
lower result of 98 FPS is very
respectable then finally at 1440p the
overclocked 87 era k was just 4% faster
on average though when looking at the 1%
lower result it was 9% faster so
unsurprisingly the 87 or K is the
fastest CPU of the 2 but when it comes
to realistic gaming conditions it's
really not that much faster so as I said
in my previous video I don't think the
upgrade from either the 4770k or 4790k
to the 87 or k is going to be worth it
for the most part gamers won't even
notice the difference also please note
that both the 4770k and 4790k
overclocked 24.0 cue goats will deliver
the exact same performance they are
based on the same architecture after all
although decent gains were seen at times
remember we are using a GeForce GTX 1080
I hear you do after you playing at 1080p
and you can't be upscaling or making
heavy use of anti-aliasing for example
meanwhile if you are spending $700 us on
a graphics card buy a new CPU or
motherboard and memory combo isn't
something you really ought to think
twice about anyway
also as I did say previously you're
almost always GPU limited with a core i7
processor even a 4-year old one the
updated 1440p results proved this and
again I was using a GTX 1080 Ti
those using a standard 1080 will see an
even smaller margin while those were the
10 70 or perhaps even something slower
will see the margin completely
eliminated altogether
all that said though I am glad I took
the time to update the Haswell results
of the 4.8 gigahertz overclock with the
new memory that I got my hands on and
just those extra test conditions and the
1440p testing the next step now though
would be to include an unlocked Sandy
Bridge processor so a second generation
Core processor core i7 processor that is
to see how that stacks up it'll be very
interesting indeed I have about 20% of
the way into that testing with the 2600
ok though I haven't even started do you
have a clocking part and my zd68
motherboard just refuses to boot now
it's working fine one day shut it down
got it the next day to continue on push
the power button nothing I've tried a
few different things power suppliers and
all that and the board refuses to do
anything so dead board I will have to
get a new Xen 68 board or a newsie 77
board and they're quite hard to track
down at a reasonable price but that's my
mission for the rest of the week so
until I can do that the Sandy Bridge
version will be slightly delayed but I
flew the next week or two I can get that
on the channel anyway that's going to do
it for this one if you liked the video
please hit the like button that's very
helpful leave some comments below also
love to hear from you guys and yeah I'll
see you again next time
or soon yeah I'll see you again soon
which will be next time which will be
soon because I'll have another video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
