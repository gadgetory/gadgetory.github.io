look at the G 633 Artemus spectrum from
Logitech their flagship wired gaming
headset and I was very impressed in this
video i'll be putting the wireless twin
under the microscope the G 933 Artemus
spectrum there was a time when gamers
wouldn't even consider Wireless tech and
for good reason thankfully it's come a
long way in the last few years and
several companies have produced
creations that really do cut the mustard
and combine excellent performance with
Wireless convenience as I said the yg 63
is set a pretty high precedent so if the
G 93 s can match that with the bones are
being Wireless then you'll be seeing a
very happy face at the end of this video
aesthetics wise they really are
identical side-by-side there's no
obvious way to tell the difference when
you have the g63 3 wires unplugged I
needed to pull the side cap off to
determine which is which this is no
surprise but it is a positive in my mind
the overall design looks pretty damn
cool and none of this was sacrificed to
enable wireless connectivity you'll find
the same plush ear cups same RGB
lighting strip and the same logitech
gaming G logo the same detailed and
decorated headband and the same matching
ear cut meshed of course there's
removable panels on the outside of the
ear cups the g9 three threes are
comfortable just like the g63 threes
were and they really wrap around the
head quite tightly this is something I
noticed more as I use the g63 3s over
time they really are very comfortable
headset however I found personally when
wearing them over a long period of time
they felt a little too tight and heavy
down a super-heavy headset considering
they are Wireless and I think the
firmness of the grip around my head has
a lot to do with it such a thing will
certainly come down to personal
preference I've seen some other
reviewers and users online complaining
about a problem with their headsets
sliding off the back of their heads I
personally never found this to be an
issue and the only way I could recreate
it was by positioning the headset quite
far back on my head with the headset in
my normal position they sat nicely this
isn't the lightest headset going around
and if they grouped any tighter than I
believe comfort would be a real issue on
the g63 threes I believe the removable
panels were simply there to allow gamers
and sponsored gaming teams to use custom
ear cap identifies the g9 33 is also
afforded this luxury however there's a
much more clever design aspect to these
ear cups - popping both sides off you'll
discover that one side houses and allows
access to the battery the other side
actually contains the us video receiver
how cool it will definitely help prevent
travelling gamers from losing the dongle
for travelling however the Geno 33s may
not be the best headset they don't
really fold up at all beyond some ear
cups swivels
and they do take up a fair bit of space
a carry case fish headphones would be
great as I mentioned in the last video
and it would have been a great inclusion
probably the best part of the g9 33 is
their adaptability and features whilst
they are wireless they do come with the
same connectivity options as the g63
threes and then some there's a USB cable
to connect directly to your PC which
also charges the battery as well as a
standard three-and-a-half millimeter
audio jack with an inline mic and remote
that can be plugged into anything
including current gen console
controllers though unfortunately it will
be in stereo mode not 7.1 surround you
can also plug this directly into your
phone for hands-free chat the final
connectivity options quite unique
there's a three-and-a-half millimeter
audio jack in the back of the USB
receiver and included in the package is
nicely a two three-and-a-half millimeter
cable that you can plug directly into
this with this cable we connect
virtually any input such as your home
theater TV stereo cetera into your
headset wirelessly pretty nifty I think
in order to enable and configure the 7.1
surround sound as with the g63 3s the
Logitech Gaming software must be
installed this software is
straightforward to install and easy to
use and allows you to mess around with
sound profiles and lighting effects as
you please the same three programmable
GE keys found on the head
at 2:00 and this can be competed to any
function in the software also something
else I like on the headset is the volume
wheel found on the back I need the G
keys as I mentioned in the G 633 video I
found this to be very intuitive when I
wanted to quickly change the volume and
over time it's become a real habit no
longer do I look to my keyboard media
buttons to change the volume in Windows
and now when I wear a different headset
I find myself reaching for the volume
wheel that unfortunately isn't there
unsurprisingly the mic found in the G
933 is again the same I've used it to
record this piece of the audio it's a
boom mic that folds up into the headset
subtly when you want them to look like
normal headphones and then folds down
easily with an extendable flexible arm
like most marks found on premium
headsets these days it's a noise
cancelling mic and it sounds about as it
expect the best feature in my opinion is
the little indicator light on the end
that shows you at a glance whether you
have the mic muted the Box burst is 12
hour battery life and this does seem
about right based on my experience using
them apparently the use of all of the
igb lighting could affect battery
performance up to 30% so if someone who
personally doesn't really care for
having my headphones lit up like a
Christmas tree I probably would simply
turn them all off if these are going to
be my daily drivers the fact that the
battery is so easily removable and
replaceable is a big bonus and the
simplicity of the USB charging cable is
great too
finally the sound quality is excellent
and immersive as with the g63 3s there
are very clear mids and highs and the
base is punchy they're really great for
listening to hip-hop and EDM the sound
profile really suits FPS gaming too
the 7.1 surround sound works very well
and you get a real directional stance at
all times when the logitech gaming
software is installed and it is enabled
the headset also has the capacity to be
very loud I didn't find the need to go
about 50% volume aside from when testing
the audio quality for me the highlights
of the G 933 include the excellent and
very reliable wireless performance high
build quality attractive yet functional
design and the wealth of connectivity
options and of course that great sound
there are very few things I disliked
about g9 three 3s though it would have
personally loved a purpose-built carry
case also as mentioned earlier I found
them to hug
I had a little too Thai for prolonged
use though I do have a pretty big head
it's also worth noting that this isn't
the most portable headset and they might
be a little too bulky for some that said
it is hard to fault Logitech here as I
suspect this is the cost of creating
such a well-built feature-rich headset
overall the g930 3s are a fantastic
headset as it expected a flagship from
Logitech they're versatile comfortable
great looking feature packed and the
sound quality is excellent
I believe the g930 threes are easily one
of the best wireless options on the
market today and the price is about
right at 200 US dollars thanks for
