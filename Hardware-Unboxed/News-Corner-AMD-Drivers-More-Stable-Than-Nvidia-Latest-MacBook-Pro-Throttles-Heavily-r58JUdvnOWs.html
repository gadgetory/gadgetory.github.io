hardware box news corner happy to say
I'm feeling much better than last week
so no need for Steve to fill in for me
this time anyway there's a fair few
interesting topics to get to in this one
so let's head straight into it the first
story is pretty damn funny if you ask me
Apple's new MacBook Pros have been found
to throttle significantly under full
load with the weak cooler in their slim
bodies getting completely overwhelmed by
Intel's latest six core coffee-like
processes for laptops Dave 2d first
discovered that their model with the
core I 989 50 HKS CPU inside actually
ran below the rated base clock of 2.9
gigahertz in a premier Pro render in
normal operating conditions when he put
the laptop in a freezer the render
completed in a significantly shorter
amount of time
pointing to serious thermal issues with
the cooler and this issue is further
corroborated by a notebook check who
tested a MacBook Pro with the i7 8850 H
inside and also found it ran
significantly slower than other laptops
with a similar processor inside in fact
notebook checks said that the new model
with the six core processor inside was
only 13 percent faster than the old
model with the quad core i7 7700 HQ
inside at least in the Cinebench r15
test in most other laptops that you use
these new coffee lag chips that margin
is much closer to the 50 percent
improvement in core count this is a
pretty embarrassing situation for Apple
it's quite surprising to me that Apple
wouldn't bother to design a cooler that
can appropriately handle these new CPUs
but I guess we are talking about a
company that also decided to remove all
the useful ports from their
professional-grade laptops not that long
ago
hopefully word gets around about these
performance problems so that prospective
buyers don't jump in thinking they're
getting you know significantly improved
performance only to find out that it's
actually not that much better than the
last gen MacBook Pro AMD has been
touting this week that their graphics
driver is the most stable in the
industry
apparently this comes from a white paper
published by QA consultants who ran a
single test on windows called crash that
loops through a range of basic tests
like changes in resolution sleeping
waking up screen rotations and more
QA consultants ran this test for 12 days
straight on three consumer cards and
three professional cards each from AMD
and NVIDIA when tallying up the numbers
of times the test failed on each system
AMD passed 93% of all 432 attempts while
in-video passed 82% of the attempts now
it's all nice to say that AMD drivers
are more stable but let's be honest here
this research firm only used one
specific tests within the sounds of it
it's not exactly representative of
actual games or pro software just based
on the gaming rooms I've owned and used
it's far more likely you'll get a driver
crash in a game than when doing
something like changing a resolution or
modifying some color settings and the
tests from QA consultants don't really
tell us anything about how stable each
vendors drivers are in games so this
might be a good PR win for AMD but I
don't think the report is really telling
us anything useful about the stability
of AMD and NVIDIA drivers in common
usage scenarios samsung has announced
the first LP ddr5 DRAM chips which will
be coming to the next generation of
smartphones and low-power pcs the basic
things to note here is a 50% improvement
in data rate compared to lpddr4 going
from four point two six gigabit per
second to six point four GB per second
with power consumption expected to come
in upwards of thirty percent lower all
of desktop PC brewers will be a bit more
excited about DDR 5 and we should be
hearing a bit more about that later in
the year LP DDR memory is super
important for low-power devices
including some laptops that prefer to
use it over the full powered DDR
equivalent for better power consumption
these bursts lpddr4 chips from samsung
sound like a decent step board for the
technology and that's always nice to see
I'm not sure how much you can read into
this one but some astute viewers have
spotted an interesting line in a recent
MSI advertisement for their be 450
motherboards MSI claims that there be
450 boards sport and enhance land and
digital power design for eight core and
up CPUs some people are suggesting that
in this video MSI have hinted that
higher core count AMD processes but a m4
socket are coming simply by stating that
there be 450 boards are designed for 8
core and up CPUs there have been a few
rumors over the last year or so
suggesting
then two will come in greater than eight
core variants for the standard a m4
platform which is probably why a lot of
people are taking this as a hint that
higher core can't see peas are coming
often though these marketing videos are
made by people who really don't have any
idea about upcoming products from other
companies like AMD so I wouldn't be
reading too much into this it's possible
AMD will release higher core cam
processes with third gen Rison but I
reckon this ad from her side just uses a
bit of mayo to talk up their new be 450
designs
IOC has launched a new budget 32 inch
gaming monitor that could be attractive
to people that just want a basic feature
set in this size for 250 euros so around
250 bucks if the monitor comes to the US
the AOC q30 279 vwf t hate and yep
that's the name they've gone with will
give you a 30 1.5 inch 1440p IPS display
with a maximum refresh rate of 75 Hertz
and freesync you also get a 1200 to 1
contrast ratio 215 it's of brightness
and 5 millisecond grader gray response
times those specs won't blow you away
but it's a pretty good collection for
just 250 bucks or so though I would like
to know what the refresh rate minimum is
to see whether it supports low framerate
compensation no word on when the monitor
will hit store shelves Corsair have
released a new Hydra series closed-loop
liquid cooler the H 100 I Pro it's a 240
millimeter radiated with two 120 ml ml
fans plus of course there's RGB on the
CPU block the H 100 I Pro joins the
other Pro Series cools the H 115 I Pro
and the H 150 I Pro in offering quieter
operation and a better design than the
older non pro models the age 100 I Pro
is now on sale for 120 us so about 10
dollars cheaper than you can currently
purchase the H 115 I Pro 4 and it's a
similar price to the H 100 IV to that
it's replacing gigabyte has launched
their first Oris power supplies the P
850 W and P 750 W which in what will be
a huge surprise to everyone pack 850
watt and 750 watt capacities
respectively both are 80 plus gold
certified included 135 millimeter fan
and a fully modular
they also come with a 10 year warranty
and should be available soon although
pricing isn't known just yet Intel and
micro
I set to end their partnership on 3d
xpoint memory in 2019 the companies
collaborated on the new technology for
first generation products and are
expected to continue that partnership
for second generation products scheduled
for completion in the first half of 2019
but for the third generation each
company will go their separate ways and
further develop the text to meet the
needs of each company's customers if
you're not familiar with 3d xpoint is
the memory technology branded as
obtained by Intel and quantex by micron
although micron hasn't released their
products yet the memory is manufactured
at the Intel micron Flash technologies
fab in Utah and both Intel and micron
take a 50% share of the memory produced
there while Intel and micron won't be
collaborating on third Gen X point it
will still be manufactured in the IMF t
fab final news topic of the week Ubisoft
has revealed in their latest financials
that PC games have actually outsold Xbox
games for q1 of the company's fiscal
2018 year PC games made up 24% of total
games sales compared to 22% for Xbox one
last year Xbox one had a slight lead of
22 to 21% and of course PlayStation 4
remains - the most popular platform by
far with 1.6 times the sales of PC
historically both consoles have always
been more popular than PC and publishers
have often complained about low sales on
PC compared to other systems but in the
case of Ubisoft PC is now their second
largest platform having grown in the
last year which is great news for the PC
gaming ecosystem that's it for this
