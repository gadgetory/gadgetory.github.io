things a little differently though
ultimately the end result will be much
the same rather than kick things off
with a big benchmark video I'm going to
check out the msi partner cards and what
will be a more standard graphics card
review by this I mean just half a dozen
new triple-a titles will be tested
I'll also be looking at overclocking
temps power consumption and of course
Emma size board design this will give us
a good idea of what the GTX 1050 series
is all about however don't fret we
aren't just getting lazy on you guys
later this week we'll put together an
in-depth head-to-head comparison with
the 1052 gig and RX 462 gig graphics
cards shortly following that the same
head-to-head star comparison will be
made with the 1050 Ti and rx for 64
gigabyte graphics cards so there's
plenty of budget GPU benchmark battles
incoming for now let's see what MSI has
in store for us with their GTX 1050 2gig
OC arm for those wondering you can find
the msi gtx 1050 TI for gigabyte OC
video here and steve takes care of that
one there's no reference or rather found
this edition version of the 1050 so Emma
size design should be truly unique msi
offers their prestigious gaming x
version featuring the twin frozen 6
cooler but here we have what i feel the
most sensible options in these base
model OC versions here the massive twin
frozen caller has been swapped out for a
much more compact design which will make
installing these new budget graphics
cards and even the smallest mini ITX
case as possible providing they have
dual slot cards the card itself measures
just 177 millimeters long though the PCB
is just 150 millimeters long
disappointingly MSI's added an extra 27
millimeters to the length of this card
for no reason overhanging the PCB is a
plastic shroud no fans or heatsink so
this is an aesthetic choice then at MSI
not done this their 1050 would have been
the exact same length as the r9 nano
the entire card weighs just three
hundred and twenty-nine grams and the
cooler accounts for less than 60% of
that weight including the fan plastic
shroud and tiny aluminium heatsink the
cooler totals just 193 grams the heat
sink itself tips the scales at 118 grams
and measures just 95 millimeters long
9
too-tall and eighty millimeters thick
yep it's a baby knowing all this it
would be interesting to see how thermal
performance checks out and how loud the
card gets under full load under the
cooler we find the EDB DGP 107 die
sporting 640 cuda cause along with that
we have four gddr5 memory chips made by
hynek's that operate at a base frequency
of 1750 megahertz
by default the GTX 1050 doesn't require
an external six pm PCIe connector so for
this model MSI has decided not to add
one they've also stuck with the basic
three plus one power phase design though
this should be more than enough to keep
this 75 watt TDP card happy around at
the i/o end we finally DisplayPort 1.4
HDMI 2.0 and dual link DVI output these
outputs should have most users well
covered and all three can be used
simultaneously if need be nvidia has set
the default clock specifications for the
GT x 1050 at 1350 for megahertz at the
base clock and 1555 megahertz for the
boost clock Emma sighs beefed up these
frequencies at add by pushing the base
to 1400 and four megahertz resulting in
a boost frequency 1518 megahertz this is
a four percent overclock so we aren't
expecting huge improvements here for
testing our trusty little core i3 test
system has been used and we feel this is
a more sensible way to test sub $200
graphics cards so I guess the only
question that remains is how does this
entry-level $110 Pascal graphics card
perform I'm glad you asked benchmarking
was often kicked off with battlefield 4
so it's fitting we continue that
tradition with the latest version
battlefield 1 for testing was stuck with
the DirectX 11 API for now there's still
a few strange bugs the DirectX 12 that
heavily impact frame time and minimum
frame rates using the ultra quality
settings at 1080p the MSI GTX 1050 was
good for 49 fps this made it just 2 FPS
faster the 950 and 6 FPS slower than the
960 interestingly it was 14 fps faster
than the rx 460 a 40% performance
advantage and in videos favor here as an
AMD favorite we thought Deus Ex mankind
divider would be interesting to include
using the medium quality settings at
1080p the 1050 average is 33 FPS
meanwhile the RX 460 was good
thirty-six FPS making in videos new
budget GPU around eight percent slower
doom using Vulcan is another AMD special
though we have some very interesting
results here using the ultra quality
preset the 1050 crushes the rx 460 with
ease even at 1080p doing really requires
at least a three gigabyte frame buffer
however in videos Pascal memory
compression technology seems to get them
out of trouble here and allows the 1050
to pull well ahead of the 2gig rx 460
I'd say this is a pretty disappointing
result for AMD here Gears of War 4 is
one of 2016's most impressive game
releases on PC so it was a title we had
to include here the 1050 roughly matches
the old 950 which is nobly impressive
that said this did make it 15% faster
than the RX 460 sadly mafia 3 is one of
the worst triple-a titles to be released
this year boiled down it's just a
horrible console port still the game
does have a large fan base and it was
just recently released so we decided to
include it if you do want to play mafia
3 with these entry level gaming GPUs be
prepared to load up the low-quality
preset even with the lowest quality
settings enabled at 1080p the 1050 was
good for just 41 FPS on average that
said this did make it 24 percent faster
than the rx 460 next up we have Mirror's
Edge catalyst and here the 1050 average
roughly 60 FPS using the medium quality
settings this mentor was 18% faster than
the rx 460 which just touched on 50 FPS
for the average frame rate overwatch
might not be the most demanding game but
it is epically popular in a heap of fun
to play so naturally we included it both
the rx 460 and GT x 1050 had no trouble
delivering highly playable performance
at 1080p using the ultra quality
settings that said the 1050 was 34%
faster
quantum break is a 2016 release that's
had a rough road since hitting steam the
gameplay is pretty well though DirectX
12 support has been lost the GTX 1050
managed to stay above 60fps and our test
using the medium quality settings with
an average of 68 fps it was a whopping
45 percent faster than the arcs 460 when
it came time to overclocked the GTX 1050
we maxed out the power Limor and got to
it the end result was a 100% stable base
frequency one cow
and five hundred seventy-five megahertz
with the boost clock a 1689 megahertz
however went gaming the core clock speed
fluctuated between 1840 in 1860
megahertz the memory is also boosted
from seven gigabits per second to 7.5
gigabits per second this overclock
increased performance in Gears of War 4
by 7% taking the average frame rate from
54 fps to 58 fps the same overclock was
enough to boost performance and Deus Ex
mankind divided by 9%
allowing the msi 1050 to match XFX is
our x4 62 gigabyte card here we see our
core i3 test system consumed just 115
Watts when configure with the GTX 1050
pretty incredible stuff this means the
temperature uses slightly less power
than the 750 Ti or delivering
considerably more performance even with
that tiny heating strapped on the GP 107
die this MSI model never exceeded 66
degrees in our game test that result in
itself is surprising enough what's even
more surprising is the fact that the
card was virtually silent under load
efficiency really is king in the geforce
gtx 1050 is proving this once again as
promised it delivers very playable 1080p
performance in the latest titles using
respectable quality settings having now
seen how the 1050 handles itself we
aren't surprised
AMD made the pricing adjustments that it
did over the weekend that said how does
the 1050 stack up against the RX 460
this revised price point let's take a
look now and find out as you can see
even at $100 the RX 462 gigabyte
struggles against gtx 1050 costing
around 14% more on a cost per frame
basis it's interesting to note that
although much slower than the RX 470 the
1050 matches the value of aim DS mid
range contender and its new 170 dollar
MSRP based on the games we tested the RX
462 gigabyte card would need to retail
for just $85 to roughly match the cost
per frame the new GT x 1050 there was
one instance with the RX 460 was seen to
be faster that instance being Deus Ex
mankind divided doom using Vulcan was
another game where we expected AMD to
come out on top interestingly whereas
the 2 gigabyte vram buffer kills off the
RX 460 it doesn't hamper the gtx 1050 s
performance nearly
much as we expected the 1050 is also
incredibly efficient even so it was hard
to believe that our core i3 test system
was belting out almost 100 FPS Nova
watch while consuming a little over 100
watts for the entire system MSI is
little 1052 GOC card also managed to run
reasonably cool which was surprising
given the tiny heatsink the car was also
surprisingly quiet even under full load
the fact that you can slot this thing
into pretty much any system with a pci u
x 16 slot it's amazing as well overall
the GTX 1050 is an exciting entry-level
GPU and graphics cards like the MSI GTX
1050 to do see a really going to ignite
budget PC gaming AMD's moved to discount
the RX 460 was smart and I'm keen to see
how the two compare when testing over 20
of the most recent games for now the
future of PC gaming looks bright what do
you guys think is the duty x 1050 what
you've been waiting for let me know in
