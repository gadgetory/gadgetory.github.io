their mission is with the 14 nanometer
pelage GPUs the company's on a mission
to reclaim market share and therefore it
makes sense to go after the largest
market segment this means rather than
starting with the big boy is aimed at
doing things a bit differently this time
around with over eighty percent of the
gaming GPU market dominated by 100 to
300 dollah graphics card this is where
the bulk of the market share is won and
lost that being the case aimed his first
strike will be made at a two hundred
dollar price range with the RX 480
Radian RX for ad will cost 200 US
dollars for the 4 gigabyte model and 240
US dollars for the a cubic model that I
tested here like all Polaris GPUs the RX
480 is based on the fourth-generation
gcn architecture which AMD claims bros
up to fifteen percent more performance /
compute unit than GPUs used in the
second-generation gcn architecture AMD
says that 4th gen gcn delivers improved
geometry processing and updated memory
controller better memory compression
enhanced buffers trueaudio next
real-time and prioritization compute
among other things for polaris AMD
selected samsung and GlobalFoundries 14
nanometer FinFET based process which is
the dancers family process available
FinFET transistors are crucial to
reducing power consumption and enable
operating voltages that are 150
millivolts lower than the previous
generation thereby cutting active power
by thirty percent from a 1 volt baseline
in contrast in video is using TSMC's 16
nanometer FinFET based process so it'll
be interesting to see how they compare
in terms of size and efficiency
typically in videos had the upper hand
in terms of efficiency if it's some time
now with Pascal proving to be their most
efficient architecture yet we're banking
on big things from AMD AMD has announced
two GPUs to be based on the florist and
I the biggest of which is a 2304 stream
processor enabled Radian RX for 80 which
does use the full silicon the die
measures just two hundred and thirty two
millimeters squared and crams in 5.7
billion transistors this makes the dye
incredibly small for a GPU claiming 5.8
teraflops of compute power in terms of
physical size this means the RX 480 GPU
is similar to the r7 370
a GPU is just 1024 SPU's for just two
teraflops of compute power in total
there are 36 compute units resulting in
2304 stream processors along with 144
texture mapping units and 32 render
output units or raster operation
pipelines depending on your name your
preference these course specifications
place the RX 48 is squarely between the
radeon r9 380 x 99 390 when compared to
the i-93 90 though the RX 480 does have
one major disadvantage memory bandwidth
with the 4 gigabyte and a gigabyte
models feature gddr5 memory clock to two
thousand megahertz using a 256-bit wire
memory bus resulting in a three point of
256 gigabytes per second in comparison
the r9 390 utilizes a 512-bit memory bus
and although it uses lower clocks memory
it still achieves a 384 gigabyte per
second throughput propping up the RX 480
is the core clock speed which has been
set at 1120 megahertz and your boost as
high as 1266 megahertz that's a
27-percent boost over the i-93 90s
operating frequency and should help
account for having ten percent fewer
cause truth be told 1266 megahertz isn't
a particularly high operating frequency
for 40 nanometer part giving a video of
pushing more complex GPUs to around 2000
megahertz using their GPU boost three
point O technology therefore I'd be
expecting the squeeze quite a bit more
out of the RX 418 sadly it wasn't to be
as you'll see in my overclocking video
it is possible my reference card was
just a dud I won't know for sure until
others post their results which will
have happened by the time you view this
video speaking of the reference card
let's take a look at what AMD is put
together here in terms of design we
don't have anything radically new the RX
480 essentially borrows its design from
the previous generations r9 380 the
design is simple and understated yet
attractive there aren't any fancy LED
lights no back plate and the fan shroud
is plastic still it's worth keeping in
mind the prices started just two hundred
dollars so be unrealistic to expect the
kind of features found on the four
hundred dollar plus graphics cards as
always the reference card makes use of a
blower style fan the can draw in air
from both sides of the card which can be
useful in tight spaces the kind of tight
spaces you'll likely encounter when
running two cards together for crossfire
all up the RX 480 measures 240
millimeters low
though the PCB is just 177 millimeters
so it'll be very easy for board partners
to produce smaller ITX type cards right
out of the gate MDS reference card is
also surprisingly light and this is down
to the fact that AMD has gotten away
with using a very small heat sink the
heatsink is so small in fact that we
would have previously only expected to
see this on the lowest end gaming
graphics cards so it'll be interesting
to see how hot the RX for 80 runs of
course we know power consumption is
going to be relatively low given not
only the TDP rating but also that single
six pin power connector even the
previous generations are no 380 featured
26 pin connectors and you had to step
down to the r7 370 before you found just
a single pcie power connector in fact
the PCB design and configuration looks
more like a geforce gtx 960 on board we
find a six plus one phase power design
and eight gddr5 memory chips for a total
vom capacity of AQ bytes interestingly
AMD is rated the RX for 80 to 150 watts
for the TDP which is the same figure in
video gave two gtx 1070 this rating
seems quite high given the
specifications and the fact that this is
a 14 nanometer part now they have a
better understanding of the radiant RX
480 specs and design be sure to check
