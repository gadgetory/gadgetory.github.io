have a quick benchmark video for you and
due to popular request we're looking
into thread ripper 2990 WX performance
using linux so first time ever
testing linux for us apparently that was
something we should have done on day one
according to many AMD fans despite the
fact that we've never done it I'm
ranting anyway rather than just testing
up AMD's new 32 core processor I'll be
testing it against the core I 979 ATX II
as well for reference so we have the
thread Ripper 2990 WX versus Cora 9 79
80 XE using both Windows 10 and Linux in
this case the aboon - eighteen point
four point one LTS both operating
systems were tested in their error box
configuration so no optimizations were
made both test systems have been
configured with 64 gigabytes of ddr4
memory the 2990 WX is limited to 3000
while these 79 80 XE will happily accept
3200 or you could go higher than that
but for the sake of trying to keep these
things sort of apples to apples we've
settled with a low latency CL 14 ddr4
3200 memory okay
let's get to the results M Queens as
part of the fir onyx test suite and it's
one of the few benchmarks in that suite
that I could get to work on both Linux
and windows as well as AMD and Intel
hardware I have to admit the test suite
was a bit of a nightmare to work with
there's basically zero documentation on
what the benchmarks do or how they work
and I was just as I said difficult to
get a lot of them to work anyway this
particular benchmark measures the time
to solve the end Queen problem and M
Queen just uses a larger board making it
a longer more complex problem here we're
measuring the time to solve and as you
can see the 2990 WX does this and around
half the time of the 79ad XE using
either Windows or Linux which is
extremely impressive stockfish is a free
open-source chess engine available on
various platforms and it's consistently
ranked as one of the best chess engines
and is the strongest open-source chess
engine in the world
the speed of this test
is measured in nodes essentially
positions per second and this is
determined entirely by the processes
performance again we see when it comes
to chess the 2990 WX is a beast using
either Windows or Linux that said this
time we do see a 23 percent performance
uplift for the 32 core processor when
using Linux meanwhile under the same
test conditions the 79a exe only saw a
4% performance increase the last chess
benchmark we're going to look at is
crafty and again we're measuring
performance in nodes per second
interestingly the core I 979 ad XE wins
out here and so the biggest performance
uplift we're moving to Linux a 5%
performance increase was seen opposed
just a 3% increase for the 2990 WX and
this made the Intel CPU 12% faster
overall John the Ripper is a password
cracker that's currently available on
multiple platforms including Linux and
Windows using the traditional data
encryption standard we see the 2990 WX
and 79-80 XZ execute roughly the same
amount of crypts per second when using
Windows however when using Linux it's a
completely different ballgame here the
79 80 XE was a whopping 80 percent
faster but it's the 29th 90 WX that's
truly impressive delivering three times
more performance making it roughly 80
percent faster than the core I 9 we also
find a similar story when using the
Blowfish cipher here the 79 80 XE is 7%
faster on Windows but the 2990 WX is
almost 70 percent faster when using
Linux so while the 32 core processor
looks less than impressive using Windows
10 it looks incredible using Linux
graphics magic is a simple but highly
efficient software package for viewing
and manipulating images it supports a
massive range of formats an image
processing is heavily multi-threaded
it's used by several websites to process
large numbers of uploaded images and
here we're looking at these sharpened
performance which is measured in
iterations per minute so higher is
better using Windows 10 the 79-80 XE is
26% fast in the 2990 WX
however using Linux turns that around
and now the 32 core processor is 10%
faster not a massive win but the AMD
processor does come from well behind on
Windows to beat the core I 9 on Linux
the enhanced operation performs around
30% better
Linux but we do see similar games for
both the AMD and Intel processors and
the end result is a minor win for AMD
next up we have the Apache benchmark
which measures the performance of HTTP
web servers and as you can see the
performance is extremely poor on Windows
10 I should note that the server edition
of Windows does fare a little better but
still gets smashed about by Linux which
is why most web servers run Linux anyway
on Windows 10 the 78 exe was 4% faster
than the 2990 w.x but on linux the 18
called process was almost 40% faster so
not a great result here for the 32 core
processor we've seen previously that
encoding performance isn't a particular
strength of the 2990 w.x and we see that
again here as the 79ad XE was 6% faster
and using windows and having said that
it really wasn't much better with Linux
either the 70 or 80 XE was still able to
edge out a 32 core processor so for
encoding workloads Linux appears to do
little to help out the 2990 WX the 2990
WX also sucked in our veracrypt
benchmark and we find these same odd
results with linux for the 50 megabyte
test the 2990 WX was slightly slower
than the 79ad XE when using Windows 10
that said we see when compared to the
performance results on Windows 10 links
actually tanks performance particularly
for the 79 80 XE but where the 2990 WX
really struggled on windows was for the
memory intensive one gigabyte test here
offered half the performance of the 79
80 XE this result was improved on Linux
but even so the 79 80 XE was still 35%
faster so the one gigabyte results are
roughly what we're expecting a fine but
I'm not quite sure what's going on with
the 50 megabyte results for Linux though
I also found some odd results using
7-zip on Linux as well for example the
2990 WX is exceptional decompression
performance seen on Windows was reduced
by 13% when using Linux the 79ad XE also
syrup haunts drop-off though it was very
minor compression performance for the
2990 WX was drastically improved here we
see a massive 54% performance uplift
that said the 7080 XE also enjoyed a
performance boost that was a much
smaller 10% inquiry
still this meant overall the 78 exe was
still 11% fast in the 2990 WX last up
we're going to have a look at the
blender open data benchmark suite and
I'm expecting pretty positive results
here for the 2990 WX given what we've
already seen in Windows here we have the
barbershop interior test and we're
measuring completion time in seconds the
79-80 XC was 23% faster using linux
while the 2990 WX plus 31 percent faster
this meant while the 2990 WX was 21%
faster the 79ad XE on Windows it's now
29% faster using Linux we see a slightly
different scenario with the BMW 27 test
though the outcome still sees the 2990
WX well ahead still where is the 32 core
processor was 52% fast using Windows 10
that margin was reduced to 45% with
Linux this time we see similar scaling
using either CPU both were 48 percent
faster using Linux for the classroom
workload this time a Linux slightly
favored the 2990 WX making at 59 percent
faster whereas it was 52% faster on
Windows we see a very similar story here
Linux lightly improves the 2990 wxs
position but overall both CPUC good
gains on Linux then we have the
pavillion Barcelona workload and we see
more of the same so time to wrap things
up so is Windows 10 gimping the thread
Ripper 29 and 90 WX s performance
unquestionably yes but it is also
gimping the 79ad XE to a certain degree
as well and this is really important to
note because if you were to compare just
the 2990 WX it's performance of Windows
to Linux the situation would appear much
more extreme than it really is for
example you would conclude that the 32
core processor is going to wreck the 79
80 XE and by an even more extreme margin
when carrying out any kind of rendering
tasks but really both CPUs see an almost
identical performance uplift meanwhile
programs that were problematic on
Windows such as 7-zip and veracrypt for
example well they still provided mixed
results when using Linux for example a
2990 WX is compression performance was
strengthened but
decompression performance was weakened
still overall linux did provide a better
balance though having said that we could
still at times see the impact the multi
die design has and the limited balance
let's say and that was seen in seven zip
compression again although I am
reporting the average result of that
test the test does start very high and
then keeps coming down as it runs more
and more iterations of the test whereas
the 79-80 XC produces pretty much the
same score on every single run so we are
still seeing that sort of inconsistent
performance that jumps all over the
place till things are worked out but
anyway in the end the average
performance does end up being a lot
better on Linux even on Linux the
encoding performance was still a bit
lackluster it has to be said though I
have only managed to do very limited
testing so far as spend on memory
sensitive workloads like the blender
renders the 2990 WX woes are based and
this also includes the chess and
password cracking benchmarks for example
so again depending on what you plan on
use in the 2990 wx4 will determine just
how useful it really is still there's
clearly some serious Windows 10
optimizations that will need to come in
order to better utilize or a better
manage these core heavy CPUs I should
just note though that improved thread
scheduling isn't going to make the 2990
WX a weapon and workloads where it is
clearly struggling but it is our hope
that it can at least match the 2950 x
under those conditions rather than come
in much slower results like what we're
seeing in the graphic magic sharpened
tests were promising as the 2990 WX went
from being a much slower than the 79 80
XE on Windows to slightly faster with
Linux and we saw the same thing with
John the Ripper still I realize this is
only a small sample of applications and
doesn't really do much for content
creators like myself I'd love to test
out Adobe Premiere on Linux to see if my
custom warp stabiliser test running a
dozen instances simultaneously provides
better results our Windows this test
does manage to max out the 2990 WX but
the resulting performance is very poor
wrapping this one up I have to say the
few days that I spent mastering our
Linux was interesting but ultimately
made me much more appreciative of
Windows 10 as a desktop OS it's just
world's better at least
in my opinion and well I suppose that's
hardly surprising if that wasn't the
case a lot more a PC enthusiast would be
using Linux so for now all we can do is
keep our fingers crossed for a Windows
Update that improves performance for
these core heavy CPUs and that is going
to do it for this one if you enjoy the
