making it possible for Tim and myself to
attend Computex 2019 please check out
their latest AMD x5 70 motherboards made
for gamers and creators by the link in
the video description also thank you to
Corsair for their support please check
all their exciting products out via the
link in the video description welcome
back to hard rom box steve has already
gone through all the excellent X 570
motherboards and other cool things at
the msi booth but there is more to check
out at this year's Computex show from
msi including a whole new range of
monitors many more monitors and I was
expecting actually as well as a couple
of interesting laptops so let's start
with the monitors I think because you
know I love my monitors here so the
first product that really excited me was
the new mpg three-for-one cqr and yeah I
really do need the notes if these
proclaims because yeah msi likes their
letters and numbers salad going on there
so this is a 34 40 by 1440 144 hertz
curved VA panel so it's quite similar to
the LG 34 GK 950 F in terms of it being
one of the highest refresh rates
available for that resolution and size
it does have a couple of unique features
it has a camera that detects faces and
can change settings based on who sits in
front of the screen so if you have
multiple users could be useful you know
to people different people have
different settings configured for them
they just sit in front of the screen and
it will automatically switch the setting
profiles there it can also be disabled
if you're concerned about privacy it
also comes with two unique things in the
box don't often see this one is a webcam
or camera mount that supports up to 700
grams of weight so that's not just your
sort of cheap webcams but you could
definitely put some sort of decent
camera up there for your sort of
streaming and also it does come with a
mouse bungee both those things included
in the box as I said and msi rep tells
me this monitor will be factory
calibrated so that's nice to see it also
has display HDR 400 certification by the
sounds of it it's typical HDR 400 so
that means basic HDR support at best not
really your true HDR it doesn't really
matter though because it looks like it's
priced very competitively
for a non HDR monitor it's priced at
just nine hundred US dollars that's
locked in did see some reports of an
eight hundred dollar price with MSI
tells me the official price is nine
hundred dollars u.s. that is so good
pretty good competitive price there LG's
competing option fluctuates between 800
to more often up around the twelve
hundred dollar mark so yeah it's not a
bad price of MSI with that sort of
first-generation product there they
always have a monitor that I haven't
seen a lot of buzz on this is the ma g3
21 cu RV yeah it's surprising not to see
too much talk about this one because
it's I guess it is nothing crazy it's a
4k 60 Hertz curved rear panel 32 inches
but the big news is the price I was told
it's going to come in just 500
Australian dollars which would make it
the cheapest 32 inch 4k monitor on the
market here and if you convert the
distort of view US dollar pricing
unfortunately I didn't get an actual
confirmation on what it would cost in
the US but it should be around that 300
to 350 US dollar mark when you do a sort
of conversion there which would again
make it a really great value option so
you're hoping to see that soon we've
also got the MA g27
1r or ma g27 1r either way I guess this
is a pretty cool display 27 inch 1080p
165 Hertz but it is a flat VA so often
we see at this price in a sort of budget
category we see curved vias but this is
one of those flat options that people
like to see should also be affordable
but again no firm word on pricing here
unfortunately then for the creators out
there we have the prestige ps3 41 w/u
this is pretty similar to the LG 34 wk
95 user I reviewed in that it's a 50 120
by 2160 ultra wide 34 inches in size
it's just 60 Hertz but it's still pretty
good for creators it uses nano IPS
technology so I believe it's the very
same LG panel 98% DCI p3 coverage 90
plus percent Adobe RGB as well it's
factory calibrated to Delta YZ below 2.0
on average according to an msi rep
display HDR 600 with basic local dimming
so it sounds like it'll be semi HDR
again similar to the LG model very
impressive feature set for
one of the first creative monitors from
MSI there's plenty of color modes
including all the basic stuff that you'd
want to see it also has a great utility
great software utility it's designed
much better than usual three user
calibration profiles with hardware
integration so that means if you've got
your calibration device you can create a
profile upload it into the monitor and
having three slots there it tends to be
a bit better than I've usually seen for
monitors and you should even be able to
set triggers to change the color profile
depending on the app you're using so for
example you're using Photoshop you could
automatically change it to DCI p3 and
then go back to Chrome and change it to
srgb on the fly have again seem some
seen some places report the price as
thirteen hundred US dollars but I heard
twelve hundred dollars from the reps on
the show floor with that price being
locked in so two hundred to three
hundred dollars cheaper than the LG
option again should be a very high
quality display there at a great price
other monitors there's just a couple of
other updates here the oculus g-sync
monitors with the 1080p resolution and
240 Hertz refresh rate the one with is
0.5 millisecond response time was shown
at Computex last year but never really
came out but that has been released now
so I guess a year later we're starting
to see that same with these super ultra
wide that was shown at Computex last
year and it should be available pretty
soon most of the monitors that i've
talked about today will be released at
the end of July or early August so very
very soon for getting some of these
products in I'm really hoping to get to
review some of them in the coming weeks
I think there might have been one like
the ma g27 one are that wasn't coming on
that day but most of those at the end of
July
moving into laptops the big product at
the show and I mean that literally is
the GT 76 Titan so this is the sort of
thing I think Intel were meaning when
they talked about muscle books in the
latest presentation for Knights Chen
processes however it doesn't use a ninth
gen h-series CPU in fact it uses a full
socketable core I nine ninety nine
hundred K at least in the top-end models
plus RT X twenty eighty graphics it is
unfortunate that the RT X 2080 is a
mobile version rather than the fully
fledged desktop version but should still
clock pretty well when you see the
cooler that they are using and
I was very keen to show off the cooler
11 heat pipes with for fans to thermal
modules one for the CPU one for the GPU
CNC polished plates for the CPU and
plenty of heat sink area to call the
components the thing the entire laptop
actually was pretty loud on the show
floor the show floor itself is loud but
you could definitely hear the laptop
over the the people talking there and as
you'd expect it that's pretty typical
for a laptop of this size and
performance no one on the fan profile
used though it's also unclear how the
9900 K performs here we weren't really
allowed to do benchmarks on the show
floor it would surprise me if the
cooling solution was good enough to put
it up through the sort of desktop level
that you'd see from a high-end desktop
system but I would also expect well
above laptop level with performance from
an h2 CPU know if you're putting a 900 K
in a laptop if you don't want to perform
better than those H series processors
it also requires 2 power connectors with
an adapter so that's something to keep
in mind four point five kilograms heavy
so big boy starts at 3,600 u.s. dollars
goes up to 48 hundred US dollars 1080p
or 4k monitor options and yeah it's a
massive basically laptop the other main
gaming laptop MSI had on show is the GE
65 Raider which is the 15 inch version
of the GE 75 Raider that I looked at
just a little before Computex actually
really liked it has of course the latest
r-tx graphics and up to a core I 9
processor from Intel 's ninth generation
but the key feature I think he is the
240 Hertz IPS level 1080p display so 240
hertz displays are new to gaming laptops
and it's great to see it as well in the
15 inch form factor here with the GE 65
you also get one of what I think is
MSI's best mid-sized sort of I guess
you'd have to say gaming laptop designs
really like the keyboard as well in this
laptop and it comes with the latest
killer Wi-Fi 6 networking experience
thanks to Jerry's tech for some of the
footage that were showing off here as
for other laptops at the show it was
mostly creative focused using the new in
video studio line you might have seen
the announcement 14 video studio I
covered that in my video on the Nvidia
Computex keynote so we did have a couple
of cool products there the things that
really stood out to me were the MSI WS
65 and the W
seventy-five very similar to the GS
series for gaming in terms of it's
designed but you'll get things like a
Quadro RTX 5000 GPU with 16 gigabytes of
vram which will be great for those cred
uplands especially you know large
premier files the 3d modeling or that
sort of thing up to 64 gigabytes of ram
is included in their 4k displays again
should be great for creators I also
really like the fingerprint reader in
the trackpad and the GS and ws design in
general I think is really excellent I
love it on the gaming products and I
think it worked really well for these
workstation class slimming lights as
well we've also got prestige laptops for
creators with some spec bumps to the
latest hardware so all the stuff that
you'd expect there the prestige line
unlike the WS line is more designed not
necessarily for your high intensity
creators for things like 3d modeling but
more your image editing with Photoshop
doing some you know premiere work and
all that sort of theme so very exciting
lineup from MSI really excited to get
those monitors in in particular so I
think they've got really high quality
and budget oriented monitors going for
the sort of value plus high-end specs
across all over their product so yeah
MSI they tell me they are the fastest
growing monitor company in the world at
the moment and I certainly believe that
because in the space of a couple of
years they've come out with all sorts of
mowers across so many different price
categories product categories it is
definitely very impressive to see how
they've grown and I tend to like what
they are able to achieve so looking
forward to reviewing some of those in
the end of July early August sort of
time period anyway that's it for our MSI
coverage at Computex 2019 don't forget
to check out stickers video on the
motherboards some cases some cool other
things that MSI had on show they're big
thanks to them for sponsoring us and as
well as Corsair for Computex 20-19
coverage and I guess we'll catch you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
