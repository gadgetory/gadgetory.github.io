this point we've all seen the
announcement of a new videos new GeForce
20 series graphics cards from the
desktop in the art x20 atti the ITX 2080
and our TX 2070
it won't be too long before we'll get
performance numbers for these cards as
well which is pretty exciting but before
these cards hit the desktop I thought it
would be an interesting thought
experiment a prediction I don't know
something along those lines to discuss
what the mobile lineup of these GPUs
might look like it's a certainty that in
video we'll bring at least some of these
GPUs to gaming laptops after the desktop
launch and a few tidbits we've heard
from industry sources suggest it'll be
around November when we hear about
geforce 20g ps4 laptop so that's about a
month after the release of the RT X 2070
and that makes sense considering with
the 10 series laptop parts were
announced around 2 months after the
launch of the 1070 anyway in this video
I'll be breaking down the specs of the
RT X cards that have been announced so
far and giving my thoughts into how
these GPUs might translate into laptop
versions you know what sort of specs we
can see and what features will be kept
or omitted again we don't have any
concrete information on these parts so
this isn't a rumor or leaked video it's
just a bit of fun speculation I guess
and discussion into how invidious laptop
GPUs typically differ from their desktop
counterparts so let's start with the RT
X xx atti at the top end because this
one is pretty simple it's very unlikely
we'll see the RT X xx attr in laptops
simply because it's 250 watt TDP is too
high for most laptop form factors when
creating a laptop GPU the power draw and
TDP is the most important aspects
laptops have much more limited cooling
systems compared to what is possible in
desktops and this is especially true
when you consider that most gaming
laptops these days are either slim and
portable systems or more mid tier
devices rather than massively chunky
beasts and the slimmer you go the less
cooling power you have which restricts
the sort of GPU TDP SiC and support with
10 series laptops even the most chunky
beasts topped out at fully-fledged
GT
ten 80s as that was the highest-end
laptop GPU Nvidia provided the GTX 1080
on the desktop had a TDP of a hundred
and eighty watts and that pushed down to
around 150 watts for laptops whereas the
GTX 10 ATT I had a 250 watt TDP and
there was no laptop equivalent so with
the RT X 20 ATT I also packing a 250
watt TDP we're almost certainly not
going to see it in laptops as the TPP is
simply too high the ITX 2080 is an
interesting one like with the GTX 1080
in previous generations
I expect the RT X 2080 to be the top end
GPU available in a mobile form factor
and aside from max-q versions which I'll
talk a little bit about later the fully
fledged RT X 20 80 will be restricted to
a larger laptop designs due to its
higher TDP the ITX 2080s TDP is a bit of
an unusual case NVIDIA has listed it as
215 watts for the desktop so that's up
from 180 watts to the GTX 1080 but there
has been some talk that part of this TDP
is allocated for virtual link the new
USBC connector spec designed for VR
headsets supporting this connector adds
around 30 watts to the graphics cards
TDP requirement at least allegedly as
virtual link provides power directly to
the VR headset I'm not sure where the
Nvidia will leave virtual link enabled
for laptop GPUs but I'd imagine using a
VR headset with the laptop is a bit more
of a niche use case than VR with a
desktop in any case I'd assume laptop
vendors could choose not to support
virtual link and therefore not have to
worry about the added TDP cost of the
connector so in that case laptops with
that virtual link could integrate an RT
X 28 e and theoretically I only have to
design a cooler for a TDP of 185 watts
or so that's pretty similar to the GTX
1080s TDP of 180 watts and then with
further laptop optimizations we'll
likely see that drop back down to around
the 150 watt mark of the 10 eighties
laptop bearing so even though the RT X
20 80 does pack a higher TDP than its
predecessor I fully expected to make its
way to laptops at around 150 watt TDP
in the end now the question becomes what
sort of specs and performance can we
expect of the RT X 2080 and laptops well
with the GT X 1080 the
laptop and desktop variants were
identical so the same core configuration
same clock speeds same memory and
provided the cooling performance was
adequate the laptop 1080 performed on
par with the desktop 1080 in the video
it does seem very keen on offering
laptop versions of their GPS that are
equivalent to the desktop version so I
expect that to continue with the RT X
2080 in other words I fully expect the
laptop ITX 2080 to have 2944 CUDA cores
with boost clocks in the 1710 megahertz
range and it will still use 8gig of GDD
are 6 memory as for real-world
performance we're still not sure how the
cars will perform in the desktop so it's
hard to say for certain but we expect
the Arctic's 2080 to perform around the
level of the GT X 1080 Ti and NVIDIA x'
own charts show a 30 to 40 percent
performance improvement over the GTX
1080 in best-case scenarios so for
top-end laptops
getting a 35 percent performance bump
also in the same form factor is
certainly quite a tasty proposition how
would Nvidia manage to get this
performance boost from roughly the same
TDP well chewing is built using TSM CS
12 nanometer process compared to 16
nanometers for Pascal that's not a huge
change in Nvidia has chosen not to
shrink the die on twelve nanometer but
instead use I guess the wider pathways
that 12 nanometers provides however the
slight process improvement should bring
a more favorable voltage to frequency
curve so running cheering at the same
frequencies as Pascal should consume
less power
at least in theory and we saw something
like this in practice with second gen
rise and moving from 40 nanometers to 12
nanometers it could run at lower
voltages for the same frequencies so
when you look at the r-tx 2080 compared
to the GTX 1080 boost clocks are pretty
similar 1710 megahertz for the 2080
and 17 33 megahertz for the 1080 with
cheering on 12 nanometer it should
require less voltage to run at that
frequency compared to Pascal but then
the r-tx 2080 bumps up the CUDA coil
count from 2560 to 2944 so it's a wider
GPU at the same clocks so it looks like
nvidia has gained some power Headroom by
not increasing the clock speed of the
artex 2080
and put that towards making the GP
whiner with the end result being similar
power consumption for the 2080 and 1080
and that is good news for laptops where
TDP is much more important than with
desktops it's a pretty similar story
with the RT X 2070 in video lists a
desktop TV P of 175 watts factor in
virtual link possibly increasing the TDP
and the 2070 should pull back to around
150 watts the same TDP as the desktop
1070 and again the laptop version of the
1070 set around 115 Watts so I expect
the laptop RT x 2070 to be rated for
something similar the laptop version of
the 1070 was a bit of an enigma in that
it was different to the desktop 1070 in
terms of specifications but performed
around the same the laptop variant had
2048 CUDA cores and a boost clock of
1640 5 megahertz compared to 1920 CUDA
cores in the desktop rate with a boost
clock of 1683 megahertz Nvidia could do
something similar with the laptop 2070
but I think the case of the 1070 was
fairly unique and I don't really expect
them to follow that exact path again at
the same TDP the RT X 2070 should be
able to provide more performance than
the gtx 1070 so again whatever laptops
that could support the 1070 TDP they'll
be able to bump that up to an RT X 2070
and get more performance in the same
form factor and that would be great news
for more of our game users a lot of
fairly compelling laptops were able to
handle the 10 70s TDP and I think again
this will be the sweet spot for high
performance gaming laptops how they get
this extra performance is basically the
same as the RT X 2080 the 27 T is
clocked around the same level as the GTX
1070 but it includes 2304 cuda cores
compared to 2048 all thanks to the small
chip from 16 nanometers to 12 nanometers
on paper that's a 12 percent performance
jump not sure what we'll be getting in
practice just yet but it's looking
unlikely the 27 t will reach the level
of the GTX 1080
that said any performance increase in
the same form factor is very welcome in
constrained laptops
it's trickier to predict what will
happen to the tensor cause an RT course
in laptop versions of the RT X 28 e and
27 t considering ray tracing is the
flagship feature of these GPUs I fully
expect the laptop various to support ray
tracing
bomb so that will mean these cause will
need to be on the die and active weather
in video will disable some tents or RT
cause to save power
I'm not sure though it would be the most
obvious candidate for power savings at
the end of the day though ray tracing is
extremely computationally intensive so
if your video really wants to promote
this features being supported by their
laptop GPUs they'll probably have to
keep the RT cause fully enabled it will
certainly be interesting to see how that
pans out and what power implications it
has I also expect Nvidia to continue the
trend of offering max-q variants of the
RT X 2070 and RT X 2080 I know there are
plenty of people out there that dislike
max-q is they think it's some form of
artificially restricting their GPU from
reaching its full potential
blue reality it's actually quite a good
idea for laptops and other cooling
restricted systems the key thing max-q
does is provide a wider range of GPUs
that sit at different EVPs this allows a
manufacturer to choose a GPU that's
better suited to their cooling solution
for example a laptop might have more
than enough thermal Headroom for an RC X
2070 but not enough for an RT X 2080
instead of capping that system to RTX
2070 performance that system could
integrate an RT X 2080 max-q
at a TDP between the 27 and 28 offering
better performance in the 2070
but not quite the same level as the 2080
but still being within the cooling
solution that they have designed with
the GeForce 10 serious max cube variants
of the 1080 and 1071 clocked around 250
to 300 megahertz are lower than their
fully fledged counterparts while using
the exact same GPU with the same core
configuration and memory the clock
speeds were chosen such that the GPU is
operating an optimal frequency on
Pascal's voltage frequency curve giving
the best efficiency I expect something
very similar with the GeForce 20 series
we'll get an art X 2070 max Q and
that'll be clocked around 250 megahertz
lower that will sit between the 20 70
and an as yet announced 2060 and then
the art X 2018 max Q also be clocked
around 250 megahertz lower to sit
between the 2070 and 28 again just
speculation but that's what I expect
will happen usually the max cube
variants are 10% faster than the GPU
below them and 10
slower than the non max-q model but
we'll wait to see how that one plays out
as for pricing we know if the desktop
cards that the GeForce 20 series is
pretty expensive with prices above their
10 series counterparts and it's unlikely
they will offer as good value
considering what we know about their
performance so far with the laptop
versions it will probably be a very
similar story better performance in the
same form factor but also considerably
higher prices an RT X 2070 laptop will
likely cost at least $100 more than gtx
1070 laptops and that margin will be
higher for RT x 2080 laptops compared to
JT x 1080 laptops we are expecting
better performance in the same sort of
designs but for some buyers that may not
justify the price increase that said
laptops are sold as entire systems
rather than a standalone GPUs so the
value proposition when you compare
entire system prices might end up being
a bit more favorable than on the desktop
side comparing standalone cards I'm
definitely excited to see what Nvidia
does with the GeForce 20 series and
laptops and how much more performance we
can get in the same form factors I think
these GPUs could offer a bit more a
laptop buys than desktop system builders
considering laptops are constrained in
way as desktops are not on any
performance games without making laptops
chunkier and less portable is always
welcome that's it for this discussion
though I'll be interested to see how the
mobile versions of the ITX 2070 and 2080
actually end up but it sounds like left
to wait until later in the year to find
out for sure stay tuned for our coverage
of the desktop card that's coming up in
