yeah apparently I never say in the
videos but Steve's just told you all how
I am so welcome back to the part 2 of
our was it now February QA yeah I think
we've just squeezed in here at the end
with with the Q&amp;amp;A series so make sure
you go back and watch part 1 before part
2 lots of good questions in there lots
good questions to come up so yeah let's
get into it ok an interesting question
here that was heavily uploaded I believe
I had a look at the comments thread and
I think this one was near the top do you
recall yeah I think so I think this was
very very heavily uploaded the question
goes is it weird that those are reviews
that have tested the radion 7 with the
2,700 X have better results than the
majority room tested with the no no okay
I haven't seen that so I'm going to take
your word for it
I obviously tested with the night oh
okay but that's interesting
I'm actually really intrigued to look
into that like I said I know nothing of
it we've found in the past that Radeon I
sorry Rison CPUs perform better with
Radio and GPUs than they do with GeForce
GPUs but AMD GPUs performing better on
AMD CPUs opposed to Intel CPUs is a new
one for me I haven't come across that
before so potentially weird I'll have to
look into that and get back to you guys
and see if I'd love if you could point
out if anyone's actually done testing to
actually just occurring to me now that I
may have the answer for this question
it could just be that the 2700 X is
bottlenecking
yeah I was gonna suggest that the GPUs
yeah I didn't really want to say that
the 2700 bottleneck base cards because
very unlikely that would but if he's
trying to compare to a 20 atti at 1080p
it likely will though no I the Radeon 7
would be compared to the RT X 2080 yeah
and there's no way you're testing those
cards at 720p I imagine the reviews
would be looking at forty or forty P to
make any difference there that's right
yeah so that's a bit strange
I'd have to see this
settings they're using in the games
they're testing with it doesn't really
make sense to me at all and the only
scenario where I could say that would be
the cases of 2700 X's bottlenecking
the r-tx 2080 but if it's very very
strange because they deliver the same
performance anyway yeah but I'll look
into it all right Steve yeah what's been
your favorite game to benchmark
benchmark that's a weird one it's kind
of strange when you've played the same
game in the same spot for 60 seconds
thousands of times over I don't think it
really matters too much they're all kind
of similar in that regard you just do
your pass and that's it so my favorite
you get I don't know if I couldn't
really say a favorite one because like I
said they're all pretty much the same
except my favorites would be the games
that don't have a million splash screens
don't take forever and a day to load so
I can just click the icon the game loads
up in a reasonable amount of time I can
get to where I need to test it has save
points that helps that helps a lot it
has say multiple saved game points you
can make multiple files and run your
testing that way because games where
there's like a checkpoint every buddy 20
seconds is a nightmare
and then like Rainbow six siege takes
forever to open absolutely it takes so
long to load on any CPU it's like an
internet thing or something gonna know
but yeah games load quick question for
Steve I guess I'll take care of that I
thought an AMD getting sued for their
definition of a CPU core and regards
that FX processors it's all a bit silly
isn't it really I don't really know what
to say on that one too much did you
touch on that in news corner ah maybe a
while back yeah it's it's I mean it's
it's really hard to even get into it's
kind of like the whole what we were
talking about with the RT X stuff like
my opinion if I'm evaluating RT X now on
its own it's very different to how
critical I would have been having
evaluated on the promise of a month long
pre-order that this is going to be
amazing if you get what I mean so
it's like if you saw like was there even
a pre-order period for FX processes so
there was you could easily research them
and see how they performed in your
workload and who cares how many calls it
has you really just like it if I told
you the nice to hear ok had 30 cause but
then you check to the performance of it
and you're like well it performs like
what I expect out of an ant call process
no then I know it's all just a bit silly
all of it silly I think yeah probably
don't need to bash the FX processes this
QA let's try and break that alright fair
enough I think there's another question
here for me could you explain the
differences between greater gray
response times and input latency and his
grade response time any way related to
refresh rate so the input latency is how
long it takes from the signal from your
GPU to go well it doesn't really count
the cable but once it hits the start of
the monitor so once it comes out of the
cable into the monitor and then when it
starts to transition on to your screen
that is the input latency is how long it
takes for it to take the input and then
start delivering you the image that
simple latency the greater grow response
time is how quickly the pixels
themselves can do the change so after
the input has been processed it's ready
to be displayed how long can the
crystals physically change in the
display so that's why you normally see a
curve like this because it's a that's
just basically at work so yeah the
Griego response knows how long it takes
for the pixels to change the input main
sees how long it takes to process and
yes great a gray response time someone's
at the door maybe delivering me a parcel
yes greater gray response times are
related to the refresh rate they tend to
be slower at lower refresh rates alright
another question do you think it's a
monitor question I'm gonna minute guys
how do you recline these things again
Tim Andy's monitors let me know you go
to your weight net when you're done
I'm sure you could input on this one do
you think that 21:9 will ever officially
replace 69 the same way 69 overtook for
3 movies have been using 29 for a long
time no more games were officially
supporting more opportunity as a
is the domination of 21:9 inevitable
what was a question sir
very professional maybe I don't think
it's right for everyone because it is
quite wide so I guess it just depends on
the use case I think 16:9 overtook 4:3
simply because made a lot more sense for
some types of content was I don't think
21 is a clear cut makes more sense / 69
is the military helicopters coming we've
been battling with this Q&amp;amp;A yeah the
Melbourne airshow is on the on the
weekend that right yeah that's right so
military helicopters they're delivering
the military helicopters to the airshow
right over my head yes very very loud
yes it's for you knowing so well we'll
come back to this question in a moment
helicopters overhead get in the chopper
all right back to normal business the
helicopters been delivered to the
airfield 21 9 over 69 gear yeah I just
think that it's not gonna be suitable
for everyone's use case oh thank you
I'm just advocating for 16 10 to combat
16 10 16 10 so yeah I just think it
depends on the amount of space you have
what you're looking for words yeah 4 3
seem to die pretty quick one once people
realize that wider and that regard is
better but yes oh I don't think it'll
become as widespread but will still be
an option for a long time
all right question I'm sorry again one
of our longtime discord members what are
your thoughts on rendering features like
dynamic resolution scaling and temporary
construction tech like checkerboard
rendering that the consoles make use of
and do you think both should become
industry standard options across most if
not all games on PC as well why don't
any reason not to include features like
this there's you know it doesn't do
anything wrong you can choose to enable
it or disable it so yeah there's
definitely no reason not to experiment
with things like this I think for PCs
those features need to be better than
they are for consoles simply because
with a PC you're viewing your lorem too
close you're more likely to notice
artifacts the console gaming you're
mostly on a couch
sit back from your TV it's harder to
spot some of the issues with those
technologies I think they're coming a
long way though and they certainly could
make their way to pieces
I've reasonably assumed without much of
a quality loss so I think it's something
that should be explored and yeah there's
no real no real negative to including
them ok question here why do you think
AMD screwed up the Radeon 7 launch did I
say they've screwed it up wasn't a
particularly exciting or great launch I
think they screwed it up or maybe they
did with the availability which is the
next part so the card is not available
mm-hmm
there are a lot of problems at launch
too expensive at the moment like 800
plus dollars where I live power
consumption and noise to handle manually
I think you means you have to sort of
manually adjust those things to get them
under control so manual fan curve under
volt if you can and don't forget the no
UEFI support why is aim D unable to
properly launch something like this a
lot of these issues seem so obvious to
fix to you and I do you have any hope
for Navi well I don't think they screwed
up the launch it wasn't a smooth launch
they certainly could have done better
and yeah I mean they would have been a
lot better off delaying the car by a
week or two to get the press driver
sorted out the press driver was an
absolute I can't use that language it
was a mess no it was an absolute mess
and it was bad in all games the second I
started testing I ran into troubles I
reached that state from gamers Nexus and
he said I haven't started testing yet
I'll let you know if I run into any
problems he said I'll be testing in
about an hour about an hour later he
gets back to me this is a nightmare so I
don't know what kind of level of testing
they did to validate that driver ready
for press but it's kind of a big deal
that you get press a working stable
reliable driver that performs as it
should so yeah I mean that's where they
screwed up that it would have been our
review would have been good if we didn't
have to include all that nonsense but
thankfully the public driver was
perfectly fine so I suppose that's
equally important if not more so then
the things like the noise that's
annoying I would have rather yeah they
made the card run five degrees hotter
and be a bit quieter that probably
would've been a better balance there
the fan curve could have definitely done
with some basic tweaking so I agree with
you there that's something that I think
all of us will agree on as for the power
consumption I'm not sure there's too
much they can do there again we talked
about those problems in a previous
comment earlier question yeah then the
UAF is that stuff that was a an
unfortunate oversight but yeah I think I
think to say why you know is that AMD
unable to launch things like this
properly is a little bit unfair
considering the juggernauts that they're
up against I think for the most part
they do do a pretty good job that makes
my choices at times but you know who
knows how these companies think yeah I I
don't think I don't think I overall it
was a total screwup I think the Radeon 7
is okay it just fails to really excite
the current price I think that's pretty
much end of it another question from our
discord chat here so I've just been
watching the big benchmark video for the
16 60 TI if the graph versus the 1070 we
can see the 16 60 TI falling behind the
1070 in roughly 50% of the games do you
have any theories about why this is the
case is it the sixth gigabyte frame
buffer already showing its limitations
oh okay no definitely not that I talked
about that oh i looted - it probably
didn't get into it that clearly but the
main reason is there's a big difference
in critical count there so if they both
have the same amount of criticals so if
they both had nineteen hundred and
twenty criticals they would both deliver
well worst case the Turing GPU would be
this would deliver the same level of
performance that would be worst case but
best case it would be much faster so I
think it's 1536
sounds about right yep CUDA calls for
the gtx 660ti so yeah it's got quite
there is quite a difference there in
critical count so the fact that it
overall delivers the same performance is
yeah speaks to the improvements they've
made with deterring architecture alright
next question here I think this one's a
bit of a news cornerguy question but
I'll just sort of read between the lines
on this one Intel's now starting to
promote their new or their upcoming
first ever
discreet grandpa's connection it's not
the first direction and said that but
anyway they're starting to promote a new
one their new graphics card when do you
guys think or your sources say sources
that's funny when would it be a
reasonable launch window for this new
product
when will the cards be targeting market
arrival i yeah no idea no I'd you're on
that one I should this was a heavily up
very comment which is why yeah I mean
it's kind of seems like 2020 still yeah
we don't really have any what tier who
knows yeah I mean it's way too early for
any of this stuff to be discussed in any
detail
we just don't know yeah I mean we would
definitely expect Intel to be promoting
this stuff from well out because you
know this is a new segment for them
starting to get to be aware that they're
actually doing this aware so that when
they eventually launch the people I'm
just like oh wow look at that you know
that people can be hyped about it but
certainly I wouldn't be expecting
anytime soon yes so we don't speak to
Intel too much directly there's not
really much representation for them in
Australia where they talk to the media
and then board partners haven't said a
thing so yep not nothing to go on there
alright
cheesy game from YouTube is asking us
all the most important questions here ah
a hard brush next how many times did X
give it to you while playing Resident
Evil 2
I didn't play enough for president fire
I planted oh yeah yeah he gave it to me
a few times that's for sure alright
another quick question here is it better
to have 16 gigabytes of memory in single
channel or a gigabytes in dual channel
for gaming especially if you got Rison
that's truly until I would rather have 8
gigabytes in dual channel rather than 16
gigabytes in single channel so you
thinking about single channel would be a
pretty weird unusual configuration you'd
have to have hmm it's more common than
you think on laptops though oh that's
that's true
you know there's big big performance
boosts from dual channel there wasn't
once upon a time but there really is now
so I would rather have less memory but
have it in dual channel with more
bandwidth
okay with more developers embracing
DirectX 12 DirectX technology well yeah
we'll get to that a moment do you think
we're gonna see a return of dual GPU
cards in the next two years definitely
not no they're dead
no general GPU cards are dead SLI is
dead costs five dead they're all people
get a few people get really upset when I
say that but yeah I don't know anyways
the issue with DirectX 12 is that it's
actually harder to him to implement dual
GPU support with sure it's on the
developers they can do whatever they
want with the dual GPUs they can do all
sorts of crazy techniques but it's it's
less straightforward because with with
DirectX 11 it was just you just use the
standard what was it called multi frame
rendering technique or whatever was used
for yeah yeah DirectX 11 basically that
was a driver level feature you could
just enable it yeah some games it
obviously didn't work but it was a lot
simpler to enable that feature for
DirectX 11 was DirectX 12 putting on the
developers they have to do their own
coding it the lack of jewell GPU rigs
it's just yeah it's just not gonna
happen
it was very promising and looked great
with ashes of the singularity they did
some phenomenal work there with even
better use GeForce a Radeon GPUs
combining them it was really cool but
yeah those guys did some impressive work
with the game engine that we just six
then two other games all right final
question and we didn't actually mention
his q and A's but we're going through
another another heat wave in Melbourne
what is going on every time we do a QA
there's another heat wave so it was like
low 20s yesterday and it's now that
messes yeah getting into the high 30s
Celsius and there's no aircon in here so
yeah I'm starting to stick to the desk
so thankfully we're on the last question
but yeah we've been going through a lot
of water in between questions and this
is another really important question
that we've definitely never answered
before in the Q&amp;amp;A series what car do you
drive daily it's really weird that you
guys asked is what cars we drive because
we're youtubers so it's obvious yeah
I've got a Lamborghini
yeah so Tim's only been doing YouTube
for a year now so a years not enough to
get a Lamborghini but he's got a
high-end hour
and then two years is the Lamborghini
yeah I'm thinking it'll land beginning
for the track
yeah then making it out he just my daily
driver yeah I think it's a sensible way
of going about the car thing yep so yeah
I've been using mine on the road some
not very fuel-efficient and yeah wrap up
the miles on my Lambo
but seriously I Drive a very exciting
diesel Passat so I don't have a master
seek so it's not much more exciting so
that's what we drive yeah thanks for
watching all right and that's it for the
February Q&amp;amp;A series two parts make sure
you've watched all of them because both
of them are pretty good I reckon lots of
fantastic questions that you guys asked
us both our discord which by the way you
get access to our discord if you sign up
to our patreon so that's a nice little
coke there but also on the YouTube
community tab as well some good stuff
there on YouTube don't forget to
subscribe so I guess that's it we'll be
back for another Q&amp;amp;A next month until
then I guess we'll see you next time
who you bomb Tim again probably the
fourth tire I've mentioned this in the
in the Q&amp;amp;A series so far and I'm your
host Steve see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
