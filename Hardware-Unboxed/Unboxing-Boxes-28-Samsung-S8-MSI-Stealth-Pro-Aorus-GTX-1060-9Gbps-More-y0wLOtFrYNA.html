for another episode of unboxing boxes I
feel like I've been doing one of these
every week for a while now we've had
plenty of stuff to get through as you
feed today we've got five boxes slash
packages so we'll get straight into them
won't waste any time with any updates or
anything straight into it I'll move this
one over here and it's pretty obvious
what this is I'll give you guys I'll
look actually quite excited to get into
this and the wet bench so for those of
you who don't know this is the Praxis
wet bench praxis is a brand of primo
chill you guys p√∫blico de primera chill
I believe they're us-based
anyway haven't had much to do with them
but I first saw this beauty at the
upgrade Australia 5.0 event a few weeks
ago now those of you who watched that
video would have seen what I'm talking
about I'll throw some b-roll up for
those that didn't but basically I went
past the ple Computers booth and I had a
very cool looking test bench setup which
I comment in the video I very much liked
anyway those guys are really cool as it
turns out because they reached out to me
and said Steve do you want one I've
course said yes and they promptly got me
one so here we are so inside we have a
nice bit of foam with what looks like
probably the instruction manual and all
the bits for the test fed bench
there's a lot of layers okay so as you
can see I have the white version I
believe it's what white and black this
version looks like it's mostly white
actually it could be all white it
actually matches my the tower 100 bill
very nicely not the two are going
together or anything
here we go I believe to these yeah this
is the black
so the acrylic pieces are black they
would be the side panels and you can
mount pumps and things on them and run
tubing through them so very cool towards
the end of the show I'll probably put
this together and show you guys I'll do
a separate video anyway on this I think
it's very cool but we've got a bit to
get through so I won't waste too much
time just yet be a big thanks to the
guys at ple computers for sending this
out for me to use for one of my test
systems probably do a risin system or
something with this as I understand it
in the US you can get this the wet bench
in it's like it over a dozen different
color options here in Australia right
now purely computers I believe the only
retailer that are selling the wet bench
and they have it in the white black or
the red black models and they're selling
them for $270 Australian which is pretty
pricey for a test bench but because it's
such a sort of a custom thing the
pricing generally is fairly high on them
and it's 185 u.s. anyway so there's not
really a huge markup or anything for it
being sold in Australia so if you guys
are after a really cool test bench that
can take advantage of liquid cooling all
that sort of stuff probably a lot like
what you see on J's $0.02 channel then
this would be the thing they get they'll
set this up soon we'll take a good look
at it so now we'll move on
right so this next item I know what's in
this so I won't keep you in suspense it
is my new samsung s h plus phone and
those that follow me on Twitter will
probably know quite a few weeks ago I
actually got my samsung s H plus this is
another one it is a replacement so here
we go brand-new replacement s8 plus why
do I have a replacement s8 plus well
here is my current s8 plus new one T and
it has a dirty big chip outside of it or
it's more of a part of the screens
pretty much missing it has six huge
hairline fractures I'll get some b-roll
close-ups of that and it's also got a
bit of a blow on the back of it as well
so yeah for those of you that follow me
on Twitter you will see that I got this
a few weeks ago and I was mighty
impressed super excited I opened up cos
I'm not really a phone guy level that
stuff to Tim I use my phone for Twitter
messaging and phone calls not a whole
lot of stuff really I don't spend much
time on it mainly because I'm usually at
my desktop PC but when I'm out about
traveling it is good to have a really
good phone especially something of a
good camera so you can do those
Instagram shots and tweets and whatnot
so I wanted to upgrade to this from my
note 4 which I don't actually have on me
right now but my note 4 I did for two
and a half years and I dropped the hell
out of that thing properly over that
time it had a dozen good Falls no
scratches really definitely no cracks
it's in perfect working order it's got a
couple little bruises around the edges
on the on the frame but nothing major
it's got one dent in the back of it but
because it's a textured plastic backing
that's not a problem yeah I'd say the
phones in really really good operating
condition really liked it loved that
phone it served me well but you know the
camera and it's not great this is a huge
improvement so pick this thing up
straight away the phone just feels
amazing even though it it's a bit
slippery with the glass all around it
some kind of like I'd like it to picking
up a bar of soap at times it's that bad
you can't pin it in here it just wants
to slide out the whole time so you can't
sort of fit in here and do the you've
definitely got to put it on speakerphone
so it's something to be aware of and
you've got to be really careful picking
up because it is a slippery sucker but
it does feel incredibly nice very very
premium and of course the screen just
looks amazing there's no phone really
out there that competes with it in terms
of its screen performance is great
like I said videos photos all fantastic
or and great phone and you will if
you've watched pretty much any reviews
you will have heard reviewers raving
about how good it is the problem is it's
pretty much the most fragile phone I
think it is the most fragile phone to
ever be create and that's keeping
iPhones in mind as well it makes those
things look like tanks even the smallest
slightest slip up and you're going to
have a bad day with this thing even the
slimline cases I've seen people have the
sling cases on them drop them from less
than the meter and that still shattered
the screen so I've got this big bulky
thing which I don't even really think
will protect it from a decent fall
anyway however how I broke mine probably
should let you guys know that I had it
in my pocket I was sitting in my desk
chair and a fairly low setting I would
have my backside would have only been
about 40 centimeters off the ground and
I have carpet so yeah it's fallen out of
my pocket because like I said it's like
it's on wheels basically when it's in
your pocket it just flies out of there
it's that slippery there's nothing to
slow it down so it's fluid out of my
pocket I didn't even hear or feel it
coming out of my pocket the first I knew
about it was when I hit the ground and I
hit my plastic caster wheel before I hit
the carpet and it obviously caught the
screen right on the edge and it
shattered in a big way you can feel the
hairline fractures the whole way through
the screen when you're swiping and stuff
yeah the phone was something four days
old and it's an $1,100 at least an
$1,100 ozzie phone and yet it lasted me
four days
tiny fall from forty centimeters onto
plastic and it shattered the screen and
I was so disappointed and pissed off at
the time that I picked it up and I
literally decide onto my desk and crack
to the back hey I don't know what it hit
on my desk I think it was the edge of my
keyboard it was just literally like what
you just saw then yeah it's pretty
pathetic how fragile it is I don't know
if any of you guys have hopped over to
square trades channel had
look at their Galaxy s8 drop test just
to show how fragile our phone is their
chance was kind of extreme they test a
six foot control drop landing on the
screen and in the back both times it
looked like the thing had been to war
and back it was just looked like I had
bullet holes all over the over it was
just a complete mess and they say it's
the most fragile phone they've ever seen
I did a bit of googling what I did break
it to see if there was any relatively
cost-effective ways of replacing it
turns out there wasn't but while
researching I came across quite a few
stories use swords that were quoting
repair outlets saying that they're just
absolutely loving these things their
business is booming they've never seen a
new phone released and then such a quick
turnaround time but it's large volumes
of cracked screens so again they were
confirming they're just unbelievably
fragile and it's at least starting price
I think it's at least 300 Australian
dollars to replace the screen I did have
insurance online which I pay $15 a month
for it was still two hundred and twenty
dollars with Telstra so yeah that's
fantastic so it cost me two hundred and
twenty dollars to get a replacement
phone after four days yeah I was already
up for more than $200 to replace it so I
won't be keeping it pretty much want to
get rid of it or replace it with the new
LG or something more durable I'll go to
speak to Tim work out something that's
better but it's really disappointing
because otherwise I just love the phone
it's so so nice to use it functions
really well it just has zero durability
rating so yeah very disappointing but
I've got my new one now hopefully I'm
going to put in a thick case so if you
guys have one and know of a good case
that I can get because I needed to
supply up the week at Computex and right
now I'm terrified to pick it up it's
just the most impractical thing to have
in your life just hopeless so I'm
looking forward to getting rid of it and
getting something else see I mean the
reviews aren't bad on them the reviewers
are alright as long as you don't drop it
you're good to go but yeah I don't want
to phone in my life for any item in my
life or have to treat it that carefully
because there is going to be a slip-up
here and there like I said I've over the
two and a half years up my note for
probably a dozen slip-ups over that time
things happen as they say really I
wouldn't recommend this phone I feel
cheated buying this it's just it really
is rubbish it's that's that fragile it's
not practical it's yeah it's not you I
mean like I said the camera on it's
amazing it's good for what I do but it's
completely useless because if I dropped
it from here to my desk it would
probably shatter the screen there's a
high probability of that happening
that's not really good enough so I
wouldn't recommend anyone get the new
Samsung Galaxy s8 plus I'd recommend you
avoid it like the plague so a lot of
people can be upset that I've said that
but yeah I'm going to get rid of mine
that's my honest opinion I know Tim will
be reviewing one shortly and he'll
probably be going over how all great the
features are like other reviewers have
but he will be noting that it's
extremely fragile and just be aware of
that if you are going to have one that
there's a good chance at some point
you're going to break it unless you have
a giant case so just to give you an
example I mean this I'm not saying this
is a fantastic case or anything it's
something I just grabbed off eBay
because I didn't want to take this
anywhere without it being in a case so
I've got this big rubberized thing that
wraps around and you see how big and
bulky and ugly it makes the phone I've
never ever understood the point of cases
I do not get them why buy a phone that
needs one of these to survive just buy a
durable phone like my note for that
thing is pretty tough to break I gave it
I mean I'm not I'm not super careless
but I gave it a bit of a hard time I
don't treat my phone like it's a
precious gem and yeah that's just crap
why would you put a sleek nice brand-new
phone in something like that so like I
said if you guys know of a good case
that isn't like this let me because I
would like to put this in it lastly I
did come across a reddit post which I
shouldn't say is funny because it's
exactly my experience but only a few
days after the phone was released the
user jumped on reddit and there's dozens
upon dozens probably hundreds upon
hundreds of stories like this on the
internet now you don't have to dig too
far into the Google search results to
find tons of people complaining about
smashing their Sh screen but like I said
mine slipped out of my pocket hit a
caster wheel and hit the ground from 40
centimeter drop it was but obviously
landed on the edge which is a very very
weak fragile point of the phone
this user said I love this phone it's
exceeded my wildest expectations however
I dropped my phone from less than a foot
and it has shattered called a couple of
phone shops and none of them fix it yet
absolutely devastated has anyone else
broken their screen and got it fixed and
then another guy you know this is only a
couple of days like less than a week
after release and this user says I
cracked my screen - but he already got
it replaced he paid one hundred and
forty eight dollars us which is about
two hundred on Australian which is
pretty similar to what I paid to have
mine replaced and then you go on there's
a few other people in here saying
they've cracked their shadow Dez totally
destroyed theirs and they're what they
all have in common is extremely small
drops they're not likely a six foot drop
that our square trailer did it's just
yeah
literally half desk height onto fairly
soft surfaces and they're shattering now
you a enough whinging about the s8 plus
I'll solve that issue by getting rid of
mine hopefully in the not too distant
future alright still really can you put
that test bed together but we'll move on
okay let's go are with this box here see
what we got in here need something to
make me feel better about just wasting
three hundred and twenty dollars on a
phone I just bought well that's going to
do it I love getting a Norris graphics
card in the mail and it's the new GTX
1069 gear bits per second model so
that's going to cheer me up a bit I
think I'll get into that and have a look
as you guys know I did pick the R X 480
over the GTX 1060 and I was using the
Auris brand rx 580 which is still here
it is still floating around so this is
the card I picked over the 1069 gierek's
for second card I didn't have the Auris
version because I obviously just
received that so it might be interesting
to do for the review a bit of a
head-to-head with these two here we go
okay so it's a very different design
probably should not throw in that boxed
anyway okay so I'd say there's a beefier
cooler on the RX 5 OD card gigabyte of
horse have stepped up their game on the
Radeon cards that's pretty impressive
this is definitely a more streamline
model they're both ok so this one's
through actually a three slot cooler
whereas the Nvidia card is a true slot
cooler so yeah more streamlined more
slim and obviously just a single 8-pin
connector you've still got that little
copper insert in the back the back
plates are actually quite similar not
the same but similar does cover the
whole length of the PC UV so the Auris
GTX 1069 gigabits per second model this
is selling for 400 us so the 90 beats
per second 10 60s which I found to offer
really nothing over the 8 gigabits per
second models they're selling for quite
a hefty premium that isn't really
justified when it comes to performance
and I don't see the card selling for
four hundred and sixty-five dollars of
these so yeah very pricey card I believe
that makes it a bit more expensive or
quite a bit more expensive than this big
Oris rx 580 this one does have a I think
the core clock out of the box is
overclocked by 9%
sixteen hundred and forty-five megahertz
and I think that results in a boost
frequency of 1870 ish I think it's 73
from memory and I think that's again
that's about 10 percent overclock so out
of the box you could expect at best up
to about 10 percent over a stock card
not that there is a Founders edition
nine cubits a second 10 60 so yeah
anyway it's a it's a good-looking card
it's nice and slim it should fit into
tightest spots in the rx5 a TiVo it is a
fraction longer a couple of year longer
shorter in the height Department and as
I said it's a whole slot you know not
that you can have these in SLI or
anything like that anyway whereas you
can have these in crossfire there you go
perhaps a horas comparison between these
two in the works
yeah we'll see alright time to have a
look at what's in this little package ah
oh cool
did not know this was coming so got some
Crucial Ballistix memory here haven't
looked at this stuff for quite some time
so they are 16 gigabyte keeps each
dual-channel 16 GB but kids I believe
they've sent these for use with rising
platforms but not 100% sure on that I
imagine they are though so this is a
3200 kit 3000 kit I said they're both a
gigabyte modules pair of a cubit modules
in each kit both designed about at one
point 3 5 volts okay so the timings for
the 3,000 memory of 1516 1635 and for
the 3200 memory they are also 15 16 16
35 so this is slightly more premium
stuff which probably isn't that
surprising looking at the heat spreaders
on them and so this is ballistic
tactical ballistic ballistics tactical
and this would be their elite stuff I
believe ballistics elite or something
like that I don't recall and for some
reason the name isn't on the packet so
it's not helping me out at all
cabbage has called ballistics I don't
know anyway you will see these featured
in some builds shortly yeah okay last
but probably not least because it's the
biggest box we have here is another MSI
boxin looks like another laptop which is
interesting because inside just sent me
a laptop in the last episode wonder if
there's sent me the same laptop twice
that does happen you'd be surprised how
often that happens not from MSI just
from companies in general this is a
brand new laptop this one
that is a rare racing to get a brand-new
laptop review sample normally they're
all pretty well used by the time they
get to us other stealth pro okay well
this isn't the same as the one we got
last week one last week that's probably
giving you somehow reflection isn't it I
can just tell the one last week was the
Phantom Pro Phantom Pro you probably saw
the review of that last night anyway
enough waffling okay so this is a
similar SPECT machine to the Phantom Pro
though it is bigger that was a 14-inch
model this is 15.6 still an IPS
anti-glare panel full high-def so for
high definition so still 1080p it has
the 7700 HQ again we've got a geforce
gtx 1066 gigabyte so again that's the
same graphics card or GPU and then we
have a 256gb SSD I believe that's an
nvme so it's probably the same as the
other one and a one terabyte secondary
harddrive and 16 gigabytes of ddr4 so it
looks to be very similar just slightly
larger come on you can do it there we go
Packaging is are also identical holy
moly that is a thin laptop this the
laptop with it Wow
wow that is super nice holy moly
so that is a seriously thin gaming
laptop so that has a core i7 7700 and a
GTX 1060 but it's got what looks like a
massive heat sink in it for a quite long
there and there so that's probably the
GPU side CPU side there also there's
ventilation on both sides as well and
you can see heat sink things running so
they're very multiple heat sinks in this
thing by the looks of it at least four
possibly five and a heap of connectivity
as well this thing looks amazing Wow for
such a thin laptop we have three USB
type a ports three in this side card
reader full-size Ethernet port dual
audio jacks are like how far forward
they are and then on the other side
another USB 3 or maybe that's a USB 2
could be a type 2 it's a type a anyway
so that's good for you know wireless
mouse or something hdmi displayport no
yes that's a display port and a type-c
connector so that would be and it's got
looks like a thunderbolt support there
and your power important the power
buttons hidden on the side is that's
quite nifty and with some let's peel
together the most satisfying part of any
expensive purchase here we go you ready
you ready satisfying now the moment I
touched this nice brush just like I did
there brushed aluminium panel it'll
never look the same again but in this
moment it looks quite spiffy indeed nice
flat brushed aluminium panel I'm not
really going to want to send this back
maybe I can convince them to leave it
with me so you guys leave a lot of
comments saying I think MSI should leave
this with Steve for future testing a lot
of those comments I want to see and then
that might convince them well it's got
like a suede bottom that's very nice
I'm really impressed with this thing I
think I'm going to have to do a review
on it I don't even think I'll Palm it
off to Tim I want to check this out I'm
actually pretty keen to see how the
gaming performance with the 1060 in this
thing is compared to our full Fire's
desktop that's quite incredible it's got
a steelseries keyboard and I just had a
look online and it is seventeen point
seven millimeters thick
so that's incredible it's uh that's
quite a bit thinner than the gigabyte
error if you've seen that Tim just
looked at and he was super impressive
that hasn't got the super slim bezel in
the bezel still quite slim but it's not
a Fiero 15 but ya wouldn't say it's got
a large bezel or anything like that yeah
I'm going to only go play with this
right now I think all right well that
about does it for this episode of
unboxing boxes I've got 32 gigs of
memory from crucial so that will be
going in a build you'll be seen that
soon I've got the new 9 gigabits per
second gtx 1060 the horas brand card and
I'll probably review these two together
cuz I haven't reviewed this car I did
feature it in the massive 27 game
comparison but I haven't done like a
board partner card review on it so let
me know what you guys think do you want
to separate reviews or would you like to
see these featured in the same review
side-by-side I think that could be kind
of cool something a bit different then I
put that awesome at wet bench test bed
I'm going to put that together right now
so hopefully you'll see some b-roll of
that in this video complete and then
when I get back from Computex I don't
think I'll have time this week so I've
still got to do that Coolermaster build
this week as well before I go to
competition there's a few other things
as well I've put into an RX 570 versus
10 63 gigabyte comparison it'll have
probably happened on the weekend anyway
a lot of stuff to do I also want to
review that I don't know probably at a
fit that in this week but I'm going to
start testing and using it tonight
playing some games I don't see no good
it is for the super impressive that I'll
probably take this to Computex with me
as well as that one because yeah that's
very cool yeah and then of course I've
got my new phone which I'm going to have
to pretty much just try and not drop so
see how that goes and then this one I
might have to do might actually do a
cheeky drop test with it before I mail
it back not that it's really necessary
don't drop these by any more than about
the length of the phone even then I
reckon if you stood it on its end like
that and let it fall forward under
something it would shatter totally
pathetic anyway that's kind of a rant a
miserable
downside of what's usually a
light-hearted segment be a big THANK YOU
to ple computers for sending out the
weight bench can't wait to put
together thank you to gigabyte for
sending that out but obviously just want
to review ha and msi for sending me this
laptop they probably want to review as
well but they're going to get one
because this thing looks cool so that's
it for this episode hope you guys
enjoyed it hope it wasn't too much
ranching and sort of miserable tone but
anyway I'm your host Steve I'll see you
again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
