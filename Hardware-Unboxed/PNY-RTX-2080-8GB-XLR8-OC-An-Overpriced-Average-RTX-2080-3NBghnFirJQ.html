checking out our first-ever P&amp;amp;Y product
on hair for testing is there RTX 2080
graphics card now this is the xlr8 you
see I believe that's accelerate OC we'll
go with accelerate anyway because it's a
lot easier to say so this is a dual slot
card it has two fans as you can see and
it is based on the reference PCB so it's
a bit of a standard affair but I do like
the fact that it is a dual slot card
because most of the dual fan models take
up two and a half or while they occupy
three PCI Express slots or three
expansion slots before we get too far
into this review I will just get one of
the bigger issues with this product out
of the way
just yeah deal with this one first and
that is the price for what is a very
basic looking r-tx 2080 graphics card
the pen way accelerate yeah it ain't
cheap it comes in at $800 u.s. which is
a series premium over the 700 other
models which are finally down to the
$700 MSRP so that's kind of nice but
yeah this one this one isn't it's also
50 dollars more than the bigger gigabyte
gaming OC version that we reviewed
almost three months ago now of course if
it can deliver similar thermal
performance that I guess the premium can
be somewhat justified for those seeking
a dual slot card though gigabyte does
have they've reinforced three model down
at $700 and it also only requires two
slots anyway before we put the card to
the test let's take a quick look at the
cooler and PCB design in total the car
weighs just 807 grams and that makes it
17% lighter than the gigabyte gaming OSI
model and 40% lighter than nvidias
founders Edition so this could make it
difficult for P and wise RT X 2080
accelerate to match the thermal
performance of the 2080s that we've
already tested the cooler that is to say
the heatsink and fans weighs in at 560
grams and that's 30% lighter than the
cooler featured on gigabytes Gaming OSI
model the cooler features a copper base
plate five copper pipes and two 85
millimeter fans pushing out over the
and heatsink the GDD r6 memory and vram
components are all cooled via the same
heatsink using aluminium contact plates
moving to the card itself we find it's
fairly standard in terms of dimensions
it's 265 millimeters long 110
millimeters tall and on the PCB we find
a very standard 8 + 2 phase vrm using on
semiconductor power stages and we also
find a standard 6 + 8 pin power
connector configuration then of course
we have that massive Turing and GPU
codename tu-104 400 a a 1 there's also 8
1 gigabyte GD - 6 memory chips providing
an 8 gigabyte vm buffer and the chips in
question of microns mtk 61k 256 m 32 je
- 14 a and this is of course their
fourteen gigabits per second memory
flipping the card over and unfortunately
we don't find a backplate a big
oversight for a card that cost $800 us
so yeah shame to see that okay so out of
the box accelerate OC comes with a core
clock speed of fifteen hundred and
fifteen megahertz resulting in a boost
frequency of eighteen hundred and
fifteen megahertz
that's said when gaming the frequency
held steady at eighteen hundred and
seventy-five megahertz which is the same
frequency our foundation model runs up
for those wondering the gigabyte gaming
OC maintained 1890 megahertz so really
not much difference there that said the
big difference can be seen when looking
at the temperature for a reference the
founders issue model hits 76 degrees in
the gaming OC picked at just 64 degrees
the accelerate you see on the other hand
though that only matched in videos Fe
model hitting 76 degrees we're still
while the fans on the gigabyte cards
spun at just 1400 RPM and whisper quiet
the fans on the pen wire card were
whizzing away at 2200 rpm and this makes
the unimpressive temperature well
even less impressive going all in I
decided to crank up the fans to full
speed which saw them spin at 3400 rpm
and here they were very loud as you
might expect that said this might be a
good option for headphone users as it
did drop the GPU temperature down to
just 61 degrees as for overclocking we
were able to maintain a clock speed of
2025 megahertz which is the same result
provided by the EFI model the
Josie went slightly higher at 2040
megahertz and as I've said in the past
it's more important to focus on the
operating temperature and board design
rather than the OSI result is that we
will vary depending on how well you do
with the Silicon lottery when just
quickly the GDD are six memory went up
from seventeen hundred and fifty
megahertz to nineteen hundred and twenty
five megahertz so there's a nice 10
percent boost they're finally throwing
on a few k-type thermocouple allowed us
to measure the surface temperature of
the power stages and GDD are six memory
our overclock using the auto fan speed
settings saw the vrm idle at 36 degrees
and the memory at 38 degrees then under
load the vrm hits 66 degrees and the
memory 71 degrees go through acceptable
temperatures but they are considerably
higher than what we saw with the
gigabyte gaming OC version okay so time
for some FPS performance and as usual
i'm using my corsair GPU test rig built
inside the crystal series v 7x packing a
core i7 87 okay clocked at 5 gigahertz
with 32 gigabytes of vengence ddr4 3400
memory I'm not gonna bother going over
many games for this one 3 will certainly
do these cards will deliver very similar
frame rates so it's a pretty boring
benchmark session so that being the case
let's just blast through these benchmark
results starting with battlefield one
here we see the same out-of-the-box
performance with the Pnyx i/o you see
that was seen previously with the
gigabyte gaming scene and video founders
Edition overclocked we also see similar
performance across the three cards
tested so nothing too exciting here
though 83 FPS on average at 4k using
ultra quality settings certainly is
impressive much the same as seen when
testing with strange brigade out of the
box the custom overclocked PMI
accelerate OC is able to match the
gigabyte gaming OC and found edition
models the custom overclock didn't boost
performance by much but it was enough to
keep frame rates above 60 FPS on our
test so that's kind of nice then last we
have shadow the Tomb Raider and you
guessed it comparable performance to
what we've already seen but I suppose
that's a good thing not much more to say
here Elise let's focus on the power
consumption for use as you might have
expected at this point the power
consumption of the PNY accelerate OC is
comparable to that our previously tested
our GX 2080 graphics cards overclocking
only increased total system drop by 6
percent at least in a
three tests so that's very reasonable
and out of the box are consumed less
power than the found edition model okay
so time to wrap this up what do I make
of the P and why accelerate oh you see a
graphics card well it's pretty average
if I'm honest it's one redeeming feature
I would say is the fact that it is a
dual slot card though even that is a bit
questionable I'm not exactly sure if
it's any better than gigabytes win for
three version which currently sells for
$700 so there's $100 cheaper and yeah
that's also a dual slot card so I can't
say for sure if this is better than
gigabytes version but I kind of doubt it
based on what we've seen even if they
are very similar in terms of cooling
performance there's no getting around
the fact that the P my card costs $100
more that's a serious price premium for
the same money you can pick out
gigabytes phenomenal looking or at
extreme or how about so tax massive and
perdition or for $50 let's get em sis
Ventus or heck even gigabytes gaming Oh
see that we called on for comparison
multiple times in this video point is
there is a boatload of options for
prospective r-tx 2080 buyers and many of
them are either much cheaper or just
better equipped for the $700 MSRP the
PMI excite OC would be a decent enough
offering but at $800 it's a hard pass
for now the cooler really just isn't
good enough the overall design is very
basic and the card lacks a backplate the
i/o panel is very standard it uses the
reference PCB design and it feels like
the RGB light bar thing has just been
included so they can stick RGB on the
box
hang on a minute I have to take that
back there's actually no mention of a
ogtp on the box at all
let's try their website no no mention of
RGB light bar thingy there either though
there is a picture of it all lit up
something that I wasn't actually able to
experience I mean in any color other
than green yeah so get this there is no
way to control the RGB light bar by
default it's meant to just color cycle
you know the classic rainbow effect but
for some reason mine was just stuck on
green pmy has no ETA for when owners if
there are TX cards we've got to modify
the lighting so no idea if and when
you'll actually had a control the light
bar
so at least for now it's worse than
useless so given the lackluster cooling
performance and the while I suppose the
sort of broken RGB sliding and the
ridiculous price let's not forget the
$800 u.s. price for this very average
RTX 2080 graphics card yeah I'd skip
over this one if it drops down to the
MSRP then it may be worth considering
though the lighting kind of makes it
really annoying so they kind of want to
address that with some sort of software
feature but I feel like yeah it's just
included for the sake of having our GB
it it kind of would have been nicer
without it anyway I think I've said all
