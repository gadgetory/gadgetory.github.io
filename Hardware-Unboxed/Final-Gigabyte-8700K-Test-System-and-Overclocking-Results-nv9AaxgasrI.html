couple of weeks ago you might have seen
my livestream on the channel our first
ever live stream where I built a new
test system with help of Intel gigabyte
and pasted case gear aside from a few
technical issues the stream was a ton of
fun and I hope all those that watch live
to chat with Steve and me had a blast
anyway in that stream I only showed the
completed build briefly and didn't talk
anything about overclocking results or
anything else to do with performance
because I simply didn't have time to get
into that on the stream but in this
video you get to see the finished build
with respectable cable management
unlike the version I showed on the
stream and I'll discuss a little bit
about the overclock I managed so
basically I built the system for testing
various things on Intel's latest
coffee-like
platform I already built an AMD test
system several weeks ago complete with
the rising 720 700 X and a brand new
gigabyte OS X 470 motherboard this
latest build is essentially an Intel
version of that so now I have both an
Intel and AMD build with the latest
parts from both companies expect some
exciting game testing for me when the PC
release season kicks back into gear in a
couple of months the key component in
this build is of course the Intel Core
i7 8700 K until provided us with this
trip directly as a retail sample so
it'll be interesting to see how
overclocks and whether this is a golden
sample considering this is just a simple
sealed retail chip rather than an Intel
QoS chip like they usually give out for
day one reviews I'd add will be anything
special but we'll certainly find out
later the motherboard is gigabyte z 370
horas ultra gaming Wi-Fi with 32 gig of
integrated octane memory gigabyte do
offer a version of this motherboard
without obtain and at the time of the
livestream the octane version was just
15 dollars more than the non obtained
version which I thought was a pretty
good deal especially for those building
a system with that ultra-fast nvme SSDs
right now though the optimal is 50
dollars more than the standard model
through Amazon which is much closer to
the optimal $57 sale price the octane
board is definitely harder to recommend
at that price I'd probably wait until it
gets closer to that $15 price difference
again but those that straight-up don't
want octane can get every other feature
of this board in the non obtain
aside from obtain this board does
provide a ton of RGB like ludicrous
amounts of RGB even for things like the
PCIe sockets and DIMM slots and what
appears to be a four plus three-phase
vrm solution with heat sinks slotting
into this board we have team groups T
force Nighthawk RGB ddr4 memory a 2 x 8
gigabyte kit with ddr4 3000 speeds and
their unique heat spreader design looks
pretty good here although it was a bit
of a challenge to sync up the RGB effect
using gigabytes RGB software it seems to
work some of the time which I guess is
good enough though it's not something
I'll mess around with too much for just
a test system for cooling we have to be
quiet silent loop 280 which should
provide enough thermal capacity for a
respectable overclock of the 8700 K I
installed that in the front with an
embarrassing amount of difficulty so go
back and check the stream for some
awkward issues there entirely my fault
there the cooler is actually quite easy
to install if you're not a dingus like
me anyway everything i've just mentioned
is installed in another be quiet product
the dark bass 700 which are quite liked
with its psu shroud RGB lighting on the
front and tempered glass side panel
there's also plenty of room for cable
management on the rear so there wasn't
too much drama shoving all the cables
into that space and forgetting about it
the case also comes with a fan
controller which is pretty neat the
cases rear fan is a basic affair so I
added some bling to it with fan takes
140 millimeter halos which since the
stream have actually gotten working a
pretty neat concept if you don't want to
pay for RGB fans and just want to use
your existing ones the SSD is also RGB
if you can believe it take a look at the
team group delta r gb SSD which on their
website they call the magnificent
version it's a basic 256 gig sided drive
but the cool feature is its massive RGB
panel on the front there's so much RGB
here I just had to tape it to the inside
of the main compartment of the case but
I can't mention while building the
system the drive doesn't matter too much
in a test system as we already have our
standard test system drives so this silo
model will be fine for now hidden away
under the shroud is a new power supply
from be quiet the straight power 11 650
watt which at the time of the stream
didn't even have a picture on Amazon it
does now though and it's a neat fully
modular unit with an 80 plus gold
certification and of course the GPU
which you will be familiar with if you
saw my AMD test system built its the
gigabyte geforce gtx 1070 TI from that
bills my md test system is currently
loaded up with ave 256 cards so i have
been 1072 i spare and made sense to
chuck in this system for now so you've
probably seen a ton of b-roll of the
build by now and i reckon it looks
pretty awesome for a test system that
RGB SSD in particular just adds to the
craziness inside big thanks to Intel
gigabyte and PC case give helping set
the system up if you're ever interested
in what Intel system I'm using to tester
this is it in terms of overclocking I've
been messing around with the system over
the last few days and it seems this 8700
KS one that reaches 5 gigahertz
reasonably easily but cannot push up to
five point one gigahertz at least on
this board with this sort of cooling
achieved 5 gigahertz just using
gigabytes auto voltage and auto LLC
options with voltages hovering around
the 1.39 to one point for one volt mark
CPU temperatures were just above 90
degrees Celsius and vrm temps they were
a bit toasty in the mid 100's as well
under an IEEE 264 stress test five point
one gigahertz though was problematic
I couldn't achieve it with auto settings
and pushing LLC settings to the max and
shifting voltages up to one point four
two volts just didn't do the trick
possibly running into a heat issue there
with 5.1 gigahertz that Adi later might
solve but that's not something I'll be
doing here in any case I wanted to
achieve 5 gigahertz and I'm happy with
that but this retail chip definitely
isn't a golden sample by any stretch
I might even push the system down to 4.9
gigahertz to ensure top-line stability
and keep temperatures and even better
level I have to keep tinkering with the
system over the next few weeks to see
what it can do anyway that's it for this
recap of my latest Intel test system if
you're interested in the part seen in

that in the description below don't
