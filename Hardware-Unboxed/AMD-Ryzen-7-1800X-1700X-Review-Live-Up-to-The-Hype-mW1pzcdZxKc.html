one people the one where I can finally
show you the rising benchmarks now if
you haven't already skipped ahead just
give me a moment to go over a few things
before we jump to the good stuff as I
mentioned earlier in the week may rise
and testing hasn't exactly gone to plan
and even now I'm not a hundred percent
confident everything's functioning as it
should be I either got a bad board
initially the board that I was using the
Isuzu crosshair it kept breaking SMT
support definitely wasn't boosting
correctly and I had a lot of trouble
with memory compatibility as well in
short I wasted most of the time I had
for testing the first three days I was
just trying to work out bugs and
troubleshoot the board and any results I
did gather during that time I ultimately
thrown out because they were inaccurate
during that time I learned that in order
to extract the most performance out of
rice and the windows power profile needs
to be changed from the default balance
profile to the high performance profile
doing so ensures that the sense mi
appeal power and precision boost
technologies have the ability to respond
to varying workloads as quickly as one
millisecond the balance profile permits
the operating system to request which P
state to use which typically takes up to
30 milliseconds selecting
high-performance completely hands
control over from the operating system
to the processor allowing for better
control I found this led to at least a
5% boost in performance and at time the
gains as much as 15% were seen so it's
important users are aware of this and
make the change of course with a brand
new platform with a radically new CPU
architecture some teething issues are
bound to pop up for the most part it
seems like I was a bit unlucky and wound
up with a motherboard that was a bit of
a lemon for testing I ended up using the
as rock X 370 Taichi the board works
great though it will probably require a
BIOS update or two before it's perfect I
didn't find any memory that would boot
successfully using the XMP profile and
since this is an Intel feature I'm not
even sure why it's here hopefully we'll
see AMD a MP maker come back finally I'm
still not convinced on any other
motherboards I have the rising
processors are boosting correctly so
keep that in mind as a side note for the
Intel CPUs I made sure that any auto
overclocking features such as the
can score option which sees all caused
boosters the maximum turbo frequency
under load were disabled right so I'm
not going to talk about risings
architecture its features or any of that
kind of stuff here I know most of you
simply don't care at this point and just
want to see the benchmark results if you
are interested though check the links
for the written version over at text
comm for testing the Titan XP was used
to handle any rendering work but before
we get to the games I'll quickly look at
some synthetic benchmarks and
application tests okay well we might as
well start here the Cinebench r15
results this is where the fun began for
me so it quickly became somewhat
frustrating
the multi-threaded score of 1624 points
for The Horizon 7 1800 X is incredible
AMD advertised 1601 points so we're well
on track here then
however AMD stress that the single
thread performance has to be hitting at
least 160 points or the CPU isn't
boosting correctly well I tried three
different motherboards while testing and
the best result I got was 154 points on
the asrock X 370 Taichi the ad-rock and
Giga Byte boards went as low as 148
points in this test so going forward I'm
down around 5% and what AMD claims the
single thread performance should be at
for those of you wondering from the most
part my 1,800 X chip was clocked at just
3.7 gigahertz for this test but on
occasion briefly jumped up as high as
four point one gigahertz AMD tells me it
should be pegged at 1.4 gigahertz the
whole time so there's definitely some
sort of issue here temperatures didn't
seem to be the issue as the chip only
around at just over 50 degrees when all
cores are active aimday also tells me
that other reviewers have reached and
even exceeded 160 points that said I
know others who haven't so I'm hoping a
future BIOS update can solve the issue
the 1700 X also looked mighty impressive
and looking at the multi-threaded
performance scoring 1529 points the
single thread score came in at 143
points and that's not bad that places it
just ahead of the core i7 59 60 X and
just behind the 6800 K this is also
similar to the single threaded
performance of the ivory bridge 3770k
for example so to recap amazing multi
thread performance with reasonable
single thread results it will be
interesting to see how much this impacts
real-world testing before we do that oh
let's just check out the memory
bandwidth performance as
an area where the FX series showed a
real weakness unfortunately I was only
able to get my setup stable with ddr4
2666 memory and even that was a bit of a
pain to get working again the XMP
profiles for all the memory I tried have
failed so we had to do things the
old-fashioned way and manually set the
timings which isn't really a big deal I
was briefly able to get the system up
and running with ddr4 3000 memory and
ran a memory test and sawed 32 gigabytes
per second which is on par with scale ik
and KB leak but unfortunately for the
rest of the benchmarks the system just
wasn't stable anyway using ddr4 2666
memory both rise and process has turned
out 29 gigabytes per second which is
reasonable hopefully before too long
memory compatibility and support will
improve on these boards but for now this
is the best I was able to do the last
synthetic benchmark that I had time to
look at was PC marks creative test here
the 1800 X produced a very respectable
eight thousand eight hundred and two
points and while that is lower than the
6700 K and seventy seven are okay
processes it did outpace the 59 60 X and
sixty eight hundred K processors the
1700 X was six percent slower and that
did drop it down alongside the 6800 K
and 6600 K processors still overall
decent results for their eyes and
processes though admittedly it's hard
for me to gauge overall performance from
this test so let's move on the monte
carlo simulation is an old favorite and
this heavy excel workload crushers weak
CPUs the old FX 83-70 for example took
five seconds to complete the workload
and incredibly this means rising is more
than twice as fast here the 1700 X beat
the 59 60 X by reasonable margin taking
just two point two seven seconds granted
300 milliseconds isn't a lot but it does
mean at the AMD processor was 13% faster
the 1800 X of course was faster again
taking just two point one three seconds
the fastest desktop processor which is
also by far the most expensive the core
i7 69 50 X is that were to completely
test in just 1.7 seconds
still the 1800 X is mighty impressive
the 7-zip dictionary test sees the 1800
X and 59 60 X go head-to-head and the
result a dead heat meanwhile the 1700 X
had no trouble out muscling the six core
12 threads 6000 okay in this test so
another great showing for AMD's new 8
core
Rison processes those of you who spend a
good deal of timing encoding videos in
programs such as Premiere Pro like me
will love what Rison has to offer
granted premier is still generally best
handled by something like the semi semi
okay overclocked to the max but here we
see the 1800 ex delivering a truly
impressive result completing the
workload in five hundred 85 seconds made
at a whisker fast in the 59 60 X and 9
percent faster than the 7700 K but 1,700
X was also impressive taking just 618
seconds these really are truly
impressive results unfortunately though
due to the technical difficulties that
hindered my benchmarking progress these
are all the application tests I was able
to conduct in time for today's release
next up I have four games to check out
having seen such impressive productivity
performance I had high hopes for Eisen
when it came to gaming and while the
results are interesting please note that
the gaming graphs are arranged by the
minimum frame rate and the Titan XP was
used for testing at 1080p to reduce the
GPU bottleneck so with slower GPUs or
more demanding quality settings the
results will even up and the CPUs lag
behind in these tests will of course
look more competitive anyway as expected
Rosen does indeed trail the skylake and
cable 8 processors when it comes to
gaming performance though the margin is
an extremely significant at least in
battlefield 1 the 1800 X looks great for
the minimum frame rate though you can't
help but notice the lower than expected
average frame rate looking at the
average frame rate the 1800 X is on par
with the Ivy Bridge 3770k not a bad
result by any means and its world's
better than the old FX 83-70 still we
are seeing that when rise and 7 isn't
fully utilized it's slightly weaker IPC
performance can be seen meanwhile the
1700 X matches the minimum frame rate of
the 59 60 X though the average frame
rate was only similar to the Sandy
Bridge 2600 K coming from the reasonably
good battle 2:1 performance I was pretty
disappointed with the results seen when
testing with Gears of War 4 here the
1800 X struggled to keep pace with the
Ivy Bridge 3770k while the 1700 X was
again similar to the 2600 ok not a
terrible result and the minimum frame
rate was still decent still this is an
early indication that game is rocking
high refresh rate monitors will probably
want to stick with a core i7 processor
the overwatch bot test is very demanding
and in the past we've seen chloride
five processes struggle to keep up with
the hyper-threading enabled core i7s so
where does Rison fit in well right in
the middle when looking at the minimum
frame rate again the average frame rates
aren't that impressive as the Rison
process is obviously unallowable same
height
still the performance was a massive step
up from the FX 83-70 and the minimums
were a good bit higher than those Sandy
Bridge and Ivy Bridge core i7 processors
the last game that I had timer test was
watchdogs - and this was an important
title to include I felt here CPU
utilization hovered between 70 and 80
percent on the horizon processes what's
more is the loading was even across all
16 threads yet despite that it didn't
put away the eight threaded core i7
processors like these 59 60 X did in
fact they were a good bit slower here at
least when compared to the 6800 K 6700 K
and 7700 K they did manage to outperform
that as well and Ivy Bridge core i7 and
of course all the core i5 processors so
again not a bad result here but I
honestly did expect to see better
results in a game that can load up to 16
threads quite heavily right so time to
overclock I squeezed all this in the
last minute and having spoken with a few
other reviewers I feel like I've been
able to get the most out of these
processors AMD suggests that 4.2
gigahertz with the 1800 X should be
possible at an incredible 1.45 volts
that said though they don't recommend
this voltage for daily use as it will
reduce the lifespan of the processor
they suggest 1.3 5 volts for daily
driving but didn't mention the clock
speed you should be able to achieve at
that voltage anyway my 1,800 X wasn't
stable at 4.2 gigahertz using one point
4 or 5 volts instead 4 point 1 gigahertz
was the limit and I could leave the
voltage on auto here the motherboard
appeared to be boosting the voltage to
around 1 point 3 5 volts when under load
the 1700 X unfortunately didn't make the
1.4 gigahertz at the 1800 X did and was
instead limited to three point nine five
megahertz speaking with Brian over at
tech city for the past few days he also
found three point nine five gigahertz to
be the limit for his 1700 X chip and he
spent quite a bit more time than I did
trying to push it further so I'm
confident this is the end of the road at
least one air-cooled most of the
overclocking was done at the BIOS level
however AMD does have a very cool
utility on offer called AMD rise and
master this windows-based overclocking
software
tool works extremely well and it's easy
for novice users to play around with
adjust in the clock multiplier for all
the cause or individual cause can be
done quickly on the fly while changing
memory settings or disabling calls will
require a reset the overclock push the
1800 X to a multi-threaded score of 1701
point which is an impressive score
though this is only a mild 5 percent
performance bump which is less than what
I should have received given the clock
speeds a score of more like 1800 points
would have been in line with what I was
expecting
finally the 1700 X enjoyed a 10%
performance boost with a score of 1687
points here we see that the 7-zip
performance of the 1800 X has been
increased by 6%
while the 1700 X found additional 9%
performance that puts the overclock 1700
X ahead of the stock 1800 X and as you
might have expected well ahead of the
4.9 gigahertz 7700 K all you Excel buffs
watching a going to love an overclocked
horizon 7 CPU prepare to organize and
manipulate data at a rate previously
unimaginable for $500 or less overclock
the 700 X matches the 59 60 X while the
1800 X almost completes the workload in
two seconds flat overclock the 1700 X
boosts the minimum frame rate by 6% to
match the performance of the stock 1800
X meanwhile overclocking the 1800 X only
increase the minimum frame rate by 4%
still when looking at the minimum frame
rates the 1800 X is still very
impressive it's just a shame I couldn't
extend the average a little further out
of the box for 17-under X consumes a
similar amount of power to that of the
59 60 X while the 1800 X is quite a bit
hungrier overlooked lock the total
system consumption for the 700 X was 220
watts and that was almost a 30% increase
for what was up to a 10 percent boost in
performance
meanwhile the overclocked 1800 X pushed
total system power consumption up by
almost 20% to 284 watts for some reason
the Rison process has consumed a maximum
power in the Excel test whereas the
intel processes don't therefore
comparing the power consumption using
prime95 gives more balanced results and
makes a 1700 and 1800 axle considerably
more efficient here we see that out of
the box the 1800 X consumes slightly
less power than 1600 K while the 1700 X
was similar to that of the 6800 K on
older 4790k
using the supplied nacho a Nhu 1/2 e se
Am for cooler I saw very respectable
temperatures on the horizon 7 1800 X
processor the chip idles just 35 degrees
and the full load using a burnin test
that peaked at just 53 degrees at first
I thought the motherboard or software
might have been reporting incorrectly
but after 40 minutes of load the
heatsink was barely warm to touch
testing was conducted with an ambient
room temperature of 21 degrees right so
the results are in though admittedly
compared to the testing I normally like
to do I feel like this is a bit of a
preview really so I didn't include
nearly as many games and applications as
I would have liked for a release day
video I will be following this video up
shortly with a more in-depth test
covering something like a dozen games or
probably more than doping games at 1080p
and 1440p that's that I am very keen to
check out other day 1 reviews to see the
kind of results they got I'm pretty sure
my application results are on where they
should be but for the gaming that isn't
using all the calls or all the threads I
think there may be a bit of a boost
issue that's holding me back a little
bit and if that is the case I will work
quickly to solve that issue I'm already
working on it with AMD now because they
think there's more to be had so you'll
be interesting to find out I've done
everything I can at this point having
said all that though I do feel like
they're testing and included still
paints a very interesting picture when
it comes to productivity and content
creation the horizon 7 CPUs are
extremely impressive the Premiere Pro
and Excel performance was incredible and
it really got me hyped up for the gaming
performance unfortunately while
certainly not bad the gaming performance
was somewhat of a letdown we always knew
this was one area where rosin might
struggle against the Empire so results
while a little disappointing aren't
entirely surprising for the most part
Andy had only shown off risings gaming
capabilities at the 4k resolution using
a Pascal Titan X and we all know this
isn't how you test CPU gaming
performance this merely imposes a GPU
bottleneck that virtually eliminates any
impact the CPU might have on performance
within reason anyway one thing I did
notice is that all the games I have
looked at so far which is considerably
more than the four shown in this video
we're all incredibly smooth on the rise
and process
GTA 5 for example plays very well on the
core i7 7700 K but every now and then a
slight stutter can be noticed the 1800 X
in comparison was as smooth as silk and
not once they spot any kind of
stuttering
I found a similar situation when testing
battlefield one as well
performance was incredibly smooth with
the horizon processes while every now
and then the quad-core 7700 K had a
small hiccup though admittedly you know
this didn't happen often but it's still
every now and then you noticed a quick
little stutter and this was something
that I never ever saw when playing for
quite some time on the 1800 x and 1700 X
still as smooth as the experience was
using a risin 7 process of in gaming I
feel that those running high refresh
rate monitors are probably still going
to be best served by something like a
high clocked core i7 6700 K or 7700 K I
imagine many of you were looking at the
gaming performance shown here and a bit
disappointed with the results they might
not be as strong as we had hoped but
they are highly competitive and it
should see the risin 5 and 3 series
delivered extremely competitive gaming
performance also worth noting is that we
are testing extreme gaming performance
here with the Titan XP at 1080p
Rison does look more competitive at
1440p and will certainly appear far more
competitive with something like a gtx
1070 or fury x handling the rendering
work so keep that in mind also worth
keeping in mind is that although the
extra cores are particularly useful in
today's games they could be very useful
in the future how far into future though
I don't really know my crystal ball is
currently down for maintenance
the only other letdown was the
overclocking but again like the gaming
performance this was something we
weren't expecting rising to deliver I
was only able to hit 4.1 gigahertz with
my 8100 X and even that took quite a bit
of trial and error
sadly the 1700 X couldn't even reach 4
gigahertz still the gains for the 1700 X
were decent and at 20% more affordable
this is the processor I would buy that's
what I have no idea how well does
Vanilla 1700 overclocks
but I will be getting one next week I am
aware that some reviewers got them for
today's release so chances are you can
already find out how while these chips
clock power consumption was a bit higher
than expected our Excel figures are
similar to those when using a power bug
program like prime95 for example when
gaming Rison should be
efficient and I'll look into this in
another video shortly at the end of the
day when you consider what AMD was
coming from and look what they have
achieved with Verizon it's nothing short
of amazing I'm personally very excited
to see AMD delivering a competitive
high-end CPU and it shall be very
interesting to see how well they can
refine the zen architecture over the
coming years we know that Intel is hit
somewhat of a development wall if you
will so this may afford AMD the chance
to catch up even further of course the
good news consumers and all this being
that with the added competition Intel is
already starters adjust their pricing
across the board and I expect to see
more of this as AMD turns up the heat
further with their six school and four
core rise and CPUs for now I do have a
heat more testing to do and I'll be
aiming to deliver those results in a
video early next week assuming there's
nothing seriously wrong with my test
setup I now have a few new biases for
the boards that I have in hand so I'm
going to apply those straight up try at
this video and start checking out if
that helps with the Cinebench single
thread score really hoping it does
hopefully after a bit more testing I can
give you guys my picks and more of a
concrete opinion on Rison with that I'm
going to get back to the benchmark grind
I'm your host Steve and hopefully I'll
catch you next week for more Verizon
action and I might even check out the
gtx 1080i while i'm at it
see you guys
you
