through the comments section of my rx
480 in GTX 1060 reviews you'll quickly
learn that it's a special directx12
feature that cripples in video hardware
and shows just how awesome anybody's GCN
architecture really is yes sometimes the
YouTube comments section can be very
educational the truth is we still don't
really know how AMD is Polaris and
invidious paschal architectures stack up
in DirectX 12 titles and what the
implications of eights in computer will
be and we won't know until we have at
least a dozen good quality titles to
test that said we're beginning to get a
glimpse of what the future might hold
the first really well put together
DirectX 12 title was ashes of the
singularity this realtime strategy game
created a heap of discussion and plenty
of speculation regarding how AMD and
video will stack up in a world filled
with quality DirectX 12 titles the
controversy began when it was discovered
that in videos Maxwell and Pasco GPUs
weren't actually faster using DirectX 12
rather they were slightly slower in
relation to the DirectX 11 performance
on the other hand aimed is GCM base
Radeon graphics cards enjoyed up to 30%
more performance when using DirectX 12
over DirectX 11 so why is this well many
would have you believe it has everything
to do with asynchronous compute it's no
secret that AMD's GCN has asynchronous
compute engines or ACS built into the
architecture for hardware based async
compute support whereas in video on the
other hand doesn't feature dedicated
hardware support for acing computer so
then case closed Nvidia messed up
despite knowing full well that AMD had
implemented support over four years ago
but how can that be billions spent on
R&amp;amp;D only to make a crucial mistake
that'll cripple them going forward well
hang on a minute
let's just take a look at what's really
going on here why in a game such as
ashes of the singularity doesn't video
see no real benefit and why does AMD
come from such poor DirectX 11
performance to such strong directors 12
performance and video would have you
believe it's down to the fact that their
more recent GPU architectures are
already extremely efficient therefore
they don't benefit from low-level api s
and the features they offer such as
async compute that seems like a pretty
convenient answer but Nvidia might have
a point
I feel we are seeing the full potential
of their Maxwell and Pascal cards and
directives 11 titles they are after all
extremely efficient when compared to
their ng counterparts testing with
DirectX 11 title sees the are X 480
consume the same amount of power as the
gtx 1070 which isn't great giving it on
average 30% slower by now I think we can
all agree the problem for AMD has been
efficiency and these problems seem to
stem not just from the architecture but
also the software aka display driver if
we first look at the architecture and
how it scales then adding more stream
processors you find some interesting and
perhaps unexpected results the Radeon r9
390 for example features 2560 SPU's or
rather let's say cause the I know nano
boasts 60% more cause at 4096 they're
operating at the same 1,000 megahertz
frequency the Nano cause also had 33%
more bandwidth to play with so you'd
expect the Nano to be around 60% faster
however in reality the Nano is on
average just a little over 20% faster
than the r9 390 in DirectX 11 titles if
we look at my Star Wars Battlefront
results from the GTX 1060 video for
example we see the Nano is just 15%
faster than the 390 so in this title a
60% increase in caused netted 15% more
performance keep in mind there are no
system limitations capping the
performance of the nano either if we
look at the gtx 1060 and compared to the
1070 which features 50% more cores we
see the 1070 is 32% faster so you won't
get perfect scaling from nvidia either
but the performance gain is much closer
to the increase in cause this is a real
problem for AMD because as they ramped
up the core count in order to compete
with in videos upper echelon this
inefficiency continues to amplify for
whatever reason the GCN architecture
isn't able to fully utilize all these
cores and as a result we see much
smaller performance gains than what the
specs would suggest this also doesn't
help with power efficiency as those
cores are still present and active even
if they aren't being fully utilized
getting back to ashes of the singularity
here we have a game with AMD and NVIDIA
architecture actually scaled quite
evenly using DirectX 11 this isn't the
best GPU test given it's a real-time
strategy game and therefore
predominantly CPU bound despite that we
see when testing with DirectX 11 that rx
40 and I know
ix are only able to match the GTX 970
meanwhile the GTX 1060 can be seen
beating the Nano
moving to DirectX 12 we find a rather
different story the GTX 1060 is still
faster than the our X 480 but only just
well the 480 does be both 980 and 970
the Nano however is now considerably
faster than the 1060 and even beats the
980 TI the odd thing here is that we go
from one extreme to the other running on
the DirectX 11 API the AMD cards are
much slower than they typically are in
other titles then when we tested with
DirectX 12 they're much faster than you
would expect the fury X for example
beats the GTX 1070 basically AMD has
made no effort to optimize the drivers
for DirectX 11 performance and ashes
well the game itself has been heavily
optimized for aim DS GC and architecture
so the results from this one game make
it difficult to draw any real
conclusions so I'm going to choose not
to draw one moving on we find doom with
its recent updated supporting the Vulcan
API prior to the update the radeon gpus
struggled using OpenGL here we see the
RX 4 ad was good for 89 FPS on average
of 1080p while the GTX 1060 pumped at
112 FPS this meant using OpenGL dr x 480
was 21% slower now with Vulcan and async
compute shaders enabled thanks to the
use of TSS AAA we see the GTX 1060
maintains that same 112 FPS average the
R X 480 on the other hand gains an
incredible 36 percent performance boost
making it now 8 percent faster than the
1060 what's also interesting to note
here is the I 9 390 was slower when
compared to the rx 480 using OpenGL this
is interesting as the r9 390 features
11% more cause enabling Vulcan allows
the more core heavy 390 to just
outperform the 480 is the low-level API
helps overcome any efficiency problems
this effect is amplified to a much
greater degree when looking at the core
rich nano
which sees a massive 53 percent
performance boost for now acing computer
is only enabled when using Vulcan in
doom if anti-aliasing is disabled or
tssaa a is used so what happens if we
disable AC and compute by using
invidious taa method well not a lot
based on what we see here in fact the RX
for ad delivered the same 121 FPS from a
three run average using TA and
yes si a given by using different
anti-aliasing methods this example isn't
an apples to apples comparison but it
does strongly suggest the async computer
isn't really responsible for aim these
stellar performance in Doom and using
Vulcan okay so what about 3d marks new
DirectX 12 times fire synthetic
benchmark that allows us to enable and
disable async compute in to GPU tests
looking at the first graphics test we
find some interesting results
the gcf's 1060 is indeed faster with
acing compute enabled albeit by just 4%
the rx 480 however was 14% faster with
async computer enabled though I should
point out in this test it was still 11%
slower than the GTX 1060 still there's
no denying that
AMD's hardware support for async compute
does give them a performance advantage
in this test the second time spot
graphics test shows different
performance trends here the GTX 1060 was
no faster or slower with async compute
disabled the RX 4 ad on the other hand
was temps and faster with async compute
enabled though this wasn't me a 3 FPS
game so it seems that in certain cases
async compute can enable around 10
percent more performance on the AMD GPUs
that being the case how GPUs such as the
Nano over 50% faster in Doom when using
a low-level api in that example we saw
racing compute was only improving
performance by a few percent it's my
opinion that the Radeon GPUs are so much
faster when running on a low-level API
such as DirectX 12 of volcán simply
because that's how fast they should be
the way in which DirectX 11 works simply
doesn't suit the way AMD designed their
drivers the issue here is a key feature
of DirectX 11 command lists this is a
DirectX 11 feature that AMD doesn't
support and this is what hurts the
DirectX 11 performance command lists
essentially takes single-threaded code
and try to multi thread it sounds
familiar hey I'm of course referring to
async compute actually it's probably
more like hyper threading for your GPU
these command lists were touted as a
massive step forward for DirectX 11
terms of multi-threaded performance when
it was first announced so while Andy
offers hardware basic compute for api's
that support it it didn't bother to take
advantage of a similar feature for
DirectX 11 a driver level by failing to
take advantage of this multi thread
feature amy has run into a driver
overhead problem that hampers CPU
performance in a way Andy's been lucky
to a degree firstly almost every review
test with the most high-end hardware
possible in an effort to eliminate or at
least reduce system bottlenecks that
could limit GPU performance and
therefore shape the results I myself do
this by writing a core i7 six to seven
hundred K at four point five gigahertz
and for AMD this helps reduce the impact
of the driver overhead also for the most
part modern games a GPU dependent which
also helps to limit the impact of the
driver overhead
likewise when testing higher-end GPUs we
benchmark at high resolutions such as
1440p and 4k the GPU becomes the primary
bottleneck here so any extra load on the
CPU goes largely unnoticed
the driver overhead does however present
a real problem for those running lower
end or older hardware it's been seen in
the past when testing budget GPUs that
AMD is faster than using a high-end rig
but falls behind when using a budget
system in short AMD has two things
working against them when using API such
as OpenGL and DirectX 11 firstly and
most crucially I believe is the driver
overhead which is a particularly big
problem for both low end and high end
AMD GPUs then you have the core
efficiency issue which async computers
believe to help solve though this could
also just be the benefit of using a
low-level api as that stops the cpu from
holding the GPU up so it's my belief
that we're really now starting to see
the true performance of AMD GPUs in
games using low-level api's as for
NVIDIA is there more performance to be
had should they have integrated async
compute engines into their design
honestly I have no idea but it stands to
reason that doing so probably would net
them up to 10% more performance in games
such as ashes of the singularity keep in
mind adding this technology could also
increase the power consumption by that
margin so then you have to wonder how
worthwhile with such a change be for an
already very efficient architecture in
the end this is ultimately good news for
everyone if the next generation of games
do enable AMD to up their game then we
should start to see more affordable
graphics cards as a result perhaps
that's just wishful thinking but I'd
