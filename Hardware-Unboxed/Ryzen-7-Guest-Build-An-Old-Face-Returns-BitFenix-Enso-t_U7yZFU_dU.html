today's video we're exploring part three
of why it's a bad time to build a PC
don't make at the moment Oh Mac hey hey
you're not bad what's going on well my
computer's died and I need help
alright give me a very guys alright way
back I've looked at Matt's computer and
tried to work out what's going on with
it
fortunately it looks like he's
motherboard has died so reasonably easy
component to replace there but we've
decided to build a new computer anyway
because you're doing some more work now
and do lots of video editing so bit more
granted be nice yeah what have you got
at the moment it's a 46 70k yes I fourth
gen has well Core i5 so only 4 cores 4
threads so we thought you know more more
grunt is definitely near there and for
encoding and work and light sort of
stuff so as you guys know it's pretty
bad time to be building a new computer
and all that very expensive time notice
we could pick up z97 motherboard
something like for not too much though
they are quite expensive what they are
it kind of always makes sense you can
get be 350 motherboards cheaper and with
the rise in 7 1700 being recently
discounted it's probably a good time to
pick up seems like a good excuse yeah
good excuse maybe not a good time for
the good yeah so that's what we're gonna
do we're gonna build Matt a new computer
today we're gonna ditch the old one
we'll bring over it motion to view
storage and all that sort of stuff and
yeah things that we can possibly the
graphics card you play a few games day
ya know casual gamer hassle gamer so
we've got to work out what we're going
to do about the graphics card whether we
stick with the one you've got which may
be a way to go or if there's we might do
some benchmarks with a few different
options and see what you could do so
we're gonna go over all the parts that
I've worked out that Matt can have for
his new build with the heads and spears
yeah there's a couple couple of spare
parts so we'll work out that and in
we're gonna probably do this in two
parts so the first part we're going to
work out the parts will actually test
them outside of the computer case to get
like a
best case scenario if your will for
temperatures and then I have an
interesting case that you'll see in a
moment that we're going to be putting
all the parts into so let's get to that
all right so I've got the case yeah it's
quite pretty so sure some of you guys
are familiar with this case we'll talk
about why we've picked it in a moment
and what we want to test and work out
the way we'll get to that in a second
all right look at the motherboard power
supply you'll need that many fans and
our GPS ok we've also got the new
crucial mx-5 hundred one terabyte SSD so
we're gonna give that a whirl in the
build we're gonna go to the horizon 7
1700 and we'll definitely be
overclocking that they'll be interested
in what temperatures and things alike
and as you said we've got some RGB
lights of course we've got the nine to
forty millimeter all in one liquid
cooler we have the BitFenix Formula gold
rated is 750 watt power supply subtle
power everything nicely then with the
motherboard a little bit overkill here
with the gaming seven and that's a X 370
motherboard so not necessary and it's
probably not even a wise investment
because we know about the X 470 boards
coming out in a few months time with the
second-generation Rison CPUs so if you
were building right now and you couldn't
wait you had to build kind of like the
situation Matt finds himself in because
he's got to get work done he needs to
get it done quickly hence the upgrade so
ABI 350 motherboard would be the way to
go there anyway this is all I have spare
so that's getting a nice upgrade there
you
as if you haven't lost your edge okay so
we've got the core components ready
we've got our isin 7 1700 out to install
at the moment I'll probably make Matt do
all that you remember how to build a
computer find out we'll find out
so that's going to happen we've got the
memory the power supply lat stuff we're
gonna grab a monitor I'll grab a test
system SSD get it all installed do about
an hour's worth of stress testing and
record the temperatures we've got an
ambient room temperature of 21 degrees
so we'll compare that to the final
temperatures in the case once built in
the BitFenix
ends okay so that should be interesting
let's get a building or at least roughly
setting up now I'll let you you can slot
the CPU in I'll get some thermal paste
come on you can do it actually I might
even have the monitor set to the right
input I might even have the one who
turned on
protip guys turn the monitor on did it
we did it I had my doubts but we did it
takes so if you want to take that home
we're done now all right so we put
together our test bed we've got it all
set up it is actually working oh there
you go look at that working so you did
it where yeah we did it yay for us so
we're all set up we're about to run some
stress tests at the moment there's been
no overclocking done we've just loaded
the optimized bios of vast defaults
basically so we run some temperature
tests there and we'll be able to compare
the results we get on the test bed here
to when it's in at the case so that's
the most important things we can measure
the difference the casemates there and
yes are we gonna do that first with the
default settings then we'll overclock it
and we'll come back and let you guys
know what temperature's we found let's
talk about the stock results for the
horizon 7 1700 the gigabyte a X 370
gaming k7 motherboard again the ambient
air temperature was 21 degrees and a 264
CPU and FPU stress test was used for all
the load testing under full load for an
hour the CPU temperature picked it just
44 degrees which is really a great
result for an 8 core CPU perhaps more
impressive though was the fact the pump
in the all-in-one liquid cool operated
at just 1700 rpm and was virtually
silent while the two 120 millimeter fans
were basically silent spinning at just
800 rpm the vrm temp that was reasonably
good as well reaching just 60 degrees
after the hour-long stress test so
that'll looks really good time to
overclock the Rison 7 1700 is now been
overclocked to 4 gigahertz using 1.37 5
volts as soon as the overclock
configuration was placed under load we
exceed the previous maximum temperature
of 44 degrees and quickly climbed above
60 degrees
before long the system maxed out at 76
degrees though hardware info did report
a spike to 85 degrees Matt 9 monitored
the last 20
minutes of stress testing and it held at
76 degrees for the entire time so
looking back at the log file we see that
the spire 25 degrees only happened for
like a second so perhaps that was just a
glitch
the real concern here for Matt though
are those vrm temperatures shockingly
the Gigabyte ax 370 gaming K 7 hit 112
degrees
unfortunately I decided to touch the vrm
heatsink before just looking at the
monitor and checking what hardware info
was reporting it was a pretty clever
choice that as a result I actually burnt
my finger slightly and while I was
jumping around complaining Matt just
laughed at me so we got the IR gun and
we aim that at the verum heatsink and
that report at a temperature of 98
degrees for the aluminum heatsink so
it's fair to say 112 degrees reported by
hardware info is accurate although we
are using an all-in-one liquid core the
120 millimeter fans were actually
directing quite a bit of air flow over
the vrm heat sinks given how we'd had
situated on the desk and it wasn't
really hot air either it was certainly
warm air but not hot so this is going to
be something we'll need to try and
address when putting the motherboard in
the BitFenix case anyway that's going to
do it for part 1 of building fixing
upgrading Matt's computer parts we will
of course put it in their case dual or
temperature of tests and show you guys
the build process that should be pretty
cool can you be getting a new computer
yeah let's do part 2 alright that's
ready to go I'm your host Steve let me
host Matt as always
go gonna like genuinely act very upset
with usually more based applications</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
