beginning to take a deeper look into
some of the new features that shipped
with AMD's latest novel GPUs the Radeon
rx 5700 and what we have here the rx
5700 XT of course we already have full
reviews of these GPUs up on the channel
if you have missed them go check them
out but to save on time we didn't end up
talking about any of the additional
features and it was providing one of
those features is Radeon image
sharpening and they'll be the focus of
this video we also have ready on anti
lag and that'll be my next investigation
both are very interesting technologies
they won't marketed as must-haves or key
selling points for these new GPUs but
just a nice bonus for buyers and I
believe anti-lag actually supports all
the GPUs anyway so what is Radeon image
sharpening well in very basic terms it's
a post-processing feature you can enable
that makes games sharper you turn it on
the sharpness is improved everyone walks
away happy that the image quality is now
better this can have a wide range of
benefits but to me there are two key use
cases the first is for games that are a
bit soft to begin with lots of tiles
these days are using temporal
anti-aliasing or taa and often that can
lead to a blurry presentation radiant
image sharpening is where to sharpen
those games up a bit and still give a
crisp image the other use cases for
resolution down sampling say you have a
4k display but want a bit more
performance so you can run games at
1,800 PE or 80% resolution scale or
something like that this of course makes
the image a bit soft as it's not being
rendered at a native resolution radiant
image sharpening could proce process
that image add a bit of sharpness back
and get close to the native image for
virtually no performance loss in a sense
it's basically like what Nvidia is
attempting with DSS and will compare the
two a bit later on radio and image
sharpening isn't just a basic sharpening
filter instead uses as a contrast
adaptive sharpening or casas algorithm
that aim be recently introduced in their
fidelity FX suite while game developers
can take fidelity FX and implement that
in their games as they see fit
Radeon image sharpening is a broad
effect that doesn't require per game
implementation it's a simple switch in
Radeon settings to dive deeper into what
cares does of
quite directly from a md's material on
it they say because Radeon image
sharpening is based on an algorithm that
modulates the degree of sharpening
depending on contrast it clarifies
interior object details while leaving
high contrast edges largely untouched
they go on to say that this prevents a
number of artifacts you often get with
more traditional sharpening there is a
pretty big catch though
while radiant image sharpening doesn't
require per game implementation or any
developer intervention it is only
supported as of right now in DirectX 12
Vulcan and DirectX and nine games
crucially this means DirectX 11 titles
are not supported if you enable radiant
image sharpening in those games and
simply won't do anything
AMD told me they decided to focus on
newer api's to begin with
while DirectX 9 was included because
that was very easy for them only
recognizes that DX 11 is the next step
for support and they'll consider adding
that in a future software update if
there's demand from the community for
that feature hopefully they do because
even today there are lots of games that
either only support DX 11 or perform
better on DX 11 while still supporting
DX 12 enabling Radeon image sharpening
is straightforward all you have to do is
install the latest drivers head over to
the display section and enable both GPU
scaling and Radeon image sharpening the
feature is only available for Navi GPU
so right now that's the 50 750 700 XT
there is no support for Vega or older as
made an image sharpening relies on some
of the new hardware features in Navi to
deliver cars with next to no performance
loss what I will say though is right now
there is no way to enable image
sharpening only in specific games it's
either on for everything or off you
cannot set image sharpening to be
enabled only in certain games in the
game profile section of Radeon settings
there's something aimed he should look
into because gamers might not want the
feature enabled in every game they play
for whatever reason anyway enough
waffling let's show some quality
comparisons and the game I'm going to
spend the most time looking at is Metro
Exodus
it has DSS support for NVIDIA cards it
runs well in DirectX 12 mode and has a
lot of high detail environments I
strongly recommend watching this video
at youtube's 4k quality or by grabbing a
higher bitrate version from our patreon
page if you are a member I'm going to
start here by simply comparing the
difference between image sharpening
off at a native 4k resolution Metro
isn't the sharpest game going around at
native resolutions it's a tad bit soft
and there are no anti-aliasing options
in the game but there's certainly still
a lot of detail in the native 4k
presentation the sharpened image is
noticeably sharper as you'd expect and
cleans up that little bit of softness in
the native image it's particularly
effective on foliage really cleans up
the grass and trees in this run which
are the softest elements of the native
image on clothes textures it has a minor
effect and slightly improves what it's
already a crisp texture the cows
algorithm also seems to do a good job of
ignoring things that you wouldn't want
sharpened like motion blur or depth of
field effects and while it's not perfect
at ignoring those elements in motion
it's hard to spot any issues with that
said there are some flaws here that
shouldn't be ignored
overall the sharpened image is brighter
in this scene if i zoom in on the thin
foliage it's obviously quite a lot
brighter when sharpened same goes for
the train tracks and some other areas of
the image it's probably not something
you'd notice if it weren't for this
side-by-side but it does seem to be an
artifact of the filter
there are also some elements that the
causality doesn't know to ignore it
doesn't truly know which elements should
be sharpened which shouldn't for example
when near the water here metro exorcist
does have some screen space reflection
artifacts they are more noticeable with
Radeon image sharpening enabled as the
artifacts are getting sharpened to be
more visible a my issue but it's
something I spotted overall though I
think that for improving a native image
radiant image sharpening does a really
good job here and generally looks better
than the native presentation even if it
is a bit faked when you stop and examine
the falls at times I felt it was perhaps
too sharp
maybe unrealistically sharp but during
actual gameplay and motion I think this
isn't as much of an issue in most
circumstances don't look at some results
when down sampling I'll start here with
1440p versus 4k right away the 1440p
native image is a lot softer than the 4k
native image and looks blurry when up
scale to 4k not an ideal way to play on
a high resolution display the sharpened
1440p image is a big improvement over
native 1440p
but ultimately just doesn't have the
same level of detail as the native 4k
image closed textures get pretty close
but with some of the fine foliage detail
and other small elements
there just aren't enough pixels and
native detail in the 1440p image to
simulate a 4k presentation through a
post process filter however the story is
very different when talking about down
sampling in the 1800 P range in Metro
Exodus I set a zero point seven times
shader scale which is roughly equivalent
to 1800 P and without sharpening the
1,800 P image is obviously soft to the
native 4k it's not as bad as 1440p but
you're still getting a loss of clarity
and fine detail compared to running at a
native resolution but turn on sharpening
for the 1800 P image and yeah wow I was
seriously impressed with the results
here it's not a perfect recreation of 4k
and still suffers from some of the
general issues with post process
sharpening but in many scenes it's
incredibly close and virtually
indistinguishable from the native image
true 4k has slightly more fine detail
and foliage and other elements but you'd
be hard-pressed to spot the difference
especially without a side-by-side
comparison before moving on to look at
performance here let's there up some DLS
s footage captured using an RT X 2070 a
4k with DL SS enabled the image is being
up scaled from 1440p through invidious
deep learning algorithms DL SS in Metro
is the best implementation I've seen and
it's much better than using radio and
human sharpening on a 1440p image but
it's just not as good as aimed these
sharpened 1800 P in the best cases DL SS
is as good to sharpen 1800 P for large
elements and close textures but dealin
says still suffers from the oil painting
effect I mentioned in my initial
investigation which looks bad in some
environments and it suffers from quite a
bit of fine detail loss especially for
rocks and some foliage the way it
thickens really fine details like tree
branches or wires also degrades the DSS
image in my opinion overall sharpened
1800 P gets a lot closer to native 4k
than DLS s at least in Metro exodus of
course we also have performance data for
you across the three conditions I tested
within Metro performance dropped by
between one and two percent with radiant
image sharpening enabled versus disabled
that's a negligible difference in was at
most a 1 FPS reduction which is well
worth it for the quality improvements in
most situations this means that for
those targeting sharpened 1800 P as a
higher performance replacement for 4k
you're looking at around at 27% uplift
average frame rates in this title for
almost no quality loss those are the
sort of numbers I like to see
I'll also throw in DL s s numbers here
obviously from a different GPU so it
doesn't match up exactly to the rx 5700
XT results but in the latest version of
Metro Exodus for KD LSS still performs
around the same mark as the 1800 P image
so this once again reinforces my opinion
that a simple sharpening filter can be
as good as or in this case noticeably
better than jail SS for a similar
performance uplift I remember saying
this at the time of my DSS
investigations and despite there being
hope that Nvidia would train DSS to
improve over time that hasn't really
eventuated let's move on to battlefield
5 and again a lot of similar
observations with this game sharpening a
native image does look better
battlefield 5 is sharper in general than
Metro Exodus but still a bit soft from
temporal anti-aliasing much to my
surprise despite keeping film grain
enabled for this testing the sharpening
filter didn't really make the grain more
noticeable which can often be a side
effect of sharpening with grain present
for resolution down sampling I focused
on a 78% resolution scale which is
around 1700 P because this matches the
performance uplift of DL SS in this
title battlefield 5 handles upscaling
really well and actually looks only
slightly worse at a 78% scale versus
native 4k in this scene it's a bit
softer a bit less details but overall
it's not bad this makes it a perfect
candidate for sharpening and indeed
using radiant image sharpening the image
is in fact sharper than native 4k
despite coming from a lower resolution
base so that's pretty impressive
thorough DSS into the mix and it looks
significantly worse than the sharpened
1700 P image battlefield 5 still has a
weak TLS s implementation and really
can't hold up to this super basic
sharpening filter in fact even the
native 1700 be image is better in my
opinion so this tile shows the weakness
of DL SS sharpening isn't quite as
effective with this foliage dense scene
from battlefield 5 but it still does a
decent job of getting close enough to
the native 4k image that you take the
small visual quality loss for the
upwards of 30% performance uplift if
you're wondering about more performance
numbers ready an image sharpening across
all the games I tested resulted in a 1
to 2 percent performance drop so I'm not
going to show you charts for every game
here's a game that doesn't support DSS
at all but can be
used with radiant image sharpening the
division - this game plays really nicely
with resolution down sampling its
post-processing is phenomenal and you
can often run the game at a 75%
resolution scale with very little loss
to quality at 4k so there's no surprise
the game is a good candidate for radiant
image sharpening and a 75% scale with
sharpening the image was often crisper
than native 4k although there were some
times where jagged edges were more
present in the downsampled image or for
distant foliage you get a few branches
with the native 4k image that you don't
get with a 75% scale still given
sharpened 75% was often 35 percent
faster than 90 4k that's a huge win in
general the final example I want to look
at is Resident Evil 2 this game has
notoriously bad temporal anti-aliasing
which leads to a very soft often blurry
presentation sounds like the prime
candidate for some image sharpening
using random image sharpening on the
native 4k presentation basically it
fixes the soft image quality without
introducing the jagged edges or
shimmering you get with the game's SMA
implementation this is another great
low-cost use case for regular image
sharpening that is worth considering so
after all those comparisons all up I
think Radeon image sharpening is
genuinely quite impressive it doesn't
require developer implementation you can
just turn it on it sharpens the image
and that can be useful in a variety of
situations the big use case here is for
image down sampling with high-resolution
displays a sharpened 1800 peak image was
typically as good as a native 4k image
in my testing which means you can
happily use this configuration with Navi
GPS to gain around 30% more performance
for a minimal quality loss down sampling
all the way to 1440p didn't deliver as
good results here the sweet spot is
around that 70 to 80 percent resolution
scale brennon image sharpening is also
perfect for sharpening up games that can
be left a little sought-after
post-process anti-aliasing techniques
like ta a given basically all games
these days use this sort of
anti-aliasing as opposed to more
intensive techniques like MSAA or SSA a
combining that with sharpening can
deliver an improved image and as radiant
image sharpening only reduces
performance by a negligible 1 to 2
percent you can turn on without worrying
about much it's also clear that Radeon
image sharpening is
Jiri equivalent to invidious d LSS
opened by a considerable margin when we
set both techniques to perform at the
same frame rate brand image sharpening
delivered a clearer sharper image with
fewer artifacts relative to the DL SS
image in a lot of my DL SS anarthas
video as I said that a simple image
sharpening filter would probably work a
better than deal SS with a lower
performance cost and it turns out that
when aim D implemented that exact thing
with radiant image sharpening it was
actually better to be fair to in the
video when comparing images from the
same base resolution 1440p the DL SS
upscale version was superior to AMD
sharpened version but the key thing
holding Nvidia back here is the
performance cost of an enabling DSS if
that performance cost was zero DL SS
would be awesome but instead it's a
significant drop and that makes it kind
of worthless up against this simpler
sharpening implementation to make
matters worse for DSS Radeon image
sharpening is vastly more compatible
with today's games it works in all
direct x12 volcán and DirectX 9 titles
and while it is disappointing that dx11
isn't supported right now I think we'll
see support for that not too far away
for now though the library of supported
games is much larger than the small
collection for DL SS and that's down to
a embiez technique not requiring develop
intervention where DSS does it also
works at all resolutions on all Navi
cards whereas DL SS is restricted to
certain resolutions GPUs and often
quality levels retinal image sharpening
isn't perfect though in some situations
where the image is already quite sharp
at a native resolution sharpening can
lead to an artificial sharpened look so
in those cases it's not worth using
it also doesn't get everything right and
in some cases you know it can sharpen
things that shouldn't like artifacts and
it does make the image a bit brighter
but considering this is just faking it
for next to no performance cost and it
does improve image quality it's hard to
complain about a few minor things the
biggest of which probably being dx11
support at this stage to be honest right
on image sharpening is really what I was
hoping DSS would end up being a simple
low performance cost technique that
makes resolution down sampling viable
deal assist didn't deliver that with its
long list of limitations but radiant
image sharpening is pretty close I think
buyers of Navi GPUs will be really happy
with this extra feature and a
hope it gets the fanfare it deserves
