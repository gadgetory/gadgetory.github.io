it is time to review AMD's new third
generation rising processes and on hand
we have the horizon 9 3900 X and the
risin 730 700 X unfortunately these are
the only two CPUs
AMD has sent out to reviewers so the
horizon 5 processes and the 3100 X well
yeah who knows how they perform we'll
know shortly AMD will be sampling them
at a later date but we've just gone out
and purchased them so anyway at least
we've got these two it's certainly a lot
better than nothing
an AMD in their infinite wisdom also
decided to lift the review embargo for
both as n2 and Navi reviews at the same
time but we're going to delay Navi
review for a little bit just so you guys
can get those n2 stuff and the videos
aren't tripping over each other because
we know the YouTube algorithm doesn't
particularly like that and rather than
do one video that summarizes both Zen 2
and Navi we thought we'd just give you
all the juicy details on Zen 2 first but
why AMD didn't choose to dominate the
news cycle for a few weeks is beyond me
but maybe that's why I don't get paid
the big bucks anyway that's just about
enough winching from me we have a
boatload of information to go over and
since I know most of you really just
want to see the benchmark results I'm
not going to spend too much time going
over specs and pricing but before we get
into anything today's video sponsor is
Nord VP and right now they're offering
harbor on box viewers 75% off a
three-year membership when you use the
link in the video description and that
works out to be just 2 dollars 99 per
month which in my opinion is a very
small price to pay for your internet
security allowing you to browse download
and shop safely hardware and box gets
bombarded with advertising opportunities
from VPN services and today Nord VPN is
the only company we've worked with and
that's for good reason it's the only
service we use and trust
I've tried a number of different
services and they all came up short for
one reason or another but I can honestly
say Nord VPN is the best I've found and
having been a customer for well over
now I highly recommend you check them
out Nord VPN also offers a free 30 day
money-back guarantee so start protecting
your Internet experience they were 75%
off a three-year plan by using code
Harbor I boxed at Nord VPN comm forward
slash Harbor unboxed link is in the
video description ok so just quickly the
riser 930 900 X is a 12 core 24 thread
process and with a massive 64 megabyte
l3 cache it runs at a base frequency of
3.8 units with a boost frequency of 4.6
key guards it costs $500 us and that
places in direct competition with the
kora 999 hundred K then as I just said
we also have the horizon 730 700 X which
cost $330 u.s. and AMD suggests its
taking on the more expensive 99 hundred
K with this part anyway it has 8 cores
16 threads with a 32 megabyte l3 cache
and clocks anywhere from 3 point 6
gigahertz to 4.4 gigahertz both of these
third gen rising CPUs come with the
wraith prism RGB box color and i'll be
using that for the majority of our
testing this does mean intel will have a
slight performance advantage here but
please keep in mind the cost of the
cooler will be factored into our value
analysis for each processor that said I
will provide some 3900 X and 3700 X
performance figures using an all-in-one
liquid cooler as well the MSI x5 70
Croatian was used for testing the 3900 X
and 3700 X while the Isuzu rog crosshair
7 hero was used to test the 1st and 2nd
gen Rison processors all have been
tested with ddr4 3200 cell 14 memory but
there will also be some memory scaling
benchmarks included in the video as AMD
recommends using ddr4 3600 CL 16 memory
for best results so we will look into
that as for the eighth and ninth gen
Intel Core processors they were
benchmarked on the gigabyte z3 19 horas
ultra using the same ddr4 3200 cell 14
memory but they were cooled using the
corsair hydro series h 115 i RGB
platinum 280 millimeter all-in-one
liquid cooler please note that the intel
cpus are not TDP restricted as that's
not the typical out-of-the-box
experience so that means we're showing
the absolute best case scenario for
out-of-the-box performance finally the
graphics card of choice was the MSI
gaming extra
gee for 30 X 28 ETI okay I think that
covers pretty well everything let's get
in the benchmark results and maybe grab
a drink and some snacks before we get
started okay so where better to start
than Cinebench our twenties
multi-threaded benchmark and oh boy does
the Raisa 930 900 X look quite mighty
here scoring an incredible 7086 points
making it 24 percent faster than the
thread Ripper 2920 X and that really is
incredible moreover it completely
decimated the 99er okay by a forty-five
percent margin the Rison 730 700 X was
equally impressive the new a core part
match the 99 or okay and this meant it
was 22% faster than the 2,700 X and 30%
faster the more expensive 9700 K
needless to say these new third gen
rising paths are already looking like
kings of practive 'ti now just have to
say this one is a rather big deal here
the 3100 X matched the single core
performance of the nine are okay and
that meant it was 19% faster than the
2,700 X the 3700 X also did very well
hitting 500 points and that placed it
roughly on par with the 9700 K so this
is a massive performance improvement for
Verizon here we have some memory bound
with figures and this is sustained a
read/write performance as I said earlier
all CPUs here are using ddr4 3200 cell
14 memory but interestingly the third
gen processors are a little down on the
first and second gen but there is a good
reason for this and I will cover that a
bit later in the video when we're
exploring IPC performance for now let's
move on to check out a few application
benchmarks as you can see the change is
aimed in made with these n/2
architecture have had a profound impact
on WinRAR performance the 3,700 X is
unbelievably 84 percent faster than the
2,700 X allowing it to comfortably beat
the 87 or okay and almost match the core
I 9 at 7,900 X the 3900 X also put on
quite the show though it was only 15%
faster and the 3700 X and it couldn't
quite match the 9 y ahora que still
overall a remarkable performance uplift
here over the second gen parts moving on
the 7-zip
and first up we have the compression
test where traditionally Rison hasn't
really done that well for example you
can see how the 2700 X is 14 percent
slower than the nine to 900k
however all that looks to have changed
here with the third iteration of horizon
as we see the 3,700 X easily brushing
aside the 9900 cave by a 15% margin
basically matching the ten-course 7900 x
then we see the 3900 X beating the 29:20
X by an 11% margin and the 9900 K by a
whopping 45 percent margin so yeah king
of productivity it looks like I already
said that but damn these productivity
results are impressive then when it
comes to decompression work third
generation still enjoys a handy
performance advantage here the 3700 X
was 11% faster than the 9900 K and a
whopping 52% faster than the 9700 K
meanwhile the 3900 X was a little over
60% faster than the 9900 K and even
offered a 17% performance uplift over
the thread Ripper 29:20 X now this
result really gets me quite excited if
the previous ones haven't already as I
use premier on an almost daily basis and
I'm currently doing so with a thread
Ripper 2950 X here we see the 3900 X is
8% fast in the 29:20 X so this means the
3950 X will beat the 2950 X quite
comfortably when it's released in a few
months time and with that I can't even
imagine what the third gen 3 Ripper
series will be able to deliver anyway
here the 3900 X was 22% faster than the
9900 K and that's no small performance
uplift in fact even the 3700 X edged out
the 9900 K making it 25% faster than the
9700 K and then what makes these results
even more impressive is the fact that
premiere is a very pro Intel piece of
software so that is to say it's quite
biased towards Intel AMD is shown the
3100 X to be a little over 50% faster
than the 1900 in DaVinci Resolve and
yeah I know I need to get a DaVinci
project sorted out so I can start adding
that to our benchmarks and I promise
I'll get that done soon
but anyway the results in premier are
still very very impressive
moving along first up we have the older
1.0.8 version of the v-ray benchmark and
I've included this because well I had
all the data for the previous processes
and I thought well might as well just
add the third gen processors and show
you how they can pair anyway using this
older version the 30 100x took just 48
seconds to complete the workload while
the 3700 X took just 68 seconds
this means although the 3700 X was
slightly slower than the 9900 K it was
much faster than the 9700 K meanwhile
the 3900 X beat absolutely everything
including the twenty nine twenty X we
also see very similar margins in the
newest version of the v-ray benchmark
though here the core i7 70 100x does
manage to edge ahead of the twenty nine
twenty X despite that though the 3900 X
easily conquered all while the 3700 X
wasn't much slower than the 99 hundred K
so another strong result for AMD similar
margins are also seeing when testing
with Corona the 3900 X was 30% faster in
the 1990 K while the 3700 X was just 10%
slower than the core own own processor
the 3700 X was also 12 percent faster
than the 2700 X certainly not its most
extreme performance uplift over the
second gen Rison part but certainly
decent all the same the last application
I'm going to look at is blender and once
again we see similar margins between the
tests and processors though this time
they're 3,700 X is much closer to the
9900 K than it is to the 2700 X while
running the blender open data benchmark
I also measured the entire system power
draw so let's check out those results
before getting into the gaming
benchmarks well would you look at that
the 3700 X consumed less power than the
2600 X quite a bit less and even less
than the 8700 K in fact it was
comparable to the our five twenty six
hundred and sixteen hundred along with
the old quad-core 7700 K and just as a
remarkable
was the 3900 X which was comparable to
the 2700 X and 17900 X making it world
more efficient than the 1900 okay and
29:20 X it's pretty crazy when you
realize that the 3900 X was 41% faster
than the 9900 K in blender and yet it
reduced total system consumption by 8%
that really is a stellar result for AMD
and on that high note I'm going to
cautiously move into the gaming
benchmarks right so starting with
Assassin's Creed Odyssey the new third
generation processors are around 10%
fast and the 2,700 X which is quite a
good result really but it's not good
enough to beat the 9900 K at least when
looking at the average framerate despite
similar frame time performance the 1900
K was 4% faster on average at 1080p with
an RT X xx atti I know this is really
close enough to call a tie so let's see
what happens at 1440p oddly we don't see
a coming together of the results at
1440p like you would expect but rather
the 9900 K is now six percent faster
than the 13 I her X and even more
bizarre is the fact that the 29 20 X is
now matching the 3900 X though to be
fair it wasn't too far behind at LEP so
perhaps all that extra memory bandwidth
is coming in handy at 1440p then we see
that the 97 or ek was also 6 percent
faster than 3700 X again not a big
margin but I was hoping to see less of a
gap at 1440p right so these results are
a little bit disappointing well maybe
that's a bit too harsh
after all the third gen rising parts
were both 11% fast on the 2,700 X and
that is another decent performance gain
the problem is they're both well down on
the 99er case average and 1% low
performance the 99er K was 8% faster an
average and 13% fast and we're looking
at the 1% low result again certainly not
a massive margin but given the slides
that we'd seen from AMD I have to admit
I was hoping for more still it is worth
noting that at 1440p the 99 hurricane
was just 4% faster
3,900 X and generally anything within a
5 percent margin I declare as a draw so
at least under these more typical gaming
conditions there's almost nothing in it
but that still doesn't change the fact
that the 99 RK is the superior gamer or
at least it is for today's games now
he's our biggest deficit yet this time
the 99 her ok was 17% faster than the
1300 X when comparing the average frame
rate and 20% faster for the 1% low
result the 3700 X did do better relative
to the 9700 K but again gaming still
looks to me advantage Intel bumping the
resolution up to 1440p does reduce the
margins quite heavily and now the 1900
ok was just 8% faster for the average
frame rate and this is certainly a more
realistic resolution for an RT X xx atti
I have to admit I was hoping these third
gen rising processes would be a little
more punchy in the division 2 but don't
get me wrong the gameplay was still
incredibly smooth but even so the 9900 K
was still 11% faster than the 13900 X
but with similar 1% low performance the
horizon process is really worse smooth
operators then as we move to 1440p as
you'd probably expect in this game we're
now entirely GPU bound with these
higher-end CPUs and this allowed the
9900 K 9700 K 3,700 X and 3900 X to all
deliver identical performance next up we
have far cry new dawn and this tile
along with previous installments in this
series have always been troublesome for
AMD rising processors here we see the
2700 X allowing for just 98 FPS on
average and that made the 9900 K 26%
faster the new 3rd gen rising parts
don't completely solve this issue but
they do dramatically push things in the
right direction for AMD and as a result
we see that the 1900 K is now just 10%
faster than both the 3100 X and a 3700 X
then at 1440p the margin is reduced even
further as you'd probably expect and now
it's just the 1% lower results that
noticeably favor the Intel 8 core
processors
the deficit seen in FirePro new dorm was
a little disappointing and the same can
be said when discussing the World War Z
results in fact this is by far the most
disappointing result we've seen and
that's because the third gen Rison
processors are no faster than the 2700 X
this means the 99 hurricane was 18% fast
in the 3900 X and the 9700 K was 21%
faster than the 3700 X so whatever it is
that pasteurizing processors don't like
about World War Z this latest generation
isn't able to address even at the more
GPU limited 1440p the 9900 K was still
able to beat the 3900 X by a 9% margin
so again not an ideal result for AMD
moving on we have some rage to results
in here the 3900 X and a 3700 X do
perform very well offering slightly
better 1% low performance than the 2700
X which puts them on par with 3,700 K
having said a lot though we do see that
the 99 hurricane 9700 K offers slightly
better 1% low performance around 7%
better not really a big deal here and as
you might expect the gaming experience
was virtually identical that at 1440p
were entirely GPU bound with these
higher and CPUs from the 3700 X up we're
able to get the most out of the our 2 X
20 80 TI hitman 2 is another one of
those titles that's never been that
friendly with AMD rise and processes and
we see that it's still an issue for the
third gen parts here the 9900 K beat the
3900 X by a 15 percent margin though
that's nothing like the 27% margin it
beats the 2700 X by so there is that
once again the margins of 1440p are
heavily reduced and now the 1900 can't
fast in the 3900 X the 3700 X was still
9 percent faster than 2700 X so the
third gen rising series have really made
a good step forward here when it comes
to gaming finally the last game that
we're going to look at is total war
three kingdoms and this is a solid
result for AMD the 3700 X was able to
improve the 1% low performance of the
2700 X by an 8 percent margin making it
just 1% slower than the 9900 K and 5%
slower than the 9700 K which actually
does a little
better in this title without
hyper-threading then a 1440p were once
again almost entirely GPU bound leaving
just a frame or two in it at the most so
I think that's a pretty good spot to
wrap up the gaming benchmarks and I
think we'll move on to take a quick look
at some memory scaling or at least our
ddr4 3,200 and 3,600 compare ddr4 3600
is the fastest memory spec AMD
recommends using with third generation
CPUs as higher clocked memory will
actually reduce performance at least
when clocked higher than 37:33 as this
changes the Infinity fabric to a two to
one mode rather than a one to one mode
basically true to one sees the Infinity
fabric clocked at a quarter of the
memory speed while one to one is half
since AMD did recommend ddr4 3,600
memory for optimal performance and
provided reviewers with a CL 16 kit I
thought I'd better test it out just to
make sure we're not hampering
performance by using the CL 1430 200 kit
the good news is we're not here you'll
see virtually identical performance in
Corona WinRAR far cry new dawn
Assassin's Creed Odyssey and World War Z
unfortunately due to Tom I didn't get a
whole lot of memory testing done but
this is something I will followup with
providing a much more detailed video in
the near future at the request of many
of our patreon members I also took a
quick look at chipset performance
comparing be 452 X 570 using the MSI be
450 tomahawk and X 570 creation I didn't
include necks 470 board again Judah time
and given we know B 450 and X 470 boards
deliver the same performance you should
be able to fill in the gaps pretty
easily they're looking at the Cinebench
scores there appears to be a slight
performance advantage in favor of the X
570 board but we're only talking at 1%
difference which is within the margin of
error though the results did always
favor the X 570 board when taking an
average of three runs enabling PBO plus
order OC in the risin Master we again
see similar performance on the x5 70 and
B 450 boards and as claimed by AMD the
PBO feature of the third generation
processors can be enabled on all
motherboards that support these
processors and just lastly a quick look
at
performance with World War Z and again
very similar performance on both boards
I will have a much more in-depth video
soon looking at B 350 and X 370
motherboards but given the time I had
allocated for this review we're gonna
have to settle with the B 450 versus X
570 comparison moving on we have some
IPC testing and for this I've clocked
the 99 or okay 3,700 X 2700 X and 1700 X
at 4 gigahertz using the same ddr4 3200
cell 14 memory the results I have to say
are quite staggering
whereas clock for clock the 2700 X is 4
percent slower than the 99 or ok the
3700 X is 13% faster I don't really know
what to say about that it's a pretty
amazing result so I guess there you have
it AMD certainly weren't stretching of
truth when they claimed a 15%
improvement in IPC over second gen Rison
here we're seeing an 18 percent
improvement interestingly though we do
only see an 11 percent boost in single
core performance but even so that's
still a massive generational jump and
that means the 3,700 X was still 7%
faster than the 9900 K when matched
clock for clock
despite the mind-blowing Cinebench
results the 99er EK is still able to
show these young feisty rising
processors who's boss when it comes to
gaming clock for clock the 99 Herrera K
was still 10 percent faster than the
3700 X however perhaps more shocking is
the fact that in this particular tile
the 3700 X was just 2% faster than the
2,700 X I guess this explains why the
results in this particular title and
others such as far cry new dawn were a
little more disappointing than we were
hoping for still we do see quite a
different story when testing with
battlefield 5 at least when comparing
these second and third generation
processors here the 3700 X provided an 8
percent performance boost over the 2700
x1 both were locked at these same 4
gigahertz frequency
despite that though the 9900 K was still
7 percent faster than the 3700 X so why
is that well once again a big part of
the issue is called a call latency but
the
uses AMD's made massive strides forward
in this area taking quarter call latency
from around 81 nanoseconds down to just
56 nanoseconds and that's a 30%
reduction in latency
this also means cortical communication
is just 11% slow and compared to the
9900 Kay and that's a big part of why
we're seeing third gen rising close in
on the 99 records gaming performance but
also why it's still not quite there yet
also just lastly something that seemed a
bit odd at first when I discovered it is
the memory write performance of third
gen risin it's significantly down on the
first and second gen parts AMD's made a
compromise here as client workloads do
very little writing so rather than use
this space to improve something that
isn't really going to boost performance
overall they've invested this silicon
real estate in more beneficial ways to
achieve tangible performance gains so
whereas the core complex dye to iodine
link for reading memory is 32 bytes wide
it's only 16 bytes wide for writing and
this is why the peak write bandwidth is
effectively cut in half now time for the
overclocking results and again due to
limited time I didn't do as much testing
here as I would have liked but it seems
pretty clear that just like the first
and second generation CPUs there's a
very little overclocking Headroom to
speak of with these third gen rising
processors and this really isn't that
surprising both AMD and Intel locked in
a fierce battle which sees both trying
to extract the maximum amount of
performance they can from these high-end
CPUs at best I was able to boost the
3900
X's multi-core score by 4% while a 3700
X or a 6% increase however as was the
case with second generation the simple
multiplier OC method that I used for the
4.3 gigahertz or core overclock is not
really the method you want to be using
here we see when looking at the single
core results it does reduce performance
leaving PBO overclocking as the most
effective method overall still I feel
that most won't bother overclocking to
extract that extra four to six percent
performance and from what I've heard
from other reviewers 4.3 gigahertz seems
to be one of the better over clocks at
least for the 3900 X on an even more
disappointing note I somehow managed to
end the life of my 39
X there's really no delicate way to say
it at this stage of the review yeah I
managed to kill my risin nine 3900 X
processor I'm not sure exactly what
settings were applied I know I hadn't
got into manually adjusting the voltage
yet I was letting the board handle it
I'm not going to specify which board it
was because these were very early biases
that yeah well there were a few biases
that hadn't been fully validated anyway
I believe I was
well after testing 4.3 gigahertz and I
decided to again leave the voltage on
auto and then increase the LLC to see if
I could well see what impact that had on
temperatures and stuff like that I was
just messing around it's a very very
late at night I wasn't fully paying
attention to what I was doing but I
certainly certainly never expected to
kill the processor in all my years and
never ever run into a problem like this
anyway booted up into Windows I wasn't
really voltage monitoring so maybe my
bad anyway I only ran a Cinebench 20
pass or multi-core pass which doesn't
run for particularly a long time anyway
it crashed about halfway through reset
the system and sadly it never booted up
again the CPU now gets stuck at code 0 7
which is AP initialization after
microcode I tried another completely
different X 570 board from a different
brand so completely different board and
I got the exact same post code error
then after trying the B 450 tomahawk
once that was flashed up and working
with the 3700 X I tried the 3900 X and
yes sadly it was it was declared
completely dead at that point did not
boot up at all AMD assures me that no
other reviewers have managed to kill
their 3900 X so I guess I'm just special
or unlucky I'll let you guys pick on
that one AMD has sent me a replacement
but unfortunately it hasn't arrived in
time for me to update any of the testing
that I didn't get done obviously in this
review they'll be arriving well tomorrow
so Monday and then I can get on with a
few more tests I want to do like try the
3100 X on B 450 motherboards add it to
our IPC testing so we can see how to
chip 'let's impact the results there
anyway that
what happened so extremely unfortunate
in all my years never ever had this
problem but obviously CPUs do have a
defective rate as small as it is so
maybe it wasn't anything to do with the
early biases it was just just a bad chip
unfortunately the death of my 3900 ex
also means I don't have any temperature
data at all so for this we're just gonna
have to settle for what I better collect
with the 3700 X basically with the
Wraith prism RGB Box cooler you can get
pretty close to extracting maximum
performance out of 3700 X though it does
get a little toasty but on the bright
side the cooler is very quiet so 87
degrees for the overclock is very
respectable of course if you are gonna
overclock I recommend an aftermarket
cooler you certainly don't need
something as expensive as the Corsair
hydro series h1 15 I but that's what I
had available for testing and as you can
see after an hour long blender stress
test the 3700 X peaked at just 73
degrees it's a shame I don't have the
3900 X results but I suspect with the
Box cooler it runs at around 80 degrees
stock under heavy load of course all the
results for the 3900 X seen in this
video we're recorded with the Box cooler
as I noted earlier
ok so we've now seen how these new third
generalize and processors perform it's
time to work out if you should actually
buy them and what do they offer in terms
of value so let's move on to do that
looking at the current asking prices you
paying quite a premium for these new
CPUs when compared to the second gen
parts but that's really hardly
surprising when compared to the Intel
competition purely for gaming the 3700 X
is on par with the 9700 K and 8700 K in
terms of value the 3900 X doesn't stack
up quite as well here and this means the
99er K is actually quite a bit better in
terms of value or is it while the 3900 X
comes with a box cooler
none of the Intel case Q parts do so
let's add in the cost of a good air
cooler and then recalculate the cost per
frame what I asked on Twitter most of
you seem to agree that the be quiet dark
rock 4 for $75 was a reasonable pairing
for the 99er okay and 9700 K so I've
added that to the budget for the K
processes factoring in the cooler means
the 39 her ex is now better value than
the 9900 K and the 3700 ex is very
similar to the core i5 9600 K
motherboard costs are much the same
really so it's just the cooler that
those considering Intel need to account
for as for AMD second and first
generation processors well they're
bloody cheap these days so it makes it
hard to compare them with these new
third gen rising parts still the 3700 X
cost just 14% more per frame than the
2700 X and given the massive power
savings an improvement in single and
lightly threaded workloads I think it's
well worth that premium so it'll be
interesting to see how the horizon 5
3600 stacks up against the r5 2600 and
1600 when I test it in a few days time
moving on from gaming let's take a quick
look at a few applications starting with
blender on this scatter graph you
ideally want to be as low as possible
and as far to the right as possible as
you can see the 3700 X is not only much
lower on the graph than the 97 okay but
it's also much further to the right
indicating significantly better price to
performance the 39 her X is also
significantly lower than the 9900 K but
much more to the right as it's
significantly more affordable and much
faster we see a similar story in premier
the competing AMD processors are all
situated lower on the graph and further
to the right making them not just more
affordable but also faster okay so
despite the fact that I've already
blurted out over 4,000 words and
wherever 50 graphs is deep into this
review I feel like there is a lot more
that I would like to cover and I guess
that's partly because my 3100 X testing
was cut so short nevertheless we have
covered all the essentials in this
review and you should now have a pretty
good idea of how the riser 930 100x and
rise in seven 3,700 compared to the
current generation Intel CPUs I also
have a very very nice-looking range of X
570 motherboards that I've been checking
out over the past week but
I'll save getting into all those until a
little bit later on for now just enjoy
the b-roll shots likewise I have a few
really impressive PCIe gen 4 SSDs but
again I'll save that testing for a
future video but as I said the x5 70
boards are really nice and so are the
high speed SSDs but truth be told
neither are required to get the most out
of these new 3rd gen rising processors
rather I feel they just complement them
at the high end so suitable for you 3900
X for example and that being the case I
feel for the most part the x5 70 boards
particularly the more premium models
should only be paired with the 39 her X
or the upcoming 39 50 X for those
grabbing the 3700 X and especially the
more affordable Verizon 5 3600 models
I'd recommend existing X 470 and B 450
motherboards and my personal preference
right now is either the MSI B 450
tomahawk or the gaming carbon Pro ac and
if you want to know more about those
boards then check out our B 450 vrm
thermal testing video I have to say I've
noticed a lot of commotion regarding
these X 570 motherboards namely their
pricing but it really doesn't matter
given that you can fully unleash these
into processes on B 450 motherboards and
probably even be 350 boards and I'll set
about testing that shortly
as for PCIe gen 4 SSDs yeah look they're
really nice but again truth is for
gaming and general usage they're not
worth paying a premium for there's a
good chance you won't even notice the
difference over existing PCIe gen3
models so bear that in mind but of
course for those of you who need that
extra bandwidth for whatever reason
you're probably better off waiting for
thread Ripper as it'll offer many more
PCIe lanes and likely be more useful in
that regard
ok so let's talk about the gaming
results as I suspect these will be
causing the greatest stir in the
comments section below
annoyingly AMD did lead us to believe
that the 3900 X and 99 or K would be
neck-and-neck trade blows even but that
doesn't appear to be the case
the end result that was far from bad and
third gen risin has generally shown a
really big step forward for AMD moreover
under realistic gaming conditions
there's almost no chance you'd be able
to tell the difference between the 9900
K the 3100 X or the 3700 X as the
difference at 1440p with an RT X 2082 I
was incredibly small
after all the 3100 X was just 8% sir on
average at 1080p so ambhi's basically
half - the deficit to Intel in gaming
and it was already questionable as to
how much of a difference it really made
then as we found previously with Rison
for almost anything outside of gaming of
3900 X berries the 99er okay while the
3700 delivers comparable performance but
this time when it comes to power
consumption the new third gen rise and
processors are extremely efficient and
head and shoulders above Intel's ninth
gen parts so if you're just interested
in gaming performance I'd recommend the
3700 X and probably the six core 3600
models and as I said I'll cover those
soon but if for whatever reason you want
the absolute fastest gaming CPU then
that still either Intel's 9700 K or 9900
K but value for money they really aren't
great at the moment and there is no
upgrade path and like I said for most
gaming scenarios the difference won't be
realized in my opinion Intel really
needs to cut pricing and I'm not sure a
15% price drop will be enough now for
those of you who use your PC for work so
perhaps your game on your PC but you're
also use it for productivity much like
myself and maybe for content creation or
well really any other heavy productivity
task well then these new rise and CPUs
are really in a league of their own and
this makes the 99er ok a bit of a
one-trick pony now overall the new rise
in 3000 series is everything I hoped it
would be it's a big step forward from
the 2000 series and the improvements in
power efficiency and nothing short of
amazing I'm really pleased with the
pricing surely no one can complain with
what AMD is offering at these price
points and if this doesn't force Intel
to adjust
pricing I'm pretty confident nothing
will and that is going to do it for this
one there is much more testing to come
so don't worry about that we'll have
plenty more testing over the next few
days and then of course later today
tomorrow depending on where you're
situated in the world we will have our
in-depth Navi coverage as well so make
sure you keep an eye out for that and of
course if you did like this video then
please feel free to give it a like you
can drop a comment below and let us know
what you think about AMD's new rise and
processes very keen to hear what you
guys think I reckon they'll be a bit of
a discussion around if a gaming
performance also you can join us over on
patreon for a few cool perks such as
access to our exclusive discord server
and then our monthly live stream Tim and
I'll be doing that in about a week's
time and there's going to be a lot of
interesting stuff there that will be
discussed including my 3900 ex that
unfortunately died anyway thank you for
watching I'm your host Steve and I'll
see you again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
