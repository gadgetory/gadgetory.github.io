sponsoring our Computex 2018 coverage
check out Corsairs fancy new Vengeance
RGB memory and don't forget to arm
yourself with the game-changing
performance that only msi geforce gtx
ten series graphics cards can deliver
give yourself the competitive edge
you're looking for even in the most
challenging titles fast powerful and
made to game visit the link in the
description now to learn more welcome
back to hardware unboxed we're getting
towards the end of Computex 2018 now and
while there haven't been as many
announcements at the show as we would
have liked to see clearly the biggest
most exciting reveal was AMD's 32 cores
64 thread thread Ripper 2 CPU that is
scheduled for release in just a few
months but the day before
AMD's press event here in Taipei Intel
came out on stage and revealed a
suspicious 28 core CPU running at 5
gigahertz on all cores which certainly
sent the internet into a flurry at the
time now it didn't cover the 28 core
announcement here on the channel because
quite clearly the CPU is not a real
product that will be coming to market in
the form Intel showed it and we're more
interested in stuff that you guys will
actually be able to get your hands on
but I think it's worth talking about
this CPU and Intel's announcements
because it quite clearly shows the
difference between Intel and AMD 's
current high-end desktop strategies one
company is talking about actual consumer
hardware at Computex 2018 while the
other is demonstrating ridiculous
garbage that to be honest really serves
no purpose other than to generate
headlines so let's go back to the
initial reveal of Intel's 28 core 5
gigahertz CPU during their Computex 2018
keynote they showed this massive CPU
running at 5 gigahertz on all twenty
eight cores and then manage to get it
running a Cinebench multi-threaded
workload that produced an appropriately
huge score a lot of people went crazy
over this revelation and headlines were
generated everywhere which is pretty
much exactly what Intel wanted knowing
full well that AMD would be
overshadowing them the next day with the
32 core thread Ripper CPU but when this
news hit Steve and I were immediately
quite suspicious about how exactly Intel
managed to get this 28 core CPU running
all cores at 5 gigahertz
it was quite clearly not a consumer
product and not something that will ever
be reaching the market in any real
capacity at least at the frequencies
Intel is running it out on stage Intel
did say the CPUs shown is a prototype
and will be released in quarter four but
I'll get to that a bit later after in
tilted their demonstration various
youtubers like Paul from Paul's hardware
went over to the gigabyte suite and
exposed the Intel test system shown on
stage and lo and behold the CPU in
question is called using a massive air
conditioning unit that's bringing the
liquid cooling systems temperatures down
to sub ambient levels that's red flag
number one then you look at the
motherboard they're using it's a massive
enterprise board using the LGA 36:47
socket which is normally used for
intel's top-end xeon processors and at
the top of the board is an outrageous 28
phase or there abouts vrm solution with
a huge heatsink and additional cooling
clearly capable of delivering massive
amounts of power to this prototype cpu
and that's red flag number two now when
you join the dots together here it's
quite obvious what we're looking at as
gamers nexus has discussed previously
this is just an existing top-end xeon
processor like the 28 quart Xeon
Platinum 8180 tucked into a board
capable of extreme power delivery
attached to exotic cooling than
overclock to the absolute maximum
presumably the xeon chip was also been
to a ridiculous degree such that a 5
gigahertz all core overclock could be
achieved in fact just a few hours ago
Intel confirmed to an and tech that the
demonstration was indeed using an
overclocked CPU and was intended as an
overclocking demo not that the company
mentioned that on stage overclocking
chips like this using exotic cooling is
fine and something we see enthusiasts
doing all the time but it's pretty
disingenuous to say the CPU is coming to
the market in q4 there is absolutely no
way we're getting a 5 gigahertz 28 core
CPU as either a desktop part or as a
server part maybe we'll get a 28 core
CPU that hits 5 gigahertz as a single
called turbo frequency but 5 gigahertz
all core when the flagships zealand
platinum 8180 tops out at 3.2 gigahertz
all core yeah that's definitely not
happening what Intel did at Computex is
the equivalent of saying in i7 8700 k is
a 7 gigahertz CPU yeah sure it can hit 7
gigahertz as an overclock part on an
extremely high-end motherboard with
exotic cooling like ln2
but no consumer is buying an
8700 K and hitting seven gigahertz in
typical scenarios they will be able to
overclock it above Intel's rated
specifications but not the extremes
possible with Chile's bolted onto the
CPU and this is all in stark contrast to
AMD's announcement for thread Ripper to
their 32 core CPU is actually a real
product and it's likely coming to market
in August it will be available for
consumers they will be able to put it in
existing x99 boards and they'll be able
to achieve the performance AMD showed on
stage after all AMD's demo had their CPU
clocked at 3 gigahertz base and a 3.4
gigahertz or core boost all running on
air cooling with the wraith ripper we've
shown off before that's a totally
reasonable configuration for standard
users of AMD's thread Ripper platform in
fact a.m. these prototype thread Ripper
232 core CPU had a TDP of 250 watts
while intel's 5 gigahertz 28 core CPU
could easily have been 500 watts or even
one kilowatt with the overclock they
were using it's not even in the same
ballpark
Ami's thread Ripper to launch was a
reflection of reality a real CPU with
real specs that you'll actually be able
to purchase Intel's 5 gigahertz 28 core
CPU is a pure fantasy for most users and
basically this is where things currently
sit with Intel and Amy's HDD T platforms
AMD quite easily had the capacity to
push up to 32 cores with thread Ripper 2
on the exact same tr4 socket and X 399
platform after all they already have a
32 core epic CPU on the market so it
wasn't exactly difficult for them to
bring that technology over to h EDT they
didn't need to reinvent anything they
simply upped the number of active dies
on thread Ripper from 2 to 4 and bam
there's the 32 cord consumer desktop CPU
Ami's brilliant multi die approach with
the Infinity fabric interconnect makes
this jump from 16 to 32 cores quite
straightforward the development work on
the Infinity fabric is now bearing fruit
ripe for picking as incredibly high
performance desktop CPUs
Intel on the other hand practically has
their hands tied as far as HDD TCPS are
concerned their top-end core I 979 ATX e
pushes 18 cores on the X 299 and LGA
2011 platform basically pushing that
platform to the limits in terms of core
count their server chips top out at just
28 cause
a single massive dye with low yields on
a completely different socket and
platform at prices exceeding 8,000 US
dollars to compete with thread Ripper -
Intel is being forced to rip out their
LGA 3647 socket from their Xeon server
line and shove it into high-end desktop
motherboards then they have to take
their top-end Xeon 28 core chip that
normally retails for $10,000 and
possibly push clocks even higher than
what that chip offers all while
remaining competitive on pricing they're
stuck in a very hard place and it's
showing as desperation with their
ridiculous and misleading 5 gear Hertz
demo at Computex this year so I'm very
interested to see exactly what Intel
does with their HDD t line towards the
end of the year and what their 5
gigahertz 28 core CPU actually becomes
for consumers we know pretty well what
thread reputable providers and actual
chip consumers will be able to purchase
but Intel CPU isn't going to come close
to what they were showing off at
Computex this year just needed to get my
thoughts on the whole 28 core 5
gigahertz CPU out there let me know what
you think about Intel's Computex
announcements and thread Ripper 2 in the
comments below
