corner there has been a ton of news come
out this week probably the biggest of
which was the launch of AMD second gen
Rison processor so if you haven't
already seen our 32 minute long review
of the Rison 720 700 X and Rison 520 600
X you should probably do so aside from
Rison though there's been a lot of other
interesting stories to emerge this week
AMD and Asus have basically confirmed
the nvidia geforce partner program is
true intel accidentally revealed its
eight core coffee-like processor new
free sync to HD our monitor
announcements and a couple of other
goodies and before I get into it if you
are a supporter of us on patreon there
is a new behind the scenes video
available for you guys right now that
details how Steve and I built this set
including some interesting footage of us
putting it together so check that out at
patreon.com slash Hardware unboxed let's
get straight into the news aside from
second gen rising the biggest story this
week surrounds once again the NVIDIA
GeForce Partner Program on cheap ap this
has been a highly controversial topic
since it was uncovered more than a month
ago with lots of rumors and speculation
surrounding invidious anti-competitive
move to force companies into a lying
their well-known gaming brands with
NVIDIA GeForce while the original story
from hard OCP was well source and it did
seem accurate face value it's always
hard to know exactly what to believe
when OMS and other industry sources
refused to discuss the issue this and a
lack of other strong evidence is kind of
live being a bit quiet on the topic is
you know we did continue to look into it
but luckily this week we're no longer
relying on anonymous sources of rumors
as AMD and the actions of one board
partner have basically confirmed the GPP
story to be true so let's start with the
suits who this week announced that they
will be launching a new brand for their
Radeon graphics card called Ares this
brand is replacing ROG for their AMD
products which effectively makes ROG and
NVIDIA exclusive brand as the GPB news
suggested would happen the good news is
a su sub brands like Strix
Phoenix and jewel have transitioned over
to the new Aries brand so Radeon cards
that were once our og Strix are
basically now going to be Ares Strix
there's a lot of spinning this
announcement as you'd expect with the SU
saying the new brand underlines the
strong working partnership between a
soos and AMD that spans decades and
there's no direct acknowledgement of the
GPP but it's pretty clear what is
driving this change and it's definitely
frustrating that underhanded agreements
have forced a soos into creating a new
lesser-known brand for AMD's products
AMD themselves have also addressed the
GPP for the first time in a roundabout
sort of way posting an article on the
gamers choice and acknowledging that
adding board partners will be launching
new brands for Radeon cards in the
coming weeks again AMD doesn't directly
name in video all the GPP in this
article but they do clearly attack some
of invidious unsavory practices in fact
there are some golden quotes in this
article the main ones being these brands
will share the same values of openness
innovation and inclusivity that most
gamers tacked to Hart the freedom to
tell others in the industry that they
won't be boxed into choosing proprietary
solutions that come bundled with gamer
taxes just to enjoy great experiences
they should rightfully have access to
later
AMD mentions they won't penalize gamers
with proprietary technology taxes a
clear reference to gsync and that there
are no anti gamer slash anti-competitive
strings attached strong words there but
definitely warranted I think in this
situation an AMD corporate VP Scott
herkiman who wrote this blog post on
AMD's website also took to Twitter today
following AMD's sales event in London in
his tweet her Coleman says how many
partners told me how our competition
tries to use funding and allocation to
restrict or block your ability to market
and sell radeon based products in the
manner you and your customers desire he
also asks any others who have
experienced similar issues to come reach
out what happens with the GPP from here
remains to be seen though I suspect
there will be continued investigation
into it not just by people like us but
also various regulators will also see
companies like MS
and gigabyte who are heavily rumored to
be GPP participants launch new Radeon
graphics card brands in the coming weeks
although some reports have suggested
major companies like HP and Dell have
refused to sign on we're also a way to
go an nvidia to clarify there supposedly
transparent geforce partner program for
us all they've yet to do that and I'm
not really sure whether they ever will
this next topic concerns Intel and I
think at this point we all know thanks
to various rumors that eight core
coffee-like processes and the Zed 390
chipset are coming at some point however
this week for the first time Intel if
somewhat officially revealed that an
8-core coffee-like s processor in other
words an eight core CPU for the
mainstream desktop platform does
actually exist the revelation comes
through documentation on intel's
official technical documentation website
several documents with spotted that show
a coffee like s8 plus two product
perhaps published ahead of time by
accident the eight plus two in the
product name refers to eight cpu cores
along with two GPU cores the actual
documents couldn't be accessed as they
were protected by a login screen not the
most surprising revelation but it is
always nice to know a rumor product is
actually a real product for those alike
monitors this week both AOC and bank you
have announced free sync to HDR monitors
you might have forgotten by now because
the announcement was so long ago but
free sync to is AMD's newer monitors
standard that's not just provides
adaptive sync but also includes support
for HDR and low latency gaming freezing
to or more thoroughly validate monitors
across a wide range of metrics as well
ensuring precinct 2 monitors are of a
high quality anyway we have seen one
line of free sync two monitors in the
past on samsung so these two new
displays from AOC and Bank you are
somewhat of a second wave the AOC
monitor is the AG 322 QC for a 32 inch
curved 1440p 144 Hertz v a panel with
display HDR 400 certification as a
contrast ratio of 2,000 to 1 400 nits of
peak brightness and formula second
response times thanks to free sync to
certification it will support up to 90%
of
DCI p3 color gamut which is key for
proper HDR support that the maximum
brightness of 400 nits is a bit on the
weak side for HDR content the AG 322 QC
4 will be available in Europe in June
for 529 pounds or $5.99 euros BenQ
appears to be using the same panel in
its free sink to monitor the ex3 to 0-3
R so again it's a 30 1.5 inch curved
1440p 144 Hertz of V a panel it also
supports 90% of DCI p3 and 400 nits peak
brightness they are not sure if it packs
display HDR certification there's no
word on pricing or release date for bank
use variant intel has announced threat
detection technology at the annual RSA
conference this week which does provide
some interesting new security features
I'm not going to cover everything that
was announced as part of the overall TDT
package but one particular aspect
accelerated memory scanning or AMS is
particularly interesting and could have
significant implications for malware
scanning performance basically AMS
allows malware scanning to be offloaded
to the integrated GPU in Intel 6th gen
skylake processors or newer this frees
up the CPU during memory scans and
should reduce power consumption the main
focus of AMS is scanning for in memory
malware which is quite a high CPU usage
task and in their testing with Windows
Defender advanced threat protection
software Intel saw a reduction from 20
percent to 2 percent CPU utilization
after offloading this task to the GPU
the goal here is to improve system
responsiveness while running malware
scanning software I think overall it
does look pretty promising Coolermaster
have got some fancy new liquid coolers
the master liquid ml 120 R and the
master liquid ml 240 R as the name
suggests one has a 120 ml radiator while
the other has a 240 ml radiator the key
feature here is the crazy RGB Serpa both
the CPU block and fans which of course
can be hooked up to the light control
headers on most motherboards the ML 120
R will cost 100 bucks while the ML 240 R
will be 120 US dollars strong reports
have emerged this week suggesting call
of duty
black ops 4 will have no single-player
campaign we probably won't be missing
out on much considering colleges
single-player modes have never been that
good but it's interesting they've
decided to remove it in this particular
version on another report has also
suggested there will be a probe royale
mode because of course every multiplayer
game in 2018 needs to have battle royale
mode final story for this week relates
to a couple of phones Sony has launched
the Xperia XZ 2 premium which packs a
5.7 inch 4k HDR display a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 845 and a dual sensor rear
camera into a bezel heavy package Sony's
been struggling in the smartphone world
for a while now so I'm not sure whether
this premium phone is enough to attract
customers and I'd expect it to cost a
fair bit on the cheaper front motorola
has launched a range of budget handsets
including the Moto G 6g 6 play g6 + e5 e
5 play and e 5 + most of these new
phones include new 18:9 displays at 720p
or 1080p class resolutions the e series
of basic entry-level handsets with
Snapdragon 400 series SOC is another
basic hardware while the G Series gets
more features up to a snapdragon 830 SOC
and better cameras the e phones will
cost under $200 while the G models will
come in between 200 and 300 dollars it's
been a big week for us here at hardware
and box so that's it for news corner
