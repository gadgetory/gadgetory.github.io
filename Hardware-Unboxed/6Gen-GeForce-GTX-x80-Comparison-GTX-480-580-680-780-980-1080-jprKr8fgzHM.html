have pointed out my old family flagship
GTX 480 is sitting on the shelves behind
me just by being watch probably the
least impressive flagship product to
come from the Green Team in recent
memory many of us still seem to have
fond memories of the only graphics card
to double as a George Foreman grill
anyway having spotted the old fellow
many of you requested by bench market in
the latest games just for fun as
hilarious as it would be throwing 1.3
teraflops of processing power the latest
and greatest titles i've come up with a
slightly different idea that tastes that
idea and turns into a much more
interesting test since I have a
reference GTX for 85 86 87 89 80 and now
a 1080 why not do a comparison between
the various X 80 Series GPUs released
over the past six years well that's
exactly what I've done
Before we jump to the benchmarks let's
see how these various GPUs compare on
paper here we can see clearly just how
complex the GeForce architecture has
become over the past six years the X 80
series now features a little over five
times more CUDA cores when compared to
2010 s GTX 480 yet despite that the die
size is now 40% smaller and includes
more than twice as many transistors many
of you will no doubt be quick to point
out the $500 MSRP of the early GTX 480
580 and 680 graphics cards all of which
were the single GPU flagship models of
the time then Along Came the GTX 780 and
pricing got a bit out of control
thankfully AMD did eventually come to
the party with their world-beating
Radeon r9 290x and at $550 they forced
him video to re-evaluate pricing the
result was a new $500 MSRP for the GTX
780 the same asking price of the
previous X 80 models a year after the
GTX 780 price dropped the GTX 980 landed
and at $550 the release to MSRP again
crept up a little still given the extra
performance and improved efficiency most
took the $50 premium on the chin and got
on with it now with this year's release
of the Pascal based GT x 1080 we faced a
similar situation with no direct
competition inside Nvidia bumped the
MSRP by
50 dollars giving us what will
eventually be a $600 1080 again
performance and efficiency has been
improved in fact much more so than any
time the previous six years so how
easily can that extra fifty dollars over
the nine 80 or 100 dollars over the
older models be justified let's move on
to find out as usual the results have
been recorded using my GPU test system
built inside the corsair carbide 600 C
the processor of choice is the Intel
Core i7 6700 K clocked and locked at 4.5
gigahertz to try and avoid any CPU
bottlenecks although I have tested at
both 1080p in 1440p in an effort to keep
the video as short as possible I'll be
only discussing this 1440p results here
those interested in the 1080p data can
refer to the written review the link for
which will be provided in the video
description
first up me a battlefield forum here we
see a nice 71% performance gain from the
480 to the 680 skipping the 580 of
course then from the 680 to the 980 you
will see a smaller 44% margin however
from the 980 to the 1080 you would see a
huge 86% leap in performance for an
average frame rate of 110 fps this time
we see a 68% performance jump from the
980 to the 1080 of Star Wars Battlefront
at 1440p that's an impressive result
when you consider the fact that the 980
was 42% faster than the 780 which is 24%
faster than the 680 the GTX 480 averaged
just 20 fps in black ops 3
of course this GPU was never designed
with resolutions such as 1440p in mind
at least now when playing titles from
2015 onwards the 580 was 30% faster
while the 680 was just 15% faster again
the 780 provided a 20% boost in
performance though it was the 980 that
made a truly massive step here offering
an 83 percent performance increase it's
difficult to say if these gains are down
to the refine GPU architecture or a lack
of driver optimization for the 780 along
with the GPUs that came before it I
suspect it's a bit of both really the
driver is possibly playing a greater
role in this title
unlike black ops 3 we see a more even
playing field in Tom Clancy's the
division the GTX 1080 was 69% faster
than the 980 while the 980 was 36%
faster than the 787 and he led the 680
by a 32% margin and the 60d was also 32%
faster than the 580 which cry
the 480 by 46 percent margin we see some
pretty huge gains from the one
architecture to the next in Just Cause 3
and given the games history with AMD and
NVIDIA drivers we're going to put most
of these performance differences down
the driver optimization the fermi base
480 and 580 were extremely slow
38% slower than the GTX 680 in fact
although the 780 was 21% faster than the
sixth eighth year it was still 39%
slower than the GTX 980 finally the 1080
provided a nice 58 percent performance
boost over the 980 the performance of
the fermi based GPUs here looks very
primal they're just a few frames away
from throwing rocks the GTX 680 was 92
percent faster than the 580 while the
780 delivered a further 32 percent bump
in performance going from the 780 to the
980 net is 39 percent more performance
and finally from the 980 to the 1080 so
a 70 percent increase in performance
from the GTX 580 on we consistently saw
large performance games 82% when going
from the 580 to the 680 48% from the 680
to the 780 and 43% from the 780 to the
980 finally the 1080 provided a 67
percent performance boost over the 980
when testing with The Witcher 3 we see
very consistent gains from one GPU to
the next however the largest gains can
be seen when upgrading from the 480 to
the 580 here an 88% performance increase
the seem then from the 780 to the 980
Lanza's 52% more performance and finally
from the 1982 the 1080 s is a further 57
percent performance gain having now
looked at eight modern games let's take
a flashback to 2010 s Metro 2033 a game
released the same year as the GTX 480 M
580
testing at 1440 pcs the 580 averages 31
fps making it 19 percent faster than the
480 the 680 was 32 percent faster than
the 580 while the 680 was another 29%
faster the 980 was 28% faster than the
780 while the 1080 provided a further 56
percent performance boost over the 980
the power figures on screen are based on
entire system draw which includes not
just the graphics card but also my 6700
K test system as you can see the 480 was
a bit of a power Pig causing the system
to draw up to 291 watts under load the
580 allowed for a 10 watt reduction
while the new 1080
25% less power while delivering worlds
more performance in fact the 1080
consume just 7 watts more than the 980
now we know it to be around 60% faster
on average well that was an interesting
trip down memory lane it's hard to
believe that the ones king of the Nvidia
Hill looks so pathetic today I'm of
course talking about the GTX 480 and yes
I get that at 6 years old now but I can
recall some pretty impressive
performance back in the day when playing
games such as battlefield bad company 2
for example taking a look at the
performance across the nine games tested
we find some interesting results looking
back to 2010 when the GTX 580 was
released it was found to be 25 to 30
percent faster than the 480 at the time
those figures are in line with what we
found today using the latest drivers
testing with modern games the GTX 680
was also around 40 percent faster than
the 580 so that's again in line with
what we've found here meanwhile the 780
was around 25 to 30 percent faster than
the 680 and we found here was an average
29 percent faster now for the
interesting stat when the GTX 980 was
first introduced I believe was around 25
to 30 percent faster than the vanilla
GTX 780 in today's games we found that
the margins grown somewhat to a little
over 40% this comes down to the fact
that in today's games NVIDIA has been
heavily optimizing for Maxwell while
forgetting Kepler for the most part this
does however make the 67 percent
performance game for the Pascal based
1080 of the 980 all the more impressive
as history has shown us you can expect
this margin to grow slightly as in video
shifts focus towards Pascal for upcoming
titles just to be clear I'm not trying
to suggest that the new Pascal GDX 1080
is over 60 percent faster than the
Maxwell based GeForce 900 series the
titan axon in particular 980ti bridged
the gap between these two series and
with the 980ti costing just $50 more
when comparing MSRP s there isn't much
in it the 980ti overclocks much better -
so there's that to keep in mind as well
this was merely a comparison between
GeForce xad GPUs for the Titan X 980ti
and 1080 comparison please check out my
main 1080 and 1070 video where I compare
all these graphics cards in over 20
games thanks for joining me again
we're boxed I'm your host Matt as always
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
