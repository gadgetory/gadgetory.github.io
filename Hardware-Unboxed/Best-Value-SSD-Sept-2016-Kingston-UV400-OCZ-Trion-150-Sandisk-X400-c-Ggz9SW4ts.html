soon or maybe just upgrading the one you
have if you are then there's a good
chance most of your focus will be
directed towards the CPU and GPU of
course these are important components
that deserve your attention but don't
overlook storage I'm often surprised by
viewers to share their build plans with
me not because the build itself is bad
but rather it neglects what I believe is
the most essential component of any
modern PC a solid-state drive yes yes I
know SSDs don't equal more frames per
second than if all you do is game then
they aren't final still for what's now a
relatively small price they
significantly improve the PC experience
with those glorious 0 millisecond access
times having now used necess d for a
number of years myself going back to
mechanical drive isn't an option
thankfully no one needs to bother
themselves with the grinding soundtrack
of a spinning disk anymore at least not
for their primary drive anyway SSD
pricing has improved tremendously over
the past few years and this is mostly
due to fierce competition in the
marketplace oddly though it's created
yet another problem for would-be buyers
with so many seemingly affordable SSDs
on offer which one should you buy well
I've spent the last few days researching
that very question luckily I have access
to almost all modern SSDs so I'm able to
give you my first-hand opinion so with
that let's make some picks for this
video I'm just selecting a few
two-and-a-half inch SATA SSDs that I
feel give the best bang for your buck
for higher end two and a half inch and
m2 SSDs I'll create a follow-up video
soon my selections will take things such
as cost per gigabyte performance power
consumption features and warranty into
account at the top of my SSD buying list
is the new kingston SSD now UV 400
performance-wise the series deliver
speeds of up to 550 megabytes per second
read and 500 megabytes right along with
great endurance figures of course this
is a TLC dryer but that's to be expected
at this price the price being just 60 US
dollars for the 240 gigabyte model or
110 US dollars for the 480 gigabyte
model down under pricing is just as
impressive our sales user pain just
$85 for the 240 gig bottle or $50 for
the 120 gigabyte model in an effort to
suite
the deal Kingstown are also backing
these dryers with a three year warranty
you so that's good for peace of mind if
you can't afford it
I recommend the 240 gigabyte model as
it's considerably better value than the
smaller 120 gigabyte model price of just
25 US cents per gigabyte it's hard to
beat what do you V 400 offers right now
that said coming close is a drive that I
initially recommended viewers avoid at
least until reliability was proven now
over eight months later the OCZ try on
150 is proving to be a huge improvement
over the previous version the 240
gigabyte model which is again the best
value option cost us 65 US dollars or 90
ozzie performance wise it's also much
the same and again uses TLC NAND flash
memory coupled with a decent endurance
rating
OC said we're now invited to Shiba seem
to have cleaned up their act and offer
this affordable model with a three year
warranty the king of the TLC hills the
SanDisk X 400 offering greater
performance than both the Kingston and
no Caesar drives it's also backed by a
five-year warranty
unfortunately the smaller 128 gigabyte
model in 256 gigabyte models and
cost-effective the 256 gig model is
priced at 80 US or 125 ozzie for example
that said if you're after a 512 Google
one terabyte model then the X 400 does
emerge is one of the better options and
if these capacities I do recommend it
over the other TLC based drives finally
for those of you that don't like TLC
drives the best value mlc option right
now is myshkin's reactor series the 256
cubic model is priced at 80 us though be
aware these don't seem to be available
in Australia for my faller was ease the
SanDisk plus is exceptional value at $90
for the 240 gig model or 160 for the 480
gigabyte model the same 3 year warranty
applies though so be aware of that
there's certainly some great
cost-effective SSD options available now
and I see no reason why any PC
enthusiasts wouldn't be running one in
their system on a final note I will say
that while an SSD is great for
dramatically improving OS boot times
application load times and increasing
the general snappiness of a PC you don't
need to spend big the low cost options
listed in this video will be
indistinguishable for the average user
when compared to an extreme m2 nvme
Drive for example - keep that in mind
have you
the switchover to an SSD let me know in
the comments I'm your host Matt as
always and I'll see you guys next time
cheers guys for joining me for another
episode of hardware unbox so those of
you that already support the channel
thank you so much it's truly appreciated
and to those of you that would like to
support the channel directly I do have
Amazon links and a patreon link in the
video description below thanks a lot and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
