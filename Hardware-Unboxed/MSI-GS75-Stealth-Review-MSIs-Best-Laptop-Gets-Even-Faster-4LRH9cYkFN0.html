checking out the msi gs70 5 stealth 8
sg-1 of a number of new r-tx powered
gaming laptops from msi as this beast
fits into their stealth phone is
designed to be a slim and light portable
gaming system with Gio 75 branding
indicating it's fair 17-inch model
previously I reviewed the GS 65 and
really liked it so I was definitely keen
to check out the large model equipped
with a new RT X GPU MSI has a number of
GS 75 models on the market each with
different suffixes I'm checking out the
8 SG model here which is the highest end
unit equipped with an NVIDIA GeForce
r-tx 2080 max-q GPU there are also
models available with the RT X 2070 max
Q and the RT X 2060 each variant of this
laptop with a different GPU is then
available with different RAM and storage
configurations in my case I received 32
gigabytes of dual channel memory and a
dual 512 gigabyte SSD setup in raid 0
the rest of the hardware is the same
among the configurations you get an
Intel Core i7
8750 H processor the standard for gaming
laptops there's also a 17.3 inch 1080p
144 Hertz IPS level display and an 82
watt hour battery the design of the new
GS 75 is pretty much unchanged from
MSI's previous versions and that's a
good thing it means we're still getting
the excellent metal new unibody built
with beautiful copper gold highlights
this really is one of the best-looking
gaming laptops on the market so
wholesale changes really aren't required
it's a sleek laptop with a nice
minimalist style we're still getting
Emma sized version of a slim bezel
laptop even at 17 inches with the tiny
webcam positioned above the display it's
not the slimmest bezels available on any
laptop but it certainly feels like the
display is taking up most of the room
available to it and it keeps the laptop
compact overall in fact it just 19
millimeters thick and 2.25 kilograms
heavy it's a very portable chassis for a
17 inch Beast come in slimmer and
lighter than your typical 15-inch system
the keyboard used here is the same
SteelSeries unit as previous msi laptops
personally it's not one of my favorites
the tactile response is spongy and not
particularly satisfying although a
travel distance is fine it does come
with a full numpad as I'd expect for a
17 inch laptop although the inclusion of
full-size arrow case has truncated the
right shift key which may annoy some
users the good news is you do get perky
RGB backlighting which is becoming more
widespread among high-end gaming laptops
you also get a sizable trackpad with
excellent responsiveness IO is the usual
affair here 3 USB 3.1 gen2 type-c ports
two USB seaports one is Thunderbolt 3
and the other USB 3.1 gen2 on there's
Ethernet a micro SD card slot and HDMI
as well as dual 3.5 mill or your jacks
my only concern here is the amount of
ports on the right side of the laptop
such as HDMI which makes it a little
awkward to have a mouse there several
things that are plugged in let's talk
about performance now and as a quick
reminder everything he is based on my
experience with the RT X 28 Emacs qmo
with that said I do have comprehensive
benchmark reviews of the RT X 2070 max Q
+ RT X 2060 that should apply to this
laptops other GPU configurations as with
many gaming laptops there are several
performance modes and fan profiles to
choose from
throughout this review I found the top
turbo performance mode to perform the
best because it overclocks the GPU by
100 megahertz compared to the default
sport mode I also found that while there
are 4 fan modes the auto mode performs
just as well as the other performance
oriented modes with very little change
in fan speeds while gaming this is great
to see because auto also quietens the
fans significantly during less intensive
tasks like web browsing throughout this
review i've used the combination of the
turbo mode and auto fan mode the laptop
comes with one of intel 6 core core a
78758 processors which is widely used
across gaming laptops particularly in
this form factor I've dusted the CPU
many times before so I'm not going to
rehash a ton of benchmarks for this
laptop in particular if you're
interested go back and check out my
original review of this mobile CPU in
terms of CPU performance all I'm looking
for here is to see whether the msi gs70
v stealth performs especially well or
especially poorly compared to the
average results from all the core 78758
laptops we've tested so far it
depend on the workload but the Geo 75 is
a little slower on average especially in
longer workloads like handbrake and x264
encoding where it's about 6% behind with
that said it's a little faster in
shorter tasks like 7-zip in MATLAB so
this isn't a bad result overall it just
can't sustain as high performance for as
long as some of the beefier laptops
we've tested if you are coming from a
quad-core laptop something using a core
i7 7700 HQ for example you can expect
the GS 75 to deliver pretty sizable
gains 40% in workloads like x2 64
encoding and over 50% in 7-zip with the
handy 10% improvement in single threaded
tasks as well chopping up to 6 cores is
a good move especially if you have a lot
of multi-threaded work and it can help
alleviate a few bottlenecks in some
games I'm sure most of you watching this
review will be more interested in gaming
performance though given this that's me
the key selling point of getting a unit
with a GPU as fast as the r-tx 2018 max
cube if you're after a detailed
performance breakdown of this GPU please
check out my full review that focuses on
the RT x 2080 max Q we will see some
individual game breakdowns and
discussion it's safe to say this GPU is
very capable of gaming at 1080p at high
frame rates which makes use of the
laptops 144 Hertz display the key thing
to note here is the GS 75 stealth uses
the regular 80 watt configuration of the
RT x 28mm XQ not the faster 90 watt
version so the data to look at in my
past review is for this standard
configuration but that data only refers
to how this laptop performs in a default
sport performance mode if you enable the
turbo mode the GPU gets a 100 megahertz
factory overclock of sorts which
improves performance over the standard
RT X 20 80 max Q configuration I'm sure
most gamers will want the best
performance straight away so this
factory OC mode is something you should
use to get the most out of the laptop as
far as thermals and noise are concerned
the Tobler mode didn't impact either
significantly so I don't see a reason
not to use it for gaming the best reason
to use the turbo mode is it improves
gaming performance by 3% on average it's
not enough to get the r-tx 20 80 max Q
in its standard any wot config to reach
the performance levels of the 90 watt
version but it's a handy boost over
stock performance that you can easily
access
with a single click and depending on the
game you play you could see up to a 10%
improvement which is pretty impressive
how does this turbo performance stack up
to other GPUs well let's take a look as
I mentioned we're sitting about 3%
behind the 90 watt configuration of the
architect's 20 80 max Q not a massive
gap the laptops that do include the
higher TDP variant deliver better
performance unfortunately there's no
easy way to tell which laptops are 90
watt models thanks Nvidia for that one
we're getting 12% more performance from
the GS 75 then a standard RT X 2070 max
Q laptop without any factory
overclocking some games are heavily
constrained by the CPU or other hardware
like hitman 2 while other games such as
Metro Exodus deliver 17% more
performance you're not getting desktop
like margins here but low double-digit
gains from the same cooler design
certainly isn't bad how does 27% more
performance than the gtx 1070 max q
sound that's again a very healthy
improvement that's assisted by the small
factory overclock provided by the GS 75
we're not comparing the same price
bracket here but I suspect some people
with the gtx 1070 mask you up top might
be considering spending a bit more cash
on their next upgrade you also get 18%
more performance than an RT ex 2060
laptop this is another GPU that's
available in the msi gs70 5 so which GPU
is best might come down to the pricing
you can get for each of variants the ITX
2080 max q is a decent amount faster
though and finally a comparison to the
pascal gtx 1070 for laptops which wasn't
usually found in laptops of this size
and weight but still is irrelevant in
comparison the RT x 2080 max q is only
providing 9% more performance on average
and doesn't win in every title though in
some titles it is significantly faster
it's not a bad upgrade but it's not near
the performance gain you can expect
moving from a desktop gtx 1070 to a
desktop RTX 2018 MSI's current
generation triple fan cooling solution
is very good it's definitely one of the
better designs I've seen for this sort
of portable gaming system even when
using the overclock turbo mode the GS 75
is quieter than your average gaming
laptop at 45 dB
hey and it does this while keeping the
GPU around 75 degrees Celsius which is
cooling performance you'd normally
expect from a chunkier laptop life
roj Strix ska - not a swim system like
this in fact the GS 75 is significantly
better in this regard than the GS 65
with the GTX 1070 max Q although it is
slightly louder it's also a larger
system so there's more room for heat
dissipation and the GPU is different
more impressively it's quieter and
cooler than the gigabyte era 15 X 9
which uses the slower
RTX 2070 max Q however this does come at
the cost of CPU cooling which is right
at its limit hitting 91 degrees Celsius
under a gaming load so there's really
not much room to move on CPU
temperatures surface temperatures as
well were manageable the laptop gets
quite hot above the keyboard where there
is some ventilation
however the keyboard area and wrist
rests were comfortable to use during an
extended gaming session just make sure
you don't place anything that melts
around the back or sides of this laptop
because the extensive venting holes do
push out a fair volume of hot air
looking at storage performance the GS 75
I received with one terabyte of SSD
space was configured with two samsung
PCIe nvme drives in raid 0 so naturally
it delivered extremely good sequential
speeds random performances at the limit
of these drives but it's still excellent
for a gaming laptop and it's safe to say
this SSD is much faster than what you
need for game loading when removing the
bottom cover you get easy access to the
2 loaded SSDs as well as an additional
third MDOT 2 slot which was free in my
unit so there's further room to upgrade
the storage in the future this is also a
better internal design than the last gen
GS 65 I looked at which had no access to
storage without further deconstruction
however there are a few disappointing
aspects the internal layout here because
MSI is still using a flip motherboard
you can't access the RAM without taking
the entire motherboard out which is
tricky and time-consuming
hopefully the morals that come with 16
gigabytes of RAM included in a dual
channel configuration for the best
performance because if it's single
channel it will be hard to fix there's
also no 2.5 inch drive base you're stuck
with just MDOT 2 slots for storage
upgrades perhaps not the biggest deal
given this is a high-end laptop and
there's a generous three and got two
slots but it would have been nice given
this is a 17 inch notebook
batch life is pretty good from the 82
watt hour battery despite the use of a
17 inch high refresh display in our
video playback test it performed around
the same
mark as other 15-inch laptops of this
size which I'd say is a good result the
display used here is also very good
it's 17.3 inches in size if that's a
1080p resolution and it has a 144 Hertz
refresh rate you don't get adaptive sync
which is a trade-off to allow better
battery life through GPU switching but
the quality of this panel is great and
the high refresh rate is a perfect poem
for this GPU that often pushes frame
rates above 100 FPS at 1080p with ultra
settings brightness is very good at over
400 nits while the contrast ratio of
1000:1
is typical for a laptop IPS and because
it's like PS you get great viewing
angles with acceptable response times
but what I feel is the best aspect of
this display is Emma sized color
calibration when using the srgb mode
available through msi true color you're
getting an accurate white point around
6500 K plus strong Delta II averages in
our saturation and color checker tests
where the display falls under 2.0 it's
not perfect you do a grayscale Delta II
average a little above 2.0 but otherwise
this is an excellent result for a gaming
laptop display overall the gr 75 stealth
8 SG is another excellent portable
gaming laptop from MSI there's not a lot
to complain about in regards to the
hardware package I absolutely love the
metal chassis the 15 inch display is
very good it's cooler and quieter than
an average gaming laptop despite the
size and powerful hardware inside and
there's good IO
it's even better from a performance
perspective sure I have criticized the
ITX 28 Emacs Q for a number of issues
like the naming confusion how it stacks
up the desktop parts and so on but
purely looking at its standalone
performance it's impressive when it can
do in this sort of form factor it's
great for 1080 P high refresh gaming and
very solid for higher resolutions using
external displays in the latest games
ultra settings the choir 78758 is also
perfect for productivity tasks on the go
like video editing right now this is the
fastest Hardware you can get in this
form factor most of my criticisms of
this laptop feel like minor nitpicks
relative to the overall quality of the
system the keyboard is a little spongy
the IO layout isn't the best and the
8750 H is a little slower than average
in longer workloads
but overall looking at just the hardware
there's no doubt this is a great gaming
laptop and one that I could recommend
unfortunately this hardware
comes at a price and it's a high one to
get top-end performance in this size
you're going to need to fork out $2,800
and that's just for the chair 75 with a
256 gig SSD and 16 gigabytes of RAM for
the configuration
I reviewed with one terabyte of SSD
space and 32 gig of ram you're looking
at more like three thousand US dollars
or a huge 4,800 ozzie it's really hard
to justify spending that sort of money
on the r-tx 20 80 max cube because
you're paying a massive premium to get
this flagship level performance the ITX
20 70 max cube version of this laptop is
four hundred dollars cheaper meaning it
delivers about 10 percent less
performance for a 14% lower price the
ITX 360 model is even better relative
value at $2,100 so 25 percent cheaper
for 14 percent less performance of the
current generation
artex GPUs there's no doubting the r-tx
2060 is the best value but at the same
time price premiums for the best
hardware are commonplace whether
spending an extra $700 is worth it to
get 10 to 20 fps more will be up to you
and your budget the value situation is
further muddied by Pascal laptops which
admittedly are getting harder to find a
stock clears out right now you can get a
gtx 1070 max Q system like the seuss ROG
Zephyrus s for around $1,800 which is
slightly better value than the RT X 2060
GSF I've given the tensor v-max q is
also slower than that GPU it's an
interesting market because for regular
laptops so not the slim and light
variants we've been talking about so far
I wouldn't recommend a more expensive RT
x 2060 laptop over a cheaper gtx 1070
laptop right now but for slim and light
systems the gtx 1070 max q and r TX 2060
are fairly priced given their
performance differences what is the
better option we'll be down to your
budget personally I would pick the newer
RT x 360 gr 75 because I love this MSI
design and it's 17 inches and it does
end up performing better and you know
what they say bigger is better
the final consideration to make is
whether you really need the slim and
light capabilities of this laptop you
can save two to $300 opting for a
regular size system like the msi ge70 5
or the ROG Strix hero 2
for the same artex 2016 performance and
that saving only increases as you jump
up performance tears if design and
weight are super important to you the GS
75 is a great option otherwise a regular
mid tier system might be a better choice
that's it for this review of the msi
gs70 5 a really solid system if you
choose the r-tx 2060 model and a less
good value choice if you want the artex
2080 max q subscribe for more laptop
