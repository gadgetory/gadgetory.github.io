final installment of why building a
gaming PC right now is a bad idea in
part one we looked at ddr4 memory
discuss pricing and availability and
speculated as to when would be builders
can expect prices to fall then in part
two we did a very similar thing but the
focus there was on graphics cards those
were the big ones for sure memory and
graphics cards SSD pricing that crept up
a little bit in late 2017 but nothing
really worth talking about
unless of course I've missed something
as it stands right now quality one
terabyte SSD such as the crucial MX 500
will set you back just 25 cents per
gigabyte and that's about as low as I've
seen prices get so I'm not going to bang
on about SSD prices they really aren't
increasing the barrier of entry for
gamers that being the case with ddr4 and
graphics cards already covered what
other hurdles might game is hoping to
upgrade or even build a new PC face well
it's my opinion that even if graphics
cards and memory modules were retailing
for the suggested retail prices let's
say that's still a good time to build or
even upgrade your PC right now we're at
the end of quite a few product cycles
within three months from now AMD is set
to release their second generation rise
and sea views and what we're not
expecting huge performance improvements
there we are hoping for at least a 10%
performance improvement as well as an
increase in performance per watt
couple that with the upcoming 400 series
AMD motherboards which we're still not
100% sure what's going to be on offer
there but it means for those buying a
rise in CPU and a 300 series motherboard
right now you should really only do that
if you can't possibly wait a few more
months it's also quite possible once
these second generation rising CPUs
arrive at existing rising CPUs and
motherboards might go on sale so there
could be some good bargains to be had
for budget gamers next month's arrival
of Raven Ridge the desktop AVP use
should also be very exciting and well
worth waiting for the horizon 520 400 G
for example that could quite possibly
eliminate the need for an entry-level
discrete graphics card with its Vega 11
integrator
graphics then on the other side of the
fence we have Intel and they're still
yet to be fully released coffee-like
series namely the supporting chipsets
as it stands the 8th gen core processors
can only be paired with a Zed 370
motherboard no start at about 110
dollars u.s. from budget shoppers this
doesn't really make that much sense and
it almost eliminates the otherwise great
value core i3 8100 we know motherboard
makers are preparing B 360 H 310 and H
370 motherboards and they should become
available shortly and again these will
be far better value options for budget
shoppers on the flip side high-end Intel
shoppers might also want to hold fire on
that core i7 87 arcade purchase as
updated ded 390 motherboards will also
be arriving shortly
rumor has it these boards will be
required to support the upcoming
eight-course 16 thread coffee-like CPUs
moving on from CPUs and motherboards
we're also expecting new GPUs soon at
least from Nvidia anyway and with AMD
probably to act later in the year the
Pascal based GeForce 10 series that was
released back in May of 2016 so it
really wouldn't surprise me if we see
the next generation series take to
shelves in May of this year but that's
purely speculation on my behalf
though we do know Nvidia is preparing to
launch the new series soon and this is
another contributing factor to why they
won't want to increase the production of
Pascal at the moment so in three to four
months you could have your choice of new
CPUs motherboards and graphics cards of
course if you're desperate for an
upgrade right now and you can't wait or
then you can't wait but if you can wait
then it seems quite clear that doing so
would be the wise choice
as a bit of a side note there is
something else that could threaten PC
component prices this year and that is a
shortage of copper foil and this could
lead to a PCB shortage the price of
copper increased by 25 percent during
2017 and while there is still plenty of
copper about there is a looming shortage
in copper foil production capacity
eating up a good chunk of copper foil
production our lithium batteries used by
electric cars current reports state that
demand is continuing to increase while
global output
and compounding the potential issue here
is the fact that China is planning to
ban of the importation of electric waste
and that is a significant source of
recycled copper it's no doubt that other
countries will eventually pick up the
slack but in the meantime this could
lead to a decrease in copper supply so
there's no telling when graphics card
pricing and availability will balance
out ddr4 probably won't settle down
until ddr5 takes over and now there's
the possibility that everything could
become a little more expensive in 2018
2017 we take it back you weren't all
that bad
of course this potential issue might not
become a real issue at all and maybe in
a few months time you'll see a new
series called why building a gaming PC
right now is a great idea fingers
crossed I suppose on a final note you
can almost always say it's better to
wait than buy now but that isn't always
necessarily true and after all at some
point you actually do have to pull the
trigger if you ever want to own a gaming
PC so it really is up to you guys to do
your research and work out if it makes
sense for you to build your system at
any given time right now though we are
very deep into the product cycles and as
we've noted there are a few other
reasons why we think building or
upgrading a PC right now just isn't a
good time so I'm gonna leave it on that
I hope you guys enjoyed the video and
this series that we've put together I'm
your host Steve see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
