have our first g-force our TX 2070
review for you and I suspect like most
reviewers we were seriously under the
pump for this one I haven't slept for a
while now so I'm very tired I'm sure I
look tired but yeah just hoping to get
through this one as efficiently as
possible for whatever reason Nvidia
thought it was a good idea to hold off
sending out review samples until just a
few days before the release so that
being the case I'm not expecting my r-tx
2070 founders edition graphics card
until later this week probably Friday
thankfully MSI did come through for us
and save the day last minute we
literally haven't had a minute to spare
on this one I've had around 30 hours in
total and I really have used every last
minute to create this content
unfortunately a few hours were wasted on
an unbelievable issue with the flagship
model the gaming Zed card yeah very odd
issue with this card so right now we
aren't on the best of terms
so you wasted a bit of time with this
one but I'll talk about that towards the
end of the video I feel like we should
probably get towards at the benchmark
data as quick as possible
thankfully MSI did also provide their
armor version so we've got two cards
from MSI and they say that this armor
version will come in closer to the MSRP
but I'll believe that when I see it and
that's not necessarily a dig at MSI but
rather in videos mythical suggested
retail prices let's say on paper the
r-tx 27 he claims a $500 u.s. MSRP for
the board partner cards such as the
armor that is the suggested price for
this card but as I said we'll see what
happens
when they go on sale shortly then
there's also the much less attractive
$600 u.s. price for the Nvidia
foundation model and that's also what I
believe the price will be for the gaming
Zed card so for most of the aib models
the entry-level ones we are
expecting a 30% decrease in price being
compared to the r-tx 2080 models and
they have about a 33% decrease in Krita
cause it video zone review guide shows
the r-tx 2070 easily beating the gtx
1070 and then the 970 that came before
it though that is a little misleading as
it is priced to compete with the gtx
1080 and vega 64 so not the gtx 1070 so
anyway the gtx 1080 and vega 64 will be
the models that i focus our attention on
when comparing these are TX 2070 models
so for all the testing I'm using the msi
r-tx 2070 armor and it will be compared
to the efi versions of the 2080 TI and
2080 along with the MSI gaming X
versions of the 1080 1080 TI and 1070 as
well as the gaming extra o 1080 to I
then we have the asou Strix Vega 64 and
Vega 56 models along with AMD's Vega 64
liquid as usual I'm using our course a
GPU test system inside the crystal
series 570 X with the core i7 87 RK
clocked at five-year Hertz and 32
gigabytes of vengeance ddr4 3400 memory
for the AMD GPUs I've used Radeon
adrenaline driver 18 point 10.1 and for
NVIDIA GeForce for 11.6 t3 while the
r-tx 2017 GP will be using Java version
for 16.3 3 in total we have the results
for 20 games but due to limited time I'm
going to discuss the results of just 6
of them and they will be six of the more
newly-released titles and then I'll
break down the data for all the games at
the end of the video I'll also include
all 61 graphs over on our patreon page
so feel free to check those out the link
will be in the video description if you
want to go and have a look at any of the
results a little more closely anyway
that's pretty much everything we need to
talk about let's get into the results
first up we have Far Cry 5 and let's
start with the 1080p results here the
r-tx 2070 was a whisker slower than the
GTX 1080
but it was also just 9% slower than the
r-tx 28 even when comparing the average
framerate that said we are mostly CPU
bound at this resolution at 1440p the
GTX 1080
x27 he can be seen delivering basically
the same performance this means the 2070
is now 21% slower than the r-tx 2080
then at the 4k resolution we see the
2070 and 1080 delivering identical frame
rates making them 23% slower than the
2080 this time when testing with
Assassin's Creed Odyssey we do see the
RT X 2070 providing a reasonable
performance advantage over the 1080 at
1080p it was 8% faster on average so
another bad result they're not exactly
mind-blowing stuff given the price and
we will discuss that more towards the
end of the video the margins extended
out to 13% 1440p and now the 2070 is
found in the middle of the 1080 and
1080i making it just 14% slower than the
RT x 2080 again at 4k the 27 t finds
itself between the 1080 and 1080i which
means it was just 13% slower for the
2080 so a reasonably impressive result
here I suppose
moving on to Forza horizon 4 and here
the 2070 is only just able to keep pace
with the 1080 and overall performance
seems quite lackluster despite pushing
higher frame rates at 1080p much the
same as seen at 1440p the 2070 comes in
a few frames behind the GTX 1080 for a
pretty disappointing result has to be
said the RT X 2070 isn't able to do any
better at the 4k resolution either as
it's only able to match the 1080 here
and that minute was 25% slower than the
GTX 1080 Ti and RT X 2080 testing with
shadow of the Tomb Raider sees the RT X
2070 again delivered GT X 1080 lat
performance that was at least a few
frames faster in this title at 1080p
moving to 1440p and here we see that the
2070 is just 3 FPS faster than the 1080
on average better than 3 FPS slower I
guess finally at 4k we see similar
performance from the 2070 and 1080 once
again
this meant the 2070 was 24% slower than
the 2080 next up we have strange Brigade
and here the 2070 provided a nice little
7% performance boost over the 1080 at
1080p
then at 1440p we see a slightly larger
10% margin in favor of the RT X 2070 and
this pushed at ahead of Vega 64 while it
was
us behind Vegas 64 liquid so overall a
nice result here moving to 4k brings
things back a bit now we're seeing just
a 6% margin of the 2070 average
fifty-six FPS while the 1080 was good
453 fps
this meant the 2070 also fell back
behind the Vegas 64 GPUs interestingly
monster hunter world is another title
like Assassin's Creed Odyssey where the
r-tx 2070 pulls its finger out and
actually delivers some reasonably
exciting numbers here it was 9% fast in
the GTX to 1080 which is a decent
performance uplift it was also 22% solid
in the r-tx 2080 this continued at 1440p
or rather improved as the 2070 is now
11% faster than the 1080 and 21% slower
than the 2080 things get pulled back a
little at 4k but even so the 27 he still
provided 7% more frames and the 1080
though it is now 24% slower than the
r-tx 2080
when it comes to power consumption the
r-tx 2070 is slightly more efficient in
the GTX 1080
pushing total system consumption to 319
watts
this meant total system consumption was
reduced by 16 percent when compared to
the 2080 and 5 percent compared to the
1080 now for temperatures we saw a peak
of 65 degrees with the MSI r-tx 2070
with an ambient room temperature of 21
degrees so very respectable given that
the dual fans are only spinning at 1300
rpm this means the armor is a very cool
and quiet entry-level model from MSI I
should note that south of 60 degrees the
fans on this model don't spin at all so
for normal operation it is completely
silent ok so a few mixed results but it
seemed as though for the most part the
GeForce r-tx 2070 was delivering GT X
1080 UI performance which is pretty much
what we were expecting to find that said
let's see how the 2070 compared to not
just the 1080 but also the 2080 1070 and
Vega 64 across a 20 game sample here's a
look at how the r-tx 2070 compares to
the GTX 1080 at 1440p
as we expected it is a close battle with
the 27 t winning by just a 7% margin on
average the only big wins for the 2070
came in Wolfenstein 2 and dirt 4 while
in project cars to Forza horizon for and
for honor while up to 20% gains are nice
to see sadly at this stage these are
outlier results and as the 7% average
figure suggests single digit gains are
what you can typically expect to find
when compared to the more expensive RDX
2080s the new 2070 model was on average
18 percent slower at 1440p which is
about what you'd expect from a GPU with
33% fewer CUDA cores especially with a
few CPU limited results added to the
equation like what we see in war thunder
and prey for example we did see up to a
28% performance deficit in Ferrara and
25% and Forza horizon for but as you can
see for the most part the 2070 was
around 16 to 22 percent slower for gtx
1070 owners the jump in performance is
decent but really nothing new if you've
been holding out on getting a GTX 1080
for the past two years well you'll still
be holding out on average the r-tx 2070
was 27% faster but again for gtx 1070
and as that margin will fail to impress
given the price tag then we have the
Vegas 64 comparison and here the RT X
2070 was 10% faster on average so not
much more really say here in terms of
performance the GeForce r-tx 2070 yeah
it's as lackluster as we're expecting to
be honest
given what we saw with the 2080 we
predicted the 2070 would be around 10%
faster than the GTX 1080 and it turns
out we were pretty much on the money
with that one as we saw a 7 percent
improvement over the 20 games tested had
the MSRP been around $400 we'd be a lot
more excited about the numbers just seen
claiming the RT X 2070 as the new value
king but at $500 u.s. that's basically a
gtx 10a you refresh with a few extra
bells and whistles but at the moment you
can't really take advantage of those so
yeah for now they don't amount to too
much right now you can pick up a GTX
1080 frozen loss 450 dollars u.s. and
getting one for under $500 isn't
particularly difficult I'm also seeing
in gtx 1070 TI models for as low as $400
u.s. and there's plenty of models as
had $430 us and well we know if your
overclock those you're looking at GT X
1080 light performance which means that
an overclocked GTX 1072 I won't be much
slower than what we've seen here from
the RT X 2070 unfortunately right now we
don't yet fully know what the RT X 2070
graphics cards will retail for when they
hit shelves tomorrow and what we do know
though is that you can pre-order the
found Edition model from Nvidia for $600
and there is a single AIB model up for
sale on you egg and that's a gigabyte
card which is also selling for $600 so
will we see any models for as low as
$500 us the actual AIB MSRP well before
pondering that one for too long let's
look at a few cost per frame graphs
looking at the MSRP figures and yes we
know these are real prices for the most
part anymore because in video is abusing
the hell out of the MSRP but let's just
look at them anyway just in case we see
some pricing justice over the next few
months at the MSRP we see that the AIB
price for the r-tx 2070 sees it off
around 6% more value than the gtx 1080
that said when compared to vega 56 and
the gtx 1070 gets slightly worse in
terms of value despite being outright
faster it's also around 13% more cost
effective than the RDX 2080
that said pay close attention to the efi
MSRP as that sees the RCX 2070 come in
at a cost of six dollars and twelve
cents per frame and that makes it 13%
more expensive in the GTX 1080
again keep that in mind as we move on ok
so here are the more true-to-life
numbers and I'm going to ignore these
founders or some pricing here because in
reality fe and AI be pricing pretty much
the same thing here we see that in
reality the RT x 2070 is likely going to
cost around six dollars per frame based
on our data and that makes it worse
value than the gtx 1080i and even make
64 this right here is why we've been
less than excited about the new geforce
20 series at the AIB MSRP they're just
okay at the real MSRP though there are
pass not sure what more I can really say
at this point it really comes down to
the price and I'm expecting gamers will
have to pay around $600 us for an RT X
2070 graphics card which makes it a very
very average product even with any well
even with a lack of real competition
from AMD it's still quite lackluster and
in my opinion an exciting at the
expected prices meanwhile over in my
neck of the woods which is Australia
today I've been told by a few different
retailers that we can expect the
absolute cheapest models to cost about
950 dollars so yeah that's not great and
they also suggest that most models will
be priced closer to $1,000 some even
creeping over $1000 and that means even
the absolute cheapest cards will cost at
least 12% more than the current GT X
1080 models some retailers did suggest
that they're starting to see price
increase for the Pascal graphics cards
are slowly pulling them more in line
with the newer competing churring
graphics cards and this is something we
predicted would happen last month when
reviewing the RT x 2080 and 2080 TI the
cash grabs in full swing now people we
knew what the latest GeForce 20 series
was all about before it even hit shelves
so while disappointing we've known this
would be the situation for months now on
a more personal note I was very
disappointed that in-video chose to
shaft harbor unboxed on this release and
it sounds like and we weren't the only
media outlet getting shaft with this RT
x 2070 launch Nvidia failed to provide
us with an RT X 2070 sample there's no
reason why they couldn't and why they
shouldn't have we really should have had
one in our hands a week in advance
there's no reason why the cards weren't
ready and yet couldn't be in our hands
with a reasonable amount of time ahead
this release so we can take our time and
really put together a good review anyway
hopefully this content hasn't appeared
too rushed despite the fact that it was
quite rushed yeah
very disappointed that we had to rely on
MSI come
through less than well just over a day
before the review is set to go live
anyway I will have my foundation
graphics card in the next few days I
won't be doing any content with that
though I will test it for thermals power
consumption and some baseline numbers
just so I do have some baseline figures
to compare to cards such as these and
then I'll ship it off to Tim and then
he'll put it in his test beds and use it
for game optimization guides and
whatever else Tim feels like doing with
it oh and I should also note making the
deadline a little more challenging was
MSI's r-tx gaming head model I did touch
on this at the start of the video but I
didn't want to go into too many details
because I knew you guys would probably
just want to see the results
but yeah ran into a really really
strange issue with this card but
whatever reason it refused to boot up
with pcie 3.0 x 16 enabled so it was
defaulting to x 4 which was severely
limiting the bandwidth the card had
access to via the PCI Express slot and
that caused me to waste a lot of time
because I didn't know that was the
problem initially I just couldn't work
out what was going on the first few
hours I was stumped by the odd
performance I was seeing titles that
weren't particularly sensitive to the
nerfing of the PCI Express bandwidth by
performing reasonably well like what you
saw in the video 5 7% maybe up to 10%
faster than the GTX 1080 which is about
what I was expecting us that seemed
right then in other games it was like
20% slower so I knew that probably
wasn't right and yes so I spent a lot of
time trying to work out what was going
on there tried different test system
still the same thing in a different test
system with a different motherboard mind
you fresh install of Windows fresh
drivers wasted many hours as you can
imagine and then I noticed in GPU Z when
I was checking things like the drivers
and what the GPU was clocked at the
memory lot sort of stuff I noticed that
the PCIe spec wasn't quite right
sometimes that happens in GPUs II
thought I might have been a bug it's a
new card but then ultimately I did end
up digging this card out because I've
given up on this one I should have
really slowed this one in earlier but I
thought it
really
be the card I mean the gold pins are all
really clean they look nice the cards
brand-new I believe it's been tested by
MSI anyway put the armor in and
straightaway reported has PCI Express
3.0 x 16 and performance was restored in
the games or it was much lower to where
I was expecting it to be so then I madly
got on with testing this for the next 10
12 hours I don't really recall like I
said I haven't really slept I know now
we're done anyway to wrap this thing up
as you probably guessed I'm not
particularly impressed with the GeForce
RCX 2070 pricing which is a shame
because well apart from the issues I
have with this one it is a really nice
looking card I was super impressed with
this card especially if you can get it
in close to the MSRP because the
performance was excellent
it ran cool and quiet so yeah they're
some really great looking car tee from
MSI they have quite a few other
different models as well but we've got
two of them here as you've seen and yeah
it's a real shame that we're not
terribly excited about these new
graphics cards because a lot of the lot
of invidious partners look like they've
put together some really nice-looking
cards having said all that let me know
what you guys think have I been a bit
too harsh on the r-tx 2070 have I not
been harsh enough I don't know let me
know whether I've got it right or wrong
in the comment section below
oh and finally before I forget I haven't
talked about rate racing or D LSS and
well that's because there's nothing to
talk about I'm not going to go over all
that again we covered we've covered all
this stuff so when there's something to
talk about we'll talk about it Tim will
provide a detailed recap on the r-tx
situation I think in Thursday's video so
a couple of days you'll see that and
then before then he will be doing a full
recap of GPU pricing just like you did
with CPU pricing yesterday so they'll be
worth keeping an eye out for and we will
have more solid information on our TX
2070 pricing for that video and with
that I am going to end this one if you
did enjoy the video be sure to the like
button much appreciated subscribe for
more content if you did enjoy this video
