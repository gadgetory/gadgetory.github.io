episode of it's been two months since
I've done one of these what do I call
this segment again welcome back to
harbor unboxed today we're not doing any
benchmarking we're just having a look at
what's in some boxes that I've had lying
around the office it's a regular segment
don't need to know what the name is it
doesn't know important we're just gonna
get into these boxes and and packages
and things and see what we've got
it's always a bit of fun to show you
guys the prices they come in okay so I'm
gonna get out my trusty trusty trophy
all right so I'm gonna get my trusty
knife time for action we'll start with
this box right here and we'll see what
we've got
that is what we've got in there and what
are these one of these things called
again a graphics card we have a graphics
card I haven't seen one of these things
for quite some time you anyway in a box
I've got some old ones behind me but
yeah a new graphics card was not
expecting that and this is from asrock
there's a new phantom gaming line and
this is an RX 580 so you guys are gonna
be keen eyes to see the review on this
thing because the RX 508 is just a hot
item now easily available for purchase
and just available great prices anyway
on hand we do have the new a0 graphics
card the reason why they've sent over
the RX 580 at this late in the product
cycle I suppose you can say at a time
when prices are a little bit absurd
still they've sent this over though
because they have decided to start
making graphics cards
they're an exclusive AMD partner when it
comes to the graphics cards and they've
started a phantom series which is
interesting because we already have the
gain would phantom series and gain would
are an Nvidia partner so not sure how
that works but anyway
and here is the card reasonably white I
know you guys want to know about the
price I have absolutely no idea not
currently available it is a very white
card actually so not a huge cooler but
there you go the new asrock rx 580
phantom Edition yeah I would say if it
was on sale and available for purchase
right now you'd be looking at paying at
least $350 u.s. because well that is the
cheapest price you can expect to pay for
an 8 gigabyte rx 580 right now really
meant to sell for again these things
that's been so long maybe someone can
dig that up in the comment section and
let me know what the MSRP is for the rx
580 I kid of course but anyway ok so we
just have a single 8 pin power connector
nothing too extreme as I said the cooler
itself looks pretty basic not an extreme
overclocking card it does come factory
overclocked I think by about 40
megahertz it's thirteen hundred and
forty megahertz as the boost so yeah I
think it's about a three percent
overclock not a high percent sure on
that it's been a long time since I've
reviewed and Herricks 580 but anyway
there's the new asrock model very late
in the product cycle but I suppose if
they're gonna start they might as well
start now
I guess I'll probably review this let me
know how keen you guys are for a review
on the channel things like thermals
would be interesting though like I said
it's not a particularly big cooler and
it's a very light card so it'll be
interesting to see how it does get on
when it comes to thermals and I won't
spend too much time on that we'll put
that aside and we'll go into the next
package let's try
let's get into this one here just a
little satchel type thing here and I
don't know what that is
ah that's what that is this is something
I purchased and it is for use on the
channel we used to make more content for
the channel I'll just go it's the GoPro
Hero 6 black so a little GoPro camera
I've got this for doing vlogs not such
for the main channel we have our patreon
account and we do do behind the scenes
videos kind of blog stuff I want to
start doing a few more blog stuff for
the patrons so I've got this I've tried
a few different cameras and I haven't
been happy with them so I'm going to
give this a go and see if that makes it
a bit easier and we have things like
Computex coming up and Tim and I'll be
travelling together to that event so I
want to document that and we'll have a
bit of fun along the way so hopefully
this will be a practical way of doing
that and give the guys that pay us a
little bit per month some extra content
so that's what that's all about and just
quickly for those of you aren't familiar
with the GoPro Hero 6 black it is well
it's obviously the little camera I paid
five hundred thirty dollars Australian
for delivered it does things like it'll
capture 12 megapixel images at 30 frames
per second it does 4k video at 60 frames
per second which is quite incredible
it'll do a half it'll do 1080p now so
full HD at 240 frames per second believe
that is correct it doesn't actually say
on the box but I'm pretty sure it's 240
frames per second which is pretty insane
it has a little touch screen on the back
so that's pretty cool it does have a
wide angled lens that's a glass lens has
advanced wind noise reduction and that
uses three microphones so yeah I mean
it's the go-to camera for vlog for most
action vloggers and stuff well I won't
be doing too much action still should be
pretty handy for what I do my GH fiber
is way too heavy so and I've tried a few
little handy cam things and wasn't
really wrapped with those so see how
this does alright before we started I
think hearing muzzle get rid of this one
a little bit of space for me so we got a
big big garbage bag thinking you know it
doesn't go all the way through thought
that was a hole in it but it's just one
layer all right ah that's some
motherboards here by the looks of it a
lot of gigabyte motherboards and
something something in that but it's
fairly weighty care about three boards
in total fold that away so I don't lose
any fingers by accident okay why don't
we go here this one's a bit crushed in
well it looks okay alright so I haven't
actually covered any h3 70 motherboards
on the channel I've had a few centers by
MSI a few sent over by asrock and now a
few by gigabyte yeah I do plan on
looking at these boards at some point on
the channel I haven't really rushed into
them because we did cover the B 360
boards on when they were released and
did a bit of interesting testing there
but overall I've been pretty
disappointed with the budget boards
we've waited forever in a day for
because they're not really as cheap as
they need to be because we've had said
370 boards out for so long a lot of them
are work their way down towards $100
some even go on sale quite often $400 us
so paying $80 for a locked B 360 board
that's like 10 times worse in terms of
quality and features and that sort of
stuff it's just not worth it I don't see
the point really so that's a bit
disappointing and then you've got the h3
70 boards which are in a really awkward
position in my opinion because well as
you see with this board here they cost
the same amount as these EDD 370
versions and they're not really any
better and instead they're massively
inferior in the sense that you can't
overclock at all on them memory or the
CPU so yeah I mean even if you don't
want to overclock I still don't see the
point because you're not really saving
anything your muscles by the board that
I have a clock
we're not gonna have a clock and it will
be a more sort after board down the
track so if you want to sell your system
it's going to be much easier to sell a
system with a Zed 370 board than an H
370 board so ya don't really want to be
too negative about this because it's not
really gigabytes fault and the gaming 3
model that I have here is an extremely
nice motherboard as you're about to see
it's a really high-quality H 370 board
it's got plenty of great features it's a
really really nice board great vrm great
audio plenty of features all the good
stuff you'd expect on the high end
boards the problem is and this isn't
just gigabyte but this is a $140 u.s.
board $140 u.s. you can get the z3 70
model for the same price and again this
isn't just gigabyte doing this it's all
intel's board partners because that's
how intel prices the platform that's
just how it works out so you don't
you're not gonna find any decent h3 ten
boards for well under what you pay for
is at 370 they're all much the same so
yeah it kind of puts their board
partners in an awkward position because
they've got to try and now sell these
boards so yeah as I said this is $140
u.s. or 220 Australian dollars and you
can buy the gigabyte Xen 370 or ultra
gaming which is a board I have and it's
a fantastic board that's 145 dollars
u.s. so it's five dollars more than this
and well this does have a few extra
features or maybe a few better quality
features overall a much the same you're
definitely not going to notice the
difference and the Zen 370 horas ultra
gaming will hold its value better and be
more desirable on the second-hand market
that's something you care about but
it'll also allow you to use if you buy
like a core i7 8700 the non K model or
later run that with faster memory or at
least overclock the memory so yeah a
nice board here I just don't really see
the point so let me know in the comments
section below what you guys think am I
missing something am I missing the point
of these boards if so please let me know
because I would like to cover them I
just
don't really see the point so having
said all that we have another h3
separate report this one though does
make a bit more sense at least because
is a mini ITX board and there aren't
that many mini ITX is at 370
motherboards so this is the gigabyte H
370 and Wi-Fi and I believe it is
currently selling for $130 us which
makes it about two hundred and ten
dollars Australian and it's a pretty
cool little board as you can see the
only potential hiccup here is again at
the Zed 370 models as I said there
aren't that many of them but asrock are
selling their Zed 370 MITx AC it is on
sale right now as I speak at new egg for
one hundred and fifteen dollars u.s. so
that makes it $15 u.s. cheaper than this
and when it's not on sale it's $30 u.s.
so you can get the asrock 370 board may
not be I think they're pretty similar in
terms of features to be honest with you
but another comparison I could make any
way is the gigabyte Z 370 and Wi-Fi
which is their mini ITX said 370 version
and that costs one hundred and fifty
dollars u.s. so it's $20 more than this
but again you get an unlocked board so
you can use any CPU well you can
overclock the K models on the Z 370
version of this board and only cost you
$20 more to do so so it's not exactly a
huge price premium and the Zed 370 board
does offer two extra USB 3.0 ports and
sort of a heat spreader thing for the m2
slot so not a big change not a big
difference there for your $20 but
obviously the big deal is the chipset
there being out overclock with a Zed 370
but this board still does make sense it
has its purposes for 130 dollars u.s.
it's a really well equipped H 370 board
that will go well in a compact Mini ITX
system so I do see this model in
particular making sense
and then finally gigabyte has again sent
over there X 299 or s gaming 7 pro
motherboard which is a really awesome
x-29 on board
I've already unboxed this on unboxing
boxes in the past but it didn't have
the full retail package so gigabyte has
now sent along another board with the
full retail package so I won't go over
this again because you've already seen
this particular board on unboxing boxes
it's a really good board and might be a
bit of a tough sell these days because
we know that the 2nd gen thread Ripper
CPUs are coming and the Red River is
already arguably better value than the X
299 platform the scar like X CPUs but
anyway that's a comparison for a future
video oh and before we move on what do
we have here so I can drink bottle ok
cool we have a red really shiny
cool-looking red gigabyte probably an
aluminium flask drink bowl thing teeny
tiny packet of do not eat so we'll get
that out of there
give that a rinse out later and give it
a go but yeah thank you for that
gigabyte that'll keep me hydrated during
those extreme benchmarking sessions
alright next up we've got another little
satchel thing we'll find out what is in
there gamers Nexus oh ah Steve from
gamers Nexus has sent over a little care
package we've got some gamers GN
stickers that's pretty cool after find
somewhere to put those and what else we
got in here we have awesome one of one
of these for a while
Bayern GNT showing I put that on well I
don't like to wear t-shirts on the on
the channel but I think this is working
out quite nicely and I have to say I do
really appreciate and love my GN t-shirt
so thank you very much
to the guys over at gamers Nexus for
sending that and I should just point out
that Steve sent this over and didn't say
that I had to feature on the channel or
I think it was just er a thank-you that
he'd sent along so thank you and I'm
more than happy to our unbox any gamers
Nexus products and feature them on the
channel all right let's swiftly move
along to this next package actually we
might try this one first I think I know
what's in this this is another thing
that I ordered I think doesn't actually
sound a label what it is but I have a
sneaky suspicion now I bought two of
these it looks like only a single one
has arrived so fast
hopefully haven't messed up my order but
this is the road reporter Mike and as I
mentioned earlier we are going to
Computex soon Tim and I so I bought one
for Tim and one for me and it is their
interview online so that's pretty cool
we'll better do some really cool
interviews and talk about products on
the showroom floor with this Mike yeah
not much more to say about that for now
I have ordered two so hopefully the
other ones on the way I'll give that a
play a bit later today if I get time and
see how well it works well ok yeah this
one this is ok so what we have here is
the new creative soundblaster cave
thuringer plus and this is a product
more bags do not eat this is a product
that Tim and I could very much use so
once a month we do our patron lives let
me try that again once a month we do our
patron livestream and that's been going
quite well the patrons seem to be
enjoying it we've had one or two hiccups
with audio but this will solve those so
we had one episode of the sound card in
the laptop were using heavily compress
the audio it didn't come out very well
at all but this will solve that the k3
plus so just quickly this is a USB
powered recording and streaming mixer it
does sound effects processing all that
kind of stuff so all you do is plug it
into your laptop or whatever
see you streaming from via the USB that
will power it all and it'll send all the
data as well so one cable takes care of
everything some other cool features
about the k3 is it does provide 48 volt
phantom power and that is to drive
things like condenser microphones and
they'll give you a nice clear studio
grade recording quality the k3 also has
a pair of XLR TRS inputs so you can plug
your high-quality studio-grade mics into
those and they will support pretty much
all microphones that use that connection
and there's also a built-in microphone
amplifier and there's just a heap of
other features like you have this
different reverb mode so I think I
believe there's nine modes where's the
box usually that here you go yes it's
got nine adjustable reverb effects using
the reverb engine so doing how well that
works but I'm really keen to give that a
shot
you can adjust bass treble like I said
there's all kinds of sound effects there
are plenty of connectivity options you
can do a lot with this but obviously I
haven't tried it out yet so I am very
keen to see what the audio quality is
like and Tim and I will use it on this
month's live stream the patron at live
stream so the patrons hopefully will
enjoy the audio quality this month and
for those of you wondering it is a
hundred and thirty dollars us and it's
not currently on sale in Australia so
don't have Australian pricing as yet
okay one last I think and we have the
biggest box to get through and I'm not
sure what is in this one
Wow
it looks like we have a lot of
knocked-over packages yep that went
poorly okay well it was probably the
worst way I could have gone about doing
that but it's done now okay so recently
I put together a build inside the in win
at Chopin it was a Raven Ridge build and
I initially did with the cry rig c7 and
I wasn't really happy with thermal
performance it was quite loud and I was
just really disappointed overall so I
then switched and made a couple of small
modifications to the Wraith stealth box
cooler and found that while temperatures
were a little worse the operating volume
was significantly better and I much
preferred that option then in that
second video heaps of you for asking me
to check out the new AM for version of
nock to his low profile cooler and that
is the l9a
so I reached out to knock door and said
can you send out the l9a they said
absolutely would you like to look at
some other stuff I told them I do a
little unboxing boxes segment and yeah
they they sent me everything they make I
think well that's pretty nice little
presentation there so this is the cooler
that I want to put inside the Chopin and
I will shortly and see how that cools
the horizon 520 400 G so should be
interesting but there it is there that
was what I was after and thank you very
much to knock for for sending that along
also along for the ride we have the L
12s let's have a quick look at that so
this is another low profile cooler it's
not low enough to go
inside the Chopin it will suit other
sort of mini ITX builds slightly bigger
ones with discrete graphics cards and
whatnot so that's another good cooler
that we'll be able to check out in a
future build and we also have the owl 9
x 65 se another AM for cooler and I'll
give you guys a quick look at that I
don't think this will fit in the Chopin
either but boy if it did it would work
really well maybe I ought to make some
modifications to the case to squeeze
this in so that might be something
pretty cool to do for a future video let
me know if you guys want to see some get
the Dremel out and do a few mods and see
if we can do something pretty cool with
that then we have all the new chrome axe
accessories to go over some of the
bigger coolers like you know the D 15s
the D 15 all that sort of stuff I do
have those coolers somewhere in the
office okay so we've got basically that
is to make it look well too black sort
of cover so if you've got if black works
with your build that would be good this
is a black with green highlights that
looks pretty fancy so we got those too
but another one here what's this one
this one's white so if you're doing a
white build that will look good oh and
sorry I should just note that the I just
looked at the picture here the green
ones you actually have a multitude of
colors it looks like half a dozen at
different colored strips that can be
inserted to give you different color
highlights this yellow green white black
so that is B black on black blue and red
so plenty different color options there
then we have what looks like you 12s
yes--you 12s series so again same deal
and we got the white and probably
possibly something yep right in front of
me black so that's pretty cool have to
test all those out then it looks like we
have some of their premium n ff12 fans
yes nice black fans I like that and
again you can change the little silicon
anti-vibration pads that go in the
corners of the fans so you've got the
same range of colors there and it looks
like they've sent a long
we've got one two three four fans so
we've got four fans ten we have an
assortment of tables so let's just sort
them into Califf categories well I'm
gonna have no shortage of cables fan
cables and things for future bill so
just have a quick look at the blue ones
here all very nice so these are four pin
fan extension cables and they're blue
and we've got them in red white yellow
green black and blue and the second box
just has splitter cables so off a single
fan header you can run two fans and
again they come with all the various
colors so that's pretty cool and I'll be
definitely using these in a future build
if you have any questions about any of
these Noctua accessories just ask him
down the comments section below and I'll
answer them I'll test a few of these
things out after this episode of
unboxing boxes and again you'll see a
lot of this stuff in future builds we do
on the channel okay last package is a
tube so let's see what is in the tube I
have a pretty good idea of what's in
here and who sent it I reckon a lot of
you guys will recognize this it is the
mod map from gamers Nexus so not only do
I have the t-shirt I have the mat to go
with it so pretty stoked about all that
well smell that mod matte goodness check
out that thing that is huge the
Americans say it's four foot by two foot
whatever that means I have to leave it
sit for a while so it D curls itself
well it really is a nice grippy surface
alright so this is a GM Park so let's
get serious and a bit technical for a
moment because that's always call for
when you're talking about anything gene
related
so the mod map is primarily used for
modding things as the name would suggest
so or if you want to tear down a
graphics card like I will do with this
guy when we review it you can put it
down here and when you pull it all apart
you can lay out where the screws went in
the graphics card so you know where they
go back into it's also obviously an
anti-static mat so it won't damage any
electrical components when you put it
down on the mat so that's very good and
while you don't mind me saying but
gamers Nexus has been particularly
ballsy with the creation of their mod
mat because there they're stating
correct thermal paste application now
that's a hot topic to touch on that one
there and while I agree with the methods
they have displayed here I don't know if
I'd be as bold to I have included that
on the map but it's great they have now
when I do my builds and I use a an
approved official GN method of applying
paste I can point to the mod mat and say
well and it's hard to argue with that
you've got a little section down here
for working out what format M to drive
you have whether it's a you know a 20 to
80 or a 20 to 60 you just place it down
there and if it fits in that well you
know what you've got so that's pretty
cool and then we've got the this must be
the the science studio inspired PSU
wiring diagrams there so Greg probably
has one of these now in the first two
every time he builds a PC so that's
that's good I'll pay attention to that
and then you might be wondering what
this little clip here is in the bottom
right hand corner well I know Steve he's
a very serious character and he likes
his facts and his figures and getting
the truth getting the bottom of things
and doing everything correctly and
that's what we love about him but from
time to time
he does let his hair down and although
he won't admit it publicly
he loves RGB lighting just loves it
behind closed doors you can't shut him
up about how much he loves RGB lighting
so just subtle he's included this little
device here little power cord you
connect this to your power outlet and
you've got two headers here which you
can connect an RGB light strip to and
that just gives the mod mat a bit of
bullying lights up the work area I think
this has been designed in collaboration
with Corsair I think it's dubbed the
light bus that'll just run across you
can put one at the bottom and one at the
top of the mat to really just set it off
so that's a nice feature they're not
including the light strips with the mod
map that's an optional extra so they do
include this header cell sort of sucks
you anything I would like to have the
RGB white strips to just set my own mod
mat off but anyway that's what that's
all about
no need to ask any more about that I
don't know what this thing's for so we
won't worry about that yeah so that's
what that's about
I'm probably going to water the optional
extra light bars because you know I love
my RGB just like Steve all us Steve's do
oh yeah but that is the mod map it's
really thick I think it's four
millimeters thick you can feel it it's a
premium product it's quite weighty about
four pounds I believe you've got your
ruler at the bottom there's some strange
measurement at the bottom above that
you've got millimeters and centimeters
which makes sense and yeah and Oh Steve
as I said does a lot of technical
in-depth testing they're always refining
their test methods and that's what we
really respect and love about gamers
Nexus they're always trying to find the
best way to do things part of the mod
matters as I said you can put your
graphics card there and keep track of
where all the screws go but you can also
use it for measuring out of the box
thermals for example you just you can
get your heat sinks and you can put them
on the anti-static mat and you can grab
you
again yep just as I thought degrees
Celsius so basically the mod map just
allows you to do all the kind of
professional in-depth testing that you
see it gamers Nexus so you can replicate
that at home you can do you add the box
thermal testing your tear downs you can
correct people on their thermal paste
application that's an important one
you'll never blow up your SSD by using
the wrong cable and yeah it's just it's
great has everything I love it so big
big THANK YOU to Steve for sending this
over along with the t-shirt love them
both dearly and I will be using the mod
map for all our projects going forward
and just wrapping up this sponsor spot
for gamers Nexus if you would like to
own your own mod mat then head over to
the gamers Nexus store use referral code
harbour unboxed is superior to get 10%
off and that is going to wrap this
little bit up obviously that was all
just a bit silly and not serious again
Steve just sent this over as a present
he said you didn't have to show this off
on the channel or he actually sniff
stressed not to show it off on the
channel I didn't have to after seeing
this he probably is gonna wish that he
made me sign an NDA where I couldn't
show it off on the channel but anyway
thanks Steve appreciate your for sending
this over and it is really a
high-quality impressive bit of kit and I
am keen to do some tear downs and stuff
I will be tearing down the Azeroth
graphics card on the mod map now so keen
to give it a go doing all that sort of
stuff and I'll work out what that blue
bracelet is for I'll get on to Steve and
ask him a few questions anyway thank you
Steve for sending this over I do
appreciate it very cool stuff and well
that concludes another episode of
unboxing boxes I've remembered the name
of the series so we're back on track a
great little motherboard I think that
one does make sense let me know what you
guys think about H 370 boards that cost
as much or more than quite a few Z 370
boards and then we have the Azeroth
graphics card let me know if you can to
see a review on this and what you'd like
me to focus on obviously pricing makes
that one a bit iffy I'll be doing some
vlogging for the patrons
I'll be staying hydrated while I do it
and next month's livestream should sound
pretty good so that is going to do it
for this episode of unboxing boxes
thanks for watching thanks to gamers
Nexus for sending over the cool gear and
that concludes this episode I'm your
host Steve and I'll catch you again next
