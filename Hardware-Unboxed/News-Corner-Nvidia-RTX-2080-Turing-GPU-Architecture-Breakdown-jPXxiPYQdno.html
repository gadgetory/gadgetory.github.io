news corner lots of big topics emerge
this week including some actual
legitimate concrete information on
next-gen geforce cards and a few intel
related stories AMD also of course
launched second gen thread rip of this
week which we already covered earlier
with our comprehensive review in case
you missed that so yeah all up it's been
pretty massive on the news front let's
kick things off by looking at invidious
latest teaser for next gen geforce cards
i'm sure a lot of you have already seen
this but just in case you missed it in a
video posted a video titled be for the
game to hype their event of games calm
that's happening on August 20th at this
point it's virtually a certainty that
the video will announce new geforce
cards on that day which is actually only
a few days from now so that's pretty
exciting i think the evil and methinks
it would be extremely funny if nvidia
came out and hosted an entire event on
August 20th without mentioning new
geforce cards whatsoever to the shock
and disappointment of thirsty gamers
worldwide but it seems like that's not
going to happen instead we're in for a
boring or launch event however the
launch date isn't the interesting thing
about that video king viewers spotted a
number of easter eggs in the video that
point to the name of invidious next
generation geforce cards there's been a
fair bit of discussion surrounding
whether in video will go with the gtx
1180 or gtx 2080 for this generation but
it seems from this teaser video that the
name nvidia has chosen is the RT x 2080
yep RT x 2080 video cards has a neat
list of all the Easter eggs in the video
mostly from the various chat apps shown
for a split second the key ones are
stuff why not underscore 11 and plenty
of references to 20 like Mac 20 and
Zenith 20 there's also a user name of
Roy Tex with arty and X capitalized
which again suggests RT X 2018 aiming
this fits with the naming scheme from
videos new Quadra GPUs which are called
things like the RT X 8000 the reason for
RTX browning is the architecture these
cards are using Turing has a new ray
tracing unit we'll get
the truing architecture in just a moment
but apparently this inclusion of
ray-tracing functionality is large
enough to warrant a revamped naming
scheme Steve will be extremely happy to
hear it's the GeForce 20 series and not
the eleven series because he's been
predicting the 20 series since the start
of the year despite countless rumors
suggesting eleven series branding so
he'll be reminding me of that for a long
time and no doubt everyone in our
patreon exclusive discord chat will be
hearing about it as well
NVIDIA has been using gtx branding for
generations the 200 series was the first
line to use GTX as a prefix to the
numbered name but was also used for many
generations prior as a suffix for
high-end cards like the 9800 GTX the
first ever card to use the GTX name
appears to be the GeForce 7800 GTX which
launched in 2005 anyway enough of that
history lesson for now let's hold that
until August 20th where we'll learn more
about the r-tx
2080 in other interesting and video news
this week Nvidia announced their next
generation truing architecture at
SIGGRAPH 2018 this is almost certainly
the architecture that will be used for
the GeForce 20 series though at SIGGRAPH
in video is focused entirely on the
architecture for compute cards and in
fact announced the new series of quad
row products as truing will be used for
the RT x 2080 most likely let's take a
look at what we can expect an antic has
a great article in the specifics but
we're going to be taking a bit of a
high-level look the SM which is very
important for gaming workloads packs up
to 16 teraflops of single precision
compute performance and that's compared
to 13 teraflops in Pascal so that's a
23% uplift in compute performance but of
course that will only be unleashed in
the highest-end configuration with
Pascal that was the Titan XP with the
little P that saw nearly the full 13
teraflops unleashed while the GTX 10
atti was more around 11 teraflops in the
GTX 280 more like 9 teraflops
with the geforce 20 series will once
again be getting that top-end
performance with a titan class product
but with truing we can expect it to
outperform the best
pascal card it should also that perform
invidious Volta architecture the fully
unlocked a Quadro GB 100 packs 14.8
teraflops of computer
indicating cheering built on the same 12
nanometer process will improve
performance by around 8% a large uplift
from Pascal's possible as in videos
jumping from 60 nanometers down to 12
nanometers not as relevant for gaming
workloads truing includes a tensor core
for deep learning compute type stuff
this is a specialized unit ants designed
for low precision compute with 125
teraflops of FP 16 performance along
with new support 4 into 8 and into four
at a huge 250 and 500 Terror ops
respectively new tutoring and something
that will no doubt be interesting for
both compute workloads and gaming is the
specialized article which is a hardware
unit that provides accelerated ray
tracing top entering GPUs will be
capable of processing 10 billion Ray's
per second which is a 25 times
improvement on Pascal which does not
have an accelerated rate racing scheme
this will be key to improving ray
tracing performance for rendering
workloads in 3d design but I suspect it
will also help bring ray tracing two
games for significantly improved
lighting at least in a limited capacity
with the first generation of the RT core
in geforce products for memory truly
supports GDD r 6 the next generation of
GD r memory at speeds up to 14 gigabit
per second at least initially samsung
has g DDR six available up to 16 gigabit
per second however for now we're looking
at the more common 14 gigabit per second
configuration on a 384-bit bus which is
the widest truing supports G DDR 6 at 14
gigabit per second will provide 672
gigabytes per second of bandwidth which
is up 23% on the fastest gddr5 X
configuration in the Titan XP it's also
faster than the HBM 2 included with the
Titan VIII and of course that used a
massive 3090 2 bit bus other features
ensuring include native support for
real-time 8k 8gb see encoding with the
25% improved bit rate 8k DisplayPort
support invidious new virtual link
connector for VR headsets and NV link
that provides 100 gigabytes per second
of bandwidth it's hard to say exactly
what is included in the largest fully
unlocked truing GPU in terms of core
configuration and so forth however we do
know it features eighteen point six
billion transits
is nuts down slightly from the 21 point
1 billion included with voltage GV 100
this 18 point six billion transistor
truing GPU is being used in the new
Quadra RT x 8000 card and that card
provides 16 teraflops with 4608 cuda
cores which suggests a fully unlocked
churring GPU has 4600 night cause there
are also 576 tentacles and with the RT x
8000 you'll be getting 48 gigabytes of
gddr5 6000 gives you the same compute
performance but just 24 gig of GEDs
the $6,300 an antic are estimating clock
speeds for these Quadro cards at 1730
megahertz to achieve 16 teraflops of
performance there's a possibility a
consumer-grade card will push this even
higher like has been the case with past
geforce cards vs Quadra anyway that's
the cheering architecture will be
interesting to see how it's cut down
next week for the launch of the ITX 2080
as we're probably not going to be
getting a fully unlocked GPU straight
off the bat a lot of cool stuff in there
though I spent about half this episode
talking about invidious new GPU stuff so
let's move into some other stuff Intel
also you see graph two T's some graphics
related stuff the company set up a new
Twitter account called Intel graphics
and posted a teaser video talking about
all their graphics achievements so far
the video reiterates that Intel is set
to unveil their discreet graphics
architecture in 2020 to compete against
nvidia and AMD this isn't new
information but there were a few rumors
floating around earlier this year the
suggested Intel would be announcing
their GPU at CES 2019 which is clearly
not true judging by everything in tower
said so far and factoring in the usual
GPU development cycle become 20/20 the
GPU market could be getting a whole lot
more exciting as usually it wouldn't be
a news corner without a few dodgy
sounding rumors here's one from HD
technology our website I hadn't heard of
before today suggesting Intel is working
on an x5 99 express chipset to support
their 28 core h EDT platform you might
remember back at Computex Intel
discussed a new 28 core h EDT cpu and
claimed it could run at 5 gigahertz
despite the demo system using
cooling and being overclocked then it
was discovered that CPU is basically a
zealand platinum 8180 running on a
modified server class board with an LGA
3647 socket a suicide aboard called the
rog dominus while gigabyte also had a
prototype board with a ridiculous vrm
configuration to support the high end
chip apparently if this room is to be
believed in tones going ahead with the
launch of LGA 3647 CPUs in a new h EDT
platform that will use an ex 599 chipset
will likely be getting 24 to 28 core
CPUs on its platform while the existing
LGA 2066 socket and supporting platforms
will be used for up to 18 core CPUs
another quick rumor here this one from
video card showing that the core o 999
hundred K and possibly other 9000 series
processes will be soldered an
official-looking slide suggests a new
feature for these chips is a soldered
thermal interface material or what
they're calling a stim among other
things it can be easy to fake these
slides but it would make sense that an
eight-core 16 thread CPU like the Cora
999 hundred K would use solder rather
than crappy Tim it shouldn't be too long
before these CPUs are announced so we'll
find out soon enough whether this is
true final news topic of the week as
Seuss's announced what they're claiming
is the world's slimmest gaming laptop
the rog Zephyrus s which joins they're
already pretty slim zephyrus line up the
laptop uses a similar design to the
original Zephyrus but it's obviously a
few millimetres slimmer while still
packing an Intel Core i7 87 58 CPU and
either nvidia geforce gtx 1060 or gtx
1070 max-q graphics the laptop should be
available in September
although pricing hasn't been announced
just yet that's it for this week's news
corner stay tuned for more news next
week because in video will almost
certainly be announcing new graphics
card so the joy of all gamers subscribe
