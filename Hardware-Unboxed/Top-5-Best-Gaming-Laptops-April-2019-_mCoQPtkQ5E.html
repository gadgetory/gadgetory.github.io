we're going to go through which gaming
laptops are the best you can get right
now it has been a couple of months since
Nvidia launched there RT X line of
discrete GPUs for laptops prices have
settled a little bit the market is in a
clearer position so really there's no
better time to make some recommendations
I'll be going through five categories in
this video discussing the best options
plus a few other alternatives the
categories are a mixture of price points
and use cases so I think it should cover
most of what people will be interested
in getting and yeah well let's get right
into it
first up we have my personal favorite
category portable slim and light gaming
laptops I think this is what really
sells the concept of a gaming laptop you
should be able to take around with you
without needing to lug around three to
four kilograms it should be slim and
easy to carry and have decent enough
battery life that it's genuinely useful
off the charger of course it also needs
powerful hardware for gaming the best
option right now is the msi ge62 five
stealth at fifteen point six inches in
size or alternatively the GS 75 stealth
if you'd rather the 17-inch very I've
tested most of the slim and light
offerings in this new RT x generation an
msi stealth line is simply the best the
reason for this is it delivers the full
performance of the components inside
without throttling while doing so at
respectable fan noise levels on top of
this it's the lightest of the main
portable gaming options giving it
another edge on its competitors but the
Alienware m15 for example is noticeably
heavy and larger while also having
cooler problems thinking about air a 15
X 9 is a decent offering but it's
allowed cooler and inferior design
Caeser port behind the MSI option and
the asou Sepphoris while decent in a
number of areas has an awkward design
with its side position trackpad
aside from beating its competitors the
msi ge62 5 stuff packs decent hardware
headlined by a 1080p 144 hertz display
intel core i7
8750 h cpu and 16 gigabytes of ram the
default 256 gigabyte SSD option is a
little on the small side but it can be
upgraded relatively easily while
bachelor life is also pretty good there
are a number of GS 65 and GS 75 variants
out there including older Pascal GTX
models and newer Turing r-tx models the
best option right now is the RT X 2060
model it's normally priced at 2100 US
dollars but can occasionally be found
for below 2000 making it around the same
price as the older gtx 1070 max cube
variants the ITX 2060 is about 8 percent
faster on average than the GTX 970 max
euwe making it the better value choice
the higher tier options with the RT X
2070 max Q and RT X 20 80 max you are
priced at 2,400 and 2,800 dollars
respectively but performance gains of
15% or less really aren't enough to
justify that price hike of course if you
want more power these models are
available but today the RT X 26
is the sweet spot
it feels like every time I go to update
my gaming laptop recommendations the ace
of predator Helios 300 always comes out
on top in the budget category this
laptop is still priced at around $1,000
for the gtx 1066 gigabyte model making
it still the best value gaming laptop on
the market so let's go through why this
remains the case if you want something
with a gtx 1066 q bite inside around
that $1,000 mark is about as cheap as it
gets but asa hasn't compromised much to
hit that price point you're still
getting a full Intel Core i7 8750 H
processor unlike a quad core Core i5
model in some other budget offerings
you're still getting a 1080p 144 Hertz
display with 16 gigabytes of RAM and 256
gigs of storage really nothing there is
cut back from the norm while you're not
getting with the Helios 300 compared to
higher tier models is mostly in the
design this isn't a massive system but
it's not overly slim there's no crazy
RGB keyboard effects no premium
materials no slim bezels and the battery
life is nothing special but ASA has made
those sacrifices to deck the system out
with the best hardware and that's why it
remains the best entry level gaming
option there are some other models that
do get pretty close the asou stuff FX
500 for being one it's not quite as good
as the Acer laptop and around $100 more
expensive right now but if you're
checking prices in the future and the FX
500 for ends up in a good spot it's one
I would consider for those after a 17
inch model the Acer Aspire 17 is one to
check out however there is one direction
I wouldn't go in and that's to buy
anything below at GTX 1066 gigabyte this
GPU really is the sweet spot if you opt
for something like the GTX 1050 TI yeah
you might end up saving $250 or so but
the 1060 is easily more than 50% faster
so that's not a good value proposition
and as you go lower in price laptop
makers tend to strip back features like
storage RAM and CPU so overall you end
up with a much lower quality product
save your cash and drop $1000 on the
hero's 300 and you'll be much happier
with your purchase
while this category is called best bang
for buck there's more of a focus on the
bang than a bucket because we already
have a budget category that offers
excellent value instead this category is
for those that want to a bit of a step
up in performance over the gtx 1066
gigabyte but still want something good
value that won't break the bank
when you step up a tier there are
several options on the market right now
we have the older gtx 1070 and the newer
RT x 2060 and RT x 2070 however when you
look at general laptop pricing and
compare that to the performance you're
getting it really doesn't make sense to
buy a new turing r-tx laptop right now
gtx 1070 laptops at $1500 are cheaper
than RT x 26 to that prophet start
around $1,700 for similar configurations
however the gtx 1070 is actually faster
sometimes upwards of 10% faster so it's
really not worth buying an RT x 2060
laptop the ITX 2070 for laptops does
pull around 15% ahead of the gtx 1070
but typically costs between 20 and 30%
more so again it doesn't have that bang
for buck factor with all this considered
right now the gtx 1070 offers the best
value for upper mid-range laptop gamers
and the one laptop that stands out to me
in particular is the isuzu ROG Strix car
to GL 504 GS the name is a bit of a
mouthful but you're getting a really
excellent laptop at $1500 right now slim
bezels around the 15.6 inch 1080p 144
Hertz display a full non max-q gtx 1070
a 512 geek SSD 16 gig of ram and of
course the core i7
8750 h the chassis is your standard mid
tier body but I think it's really
appropriate for this sort of machine and
it's cooler allows the GTX 1070 to run
at its expected performance when I
review this laptop last year the major
sticking point for me was the price but
it's come down significantly since then
to become a great value option those
that want the next step up in
performance will probably have to go for
the RT X 2070 models at around 1,800 to
2,000 dollars which isn't completely
outrageous as these systems are faster
but the gtx 1070 is where the sweet spot
currently is offering a similar price to
performance ratio as jtx 1060 laptops
the extreme laptop category isn't a
category I normally like to recommend in
because I feel if you're after one of
these enormous chunky beasts with
high-end hardware inside you're probably
better off building a small form factor
desktop PC which will be cheaper and
faster but you might have a use case
where you really want a top-end gaming
laptop in which case I'll recommend the
seuss ROG G 703 GX this is a big heavy
17 inch laptop it's a huge 51
millimeters thick and four point seven
kilograms heavy but it packs a full r-tx
20/80 for laptops inside and thanks to
the enormous cooler throttling isn't a
big deal aside from that you're looking
at a core i7
8750 H 17.3 inch 1080p 144 Hertz display
512 gig SSD plus one terabyte sshd and
16 gigabytes of RAM at $3,000 I feel
this is probably the best value option
of the r-tx 2080 systems with good
enough cooling to actually unleash that
GPU now of course you can go bigger and
faster than this but really the value
drops away quite significantly even just
adding the Karoo 989 50 h k into the mix
a slightly faster although unlocked
version of the 8750 H will cost you
around $800 and then you can go up to
stuff like desktop CPUs and multi-gpu
configurations which again really aren't
worth the exorbitant price should be
paying if you have say five thousand
dollars to spend or more a better option
would be grabbing something like the msi
ge62 5 to use on the go for around
$2,000 while dropping $3,000 on a decked
out gaming PC to your desk that would be
more than enough cash to get a decent
r-tx 20 atti gaming rig which will be
faster than anything currently available
in a laptop form factor so the Asuza ROG
G 703 GX is really the top end of what I
think is reasonable for a gaming laptop
the final category here is for those
that want to buy an ultra portable
system saying the standard 13 size
category but might want to do a bit of
light gaming on the go what is the
absolute fastest system you can get in
that sort of form factor well it might
surprise you how few gaming capable
systems there are with 13 inch displays
at one point this was sort of an
emerging gaming laptop category but that
quickly evaporated in favor of 15-inch
portable gaming laptops so these days
what we're left with are plenty of
systems with no discrete GPU a growing
number within videos okay but not
amazing MX 150 and mx2 50 GP offerings
DX 150 is good for games that aren't
very intensive like overwatch fortnight
in csgo but what if you want something
with a bit more oomph well there's
really only one option and that's the
Microsoft Surface book 2 in its 13-inch
variant this is as far as I can tell the
only laptop on the market of this size
to pack a proper gtx 1050 in its chassis
the gtx 1050 is definitely still an
entry-level discrete GPU but it's easily
more than 50% faster than an MX 150
which opens up more gaming options at
medium and low settings
unfortunately the privilege of having a
gtx 1050 and a 13-inch system comes at a
huge price hitting out a surface book
too with the required hardware to get
this GPU will set you back $2,000 but
you'll probably want more than 8
gigabytes of RAM and a 256 gig SSD in
which case you're looking at more like
2,500 bucks that's more than most
portable 15-inch gaming that props for a
much lower level of performance so
you'll really have to want the service
book to his excellent portability to
justify getting it over a system that's
truly designed for gaming with that said
the service book 2 does have a lot of
advantages like the detachable tablet
section full style support and a high
resolution display which you don't get
with most true gaming laptops so it's
just a balance of what you might want
and how much gaming you should factor
into your buying decision that's it for
the selection of gaming laptop
recommendations I'm sure there will be
plenty of you that will disagree with
the devices I've chosen so enjoy arguing
