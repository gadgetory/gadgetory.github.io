corner today's episode it's gonna be a
bit different to some of our past news
corner episodes and that at least the
first half is going to go through some
odds and ends from our suite of Rison
and Navi reviews over the last week
there hasn't been too many new stories
to emerge this week with all this review
action will cover the big ones later but
at least for now let's talk about some
review related stuff so let's start with
one of the bigger issues I'd guess you
have to say from the reviews this week
and that's the whole bio slash
motherboard clock speed and booth
situation issue I guess this done after
an antic discovered their MSI
motherboard wasn't boosting AMD's 3rd
gen rise in parts correctly and went on
a mission to update every result to
account for improvements to lightly
threaded tasks so for starters Steve
used an MSI x5 70 creation motherboard
for his testing and spotted no issues
with boost behavior or performance so as
far as we can tell our results are
representative of the true performance
of these CPUs our 3900 X for example did
clock up to 4.6 gigahertz with the
single thread loaded as expected
gamers Nexus also did an investigation
with a gigabyte board comparing the
performance of various BIOS and a juicer
revisions and found very small
performance gains in some situations
compared to the early BIOS versions but
overall the findings weren't significant
enough to change the overall margins or
thoughts all that much it was only those
like an antique that were having issues
that were pretty significant and
required a large overhaul of their
results it does seem like every release
we see these sorts of reports come out
about how people have tested stuff wrong
and there's always 10% more performance
left to be waiting to be unlocked I
guess you have to say with the right
configuration but this rarely pans out
just seems like a few people having
typical early teething issues with their
motherboards we didn't have any such
issues and yeah we expect the results
will be representative of what you guys
would get if you do end up buying these
processes with that said overall we have
done some additional testing with other
motherboards and I found that gigabytes
X 570 boards seem to provide the best
performance in lightly threaded gaming
workloads didn't really affect our day 1
review but with some of the other games
Steve is testing for the 30 game
benchmark video that's coming
soon you know two small games with
gigabyte similar to what gamers Nexus or
when you tested the latest BIOS versions
Steve will have more to say on that in
the 30 game benchmark video which will
be comparing the 3900 X to the 9900 Kate
stock and overclocked in many more
titles than recovered in the first video
that big benchmark will be going live
next week so stay tuned for that
arriving on the channel the one thing
that was impacted from our day 1
coverage was our world wars are your
results
we noticed in that game that all rise
and CP was performed around the same and
well behind Intel which we thought was
odd but as with all these launches you
can get some interesting numbers then a
few days later we received a patch for
World War Z and spotted a huge
performance uplift Verizon which Steve
mentioned briefly a few videos ago
well we reached out to AMD and they
confirm that a patch did get released
for World War Z their improved rise ins
performance significantly the patch
actually launched before we did our
testing but the epic game store didn't
deliver it to us until just a few days
ago the update brings Rison much closer
to Intel when CPU limited will be using
those updated results for our ongoing
testing like a review of the 3,800 x
that we want to get to as well as of
course the big game benchmarks the other
stuff I would like to touch on briefly
relates to Radeon image sharpening that
video that went live yesterday did
better than we expected and got quite a
few comments so there's a few things
that I just want to quickly cover
obviously the main focus of the video
was resolution downsampling and
comparing Radeon image sharpening versus
DL SS for this task that's mostly
because both AMD and NVIDIA have been
talking about these respective features
for improving performance at high
resolutions a lot of you guys have been
asking about how Radeon image sharpening
fares against other sharpening tools
including ray shade and sweet effects
along with invidious own tool found
within freestyle since there's been a
lot of interest in that I will cover
that in a follow-up video so stay tuned
one thing I will say though is we aren't
going to use random image sharpening for
our performance testing in the future
some people have been saying to compare
the rx 5700 XT with image sharpening at
4k to Nvidia cards and native
resolutions
pretty much not going to happen the
reason is you can use down sampling
brush wrapping with any GPU you just
need a tool like Ray Shane it might not
be as good but it should get close I
would spoil that further maybe just
provides the easiest
yet with radiant image sharpening and
are the first company to talk about
using sharpening in this way with their
GPUs anyway I've got enough extra
thoughts on this to fill an entire new
video so stay tuned for that initial
impressions though are that it's the
best and easiest solution to harness the
power of resolution downsampling while
not being totally unique or original
more to come though okay
now into some news topics for the week
haven't been to many of note with the
mega week of AMD benchmarks and so on
but I'll just run through the exciting
ones here to start with video cards and
hardware Lux have revealed that MSI will
be launching seven custom Radeon rx 5700
series graphics cards while this
information did leak from them we've
basically confirmed that everything is
legit and it sounds like MSI isn't too
concerned about this information
floating around before launch so the
seven cards in question are split
between for 5700 XT models and three for
the 5700 both GPUs are getting air boost
Mac OC and gaming X models and there is
an image showing off what the Mac OC
will look like if you couldn't guess
it's like many of MSI's custom GPU
designs over the past few years
especially for AMD GPUs the 5700 XT is
also getting an Evoque OSI model
unfortunately don't have much other
information to go on aside from these
model names
these cards are set to bring quite a
substantial improvement over the AMD
reference cooler for Navi we've seen
lots of complaints about the blower fan
running hot and loud so I think these be
few designs will go a long way to
alleviating the issues there and it
seems with MSI offering gaming X models
which are typically reasonably high and
cause AI beats aren't going to sit
around and only offer a few Navi options
you've also been interesting to see how
far a RBS will push factory overclocks
given it seems the 5700 XT in particular
has quite a bit of headroom MSI will be
bringing their AIB cards to the market
in August it seems like this is the
default time for basically or AI bees
perhaps some will leave it to September
but it shouldn't be too far away we'd
probably advise those interested in Navi
to hold off for the IRB models
especially if they come in at the same
price or close to a mary's reference
cards and of course this would be models
from all sorts of vendors if you're
after a more extreme cooling solution
for your Navi GPU ek waterboxx has a new
full coverage GPU block for AMD's Radeon
rx 5700 series the unit is compatible
with both reference GPUs and
coal plant covers all of the GPU GDD are
six memory and vrm we're getting eke as
usual open split flow micro channels and
sealing through high quality EPDM or
rings as the materials the base is made
of copper or nickel plated copper while
the top is available in acrylic or black
acetal if you go for the acrylic option
the block itself is illuminated with RGB
while the assertive option gets an RGB
white corner element you can also add on
a backplate if you would like these navi
box will begin shipping on July 26 with
pricing around 125 250 euros depending
on the model throw in an extra 27 and 34
euros for the backplate so certainly
quite expensive relative to the price of
the GPU but as an enthusiast product
that's always what comes with the
territory
and I believe Steve is getting these to
review or at least test out so yeah I
guess we'll have some more Navi related
testing on the channel shortly with
these water box for a brief period
Intel's Core I 990 900 KF got a price
cut and spotted by text bot and PC Gamer
a few days ago the I 990 100k F was
listed at just 440 US dollars on Amazon
which is around 40 to 50 dollars less
than the usual asking price for the CPU
and quite a decent deal considering the
high price in tusk 8 core has usually
occupied unfortunately the deal was
extremely short-lived as of right now
the 1900 K F is back up to a standard
$480 so the discount wasn't permanent in
fact it didn't even last for a couple of
days there have been some rumors that
Intel would soon discount the prices of
their ninth gen core processors in
response to Amy's aggressive rise in
3000 series products and pricing but so
far that hasn't eventuated maybe we'll
get that soon final topic I just want to
cover is the state of Emma size
motherboards with horizon 3000 series
CPUs we've been getting a number of
tweets and comments at us about people
having issues with MSI 400 series
motherboards in particular P 450 boards
with ambe's new CPUs so just want to
chat a little bit about that here
firstly we haven't seen any issues with
B 450 boards ourselves with their gen
rise and chips including the tomahawk
that we've loved to recommend a fair bit
we're not 100% sure where the issues
could be but hopefully they will be
resolved soon through BIOS updates we do
know that a lot of om like MSI didn't
recieve CPUs like the 3700 X and 3900 X
before they went on sale to the public
so it seems
testing has been done with other samples
and might have contributed to some of
these problems not 100% sure whether
that's been the cause but we did hear
that again yeah some of those CPUs that
you guys now buy weren't actually
available to OEM to test with until the
final release yeah the problem MSI and
other board vendors have is small BIOS
chip sizes many older motherboards have
just a 128 megabit aka 16 megabyte flash
chip for storing the BIOS but every time
AMD pushes out and UAG some micro code
update the size of it grows
substantially to accommodate all the new
CPUs this is putting limits on boards
that were built using once when yet
megabit chips rather than the larger 256
megabit options some board vendors have
resorted to releasing light versions of
their BIOS with compatibility for all
the chips stripped out and often with
simplified interfaces MSI seem to be
doing something unusual and releasing
revised 400 series boards with larger
BIOS chips they're calling these boards
the max a series with everything from
the export 7e gaming plus to the B 450
tomahawk - even the a320 ma Pro getting
a max version this updates the board
with a 32 megabyte BIOS chip and allows
full compatibility with AMD same for
lineup without needing to cut down on
the bias interface or features they
should also ship with out-of-the-box
support for third gen Rison the reason
this is important is that 400 series
boards will remain popular for quite
some time especially with X 570 boards
often costing at least $200 for budget
builders of B 450 motherboard is the
best choice and MSI wants to continue
offering the best B 450 boards on the
market hence the minor revision that's
it for this week's news corner subscribe
