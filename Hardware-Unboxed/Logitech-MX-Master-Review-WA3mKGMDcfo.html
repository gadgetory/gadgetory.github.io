I've always enjoyed using that MX
installments in particular the MX 500
sat on my mouse pad for several years
back in the day and have laid up in
using their g502 proteus spectrum in
particular for gaming for some reason it
feels like I receive about a plus five
aiming buff and i use it moyes on the
lookout for something new and exciting
however and from the first time i used
the logitech MX master i was extremely
impressed logitech have set out to build
a true flagship daily driver with the MX
master and i believe they've done a
wonderful job can you take your first
glance at the mouse you're immediately
impressed and for me personally the
shape and design is reminiscent of a
sleek high-end sports car the overall
look and impression that this mouse to
live is visually you could only be
described as absolutely premium the
matte black main body looks as
comfortable as it feels and I personally
love the chromatic bronze trim that goes
a long way toward that aforementioned
premium look the two wheels on the mouth
are highlights too with a shiny chrome
trim and matching bra and center lines
additionally the thumb rest features a
mosaic of the tell-tale logitech
triangles found just in front of this
striking feature three small green LED
battery indicators that fit in nicely
themselves all of this comes together
spectacularly in my opinion if there's a
better looking mouse out there then I'm
yet to find it despite these good looks
logitech hasn't gone for form over
function and comfort not at all it's a
rather big mouse and as you can tell
it's purely designed for right-handed
users I think the MX master can suit all
grips really however those that user
parm group will be pleased by its larger
size expansive thumb rest and high back
side the left and right mouse buttons
are angled off just right and for daily
use I haven't found a more comfortable
device additional to the well-crafted
left and right mouse buttons the mouse
features two fantastic scroll wheels I
love to see the inclusion of a
horizontal scroll wheel and I personally
find it particularly useful for
scrolling through the timeline when
video editing minor issue I found the
second scroll wheel is that its
placement is pushed back the forward and
back buttons on the side of the mouth to
a position where they now don't rest
directly next to my thumb I tend to use
these buttons
browsing more than i used the horizontal
scroll wheel i did have to get used to
pulling my thumb back a little to reach
them the main scroll wheel has some
tricks up its sleeve too aside from the
obvious clicking functions it can switch
to the classic logitech free spinning
mode automatically when you spin at a
certain rate this point eventually to
free spin mode can even be adjusted in
the logitech software to this is the
feature I love to see and a very cool
implementation you can toggle the free
spin mode on and off with a dedicated
button just behind the scroll wheel to
now the scroll wheel isn't the only part
of the mouse with the trick up its
sleeve the generous thumb rest that I
mentioned earlier can also act as a
gesture pad you can customize your
gestures and the functions that they'll
activate in the matching logitech
software this is pretty cool once you
get set up and I found use of functions
like popping up the Start menu showing
the desktop and the media play and pause
button very intuitive on top of this as
well as being a gesture pad there's a
sneaky clickable button beneath the
thumb rest to the by default will open
up another for possible gestures DMX
masters connectivity options are great
too it's a wireless mouse and it can be
connected to up to three different
systems with the ability to switch
between them seamlessly you buy a small
button on the bottom of the mouse this
is extremely handy if you have a
multi-device living room for example and
you don't want to clutter your coffee
table with several pointing devices the
device switching work flawlessly for me
carrying the mouse to a device with
built-in bluetooth is easy and connect
to non bluetooth devices via the
included USB dongle unlike logitech
gaming mice that we've reviewed the MX
master doesn't utilize the logitech
gaming software instead it uses a suite
called logitech options in this suite
you can play around with button
assignment sensitivity the
aforementioned gestures and enable or
disable features entirely unfortunately
the DPI levels can't be customized
however but I didn't find this deal
breaker at all so usually only end up
using the DPI levels to change pointer
speed on the go performance wise the MX
master is excellent the bluetooth isn't
flawless however I suspect this is more
dependent on the technology than the
implementation
not only encountered very brief losses
in connection and responsiveness the
1600 DPI dark field laser works very
well in all kinds of surfaces to even
glass logitech claims the battery lasts
40 days at eight hours use per day and
it charges quickly by our micro USB
cable for gaming this is of course not
the most suitable mouse but I still
found it highly usable even for
first-person shooters and I was happy to
play a quick game or two with it in
between work overall the logitech MX
master is an exceptional piece of
technology it's easy switching
connectivity excellent sensor awesome
scroll wheel setup and clever gesture
button really set it apart features wise
and I really believe it's the
best-looking office mouse on the market
today the only things I'd change about
it at the side thumb buttons position
and I suppose the price although $100
these days on newegg it's pretty great
value for something you'll use and enjoy
every single day thanks for watching
