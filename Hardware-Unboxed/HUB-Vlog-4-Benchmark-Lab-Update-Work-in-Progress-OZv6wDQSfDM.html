current condition of our benchmark lab
if you miss that video will provide a
link in the description below or add a
card above so you can check that video
out since then I've pulled mostly old
stuff out and begin the process of
replacing it so that's what you're about
to see I'm hoping this time next week
I'll be able to show you the finished
product so fingers crossed anyway let's
teleport upstairs and take a little bit
progress so far well I've been at it for
a few hours now guys just got this thing
left and everything else has been pulled
out as you can see there's a huge mess
left behind that are all clean that up
okay so progress report I have finished
the what is it basically the backing of
the shelves the shelves to be so that's
pretty well done you can get a good look
at that and over here that's really
putting sort of the smaller shelves to
hold all the graphics cards shall focus
in on that yes all across there so there
should be I think about four or five
shelves will go there and then we'll
have the biggest shelves here and that
allow hold all the products so as you
can see the networking lights a bit of a
mess got to sort that out but I'm pretty
happy with how it's going so far hoping
to have the shelves in the next few days
and then I can turn my attention to that
mess so yeah not looking forward to that
it's going to be a bit of effort but
anyway we'll get it done
you
so still in a huge mess here in the
office but we do have some shelves look
at that the bottom shelf saw most
complete heaps of shelves for graphics
cards and product boxes
it's hard to get the holeshot in with
this lens but you get the idea for
getting the shelves all nice and level
at its bottom one here which is
perfectly level I'm about to get the
legs in for the second shelf and get
that all leveled use this little guy
here and it is a laser level it works
very well and as you can see it paints
this line yeah and it'll go the whole
length and then i can raise or lower the
shelves as need be so top of the shelf
stays along that line and then i get
nice straight shelves that simple so
yeah it's just this thing they're not
hugely expensive but they make this kind
of stuff very very easy this one's
pretty useless outside during the day
you can't see the line but if you if
you're doing a retaining wall or
something you can sort of dip out in the
afternoon towards sundown and it works
pretty well then but you can get ones
more expensive ones that work during the
day as well they're very handy a lot
easier than trying to do it the
old-fashioned way so yeah that's where
are up to hoping have the shelves
finished by the end of today
okay so an update on the office build
this is where we are at the shelves are
pretty much done at this point so you
can see I've got a couple of the
graphics cards on there so that's
working quite nicely
okay then the shelves have just got
stuff just throwing on them at the
moment as I finish the rest of the
office so I've now got my little feature
wall all the way around that's nice I'm
doing a bit of plaster repair today here
I'll repaint that and then it'll be
ready just about ready to put the desk
the desk tops on speaking of which I've
made you can see these suckers down here
and what they're going to be part of my
cable management so what they're going
to do is I'm not sure how am I going to
film this they're going to be mounted on
the wall like that and the desk is going
to sit on top of this point here and
then in this channel here they'll be a
bit of timber and the desktop will be it
won't go flush against the wall so
they'll be a bit of a gap and this here
will be a cable management channel so
I'll be able to tuck all the cables down
behind the desk and all just land in
here I'll probably better give you guys
a better idea of how that's going to
work when I finish it but that's the
plan anyway with these so that should be
pretty cool but that's where right now
and I will keep working and hopefully in
a couple of days I've got to move back
into the benchmark lab and get some
serious benchmarking done well that's
all I have fear for today's update I'm
very pleased with the progress so far
and I hope you guys enjoyed this all
behind the scenes sneak peek hopefully
later in the week i'll have another
channel related update video for you
guys and this one will be with matt he
can explain first ten what's going on
why hasn't come back just yet and he's
plans for the channel going forward so
that will be good to finally address
since i know you guys been asking for
ages what's the deal with matt when
coming back yeah yeah yeahs now so we
will address that finally and also just
a side note for you guys who have been
asking if and when Matt does come back
as he hasn't decided yet for reasons
that he will explain himself I will be
staying and developing delivering
content on the channel indefinitely so
that won't change no matter what Matt
ends up doing so just so you guys know
the channel will go on other than that
I'm a few cool benchmark comparisons
coming up there will be at least two
good videos this week one really
in-depth benchmark comparison I'll be a
GPU type article and then I'll probably
come in a few days but tomorrow there'll
be another benchmark video focusing on
cpu performance so keep your eyes peeled
for that speaking of which I have better
go do some testing I'll catch you guys
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
