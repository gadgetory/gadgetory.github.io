video held their CES 2019 keynote and
Jensen came out right away and made it
very clear they were here to talk about
gaming so to our surprise they weren't
gonna spend the bulk of the keynote or
just banging on about automotive
announcements so yeah that was kind of
nice that said Jensen did start with a
stroll down memory lane by discussing
the evolution of gaming graphics and you
guessed it that led us to retracing
after talking about rate racing for
about ten minutes we got onto the
cheering architecture and then Jensen
proceeded to spend about another ten
minutes talking about tensor cause and
Artie cause like we'd never heard about
them before but I suppose maybe it's
slightly different audience at CES but
you'd expect that most people are
familiar with that kind of stuff now
anyway you guys probably are quite
familiar with Turing's architecture and
tensor calls and Artie calls so I'm just
going to skip all that I'll spare you
the details
Jensen then moved on to show us a brand
new ray tracing demo yeah another one of
those wasn't a game it was just a pure
tech demo and we were reminded a few
times that it just works so I guess
Jensen's sticking with that one-liner
for now not sure if he's realized it's
become a bit of a joke internet meme or
maybe he's quite happy with that anyway
Jensen I confirmed a few times that the
demo was being rendered in real time
didn't specify by what but I can assure
you it was something much more
substantial than a pair of 2080 T eyes
we saw more and more demos they seemed
to just keep going and going more talk
of ray tracing how brilliant it is and
how it just works and it's awesome and
it's beautiful and it's amazing it's
wonderful and all that kind of stuff
yeah a lot of the stuff you've probably
already heard and then we saw a
battlefield 5 real-time ray-traced
demo well it's not a demo it's
battlefield 5 being ray-traced
but it's something we're very familiar
with and it's something we've covered
here on the channel a lot and in their
own demos a lot of the issues that we've
talked about such as noise and stuff in
the reflections when you move gamers and
exes has covered that in great detail as
well all that stuff was still present
how
at the end of the demonstration Jensen
claimed that it was running on a single
r-tx 20 60 at over 60 FPS at 1440p and
yeah that is with ray tracing enabled
despite the fact that the 20 60 only has
5 gig arrays per second of RT
performance and that's down 17% from the
twenty-seventh es6 key grades per second
the key to enabling this performance was
DL SS although using DX our ray tracing
in conjunction with D LSS and we sort of
caught wind that this was going to be
possible in battlefield 5 but obviously
we haven't been tested for ourselves yet
because they haven't released the patch
that enables you to enable DL SS so this
is something Tim will have to do in the
future so anyway we have to presume it
they were upscaling from most likely
1080p so that's why the performance at
1440p was well I suppose what we'd
probably expect to see at 1080p are
using the quality settings that they
used and for the demo they used the high
in game quality preset so that's one
level below Ultra which we typically
test at and then they use the medium
level DX our quality setting so still
that's pretty impressive I think
obviously we'll have to wait till we get
our hands on it and test out how it
really performs and what the image
quality is really like that kind of
stuff Tim I'll probably dig into that
and yeah I'm very interested in what Tim
comes up with when he looks at Els s
enabled with ray tracing so it looked
okay in their demos but yeah I'm very
keen for Tim to do his own testing there
anyway for now we know the RT x 2060 is
going to come in at 350 dollars u.s.
that's the MSRP and that is slightly
below the release price of the gtx 1070
back in June of 2016 I probably should
have chose my words a bit better
actually because I said it's going to
come in at 350 dollars and I can't
actually ensure that that's going to
happen so yeah who knows what it will
come in at the MSRP is $350 us but it
could hit shelves at $400 u.s. is the
cheapest option or 450 dollars u.s. so
we'll just we'll have to wait and see on
that one it also comes with six
gigabytes of gddr3 70 will be available
in a game bundle though it's not
certainly a bundle of game that's just
bundled with a game so you have your
choice of battlefield 5 which I believe
is already an option for the 2070 but it
will now be an option for the 2060 and
then those cards will also have the
option of anthems that's a game coming
out next month oh yeah so you can choose
battlefield 5 or anthem but yeah just to
be clear it's not both of those titles
so yeah the card will be released next
week so the r-tx 2060 will be coming
next week on January 15th that's when
it'll be hang shelves are available
online all that good stuff
hopefully for $350 us but like I said
we'll have to wait and see on that one
and I believe at this point reviews will
be online a day before so January 14th
for all the reviews not home research
sure on that one but I believe that's
one that will be in video didn't really
give us much to go on in terms of specs
but they did comment on performance so I
suppose take that with a grain of salt
but they did anyway they sent the are
cheques 2060 is 60% fast and the GTX
1060 in today's games so that's a pretty
massive jump forward I get that the GTX
1060 is a 250 dollar product and this is
a three and fifty dollar product but
even so it's still a pretty big jump in
performance the GTX 1070 is around 35 to
40 percent faster than the GTX 1060 so
based on that we can expect the RT X
2060 to be faster than the 1070 which
really wouldn't make it that much slower
than the 2080 so yeah we'll just have to
wait and see on that one
Jennsen also a little bit later on
notice that the RT X 2060 is faster than
the gtx 1070 TI which is pretty crazy
given that on average the 2070 is just
7% faster than the tiny in our own tests
there's not really a huge difference
there between the 1070 TI and the 1080
so yeah I mean I realize these numbers
are coming from in the video but even so
it does seem a bit unlikely that the
2060 is going to be that much slower
than the 2070 and yes that's true that
will that will finally be some good news
for gamers as the 2060 will cost about
30% less than 2070 if I had to guess
reading between the lines I am expecting
the 2060 to come out pretty much neck
and neck with the gtx 1070 I know Jensen
said it's faster but I think
it's probably going to be about the same
overall anyway if that is the case then
that will be a pretty good outcome for
gamers
I mean relative to what we've been given
so far just a bit of extra info that I'm
going to squeeze in here after the
keynote and video publish to the RT X
2060 specs on their website so we do
have some more information about the
specs the GPU features 1920 criticals
clocked it up to 1680 megahertz and the
GDR 6 memory is the same 14 gigabits per
second stuff used by the other RT X
models using a 192 bit wide bus it has a
throughput of 336 Giga bytes per second
so this means the 2060 has just 17
percent fewer cuda cores than the 2070
but cost 30 percent less so it sounds
like a pretty decent deal to us moving
on from the RT X 2060 Jensen talked
about g-sync announcing AG sync
certified program basically they're now
supporting adaptive sync monitors at the
driver level so some adaptive sync
monitors are getting G sync support in
video said they tested 400 monitors and
a dozen of them were awarded the g-sync
spec and this means that they will get
GeForce adaptive sync support via a
driver actually also after the keynote
please be aware that we are just piecing
this video together pretty much on the
flier so it's not as well-structured as
it normally is anyway after the keynote
and video also announced on the website
that adaptive sync monitors that are yet
to be validated as G sync compatible
they might still work a new Nvidia
control panel option that will be
available in a new driver and will allow
owners to try and switch the tech on and
they say that it may work it may
partially work or it might not work at
all so yeah that's kind of interesting
and it kind of backs up with the
comments that I'm about to talk about
that Tim made on our discord chat with
our patreon members Tim suggested our
patreon discord chat yes I'm kind of
calling him out on this one putting it
out there more public but I'm sure he'll
get over it
anyway Tim said in our private discord
chat that he suspects that Nvidia or
this is invidious first step in global
support for adaptive sync I said that
Nvidia can't just come out and say
adaptive zingers now good enough
because they've been saying that G sings
better for years now and he suspects at
some point in the future and video will
say something like and we were able to
make all adaptive sync monitors good on
NVIDIA hardware and now we support every
adaptive C monitor Tim also noted that a
video has technically been doing this
for years it's how they support G sync
on laptops so some interesting thoughts
here from Tim even if I have thrown him
in the deep end that's that we have
discussed this sort of stuff on the
channel in the past and our QA and stuff
and we sort of expected this would
eventually happen anyway moving on we
got into mobile gaming and Nvidia
announced the artex mobile series and
this included at least to the r-tx 2080
and RT x 2060 but we can presume it also
included the RT X 2070 it was claimed
that the mobile RT X 2080 is faster than
a desktop GT X 1080 and Jenson also
announced there will be a record 40-plus
GeForce r-tx laptops 17 of which will be
max Q models and they will be available
starting January 29th so that brings us
to the end of the keynote just a single
RT X 2016 model that's announced and no
mention of the what was at the GTX 1160
or whatever the rumor was it was also
rumored that it would be a I think it
was a three gigabyte and four gigabyte
version of the GTX 2060 which I suppose
still could happen we didn't really
expect that they were just bombard us
with a heap of different 2060 models at
the initial announcement so yeah those
models still could follow down the track
with some quiet launch just obviously
we'll keep an eye on that but at least
for now there is just a six gigabyte
2060 and honestly I hope it does stay
that way everything went pretty much as
expected though the 2060 might end up
being a bit faster than what we were
initially expecting and if that is the
case well yeah that'll certainly be nice
for now though you will just have to
wait till the 14th to see our day 1
coverage and for that we will most
likely have in videos Fe model along
with a few board partner cards from the
usual suspects and that is going to do
it for this one if you did enjoy the
video we showed it the like button
subscribe for more content just like
this we will have plenty more CES
coverage coming so if you're interested
in that yeah make sure you subscribe hit
little bell icon thing so you're
notified and yeah if you want to support
us more directly you can do so on page
you're on that will grant you access to
our discord chat where you can see old
claim is made by Tim and myself and you
can also watch our monthly live streams
anyway thank you for watching I'm your
host Steve see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
