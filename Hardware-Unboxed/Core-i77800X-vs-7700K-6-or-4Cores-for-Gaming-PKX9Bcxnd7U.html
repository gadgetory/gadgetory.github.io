that long ago I compared the horizon 5
1400 1600 and r7 1700 in half a dozen
CPU intensive games and found the six
core 1600 offered a nice 40 percent
performance increase over the quad core
1400 that said though the eight core
1700 was just three percent faster than
1600 so it seemed quite clear for those
building a new high-end desktop gaming
rig the r5 1600 was the sweet spot with
its six cores and twelve threads those
findings had many viewers that were more
interested in building an Intel system
asking if they should buy the core i7
7700 K which is a quad core processor or
the new six-course 7800 X I'd say the
reason why so many were asking this
question is down to the fact that the
700 cost us $1 us more and we fed as I
said you get two extra cores but you
also gain access to Intel's latest and
greatest high-end desktop platform of
course there are other cost
considerations here but I'll discuss
them more towards the end of the video
so before we jump to the benchmark
results here is a quick look at how the
two Intel CPUs compare on paper as you
can see the 7700 K has a clear clock
speed advantage out of the box that's
what I will be overclocking both CPUs
perhaps the biggest difference seen here
is the cache design the 7 100x features
six times more level two cache only
about the same amount of level 3 cache
of course thus every 100x also packs 50%
more cores and with that the TDP has
been increased by a little over 50% so
to test these two processes out in terms
of gaming performance we have 30 games
in total all of which were tested using
the geforce gtx 980ti
on both the core i7 300 X and 7700 K the
7x was configured with 32 gigabytes of
ddr4 3,200 memory in quad-channel
while the 7700 K was armed with 16
gigabytes of dual channel memory for
comparison we tested both processors
stock so as to say in their
out-of-the-box configuration as well as
overclocked configuration the 7700 K has
no trouble hitting 4.9 gigahertz so
that's where we've tested it and the
semi 100 X was fairly comfortable at 4.7
gigahertz ok that's pretty much
everything so let's jump into the
results
first up we have world of tanks not a
particularly demanding game but I'm
pretty much throwing everything we
normally test at these CPUs here we see
that out of the box is 77 okay is 9%
fast and the 700x not a huge margin
though and it was surprising to find
that what overclocked the six course if
you still couldn't match the 77 okay
anyway this isn't a CPU intensive game
as I said and since we are pushing over
100 FPS at all times the margins are
somewhat irrelevant Grand Theft Auto 5
is often used for testing CPU
performance and here we find some
unexpected results comparing the minimum
result we see the 77 okay is a massive
30% faster than the 700 X overclocking
reduced that margin to 18% but still
given that there is just a 4% difference
in clock speed once overclocked this is
a huge win for the quad-core CPU again
when overclocked the 700 X is still
slower than the stock 7700 K 10% slower
in fact when comparing the minimum frame
rate since player unknowns battlegrounds
is such a popular title right now I
thought why throw it into the mix so
that's exactly what I've done if you're
playing with a dual-core or lower end
quad-core processor for example and
things aren't going that well don't
bother spending big by investing in the
7800 X according to my testing you will
see almost 30% more performance when
using the 7700 K but Witcher 3 is often
talked about for being a very CPU
intensive game and to a degree it is
that said the 77 ok is more than capable
of getting the most over 1080 Ti in this
title and here we see much the same
performance across the board the section
I use such as rise of the Tomb Raider
features varied environments out in the
open frame rates are quite low while
indoors we see them rise much higher
anyway what is important to note here is
that overclocking made little difference
the performance of the 700 X while I
suspected 7700 K was probably able to
get the most out of the 1080i
again the 7700 K was the superior
processor in this title
offering just shy of 20% more
performance
regrettably I decided to test ashes of
the singularity at using the max quality
settings or the crazy preset as they
call it and that was a bit of a mistake
as the GTX 10 AGI became the primary
bottleneck here that said with well over
60 FPS at all times that's certainly
more than you need to play this
intensive realtime strategy game now
these results are very very interesting
for a few reasons
first of all the six core sea
if you get absolutely blasted by the
slightly higher clocked quad-core now
you might be thinking these are results
don't look right and I have to say I'm
with you on that one I did triple check
the numbers though and they are indeed
accurate interestingly this is very
reminiscent of what we saw when
comparing the eight core rise in seven
1800 X to the core i7 serving seven
heard K the horizon processor in that
scenario was much much lower than the 77
okay
that said though given what I'm seeing
here the 1800 X might actually be faster
than the overclocked 7800 X in this
title so that's something I'm keen to
check out soon the divisions again that
we found to be very GPU bound in the
past and as I said this is a 30-game
comparison so it's just thrown in to see
if there's anything unusual going on
here like what we saw in Far Cry primal
as you can see though there isn't so
let's move on hit man's again that's
proven to be quite demanding and can
take advantage of six core CPUs that
said the seventy-seven decay is by far
the more superior CPU in this title
offering 50% more performance than the
seven 100x interestingly once again
overclocked in the 1700 X doesn't really
help close up the gap we weren't seeing
any kind of throttling issues I was on
the lookout for those using Hardware
monitor oh yeah it was running at the
advertised 4.7 gigahertz the whole time
moving on quantum break is another
primarily GPU bound title that said
though is Far Cry primal and we saw some
odd results there anyway here the 7700 K
and 7800 X provides similar performance
okay so you've got 12 threads
no worries over watch we'll put them to
good use even so the city 100x isn't
able to pull the head of the 77 okay in
this title the margins were similar but
once again the quad core was
consistently faster I never actually
include do many my CPU benchmarks and I
always get attacked by AMD fanboys for
excluding it apparently is a Vulcan
based game it should be included I'm not
sure why that is but as you can see the
200 FPS frame cap kicks in pretty early
here with the 1080 Ti making this a
rather pointless test that said though
at least this time we do see some decent
performance gains from the overclocked
7800 X oddly here is another game where
the 700 X is much slower than the 77
okay
and yet overclocking doesn't help close
the merge and can't really explain why
that is maybe someone watching has a
theory the 7700 K doesn't gain any
from performance either but I would have
just assumed at this point we were
running into a GPU bottleneck Mirror's
Edge catalyst is another game that's
primarily GPU bound at least using the
ultra quality settings at 1080p with the
GTX 980 TI so not much else to say other
than the fact that both CPUs enabled
exceptional performance f1 2016 is often
found giving low to mid-range CPUs a
really hard time and while it can take
advantage of a six core CPU the 7700 K
is just so fast as it is the seven 100x
isn't able to capitalize I would have
expected Deus Ex mankind device to throw
up some results look very GPU limited
though surprisingly the 7700 is
noticeably faster especially when
looking at the minimums overclocked
still offered 7% more performance than
the 7800 ex
Battlefield one was tested on the
outskirts of an active 64 player map
it's a little easier to replicate the
results here anyway the 7700 K was again
clearly fast other margins weren't huge
but the quad core always served up the
best results once upon a time mafia 3
murdered all quad cores like a ruthless
gangster these days though it's a lot
more mellow and it's happy to get along
with all types of CPUs in fact it's now
more favorable when it comes to quad
cores and like most games prefers those
megahertz gears before fore throws up
some unexpected results here the 77 RK
was 20% faster when comparing the
minimum frame rate and 16% faster once
both CPUs are overclocked another clear
win here for the aging quad core
titanfall 2 is never really giving us
anything other than GPU bound results
and here nothing changes both CPUs push
the gtx 1080i to in excess of 130 FPS at
all times
testing civilization 6 using DirectX 12
you might expect it to favor the six
core CPU at least I know I did anyway
yet we find quite the opposite here
again I went back and reconfirm these
results on both systems as they just
didn't seem right turns out the other
and we find another game where the 7700
K offers almost 30% more performance
than the 1700 X dishonored 2 favorites
the quad-core CPU by a 12 percent margin
when comparing the minimum frame rate
and we see much the same when comparing
the average frame rate as well the 7700
K is clearly the faster CPU for this
title
watchdogs to is a heavy CPU user and
here the 700x is able to roughly match
to 7700 K not something we've seen in
all the CPU intensive games tested so
far testing with Resident Evil 7 we see
the 7 100x does trailer 77 ok by 7%
margin when stock but once overclocked
both processors deliver similar
performance and presumably we are
getting the most of the gtx 1080i here
veronica's a heavily GPU bound title and
we see that again here all
configurations provide roughly the same
average framerate that said the minimum
frame rate does differ a little bit and
the overclocked 7700 K does provide the
best results wild land is another
heavily GPU bound game so the margins
are quite close but the 70 Center ok was
able to deliver a few extra frames Mass
Effect Andromeda is another game that
isn't that heavy on the CPU despite the
fact that it will spread the load quite
evenly across a large number of threads
anyway not much to see here is a 77 here
ok and 78 her decks provide very similar
numbers yet another head-scratcher
this time it's dawn of war 3 that
provides the puzzling results the 77 ok
was 45% faster a litter box and the
margin remained much the same once
overclocked a very disappointing
performance here from Intel's latest 6
core high-end desktop CPU like a lot of
the games tested prey isn't very
demanding on the CPU this one will play
perfectly smooth on a pentium g 4560 for
example so no surprises that the 706
pace with the 7700 k here it's quite
surprising i would thought by this stage
of the video it'd be the other way
around but anyway finally we have do it
for and this isn't a title I expected
the 700 K to fall behind in but once
again it has here the 7200 K was 15%
faster out of the box we again see
another example where overclocked in the
78 her ex doesn't really improve
performance prior to when you're
overclocking the 700 consumes just 6%
more power than the 77 ok and these
figures are based on the average
consumption recorded in 6 of the games
tested so the 700 X certainly isn't
being fully utilized here I would expect
to see slightly higher power consumption
we've both CPU is overclocked with 700 X
now consumes 13% more power again not a
huge difference it is interesting to
note though that while the 700
often didn't see much in the way of
added performance from the overclock it
did still increase power consumption by
16 percent alright so some very mixed
results seen in the games tested and
without even telling them up it's quite
clear the core i7 see 100x was rather
underwhelming the 77 ok clearly seems to
be the best option for gamers and while
perhaps this is why we have the 77 40 X
yeah now that CPU still makes no sense
ok so out of the box before we do any
tinkering the 77 okay what's on average
11% faster than the seve 800 X across
the 30 games tested for the minimum
frame rate then overclocked that margin
was reduced to 9% and summing up all 30
games this way the semi our X doesn't
actually look that bad despite being
slower overall here is a look at all the
games side by side the average figure is
a little different here and this is down
to the way that the figures are rounded
anyway the 77 ok was 13% faster at the
stop clock speeds when comparing the
minimum performance in all the games
tested as you can see Far Cry primal and
Dawn of War 3 were a problem for the 700
X while it also struggle the Hitman
Grand Theft Auto 5 Civilization 6 player
unknowns battlegrounds and doom roughly
half of the games tested did see very
little difference between the CPUs and
surprisingly of those games quite a few
of them were very CPU demanding tunnel
such as overwatch ashes of the
singularity battlefield 1 and to an
extent f1 2016 for those of you that are
going to drop a comment below saying
that games such as city skylines ARMA 3
and planet coaster for example should
have been included as they are very CPU
demanding I'm just going to quickly note
that no they're not yes it is true that
all three games run horribly on quad
cores when the action gets going but I
can tell you they still run just as
horribly on 6 8 and 10 core processors
their limitations come from the game
engines they're built on or it's just
the coding in general you will find much
the same for game such as Starcraft 2
for example this is why games such as
ashes of the singularity are so
impressive moving on identities high-end
desktop models aren't really meant to be
gaming CPUs but it's not unrealistic to
expect that gamers with a bit of cash to
splash would be looking at Intel score X
lineup particularly the 6 core 7100 x
given how well it over clocks the
extreme memory ballot
and the fact that this is Intel's
premium desktop platform you'd be
forgiven for thinking that 700x would
actually be superior to the 77 or ek at
least in the latest and greatest titles
this sadly just isn't the case in fact
far from it and given what we saw in
comparing the risin 5 1400 1600 we know
that some of these games can make good
use of 6 core CPUs you could argue the
7700 superior IPC performance and higher
frequencies makes up for what it lacks
in cause and this is why the 1700 X
wasn't able to show the kind of
advantage you might have expected but in
my opinion it goes beyond that for me
that just doesn't really explain why the
1700 X was just flat-out slow in this
comparison for quite a few of the games
tested at a guess I'd say the reason for
this is down to the restructuring of the
cache hierarchy when compared to the
7700 K the 7800 acts has quadrupled the
level 2 cache per core while the shared
level 3 has been reduced by 30% per core
it is believed it was restructuring
combined with the way this new cache
works make Scarlett X more suited for
server related tasks and less efficient
when it comes to things such as gaming
and well we're certainly seeing that
here had the core i7 simmer her ex
actually beat in the 77 okay then we
would have to weigh up things like
platform costs and the the additional
cost of the processor and work out if
it's actually worth spending more on the
semi 100x but of course given the
results none of that is necessary if
you're a gamer get the 7700 K or
alternatively look to AMD's rise and
line up speaking of which I'm keen add
the horizon 7 1700 to these results and
I'll aim to do that next week so stay
tuned for that I'm your host Steve see
you again next time guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
