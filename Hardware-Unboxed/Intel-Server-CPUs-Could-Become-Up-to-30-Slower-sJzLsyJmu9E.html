please excuse the mess here I was doing
something else but we've briefly hit the
pause button on benchmarking to cover a
rather interesting news story now I
decided to cover this news story sort of
last minute rush tip because the comment
sections of all my latest benchmark
videos how it has been getting spammed
with links to news stories covering at
the topic that we're going to discuss in
this video and the users that were
posting links for claiming that all the
benchmark results are now invalid
because Intel CPUs are about to become
30% slower now this news comes after a
somewhat difficult or at least
concerning you for Intel as they went
from complete market dominance to well a
little less dominant the tide is
starting to turn let's say actually I
might be downplaying AMD's achievements
a little bit here in 2017 Rison
certainly transform the desktop
landscape thread Ripper certainly
changed the high-end desktop landscape
and while the epic CPUs they've been
wreaking havoc on the server side so
with all that the last thing Intel
needed was a serious CPU bug to be
discovered and addressing it could have
a huge impact on performance perhaps
even worse still the bug impacts almost
every Intel processor manufactured over
the past decade the problem is within
the Intel x86 64 hardware and it can't
be fixed with a simple micro code update
rather in order to fix this major
security flaw a significant operating
system redesign is required and then
impacts pretty much all operating
systems such as Linux Mac OS and Windows
the exact details of the vulnerability
have been placed under embargo and this
is a given tell time to work on a fix
now it's been reported by the register
that the floor could allow normal user
programs to see some of the content of
protected kernel memory areas for those
of you wondering a kernel is a program
that is at the core of the operating
system and it connects software
applications with the hardware
components in your computer such as your
CPU your system memory your
basically anything else attached to your
PC keyboard mouse monitor all that stuff
this means any malicious programs might
be able to read information like
passwords login keys cached files and
well pretty much anything this is
obviously a serious issue for not just
users like you and I but it seems
companies that use virtualized
environments are the biggest targets for
those looking to exploit the
vulnerability for example Microsoft
Amazon and Google are all working on
fixes to be implemented over the next
week now for those of you wondering no
this does not impact AMD processors they
are completely free of this bug an AMD
software engineer did have something
interesting to say about the issue when
he speculated that Intel's processes
might execute code without performing
security checks and presumably they do
this to maximize performance so while
it's speculated that Intel went about
this shortcut let's say to improve
performance the band-aid or patch well
that's going to come with a massive
performance penalty the solution being a
kernel page table isolation or kpti
patch this separates the kernels memory
from the user processes unfortunately
though this solution increases the
kernels overhead causing the system to
slow down anywhere from 5 to 30 percent
depending on the task and of course the
CPU model for desktop users though it's
possible the patch whine actually have
that much or any impact on everyday
usage and that also includes gaming
performance and said though we just
don't really know yet we'll have to wait
until Microsoft rolls out their fix and
that is expected to happen by the tenth
so next week patches fill the next
kernel though they're already available
and tech cipher onyx has done some
benchmarking quite a good bit of
benchmarking I'll link that in the video
description so you guys can check that
out it looks like though that servers
are mostly going to be affected by the
patch and that is affected is in a
reduction in performance while gaming
and video rendering light sort of stuff
we do on the desktops that seems to be
mostly unaffected of course in typical
harbor and box fashion we do plan to
test the impact of this patch for
Windows users next week and will report
back our findings then for now though
this looks to be an incredible blow for
Intel with AMD already breathing down
then
they really can't afford to give up any
performance on the server side what's
your take on all this and do you believe
there will be any major repercussions
for Intel as always we'd love to hear
your thoughts so drop them down below in
the comment section and well that's
gonna do it for this one I'm your host
Steve I've got to clean up all these
graphics cards and continue benchmarking
for tonight so yeah I'll see you again
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
