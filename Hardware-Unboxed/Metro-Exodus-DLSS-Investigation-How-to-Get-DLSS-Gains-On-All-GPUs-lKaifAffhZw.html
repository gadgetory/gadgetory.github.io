it's time for our final look into Metro
Exodus exploring the last remaining key
technology the game includes and that's
invidious deep learning super sampling
or DL SS which is exclusive to their new
chirring RT x graphics cards I didn't
want to explore DL SS at the game's
launch because the developers weren't
happy with the implementation they said
they were gonna patch it to improve the
quality and we actually to their word
that update arrived a few days after the
initial release with drastically
improved DL SS quality I've spoken about
D LSS a few times before on the channel
our first investigation was way back in
September of last year and that looked
at the demos Nvidia had provided for D
LSS and I concluded from those demos
that DL SS looked like an upscaled 1800
P image while providing roughly the same
performance then just a few weeks ago I
returned to look at DL SS in battlefield
5 which was a terrible implementation
that looked noticeably worse than an
upscaled 1685 p image making dl SS a bit
of a fail in that game now we're
returning to a Cadell SS in Metro Exodus
and I've got to say my expectations are
pretty although after seeing it in
battlefield 5 hopefully the technology
works better in a different game and
we'll explore the quality differences in
a moment like with battlefield 5 DL SS
in Metro Exodus is locked down heavily
depending on the GPU you have the
resolution you're playing at and the
quality settings and 4k you're able to
use the OSS with either ray tracing on
off with the RT x 2070 and above but
this is the only resolution where you
can use DL SS with that ray tracing and
1440p you'll need to switch ray tracing
on to access the OSS although it works
with all RT x GPS at this resolution
then 1080p again same story with ray
tracing but only the RT X 2060 and 2070
are supporting again this will
disappoint people that wanted the best
performance in this title with these
restrictions in place you can't use dl
SS to boost performance up into high
frame rates for example a 20 ADT Iona
can't boost their 100-plus FPS gameplay
at 1440p up to 140 FPS with D LSS
instead small for boosting 60 FPS
gameplay or boy
up into the 60 to 80 FPS range in most
cases as always all the usual test
system notes apply here as well I'm
using micro 999 hundred K test rig with
16 gigabytes of RAM and for this set of
testing just the GeForce r-tx 2080 TI
with all other settings set to ultra and
hair works disabled for improved 1%
lower performance I've tested in two
configurations 4k with ray-tracing
disabled and 1440p with ray-tracing
enabled starting with the performance
comparisons deal SS in Metro Exodus is a
little different too in battlefield 5
with battlefield 5 deal assess
performance was around the same markers
rendering the game at 1685 p but with
metro Exodus TLS s is more at the level
of 1800 P rendering in other words the
performance uplift in Metro Exodus isn't
as large as the performance uplift in
battlefield 5 so the equivalent
resolution scaling option sees the game
rendering at a higher resolution while
1800 P data here is from a custom 1800 P
resolution Metro Exodus also includes a
shading rate option the closest to 1800
p.m. both performance and visuals is a
zero point seven time shading rate from
what I've experienced the 0.7 times
shading mode option performs a little
worse than proper 1800 P while also
looking slightly worse as well all three
down sampling options provide a round of
21% performance improvement over native
rendering in general with a 28 DTI the
game is capable of running at a little
above 60 FPS without ray tracing enabled
using DSS or resolution scaling bumps
that up to around 80 FPS so a handy
uptick however using a combination of
ray tracing and DSS with this GPU
doesn't bring you back up to a level of
native rendering without DSS if you find
the rate traced global illumination
effect too subtle it's probably best to
just disable it and DSS and just render
the game natively obviously the quality
comparison is the key here the
immediately good news is DSS in Metro
Exodus is nowhere near as bad as in
battlefield 5 the implementation in
battlefield was blurry and looked like
rubbish it was far worse than even down
sampling the game but with Metro Exodus
at least with the latest patch DSS is
much clearer relative to battlefield 5
DSS is still not as good as native 4k
Metro Exodus I don't think anyone except
for invidious
Marketing team thought this would be the
case and it's certainly not even the
other demos I've seen 4k is sharper and
better preserves texture detail I
wouldn't say it's massively superior to
DL SS like it was in battlefield but
it's enough of an upgrade that remains
the premium way to play metro exits
although naturally you get an Associated
performance here the big question is how
DL SS compares to upscaling from 1800 P
which as we showed performs roughly the
same again with battlefield 5 this was a
universal win for resolution upscaling
over del SS with Metro Exodus it's not a
clear-cut win for either technique in
fact across most scenes I captured the
two options look extremely similar both
aren't quite as good as native rendering
both have some watts of sharpness in
detail both are somewhat softer than
native 4k there are some areas where DL
SS is sharper and presents a superior
image most of the time it's with static
elements like the watch and your
character's wrist and the main menu
these areas don't change much depending
on where you're standing so that's where
DL SS has an advantage trees are also
rendered perhaps differently is the best
way to put it there's less text to
detail in the branches but the branches
are also more pronounced and clearer I'm
sure some people will prefer the way
that looks and then there are some areas
where DL s s is not as good up scaled
1800 P does have better fine textured
detail in some areas which more closely
represents the actual textures being
used DL SS with its post processing
techniques to improve sharpness can
create a weird smeared look on some
textures you might not notice that if
you don't zoom in but it's an artifact
that I spotted DL SS is also more prone
to shimmering aliasing and other weird
artifacts again depending on the scene
these are issues that don't crop up in
static screenshot comparisons there's
only when playing the game and moving
around that you can spot these issues
sometimes it's distracting sometimes you
won't notice unless someone points it
out to you after closely examining a lot
of DL SS footage I'm getting the
impression that a post process
sharpening and noise reduction filter is
being used I don't have any insights
into the development process for meta
Exodus but I suspect the recent patch
that fixed DL SS has simply implemented
a sharpening filter to remove the blur
that plagued the early version you can
spot some haloing around objects which
is an artifact sharpening can introduce
well
increased shimmery and texture smearing
are also typical byproducts of post
processing techniques like sharpening
and noise reduction the salt assay
post-processing isn't a valid technique
if it improves image quality no one is
going to complain and typical
post-processing effects come in very
little performance cost however if a
filter has improved the quality of DL SS
rather than further training of the deep
learning system this would suggest there
might only be limited scope for further
improvements to image quality rather
than potentially massive improvements
like some people are suggesting as
possible we'll just have to see how that
one plays out over time one area I was
interested in was to see whether a
sharpening filter would also improve our
upscale 1800 P image like I think it
does with DSS upscaling currently does
not use any post-processing like this as
far as I could tell so theoretically a
developer could use a sharpening filter
plus upscaling
as an alternative to DL s s using a very
mild sharpening filter in conjunction
with 1800 P rendering just help to
increase apparent detail slightly and
remove some of the blur associated with
down sampling this is a common technique
that PC gamers already used
rishaad is already quite popular and
it's sharpening filters are often used
to combat the blur of anti-aliasing in
games with poor AAA so it's not
surprising to see post-process
sharpening working well with 1800 PT
rendering delivering at least in my
opinion a universally better image than
DSS with better apparent levels of
detail and fewer artifacts
moving onto 1440p at this resolution we
are forced to enable ray tracing to use
DL SS 1440p with ray tracing does
perform better than 4k native rendering
without ray tracing but the difference
isn't significant here we are once again
seeing DSS provide about a 21 percent
performance uplift at 1440p however this
is more in line with a 0.8 time shading
rate rather than 0.7 times like with 4k
gaming that's roughly equivalent to a
1290 P resolution at 1440p I feel the
difference between DSS and a 0.8 time
sharing rate is even more pronounced
than it was at 4k but maybe not in the
way you'd expect the areas where DSS is
superior to down sampling becomes even
more apparent at a lower resolution
trees are smoother and images noticeably
sharper in some areas however the issues
are also accentuated shimmering and
alias
is more noticeable plus I began to spot
weird blocky artifacts on some textures
using 1440p DSS that I didn't spot at 4k
the even lowest sampling rate available
to do SS @ 4k klouey has some
disadvantages for reconstruction and
noise reduction
I think DL SS looks better at 1440p
overall compared to at 4k but there's
still no clear winner in terms of down
sampling techniques each option has its
strengths and weaknesses while native
rendering is still overall superior so
when I began investigating TLS I wanted
to answer two questions does this
technology work and work as advertised
and is the technology necessary with
battlefield 5 the answer to both
questions was undeniably no the feature
blurred image quality so ultimately
didn't work very well which made it
unnecessarily compared to down scaling
techniques with Metro Exodus it's a bit
of a different story and I want to break
down what I think about each of these
questions we'll start with where the DL
SS works in this game specifically I
think it's fair to say DL SS does work
it's a one-click button improves
performance and the hit of visual
quality is pretty minor many people
won't notice some of the issues I've
been mentioning and what the image
quality isn't as groov native rendering
I think a lot of people will be more
satisfied playing their game with DL SS
enabled and a higher level of
performance than running with slightly
better sharpness at lower performance
however because it doesn't deliver
equivalent or better quality than native
rendering I don't think DSS works as
well as Nvidia initially advertised to
many of invidious initial documents
compared to DSS directly to native
rendering showing that DSS provided
higher visual quality I'm not sure how
many people bought into this but
certainly that hasn't materialized it
would have been black magic really to
have a feature that both looked better
than native rendering and ran better but
now we know that isn't possible at least
in the games and demos we've seen so far
the restricted nature of DSS is also
something that wasn't advertised and has
disappointed a lot of people hoping to
use the feature to enhance performance
for their specific setup 1440p gaming
with an RT X class GPU is quite common
but at this resolution you'll need to
enable ray tracing to also use TLS s
considering performance with ray tracing
disabled is better than RT x+ d OSS
performance I think for many gamers
choosing to forego RT
entirely in this game will be a better
choice especially if you don't really
notice the improvements that ray-tracing
brings arguably the more important
question is where the DL SS is necessary
at all even if it works if there's a
better technique that achieves the same
end goal then doesn't really make sense
for game developers to implement to your
SS and if it doesn't make sense for game
devs it doesn't make sense for NVIDIA to
work on the feature or use it as a
selling point for their GPUs aside from
marketing as you might expect from what
I've seen I don't think DL SS is doing
anything that another sub sampling
technique can't achieve in battlefield 5
any extremely basic upscaling with
superior and that's well it's not the
case with Metro Exodus 1800 P in this
game trades blows with 4k DL SS at the
same level of performance but 1800 P
with a subtle sharpening filter similar
to what it appears DSS is already doing
to improve image quality is universally
better than DL SS across the areas I've
tested in Metro so this begs the
question why implement DSS at all when a
developer could just use a combination
of upscaling
and post-processing to achieve at worst
the same results or at best superior
image quality it doesn't make a lot of
sense for developers to choose the more
restrictive DL SS option over something
that works with all GPUs including
invidious Pascal cuts and AMD cards and
at all resolutions and quality settings
it wouldn't even need to be complicated
to use it could be integrated as a
one-click button exactly like with DL SS
and it's clear that some developers are
already experimenting with techniques
equivalent to dialysis
even metro Exodus already includes a
scaling slider as do many other games
which admittedly many PC gamers don't
make use of and this is without going
into a discussion on even better
upscaling techniques like dynamic
resolution scaling which we've recently
seen used in apex legends with great
results or checkerboard rendering which
is improved in leaps and bounds for
console games and with further
refinement could be the overall best
option for PC games as well
I'm not saying DL SS can't improve over
time with faster Hardware more training
and more refinement yeah it could
improve but so can the multitude of
other options aiming to achieve the same
results dl says isn't specialist just
one of the many subsampling and
reconstruction techniques buying for
attention
this one is I guess garnered more
attention than usual because Nvidia used
it as a key selling point for the ITX
graphics cards when in reality it's not
really worth buying it true in GPU for
you should buy GPUs based on their
overall performance and value package
not niche and ultimately unremarkable
upscaling features as for Metro Exodus
itself this is the best implementation
of DSS I've seen and it's a feature
GeForce r-tx owners will be happy with
even if the developers had to resort to
post-processing effects to improve image
quality the results are quite
respectable and more in line with what I
was expecting from D LSS in real world
games but if you have a Pascal GPU a
Maxwell GP or something from AMD
I wouldn't bother feeling like you're
missing out because while it's good
again it really isn't anything special
that's it for my investigation into
Metro Exodus DSS we probably won't be
covering DL SS individually in future
games unless there's something new and
exciting to talk about if you know
future games come out with DSS looking
like what I've shown here in Metro
Exodus there's really not a whole lot to
add hopefully we see more
implementations like Metro rather than
battlefield but yeah who knows what will
happen as always you can subscribe for
