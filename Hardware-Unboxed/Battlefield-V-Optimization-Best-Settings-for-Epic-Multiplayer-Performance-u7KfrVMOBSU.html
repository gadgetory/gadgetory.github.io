lot of battlefield 5 testing on the
channel lately earlier in this week
Steve looked at how battlefield 5
performs with the range of GPUs then a
few days ago we looked at our TX
performance and hopefully we'll have
something up on CPU performance shortly
as well though with battlefield 5s and
knowing limits that might take a little
while but in today's video I'm gonna be
talking about how to get the best
performance out of battlefield 5s
regular settings without sacrificing too
much from visual quality similar to our
previous game optimization videos this
video is going to be slightly different
to our guides for games like shadow of
the Tomb Raider and Assassin's Creed
Odyssey primarily because those games
are single-player focused whereas most
people are buying battlefield 5 for the
multiplayer so the settings we're
targeting today I decided to create the
best setup for competitive play namely
high frame rates without the game
looking like a complete garbage where
possible so battlefield 5 is quite well
optimized so there aren't a lot of
settings where you can just tweak a few
things and get free performance a lot of
what we're going to talk about will come
down to trade-offs between quality and
performance unfortunately though it does
have that pesky 5 Hardware change limit
so this did limit the scope of their
testing a little bit that said we did
manage to test battlefield 5 across a
small selection of GPUs from both AMD
and NVIDIA and are both high end and
mid-range price points all testing was
done with our core i7 8700 K test system
overclocked to 4.9 gigahertz with 16
gigabytes of RAM and awful did you see
in this video is captured at 4k using
the GeForce r-tx 20 ATT I though do note
that the footage doesn't always
correspond to the exact areas we used
for performance testing all framerate
numbers you see are from the same
benchmark run noting that there's you
know no in-game benchmark in this game
we also tested in the single-player
campaign only this is because testing in
multi players are lot harder in fact
it's basically impossible for any sort
of repetitive
accurate testing but I did play a small
amount of multiplayer and the results
here do largely line up with what you'll
see in many of the multiplayer maps it's
also especially important to note here
we were GPU bound for basically all of
this testing in this sort of game though
not everyone will be GPU bound depending
on your CPU the framerate you're
targeting and whether you're playing
multiplayer a single player you could
run into CPU bottlenecks if you are CPU
bound you don't usually see a drop in
framerate
when you increase quality settings so
tweaking things for your setup is ideal
in that situation final note for this
video we recommend watching in 4k to
avoid YouTube's compression as much as
possible we do have a source quality
download available for our patreon stew
links to that in the description if you
want to see everything at a very high
bitrate so battlefield 5 is a fairly
simple game in terms of its quality
settings we have four basic presets
ultra high medium and low and nearly
every individual setting also has those
modes so when you set the game to ultra
every setting is set to ultra and when
you go down to medium all the settings
also go down to medium it's a nice and
simple system the two exceptions are the
anti-aliasing and ambient occlusion
settings those stick to ta a high + HB
AO respectively for every preset except
low where they go down to the lowest
setting before discussing the piece
that's in detail I do recommend a few
basic settings outside of the presets
for everyone to use DirectX 12 has a few
issues in this game so I'd recommend
sticking to DirectX 11 I'd also set the
frame rate limiter to its higher setting
of 200 and keep future frame rendering
set to on this is a bit of a weird
setting it does seem to reduce input lag
when vsync is enabled but for most
people I'd recommend vsync disabled in
this game and just let it run at the
highest framerate possible in the basic
settings I also disabled every effect
including film grain and depth of field
I think that's best for a competitive
multiplayer title with that out of the
way let's take a look at the presets
with cards like the AMD Radeon rx 570
delivering above 60fps at 1080p with the
ultra preset I reckon it's the go-to
here for most gamers that don't want to
optimize things further it looks great
everything is maxed out and it runs well
on mid-range Hardware that's the sign of
a well optimized title and dice it seems
to be delivering again here with
battlefield fight even 1440p gamers with
something like a gtx 1070 can
comfortably play above 60fps with the
ultra preset so yes
good one here I don't see much reason to
drop to the high preset there are some
slight visual changes like small
reductions to shadow quality draw
distance and foliage density but it's
not a huge downgrade then you move to
medium and you start to see some effects
falling away in particular the lack of
screens based reflections on water
puddles while low turns everything down
to poor quality for the best performance
looking at the performance breakdown
again I don't recommend using the high
preset because the performance increase
in most situations is only around 5 to
10 percent steve tested in a slightly
more demanding area than i did for this
benchmarking and found a higher margin
than this however i tested across
several different areas with wildly
different environments and the results
you see here are quite typical and this
makes sense because there's not a
massive difference in visual quality for
those who want more performance I just
go straight to the medium preset it
provides 30% more performance than ultra
and still looks ok I'd only recommend
the low preset for those with
entry-level Hardware struggling to play
at 60fps it doesn't look great though it
does perform pretty well now let's move
into the individual settings for a
better look and honestly there's quite a
lot of changes you can make here if you
want to target performance if you're
more after visual quality just slapping
an ultra and call it a day because
performance is pretty good if you have a
high refresh monitor and want to targets
a 100-plus FPS or just want the highest
frame rate for the lowest input latency
you'll want to use a combination of
ultra medium and even low settings to
hit those high frame rates without
having to resort to the potato quality
provided by the low preset first up we
have texture quality and this is a
setting that's a bit strange in
battlefield 5 it doesn't seem to impact
the quality of most textures
particularly those close to the player
but that can depend on the area there's
also some weirdness here where the game
uses very low quality textures for
things like static vehicle wheels and
wood but then high quality textures for
clothes and rocks this mixture means in
some areas the game looks great and in
others looks pretty bad I did spot a few
loading issues to wear high and low
quality textures are repeatedly swapped
it's a bit distracting and I hope this
is fixed in a patch in terms of
performance though a very simple quality
setting you want to chuck it on ultra
unless you have a mid-range card that's
starved of VRAM in some areas like snow
environments you do get higher quality
textures and it's worth it for most
players texture filtering is interesting
because this is another feature we
normally recommend people leave on the
maximum setting but in battlefield 5
there's very little visual difference
between any of the filtering modes at 4k
going from Ultra to low you'll only spot
a small reduction in clarity for a few
on-screen textures usually those are
weird angles and in the game where
you're running around pulling headshots
honestly you probably won't notice the
difference that said for those that do
want to preserve to extra quality I'd
keep it on an ultra but for anyone that
wants to target performance you can get
a healthy 3% boost to performance if you
chuck it on low which is my
recommendation here there's not a huge
quality difference between low and
medium so it's worth getting that extra
performance and just putting the setting
all the way down to low if framerate is
your thing lighting quality is an
influential setting when it comes to
performance as it controls the quality
of shadows the Ultra setting has the
sharpest densest shadows with the
greatest draw distance and then with
each quality setting drop all three of
those areas fall away when you get down
to the low setting shadow draw distance
for things like branches on trees is
pretty pathetic though it doesn't
completely get rid of shadows like the
lowest modes do in some games we're
looking at performance I almost have
three recommendations here Ultra has the
sharpest shadow so if you favor visual
quality it's the go-to but if you're
struggling for performance the first
change I'd make is to drop it down to
high your frame rate will increase by 5%
and the quality loss isn't significant
then for those targeting high frame
rates the medium setting is my
recommendation providing 7% more
performance than ultra with still
acceptable quality there isn't a large
enough jump to performance to justify
using low compared to medium at least in
my opinion effects quality is one of the
more subtle settings in the game and to
be honest I was only able to spot a
change moving from high down to medium
this setting appears to affect how point
lighting interacts with surfaces in the
world so on the high or ultra settings a
fire in front of a car can emit a glow
underneath the chassis for example this
car disappears when using medium or low
throughout our benchmark run we observed
a three percent uplift of performance
using the medium setting compared to
either high or ultra so dropping effects
down to medium is a good choice for
those targeting performance if you're
more after visual quality again just
chuck it on ultra post-process quality
is the most demanding setting in the
game as it controls where the screen
space reflections are applied to water
services such as puddles the main
difference I spotted was simply where
the SSR is enabled or disabled with the
medium and low settings SSR is
completely disabled which results in no
reflections on the surface of water
which is a massive visual downgrade
ultra and high has SSR enabled and
honestly I couldn't tell the performance
between them however there is a
performance difference between all four
modes which surprised me a little bit
what was especially surprising is the 2%
performance drop moving from ultra to
high normally you expect to gain
performance when decreasing a visual
setting but not in this case and i
triple-checked this result across
multiple areas so Ultra is the obvious
choice for those that want the best
visual quality if you want to gain a
significant amount of performance I'd
suggest chucking this setting on low
skipping medium entirely your frame rate
will increase by upwards of 15%
with this setting choice and while the
game doesn't look as good visually
without water reflections it's a really
handy way to up your frames per second
mesh quality isn't worth discussing as
it has no real impact on performance I'd
keep this one on ultra unless you are
running an entry-level GPU that is
struggling under a high geometry load
terrain quality is one of those settings
which has a nice balance between visual
quality and performance each of the four
modes does deliver a different terrain
quality level and each also comes with
the performance improvement Ultra has
the most dense terrain with the best
draw distance and each of these aspects
falls away with high and medium low
basically flattens the entire terrain
out so it's not a setting I'd recommend
looking at the performance breakdown
it's really a toss-up as to which
setting makes the most sense because
each comes with a different visual
quality those targeting quality we'll
want to keep it on ultra I suspect
though for the best performance I drop
it down to medium for a 2 to 3 percent
performance improvement in framerate low
does improve things again compared to
medium but the quality drop doesn't seem
worth the small improvement to
performance undergrowth quality like
terrain quality delivers a noticeable
quality difference but
in each of the four settings ultra has
the most dense ground-level foliage
while low removes a lot of the grass and
small plants around the environment note
that trees larger bushes and some of the
leaf particle effects are unaffected by
this setting what setting to use really
depends on how competitive you want to
be in my opinion those that want the
best visual quality should again off for
ultra because it delivers the most dense
environment but some enemies could be
partially obscured by the grass and
foliage elements introduced by higher
quality settings which would make them
harder to spot so for those that want to
go full competitive I would recommend
dropping this setting too low which I
guess you also pick up a 4% improvement
to performance in the process this is
really the only setting where the visual
quality change from dropping to a lower
setting could give you a competitive
advantage there isn't any other setting
that simply removes objects from the
game world it's probably only a small
advantage but I'm sure it's one that
some people would like to have for
anti-aliasing we have two modes both of
which use temporal anti-aliasing or taa
luckily taa has come a long way in the
past few years to the point where some
of the better implementations are
actually worth using in battlefield 5
the taa high setting does a good job of
smoothing out jagged edges without
destroying texture quality so it gets my
recommendation taa low noticeably blurs
the image and reduces texture quality
and as it only introduces a 4%
improvement to frame rate I wouldn't
bother using it the vinyl setting here
is ambient occlusion which impacts the
soft shadowing and the general depth to
the game world interestingly dice
provides an SSAO option but doesn't use
it for any of the presets instead
preferring HPA oh and that's for a good
reason as HPA o delivers more depth than
ssao
for a better image while off of course
removes ambient occlusion and leaves the
image looking a bit flat in terms of
performance impact opting for SSAO over
hpi-o delivers a performance improvement
below 1% so it's not worth using I would
however recommend switching ambient
occlusion off for those that want to
target framerate so after exploring all
the quality options it's nice to be able
to validate that yes the ultra quality
preset is in fact worth using for those
that want the best visual quality
there's no funny business here dice has
created a series of ultra settings where
the highest mode does in fact bring a
caller
humph often at little cost to
performance at a cost that's in line
with the visual improvement there are no
settings which unnecessarily tank
performance when you flick them up to
ultra and that's great to see especially
as the ultra setting does look pretty
great that said if you want to target
frame rate over visual quality there are
a number of tweaks I'd make rather than
simply sticking to the medium preset
which turns down settings like texture
and mesh quality unnecessarily for a
nice balance of performance and visual
quality I'd recommend the following
settings textures on ultra texture
filtering on low lighting and effects on
medium post process and mesh on ultra
terrain on medium undergrowth on low
anti-aliasing on TA a high and ambient
occlusion on HB a o these settings do
reduce the visual quality compared to
ultra but your frame rate also increases
by around 18% on average and with
undergrowth set to low it should be
slightly easier to spot enemies in
competitive multiplayer which is a nice
bonus considering it rinsed the world of
foliage density without r-tx 20 atti
this was the difference between playing
at mid to low 80s in terms of frame rate
and up around the 100 FPS mark at 4k
those would say at gtx 1060 are looking
at an extra 10 FPS at 1080p and it will
ensure a card like the gtx 970
stays above 60fps for those that really
want to target performance I'd suggest
to further tweaks setting post process
quality to low and ambient occlusion to
off those extra changes lead to a 45
percent performance improvement over the
Ultra preset which is perfect for high
refresh rate gaming placing it between
the medium and low presets in terms of
performance however it doesn't look
anywhere near as bad as the low preset
in fact it looks pretty similar to
medium but with better textures and
geometry and again reduced foliage
density for that potential competitive
advantage using these performance based
settings makes a card like and rx by
value suitable for high refresh rate
gaming at 1080p where it previously
struggled to hit 90 FPS using the ultra
preset it's now up over 120 fps and it's
a similar story for the GTX 10 70 at
1440p
which is great news for those that want
to game with high refresh 1440p monitors
that said in either case you'll need to
make sure you're not getting cpu
bottleneck
so yeah overall I'm fairly impressed
with the quality settings on hand here
in battlefield 5 the ultra preset is
decent you can turn off a few things to
gain large performance improvements
without completely destroying how the
game looks so depending on whether you
want visual quality or high frame rate
gaming there's something here for
everyone it's particularly nice that the
effects like explosions and particles
aren't heavily impacted by the quality
settings while typical settings like
textures and mesh quality can be kept at
high levels with little performance
penalty and of course if you're
interested in ray-tracing performance we
have a separate video that's already up
on the channel covering that we
recommend everyone leave rate rating
disabled though if you are serious about
playing this game a decent frame rates
especially even on the RT x20 atti
that's it for this quality optimization
