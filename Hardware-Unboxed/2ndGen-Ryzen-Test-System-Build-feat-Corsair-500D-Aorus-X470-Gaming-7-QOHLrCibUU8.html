the buzz around second gen rising right
now I thought it was about time to build
myself a test system so I can help out
Steve with future PC hardware coverage
I've actually never had a proper test
system of my own so with the launch of
new rising processes I thought there's
no better time to set myself up with the
latest gear before getting into the
awesome relaxing time-lapse of
constructing this PC I'll go through all
the hardware that I will be putting
inside the CPU is the Rison 520 600 X
and that's because we happen to have no
spare right now
AMD has promised Doukas up with a couple
more CPUs in the coming weeks and that's
when this build will be upgraded to the
Rison 720 700 X as its primary CPU
definitely will be handy to have both
but for now it will be twice 600ex
powered the motherboard I'm using is
none other than the gigabyte Boris x4 70
gaming 7 Wi-Fi when testing all sorts of
components we need a lot of features and
that's what this motherboard provides
there's a 10-plus two-phase vrm solution
with direct touch heat sinks dual em got
two slots
loads of USB ports including USB 3.1
gen2 type-c and of course you get RGB
lighting gigabyte also hooked me up with
the GPU the nvidia geforce gtx 1070 TI
windforce which will come in handy for
some types of game testing I want to do
down the track so stay tuned for that
I've got a few other GPUs around the
place here including that Vegas 64
behind me so it's probably about time to
build a GPU library in any case thanks
for gigabyte for sending out the gtx
1070 TI I think it's orange color scheme
on the cooler will blend in well with
the Auris I'm on the board for
everything else our good friends at
Corsair hit me up with a massive amount
of hardware so big thanks to them I'm
putting everything inside the Corsair
obsidian 500 d which is an awesome
looking case with tempered glass and our
minion Steve checked out this case
previously on the channel and he too is
using it for his test systems memory
wise quarter
okay today $100,000 budget and that was
just enough to get this one kit of 32 GB
of ddr3 thousand it's a 4 x 8 gig kit
and is their high-end vengeance early
date ramp are we putting all of this RAM
in the system today but the final
configuration will have just 16 gig of
it with the rest repurposed for my
editing rig and for storage we have the
Corsair force le 200 2.5 inch SSD in a
480 gigabyte capacity basically this is
just going to be used as a boot drive
and for a couple of other apps so that's
all I really need
of course power supplies are important
so I'm using the Corsair RM 850 X with
80 plus gold certification and low noise
output this 850 watt PSU will allow me
to put basically whatever I want in this
system and not have to worry about power
delivery within reason of course
including overclocking and all that good
stuff plus it's modular which is awesome
and finally we have cooling attached
straight to the CPU will be the corsair
h 115 i pro with RGB lighting of course
for those that haven't seen this cool
before it's a 2 80 millimeter
closed-loop liquid cooler and comes with
2 140 millimeter ml fans it will provide
a ton of cooling Headroom for at least
rise and processes then course they also
provided an additional 3 ml 120 pro RGB
fans for the case and a commander pro
fan and lighting controllers that's
basically all the bells and whistles
here's a quick summary slide that shows
off all the stuff that will be in this
test system so if I ever mention my rice
and test system in the future this will
be what's inside it if you need a quick
reference enough of all that good stuff
let's get right into the building
all right so you've seen the build now
everything is up and working so after
this I'll go install Windows do some
overclocking and all that good stuff I
reckon it looks awesome as well which
probably isn't necessary for a test
system but if there's ever an
opportunity to add RGB to a system for
no reason definitely take it again I'll
be using this system for a whole range
of testing in the future so stay tuned
for some of that it will definitely help
to ease
Steve's benchmarking load big thanks to
Corsair for providing a lot of the
components in this test system including
the case power supply memory storage and
cooling a huge shoutout as well to
gigabyte for the x4 70 motherboard and
gtx 1070 TI they've always been great to
us whenever we need hardware for our
test systems and of course thanks to AMD
as well for continuing to provide us
with all the rise and cpus we need for
the intel fans out there don't worry
i'll also be building an equivalent
intel test system in the coming weeks so
look out for that built on the channel
as well as always like this video if you
enjoyed it subscribe for more support us
on patreon if you feel like it and I'll
catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
