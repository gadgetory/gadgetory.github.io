we're looking at a GPUs once again and
in particular we'll be answering one
question I see pop up from time to time
do you need a Thunderbolt 3 port with
four lanes of PCI Express 3.0 or does
two lanes suffice for gaming this
question stems from the fact that not
every Thunderbolt 3 port is the same the
vast majority of Thunderbolt 3 ports
support the full capabilities of the
protocol in other words four lanes of
PCIe that use the full 40 gigabit per
second available to it some laptops in
particular those in Dells XPS line opt
for just two lanes of PCIe with reduced
bandwidth presumably as it's easier to
design for this we know that Thunderbolt
3 isn't the ideal protocol for external
GPUs with bandwidth and latency concerns
leading to reduced performance compared
to a pure PCIe connection so naturally
those that have purchased or want to
purchase a dell XPS laptop are wondering
whether the reduced bandwidth available
to each GPUs through just two lens of
PCIe leads to lower AGP performance then
fully fledged four-lane systems today
we'll be answering this question through
benchmarks of popular games as always at
hardhome unbox the setup we've got is
about as apples to apples we can get
right now
representing four-lane Thunderball 3
laptops we have the razor blade stealth
equipped with an intel core i7
8550 u + 16 gig of ram and in the other
corner of this battle representing
two-lane thunderbolt 3 devices we have
the Dell XPS 13 here we also have an
Intel Core i7 8550 U and we do move to a
gig of ram but this shouldn't make much
of a difference the key factor here is
we're using basically the same CPU but
one laptop uses four-lane Thunderbolt 3
and the other uses 2 lanes the e GPU
we're using is the Auris GT X 1080
gaming box one of the most powerful and
economically sensible options on the
market the GPU and he is pretty damn
fast but of course we aren't going to
harness the full power with either setup
that's just life with the GPUs right now
though in my opinion you can
you'll get decent gaming experience with
one depending on the title today we'll
be going through fourteen games and
comparing the performance between the
four Lane and two lane systems I've also
included results for other systems in
the charts but the main focus will be
the e GPU setups also I should point out
that all testing was done with an
external 1080p display hooking up and
displayed directly to the e GPU provides
the best performance so we've done that
here starting with Grand Theft Auto 5
here I tested at 1080p with the maximum
detail settings both setups are playable
with an average in the seventies and a
1% low in the 40s
however the four lanes setup is
noticeably faster here 2% faster and
averages and a decent 9% faster in 1%
lows this doesn't take the game from
unplayable to playable but an extra 4 or
5 fps is decent Batman Arkham Knight can
be difficult to play with game works
enabled but both systems push a 1% low
above 30 FPS at maximum detail levels
here still the falling setup is faster
to the tune of 16% on average and 10% in
1% lows this allows the game to reach a
60 FPS average on the 4 Lane razor blade
stealth rise of the Tomb Raider is
normally a punishing game and it's here
that the Fallen system holds a massive
performance lead in 1% loads the 4 Lane
system is 60% faster which is the
difference between 20 and above 30 FPS
in this metric at the maximum detail
settings with DirectX 12 enabled the
performance lead when looking at
averages is smaller at just 13% but it's
significant nonetheless it's clear in
this game that four lanes gives you a
better experience Deus Ex mankind
divided showed relatively modest
performance gains for the four lane
Thunderbolt 3 system at 6 percent on
average and 8 percent in 1% lows the
performance between each system here is
similar at around 50 FPS on average and
above 30 FPS in 1% lows so I wouldn't
worry too much about this game if you're
planning on playing it hitman is quite
CPU intensive but we're still seeing a
handy performance led to the four lanes
system despite the Dell XPS 13
outperforming the 4 Lane razor blades
stealth in general CPU benchmarks in
dead the blade stealth with its four
lanes of PCIe has a three percent lead
on average and eight percent in one
percent lows the game doesn't play well
on each GPUs with a 1 percent load below
30 FPS at maximum detail levels and
there's quite a large difference between
the average and one percent low results
which indicates some inconsistent
performance watchdogs 2 again is quite
CPU intensive but there's not a lot of
difference between the two
Lane configurations the four lane system
is 3% ahead looking at averages and 5%
faster in 1% lows using the ultra preset
at 1080p you'll only get just above a 30
FPS minimum so it's best to turn down
the quality for real gaming Mass Effect
Andromeda delivers similar performance
whether you have two or four lanes of
PCIe here the difference between the two
is only 3 to 4 percent which isn't that
significant and the game runs over 60
FPS on average anyway one of the better
experiences with each GPUs from what I
played which is a shame because the game
itself is pretty disappointing prey is
enormous Lee affected by the lane
configuration it's the biggest
difference you will see in this set of
benchmarks the four lane system is a
whopping 42 percent faster on average
and 37 percent faster when looking at 1%
lows clearly this game is quite
bandwidth intensive as performance
really suffers on the two-lane system
and that's a shame because the game is
very playable on a four lane Thunderbolt
3 solution Middle Earth shadow of war
shows a pretty typical performance
advantage to the four lane system 5%
looking at averages and 12% in 1% lows
with the GT X 1080 gaming box playing on
the ultra preset is possible though I'd
probably turn down a few things for
gaming with the tool and system just to
be on the safe side Assassin's Creed
origins with the ultra preset is not a
great experience with the GPUs with both
systems to living 1% lows below 30fps
the fauline system is 7 to 10 percent
faster in this game but in general
you'll want to turn down the detail
level on both systems to get that 1% low
frame rate at an acceptable level star
wars battlefront 2 is one of the rare
games where performance is actually
better on the two-lane Dell XPS 13 which
suggests the game is CPU limited aside
from some
on occasion the experience is quite good
in the single-player campaign with a 1%
low above 60fps still the thule system
is 7% faster in this test looking at the
1% lows which is pretty unusual
considering the other results things get
back to normal with battlefield 1 where
there is no significant performance
difference between the two and for
length Thunderbolt 3 systems looking at
the 1% low results the four-lane system
is slightly faster on average but the 1%
low results tell us more and here
there's nothing significant to report in
dirt for with the ultra preset used
again we're seeing the following system
are performed the two-lane system by a
decent margin 13% on average and 19% in
1% lows there are some odd periods to
slow down when playing to it for so be
aware of that when you're you know
playing this game on an e GPU but you'll
be better off with a four-lane solution
here if you are thinking of playing in
the final game we're looking at is
Wolfenstein 2 just to make those Vulcan
fans happy this is one of the larger
margins in favor of the four-lane system
at 20% in both average and 1% low frame
rates the Fallen system here runs above
60 fps almost all the time whereas the
two layer system doesn't hit that level
of performance using the mind Leoben
preset though you're getting a pretty
good experience
either way overall it's quite clear from
the games we looked at that the four
lane Thunderbolt 3 implementations do
have a performance advantage in nearly
every solution although the degree to
which four lenses faster does vary the
smallest margin we saw was about 2 to 3
percent in games like watchdogs 2 up to
20% or larger in games like Wolfenstein
2 and prey and of course there was that
one game Star Wars Battlefront 2 that
was a little bit faster on the tool and
solution on average the situation is
this four lane Thunderbolt 3 attached to
a new GPU is 10% faster than two lanes
when looking at average frame rates and
14 percent faster looking at 1%
those that's not an enormous difference
it's not a case of having double the
bandwidth with four lanes and therefore
double the performance but those tossing
up between a dell XPS laptop or a
competitor with four lens of PCIe might
be swayed by the extra performance of
the four lanes solution for a GPU gaming
that's it for this investigation into
one corner of external and graphics give
it a thumbs up if you liked it don't
