gigabyte GC X 1080 extreme gaming an
impressive GeForce GTX 1080 graphics
card boasting a massive cooler for some
of the lowest temps we've seen yet the
Xtreme also packed a fully redesigned
PCB which included a 12 phase power
design fed by a pair of 8 pin PCIe
connectors overclocked the gtx 1080
extreme gaming held a clock speed of 2.1
gigahertz under load which is about as
good as the 1080 overclocking seems to
get hot on the heels of the GD X 1080
extreme gaming gigabyte has released the
gtx 1070 extreme gaming which
unsurprisingly is pretty much the same
card for the GPU swapped out Nvidia did
this with their founders edition
graphics card and it seems gigabyte a
following suit with their extreme gaming
model as such I won't go into too much
detail about the cars design as this was
all covered in the previous video links
here in short the exact same colors been
used and the PCB design is also the same
with one key change the power phase
design has been downgraded from the 12
plus 2 design at the 1080 to a 10 plus 2
design for the 1070 the PCIe power
configuration has also been changed from
dual 8 pin connectors to a single 8 pin
along with a single 6 pin connector once
again those of you wanting to overclock
the GD X 1080 extreme gaming can turn to
gigabyte so an extreme engine software
which I found really useful when testing
the g1 gaming model the software enables
easy overclocking it allows the user to
increase the thermal target as well as
the power target the user can monitor
the GPUs vitals and easy overclocking
modes exist
along with the more complex manual
overclocking options voltage states can
be adjusted and custom fan curves can
also be created finally the
all-important RGB lighting can be
configured here and there's a few of the
more standard effects to play with when
it came to overclocking we were able to
increase the memory speed by 612
megahertz resulting in a total frequency
of 5400 megahertz
the core was pushed to a base clock of
1844 megahertz with a boost clock speed
of 1983 megahertz of course due to
invidious GPU boost 3.0 we know the card
can run faster than the suggester boost
clock if kept under the thermal and
power targets in the case of the extreme
gaming disallowed the card to hold an
operating frequency of 2113
megahertz after a 20-minute stress test
which was most impressive
so now let's jump to the benchmarks and
see how the extreme gaming got on then
first up is battlefield 4 we're at 1440p
the 10:17 extreme gaming managed six
more FPS than the standard founders
edition card it wasn't as much
overclocking Headroom though with both
cards overclocked the founders edition
1070 was only 2 FPS behind the extreme
gaming's 99 FPS average up next was Far
Cry primal where the extreme gaming
managed 66 fps this was 5 more than the
founders edition and just a single frame
faster with both cards in there
overclocked configurations in Star Wars
Battlefront the extreme gaming card was
this time 7 FPS faster than the founders
Edition card and two frames higher with
both cards overclocked this also allowed
the card to again leapfrog the 980ti
reference card the story was the same in
the division the extreme gaming card was
7 frames faster than its Nvidia
reference card and our overclock brought
it to within 4 FPS of the GD X 1080
founders Edition card in doom the
extreme gaming card was good for
silky-smooth 106 FPS with his factory
clock and 112 with our custom overclock
this was however the only game where it
wasn't able to defeat the overclocked
980ti though it was still very close in
our last game tested ARMA 3 none of our
cards tested were able to gain much
through overclocking the extreme gaming
card managed 70 FPS initially and then
72 FPS once overclocked which did still
put it a little ahead of the founders
edition the higher performance of the
extreme gaming card looks even better
when compared to the founders edition
card once you see how little extra power
is consuming to do so the standard
clocked card only used an average of
four more wads and once we have a clock
both cards the extreme gaming card uses
an extra six watts
nothing too surprising here and I'm
again impressed by the 10 70s
performance per watt in general like
gigabytes GT X 1080 extreme gaming card
the 1070 Edition has extremely
impressive thermal performance as you
can see on our graph it runs super cool
at 59 degrees standard and is 61 degrees
with our overclock applied this is
significantly lower than the founders
Edition card which was up around 77
degrees when I was working hard having
recently looked at and being very
impressed by the gigabyte GC X 1080
extreme gaming card I went into this
review with pretty high expectations and
overall they were met thanks for the
same beefy cooler found on gigabytes
1080 extreme this 1070
had no trouble dissipating what the GP
104 died threw at it running it
impressively low temperatures even went
overclocked
performance was great too out of the box
it was a healthy 9% faster than the stop
clock found edition 1070 which is really
nice this spinner was within 3% of our
overclocked 980ti reference card and
within 14% of the 1080 you found his
addition once overclocked we actually
weren't able to extract much more out of
this card than I found his Edition
counterpart however it did edged it out
by 2% this meant it was now 2% faster
than the overclocked 980 TI and within
nine percent of the stock clock GTX 1080
on average the overclocked config netted
a bonus 5% performance over the factory
clock and it did so at a much lower
temperature than the founders Edition
cards the cards don't seem to be
available in stores just yet but
hopefully there will be any day now and
hopefully there won't be too much of a
premium for those keen to get their
hands on one of the best board partner
GTX 1070 s going around
is this a 1070 card you'll be
considering let me know in the comments
