episode of unwrapping packages no
opening boxes what was this segment
called again I'm sorry kickstart this
episode we'll start with this box here
which looks to be wrapped in glad wraps
not sure why that is but anyway we'll
get into it and find out what it is it's
a heavy box quite a heavy box indeed
alright well we'll just cut through
everything and see what we find
scratch the box okay this is a brand I
haven't actually looked at before Drobo
tip the Drobo got it right well done
Steve one moment who skills okay so we
have the Drobo 5d USB 3.0 Thunderbolt I
believe I believe I believe I believe
yep
this isn't an ass it's a - so that's
direct attached storage not network
attached storage which means rather than
plug into a network and having a heap of
devices share the data right this is
designed to be plugged into one computer
and active a larger secondary storage
that also can be used to backup and
whatnot and obviously you can connect
that using a thunderbolt connection well
it looks like it may only be Thunderbolt
2 so this not sure how long this
products actually been in awhile for and
yeah USB 3 so not 3.1 gen2 so that's
interesting we'll have a quick look at
it anyway not sure how much like actual
factual information I can tell you about
this device apart from what's written on
the box
nope what's the grip just take it out of
this this shopping bag that it comes in
all right what's the pretty lights on
this one prepare yourselves here we go
mmm why does that rarely go to plan well
that's cool oh it has a magnetic front
cover so as you can see that just sucks
in the place that's cool and we have a
sticker behind it five three and a half
inch drive bays power switch power cord
fell out of the back now we've got a
green LED light for drive activity and a
whole heap of blue LED lights at the
bottom that indicates something that
we're yet to discover
so just to recap you can put five three
and a half inch hard drives in this then
they can be configured in various raid
arrays you can use that for backing up
or whatever I'm cheering raise five or
six is probably supported don't quote me
on that I'm sure one of them is so if
you do have one of the drives drop out
it will rebuild itself your data will
remain secure there's also in the bottom
I believe yes there is an M Certiport
and those drives are still relatively
easy to come by
so there you go M solder drive goes on
the bottom there and that's used for SSD
caching so not sure how much of an
impact that has on performance just
looking around the device so it must be
relatively old it's definitely not a new
product doesn't have funderbolt three
support only Thunderbolt two pair of
Thunderbolt 2 ports there as I set it to
the usb three specs oh not 3.1 gen2 so
that's a little disappointing I'm not
sure if there's a new model in the works
if there is I'm not sure why they would
have sent this out so late in the game
and yeah it is very pricey this unit
five hundred and fifty dollars u.s. or
seven hundred and forty dollars
Australian we
you can pretty much get a decent fall
Bay anyway Nath's for that price which
you know performance wise I imagine it's
fairly similar Gigabit Ethernet
connection often around that price I
think the four bays you can do things
like link aggregation and whatnot so I'd
like to actually hear what you guys
think would you consider something like
a desk or would you just get an ass
anyway since they're a lot more flexible
and can essentially do what a desk does
anyway I know qnap have recently put
their USB 3 copy feature that can turn
their nass into a desk so you can just
plug it in use it as USB external drive
so that kind of covers what this thing
does anyway - the Thunderbolt so yes let
me know what you guys think is a -
something you would consider anymore or
is it just like get an ass and be done
with it okay so that was interesting
different not the norm that's for sure
but what we have here is a box with GX
tape on it so that's got to be Galax so
I'm thinking a graphics card at sort of
graphics card shape and weight so we'll
see what they have for us I don't think
it's a 1080 TOI the box looks a bit too
small for 1080i but you never know it's
not a 1080 TI not hn 82 I can tell you
guys that much ah this is still very
very cool oh very cool indeed so it's a
10 17 you might be thinking not another
daleks 1070 but this one is the katana
model so that's a single slot gtx 1070
I've been dying to get my hands on this
ever since they announced that something
quite different
of course I'm definitely going to take
it out of the box and show you guys what
it looks like and I will definitely be
reviewing this hopefully I can get it
done next week alright actually quite
excited to see this
so we're setting up a high-end single
slot graphics card so strange
feels like a blast from the past seeing
a single slot graphics card wow that is
cool
so obviously a bit of a niche product
it's not something everyone's going to
be after it will have limited uses but
it will be useful in certain situations
very useful and it will do something
that no other card can do so really
where this will probably be most useful
there are mini ITX systems where you
know you can really only fit a single
slot card though they're few and far
between now most mini ITX builds all
cases are designed with dual slot cards
in mind so not super necessary for those
but larger micro ATX cases as well going
for larger micro ATX builds which sounds
a bit silly because you think it'd be
the smallest bill that would benefit
from these but the micro ATX builds
where you have the two PCI slots
expansion slots side by side most boards
have at least two with a dual slot card
you obviously wipe out the second one
that can't be used and the game is
that's not such a big deal except for
guys that want to use an extra adding
card to improve like a sound card for
example or maybe an nvme SSD on a
adapter card or you know additional side
of control or Thunderbolt 3 or something
like that whether I want to add a second
card this is where this becomes really
handy because the second card would sort
of probably goes something like that it
wouldn't block the fan that's still
quite a way back here so some sort of
second card you can put that in your
system and you have to sacrifice that
PCI Express slot so it's very cool so
although this model that I have here is
a galaxy branded card there alternate
brand for we have believe it targets
Europe the European market is KF a2 of
foam recalling correctly anyway both
Galax and KF a2
produced by palette anyway you will have
seen the GTX 1080 TI super jetstream
reviewed on the channel big beefy
graphics card so to make this graphics
card so thin one slot thin it's
obviously a completely redesigned and
custom PCB I believe it's a four plus
one vrm on this card which is still
plenty for a gtx 1070 and something
interesting that you all know around at
the io end that we have sacrificed i
think it's two of the display port
connectors here we have one display for
one HDMI and one jus link DVI so you can
still have triple monitors off this card
but you have to use obviously those
connections and then they are claiming a
base operating frequency of fifteen
hundred and eighteen megahertz which
results in a boost frequency of
seventeen hundred and eight megahertz so
that should allow for some decent
performance out of this single slot card
anyway I won't go on about this too much
I'm actually keen to jump in the review
and testing of this thing and see how it
actually runs so there will be a review
on this on the channel within the next
week or so quite a few things coming up
but yeah I'll squeeze this in because I
am keen to check it out for myself
and as I speak right now pricing isn't
available in the US I believe at the
moment six hundred Australian for this
particular model but availability is
still very poor so expect pricing to
improve as availability improves okay
next up we have a rather large box from
MSI actually I think I know what this is
this could be very cool as well okay
it's a black box with msi written on it
nope still no closer actually here we go
this is what it is it is a laptop you
guys would probably guessed that by this
point sure the suspense was just killing
you but here we go
laptop woo rather impressive little
laptop oh there we go the power adapter
alright I'll get a lot off this table so
you guys might be wondering what are you
doing with a laptop Steve this is
definitely Tim's department well I'm not
stepping on Tim's toes with this one now
the reason I have this brand new MSI gs4
heat-ray laptop is because I will be
taking it to Computex
that's right I'm going to compute X this
year for Hardware unboxed so very
excited about that
MSI has been kind enough to sponsor the
channel so thank you very much MSI and
they've also provided a laptop so I can
edit videos and all that sort of stuff
while I'm over in Taiwan and so I'm
going to read directly off the box
because I actually have no idea what is
in this apart from the fact that it does
have a seventh gen Core i7 processor and
a geforce gtx 1060 probably all you
really need to know so the core i7
processors in the 7700 HQ it's the six
gigabytes gtx 1060 it has a one terabyte
hard drive a 256 gigabyte SSD 16
gigabytes of ddr4 memory and the rest is
pretty standard stuff so a decent laptop
for sure very nice and compact very
light one thing though it is a 14 inch
panel which isn't too much of a problem
for video editing though it is only a
1080p display so that's that could be a
bit difficult for the videos I'll test
it anyway and see how I go but that's
what I have for the moment anyway so
Computex starts in about a week and a
half and obviously I'll be using this
for creating my videos while I'm at
Computex so but before then I am King to
give do a bit of benchmarking on this
see how well it does perform in Premiere
so do some premiere venture marks and of
course with the gtx 1060 you know
they'll be some gaming benchmarks as
well hopefully i'll be out of squeezing
and some gaming while i'm over there I'm
likely back you know nice to think that
I could
so yeah more to come on this laptop for
sure
see you there I'm got to love the way
the laptops get passed around so many
reviewers this thing is very grimy MSI
could have cleaned it up for me I'll let
them off on that one
no I'll give it a cleanup in a minute so
MSI laptop now we have just one last
package very small one and I have opened
this already and a peek inside but I
wasn't sure if it was related to the
hardware box channel and it is so in the
last episode of unboxing boxes you would
have seen me unbox the master liquid
protocol of the two 18 millimeter
radiator couple of you pointed out that
generally doesn't come with the am for
mounting gear and you were spot on it
doesn't so cool a master sent that along
separately so hopefully you guys who are
owed a am for mounting kit will have
them before too long because cool master
clearly do have them not a lot to it
really just two brackets that obviously
allow to be installed on an AM 4 socket
and a couple of screws and things which
I'm not sure if they're different to the
ones that you will have received with
the 288 I but you've got those so
speaking of which I will have that
cooler master build ready hopefully very
soon on the channel a couple of days
time depends on how we go with the
schedule and what I have planned but
I'll give you guys a bit of a look at
what I've done so far it's not what I
planned so let's just say that if you
guys recall I unboxed the mastercase 5 T
in the last episode and that is a
phenomenal case it's got the dual
tempered glass panels on either side
it's got the red accents inside the red
painting that looks cool for the
motherboard tray and there's a few other
bits and put some red on the front looks
really really cool except I am going to
do a rising 5 build in it a high and a
1600 X build and I know AMD's color
scheme is red black red and it's kind of
the common thing
the common build theme I should say
whereas the boxes and rise ins color
scheme seems to be more orange and grey
so I thought why not paint the case
orange and possibly gray gray wasn't
really planned I thought I just got
orange and black and then you give me a
spray can and things just get out of
hand
and yeah a few you guys are following me
on Twitter will have seen the
monstrosity but quite a few of you seem
to like it I'll grab it now and show you
so there you go surprise it's um it's
very out there so unfortunately the gray
I ended up using is a lot lighter than I
should have used as you can see here
should I go with a lot darker grey the
orange I managed to get pretty close
it's pretty close to the orange so I
think the orange color is acceptable but
the gray is a bit light but that's quite
a few of you pointed out it actually
looks like an overwatch build so maybe I
might have to incorporate that into it
somehow yes I swear we're up with that
you know how well you guys can see that
I have to get some extra b-roll there's
the front door so I'm pretty happy with
how to come up actually you've got the
UM seat on the bottom so I've um and
then there way you can see the
motherboard up there but I've also
custom painted the motherboard and the
memory and a few other bits and pieces
so okay that should um
that should be quite an interesting
build I haven't gone that over the top
on a build before but yeah I'm quite
happy with how it's all come up the
paint I use was really cool I'll
probably talk more about that in the
actual build video anyway so that's
that's coming up shortly that bill so
that'll be cool and now I finally have
the mounting bits so I can actually
start the build and finish the build so
that pretty much does it for this
episode I am very keen to check this out
though that's a sweet looking little
graphics card there as I said obviously
you've got to have a need for it it's
kind of a niche product it's not going
to suit everyone it will be for very
particular bills so that's going to do
it for this episode of unboxing boxes we
had a turbo death and I'm really keen
before I even think about reviewing this
what you what you guys think of a -
these days whether they're worth
especially expensive ones like this like
$550 u.s. that's a lot of money for add
us and I'll put the funderbolt support
but it's fun them up to now so how
useful is that then this graph is cut
which I'm pretty sure that will pan out
very nicely as will my coolermaster
build which has gotten a little out of
hand let me know what you guys think of
it as I know it's a bit game rash a bit
childish almost and it's probably not
something I would normally use that I've
kind of grown fond of it kind of like it
it's cool because well first of all I
did it myself so it's always nice to mod
something yourself and say that you've
done it yourself but it's also one of a
kind as well so that's also pretty cool
not always a good thing but anyway let
me know what you guys think so yeah bit
of a rush Depa so here apologies for
that it's going to be a things are going
to be a little bit rushed on the channel
for the next week until I get to
Computex there's a lot of things I have
to get ready and sorted out that's sort
of taking away from the creation of the
videos I don't even have much to unbox
this time anyway so don't know how long
this episode went for but it was a bit
of fun and got some cool gear that I'm
keen to check out so that's it for this
episode of unboxing boxes I'm your host
Steve see you again next time guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
