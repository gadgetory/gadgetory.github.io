today it's monitor review time and this
particular model I'm looking at today
has been reasonably heavily requested by
our patreon members as well as a few
people via email not sure what was going
on there anyway it's the pixie opx 275 H
a highly affordable semi high refresh
1440p gaming monitor with a bit of wide
gamut and HDR thrown into the mix I was
very impressed with the previous pixie
monitor I reviewed so I was pretty keen
to get this new release in my office for
some testing so let's run through the
details 27 inches in sight is 2560 by
1440 resolution and it uses a flat IPS
panel maximum refresh rate is 95 Hertz
minimum is 30 Hertz so we also get free
sync with low framerate compensation and
great support with both AMD and NVIDIA
GPUs it's a wide gamut panel with 95%
DCI p3 coverage and its HDR ready
although there's no true HDR support
here as I'll get to later the key
feature here is the price of just 260 US
dollars through Amazon this is basically
the perfect price for these specs we
have entry-level 1440p 60 Hertz monitor
sitting around $200 these days and then
you start seeing higher 144 Hertz
refreshes at $300 in both curved and
flat TN and VA options with IPS variants
often another step above in price tag so
what the pic co px 275 H is offering is
really a unique middle ground between
entry-level 1440p and true high refresh
1440p compared to the standard 1440p 144
hertz $300 options the only major
compromise here is in the lower refresh
rate of just 95 Hertz unlike a lot of
other budget 1440p displays we're still
getting a high quality IPS panel with
great color support its position well
for gamers that don't quite have the
cash on hand for the $300 plus models
but still want to get into 1440p gaming
without having to suffer through sixty
Hertz refresh rates or crappy tea and
displays I can definitely see why this
monitor in particular has generated a
lot of buzz right now right out of the
box unfortunately not a good start for
the PX 275
eh my retail unit shipped with a set of
bent legs something I haven't
encountered before and really surprised
me consuming the strength of the metal
used and a lack of damage to the box I
believe this was simply a manufacturing
issue that wasn't picked up in quality
control and not sure I really blame them
too much given issue is hard to spot at
first glance in fact it wasn't until I
was completing the review process that I
noticed the issue anyway sometimes you
run into issues like this actually
buying these products in the real world
which is why I've talked about it here
picks yo were quick to send out a
replacement stand so that should arrive
soon and luckily the monitor is still
usable as it is right now as I mentioned
I was surprised to see the stand come
bent because it's made using a strong
sturdy metal and visually it looks quite
good even with the bends there's still
very little wobble in the construction
although there's limited adjustability
only tilt is supported if you need to
adjust the height or swivel it around
you'll want to buy a stand that's
compatible with the vase and mount on
the rear aside from the stand rest of
the design is simple effective and in my
opinion looks pretty good
nothing crazy in terms of RGB lighting
or gamer design elements just a basic
black plastic construction with a
minimalist rear that gives most of the
attention to the 27-inch screen on the
front slim bezels a few small logos and
moderately thin builds and that's about
all worth mentioning the one major
omission is the directional toggle pick
cor continuing to use a row of buttons
along the bottom right edge which makes
the on-screen menu hard to navigate
there aren't a ton of features in the
menu most of the options are for color
and image controls which are set and
forget type stuff but the HDR toggle and
crosshair options are things you might
want to toggle on and off from time to
time let's talk about performance
starting with the refresh rate 95 Hertz
is a little unusual it's not a typical
refresh rate we see but it is notably
higher than 60 Hertz and even 75 Hertz
which are the refresh rates that
dominate budget 1440p offerings to me
95 Hertz is noticeably smoother than
either of those low options while 144
Hertz is another step above with that
said 95 Hertz is a lot closer to 144
Hertz than the 60 Hertz in terms of how
smooth games feel and really at around
this Mark II getting many of the
benefits that high refresh rates bring
just not to the level that your premium
offerings deliver the other huge benefit
having this monitor
refresh at 95 Hertz is proper low
framerate compensation support many 75
Hertz and 60 Hertz monitors in fact most
on the market do not support LFC which
severely limits the usefulness of
variable refresh rates it can be quite
jarring to jump in and out of the
supported refresh rate window but this
isn't an issue whatsoever with the px
275 H as it supports LSA and that means
the gaming experience is rock-solid be
sure to turn on free sync in the monitor
settings though it is disabled by
default gaming performance is backed up
by strong response times falling right
in the typical zone for an IPS display I
recorded a greater great average of six
point five four milliseconds using the
middle response time setting which
offered the best balance between quick
responses and minimal overshoot this
doesn't make it the outright fastest IPS
I've reviewed but it's right around the
mark for a gaming grade panel and is one
to two milliseconds quicker than VA
options and that 95 Hertz or responses
are well within the refresh window so
there's nothing to worry about there
this display does work as advertised
also good to see is minimal input
latency of around 3.2 more seconds which
again is right around the mark of other
gaming grade monitors it's rare to find
a gaming monitor that suffers in this
department but once again no problems
with how the px 275 H performs in this
regard where the PX 275 h falls away is
in the standard area most budget gaming
monitors struggle with and that's color
performance pick CEO has made no attempt
to factory calibrate this display so my
unit arrived with a moderate green tint
across the grayscale range this throws
up the CCT curve as you can see and when
combined with incorrect gamma leads to a
high Delta a average of eight point zero
three which is far from accurate and
then for saturation performance and
incorrect white point is mixed with an
unclamped gamut to again produce a high
Delta a of five point seven nine
there's no srgb toggle in the settings
so unless use the software profile you
will always get over saturation when
viewing srgb content which is still the
majority of modern imagery that's one of
the downfalls of a wide gamut gaming
monitor and some pretty common issue and
again we see a high Delta average on
5.99 in color check again due to the
combination of factors well this is a
poor result out of the box the benefit
to having an IPS display is it's highly
tuneable and can often
corrected without much drama in fact
with just a few OSD tweaks I was able to
achieve strong greyscale performance
with a correct white point and good
performance throughout the range as seen
in that sub 1.0 Delta average which is
perfectly accurate
I don't expect every px 275 H to ship
with a green tint but I should be able
to bring whatever white point they end
up with back to an accurate position
using either a white reference or
calibration tool unfortunately there's
not a lot you can do to correct the over
saturation issue which is why Delta is
in our color tests are still above 2.0
and average performance U is good and
will be fine for those that like a bit
of unnatural vibrance to their image but
if you want accuracy you'll need to take
it further with a full calibration and
once you do that as expected you get
perfect performance all of this is down
to the IPS panel to begin with pulling
these sorts of displays back to an
accurate level is often easier and more
achievable than with VA or TN at least
in my experience however as it requires
a software profile you left with all the
usual issues like limited compatibility
as always the profile we created is
available for our patrons
although juda panel variants the profile
won't be accurate for everyone I should
make note here though that after fixing
the white point using OSD tweaks wide
gamut DCI p3 performance is very
accurate so if you are if you are
working with DCI p3 content this is a
great result in terms of brightness my
unit peaked at 430 nits or there abouts
although that drops somewhat after
calibration for contrast by default we
get a 10 20 to 1 ratio which is bang on
a typical IPS and of course well below
VI panels this drops slightly to 942 one
when a calibrated however average
contrast is made up for with excellent
viewing angles and a flat display which
I prefer over curved in this 27 inch
form factor uniformity is also a
better-than-average with this monitor
the center zone is extremely uniform
much more so than most gaming monitors
however this fall's away going along the
top edge
despite this you're getting a generally
uniform image here which you can't
guarantee with VA or TN panels in
particular I'll make a brief mention of
HDR support here at the end as well it's
not a major selling point of this
display but pic co does advertise this
as HDR capable and indeed it can accept
HDR inputs as you can see in our HDR
a checklist it fails two of the three
key pillars for true HDR support while
sustained brightness of over 400 nits is
good peak brightness is low and that's
combined with no local dimming so the
contrast delivered by this monitor is
simply too weak for proper HDR content
with that said I don't really care about
the HDR performance because we're not
paying extra for HDR it's not display
HDR certified at all and it's only a
minor note on the product page in fact
pic co gets pretty close to delivering a
good wide gamut only experience through
the HDR toggling windows it just falls
slightly short of being properly usable
which is better than I can say for most
monitors that support HDR so you've
reached the end of the video and you're
here for some overall thoughts well
firstly I think this is a really good
concept for a budget gaming monitor take
a high-quality IPS panel with great
color support and instead of offering it
at 144 Hertz you shape off some of the
refresh rate and offer it at 95 Hertz if
you're going to make a compromise to
bring the price down I think this is one
of the better choices to make pick cos
execution of this concept is generally
pretty good aside from the quality
control issue with my review unit that I
don't expect most buyers to run into the
only major issue I had is a standard one
for entry level gaming monitors and
that's a lack of calibration which means
it ships with poor color performance out
of the box but because it's an IPS panel
it is relatively easy to fix aside from
that pixie o ticks a lot of boxes great
response times and input latency proper
adaptive sink support with low framerate
compensation excellent viewing angles a
basic yet attractive design and the fact
it's wide gamut with 95% DCI p3 coverage
is a neat bonus the price tag as well I
feel is excellent 260 dollars is a great
position for this display to sit and
allows it to be laser focused on buyers
that want a gaming grade 1440p monitor
but don't have 300 to 350 dollars to
spend
I still think those more expensive 144
Hertz options do offer enough to justify
the higher price but this new pic serial
monitor is pretty much the best you can
get for around two hundred and fifty
dollars it's is encroaching as well on
the territory of your $200 1080p 144
Hertz monitors so it's great to see
higher resolution is really challenging
those budget offerings for the first
time unfortunately pixel monitors are
only available in the United
States which continues to annoy me
because this is the second time I've
been really impressed with their
offerings but at least if other versions
using this panel become available from
other companies and other territories
you will know what to expect that's it
