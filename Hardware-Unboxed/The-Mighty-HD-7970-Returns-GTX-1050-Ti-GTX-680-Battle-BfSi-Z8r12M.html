today's video is an update of a video I
did back in November if you recall I
checked out if in videos new geforce gtx
1050 TI graphics card had the measure of
2012's flagship gtx 680 weeks prior to
creating that video I was benchmarking
with the new titanfall 2 game and I
noticed well benchmarking that the 1052
I was actually able to match the
performance of the gtx 680 in that title
so out of interest i looked a bit
further into some other games to see how
the two compared and i found that
actually overall the 1052 I was slightly
faster and this is despite featuring 33%
fewer cuda cores the 1050 Ti is of
course based on a much more refined
architecture Pascal is considerably more
efficient than Kepler so the 1052 I
might have fewer cores but the cause it
does have are able to get more done and
they're also clocked higher for good
measure anyway in that video heaps of
you asked me to retest with the Radeon
HD 7970 included well actually okay so
from the 500 plus comments like two of
you asked for a retest but whatever I
thought it was a good idea so here we
are complementing the games tested
previously I've thrown in some oldies as
well the Tomb Raider reboot along with
Sleeping Dogs has been added this takes
the total games tested to eight all
three graphics cards have been tested IR
core i7 6700k test rig using the latest
available drivers so then on to the
benchmarks first up we have f1 2016 and
this was one of the games tested
previously whether 1052 I was a good bit
faster than the GTX 680 here you can see
the newer budget GP was 12% faster when
comparing the average framerate although
the minimum frame rate for the 7970 was
slightly lower than the 680 it pulled
ahead for the average this meant the
1052 I was just 4% faster than the 7970
when comparing the average frame rate
that's what I should note that it was
also 23% faster when comparing the
minimum frame rate the 1052 is able to
slightly improve upon the GTX 680 m
Mirror's Edge catalyst
however when compared to the 79 7
it was 10% slower and we see here that
AMD's flagship GPU from 2012 runs away
with it rendering 73 FPS on average for
those of you keeping score at home this
meant the 7970 was 14% faster than the
680 generally speaking overwatch plays
slightly better on NVIDIA Hardware and
here we're seeing that still with the
ultra quality preset in place the 7970
turned out an average of 100 FPS this
meant the 680 was 11% faster while the
1052 I enjoy a 13% performance advantage
what about 2016 s most epic title
battlefield 1 well here the 7970 was
good for 50 FPS on average making it 6%
slower than the 680 when compared to the
1050 CI the 7970 was 14% slower though
it was just 4 percent slower comparing
the minimum frame rate this is another
title developed closely with Nvidia so
it's not entirely surprising that 680
comes out ahead of the 7970 here that
said the margins were extremely slim the
680 was just 5% faster when comparing
the average frame rate the 1052 on the
other hand was 18% faster you can
probably thank driver optimization for
that the GTX 680 and 1050 Ti provided
very similar performance when testing
with titanfall 2 both average 62 fps
this made them 6% slower than the 7970
which average 66 fps that is a solid
result for AMD's almost five-year-old
graphics card like the GTX 680 and HD
7970 sleeping dogs was released back in
2012 comparing the three GPUs in this
game shows fairly similar performance
across the board the GTX 680 was 4% fast
in the 79 70 for the average result but
7 percent slower for the minimum
meanwhile the 10 52 I delivered a strong
average result with a weaker than
expected minimum this isn't this year's
rise of the Tomb Raider but rather 2013
s reboot with tress-fx enabled you could
argue that AMD has an advantage here but
we also test The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt
with hair works enabled for the most
part so you'll just have to deal with it
even if things do get a bit hairy
anyway the 7970 was just a single frame
faster on average than the 1050 Ti
that was 3 FPS faster when comparing the
minimum frame rate finally we have the
total system power consumption figures
and this is where the real gains have
been
made the core i7 test system consumed a
hundred and sixteen what's with the 1050
Ti handling the rendering work that's
almost half the power consumption of the
680 while it's less than half of that of
these 7970 looking back it doesn't seem
like the GTX 680 or the 1050 Ti got
trashed by the 7970 like many viewers
suggested it would have in the previous
comparison video in fact once we tally
up the numbers we find some very
interesting results I'm sure some of you
won't believe me but on average the 680
and 7970 delivered the exact same
performance in the eight games tested
they both came out with an average of 71
FPS while the 1050 TI node to head with
74 fps
so what about the minimums though well
again there wasn't much in it the 1050
TI and 7970 both averaged 56 FPS while
the 680 was just 1 FPS slower honestly
these results aren't at all surprising
earlier this year we created a video
that compared the 680 and 79 70 and nine
new games as well as 9 old games AMD and
NVIDIA traded blows in both the new and
old titles to live a similar performance
overall finally I'd just like to point
out that I'm not trying to paint the GTX
1052 as an amazing graphics cart with
this video it's simply a look at where
we are now and what we've come from the
GTX 1050 Ti isn't the best value sub
$200 GPU we've already awarded that onto
the RX 470 all the r9 to know if you're
willing to go second hand and take a big
hit on power consumption the reason we
use the 1052 is the test subject is
simple it's the most recently released
GPU making it a bit more of a hot topic
personally I really enjoy these new and
old comparisons and I know although you
guys do as well so be sure to let me
know what you thought of the results in
the comments below and if you have any
ideas for comparisons I could make in
the future be sure to let me know those
as well
anyway that's it for this one guys
thanks for watching I'm your host Steve
and I'll catch you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
