PC building not just any old PC as I'm
sure many of you are painfully aware of
by now building a new PC or even
upgrading an old one is no easy task
with heavily inflated memory and
graphics card prices we've covered the
situation in quite a bit of depth on the
channel over the past few weeks and the
only real solution that we've been able
to come up with for would-be buyers is
to wait just wait that's really all you
can do now and while it seems a bit
hopeless mmm yeah okay I'm not even
gonna try and sugarcoat it and maybe
next week I'll try and devise a few
cunning strategies for viewers but for
now I think I'm just gonna employ the
Lynas technique this involves creating a
hideously overpriced computer that
almost no one on the planet is ever
going to build safely that turns out to
be a lot of fun I should note that
although I'm not gonna even bother
trying to attempt to pass this off as a
serious build a number of the components
are we using are genuinely good or at
the very least unique and interesting so
what we're building today is an extreme
and I mean extreme sky like X Mini ITX
system and if it wasn't obvious the
title was a bit of a joke
this would be a ludicrous home theater
PC but it could certainly be used for
that purpose if you wanted what you
would use it for well that's up to you
and your imagination to work out okay so
as for the specs at the heart we are of
course using the Intel Core I 979 ATX II
it seems like the go-to option for
youtubers making ridiculous builds at
the moment so I wanted to get in on that
action for those of you unaware this is
an 18 core 36 thread high-end desktop
processor that costs a cool $2,000 us
and well that's probably all you really
need to know making it possible to cram
this beast into a mini ITX enclosure is
the highly unique as rock X 299 II ITX
AC the only X 299 Mini ITX motherboard
in existence
priced at $400 us it's all
so the most expensive mini ITX
motherboard to ever exist however this
niche product is very awesome offering
extreme horsepower in a small form
factor and when compared to almost all
micro ATX boards it's actually better
stopped as rocks manage to include a 7
phase power design sporting 165 watt TDP
processes which of course includes the
18 core monster that will be using quad
channel memory support also exists and
the board can support up to 64 gigabytes
of memory jewel band wireless AC jewel
Gigabit LAN six SATA ports and three m2
ports along with loads of USB 3 ports
can be found on board as well when it
comes to overclocking this little
attacker has plenty of headroom as well
you'll get a 10 core 20 thread core on
own 1700 X to around 4.5 gigahertz
without much trouble that said there if
you want to overclock the big boys as
rock has come up with a solution and
that solution was to team up with bits
power this partnership has developed the
ASR X 299 AI RGB nickel mono block and
what a thing of beauty is as you would
expect this mono block not only cools
the CPU but also replaces the small vrm
heatsink offering far better cooling
performance the massive block is
constructed from copper so it is quite
heavy the block has been given a durable
nickel finish in silver while the top
cover is made from acrylic though much
of that cover is covered by a thin
aluminium panel which looks quite good
for those of you wondering the mono
block costs one hundred and seventy
dollars EOS along with the mono block we
were also provided the bits power
Leviathan slim at 240 millimeter
all-in-one liquid cooler kit valued at
$190 us now we could have gone with some
crazy custom liquid cooling bits here
and spent significantly more money and
time but for now this powerful yet
simple all-in-one solution will do
nicely
it makes for a quick and easy install or
at least I hope it will in our case
which is the fantex and through evolve
shift X I'm not entirely sure how we'll
go stuffing all this hardware into this
stretched out mini ITX tower but we're
certainly going to find out in a moment
also provided for this build is G skills
new Ripjaws ddr4 3800 laptop memory
because the asrock mini ITX x2 iron
board still supports quad-channel memory
operation it had to use laptops odom
modules typically this would limit you
do lower frequency memory but not in
this case of course you can't expect to
pay a pretty penny and we found online
for $515 us for the 32 gigabyte kit
that's the very same kit that we'll be
using the awesome thing about this stuff
though is that you can simply load up
the XMP profile on the ASRock x29 8i TX
AC and you're away the 79 80 XC can now
enjoy memory read and write speeds well
in excess of 80 gigabytes per second
pretty incredible stuff so I can't wait
to get building before I do though here
is a quick look at the full specs
breakdown of everything going in to this
wallet-friendly rig that's an
eye-watering total build cost there and
that's assuming that the RX vega 64
liquid graphics card was purchased at
the $700 u.s. MSRP which obviously isn't
going to be possible right now and in
fact since release seeing one selling at
the MSRP has been an extremely rare
occurrence since some 1080 T eyes are
selling for around $1,000 u.s. right now
it's fair to say for a high-end video
card you can tack at least another
thousand dollars onto the total build
cost and that would push us over $7,000
us in total anyway enough talk about
crazy high prices
let's just get building
you
okay so time for a quick pause as I run
into my first page of problem I don't
believe there's an easy way around it at
least not with keeping the components
that I definitely want to feature in
this build it is possible to fit a 240
millimeter rat along with a 120
millimeter rat in the shift X case but
there's only enough room if I believe
the rads could probably be up to about
25 millimeters thick and not the 30
millimeters thick that we have on the
bits power all in one liquid cooler
you'd also need to use an SFX power
supply or not a full-size ATX power
supply well when I say full size it's an
ATX form power supply but it is only the
160 millimeters tall that is supported
by the case so technically it does fit
but it's far from ideal and you can't
really use the cases cable management
features with a power supply that length
because it covers the hole here in the
case whether the cables were out up
through here and then come in so I'm
just got as you can see here an absolute
mess so that was a mistake I should have
got an sfx power supply I do have plenty
of them laying around and I could change
that out to an sfx unit if I wanted to
but it's not really going to matter
because I can't fit this guy in there no
matter what power supply you use and
that is because of the radiator I cannot
physically fit this guy down here so
obviously with an SFX power supply that
would afford me a bit more distance here
so that would fit in but it's not going
to fit under this unit here it's simply
too thick to get in there so I could
move this up a little bit more but then
I have the problem of the pump and
reservoir which is ultimately the
biggest problem I have here because if
you put in a full length graphics card
like this you can see that it's going a
hit
quite clearly the pump and reservoir I
can move this bracket over here a bit to
put the card here so it'll go past the
radiator but it's going to hit the pump
and resevoir there so there's just no
way to get that in there unfortunately
so that's left me with a bit of a
problem of how I get a graphics card in
this system because my main
concern is getting the cooling in there
because it's really all about that 18
core CPU but I still wanted to have a
decent graphics card coming just before
I do get to the graphics card some of
you guys are probably saying well you
could flip this upside down and yeah the
reservoir would be upside down you have
to flip the whole case over to it if you
ever wanted to top it up one option
would be there to flip this upside down
have the pump and reservoir down here
which would be ideal and I hadn't
thought of doing that but unfortunately
the tubing on the other side doesn't
reach and yeah you can get other tubing
and put the fittings on that and then it
will reach but I don't have tubing in
that diameter so I can't do that it's
not a quick and easy thing about have
the tubing so for the moment this is how
does this stay if I could turn it around
that might be a way to go about it and
then I could if it longer graphics cards
you know not ones with their own
radiator but certainly an air-cooled
graphics card would fit so in the
meantime I've pretty much got no option
but to use the r9 nano so haven't
actually used this thing in a build
really so yeah
finally got a purpose for the r9 nano
and that will fit up there quite snug so
you can see that fits with plenty of
room to spare so with that being the
case let's stick the r9 nano in there
finish the build and then take a look at
it all complete and yeah please try to
ignore the mess of cables I have here it
was definitely a mistake using a
full-size power supply well sort of I
wanted that in there because I do plan
to overclock the hell out of the 18 core
CPI didn't really want to do that with a
you know 500 to 600 watt power supply
seat under what - might boot oh okay
if I probably know if I was going to
stick this in there anyway
that's the situation let's get back to
building
well that looks pretty fancy doesn't it
man I'd love to put some hard to be
custom liquid cooling setup and they're
cooling the CPU and GPU that'd be nice
might be something I'm gonna have to do
pretty soon I think anyway it's a bit of
a disappointment that I couldn't fit the
Vega 64 liquid cooled graphics card in
there are perhaps even a 1080i this
liquid cools but for now I really want
to be able to test out that bits power
monoblock so this is a setup I've had to
go with speaking of which in a follow up
video I will be overclocking this 18
core beast I'll be running a few
benchmarks and of course I'll be
monitoring things like temperatures and
reporting that is back so that should be
very interesting to say the least
before that though here's some b-roll of
the system complete hope you guys enjoy
that I'm your host Steve say again sir</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
