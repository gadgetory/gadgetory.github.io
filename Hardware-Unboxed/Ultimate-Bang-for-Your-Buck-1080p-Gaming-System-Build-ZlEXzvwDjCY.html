going to be building the best value
1080p gaming PC you can get right now
we spent a bit of time over the last few
months talking about the best value
components we've done a few videos on
CPUs and GPUs and of course we're always
on the lookout for absolute bargain buy
so today's build is all about taking our
recommendations for the best bang for
your buck components and putting them
into a highly capable bill targeting
1080p 60fps at decent quality settings
in modern games we already have a build
video up on the channel for the best
bang for your buck of 1440p build so if
you're after a higher-end system we
recommend checking that one out but here
we're focusing in on mid-range 1080p
gaming for a low price so let's start
with the CPU is still a very obvious
choice here for the best bang for your
buck and that's the Rison 5 2600 this
chip is still available for a hundred
and sixty dollars through amazon and has
been for the last few months offering
great performance thanks to its six
cores and twelve threads
plus it supports overclocking right from
the get-go well it's going to be
overkill for gaming at 1080p with a
mid-range GPU we've gone with the Rison
five 2600 because it will give your
system room to grow as you upgrade your
GPU down the line and it'll remain very
capable unless you go right up to a
flagship GPU like an RT X 2080 or 20
atti it also offers unbeatable
productivity performance in this price
bracket so if you want to do a bit of
content creation or game streaming you
really aren't going to find anything
better for around that 160 dollar mark
we'd also recommend the arisin 320 200 G
for more budget-conscious shoppers at
$95 powering that CPU with a mid-range
GPU still won't lead to CPU bottlenecks
in most games but for this build verizon
v 2600 is what we're using well actually
the 2600 X because I don't have a 2600
on hand right now either way there's no
better bang for your buck CPU right now
what motherboard you choose is also
obviously a big consideration and there
are lots of a.m. for compatible
motherboards on the market right now so
finding a good one is hard but when
you're packin a risin 5 2600 the obvious
choice is something beef
50 because you can still overclock on
p450 and they're well suited to rise in
five there's not a huge need to go up to
export 74 a build like this once again
for this build we're using MSI's be for
50m mortar and that's for a couple of
reasons firstly in our B 450 motherboard
vrm test the MSI be 450 tomahawk had
excellent vrm performance and the mortar
uses the same theorem design this means
we're getting great power delivery and
cooling that suitable for not just risin
five twenty six hundred overclocking but
rise in seven overclocking should you
choose to upgrade in the future the
mortar is also a little cheaper than
tomahawk both are available for around
100 to 120 dollar mark and still offer
great features like us beat C and six
channel audio which you don't always get
on the cheaper boards the most important
component in this build is the GPU and
for 1080p gaming right now there is one
clear standout option the AMD Radeon rx
570 the rx 570 is available right now
for as long as a hundred and forty
dollars with two free games bundled in
making it an absolute steal for budget
gamers and honestly there's not a lot of
competition looking at our performance
started from the past year the rx 570 is
the winner in terms of cost per frame or
pure gaming value by a mile
the newest competitors would be the
nvidia geforce gtx 1063 gigabyte and
Radeon rx 580 but right now neither are
as good value as the rx 570 with an Rx
570 new system you'll be looking at
1080p 60 FPS gameplay in modern titles
like battlefield 5 hitman 2 and Forte's
our horizon for using ultra settings and
even in poorly optimized games like
Assassin's Creed Odyssey you can still
expect decent performance at 1080p using
it optimized settings and that's all for
just a hundred and forty bucks this
exact model we're using Hebe for this
build is the gigabyte horas rx 570 this
was the cheapest rx5 seven you could get
in australia though you should always
check with your local retailers to see
which one is the best value for you
currently in the United States it looks
like power color will sell you a red
dragon rx 574 below $150 so again check
your local retailers for memory here
we've gone with 16 gigabytes of ddr4
3000 from Team drew
it was actually a big toss up for this
video between 16 gigabytes and 8
gigabytes we tend to find 16 gig to be
better for gaming and will future-proof
your system a bit better than 8
gigabytes but naturally you can save a
bit of cash opting for 8 gig instead
pricing is currently around $85 for 8
gigabytes and a dual channel kit
compared to 110 dollars
for 16 gigabytes at the cheapest so
you're getting a lot better bang for
your buck opting for 16 gigabytes for
just that little bit more money here
we're using teams t force nighthawk RGB
memory because it looks cool for the
completed build though if you're not
after RGB lighting you can save a few
dollars but we definitely recommend at
least ddr4 3000 speeds for rice and make
sure you also get a dual channel kit
with at least two sticks for the rest of
the components we recommend using the
red stealth box cooler that comes with
the risin 5 2600 but our review sample
didn't come with one so instead of using
these super cheap cryo read ml na that's
the stuff post hand in front of me here
that just costs all of 20 bucks and
basically will suit our cooling is just
fine for storage we figure a lot of you
guys building a system you like to
configure with either whatever you had
in your old build or a selection of SSDs
and hard drives that makes your Nate so
this pal I guess fully up to you but for
us we're using the team T force Delta R
GB SSD in a 250 gig capacity if you
don't already have a brute SSD this is
actually very affordable at the moment
it's a basic yet capable sided drive and
it's currently available for just 50
bucks so it's a really good buy there
RGB lighting is pretty cool as well for
the case let's get this MSI motherboard
box out of the way for just one second
heat here we're using the deep cool mat
Rex 55 RGB this is a seriously great buy
for a budget case it's just $75 and
comes with three 120 millimeter RGB fans
in the front or it's available for as
little as 45 dollars with no facts clear
the RGB fan version is popular because
it's currently out of stock at Newegg
again though we recommend shopping
around to find something that you like
that will fit into your budget and for
our bill also be adding in an exhaust
fan into this case and finally we have
the power supply hiding behind here
you can't go past the Corsair cx-5 50m
this thing can be
for as low as 50 bucks it's 80 plus
bronze certified and semi modular making
it the perfect PSU for budget builders
so that's everything going into this
build and for the price we're looking at
around 650 us which is a great price for
a highly capable bang for your buck
1080p build in 2018 with a bit of future
proofing built in us aziz are looking at
around $1,000 for a similar build from p
ck skier so again that's a great price
for this sort of gaming pc and i've
talked about the components though let's
get into the build process
okay so now everything is done we've
shown off the build using some sexy
b-roll and here couldn't be happier with
what we've been able to achieve for $650
this is basically the ultimate bang for
your buck gaming PC for the holiday
season I'm sure this will make a great
gift for Steve because if there's one
thing he doesn't have enough of right
now it's fully built systems capable of
1080p 60fps gaming but let's not tell
Steve about my Christmas plans we'll
keep that a surprise for him as for
overclocking the Rison 520 600 using
this cheap cooler and the B 450 M mortar
we're looking at a four point one
gigahertz all core overclock at one
point three three volts with CPU
temperatures around 85 degrees Celsius
which considering the size of this
cooler and it's dirt cheap price is a
very good result haven't missed about
too much with GPU overclocking but of
course that's possible as well with the
RX 570 anyway that's it for this build
