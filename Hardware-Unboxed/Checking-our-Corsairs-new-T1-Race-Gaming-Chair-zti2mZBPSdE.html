get we're doing things a little bit
differently there's not going to be any
of those blue bar graphs in this one and
well there's any no benchmarking at all
but wait before you click away
believe me this one still be well worth
watching I will be showing you a bit of
a tour of my benchmark lab and I'll be
putting together a cool new gaming chair
from Corsair and that's where I planned
this at my backside for at least the
next 24 hours while I complete my rise
in three benchmarks a few months ago now
I took a short trip to attend a Corsair
event where they were showing off the at
the time that was the upcoming t1 race
gaming chairs and it's a good thing I
did because these sort of race gaming
type chair things they're not really my
thing over the years I've done quite a
few of them and they just haven't really
impressed me they certainly haven't or
don't hold a candle to my daily driver
which is the yo-yo human
that's quite a smart sophisticated chair
and it was certainly chance knows up at
the gaming chairs I've seen however as I
said it was a good thing I did attend
Cortez event for the t1 race and check
it out in person because it is a really
really nice chair before I tell you
about the chair let's quickly put it
together I won't do the whole process in
real time but it'll probably take 10 or
15 minutes and you guys probably don't
want to see me fumbling around for 10 or
15 minutes try to put a chair together
so I'll speed through that I've got my
daughter's to help me so that should
make it slightly more challenging but
it's enjoyable and once I'm done I'll
sit my backside on it and tell you a
little bit about it
oh well there you go I think it was well
worth the small amount of effort I put
into putting it together so as you can
see I do have the blue version of the
seat it also comes in yellow red gray
and black so if you want a more stealthy
look the black version would be the way
to go however I quite like to be however
unboxed a blue highlight to this version
and the blue stitching which I'll show
in a moment right behind me on the
synthetic or PU leather it looks really
nice actually right away that's
something I should touch on although
this material looks like leather it's
actually split leather it's been
overlaid with polyurethane and that's
why it's commonly referred to as PU
leather when it compared to real full
grain leather PU leather is thinner and
therefore not as strong but it is as you
might expect cheaper to produce it's
sort of a nice looking finish both lack
of durability means it won't survive the
same kind of abuse still it is commonly
used for furniture and works well for
this purpose the cool thing about the
look of the t1 rate is that it features
two different textured leathers one is
your more traditional looking leather if
you will while the other is an
aggressive looking carbon fiber texture
the carbon fiber area is aware course
they have applied their colored accents
and as you can see the blue looks very
nice although I am coming from an Ergo
human I can honestly say the t1 race is
a comfortable chair and it does have a
good degree of adjustment to added
comfort and ergonomics is it as good as
something like the ergo human though
well no it's definitely not they're
going human though is a best-in-class
product and it also cost significantly
more moving on the back of the seat does
recline from a 90 degree angle down to
180 degrees
also included in the package are some PU
leather wrapped neck and lumber pillows
for additional support the rest of the
chair is very durable thanks to a mostly
steel construction and I really like
those heavy-duty rollerblade type caster
wheels which are not only very strong
but also a lay to glide around with ease
this is particularly useful for me as I
like to move from test system to test
system the armrests can be adjusted in
multiple ways they can be raised to a
height of 38 centimeters or lowered to
just 28 centimeters they also move left
or right forwards or backwards and can
also be swivels as well
course the chair is also hot adjustable
using a steel constructed gas lift which
allows you to sit your backside as low
as 32 centimeters or as high as 42
centimeters so here I am sitting at my
main PC and before some of you
completely spaz out at the fact that
there are some cables on my desk
remember this is an actual work zone I
do all my benchmarking here so that
their test systems they're constantly
being moved around and used so you don't
regularly pump out 30 game benchmark
videos and have a setup that looks like
it could win set up walls for example
anyway to my left right now I have my
risin test rig with the asrock X 370 Tai
Chi motherboard for those of you haven't
seen the video of this build coming
together I'll provide a link for that in
the video description the reason that
systems sitting here to my left right
now is because I've started testing
rising three for tomorrow night's video
so keep an eye out for that one then to
my right I have the Intel equivalent
which features the asrock z2 70 Tai Chi
and again if you want to know more about
the system I'll include a link to it in
the video description
both of these rigs were sponsored by
Corsair they provided many parts for me
to build the systems though I should
note that this video including the t1
race chair has it been sponsored by
Corsair they genuinely just sent me the
chair and said hey check it out
sit on it do your thing some
benchmarking and hopefully you'll have a
good time getting back to my
benchmarking setup the next thing I want
to do is upgrade the monitors I use up
here it's a bit of a mismatch of
displays at the moment but I do plan to
replace everything here soon with
something something more practical for
the work I do up here but that will no
doubt be a video for another day yeah
this is where I do all my testing and
once I'm done I head downstairs to the
studio which many of you are no doubt
very familiar with and down there I have
a proper lighting setup sound deadening
and all that good stuff to make their
videos seem semi-professional of course
I'm still in them but there's only so
much you can do so I think we've covered
everything here let's move over to the
wall over here where I store most of my
graphics cards well at least the ones I
often use for benchmarking as you know
there's a heap more downstairs in the
studio over here we have some more
shelves with more things on them this is
my CPU section these are where I store
all the CPUs that I as you might imagine
swap
in and out of the test systems quite
often anyway I'd better wrap this up and
get back to benchmarking those rising
three CPUs they aren't going to test
themselves unfortunately so the core
said T one race it looks to be a great
quality chair certainly much better than
a lot of the gaming chairs I've seen
over the years and I'm keen to give it a
really good workout I'll probably move
it downstairs to the studio soon so I
can use it more regularly while filming
these videos the only potential issue I
see here is the price like many course
and products the quality is very good
and it would want to be as this thing
cost $350 u.s. or $500 Aussie that
sounds like a lot well I know it is but
chairs are also quite expensive and
entry level gaming chair they start at
about $180 u.s. and if I'm honest at
that price all the models I've seen a
pretty awful some of the better budget
examples include the dxracer origin
that's priced at $240 u.s. though again
it's not nearly as nice as the t1 race
there's also the GT Omega Pro Racing
that's a good option at $270 US and I
prefer that to the dxracer if I'm honest
moving up the food chain and a bit
closer to the t1 race is asking price is
the a.k racing prime gigabytes horas a
GC 300 and the verdict ESL 2000 all of
which cost $300 US for $330 u.s. there
is the dxracer formula series and the TT
eSports GT fit but I still think I
prefer Corsairs offering to both of
those at 350 dollars though you will
want to make sure the t1 race is the
chair for you before dropping that kind
of cash at $300 for me the t1 race would
be a no-brainer
$350 us though I'd certainly be thinking
twice about the purchase and weighing up
my options still overall though another
nice new product from Corsair and as I
said I'm keen to really put it to work
and well that's exactly what I'm going
to go do now as I finish my rise and
three testing I'm your host Steve see
you again next time guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
