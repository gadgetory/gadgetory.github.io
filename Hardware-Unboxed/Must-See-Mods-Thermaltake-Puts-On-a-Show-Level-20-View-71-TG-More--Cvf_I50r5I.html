Computex coverage this time I have a
heap of a eye candy for you guys at the
thermaltake booth but before that they
will quickly show MSI some love for
sending me to Computex if you're in the
market for a new gaming desktop PC then
check out MSI's new high-end core i7
systems also right now they are offering
a free you played game key for Tom
Clancy's Ghost Recon wildlands with
select purchases it's also possible to
score a wildlands game code with select
msi motherboards check out the new x99 Z
270 and h2 70 range link is in the video
description without question one of the
most impressive displays that I've come
across yet was this the thermal take
booth the thermal tape team has fully
embraced two things for this event RGB
lights and extreme PC modding starting
my tour I began with this the new and by
new I mean yet to be released view 91
tgd this behemoth sports a pair of
massive 5 millimeter thick tempered
glass doors and given their size and
thickness they no doubt weigh quite a
bit helping users deal with removing the
huge glass panels are a pair of heavy
duty hinges on each door by removing
just two thumb screws the side panels
remove like actual doors which is very
cool indeed the door panels can also be
completely removed by lifting them off
the hinges the case is very flexible in
what it can house as well
offering support for anywhere between
three and ten three and a half inch
drives depending on the configuration
there's plenty of options for liquid
cooling as well with accommodation for a
five hundred and sixty millimeter
radiator on the top and a 480 millimeter
radiator in the front also the case
comes with four ring fans and still they
are 140 millimeter fans and they feature
blue LEDs next up we have the view 71 TG
another yet to be released case
scheduled for release later this year I
believe thermaltake said they are
targeting somewhere around November this
model features not one not two but
rather four side panels wrapped in glass
something I found really interesting
about this case is that it can mount a
radiator inside against the motherboard
tray here it pushes air out the backside
panel or
suppose the right side panel this is a
unique setup that I'd like to take a
closer look at in the near future
then the last yet to be released case
that I stumbled upon was this guy the
view 21 TG and yes we have another
tempered glass case here but I think you
guys are really going to be interested
in this one this smart looking case will
be hitting shelves with an asking price
of just $70 Aussie so that translates to
about $50 us apart from the nice
tempered glass you get a case that
supports a three hundred and sixty
millimeter radiator in the top and front
along with a separate basement section
for the power supply and all those messy
cables this is a seriously awesome
looking budget case or at least an
affordable case so keep an eye out for
that one next up we have this insane
looking core p7 setup sporting more
flashing lights than a Myer Christmas
tree display the point of this display
was to show thermal take canal link-up
and synchronize their RGB power supplies
ring fans water blocks light strips
reservoirs and radiators yes you heard
that last bit right thermal takes now
making RGB radiators RGB radiators might
not excite all of you but I know what
will copper radiators thermal taker will
finally be offering radiators
constructed from copper later this year
and they tell me that there will be two
forty three sixty and four eighty
millimeter models available as you might
expect they will come in a price premium
over the current aluminium models but
exact details aren't available at this
time
Thermal takes also upgraded their W for
water block with a new plus version
featuring improved RGB lighting now
there's sixteen point eight million
colors and you have eight LEDs embedded
around their acrylic section of the
block so that's pretty cool before
jumping to the case mods I was shown
this the ultimate Green Team fanboy
accessory hopefully there will be an AMD
version as well but no word on that at
this point anyway thermaltake developed
this case in collaboration with nvidia
so no surprises there the case is slated
for release in three months time for a
rather reasonable price of one hundred
and twenty dollars Australian I'm not
normally into these kinds of fanboy type
products but I have to say Thermaltake
has done a really good job of making
this thing look a bit special moving on
I came across this beauty
thermaltake level 20 titanium this is a
concept design chassis but thermaltake
have been working on it for a very long
time the case looks like it would lend
itself very well to a modular type
design almost like a Lego block PC but
thermal tape wasn't confirming anything
about this when I asked what they did
say is that each chamber or I'm going to
call them modules is designed to house
different Hardware for example in the
front they case can install radiators
fans pumps and reservoirs like
Thermaltake have in this demo build or
you could simply fill it with storage
drives and I think it will come at
something like 16 harddrive so that's
pretty crazy then up top we obviously
have the power supply and this can be
mounted vertically or horizontally and
there's also the front panel IO stuff at
the front of that module finally we have
the largest module which is of course
housing the motherboard graphics card
and so on the glass panels for each
module open up on hinges and this
provides easy access to the hardware
inside I have to say coming from the
level 10 design which was highly unique
but also highly impractical the level 20
not only looks even better but I feel
this is the case you could actually live
with ok so now the modern stuff the
extremely modern stuff first we have
this Tower 900 build which has been
given a Donkey Kong theme this was put
together by thermal takes us a team and
I believe they completed the bill within
about a week so that's very impressive
this mod was created by Ron Lee
Christensen and Ron is a US based model
this is of course another tower 900 mod
and most of the cases on display were
based upon that chassis this though was
one of the more extreme examples and
apparently three months of work went
into this mod so that's some serious
dedication those of you who really
enjoyed titanfall 2 will want to take
this beauty home the Creator Jessie is
from the Philippines and he dedicated
this build to his grandmother who sadly
recently passed away naming it Liberty
after her so that's really nice the
build is extremely well crafted though
sadly like many of the system's wrapped
in glass I had a hard time getting the
right angles to really do it justice
here we have one of the most outlandish
looking builds and this was created by a
Brazilian motor this thing is based on
thermal takes call X 71 and it's hard to
say what if anything from the original
chassis made it into this final product
I guess there's cut up bits of xw1 all
over the place
and
a very cool system indeed there's still
more than half a dozen modern systems to
look at so rather than talk you through
all of them let's quickly admire the
display
you
now
well guys there you have it this is
without question one of the most
eye-catching displays I've seen yet
context 2017 then will take us a
mountain of new product something later
in the year a lot of them look very
exciting and I can't wait to check them
out particularly those more affordable
tempered glass cases those looked really
nice I hope you enjoyed the thermaltake
coverage I'm your host Steve I'll see
you guys again real soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
