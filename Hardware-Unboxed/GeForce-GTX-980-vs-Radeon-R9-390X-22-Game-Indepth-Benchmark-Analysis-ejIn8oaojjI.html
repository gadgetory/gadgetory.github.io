price cuts across their entire line
current generation GPUs that means the
geforce gtx 980 and radeon r9 390x are
more affordable than ever at the bargain
basement price of four hundred seventy
dollars and three hundred and ninety
dollars respectively okay so they're
both hideously expensive but there seems
to be the price of high-end gaming these
days the point being if you have around
four hundred ish dollars to drop on a
graphics card which should you buy the
more affordable 390x
certainly seems very tempting but should
you invest a bit more in the gtx 980
will you reach a point of diminishing
returns well strap yourself in as I take
you through an in-depth 22-game analysis
that compares the GTX 980 a 99 390x
head-to-head testing takes part at 1440p
and using Fras we'll be reporting the
average minimum and frame time
performance both graphics cards provided
a smooth 69 FPS average frame rate and
Batman Arkham Knight at 1440p the 390x
did dip down to a slightly lower 56 FPS
frame rate despite the slightly lower
minimum frame rate of 390x the frame
time performance was the same as each
card took just 18 point 6 milliseconds
between frames previously we found the
gtx 980 and i9 390x to be neck-and-neck
in a battlefield 4 test but it seems
AMD's new crimson driver gives the 390x
a slight performance boost the 390 X was
2 frames per second faster on average of
1440p another close battle can be found
in black ops 3 as the 980 was just a
single frame faster of 1440p that said
when comparing the minimum frame rate
the 980 was 3 FPS faster though again
this isn't exactly a significant margin
the civilization beyond Earth
performance is interesting as the 390x
provided the highest average frame rate
who was considerably slower than the 980
when comparing the minimum frame rate
this afforded the 980 is slightly better
frame time result as well both the 980
and 390x averaged 44 FPS at 1440 pin
Crysis 3 the
again we find it's the nine eightieth at
delivers the better minimum frame rate
resolve and consequently the better
frame time performance the Dragon Age
Inquisition performance was virtually
neck-and-neck as the 980 was just 1 FPS
faster on average while both provided
the same minimum frame rate result
despite that the 980 delivered
considerably better frame time
performance although both graphics cards
provide a very playable performance in
f1 2015 at 1440p the 980 was
considerably faster reaching 80 frames
per second opposed to just 70 FPS for
the 390x despite the rather large frame
rate discrepancy the frame time results
were very similar
fallout 4 played best on the 980 years
though the difference in the average
frame rate was just 3 FPS that said it
was the minimum frame rate that made up
the biggest difference is the 980 was 6
FPS faster than the 390 X here
despite this the frame time performance
was much the same as was the case with
f1 2015 we find that both graphics cards
were able to deliver silky smooth
performance in grid Autosport
despite the 980 offering considerably
better performance with an average of 92
fps the 980 was 18% faster than the 390
x in this game as we found to be the
case more often than not the 980 and
390x deliver very similar performance
this time when testing with grand theft
auto 5 the 980 was on average just one
frame faster and despite the same
minimum frame rate the 980 also
delivered slightly better frame time
performance as well the hitman
absolution performance favored the 390x
by a small margin as it was 3 FPS faster
when comparing the average frame rate
just 1 FPS faster for the minimum frame
rate both the 980 and 390x averaged a
playable 79 fps in Mad Max though the
390x did drop to a slightly lower 64 fps
this method the 980 did provide better
frame time performance but with both
cards at or under the 20 millisecond
mark the difference was negligible Metro
redux still proved to be very demanding
as the 980 averaged just 42 FPS that
said this meant it was for FPS faster
than the 390x
the 390x took home the win in Middle
Earth shadow of Mordor with an average
of 54 FPS and a minimum of just 45 FPS
the 980 wasn't a great deal slower with
51 FPS and a minimum of 43 FPS but the
390x was a clear winner here
unsurprisingly the deity enjoys a rather
large win in the heavily game works
injected project cards winning by a 20%
margin over the three 90s that said the
390x still delivered a respectable 60
FPS average of 1440p and the frame time
performance wasn't bad either
this time we find that although the 980
provided stronger average performance
and Sleeping Dogs it was slightly slower
when comparing the minimum frame rate
even with the latest in video game ready
driver Star Wars Battlefront plays
considerably better an AMD Hardware this
isn't surprising though given this is an
AMD supported title and it is possible
Nvidia can make up some ground
nevertheless for now the game is best
played on AMD hardware and the 390x was
23% faster than the 980 the 980 provided
slightly better performance and thief
with 82 frames per second opposed to 78
FPS for the 390x
that said both graphics card delivered
very smooth performance the 980 offered
a reasonable performance gain in Total
War a delight over the 390 X with an
average of 35 fps opposed to just 30 fps
for the Radian with tress effects
enabled the 980 still does well with an
average of 55 FPS making it 5 FPS faster
than the 390x interestingly while the
980 was faster in Tomb Raider using
truss effects the 390 X is faster in The
Witcher 3 using hair works what madness
is this with the game patched up to date
we find that hair works now runs very
well in AMD hardware it's a shame this
feature was so damaging to performance
when the game was released finally we
have watchdogs and here the 980 and 390
acts to live a virtually identical
performance though it is interesting to
note that the 390x did provide better
frame time performance there you have it
22 games tested and a heap of data to
crunch breaking it down quickly the
GeForce GTX 980 was on average just 3%
faster than the Radeon r9 390x to 1440p
we
comparing the average framerate and 4%
faster for the minimum frame rate before
we declare the 982 obvious winner here
let's factor in some pricing information
currently on Newegg the cheapest 980
will set you back 440 dollars though
most of price in the 472 480 dollar
range still taking 440 dollars as a
baseline means that the 980 is at least
13% more expensive than the 390 X that
we expect on average to find around an
18% price difference this then makes a
390 X the better value option as it's
just 3% slower and at least 11 percent
cheaper unfortunately as is often the
case it's not that simple as there's yet
more factors to consider the 398
consumes at least 25% more power based
on our testing while we don't believe
this will impact your electricity bill
too much it does speak to the cards true
value on average we found that while the
390x provides a 13% overclock the 980
doubles that with an average boost
overclock of 1534 megahertz for a 26%
overclock also we found that partner
cards such as those from gigabyte for
example run cooler and quieter on the
1980s and they do on the 390x taking all
these factors into consideration there
are clear arguments for going either way
still if we were to pick a winner here
it would be the slightly slower Radeon
r9 390x for the simple fact that out of
the box performance is much the same and
it's a heck of a lot cheaper thanks for
watching another Hardware unbox
