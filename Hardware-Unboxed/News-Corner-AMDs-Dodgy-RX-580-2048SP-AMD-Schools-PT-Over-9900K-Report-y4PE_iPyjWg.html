corner in a special Sunday edition
thanks to the coin 919 hundred K embargo
ending on Friday which is when we
normally run these episodes anyway we've
had an absolutely massive week of news
including the launch of the 9900 K and
the RT X 2070 a few days earlier check
out our reviews or both of those new
products if you haven't already but on
top of that we've had
AMD doing some good stuff and some dodgy
stuff rumors of new graphics cards from
both AMD and NVIDIA production updates
for new technologies at several
companies and plenty more this is a
jam-packed news corner so let's get
started I guess we should start with the
story of the AMD Radeon rx 580 2048 SP
because it's generated a ton of
discussion in the hardware box discord
chat earlier this week as it turns out
and I guess has been the case for some
time now AMD is exactly like NVIDIA when
it comes to naming graphics cards they
released two products with basically the
same name but have different
specifications and performed differently
on the Nvidia side we've seen it many
times with the GTX 1063 gigabyte the GT
1030 ddr4 and the gtx 1053 gigabyte AMD
has done in the past with the RX 560 14
and 16 CU variants and now they've done
it again with the misleading Radeon arts
580 2048 SP so the standard rx 580 has
2304 stream processors it's clocked up
to 13 40 megahertz
it has a 185 watt TDP and it comes with
eight gigabit per second gddr5 this is
the version you get when you purchase an
RS 580 as a discrete GPU or when you buy
an OEM system with an RX 580 inside
except now we also have the Arc's 580
2048 SP which as you might have guessed
cuts down the stream process account to
2048 it also drops the boost clock to
1280 for megahertz and reduces the gddr5
transfer rate to 7 gigabit per second
leading to a lower TDP all up of just a
hundred and fifty watts
I guess another way to look at this card
is it's basically a slightly overclocked
rx 570 the RX 5/7
also has 2048 SPS yet it's only clocked
up to 12 44 megahertz at this stage the
arcs 580 2048 SP is only destined for
the Chinese market it's not clear
whether it will be sold as a discrete
card for system builders or as a product
just for OMS either way marketing what
is essentially an RX 570 as an RX 580
2048 SP is pretty deceptive even if the
card is only used for OEM systems
it just means someone looking to buy a
prebuilt RX 580 system could be deceived
into thinking the RX 580 2048 SP is the
RX 580 when in fact it's quite a bit
different so mb just don't do this stuff
it's better for consumers if you name
cars like this more in line with the
performance they're delivering the RX
580 2048 SP should really be called the
RX 570 X or something like that and
really we're going to catch you every
time you try and pull dodgy stuff like
this so just don't bother
keep your naming nice and simple in
better news from AMD the company this
week decided to formally respond to the
principle technologies benchmark report
comparing the kora 999 hundred K with
the horizon 720 700 X and other
processes
you know the ridiculously flawed report
we slammed PT and Intel on the channel 4
across several videos and we decided to
release a set of slides on the cria 999
hundred k embargo a day outlining their
specific issues with the benchmarks
conducted giving PT and Intel a bit of a
schooling on how to properly benchmark
things the first of the slides go
through every problem with the PT labs
reports both the horribly flawed first
report and the slightly less floored
second report dimensions most the stuff
we already talked about in the channel
including how PT ran the 2700 X as a
quad core the issues with using
different coolers depending on the CPU
strange BIOS choices and questionable
memory configurations and for the second
report enemies still had issues with
things like the coolest memory
configuration are the sayings that's all
fair enough the second slide goes
through benchmark best practices and all
this stuff it makes complete sense it's
actually a pretty good guide if you're
looking to do any benchmarking
especially a start at the end where Andy
talks about remembering the user it
doesn't make a lot of sense to test 64
gig of ram with a $300 CPU which isn't
going to be
typical consumer configuration so it's
better to test with a more reasonable
setup and it's nice to see only
acknowledging that in their guide of
course I only don't always benchmark
things perfectly at the launch of Rison
we took issue with the company emitting
low resolution gaming data instead using
4k or 1440p to compare their CPUs to
Intel where games are mostly GPU bound
that said they did correct that for
second generation so I guess they also
learn from their mistakes but we
certainly have never seen and reproduce
a set of benchmarks that comes close to
the rubbish Intel and PT served up with
the 9900 k report rumors are heating up
surrounding a new Polaris GPU from AMD
believed to be called the Radeon RX 590
we've heard a variety of rumors over the
past few weeks using names such as the
rx 680 but it appears with the latest
election of legs as personal video cards
we're actually getting an RX 590 the RX
590 is reportedly based on a Polaris
refresh GPU possibly manufactured using
a 12 nanometer process rather than 14
nanometer like existing Polaris products
this no change would allow ambi to hit
higher clock speeds with rumors
suggesting the RX 590 is clocked up to
1545 megahertz which is a good 200 5
megahertz higher than the standard rx
580 there's no word on core
configuration though looking at these
leaked 3d mark performance numbers it's
looking like the same 2304 streaming
processes as the RX 580 with the same
memory configuration so far video cards
has received word that a soos is working
on an ROG Strix version of the rx 590
while H is is also planning on releasing
an RX 5 90s that's pretty compelling
evidence there interesting the DeSousa
is looking to bring back the ROG Strix
brand for AMD cars that is likely thanks
to NVIDIA killing the GPP anyway
interesting times ahead sounds like this
new players card isn't too far away and
if it provides 10 to 15% more
performance than the rx 580 it could be
well suited to compete with whatever in
the video has in store with the GTX 2060
and I guess bridging the gap until 7
nanometers next year speaking of Nvidia
apparently gigabyte is working on a GTX
1060 with gddr5 X memory
this new version of the GTX 1060 would
be based on a GP 104 GPU not GP 106 used
for other GTX 10 60s and it would use of
course faster clocked memory there's not
a whole lot of information to go on and
it seems a little strange to us an
Nvidia would release another Pascal card
at this point and one with gddr5 X
memory at that but the video cards tends
to be pretty reliable in less
interesting use this weight gigabyte
percent a Halloween promotion for the rx
2072 all sounds fine except the company
also listed the rx 27 t TI in the
promotion as well it makes sense that in
video would consider releasing an Rx 27
t TI except gigabyte confirmed it was
just a typo so yeah moving on DVR v
memory is on track for production in
late 2019 according to an update
provided by cadence and micron the DDR 5
spec hasn't been finalized by JEDEC yet
but we're expecting to get that spec
soon and certainly before ddr5 begins to
ramp up DVR 5 is set to bring a range of
improvements including higher capacity
chips faster speeds and lower power
consumption cadence is currently claming
that for ddr5 3200 speeds ddr5 will have
36% more bandwidth than ddr4 3200 and
when bumping ddr5 up to 4800 speeds that
jumps up to an 87 percent increased
relative to ddr4 3200 typical DDR 5
speeds are expected to sit between 40 to
66 and 6,400 mega transfers per second
cadence are expecting ddr5 to hit
service first followed by consumer
platforms as soon as 2020 and this
should hold true for lpddr4 as well
micron are expecting to begin production
on 16 gigabit ddr5 chips on a sub 18
nanometer process in late 2019 Corsair
have launched a new selection of SSDs
under the force MP 510 brand
these are PCIe M got two SSDs that used
to Sheba's 64 layer three DTL scene and
with the new faster e 12 controller from
vison basically this makes the MP 510 a
much faster SSD overall compared to the
older MP 500 we're looking at 610 K
random raid I ops for the 960 gigabyte
drive along with 570
kay writes and over three gigabyte per
second sequential transfers these
performance figures of course changed
slightly for the 240 gig 480 gig and
1920 gigabyte models anatec reviewed the
new SSD and found it to be very
competitive calling it a pretty good
deal for a high-end nvme SSD learning
that it's not the fastest drive they've
tested but it still performs very well
in most tests you can get an MP 510 now
at $66 for 240 gigabytes 125 dollars for
480 gigabytes and a two hundred and $36
for 960 gigabytes a couple of quicker
topics to finish this news corner off
Samsung has begun production of 7lp paid
chips Samsung's 7 nanometre
manufacturing process uses extreme
ultraviolet lithography for some layers
allowing 7 LPP to deliver massive gains
in some areas relative to their 10 l PE
process Samsung is claiming a 40% area
reduction for the same complexity 50%
lower power consumption at the same
frequency or 20% higher performance at
the same power compared to ten lpe
10 LPP is Samsung's slightly superior 10
nanometer process so 7lp pays gains
won't be quite as high measured relative
to 10 LPP but still like with TSMC 7
nanometre tech this is a generational
leap on 10 nanometers an ant x article
goes into a lot of detail on 7l PP so
it's worth reading if you're interested
in further details on the tech final
topic of this week dell has launched the
ultra sharp 49 one of the first monitors
to use a 49 inch 50 120 by 1440 display
this is a 60 Hertz IPS display designed
for productivity effectively giving you
two 27-inch 1440p monitors side by side
without the bezel in between the LG may
panel is curved with a 3,800 r curvature
and it sports 99% srgb coverage with a
factory calibration to a delta a of less
than 2.0 it also supports USB C along
with DisplayPort and HDMI
the u 49:19 DW the official name for the
ultra sharp 49 will be available on
October 26th for 1700 us doors and Dell
said they're sending one out for us to
test at the end of October so look out
for that soon
all right so that's it for this week's
news corner lots of interesting topics
in this one probably missed a few things
as well but that's life subscribe to get
the segment in your inbox every week
usually they go out on Friday but we've
had a few releases I guess stuffing
around the schedule lately hopefully
we'll be back to normal soon consider
