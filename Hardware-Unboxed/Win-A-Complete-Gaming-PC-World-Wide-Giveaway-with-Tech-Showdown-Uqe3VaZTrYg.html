just got a quick Sunday video for you
we're announcing a new international PC
giveaway so that is a global PC giveaway
worldwide anyone anywhere can have a
chance to win it now this isn't an
insane gaming rig by any means it's not
the latest and greatest Hardware but it
is still a very capable gaming system
and well it's a free gaming PC and it's
free to enter so there is that as many
of you know Tim and myself are over in
Taiwan for Computex last month and we
did catch up with keV from tech showdown
he even joined in a couple of our live
streams one of which was that hilarious
megamix stream where he nearly threw up
about half a dozen times but even so he
did enjoy himself anyway at some point
we got chatting about a full system
giveaway Kevin's been really keen to do
one of those for his viewers for a long
time now and he did have a lot of the
components needed basically had
everything except for the motherboard
and CPU they are two core components but
he did have everything else and he did
have one of the most costly components
and that was the graphics card so I felt
we were well on our way to making that
happen
so adding to the build I dug out a core
i7 77 ok processor one that I no longer
needed because I do have two of those
and I also had a spare as rockers ed 217
gaming k-6 motherboard so as I said not
the latest and greatest but the 7700 K
is still a very capable gaming CPU and
the particular chip that we will be
including has no issues running at 5
gigahertz so it'll still blitz and most
titles complementing that gig have had a
spare corsair hydra h 115 i'll liquid
cooler a 16 gigabytes of kingston hyperx
ddr4 2666 memory the gigabyte g1 gaming
GTX 1070 so that's quite a nice graphics
card right there and that's all going
inside the corsair 760 t case with 3 140
millimeter fans there on the other
components we were lacking include an
SSD obviously another crucial component
there and a power supply also another
important component I guess pretty much
everything is important
anyway silicon power is helping us out
on the storage front with there
a 55 to 56 year by SSD so a big thank
you to them and then making this
international giveaway possible or
making this giveaway possible to be sent
to anyone anyone can win this
it's an international global worldwide
giveaway I guess that's what I'm trying
to say anyway big thank you to play tech
who also provided the gigabyte G 750 H
it's a goal greater power supply so
thanks to them and thanks for paying for
the shipping that really is the biggest
issue for us small youtubers are these
full system giveaways it's just the
shipping costs a massive you can imagine
just sending a case with nothing in it
it's quite costly but sending a case
with a Holly but bits in it making it
very heavy is extremely costly so big
thank you to play tech for footing the
bill on the International shipping to
enter all you have to do is click the
gleam I'll link in the video description
make sure you subscribe to at least one
of the channels involved and again it's
completely free to enter and anyone
anywhere can win what oh oh the cameras
still on sorry about that I didn't think
anyone would be watching beyond the
gleam iron link information I thought
you just all be madly voting yeah
alright thanks for watching good luck
hope you win I'm your host Steve and I
will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
