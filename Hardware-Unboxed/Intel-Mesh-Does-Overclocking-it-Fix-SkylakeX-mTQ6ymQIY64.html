x-range arrived and I'm not really sure
how to describe how Intel's the latest
and greatest platform has been received
let's just keep it simple and say there
have been mixed feelings strong mixed
feelings anyway I'm sure you lot are up
to speed so I won't go over all the
details again in this video instead I'll
get right to the point
recently I created a 30 game test
comparing the core i7 7 100x
that's the new 6 core sky like X part
against the tried-and-true core i7 7700
K quad core quite shockingly with 7700 K
blasted the 700 X by 13% margin overall
and it was often up to and Beyond 20%
faster were still the 78 her ex didn't
show any strength either there wasn't a
single game where it beat the 77 ok by
anything more than the margin of error
concluding that video I put the massive
deficit down to the restructured cache
design of the sky like ex architecture
but I noted it could also be the new
mesh design like AMD's infinity fabric
Intel's mesh is a more efficient means
of connecting many calls together and
when compared to the ring bus method
previously used it does save a lot of
die space there are some possible
drawbacks though to the mesh design and
I'll discuss those a bit later in the
video the main focus of this video
though will be overclocking the mesh by
default the mesh runs at the young core
speed which is in the region of 1.8 to
2.4 gigahertz a few viewers claimed than
in order to extract the most performance
out of the 700 X I needed to overclock
the mesh some even claims that pushing
the mesh from 2.4 gigahertz to 3
gigahertz would see the 700 X deliver 77
FK like gaming performance prior to the
video I had actually tried increasing
the mesh to 2.8 gigahertz and notice
maybe a 1 to 2 FPS increase given that
that's within the margin of error what's
really hard to say if the overclocked I
was helping at all so here we are the
mesh ratio has been increased to 30
times giving us a frequency of 3
gigahertz as you can see not much to
report here when testing with rise of
the Tomb Raider this is the same 1 to 2
FPS I saw at 2.0 Keuka Hertz in my
previous tests even with the CPU clocked
at 4.7 gigahertz we see little
improvement performance still rather
than call the day and close the book on
the measure overclocking I decided to
quickly check out a few more games the
next obvious stop for me was battlefield
one and here we did see up to a four
percent performance increase when
comparing the average framerate at the
stop clock speeds it's hardly redefined
the 700 X but it has helped close the
gap between it and the 77 ROK in this
title ok so what about a game where the
7800 X got completely creamed by the
quad-core such a game would be
civilization 6 and here we see the mesh
does boost the minimum frame rate for
the stock configuration by an impressive
10% ok now we're starting to get
somewhere granted even with the mesh
overclock the 700 X is still 15% slower
than 77 ok it's an improvement
nonetheless though that said though once
the CPU cores are overclocked to 4.7 G
cuts we see that the mesh overclocked
now makes a little to no difference the
gains in Far Cry primal another game
where the 700 X gets completely trampled
by the smaller chip pretty miserable at
best the mesh overclocked Nets up to 5%
more performance though for the most
part the gains were more around the 3%
region Grand Theft Auto 5 is another
game where the SI 100x looked very weak
in comparison to the 77 or okay and here
the mesh overclocked does Bruce
performance by 6 percent at the stock
core clock speeds anyway once we
overclock the cause and run them at 4.7
Giga Hertz the measure of a clock now
first performance by just 2% which again
is within the margin of error wrapping
things up I gave hitman a shot and the
DirectX 12 title delivers similar
results to what we've seen already the
minimum frame rate for example is
improved by a decent 7% margin at the
stock core clock speeds but only 3% once
the calls are overclocked to 4.7
gigahertz so I think we can conclude
that the mesh overclocking does help
maybe not just as much summer making out
the game thing to be much less
impressive once you overclock the actual
cause themselves which was surprising I
honestly thought it'd be the other way
around
that would make more sense to me anyway
but that wasn't what I found I should
note that with the mesh
at three gigahertz I did run into the
odd game crash and twice the system
booted up and couldn't find the SSD
increasing the mesh voltage helped
stabilize the system a bit but it didn't
completely solve all the problems I was
having with the 700 on occasions there
was still the odd hiccup I would also
like to just point out that I have tried
the mesh overclock on the asrock X 299
Tai Chi as well as the gigabyte x2 9
horas gaming 3 both provided the same
results
I've also purchased the Isuzu prime x2
99a and that will be arriving later in
the week so I'll see how that board goes
as well before wrapping this video up
I'm just going to talk a little bit
about Intel smash design and Express a
few of my own thoughts right so for a
long time now Intel has been using the
ring buffs method a low latency high
bandwidth solution the ring bus was
introduced with the Nehalem architecture
those impressive LGA 1366 CPUs released
all the way back in 2008 and this in my
opinion is when Intel really started to
hit full stride in those quad-core parts
the ring bus made perfect sense and
enabled a highly efficient design
however as call caps for the server
parts using the same basic architecture
exceeded 12 cores the ring bus method
started to take up a lot of room and the
benefits thing with the lower core count
parts no longer existed the high coil
count models ended up with multiple
rings which ultimately led to a very
complicated design aware of this issue
in designing Zen AMD came up with the
CCX module design which uses what they
call infinity fabric to connect the
multiple CCX modules and this gave AMD a
scalability advantage over intel's ring
bus architecture therefore it was clean
until required a similar method and
therefore they developed the mesh
architecture Intel claims that the mesh
design sees a negligible latency
difference when compared to the ring bus
and this might be true for the really
high coil count CPUs however for the six
core eight core and probably even the
ten core part based on what I've seen so
far the ring bus was a much more
efficient design of course there have
been some other major changes to the
skyline hex architecture so it's really
difficult to say for sure if this is
just the mesh design that's responsible
for the weaker-than-expected gaming
performance in any case what we're now
seeing is much similar performance
between processors such as the core
7/7 her ex and the horizon 5 1600 which
you will soon see in Friday's video not
to give away too much and both of those
processes just mentioned are of course
six core parts having said all that
Intel still does have an IPC advantage
but it's nowhere near like what we saw
in comparing the core i7 7200 okay to
say the risin 5 1500 X for example at
the same clock speeds right now I
believe that while the mesh design might
work well for high coil count CPUs those
exceeding 12 cores or thereabout it
doesn't really work that well for lower
core count CPUs and this is why we're
seeing the 7700 K with its ring bus
design absolutely blasting the 7800 X
until games really require more than say
8 threads the superior resources of the
semi 800 X won't be able to offset the
increased latency of the mesh design
anyway this is just a theory from a guy
who spends way too much time running
benchmarks even more time exporting
crash from Excel what I can tell you is
that overclocking the mesh will help
just probably not as much as you'd like
and well that's where I'm going to leave
this one at least for now anyway
coming up on the channel very soon as in
the next few days I'll have a big 30
game benchmark comparison between the
707 or K and the horizon 5 1600 and
without even trying to hype that one I
can tell you the results are extremely
interesting I'm your host Steve see
again soon guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
