corner in a special time slot this week
on a Monday normally of course we
release these episodes on a Friday the
last Friday was the nvidia RT x unboxing
and truing technical info embargo so we
push news corner out to Monday also as a
heads-up there won't be a news corner
this coming Friday either as we're
pumping out GeForce r-tx follow-up
content at that point another quick note
because I know some of you will
otherwise ask about it yes we have seen
the RT X 2018 RT X 20 atti performance
information from video cards which was
allegedly sourced from the reviewers
guide because we're testing the cards
right now we can't talk about
performance or comment on those numbers
if you want to see our performance
figures from a wider range of games
using more resolutions you'll have to
wait for our day 1 coverage on Wednesday
and trust me it will be worth it but
there is some new Nvidia art X news that
we can share with you a forum post on
the official GeForce forums has revealed
a slight delay to GeForce r-tx 2080 Ti
general availability the card was
supposed to officially become available
on September 20th but there is now been
a one-week delay pushing that
availability back to September 27th
Nvidia says pre-orders should arrive
between the 20th and 27th the RT X 2080
will still be available on September
20th as planned and there is no change
to when we can talk about performance so
you'll still get to hear how the 28th
ETI performs in just a few days
Nvidia didn't give any reason for the
delay perhaps the same issue caused our
our TX 28 ECI sample to ship out later
than the 2080 sample who knows in any
case we still expect availability to be
very limited on the 20th and 27th for
these cards pre-orders are sold out
basically everywhere and I can't see
there being a huge amount of stock
available on launch day on top of that
pricing will likely remain well above
the AIB MSRP for at least a long while I
reckon the other Nvidia story of this
past week is certainly less interesting
the company announced a further nine
games will support their deep learning
super
sampling or DL SS technology including
Darksiders 3 and hell-blade seniors
sacrifice these games join other titles
like shadow of the Tomb Raider hitman 2
and pub G as a quick note I've heard a
lot of chatter wondering what exactly is
DL SS and Vidya has done you guys
absolutely no favors calling it a super
sampling technique while also pointing
to the supposed performance benefits of
DL SS as I'm sure you're aware super
sampling usually comes at a performance
cost not at a performance gain when
enabled so to clear everything up there
are 2 DL SS modes the standard mode is
simply called de OSS and that renders
the game at a lower than native
resolution Nvidia says the actual
resolution is around 2 times lower but
it varies depending on the game's
implementation so when you have the game
running at 4k with DL SS enabled the
game is actually being rendered below 4k
DLS s then uses an AI network trained on
a 64 times super sample anti-aliased
version of the game to reconstruct the
image back to a 4k presentation you can
sort of think of this DL SS method like
a potentially superior version of
checkerboard rendering or temporal
rendering techniques used with consoles
to play games at 4k while actually
rendering the game at a lower resolution
Nvidia confusingly compares DL SS to taa
or temporal anti-aliasing in their
slides taa is usually applied to a game
running at a native resolution to
provide basic anti-aliasing but I assume
for these comparisons and video is
talking about running at a sub native
resolution than using taa to upscale
personally the more interesting DSS mode
is called DL SS 2x which does not run
the game at a sub native resolution
instead DL SS 2x is more like a
traditional anti-aliasing technique it
runs the game at a native resolution
then uses the AI network to try and
clean up the image to match 64 x super
sample anti areas so in theory this
could be a low-cost a a method like SMA
or fxaa but instead of using basic
processing techniques or just
straight-up blurring the image it's
using the AI network to neatly clean up
jagged edges or other artifacts well
before look into the OSS a bit later but
it certainly sounds quite interesting
this next story is an interesting one if
true
report from the ever unreliable digi
times has suggested Intel is at capacity
with their 14 nanometer fabs and to meet
the demands of their customers has had
to offload some chip production to tsmc
on their equivalent node at this stage
Intel said to offload H 310 production
and several other 300 series chipsets to
their rival fab in the statement to PC
games n Intel didn't exactly deny the
rumors but did say that in response to
the stronger than expected demand
environment we are continuing to invest
in Intel's 14 nanometer manufacturing
capacity that could mean Intel are going
to solely use their own 40 nanometer
fabs for 14 nanometer products or it
could mean they will indeed be
offloading chips to tsmc while they
invest and improve therefore 10
nanometer capacity there has been some
speculation as to why Intel has
allegedly had to move some chips to tsmc
or why their 14 nanometer fabs are at
capacity the obvious candidate for jokes
is Intel continues to really so many 14
nanometer plus plus plus plus processes
but usually each release Intel would
ramp down manufacturing of their old
chips to ramp up production of new ones
the best guess I've heard is in
televising their latest modem to Apple
for use in their new iPhones and this
new modem is produced on a 40 nanometer
process while previous modems used older
nodes so to produce enough modems for
Apple on 14 nanometer there had to ditch
some other less important stuff and push
it to TSMC that's just a guess though I
doubt we'll ever know for sure
last week AMD announced the Rison 320
300 X and Rison 520 500 X 2 very little
fanfare and that's for one reason these
new lower tiers n+ processes for Om zone
lis for the time being the strucker's is
a bit strange as there probably would
have been demand for the 2,300 X and
2500 X among system builders but
regardless they have actually launched
officially now after a few months of
rumors the two CPUs they're quite basic
the ricin 320 300 X is a four core four
threads n+ CPU clocked at 3.5 gigahertz
base with a 4.0 gigahertz turbo the
horizon 5 2500 X includes SMT so it has
4 cores and 8 threads but it's quatrain
the same at a 3.6 gigahertz pace and 4.0
gigahertz turbo
both chips have eight megabytes of level
three cache and a 65 watt TDP I suspect
AMD art so amused to consumers because
they feel the risin 320 200 G and risin
5 2400 G already do what the 2300 X and
2500 X 2 while also providing the
benefit of integrated vega graphics
after all the 2500 g for example is only
clocked slightly lower than the 2500 x
but it also packs in 11 vega compute
units the 2500 x would only make sense
as a cheaper cpu than the 2400 g and
maybe AMD doesn't want to do that not
really sure but at least for the time
being we won't be seeing those new cpus
available for consumers final news topic
of this week IOC has launched a new
series of affordable g1 gaming monitors
there are 4 monitors all up three of
which are basic 1080p models in 24 inch
27 inch and 30 1.5 inch sizes and the
fourth is a 30 1.5 inch 1440p model all
of these displays pack 144 Hertz maximum
refresh rates with free sync support and
all use curved VA panels of either 1800
F with a larger models or 1500 R for the
24 inch model aside from those basic
specs not a lot to discuss it's all
basic VA display specs including 3000 to
1 contrast ratio is 215 it's of maximum
brightness srgb color gamut and one
millisecond MP RT response times which
no doubt will be nowhere near one
millisecond in practice the 27-inch 1080
P g1 monitor is available now for $280
and I put in a request with a OC to
review it so that should be sent out
soon so stay tuned for that the other
models will be available in q4 at prices
of $230 for the 1080p 144 Hertz model
which i think is actually quite a good
price for those specs in a VI panel it
will be $300 for the 32 inch 1080p and
$400 for the 32 inch 1440p alright

the times we don't do that and publish
it on a Monday instead consider

to our exclusive discord chat and of
course look out for our coverage of
invidious r-tx cards starting on
Wednesday with actual performance
information that's it I'll catch
