looking at what is the worst graphics
card ever released well certainly in the
last decade before I continue with that
though imagine you're a gamer on a
seriously tight budget no no it's likely
that a lot of you won't have to be too
creative after all PC gaming is just
something that most of us do to unwind
after a day at work so relax a bit have
a bit of fun so not everyone can afford
to invest hundreds upon hundreds of
dollars in PC gaming when there are
other bills to be paid you might also be
a young kid getting into PC gaming and
computing in general for that matter and
that can be tough for some most parents
are going to be more interested in the
idea of buying a console than a computer
which I feel is a mistake but let's not
get into that here point is these people
don't have endless money to spend on
upgrading or building a new PC so
they're after an affordable graphics
card and more often than not they're
also just getting started on their PC
gaming journey so they aren't super
experienced when it comes to buying a
new graphics card some light research
will show you that sub $100 us graphics
cards such as the GT 1030 is capable of
delivering over 60 fps in fortnight at
1080p using competitive quality settings
so for most that will be enough and
although something like a gtx 1050 is
only about $30 us more the GT 1030 does
what you need so why spend the extra
money of course we could come up with a
few good reasons but we understand why
so many people buy these entry-level
graphics cards so you've seen the
benchmarks you know your system can
produce at least 60 FPS with the GeForce
GT 1030 so you buy one for the typical
asking price of $90 us however what you
don't know is that not all GT 1030
graphics cards are the same not even
close you could buy a GT 1030 that will
indeed spit out over 60 fps in fortnight
at 1080p or you could be getting one
that barely keeps the framerate above 30
fps the problem for you is they both
have the same name the exact same name
you might expect the version that's
around 50% slower it'd be called
something like the GT 1030 alley or GT
1030 se or better yet a completely
different name like the GT 1020 for
example
instead though NVIDIA has decided to
grossly misled customers into thinking
lgt 1030 graphics cards are equal so
what exactly is going on here then well
more than a year ago now back in May of
2017 and video released the GT 1030 as
the most affordable GPU in the GeForce
ten series it came in an MSRP of just
$70 u.s. and packed on an 84 CUDA cores
clocked at 1.2 eight gigahertz with a
boost frequency of one point four seven
gigahertz and the gddr5 memory was
clocked at 1.5 gigahertz and using a
mere 64-bit wide memory bus provided a
bandwidth of 48 gigabytes per second the
GT 1030 wasn't blowing any socks off but
it was what it was an ultra affordable
current generation GPU however as of
March 2018 budget shoppers could no
longer buy a GT 1030 and know exactly
what they were getting at least without
taking note of the type of memory used
this is because Nvidia quietly
introduced a ddr4 version using the type
of memory modern desktop PCs use as
system memory this is a massive problem
because ddr4 memory is significantly
slower than gddr5 memory firstly the
memory base frequency has been reduced
by 30% and as bad as that sounds the end
result is far worse gddr5 memory has two
parallel links which provide double the
i/o throughput when compared to ddr4
this means the memory frequency has
actually been reduced by 65% and because
we're still using the same 64 bit wide
memory bus this also means the memory
bandwidth has been reduced by 65 percent
down from an already anemic 48-year
bytes per second the end result sees the
ddr4 version of the GT 1030 with a 16
point eight gigabytes per second link to
its two gigabyte memory buffer that's
only slightly more bandwidth in the
mis√©rable ddr3 version of the geforce GT
730 released back in 2014 then for
whatever reason NVIDIA has also cut down
the core frequency dropping the ddr4
version down to one point one five
gigahertz which is a six percent
reduction okay so the ddr4 version has
way less memory bandwidth but has the
same name and looking around online
seems to come in and about the same
price so as a potential GT 1030
how worried should you be Nvidia didn't
feel the need to change the name so can
it really be that different well we're
about to find out for testing all
graphics cards were benchmarked on our
core i3 80-100 test system with 8
gigabytes of ddr4 2666 memory and also
thrown in for comparison is the Rison 5
2400 G APU using its integrated vaguer
11 graphics with 8 gigabytes of ddr4
2666 memory ok let's get into the
results for testing battlefield 1 we've
gone with the low quality preset now
normally we test low-end graphics cards
and even ap use with the medium quality
settings in this title but at 720p the
GT 1030 ddr4 version was barely able to
deliver playable performance using the
low quality preset did allow for 51 FPS
on average and that doesn't seem too bad
that is until you realize the gddr5
version is 104 percent faster moving to
1080p and now the ddr4 version of the GT
1030 can't even achieve 30 FPS using the
lowest possible quality settings are you
kidding me The Horizon 520 400g apu is
64% faster and way worse than that is
the fact that the gddr5 version the
original GT 1030 is 118 percent faster
118 % I'm not even sure what to say
about that right now so let's just move
on using the lowest possible quality
settings in pray at 720p the G ddr4 GT
1030 did manage to average just over 60
fps and again that meant the gddr5 model
was roughly twice as fast upping the
resolution of 1080p and now the gddr5
model is more than twice as fast as the
pathetic ddr4 version again we see that
with the lowest possible quality
settings enabled the ddr4 version can't
even achieve 30 FPS on average far cry 5
is a new title and it's fairly well
optimized but if you bought the ddr4
version of the GT 1030 you're gonna have
a bad time even at 720p using the lowest
possible quality things we couldn't
average 30 fps
meanwhile the gddr5 model was almost 80%
faster and that's the smallest much and
we've seen yet here are the cherry pea
results and really what can you say
even the gddr5 version of the GT 1030
sucks here but the ddr4 model it's
really something else
pure garbage is what it is although dirt
4 was playable using the lowest possible
quality settings it was still a far cry
from what the gddr5 versions are capable
of at 1080p the ddr4 version dips well
below 60 FPS while the gddr5 model was
able to keep the framerate above 80 FPS
at all times I suspect a lot of the GT
1030 graphics cards currently being
purchased by those wanting to get into
fortnight and if true those who got
caught out by the ddr4 version will be
livid
results like these will show the GT 1030
pushing over 100 FPS at all times using
the medium quality settings at 720p the
duty r4 version though struggles to get
the dips above 60 FPS but I guess it's
playable so there is that of course most
won't want to play at 720p if they can
avoid it and avoid it they can't with
the ddr4 version here we see just 38 FPS
on average will hold the original GT
1030 span at an average of 66 fps moving
on the rocket link and here we see just
60 FPS an average of 720p using the
in-game quality preset named quality in
this instance the gddr5 model was almost
90% faster with 114 FPS on average then
at 1080p the G ddr4 GT 1030 scrapes by
with 32 FPS on average and at this more
memory intensive resolution the gddr5
model was 122 % faster just ridiculous
that is the last game we're going to
look at is Rainbow six siege and here we
see even when using the lowest possible
quality options at 720p the ddr4 GT 1030
is good for 73 FPS which isn't bad apart
from the fact that the gddr5 model is
almost 80% faster with 130 FPS then once
again at 1080p this seriously limited
ddr4 models performance is heavily
limited and here we saw an average of
just 39 FPS making the gddr5 model 65%
fast
now not that it matters in the least but
here are the power consumption figures
because the memory is choking the GPU
the ddr4 version uses less power
reducing total system consumption by 16%
that said given we often saw a 50%
reduction in performance that actually
makes the TDR for version significantly
worse in terms of performance per watt
Wow where do I even start with a product
like this I'm actually still coming to
terms with the fact that this product
even exists how the bloody hell does
this exist actually I should be clear
about this as rubbish as this ddr4
version of the GT 1030 years I don't
have too much of a problem with its
existence it probably shouldn't exist
but the fact that it does isn't the real
issue here the real issue is Nvidia had
the goal to call it a GT 1030
and not a GT 1020 for example I don't
even know how they can get away with
doing that as we saw it was often 50%
slower than the gddr5 version yet it has
the exact same name and price again how
is this possible it's not like we were
trying to cripple performance or test
under some unusual condition either to
make it look worse than it really is
almost all the games tested we're done
so using the lowest possible quality
preset at 720p and 1080p the gddr5 model
can actually handle higher visual
quality settings at 1080p and doing so
would further cripple the ddr4 version
so we're actually showing a best-case
scenario if anything I can't imagine how
up side be if I've been saving up bit by
bit for weeks on end to upgrade my
graphics card only to end up with that
thing I'd never trust in video again I
also couldn't imagine ever buying a
geforce product for the rest of my life
and I'd also be very upset with the
retail
sobbing the product even though I
probably realize at the time that it
wasn't necessarily their fault actually
that led me to reach out to a few of our
local retail to see what their take was
on the ddr4 version of the GT 1030 and
do they ever see any kind of backlash
from this sort of thing for obvious
reasons I won't name any of the
retailers but I can tell you what they
told me and they all said pretty much
the same thing for
the big issue for retailers is that they
often don't know the exact models that
they're buying and I know that sounds a
bit silly but it doesn't make sense the
people in these purchasing roles often
aren't computer geeks computer nerds
whatever term you'd like to use there
and they pay attention to things like
product codes and pricing not the type
of memory the graphics card uses they'll
see that GT 1030 stock is low and
they'll order more GT 1030 stock and
it's not like each brand only has a
single GT 1030 model even before the
ddr4 mass most brands offered four to
five different models it sounds like a
lot of the people in these purchasing
roles unknowingly bought up ddr4 GT 1030
stock just assuming it was the same
gddr5 models that they'd been buying for
the past year the specs are often
supplied and then just copy and paste it
onto the website and again this isn't
anything unusual almost all of them
admitted that if it wasn't for the
controversy around the spec change they
would have been none the wiser and it
would have been just pure chance if they
happen to notice the change at all
they also said unless the model name has
changed or there is some obvious
difference this stuff generally goes
under the radar this then causes massive
issues for these retailers as they are
unknowingly selling their customers
inferior products and that's not
something they want to do for obvious
reasons a reputation really is
everything in this business so Nvidia
aren't just hurting their customers
they're also hurting the retailers as
well as their own board partners this
really is a bad look for anyone involved
again I really don't know how this kind
of thing happens in the first place but
yes I am painfully aware this isn't the
first time a new video has done
something like this and I also aware
that AMD recently dabbled with the dodgy
naming as well though nothing as
horrific as this anyway this kind of
crap has to stop and I hope big
youtubers you know the guys with 1
million plus hubs and other large media
outlets do their own testing and show
their viewers and readers what's going
on here
I think gamers Nexus were the first of
the punch on this one showing actual
benchmarks late last month so good on
them for doing that great work as always
we were a bit slow getting this dumpster
fire down under but tea now so fellow
Ozzy's be warned we were always in video
right gonna be too happy with this video
and we won't be surprised if we don't
receive samples for the
generation GPU launch be a real shame if
that is the case but if it is not the
end of the world we'll just have to buy
the GPUs ourselves and on that note if
you would like to support us directly
and gain access to a few cool perks like
our discord chat monthly livestream then
you can check out our patreon account
the link is in the video description
anyway I hope you enjoyed this video I'm
your host Steve and I'll see you again
