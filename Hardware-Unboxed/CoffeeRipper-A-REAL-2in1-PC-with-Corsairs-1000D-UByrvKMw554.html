checking out the brand new Corsair
obsidian series 1000 a super tower case
I wouldn't say this is going to be a
comprehensive review but it will be
certainly more involved in a simple
overview and of course I will be
installing the foundations for well my
mega build let me just start though by
saying that for this content there's
been a little more fumbling around in
the dark than usual for a few reasons
firstly I have no instructions at all no
manual nothing I guess the manual wasn't
included with this early production run
and of course it hasn't provided me with
any digital copy either so there hasn't
really been much to go on for this one I
have no specifications or no spec sheet
no official facts or figures so I've had
to work out pretty much everything for
myself what I do know is that it's
called the obsidian 1000d because the
name was on the box and it's bloody big
ridiculously big as you can no doubt
already tell this build will replace the
obsidian 500e that was here the 1000 a
hasn't crushed the computer was
previously here I just took it apart and
removed it oh yes this is the new
background PC for all my videos and it
won't just sit here as a showpiece I
will use it from time to time don't
mostly just for gaming ok so let's talk
about the video title for a minute
coffee Ripper I had initially thought to
call this build sky Ripper as the plan
was to use that little asrock mini ITX
x-29 board that you might have seen a
build that I did quite recently and then
I was gonna stick the core I know in
79-80 XE on that why not and then also
put in the MSI x3 nine damning Pro with
the thread rip in nineteen fifty X and
if you're a little confused at this
point I should mention that this super
Tower can fit two desktop systems but I
suppose given the size it's hardly
surprising having thought through the
initial plans a bit more though it
became clear that while very insane kind
of Awesome the skyriver build was
ultimately a bit pointless that's
assuming you don't need to productivity
monsters in the same
case the problem I have right now and I
admit it's somewhat of a high-class
problem but the problem I currently face
is that my main PC uses the msi extra
known gaming Pro carbon with the thread
Ripper 1950 ex it's a great system and
it makes my video editing and encoding
work a breeze however from time to time
I do like to actually relax and play a
few games I'm not benchmarking them and
while the 1950 ex is fine for the most
part that's not the ideal gaming
solution I have run into a few little
problems here and there and well I know
there is a better gaming experience to
be had so as a result I sometimes find
myself playing on my core i7 87 oh okay
test system and because that's used
primarily for benchmarking and not
gaming it's not really the ideal setup
that being the case I think it makes
more sense to drop the sky like X
portion of this build and replace it
with a coffee like a core i7 87 or okay
so that's what I'll be doing meeting
that this build houses an 8700 K gaming
rig along with a 1950 X workstation and
that's the stuff of dreams okay so time
to talk about the star of the show the
corsair obsidian series 1000 d some of
you might have caught wind of this super
tell a few months ago when corsair and
amazon accidentally leaked information
about the upcoming case I'm actually
surprised this didn't happen sooner as I
agreed to a 1000 day embargo with
Corsair way back in December of 2017 the
plan at the time was to create a build
series in January but due to various
issues the release day was pushed back
till now although I don't know for sure
I assume there was some kind of
production issue with the front glass
panel which features curved edges in the
leaked photos but this has now been
replaced with a flat glass panel which
doesn't really look as sleek but
possibly allows for greater airflow so
it's likely a more practical solution in
that sense so the 1000 d is the new
flagship case from Corsair and it's
expected to cost about $500 u.s. which
is a lot but for the case of this
caliber it's actually surprisingly
reasonable at least in my opinion and
I'll talk a little bit more about that
towards the end of the video for now
let's go over the specs so the case
measures six hundred and ninety three
millimeters long and
it's 697 millimeters tall and then it's
307 millimeters deep or wide whichever
one you prefer basically though that
gives it a volume of 148 liters and that
makes the 1000 a roughly 30% larger than
the 900 d and well that was already a
comically large computer case the 900 d
was also incredibly heavy at 18 point 6
kilograms but brace yourself because the
1000 d has packed on quite a few extra
kilos and is now almost 60% heavier at a
whopping 28 point five kilograms
forget about your back though what's the
structural integrity of your desk like
the reason for the massive increase in
weight is largely due to these just
absolutely huge plus side panels and
there is a glass panel on both sides of
the case then we have the glass panel on
the front of the case and then there's a
neat little strip across the top of the
case which is also made out of glass the
1000d follows the styling of the 500 d
the case that I had here previously and
well in my opinion I think that's a good
thing because I really liked the styling
of that case and it had a bit more
character than the Obsidian models that
came before it
so like the 500 d you do get those
fantastic door hinges they're beefed up
on this model obviously because we have
this gigantic
glass panel and if the glass panel is
again fixed in place via our magnets if
I just there you go that holds it quite
nicely you don't really have to worry
about the doors swinging open when you
move the case because there is just
absolutely no way you're moving this
case with the two glass panels on so you
would remove them first and then attempt
to move this beast and even if you had
big arms Tim by your side it would still
be a big job ok so I'm not going to
cover every last detail of the 1000 d in
this video because it would be a half
hour long video of the case and I don't
really have all the components to do it
justice just yet
so rather I'll quickly just point out
the design aspects and features of the
case that I really liked and then
mention a few things that I feel can be
improved things that are awesome and
worked really well include the removable
dust filters which I'll show you some
b-roll of those but basically you open
the door up and then there's a big
filter at the
and a big filter at the front there's
also one at the bottom for the PSU vo
getting at those panels is really easy
and then you can clean them out slide
them back in it won't slow down too much
the i/o panel at the top is fantastic
there's enough USB ports there for two
systems and you can figure those however
you like some can be attached to the
mini ITX rig in the bottom while others
can just go on the full-size ATX system
and there's also a pair of USB type-c
ports which is of course very welcomed
those of you wondering only the power
and reset buttons for the main ATX rig
are found on the front io and then
around the back you will find the power
and reset buttons for the little I TX
system one of the coolest features are
the fan trays but the 500 d these were
removable so you could install the fans
and radiators outside of the case and
that just made the installation process
a bit easier and then once you were done
you two slotted the trays with
everything and still back in very nice
system that the 1000 D though takes this
concept to the next level with sliding
rails for much easier access the trays
unlock by a single thumb screw and slide
right out of the case this is a
seriously cool design element that made
installing the 11 fans in the front and
top of the case just a breeze in total
you can install 13 fans 8 120 millimeter
fans in the front which is what I've
done then you can put 3 140 millimeter
fans in the top and again this is what
I've done and then you are meant to be
able to put 2 120 millimeter or 140
millimeter fans in the rear which is a
bit strange because I couldn't actually
get a pair of ML 140 fans in the rear of
the case they just simply didn't fit and
upon closer inspection there's only 260
millimetres of space here so I'm not
sure how you're meant to squeeze 280
millimetres worth of fans there it's a
bit odd that at the front of the case
down the front panel here there is a 20
millimeter gap on either side and that
allows for airflow and while a
ventilated panel would have no doubt
increased air flow this design isn't
really that restrictive and with 8 front
mounted 120 millimeter fans you can just
feel boatloads of air being sucked
through this panel here so I don't think
airflow is going to be a problem in this
case the top panel also features four
main ventilated sections each run the
entire length of the case and
have a height of about 10 millimeters so
overall that is a large open sectional
at airflow into the top or out of the
case other feet also raise the case
about 20 millimeters up off the desk or
whatever surface you have it on a
ventilation here isn't really an issue
but you do have the PSU which will be
drawing or could be configured to draw
in cool air from under the case so
that's important and the feet to extend
the entire length of the case there
homemade out of aluminium and they are
quite strong because well the case is
extremely heavy around on the opposite
side of the case the 1000 D takes cable
management to the next level with a pair
of barn doors open them up though and
you have a massive sort of basement
section or back section whatever you
want to call it and here we have a pre
installed Commander Pro half-a-dozen two
and a half inch drive trays five three
and a half inch drive trays and a whole
lot of space for hiding cable mess which
I very much appreciated in this build
was all that RGB fan action at the
basement section is 490 millimeters wide
490 millimeters tall and 70 millimeters
deep now the left side door reveals a
massive interior ready to take advantage
of an open-loop cooling system or well a
few of them with just the fans installed
like what I've done there is five
hundred and eighteen millimeters worth
of clearance for graphics cards so it's
fair to say you could install a super
thick radiator in a push-pull
configuration without any issues there
it's also possible to install air
coolers like what I've done and they
could stand as tall as 195 millimeters
but this really isn't a case where you
want to be using air coolers sadly this
is how I'm forced to configure my system
for now but in the future I do plan a
rather crazy open-loop system finally
the PSU shroud does limit the power
supply lengths to around 220 millimeters
as you still need to squeeze the cables
in that space for such a massive case
this does seem a little limiting that
said you should be able to cram in
something like the Corsair ax 1500 I
without much trouble installing the ATX
PSU is a bit of a pain as you do need to
remove the shroud and this means
disassembling the ITX system if you've
already installed that there doesn't
appear to be any other way of installing
or removing
PSU or adjusting the cables at least as
far as I can determine without an actual
manual a removable bracket at the rear
of the case probably would have helped
with this issue so it's a bit annoying
that caller says overlooked this the
same is also true for the SFX power
supply but because that's located in the
basement or back section you can access
that directly without much trouble one
thing I will note is that I feel like
the entire ATX motherboard tray needs to
be shifted up about 20 millimeters now
this would give the ITX system more
Headroom and improve compatibility I'm
really not sure why there's so much
Headroom in the top of the case even
with a 60 millimeter thick radiator and
a push-pull configuration you'd still
have a good 30 millimetres of clearance
between the motherboard and the fans
other really fair location also needs to
be stretched out a bit so you can
actually install a pair of 140
millimeter fans I'd also like the
ability to mount a 120 millimeter fan
just here behind the graphics card or
just in front of the ITX motherboard so
on top of the PSU shroud oh this is just
help force a bit more air over the ITX
boards of erm and really this is a much
needed feature when you install
something like a core i7 8700 k so the
1008 isn't perfect in my opinion but
it's still pretty close and I don't
really see any deal-breakers here's
especially for those wanting just an
absolutely outrageous build using custom
liquid cooling again I do plan to liquid
cool my 1000d build and it will happen
in a future video so just remain patient
for that I know I have to for now though
I have installed the foundations which
include the MSI x-ray no motherboard
along with the thread ribbon nineteen
fifty X and a Vegas 64 graphics card and
then of course for the ITX gaming build
we do have the MSI Zen 370 I damming Pro
carbon AC with the core i7 87 okay and
then of course the geforce gtx 1080 TI
gaming extra oh that's impressive that
the 1000 d actually manages to make the
gaming extra look somewhat small i mean
it's a truly massive graphics card and
just look at it in there look at it
little guy for now i filled the case
with corsair ml series fans and they
will remain in place when i upgrade to
the liquid cooling radiators and a lot
of stuff hopefully in the not too
distant future either 1000d i'm it looks
very barren with that
liquid cooling in there obviously this
case is designed to take advantage of
liquid cooling and something like the
thermal take the tower 900 without
liquid cooling it really just doesn't
make sense so you can imagine a pump and
reservoir here maybe two of them some
massive radiators here and here and some
hard shoes running all over the place
it's going to look pretty awesome I
think the Corsair 1000 II is a super
impressive super Tower and at the
suspected $500 u.s. price tag it's
actually quite reasonable I think
considering everything you get in the
build quality but talking about the
value aspect of such a product probably
is a waste of time I imagine even at
$500 the 1000d will be one of the
cheaper components featured in almost
every build destined to end up inside
this behemoth this really isn't the kind
of case you'd even consider if your
budget didn't have a five digit number
attached to it I can already imagine
some of the comments in the comments
section below but let me just say that
yeah its massive and it's over the top
but that's the point of course it's more
practical to build two separate systems
so separate damming and a separate
workstation PC are two systems in a
single case doesn't really make that
much sense but that doesn't mean it's
not awesome because well it very much is
even though two separate systems is more
practical for a number of reasons I
personally would go for something like
the 1000 d just the wow factor alone and
it's just a lot of fun building in it
and something a bit different and if
you're gonna be spending that kind of
money on two systems potentially then
why don't make it one really big unique
one and well that is going to do it for
this one if you enjoy the video then be
