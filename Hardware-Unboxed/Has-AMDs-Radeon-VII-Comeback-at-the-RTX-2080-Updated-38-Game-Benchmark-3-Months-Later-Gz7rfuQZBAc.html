fact that I didn't open with welcome
back to harbor unboxed besides from that
what's weird is every single video we've
published over the last few weeks has
had at least one comment asking for a
Radeon seven retest doesn't really
matter what the video is a review on a
monitor from team or just any other
unrelated content someone's jumped in
and requested we revisit the Radeon
seven and we've had hundreds upon
hundreds of requests over the last few
weeks I'm honestly not entirely sure why
there's so much interest in a Radeon
seven re test since release there hasn't
really been any major driver
improvements so nothing should have
really changed there that said there
have been a few new games release that
do worker very well with radio and GPUs
but again I'm not really convinced
that'll change much anyway because so
many of you have requested an update I
thought why not give the people what
they want so today we have a 38 game
benchmark covering the 1440p and 4k
resolutions but before that today's
video sponsor is nord vp and right now
they're offering harbor on box viewers
75% off a three-year membership when you
use the link in the video description
and that works out to be just two
dollars ninety nine per month which in
my opinion is a very small price to pay
for your internet security allowing you
to browse download and shop safely
hardware and box gets bombarded with
advertising opportunities from VPN
services and today nord VPN is the only
company we've worked with that's for
good reason it's the only service we use
and trust i've tried a number of
different services and they all came up
short for one reason or another but I
can honestly say Nord VPN is the best
I've found and having been a customer
for well over a year now I highly
recommend you check them out Nord VPN
also offers a free 30-day money-back
guarantee so start protecting your
Internet experience they were 75% off a
three-year plan by using code Harbor
unboxed at Nord VPN comm forward slash
Harbor unboxed link is in the video
description okay so hopefully you're now
safely watching this video with Nord VPN
and we can proceed so some quick
backstory here
the AMD Radeon seven was first released
on February 7th and it really is the AMD
Radeon 7 you can buy it with sapphire
asrock XFX
MSI or Sue's gigabyte or power color
branding but they're all the same
AMD designed Radeon 7 so it's kind of
boring so yeah today there is no custom
AIB model that straps on a big oversized
cooler to bring down operating
temperatures as well as the operating
volume still the AMD reference design
does look pretty good in fact I actually
quite liked it but out of the box
without any kind of tinkering it kind of
sucks like it's really loud and I know
you guys are king for me to unnerve alt
Radeon 7 and do some benchmarking tuned
up for better performance and all that
but yeah I'll get to that soon for now I
just wanted to get a baseline retest out
of the way since for some reason this
has been quite heavily requested as for
the pricing the MSRP is $700 u.s. and
nothing has changed here in the past
three months the typical asking price is
$700 u.s. and over here in Australia you
can expect to pay around eleven hundred
and fifty ozzie dollars alternatively
there's the GeForce r-tx 2080 and it
also has a $700 US MSRP and that's also
the typical asking price though over
here in Australia it's possible to snag
one for 1,050 dollars
so down under it's $100 cheaper than the
Radeon seven no but I did my initial
Radeon 7 mega benchmark video covering
33 games I found that on average it was
7% slower than the GeForce r-tx 2080 and
of the 33 games tested the Vega 20 GP
was faster by a 5 percent margin or
greater in just 4 of the titles
meanwhile the RT x 2080 was faster by 5%
margin or greater in 23 of the games
tested so not a great start for the
Radeon 7 and it meant in all good
conscience I just couldn't recommend
viewers purchase AMD's new flagship
gaming GPU and yes this thing has been
absolutely pitched to us as a gaming
products so let's not pretend that it's
designed exclusively for content
creators or whatever else people are
coming up with apart from offering more
consistent performance the RT x 2080
also consumed quite a bit less power and
that's a nice bonus not a main selling
point but is an eye
bonus and then to cap it all off there's
literally dozens upon dozens of custom
AIB models to choose from and I have to
say almost all of which are very good
but it's no longer February 2019 its May
2019 apparently that means a retest is
in order so I guess let's do that as
usual go over the results for just a
dozen of the newer or more interesting
titles and then we'll do a head-to-head
comparison with all 38 games for
detailed information on the results for
the other 26 games that we won't be
analyzing closely please check our
patreon page for all those graphs they
will be made available for free as usual
our course a GPU test rig built inside
the crystal series 570 X has been used
and inside we have a core I nine nine -
okay clocked at five-year hits with 32
gigabytes of ddr4 3400 memory
representing the green team is the
gigabyte our TX 20 80 horas extreme and
for the red team
well the AMD Radeon 7 the latest
available drivers at the time of testing
had been used and our results have been
updated so I think that's about
everything let's get into the good stuff
first up we have Rage 2 and here the
Radeon 7 and GeForce r-tx 20/80 are very
evenly matched in fact we can safely
call this one a tie traditionally you
would have expected AMD to get the upper
hand in a Vulcan exclusive title but
with the improvements in videos made to
the cheering architecture that is no
longer the case moving on we have World
War Z and this is another Vulcan title
though this one also supports DirectX 11
but NVIDIA has also addressed their
Vulcan performance in this tunnel so
it's no longer an issue even so this is
still a strong title for AMD and here
the Radeon 7 was 18% faster at 1440p
though interestingly that margin is
reduced to just 6 percent at the 4k
resolution we also saw recently that the
Radeon RX 5 value enjoyed a slight
performance advantage over the gtx 1066
gigabyte and apex legends however that's
not the case for the radeon GPU in this
comparison here the r-tx 20/80 smoked
the Radeon 7 by a 24% margin at 1440p
and almost 30% at 4k I should note
though the margins in this total do vary
quite a bit depending on where you test
and the section I used for repeatability
is admittedly not that demanding so like
I said it favored
in the RX 580 comparison that just not
here against a churring GPU the division
2 also uses a low-level API this time
DirectX 12 and again this is a title
where the RX 5 are you smoked the GTX
1060 however this time we see again that
Radeon 7 is struggling to keep pace with
the r-tx 2080
and here the GeForce GPU was 10% faster
at both the tested resolutions
performance in shadow of the Tomb Raider
is very competitive and although the RT
X 2080 does offer a small performance
bump over the Radeon 7 for the most part
the experience was much the same that's
it I again have to make note this was
yet another title with the rx 580 smoked
the GTX 1060 but no such luck for Radeon
7 in its battle with churring the
Assassin's Creed Odyssey results are
also quite competitive though once again
the RT X 2080 does manage to edge out
the Radeon 7 this time offering 7% more
performance at 1440p and 9% more a at 4k
Resident Evil 2 is yet another title
where the rx 580 destroyed of the GTX
1060 but here we see the Radeon 7
playing second fiddle to the RT X 2080
to be fair the radeon GPU wasn't much
slower but in this comparison it was
indeed slower fortnight was actually one
of the few tiles where the rx 580 did
get blitzed by the GTX 1060 so that
doesn't bode particularly well for the
Radeon 7 in its battle with the RT X
2080 and as you can see here the GeForce
GPU was 26% faster at both the tested
resolutions so I guess then as expected
a rather poor result for AMD in this
title metro Exodus isn't in via
sponsored title but even so the rx 580
did beat the GTX 1060 in this one here
though the Radeon 7 can't keep up with
the RT X 2080 and it's another
comfortable win for the green team
traditionally AMD has done very well in
Rainbow six siege but here the Radeon 7
gets smoked once again by the RT X 2080
as the GeForce GPU was 17% faster at
1440p and 21% faster at 4k and that
extra performance at 4k really does make
quite a big difference one title where
Radeon 7 does get the better of the RT X
2080 is battlefield 5 and no DXi isn't
enabled here the radeon GPU was 11%
faster at both
test of resolution so a good result for
AMD Radeon seven also manages to eke out
a win in Far Cry new dawn beating the RT
X 2080 by a slim margin at both tested
resolutions generally though I deem
anything less than a 5% margin to be a
tie so fair to say they are pretty well
tied in this title okay so I have to say
that didn't seem overly positive for the
Radeon seven but it was just a dozen of
the 38 games tested so let's grab all 38
games compare these two GPUs
head-to-head in a single graph so we can
get a clearer picture of what's going on
well then not a lot has changed here
three months ago we found the Radeon
seven to be 7% slower at 1440p and today
it's 8 percent slower despite a few new
titles added to the mix World War Z has
been a good addition for AMD but beyond
that title such as Rage 2 anthem dirt
rally to the division 2 apex Legends
generation 0 and in particular Ace
Combat 7 Skye's unknown have not been so
positive you might hear arguments that
try to leverage the radio and sevens
massive 16 gigabyte vm buffer suggesting
that because of the extra memory it's a
superior choice for 4k gaming however
the evidence that we have here strongly
contradicts that argument at 4k the
Radeon 7 fell slightly further behind
the RCX 2080 and now there's just a
single example where it's fast about a
5% margin or greater so at least for now
4k is not the savior of the Radeon 7
let's rewind a little bit here I
concluded my initial mega Radeon 7
benchmark video by saying the following
as for the Radeon 7.2 much more needs to
be said at this point really if you felt
our day 1 review was too harsh well upon
reflection I don't we reviewed it
exclusively as a gaming product as we
always do with graphics cards and
frankly they're under delivered if it
happened to be more efficient than the
RT X 2080 and ran really quiet I deem it
a worthy alternative but let's not
sugarcoat this I'll beat around the bush
it's not as efficient it's loud and for
the most part it's slower only a little
slower but it is slower and if for some
reason you think we're Nvidia shells or
something crazy like that I
would urge you to go back and watch our
day one RTX 2080 and 2070 coverage
because it was not favorable but the
radion seven has managed to make the
r-tx 2080 look pretty good in today's
climate now three months later what's
changed well as you just saw not much
really we've had multiple driver
releases availability of the radio and
sevens pretty decent now but ultimately
nothing's really changed so I completely
stand by my initial comments made in my
Radeon seven review in the mega
benchmark video and unless something
like under vaulting can deliver well I
think it's fair to say deliver
unexpected and almost impossible
improvements then I'm not recommending
the Radeon seven and let's be honest
this thing you'd need at least a twenty
percent improvement in performance with
a substantial reduction in power
consumption and a pretty epic
improvement in operating volume to
justify the need for such tinker II and
then let's not forget you can also tweak
or tune the RT X 2080 and without much
issue you can squeeze about another 10%
out of that and it doesn't really have
much impact on power draw or operating
volume and well that's pretty good given
that the AIB models are virtually silent
to begin with and I think that's really
gonna do it for this one and other guys
who are big fans of Radeon GPUs and AMD
in general which is always a bit foolish
in my opinion they're just companies
trying to make as much money as they can
but I know the guys that have been
wanting me to push the radio in seven
won't be too happy with this video but
well we always strive to be as honest as
possible and give you guys the most
accurate information as possible and I
just can't in good conscience recommend
this over the RT X 2080 for all the
reasons we just come and anyway if you
do appreciate us being as honest as we
possibly can then hit the like button
you can subscribe for more honesty and
you can also support us directly on our
patreon page and that will give you
access to our discord chat where you can
pick our brain or just chat to us in
general and you'll also get access to
our monthly live stream that tune myself
do together anyway thank you for
watching may be an under vault video
with this coming in the near future I'm
not gonna squeeze that in before
Computex
but if you guys still think that's worth
doing then I'll do it but I'm not
expecting any miracles right yeah thanks
for watching I'm your host Steve see
again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
