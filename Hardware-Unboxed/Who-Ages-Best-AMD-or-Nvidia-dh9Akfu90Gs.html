change when it comes to GPUs the arrival
of the Radeon HD 7970 for AMD was a big
deal back in January of 2012 as we saw
the birth of the gcn 1.0 architecture
and crucially the first step to the 28
nanometer design process the 7970 was a
huge step forward from the 6970 before
it at the time was on average 40% faster
likewise for Nvidia the GeForce GTX 680
marked the transition down from 40
nanometers to 28 nanometers assuring and
improved them performance and power
consumption upon release the GTX 680 was
faster less power-hungry and quieter
than the 7970 which would see AMD
release an overclocked 7970 called the
gigahertz edition three months later
since then the 7970 was rebadged as
radiant r9 280x in 2013 whilst AMD
pushed their design further to create
the 290 X which was later rebadged as
the 390 X with twice as much VRAM
finally AMD reached the limits of what
was possible with the design on the 28
nanometer process when they created the
monstrous fury acts with 4096 SPU's in
2015 and video 2 has been constrained to
the 28 nanometer process though there
have been a little more productive in my
opinion the Kepler architecture was
mostly dumped in late 2014 to make way
for the new Maxwell GPUs which are more
efficient and more powerful one might
think that this change to a more
efficient architecture was a good thing
for NVIDIA fans but for many of the
opposite seem true the problem started
when gamers began to notice a rather
large discrepancy in performance between
Kepler and Maxwell most noticeably in
modern game works titles such as The
Witcher 3 some went as far to say in
video is deliberately gimping
performance on the previous generation
GPUs in an effort to force the consumer
to upgrade I think that theory has
mostly been debunked now and instead it
seems much more likely than a video
simply forgotten their older generation
GPUs when it comes to performance
optimizations focusing their efforts
solely on Maxwell given in videos in the
business of making money about selling
new products and not keeping second-hand
shoppers happy this makes sense from a
business perspective however if they
were deliberately
and decapping the older products that
would be another issue but if they're
simply forgetting about them then that's
the pitfall of buying their products but
is it can you really expect your ultra
expensive shiny new NVIDIA GPU to be
near useless once the next generation
lands I've seen plenty of articles and
videos that compare Kepler based GPUs
using new and old drivers to Maxwell
with mixed results yes there are
instances where Kepler GPUs such as the
GTX 780 4 well behind the new GTX 970 in
some modern games but it is hard to pin
that entirely on the driver after all
Maxwell is a more efficient architecture
and under the right conditions
considerably more efficient in fact if
the GTX 970 was merely a rebadged 780
with more vram up bloody Hal I've gone
and done it
I mentioned vram when talking about GTX
970 where was I run
if the GTX 970 was merely a rebadged 780
with more vram than you wouldn't expect
or accept discrepancies in performance
from playing modern titles anyway let's
just get to the point very soon
consumers will have access to the next
generation AMD and NVIDIA GPUs for many
longevity will play a key role in their
purchasing decisions I wanted to find
out the truth and I didn't want to do it
by comparing two different Nvidia
architectures instead I'll be taking the
GeForce GTX 680 and comparing it to the
Radeon HD 7970
for testing I pick nine games from
around the time the GTX 680 in HD 7970
were released in 2012 all of which were
popular choices for benchmarking these
GPUs so we can safely assume both cancel
well optimized following that I then
went ahead and benchmark no more
recently released games most of them
very recently such as rise of the Tomb
Raider black ops 3 Far Cry primal and
the division for example once the dust
settles I'll be looking at how the two
compared in the older games compared to
the newer games to see if there's any
performance discrepancies both graphics
cards will be tested using the default
AMD and NVIDIA specifications and please
note we are using the original 7970 not
the overclocked gigahertz edition card
I'm not particularly interested in which
card is faster but rather the
performance margins that separate them
and if they change over time first up
let's look at the older games from
around 2012 please note I will be
focusing on the 1080p performance
have also included the 1440p results for
those interested the 7970 was 7% faster
in Batman Arkham City when comparing the
average frame rate this time the GTX 680
was just 3% faster in battlefield 3 now
when testing with Crysis 2 we find the
7970 is now 3% faster though it did
suffer from a considerably lower minimum
frame rate the 7970 stays on top for
dirt showdown with a 4% lead the GTX 680
hits the lead once again winning by a 7%
margin in hard reset this time the GTX
680 was 7% faster in Max Payne 3 man I
had some fun with that game all those
years ago Metro 2033 was taken by the
7970 by a rather decisive 17% margin
using total war Shogun 2 we found that
7970 was 13% faster finally rounding out
the old-school gaming is another
favorite stalker Call of Pripyat this
test resulted in a dead heat with the
cards tied at 65 FPS each now for the
newer titles these are all modern titles
that I use regularly to bench my new
GPUs now mostly selected at random the
GTX 680 was 3% faster in battlefield 3
and surprise surprise was again 3%
faster when testing the fourth and
current installment these are the most
shocking results seen so far
here the 7970 was found to be 33% faster
than the GTX 680 could this be a sign of
what's to come yet another strong win
for the 7970 this time when testing f1
2015 here it's able to get 14% ahead of
the GTX 680 the Far Cry primal results
are a bit mixed the 7970 was on average
2 percent faster
despite being 15% slower when comparing
the minimum frame rate again this time
when testing Just Cause 3 we find the
7970 was faster on average but much
slower when comparing the minimum frame
rate Star Wars Battlefront provides
another big win for the 7970 as was
found to be 16% faster when comparing
the average frame rate the 7970 stayed
ahead in the division leading the GTX
680 by 9% margin it was neck-and-neck in
the new Tomb Raider game with both GPUs
delivering the same 39 FPS that said the
7970 was 3% faster when comparing the
minimum frame rate last but certainly
not least is the Witcher 3 Wild Hunt
unsurprisingly the GTX 680 takes the win
here
it was 8% faster when comparing the
average frame rates some of you might
have noticed how poorly the GTX 680
performed in some of the modern titles
when compared to the 7970 the 1440p
resolution in games such as Far Cry
primal Just Cause 3 the division and
rise of the Tomb Raider although I
didn't discuss the 1440p results as
these cards are better suited for 1080p
gaming I believe there's a simple
explanation for this and it has nothing
to do with display drivers instead I
think this rapid decline in performance
is likely down to the limit of VRAM
buffer of the 680 by default the 680 was
paired with only a 2 gigabyte vram
buffer while the 7970 was afforded a
little more breathing room here with his
3 gigabyte buffer compounding this issue
is the 256-bit wide memory bus which
limited the 680 to 192 gigabytes per
second whereas the 79 70s 384 bit bias
enabled bandwidth of 264 gigabytes per
second
it's almost 40% increase in bandwidth
means the 7970 can chew through its
buffered data faster now that we have
all the numbers let's find out what the
overall results are looking to the old
games we find that both cards delivered
virtually the same performance on
average the geforce gtx 680 averaged 69
FPS making it just 1% slower than the
radeon HD 7970 which averaged 70 FPS for
those wondering the minimums were much
the same though the GTX 680 did come out
on top here by a single frame 45 FPS
verses 44 fps jumping to the new games
we'd find similar results though this
time the GTX 680 was 5 and a half
percent slower than the 7970 51 FPS
versus 54 fps meanwhile the minimum
frame rates averaged out to be the same
at 40 FPS each so the margins are far
from significant despite growing 5 times
larger in favor of the 79 70 for the
newer games looking back to the older
games the GTX 680 was slower in 5 of the
9 tested for the new games that were
slower in seven of the nine games tested
so take away from that what you will
with the margins being as close as they
are it's hard to draw a solid conclusion
I'm not sure I'd be willing to claim the
AMD GPUs do in fact age better the small
percentage change that we are seeing
here can very well be down to the fact
that for the most part AMD has been able
to get away with very minor changes in
design since debuting the gcn 1.0
architecture back in 2012
not just that but today the current
generation r7 370 series still uses the
original GCM 1.0 architecture so you
have to imagine AMD is still optimizing
for it and video on the other hand is
little incentive to keep optimizing for
Kepler and I'm sure the four-year-old
geforce gtx 680 is no longer on the
driver teams radar unless something goes
horribly wrong this doesn't do anyone
who invested a thousand dollars in the
geforce gtx titan two years ago any
favors but I'm sure anyone with that
much money to throw around has since
moved on or plans to shortly once these
next-gen cards land and we said all that
we see no real evidence that in videos
older GPUs have slid significantly when
compared to the AMD counterparts so this
all seems like a bit of a non-issue
