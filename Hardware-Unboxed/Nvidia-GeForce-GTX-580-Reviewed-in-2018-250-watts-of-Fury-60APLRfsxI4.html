video we're turning the clock back way
back to a time when GPUs were built
using a 40 nanometer process and
featured gddr5 memory just 1.5 gigabytes
of gddr5 memory yeah anyway we're
jumping back to 2010 to revisit the
once-mighty GeForce GTX 580 now this
isn't going to be a quick blast from the
past type video where I compare the GTX
580 to some modern GPUs and a few games
laughs but it's outdated design and then
poke you in the eye before fading out to
20 seconds of cool barrel I'll still do
those last two things but before we do I
want to touch on some history show some
benchmark graphs of course and then play
a heap of games so strap yourselves in
as we go for a gentle stroll down memory
lane the GTX 580 is a venture began on
November 9th 2010 that was the first of
the GeForce 500 series to be released
and for a good reason
early that year in march and video
released their fermi microarchitecture
with the gtx 470 and 480 GPUs codenamed
GF 100 this marked a transition from 55
nanometers down to 40 nanometers for
Nvidia's high-end complex GPUs they did
start playing around the 40 nanometer
process back in late 2009 with the
entry-level price such as the geforce g2
220 230 and 240 for example then four
months later the mighty GTX 480 arrived
in gamers got their chance to buy a $500
u.s. graphics card that doubled as a
George Foreman grill with a TDP of 240
watts the GTX 480 didn't raise too many
eyebrows AMD's much smaller Radeon HD
5870 for example that was rated for 228
watts while their Joule GPU monster the
5970 smoked most power supplies with its
294 watt rating although both the Radeon
58 70 and GeForce GTX 480 were built
upon the same 40 nanometer manufacturing
process the 480 was massive the DOE is
over 50% larger Nvidia was striving to
create a GPU that packed both strong
gaming and strong computer
and that resulted in the GF 100-day
measuring and insane 529 millimeters
squared this behemoth of a die caused
problems 40 SMC's 40 nanometer process
which was still maturing at the time and
this resulted in poor yields and leaky
transistors for gamers the GTX 480 was
simply too hot to handle
literally you couldn't touch it even
after 10 minutes of shutting the PC down
that thing was still searing hot and
this also meant that it made more noise
than an old vacuum cleaner the fermi
based GF 100 architecture went down as
one of Nvidia's worst creations in
history and even at the time they knew
it was a real stinker so they quickly
got back to work and later that same
year they did relaunch Fermi with the
GTX 580 by November tsmc had ironed out
the kinks for their 40 nanometer process
and we got 7% more cos in a slightly
smaller die of course it wasn't just
tsmc that had time to work things out
and video 2 went back to the drawing
board and fixed what was wrong with the
GF 100 is on when they created the new
GF 110 otherwise known as the Fermi
refresh based on my own testing done in
2010 I noted that power consumption was
reduced by at least 5 percent and the
low temperatures for the reference
design card was 15 percent lower making
those results even more impressive was
the fact that across the dozen or so
games tested the 580 was on average 25
percent faster than the 480 that's a
significant performance uplift within
the same year particularly given that
they are both produced on the same
manufacturing process and the 580 as I
said also saved power so yeah it wasn't
really until the 580 came along that we
realised just how much the 480 sucked I
didn't like the 480 when it was first
released but yeah really wasn't until
the 580 came along eight months later
that I understood just how rubbish it
really was I concluded my 580 coverage
by saying the following the GeForce GTX
580 is unquestionably the fastest single
GPU graphics card available today
representing a better value than any
other high-end video card however it's
not the only option for those looking to
spend $500 dual Radeon HD 6870 s remain
very attractive it's just under $500
deliver more performance than a single
GeForce GTX 580 in most titles
however multi GPU technology isn't
without its pitfalls and given the
choice we will always opt for a single
high-end graphics card in videos GeForce
GTX 580 may be the current king of the
hill but this could all change next
month when AMD launches their new Radeon
HD 6900 series aimed II was originally
expected to deliver its came an XT and
Pro based Radeon HD 6970 and 6950
graphics cards sometime during November
but they have postponed their arrival
until mid-december for undisclosed
reasons if you don't mind holding off a
few weeks the weight could be worth some
savings or potentially more performance
for the same dollars depending on what
AMD has reserved for us now for those of
you wondering the Radeon HD 6970 was a
bit of a disappointment it fell short of
the GTX 518 as a result was priced to
compete with the GTX 570 this allowed
him video to hold the performance crown
without dispute for the next few years
it could be interesting to see how those
two stack up today perhaps that's
something we can look into in a future
video so we've established that the
GeForce GTX 580 was able to save face
from video in 2010 and retain the
performance crown for a few more years
before the 28 nanometer process arrived
in 2012 reigniting the GPU wore once
more what I want to know is how the
tubby 520 millimeters squared die gets
on today can the GTX 580 nits 512 CUDA
cores locked at 772 megahertz handle
today's games sure it does have gddr5
memory on a rather wide 384 bit wide bus
pumping out an impressive 192 gigabytes
per second but there's only one point 5
gigabytes of it at least for most models
there were three gigabyte variants
floating around but most people picked
up the original 1.5 gigabyte version
because that made the most sense at the
time to see how it handles I'm going to
compare it with the Radeon HD 7950 along
with the more recently released geforce
gtx 1050 1050 Ti and Radeon rx 560
so let's check out those results before
taking a gander at some actual gameplay
first up we have the battlefield 1
results using the ultra quality preset
which
as it turns out is a rather bad choice
for the GTX 580 and its measly 1.5
gigabyte frame buffer
don't worry though after we go over all
the graphs I will show you some gameplay
using some more agreeable settings for
now though we can see that here for 580
simply isn't cutting it and fails to
deliver what I would call playable
performance as a result it was a little
over 30% slower than the Radeon HD 7950
next up we have the dawn of war 3
results and this game was tested using
the more appropriate medium quality
preset here we see a reasonable 41 FPS
on average began the GTX 580 is haunted
by that limited vram buffer as the
minimum frame rate dropped down to just
23 fps and this meant that stuttering
was a bit of an issue dirt 4 was also
tested using the medium quality settings
and here the experience was quite good
with the GTX 580 certainly playable and
for the most part was very smooth at
1080p moving on we offer honor and here
we found a mostly playable experience if
that makes sense
at times we did drop down below 30 fps
and this did make the gameplay
noticeably more choppy than it was say
on the RX 560 or HD 7950 it's also
interesting to note that the GTX 1050
absolutely obliterates 2010 s flagship
part Ghost Recon wildlands isn't the
most optimized game to be released in
2017 that's for sure putting it mildly
let's say here the GTX 580 really
struggled to provide playable
performance using the lowest possible
quality settings at 1080p and there were
a number of graphical glitches as well
like dirt 4 we see decent results when
testing with Mass Effect Andromeda here
the GTX 580 Mansion average of 49 FPS at
1080p using the medium quality preset
the minimum or one percent low result of
44 FPS also meant that the gameplay was
quite smooth performance in prey wasn't
bad either though the texture quality
was horrible as most of the textures
simply didn't load so there was lots of
blurry looking surfaces the minimum
frame rate suffered a little bit because
of this but overall the gameplay itself
wasn't that bad it just looked quite
poor visually the average in Resident
Evil 7 was also quite good using the
medium quality settings they'll again
that limited frame buffer does kill
performance at times and we did see dips
down to 45 FPS which you know
is a playable frame rate we understand
but dropping from such a high average to
that kind of low point does cause
noticeable stuttering finally one test
where the GeForce GTX 580 wins hands
down is power consumption impressive
stuff unfortunately for the old Fermi
GPU lower is of course better here so
while impressive its impressively bad by
today's standards the GTX 1050 for
example was often seen delivering over
30% more frames and here we see it did
that while consuming over 50% less power
or at least allowing the system to
consume 50% less power
ok so the performance seen in a number
of those games wasn't particularly great
now the quality settings though they
weren't tuned to suit the GTX 580 those
are simply the settings that we used
previously to test modern low-end GPUs
that have larger vram buffers and those
results were recorded on our core i7 77
ok test system clocked at 4.9 gigahertz
though the CPU used isn't really a big
deal as none of the GPUs are limited by
our modern quad-core processor that said
though since I will be using more
appropriate quality settings in the
gameplay footage that you're about to
see I've also downgraded to the core i3
8100 using ddr4 2,400 memory albeit 610
gigabytes of ddr4 memory right so I
think that's pretty much everything
let's move on to see what the GTX 580
can do in a few more modern games here's
a look at our battlefield 1 runs using
the medium quality preset at Tim ep
after about 5 minutes of gameplay we saw
an average of around 60 FPS though there
were occasional dips down to 45 FPS as
you'd expect the 1.5 gigabyte via Ram
buffer was maxed out for the entire time
and as a result we were eating into
quite a bit of system memory but overall
the results weren't too bad with a
mechanical hard drive they frame dips
and stuttering will likely be much worse
so please note for testing that we were
using the crucial MX 500s SD still
overall the game looked good and played
surprisingly well now we have some Call
of Duty World War 2 results and here the
game had to be turned down to the normal
quality settings and this allowed for
reasonably good performance
the average framerate attorney peace
in the mid 70s while we never dip below
60 FPS so again that's not bad and
certainly very playable please note the
VRAM usage is not displayed in quite a
few of these tests I assume this is some
kind of glitch with the GTX 580 and
rivatuner
Assassin's Creed origins had to be
dialed down to the very low preset and
here we see a number of graphical
anomalies frame rates were also terrible
at turn DP here we saw just 24 FPS on
average with dips down to 18 fps I mean
it is technically playable but by my
standards I'm sure many of you yeah it's
it's not playable don't fall still looks
nice with the media and quality preset
and it played superbly never dropping
below 60 fps and like Call of Duty World
War 2 frame rates often hovered above 70
FPS very armed usage is quite low in
this game though again remember JUnit
isn't displaying that information
unfortunately towards the end of my test
I swapped to the high quality preset
which did improve visuals quite
noticeably but as you'd expect it also
reduced frame rates quite a participa
that's at an average of 53 FPS with dips
down to 48 fps was still very playable
f1 2017 also ran quite nicely at ADP
using the medium quality preset here the
GTX 580 averaged 56 FPS and only dropped
down to 46 fps salt was very playable
and actually very enjoyable fortnight
was also playable using the medium
quality settings I saw an average of
almost 70 FPS with dips down to 53 fps
of course this is a particularly
demanding game and VRAM usage only
peaked just over 1.1 gigabytes so the
RAM usage was quite low hell-blade
played reasonably well here the GTX 580
almost averaged 60fps after a
five-minute test and only dropped down
to 51 FPS so again very playable under
these conditions
Mass Effect and Roman are played
reasonably well with the medium quality
preset enabled in my test run saw an
average of 55 FPS with a minimum of 45
fps overwatch is the kinda game that
really runs well on pretty much anything
and this meant I was able to use the
high quality settings and still enjoy
over 60 FPS at all times at 1080p my 10
minute long tests are an average of 85
FPS for what was a smooth and
experience pray is actually a very well
optimized title but it does love to you
is plenty of vram and this has caused
some issues for the GTX 580 in the graph
seen previously we did see a 1% lower
result of just 39 fps and here we see a
42 FPS minimum which is a reasonable
drop from the 56 fps seen on average
still the game was playable and to be
honest the frame rates aren't really the
issue here rather it was the lack of
textures that spoiled the experience and
that is of course due to the fact that
we can't fit the textures in that 1.5
gigabyte v round buffer of course I have
tested with pub G and my test for this
one ran for 10 minutes and in that time
we saw almost 70 FPS on average with
dips as low as 44 fps overall though the
experience was certainly playable but I
was forced down to the lowest possible
quality things to achieve that
performance finally for testing World of
Tanks I used the built-in benchmark
using the medium quality option which
renders at 1080p here the GTX 580
averaged 142 fps by the end of the test
and never dip below 82 fps so very
playable performance in this title well
there you have it eight years later the
GeForce GTX 580 can still kind of almost
play all the latest titles in fact the
only real exception he was Assassin's
Creed origins I was able to achieve
smooth gameplay in pretty much every
other title that we tested using you
know low to medium type quality settings
so for bargain shoppers is the GTX 580
worth buying well right now you can
expect to pay anywhere from 30 to $60 us
and it's a similar story here in
Australia I've got one for $40 but they
have been selling for as little as $30
ozzie considering the performance you
get out of this card that actually seems
pretty good for a 580 not a particularly
bad option there that said for it to
really make any kind of sense you do
need to get it for about $30 and this is
really because the GTX 680 s can be
quite regularly had for $70 u.s. and
well that's just a much better product
the big issue for the GTX 580 other than
the very limited one and a half gigabyte
frame buffer is of course the power
consumption
it doubled the consumption of our core
i3 8,100 system where you can figure
with the gtx 1050 and as we noted it was
quite often up to over 30% slower so for
that factor alone I'd avoid the GTX 580
and look for something a little more
fuel-efficient on that note I'm gonna
wrap up this rather long video I assume
it's been quite long I hope you enjoyed
the revisit of the GTX 580 if you did
help us out and hit the like button I'm
your host Steve I'll catch you again
