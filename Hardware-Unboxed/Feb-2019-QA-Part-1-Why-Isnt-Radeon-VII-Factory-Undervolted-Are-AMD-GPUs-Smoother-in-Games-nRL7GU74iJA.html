I'm at Tim's wonderful set so must be
Q&amp;amp;A time Tim says we have a lot of
questions lined up so that waste any
more time let's go get into them okay
first question here from a discord
member it's mister boland again
I noticed that in your Resident Evil 2
optimization guide you notice that none
of the AI options were particularly good
this is for Tim so why is it that in
some games settings such as SM ma look
great and in others they can make the
game look terrible so tell us Tim yeah
well I can't say I'm a game development
expert so I guess this is just based on
what I've seen across a number of games
it's the main culprit for AAA techniques
looking bad seems to be taa or temporal
anti-aliasing and that just seems to be
a range of ways that different
developers implement that technique into
their game so for a game like Resident
Evil 2 their implementation is pretty
soft pretty blurry does a lot of
smoothing so obviously that's the style
that they wanted and liked in their
games so that's what they chose to
implement a game like battlefield 5 or
shadowing the Tomb Raider they also use
ta Abe it's a little bit different
there's obviously different parameters
you can tweak with each of these
anti-aliasing techniques so in those
games it looks a lot sharper and
obviously they've put a bit more time
into developing those techniques
that's for SMA that's a little bit
different in the way that it you know
tries to sharpen and preserve detail
compared to anti-air things you want
both of those techniques preserve and
yeah it just depends in some games
there's a lot of sort of shimmering
effects you can get with the way they
implement you know alpha effects and
that sort of thing the different
textures that can all sort of trigger
the sort of shimmering that you might
get in a game like Resident Evil 2 with
SMA so it just depends on the assets
that they're using across the game with
those techniques as to whether you know
SMA looks good or whether it looks bad
so yeah it's a real game by game basis
as to what is the best anti-aliasing
technique for a given game I think it's
safe to say that if you can super sample
again that's still still the best
technique that we've got okay good
question for you
here's Steve from our discord chat can
you explain in further detail the
difference between allocated memory and
memory usage as it related to V RAM
probably about the six gigabyte thing
yeah I come to this briefly I probably
can't go into it really in to much more
detail here for the Q&amp;amp;A would have to
research all the correct terminology and
everything is going on but in short
allocation is what the game well it is
aware of the resources it has available
and then it will allocate according to
what it thinks it needs and the
advantage of allocating more than what
it's currently using or exactly what it
needs is that ensures that those
resources will be available if need be
so you don't run into things like
stuttering and whatnot and then usage
which we can't actually measure at all
there's no possible way with the tools
that we have available or any of the
other tech media to measure current
exact memory usage so we have to sort of
do that it's guesswork but if there's
any missing or blurred textures if
there's stuttering on a six gigabyte
card a post on a gigabyte card so we can
really only measure allocation that's
where a huge amount of confusion comes
in because a new game will come out like
a and certain games will allocate
everything like the Call of Duty series
does that with most settings and then
some games are quite conservative with
what they allocate they seem to allocate
pretty close to what the usage will
actually be but when a new game comes
out and it allocates loads and loads of
memory people think that's justification
for needing a gigabytes 10 gigabytes or
whatever it may happen to be but as I
found in my recent explosion video
looking at the six gigabyte vram buffer
and then comparing that to I think it
was an acre you buy it for your own
buffer at the moment especially for
1440p with you know you your HD texture
packs and things like that 60 gigabytes
does seem to be perfectly fine but when
that will change I don't know it
probably might be too far into the
future but you hinted at that's probably
going to relate to console memory
buffers and things like that yeah if all
we see it mainstream usage push over 6
gigabytes yeah I can't get into too much
detail on that one I would have to do a
lot of research to bring you an actor
a Content piece on that but hopefully
that helps anyway okay on the subject of
VRAM another question here basically
asking in terms of VRAM requirements
it's a bit of a chicken and egg
situation so do the GPU manufacturers
increase the vram first and then the
game start using more vrm or is it the
game sort of push the manufacturers the
developers of the game push them to add
more very ram to the cards it's kind of
like a natural progression of things
that probably depends on a whole host of
things like how much memory costs to add
like does it make sense to do a doubling
of memory so that's probably one thing
but obviously the hardware has to be
there for the game developers to use
that much memory there's no point making
a texture pack that nobody can run it
more than one frame per second yeah I
think you know hardware manufacturers
would look at the trends and sort of see
where games are going you know if
they're making eight gigabyte cards and
current games using seven gigabytes out
of the eight gigabytes then there would
be that incentive to maybe bump it up to
twelve for the next generation yeah so I
think yeah it's kind of both yeah pretty
much yeah it's definitely both alright
another question from our discord chat
here the Vegas 64 I had was improved
greatly by under vaulting it used less
power and therefore ran cooler it sounds
like under vaulting on Radeon 7 still
produces good results so the problem has
not been fixed anybody know that under
vaulting is the valid tweaking option as
they provide the under vaulting options
in their general drivers so the question
is why aren't the cards tuned to these
lower voltages that put money into
cooling solutions to do with the higher
voltages and hate there must be a reason
for this it's very confusing oh yeah
that well there is a reason the reason
is that they have evaluated what
specifications the cards can run at at
what voltages so they'll have a
frequency range though a frequency they
want to achieve in a range they want the
card to run in and then what voltage is
required for you know a wider matter or
a good amount of the cards to work with
so it just improves yields so basically
if they want to make
the voltage tolerance is really low like
or really tight rather then the yields
will be a lot worse because they'll only
be but there'll be a much smaller
percentage of the silicon that we'll be
able to achieve that and so as an
example like Vega 64 you gave I had a
Vega 64 card that under volted amazingly
well like as best as the best sort of
result you can expect to get out of
those cards and I have one that was
terrible you undervolt it just ever so
slightly and just started crashing so
that's why Radeon seven can be under
vaulted it's a form of overclocking
really so you can under voltage I have
no idea what the percentage is but it
would be a reasonably large percentage
of them would have stability issues so
it's not yeah it's frustrating that I
suppose some cards do undeveloped really
well and look great but AMD would have
to have a much tighter bidding process I
suppose so they'd have to be a card that
runs a lot of frequencies or something
like that yeah it's the same with
overclocking of people wonder you know a
lot of manufacturers reach their factory
overclocked cards why is the reference
model just the same as in fact you've
got pretty much the same reason yep you
can only do so much with the silicon in
terms of yield so they need to keep the
taunts is nice and large yeah because
people think it's an under type thing
it's not like overclock yeah but it's
very much the same thing you're running
the card out of spec so yeah it's that
simple
okay mitch has a question here do you
think the gtx 1660 TI and then I suppose
that suppose a possibly being released
1660 and 1650 as in videos attempt at
upstaging Navi I think really they just
did it because they need to get more
competitive at those price points and
they wanted to do it with churring they
obviously didn't want to keep doing it
with older Pascal GPUs so that's really
why they did it they start to compete
with themselves so the GTX 1060 wasn't
selling great so it was time to move on
and obviously they do have to update
those product lines because at some
point AMD will come to the party with
newer more
efficient better products so yeah any
other thoughts on that one no I think
you personalize that one pretty well
move on okay when it comes to frame time
or VR which we don't test you beyond
over yourself we can only talk about the
frame time stuff then how do you guys
find the GTX or the Pascal ensuring
cards and then Vega and the Radeon seven
owners of AMD GPUs save the gameplay
seemed smoother on there HBM memory
cards versus nvidia cards any personal
experience or thoughts with that one
well we probably can talk to that a bit
because I I personally game with a Vega
56 card reason for that is I had a spare
one so I don't want to be taking the GPU
out of my personal system so I usually
just use whatever spare no matter how
low end or high and that may be in this
case it was very 56 I had two of those
so I'm using that and really I don't buy
until it all like there's some games
where the Radeon GPUs the frame time
performance isn't that good there's
other games where the Turing GPUs aren't
very good but for the most part they're
both very good in all games so yeah I
think that this whole frame time thing
came from way back when ami GPUs had a
lot of issues with crossfire frame
pacing I had issues with single cards
but and there made a killer crossfire
yeah and then they spent a long lot of
time improving that performance so then
I maybe throw time people thought that
it was was better than nvidia cards but
certainly as you said what i've
experienced myself as well there's
really no significant difference it can
vary title to title but overall I think
both cards yeah pretty much as smooth as
one another a couple of people are
complained with the Radeon 7 content
saying that I use the average frame
rates for showing the percentage
differences between cards and for
working out the cost per frame truth is
if you take the average one percent low
result across all the games you end up
with the same figures so yeah there'll
be some games where yeah the AMD GPUs
might be a teeny tiny bit smoother if
you're very sensitive to that and then
vice versa with the GeForce GPUs this is
an interesting question from science
gaming our disco
community what do you guys expect games
to look like in five years it's often
tough to tell with 100% certainty which
game is 2013 to 2014 in which game is
2018 to 2019 I think back in the day
everyone without hesitation could tell
which game is from 1997 and which is
from 2002 yeah I mean like with a lot of
things there's going to be diminishing
returns over a certain point you know
when you get really good quality
textures really good quality geometry
really good coiling you know there's
fewer and fewer things you can improve
in a game to get better you know visual
quality or differences between each
generation personally I probably could
tell the difference between 2013 games
and 2019 like if you look back on a game
from five years ago now this and they
telltale signs like high quality
lighting I think for the most part yes
there is but there are some games that
have been rehashed one or two or three
times too many
yeah it's asin's create or yeah I mean
well even like we saw it just calls for
like a lot of the effects went massively
backwards
yeah previous instalment so that was
disappointing to say I think just me
touching on this question quickly I
think back then hardware computer
hardware graphics cards were moving so
quickly whereas now that's as we've seen
since what 22 nanometer or something
that the new significant gains
especially from the mid-range the
mainstream uses it's coming much slower
so you are seeing that sort of five
years of gradual very slight tweaks to
the graphics yeah I mean the main
question here was you know what do you
guys expect games to look like in five
years I think there's probably a number
of categories that could be improved in
games I think there's some areas that
probably wouldn't be as improved as much
but certainly the one that I would look
at is lighting not quality because I
think the quality is very good at the
moment but certainly accuracy there
seems to be a move towards ray tracing
for example in five years time that
could be quite a dominant technology yes
that's one thing I look at I still think
today while texture quality is I was
going to say texture quality is high in
some games but it's not great in others
and I think as GPUs have more memory
available to them
on the consoles if the consoles
increased from 80 to say twelve or
sixteen in the next-gen will start to
see for 4k gaming really high quality
textures and then as well I think a big
area that I'd like to see approved is
sort of that not necessarily the
geometry of individual items but
certainly the number of items so the
ability to have your scene feel really
you know complete like in real life when
you go into someone's house is so me I
am sure I think that was a cool thing
about Metro Exodus yeah there's my I
haven't played a whole lot of it but the
bid I play yeah that was a high density
of just things objects entail so that
really made the game look pretty amazing
for me yeah so I think those are the
sort of three things I think I'd like to
see improved as well as sort of the on
the CPU side we might get better AI
better simulations and that sort of
thing but I certainly expect those three
hours I think
I think things more like water quality
for example still very good right now in
cloth simulations we've already got
techniques to simulate hair I think a
lot of those things I wouldn't expect
too many improvements on but the other
areas I would say there's still room to
grow there all right generally speaking
what monitor panel type T and IPS of EI
do you think provides the best balance
between response time and color vibrancy
so clearly your video on this topic was
not enough for Daniel so this is just
when I seen planets and that's fine
that's fine
so the best balance between response and
color vibrancy that's probably going to
be IPS V is the slowest in terms of
response times T and the fastest so I
think you know if you want the best
balance you probably have to go IPs
there's also a good option that said
Monte ends as well they're getting some
good quality you know tan panels we've I
reviewed that via check Mario recently
that good vibrancy so yeah I think you
know if you're looking at that 4 to 5
millisecond range for response times and
you want good colors then you probably
have to go IPs all right next question
do you consider a rise in 5 2600 a
bottleneck for an RT X 2080 or any
enthusiasts upscale PC builds so
basically any sort of high-end graphics
card where you sort of get these
questions every now and then it really
depends on the
games you're playing so we're looking at
what are we talking about there that's
ten atti sort of levels of performance
that's pretty punchy GPU performance
most games are GPU bound so shut off the
Tomb Raider for example especially if
you're running it you go for K forty or
forty P even I don't think it's going to
be as it's definitely look at me a
severe bottleneck horizon five twenty
six hundred is a great gaming processor
but it is very affordable
so the r-tx twenty eight is inexpensive
graphics card I suppose but you're using
a risin seven process aren't you I'm
using thread Rupa threat okay I thought
you thought you were gaming on a Rison
processor for a while I was yeah with a
with we thought nad with a nature but I
was playing at ultra wide 1440p yeah so
again very GPU bound there basically the
answer's no where the rise in process is
going to struggle is where is areas
where it would struggle with any GPU so
for example for player for V for
Starcraft 2 the rise in CPUs are
horrible it's an old game single maybe
maybe using two threads now thing it's
still single thread and it just doesn't
take advantage of any of the rise and
instructions or anything like that so
it's it runs very badly there's a couple
of other old games that people have told
me run badly but any new modern
demanding totally like your battlefield
5 that'll run perfectly fine multiplayer
and all that so no I don't think it's
really something you have to concern
yourself with I think for the most part
we perfectly fine alright we've got a
big combo question here from one of our
YouTube commenters Grady on the question
yes for question we're gonna have to
rapid-fire these I reckon so
are you really steep I'll try let's go
do you think our TX and ELSS will be
adopted by gamers not right now yeah I
mean it's got to be adopted by game
developers before gamers can adopt it
yep
do you think games I should be excited
for rise in 3000 CP so should you be
excited for the rights in 3000 yeah why
the hell not yep do you think the RAM
prices will go down in 2019 quarter to
or quarter three I already had started
to go down significantly yeah they're
definitely dropping so yeah I don't
think they drop
much more significantly they'll probably
tend to do that before ddr5 comes then
they'll sort of do I'll probably pick up
a little bit as production slows stops
and a final one here do you think that
Navi will compete with r-tx graphics
cards I mean sure you will compete with
one of them at least you would hope so
yeah yeah hard to say though yeah okay a
good question here from one of our
YouTube commenters in the used market I
see a lot of people selling their old
Intel CPUs for a lot of money the i7
4790k is still selling about 200 euros
on average while the Rison 520 600 news
only 170 euros why do people think that
old CPUs are worth so much well because
they are like if they're selling them
for that much well if they're listing
them for that much and they're selling
for that much they're worth that much
but there's multiple reasons for why
that is one of them is people buy or
have an older Intel system with that
platform and maybe they bought it with a
core i3 or a Pentium whatever they want
to upgrade and it's much cheaper for
them to spend $200 or 200 euros on 4790k
than it is to build a whole new rise and
or you know modern Intel systems that's
why they do that so that's generally why
you can ask so much for those CPUs
because it's just it is still cheaper
for someone another reason which is
going to be unpopular opinion but it is
true the i7 4790k for most games
particularly older games we had a
question where I mentioned Starcraft
earlier the Intel processor is still
going to perform better than horizon 5
2600 and a lot of people use that
information to bag the rise and 5
processor and say how garbage rising is
because older Intel CPUs like this has
well based core i7 that we're talking
about is faster for gaming but from
Haswell all the way up to coffee lake
which the increases in IPC have been
very very small the increases in
frequency have also been very very small
so it's not an old ancient rubbish CPU
architecture from Intel Haswell still
very good until as it made many steps
since then it's still a quad core
with eight threads so it still plays all
the latest games is that a problem and
like I said it's faster than most of the
rise and lineup but the reason why I
recommend you buy a rise in five 2600 if
you're looking at if you're not if you
don't have an old Intel see system and
you're looking at building a new
computer you like for similar money I
can get a used Intel system or do I buy
a risin system I highly recommend you
don't bother with the use stuff all the
obvious pitfalls that come with buying
used hardware and the rise in five 2600
is plenty fast as we said we'll get the
most out of just about every GPU you can
afford it
if you're looking at buying second out
hardware and it has all modern platform
features so there's it's got native USB
3.1 and all that kind of stuff new
hardware warranty and you'll be able to
upgrade to the Rison 3000 series later
in the area so it's got a good upgrade
path it's not a dead platform you've got
room to upgrade without having to try
and buy higher end processors for
exorbitant exorbitant prices so or
exuberant prices rather sorry about that
okay that concludes part 1 of this
month's QA good job picking the
questions and good job asking the
questions very good questions this month
it was a lot of fun and I'm keen to go
getting apart Steve it's your phone for
the Q&amp;amp;A videos mate what are you doing
you can go long like subscribe share
follow us on patreon we're very
professional now we gotta use that come
on you can't you can't back out now out
of that row okay uh yeah so like
subscribe what else do we tell people to
do they can give us money on patreon
they can if you hadn't done that you
would have caught our livestream we just
did before this it was amazing can't
talk highly enough yeah
best livestream a fighter has occurred
you have to wait until next month's
livestream yeah you can't go back and
watch them no impossible anyway thank
you very much for watching thank you for
supporting us and I'm your host Steve
I'm your host Tim that's who this guy's
