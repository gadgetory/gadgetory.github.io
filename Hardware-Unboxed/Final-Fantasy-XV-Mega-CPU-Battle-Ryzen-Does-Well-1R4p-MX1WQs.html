we're checking out Final Fantasy 15 CPU
performance using the new standalone
benchmark which has been released ahead
of next month's PC launch
I asked if you guys wanted a benchmark
over the game with 30-plus GPUs of the
almost 5,000 people that voted 60% of
you were very keen on the idea that
being the case I decided to get on with
the benchmarking but before things
really got rolling I actually ended up
changing gears and decided to do CPU
testing first rather than the GPU
testing as it just looked a bit more
interesting I still do plan to conduct
extensive GPU benchmarks later in the
week though the reason I wanted to look
at CPU performance first is because the
game is extremely CPU intensive far more
so than I was expecting
developer square-enix recommends gamers
pack at least a core i7 3770 or an FX
8350 typically I'd say that's
significantly more firepower from Intel
but whatever we'll look into that
shortly the point here being the game
calls for 8 threaded CPUs for the
recommended specs while on the GPU front
they believe you'll get away with the
GTX 760 or an r9 280 oddly in that
comparison
AMD packs far more firepower but then
this is an Nvidia sponsored title which
game works baked in according to Nvidia
the game features integrated Nvidia flow
in video here works
Nvidia hybrid first and trace shadows
Nvidia turf effects and NVIDIA voxel
ambient occlusion as I understand these
game work features are only enabled with
the higher-quality presets although the
CPU testing has been carried out using a
GeForce GTX 1080i I've also tested with
these standard and light quality presets
as well the standalone benchmark runs
for over 5 minutes and covers several
events maps and characters used in the
game for our tests though we are
reporting frame rates across a 90 second
piece of that benchmark and all results
are based on an average of 3 runs the
test begins at the start of the car
journey then and shortly after everyone
gets out of the car to begin their
chicken ride as you do please note I
found the frame rates were often
negatively impacted when fading in and
out between scenes so I avoided
think across those as always any Auto
overclocking functions in the bias were
disabled and lock CPUs were paired with
the appropriate memory for example a
core i3 8100 was tested with ddr4 2400
memory the unlocked processors were
tested with ddr4 3200 memory and this
was also true for the AMD Rison cpus
again the geforce gtx 1080i was used for
all testing with the latest drivers so
let's get into the results starting
things off we have the higher quality
results at tally P and for those
wondering this is the maximum quality
preset which has all the game works
features enabled here the gtx 1080i
created a system bottleneck with an
average of 91 FPS so quite shocking to
see such a high end GPU limited to less
than 100 FPS at this relatively low
resolution first graph let's focus on
the average frame rates before sorting
the data by the frame time results here
we see the rise in processors all
perform very well in relation to the
Intel h√± CPUs though Intel is being
limited by the gtx 980ti here even the
much older core i7 2670 50 looked quite
good though the a12 9800 falls into a
heap here and really isn't able to
deliver playable performance sorting the
data from the 1% low frame time results
we see at the 87 RK is 23% fast and
horizon 7 1800 X and Rison 5 1600 X the
1800 X is roughly on par for Sandy
Bridge 26 under came quite shockingly
the FX 8350 that said we see reasonable
performance across the entire field with
the exception of the a12 9800 then if we
focus on the point one percent data the
older 2600 K and FX 8350 processors fall
away as do the more modern quad-core
processors such as the Rison 3 1300 X
and core i3 8100 though the higher
clocked a 350 K still does quite well
since we were so heavily limited at turn
DP with the gtx 1080i at least for the
high and eights gen core processors I
decided to try the 720p resolution here
the 87 arcade was now 11% fast in the
1800 X for the average frame rate though
the 1% load data was much the same
despite pulling away by an 18 percent
margin for the 0.1% low result okay so
there's the high quality results and the
most part things looked pretty good
there was the occasional frame study
here and there but that was smooth doubt
due to the three run
average so potentially a little bit
misleading there but I'll wait to get
into that till we actually have the game
unfortunately that frame stuttering I'm
talking of that we're seen even with a
core i7 87 okay and GTX tonight eti so
there's probably still some optimization
work to be done even on invidious behalf
that so though if we disable the game
works features using the standard
quality pros at least that's what I
believe we're doing and the performance
smoothed out quite considerably and we
saw a few other interesting things as
well so let's move on and take a look at
those results here are the standard
quality results at any p.m. right away
we are seeing more consistent
performance with perhaps the exception
of the older 2600 k in FX 8350
processors however looking at the 8700 K
in the 1800 X we now see a much smaller
difference in performance the 87 RK is
now just 12% fast when comparing the
0.1% results whereas previously it was
almost 30% faster the variation in the
average framerate and 1% lower result is
also file a significant in fact horizon
looks very impressive using the standard
quality settings as the rise in v 1400
delivers much more consistent
performance when compared to say the
core i3 8100 for example if we sort the
graph by the one percent lower results
we see just how close it is between the
top six processes which includes the
rise in seven 8200 X along with the
risin 5 1600 X and 1500 X meanwhile the
rise in three 1200 is comparable to the
core i3 83 50k and core i7 2680 350 also
does surprisingly well as it does manage
to get amongst that bunch now I thought
while I was at it why not invest the
time to check out the light quality
preset and this led to some very
interesting findings normally intel's
higher clock cpus run away with the low
resolution low-quality testing as they
provide much higher maximum frame rates
and we do see that here when looking at
the average frame rates the 8th gen core
i5 and core i7 processes we're able to
max out the gtx today to add a hundred
and seventy-one FPS on average making
them at least 11 percent faster than the
Rison 7 1800 X however you might have
noticed something strange when looking
at the frame time data so let's move on
to focus on that here we see something
very unexpected when sorting the data by
the one percent low result the Rison
cpus come out on top in fact even the
Rison 313 higher actors
beat the core i7 87 are okay that's not
the case for the 0.1% result but here
there isin five and rise in seven CPUs
still beat the mighty core i7 87 okay
this is very unusual I'll have to do a
bit more digging to work out what's
going on here well there was certainly
some interesting results there and it
should give you a good idea of the
processing power you'll require to play
Final Fantasy 15 next month assuming
nothing changes between now and when the
game is released next month I enough to
assume though that the benchmark tool is
very accurate given the developer has
released it ahead of time to allow
gamers to prepare their systems based on
my testing if you have a quad core
that's clock below 4 gigahertz you're
probably going to struggle with anything
more than the light quality settings the
game is extremely CPU intensive for
example the 12 threaded 87 ok rarely dip
below 40 percent utilization and in our
own has spent most of its time hovering
over 50% at times hitting as high as 80%
it was a similar story for the rise in
718 hundred so more time was spent
hovering around 30 to 40 percent still
the lower and rise and CPUs featuring 12
or less threads were very heavily
utilized I should note that these 1600 X
and 1800 X were 5 to 10% faster with SMT
disabled depending on the test but I
haven't shown any of those results and I
didn't go to in-depth the testing as I
doubt many of you are gonna disable SMT
just to gain a bit of extra performance
in Final Fantasy 15 but at least note
that if you wanted to you could the high
quality settings which we believe enable
all the game works features were a bit
concerning stuttering was certainly an
issue here even with the most extreme
hardware configurations so some
optimization work still needs to be done
on that note AMD says they aren't going
to release their optimized driver until
next month when the game is officially
released that said I'll likely still do
some preliminary GPU testing shortly
obviously I'm really keen to test the
game in a bit more depth once it is
fully released and hopefully we'll get a
great deal of settings that can be tuned
and tweaked for better results anyway
that's going to do it for this one I
hope you enjoyed the CPU performance
preview and stay tuned for more content
I'm your host Steve
