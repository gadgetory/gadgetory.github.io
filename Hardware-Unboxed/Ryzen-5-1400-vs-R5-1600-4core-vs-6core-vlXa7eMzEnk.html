it's been a few weeks since I created
any rising content on the channel
and I've got to admit I've been
exhibiting a few withdrawal symptoms so
the time has come when I must once again
make some kind of rise and related
benchmark video so this one we're simply
going to test the horizon 514 hundred
head to head with their Aizen five
sixteen hundred sounds pretty simple and
well it is my day one rise in 5 coverage
compared the 1500 X and 1600 X as these
are the only models to get my hands on
prior to release recently though I do
compare the 1500 X and 1400 and they're
out of the box form as well as a 4
gigahertz overclock at the time I noted
it would have been very cool to compare
the 1600 and 1400 head-to-head under the
same conditions so I'm finally doing
just that
next week I do plan to add the horizon 7
1700 to the mix once I get a little bit
more time anyway for this one we have
the horizon 5 1400 versus 1600 quad
versus hex 8 megabyte vs. 16 megabyte
level 3 cache 170 dollars versus 220
dollars before we get to that a quick
recap of what we've learnt so far when
it comes to the cheaper quad core rise
and 5 processes the 1400 and 1500 X are
very similar in terms of price the 1400
is just $20 cheaper that said though it
does have half as much level 3 cache on
offer
we found this can make quite a large
difference to performance even for
gaming however refused a mid-range
graphics card or really anything less
than a gtx 1080 then the cache capacity
makes a little to no difference so under
realistic conditions for these sub $200
CPUs the cache size doesn't make a big
difference
at least when gaming this then had me
leaning towards the more affordable
1,400 after all when it comes to budget
builds every dollar counts I also felt
that if you are going to spend the extra
$20 to get the 1500 X you might as well
spend another $30 to get the 6 core 1600
it's not really a big leap speaking of
the 1600 this is the golden ship of the
entire rise and range in my opinion the
1600 X is essentially the same ship
laksa cooler and cost 14% more so in my
opinion aim D can keep that one the r5
1600 though really is AMD's gift to
enthuse us particularly so for those
guys that stuck with them even through
the whole bulldozer debacle at $220 us
even a month after release I still can't
believe it costs just $220 us or $300
Australian anyway at that price at
Polk's find it until 6:00 core 6800 K
pokes the 7600 K in the eye and just
body slams the 9k model so me it strikes
the perfect balance of everything right
now for gaming six cores with SMT
support is perfect as much the same
we're looking application performance as
well quad cores are becoming a bit too
lean while octo cause are still overkill
for the most part that being said the
1600 does cost $50 us more than the 1400
but I was shocked to also find a $50
difference down under a straight
currency conversion should see the 1600
cost around $70 more in ozland
but that isn't the case 50 dollars
Australian really isn't a huge amount of
money for what we're talking about here
as many of you know I have been a
supporter of the horizon 5 1400 for the
simple fact that 170 dollars that
decimates the Intel competition wrecking
the core i3 70 350 K a dual core that
comes at the same price it also takes it
to the core i5 range often beating the
core i5 70 470 500 by handy merge and
anyway we'll discuss the value of the r5
1400 a bit more in a moment for now
let's jump to the benchmarks something
interesting to note is that previously I
wasn't able to run the 1400 with ddr4
3,200 memory this speed worked okay with
the 1600 X but not the 1600 or 1400 I
just assumed I was a bit unlucky here
with these chips and they featured
weaker memory controllers while having
recently updated my asrock X 317 Taichi
to the latest biased revision both the
1600 and 1400 now work perfectly with
the XMP 3200 setting the 1600 is also
hitting a memory bandwidth of almost
thirty eight gigabytes per second now
I'm yet to retest the Rison seven chips
that I will do so shortly moving on we
have the Cinebench r15 results here we
see with the 1,400 and 1,600 matched at
or gigahertz that the six core CPU is
55% faster not really a shocker though
as it does have 50% more cores and that
extra bit of performance likely comes
from the larger l3 cache out of the box
the 1600 was 65 percent faster thanks to
a clock speed advantage if like Tim you
love Microsoft Excel than the r5 1600 is
the chip for you clock for clock at 4
gigahertz it was more than twice as fast
as the 1400 a hundred and eight percent
faster in fact the 1400 is still
respectable on this test but if extreme
workloads are your game and the 1600 is
a must this will also be true for other
applications that can utilize all six
cores we find a similar story when
testing 7-zip here the 1600 was 50%
faster than the 1400 when comparing the
two at 4 gigahertz out of the box the
1600 was 61% faster so in terms of value
it's pretty amazing given early cost 30%
more here we have a doe Premiere Pro CC
and the r5 1400 does rather well in this
test completing the workload in just 301
seconds once overclocked to 4 gigahertz
this method 1600 was just 36% faster and
while that is really a significant
margin it's clearly not receiving the
full benefit of having the additional 2
cores in this application using Adobe
Premiere Pro CC to measure power
consumption we see that the 1400 still
consumes less than the 1600 even when
overclocked total system consumption was
increased by 19% though that said this
was a good result for the 1400 as it
provided 18% more performance in
premiere once overclocked the gains were
similar for the 1600 here it consumes
16% more power lines overclocked
which is fair given we saw a 13%
increase in performance with both the
1,400 and 1,600 overclocked to 4
gigahertz the beefier 6 cord ship push
system consumption 21 percent higher
please note for testing I've only used
the GTX 1080 Ti
but since we tested the 6 games I'm
about to show you with the RX 480 in the
previous Rison 5 video we know what the
limits of this GPU are for example the
RX 4 80 maxed out at 84 FPS on average
in battle through one at 1080p using the
same quality settings as a result of
1400 and 1500 X were GPU limited and
produce the same performance therefore
if you are running a 60
using the IR explore ad or rx5 ad
graphics cards the performance in this
title will be identical to that of the
1400 even the 1% in point 1 percent
performance will be very similar however
if we remove the GPU bottleneck or at
least reduce its impact on the results
by using the gtx 1080i the r5 1600 is
able to stretch its legs a little more
here we see the 4 gigahertz overclock
leading to 22% better performance for
the 1600 over the 1400 at the same
frequency out of the box the 1600 was
fast about even greater margin providing
29% more performance thanks to a clock
speed advantage so if you have a
higher-end GPU or play at lower quality
settings to achieve higher frame rates
then the 1600 will enable greater
performance in this title previously we
found the R X 480 limited performance in
mafia 3 251 SPS on average with a point
1 percent time of 40 FPS as you can see
the GTX 1080i pushes well past this but
it again means even with the R 5 1400
you can get the most out of a mid-range
graphics card here we see once both CPUs
are overclocked to 4 gigahertz the 1600
still delivers 18% more performance
reaching an average of 90 fps it was
also 33% faster when comparing the 0.1%
performance and 26% faster for the 1%
result after the singularity escalation
loves them cause so it's no surprise the
1600 pulls well ahead here clock for
clock for 1600 was 30% faster than the
1400 and that's obviously a significant
margin ashes the singularity is mostly a
CPU bound game so you will see similar
gains even with a mid-range GPU as a box
the 1600 average 99 FPS to the 1481 fps
making a 22% faster and hitman the
margin was slightly reduced once
overclocked the 1600 is now 19% faster
it's interesting to note even with the 4
gigahertz overclock on all cores the
1400 can't beat the stock 1600 and this
is something we've seen in every game
tested so far overclocking the 1400
boosted Deus Ex mankind divided
performance by 12% heading an average of
96 fps the same overclock only netted
the 1600 a further 3 percent performance
and it appears as though we are reaching
the limits of the 1080i he
this would certainly appear to be true
given the 77 okay is also limited to
around 110 fps under these same
conditions
anyway clock for clock at 4 gigahertz
despite the GPU bottleneck the 1600 was
still 16 percent faster than the 1400
wrapping up the benchmarks we have total
war Warhammer here the 1600 was 24%
faster than the 1400 with both CPUs
overclocked meanwhile the stock
frequencies at 1600 was 28% faster at
least when comparing the average frame
rate anyway alright so as usual the
results have given us a few things to
discuss firstly if application
performance is vital then the r5 1600
makes sense over the 1400 as we did see
strong gains in the few applications
tested it's quite clear though if the
program can utilize those extra two
cores and the gains offered by the 1600
will be quite substantial Premiere Pro
CC for example showed the weakest gains
of the applications tested and yet it
still offered a 36 percent performance
bump given the 1600 costs just 30% more
that makes it a better value option here
for gamers though it's a little less
clear which way you should go you can
save money by getting the 1400 or you
can spend a little bit more ensure
maximum performance with the 1600 again
the 1600 chip does cost 30% more but
really it's only a $50 difference and
that isn't a huge amount of money for
what you're getting if we look at the 1%
data which I feel is the more important
metric for comparing CPU gaming
performance actually this data is
virtually identical to the minimum
France the second result just slightly
lower but whatever let's not get into
that one here looking at the 1% results
we found that the 1600 was faster by a
23% margin in battlefield 1 17% for Deus
Ex 20% for hitman 26% for mafia 3 46%
for total war and 29% faster and ashes
of the singularity this means on average
to 1600 was 27% faster in the games
tested obviously the 1600 has a
significant advantage over the 1,400 and
CPU intensive games that use more than 4
cores that said if we were to test games
such as for honor Far Cry primal or the
division for example then you would
likely see a little to no difference
between the 1,400 and 1,600 processors
as these games are primarily GPU base
and using realistic quality settings
there will also be minimal difference
between the two when using a mid-range
GPU targeting higher to ultra quality
type settings still keeping all that in
mind it's clear there isin five 1600 has
more to offer gamers and as more
demanding titles become available it
will continue to outpace the 1400 in
then when all said and done it really
does just come down to $50 and when
comparing these processes side-by-side
that's a 30% cost increase however
looking at it more realistically it's
actually not nearly that much the
cheapest be 350 boards for example start
at $70 us and when factoring that into
the equation that means that 1600 is now
just 20% more expensive
throw in 16 gigabytes of ddr4 memory and
now the 1600 cost just 15% more you can
see where this is going
in the end once you factor in total
system cost $50 could account for just a
5 percent price increase so looking at
it that way the 1600 does seem like the
obvious choice still there really are a
heap of different ways you can look at
this and everyone's situation is a bit
different that said if you are building
a new system from the ground up
I suggest you cough up that extra cash
for the 1600 those extra 2 cores will
certainly come in handy now I'm keen to
throw the horizon 7 1700 into this
comparison probably next week and see if
it's worth spending the extra cash or do
reach a point of diminishing returns
with the 8 core processor
anyway that's going to do it for this
one hopefully this helps those of you
trying to decide between the four core
and 6 cores and 5 models I'm your host
Steve see you again soon guys
