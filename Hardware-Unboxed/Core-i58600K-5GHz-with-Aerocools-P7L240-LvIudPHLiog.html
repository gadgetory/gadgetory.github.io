we're doing a little bit of overclocking
with the core i5 8600 k it actually just
occurred to me that while i have
overclocked and fully tested the core i7
87 okay and even the core i3 83 50k i'm
get to overclock the core i5 8600 k
generally speaking the 87 or k is good
for around 5 gigahertz and with the 86
enrique you should be aiming for around
that figure as well before any
multipliers can be adjusted or voltages
can be cranked up we need a good cooler
traditionally I like to use all-in-one
liquid coolers and my go-to model for a
while now has been courses hydro Series
H 100 IV - it's a proven solution that
comes in at a reasonable $110 us or 140
dollar
ozzie asking price I am however always
on the lookout for something new
something different and if I'm lucky
something better earlier in the you
during the Computex trade show in Taiwan
I spotted something that was indeed very
new in fact so new it was upcoming at
the time on display over at the Aero
cool booth was the new p7 L 240
all-in-one liquid cooler as part of the
company's new project seven brand it was
advertised as being able to do it all
and by that I mean cool high-end cps
while also looking cool armed with a 240
millimeter radio that's 28 millimeters
thick a pump and reservoir package
that's serviceable and more lighting
than a Christmas tree this all-in-one
looks to have it all that said though it
would want to a0 cool are charging 130
dollars u.s. so around $20 us more than
the tried-and-true H 100 Ivy - that said
it is slightly cheaper than course as
flagship the H 115 I and when it comes
to bling the p7 L 240 wins hands down
but how well does it actually work to
find out I've overclocked my core i5
8600 K to 5 ug Hertz using 1.3 3 volts
on the gigabyte z 370 or a scamming 7
motherboard I should note though that my
6 core CPU hasn't been deleted so
overclocked to this frequency it boils
most budget liquid coolers with a how
much effort the H 100 Ivy to peaks at
around 80
reason the i-264 stress test which is
actually very respectable particularly
given how quiet that cooler is that said
though the massive knocked to our NHD 15
air cooler peaks at just 75 degrees
which is an exceptional result but there
are a few drawbacks to installing such a
large cooler the big one of course being
compatibility with other components so
the first step was to strap on the arrow
called p7 L 240 and see how well it
manages the overclocked 8600 k couldn't
avoid running into throttling issues at
5 gigahertz well let's go find out right
off the bat I fired up the Ida 64 stress
tests and started stressing just the cpu
after a short period the p7 L 240 peak
to just 61 degrees which is already true
degrees cooler than the H 100 IV to
after the same period of time I then
enabled the FPU stress test and left the
system running for an hour after which
point a maximum temperature of just 77
degrees was logged that's two degrees
hotter than the NHD 15 but five degrees
cooler than the H 100 IV - so an
impressive result indeed I should note
that for all the testing I maintain an
ambient room temperature of just 21
degrees next I tried a real-world
application of the gooseberry workload
in blender which takes the overclocked
8600 K about an hour to complete in that
time the p7 L 240 picked adjust 71
degrees which is considerably better
than the H 100 IV - which weren't as
high as 77 degrees the not so an air
cooler meanwhile maxed out at just 68
degrees so again it is the best
performer but that probably isn't
entirely unexpected
then finally give Cinebench r15 a shot
running the multi-core test three times
in concession and reporting the maximum
temperature for this test the p7 L 240
at 73 degrees while the H 100 IV - when
as high as 79 degrees
meanwhile the monstrous NHD 15 never
went above 70 degrees for those
wondering the multi-threaded score went
for around 1050 points at these stock
operating clock speeds - 1220 points
with all cores clocked at 5 gigahertz so
by keeping temperatures in check
performance in this test was boosted by
16% in terms of cooling performance the
Aero cool piece ever L 240
stop rattling he's on par with the best
sub $150 us all in one liquid coolers
that I've tested although it wasn't able
to match the nock to our NHD 15 air
cooler it's well worth noting the
Corsair crystal 570 X case used for
testing provided boatloads of airflow as
the front and top glass panels were
removed for the tests with three 120
millimeter front mounted intake fans the
NHD 15 was fed loads of cool air and the
hot air it dumped back in the case was
quickly extracted in a more confined
space or sat with less airflow the P 7 l
240 could potentially perform better as
almost all the heat generated by the CPU
is dumped directly outside the case in
addition to the strong performance there
are a number of other positive
attributes the all-important
installation process is very
straightforward and I really appreciate
the inclusion of double-sided tape for
sticking the mounting bracket to the
backside of the motherboard
this made the installation process
considerably easier the only hitch here
being that the back plate features
yellow tabs and for those that care
about aesthetics which I feel be most
people buying this kind of cooler this
could be a bit off-putting yellow tabs
aside though this flexible backplate
does allow the p7 L 240 to be installing
almost all current desktop platforms in
fact the only exception here is aimed
each thread ripper tr4 socket thankfully
though the am floor platform is
supported along with all current Intel
platforms including the LGA 2066 socket
other than the 240 millimeter radiator
which measured 275 millimeters in length
and a 121 millimeters wide
there's the block pump and reservoir
unit which stands 62 millimetres tall
and 95 millimeters at its widest this
does make it pretty large for an a io
but this is because we do have a
reasonably large 100ml reservoir here
which can be topped up with extra fluid
if need be rather than your more typical
or even square block housing air oh cool
went with a hexagon shape which looks
very unique and thanks to the clear
acrylic housing looks amazing when lit
up the two 120 millimeter fans on the
radiator also feature translucent blades
which are backlit for a cool effect this
all ties together very nicely when
connected to the arrow cool hub which
allows you to control everything via
software that said though the p7h
hub is sold separately and without it
you will require a motherboard that
offers an RGB header
the only downside to all this RGB
goodness are the cables there are four
cables in total coming from the fans and
two from the Warner blocks we totally
have half a dozen wires that you need to
deal with and that can be a bit of a
pain for the cable management department
I have to say I've been pleasantly
surprised with what the error call p7
240 has to offer
I was really just expecting a bit of a
light show from this thing and not much
substance when it came time to perform
but it's really proven that it's a
serious all-in-one liquid cooler and
it's more than just an RGB light show in
a nutshell I appreciate the easy
installation process the quiet operating
volume solid build quality a unique
appearance and of course the performance
the negative aspects of this product I
would say include the fact that the p7
h1 that's the RGB controller and fan
controller isn't included in the package
with an MSRP of 130 dollars us buying
that thing separately will be a costly
affair
the only other negative aspect I'd say
is probably the massive amount of cables
that hang off this thing to take
advantage of those RGB effects there are
plenty of cables as you can see here and
that while the installation process of
the block itself onto the CPU socket is
quite easy having to our deal with these
in a neat and tidy fashion is a bit
time-consuming I have to say overall
arrow calls p7 L 240 performs great and
well it looks great as well I highly
recommend it for anyone looking for an
all-in-one that will give their rig that
special look and of course if you plan
to overclock your core i5 8600 cater 5
gigahertz assuming the chip can do it
this cooler will keep the temps in check
and well that's going to do it for this
one I'm your host Steve see you again
next time
