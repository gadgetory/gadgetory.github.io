the menu for you today I have a product
review the product in question is
creative soundblaster X katana
multi-channel gaming sound bar now full
disclaimer this is not a budget offering
creative have designed this to be the
ultimate sound bar and they claim the
katana is a league of its own
delivering under monitor audio that's
unmatched by other so-called gaming
sound bars let me just say right off the
bat that their claims would want to hold
true as the katana cross a cool 310
dollars us and while it's yet to go on
sale down under I expect it to retail
for almost $500 Aussie that's more than
Logitech's flagship z9o 65.1 thx
surround system granted they are two
different products but still how razor's
Leviathan gaming sound bar costs just
$200 u.s. or surprisingly 220 ozzie
though admittedly it does look to be an
inferior product at least on paper
creative is certainly set the bar no pun
intended very high with their pricing so
what makes the katana worthy of such an
asking price right away you get the
impression this is an expensive product
the design looks and feels great and I
have to admit the sound bar itself is
much more compact than I was expecting
the bar measures just 600 millimeters
long 79 millimeters wide and 60
millimeters tall it also weighs are
relatively light 1.5 kilograms creative
says that the bar is powered and
enhanced by their award-winning
multi-core audio DSP making it the
world's first true under monitor audio
system so what we have here are four
speakers within the sound bar along with
a standalone subwoofer which we will get
to shortly situated on the top of the
sound bar either ender two 2.5 inch
upward firing mid bass drivers designed
to pump out clean transparent mid-range
dynamic mid bass creative believes by
directing the audio upwards this
provides a wider soundstage that doesn't
require the listener to be situated in
the audio sweet spot then we have to 1.3
inch high extrusion tweeters which face
forwards and are found at each end of
the sound bar
I don't believe creative gives
individual ratings per speaker but they
do say that the total package delivers
75 watt RMS or
50 watt peak power thanks to their try
amplified design with the tri amplified
design the amplifiers are controlled by
creatives multi called digital signal
processor or DSP there are two dedicated
driving the 2.5 inch mid speakers
another 2 dedicated to deliver the high
frequencies for those one point three
inch speakers and one dedicated to turn
out heart thumping bass for that
stand-alone subwoofer speaking of the
subwoofer this compact unit measures
just 333 millimeters tall 299
millimeters deep and 130 millimeters
wide it tips the scales that are
reasonable heavy four kilos especially
considering that it's not a self-powered
unit inside you will find a long through
five and a quarter inch driver featuring
super stiff paper cone and a low loss
surround finally driver is housed in an
MDF box with a flared port tube moving
on katana impressively also doubles as a
sound card when connected to a PC using
the micro USB interface in this mode it
also supports virtual 7.1 channel audio
to deliver a more realistic gaming
experience speaking of connectivity
around the back
tucked away is another USB port a type-a
port and this can be used to connect a
USB flash drive containing your favorite
songs to be played directly by the
katana sound bar there is also an
optical input along with an analogue
mark in and auxilary inputs as well as a
headset output jack of course the sound
bar is also crucially bluetooth
compliant and implements version 4.2
support up top we find five buttons two
of which feature LED backlit activity
lights the first of which is the power
slash bluetooth pairing button then we
have the volume down button volume up
and source button finally last button
which also features LED lighting is the
SPX button therefore considerably more
buttons are found on the supplied
infrared remote control I won't go over
all of them they are fairly
self-explanatory so I'll just include
some nice b-roll okay so at this point
you might have noticed the Sound Blaster
X katana employs a few RGB LED lights
xlix effect these programmable LED
lights lined the underside of the sound
bar and provide a cool ambient lighting
effect the lights can also be controlled
via the remote or using crazy impressive
sound blaster connect software now
please note the software isn't required
to use katana
but I recommend PC users install the
soundblaster Connect software to enable
better customization of audio profiles
LED lighting effects microphone noise
and voice processing effects
there is also an eight character LED
display front and center on the unit and
this can display useful information such
as the volume level it can also be
programmed to show the user's name or
anything else as long as it's 8
characters or less
finally the software allows users to
optimize their equalizer settings as
well as creative zone acoustic engine ok
so sound quality is highly subjective
but I would like to meet the person that
hears the sound blaster ex katana and
claims that this sound by anything but
amazing particularly given its compact
size my buddy Brian over at techy yes
city hasn't stopped talking this thing
up to me since he reviewed it and
honestly given the price I wasn't really
that interested however now having
tested it for myself firsthand I've got
to say even at $300 it's now very very
tempting 75 watts RMS is a lot of power
and the katana makes the most of it max
volume is very loud and the speaker
still sounds crisp and clear the bass is
also surprisingly punchy from that five
and a quarter inch long throw driver
something that really surprised me was
how wide the sound stage seems for a 600
millimeter long speaker the katana gives
the impression of being a much wider
speaker the Virtual Surround channel
effect was pretty amazing as well there
was also a very distinct difference
between the front and rear channels
still as impressed with katana as I was
I'm not trying to suggest that it offers
a better or even as good sound
experience as a dedicated 5.1 speaker
setup such as Logitech said 906
however for such a compact system I've
never heard anything as good as creative
soundblaster ex katana even though
someone always asks I'm not going to try
and show you guys what the speaker
sounds like recording the speaker using
my mic then compressing that audio
uploading it to youtube and then having
you play it back through whatever
speakers or audio device you have it
doesn't seem particularly useful or
accurate so let's just skip that step
right so now that I'm nearing the end of
my review I've been trying to work out
what if anything I don't like about
creative soundblaster excute onna
I guess given the price NFC support
would have been nice and our HDMI
pass-through would have opened up a few
more options as well perhaps even a USB
3 hub would have been cool since its
directly under your monitor the ability
to connect flash drives here or a
charger phone would have been a really
nice option short of that I couldn't
really come up with anything else of
course there is that steep asking price
but given the quality and what is on
offer here it's hard to fault creative
that said I feel around 250 us might be
a more appropriate price given the
competition in this market segment and
the good news here given how these
things usually go expect over the next
few months like Oh China will eventually
hit that price on sale anyway phone now
I think the soundblaster exit on ax is
going to replace my main desktop system
I just love how compact this thing is
and of course that audio quality what do
you guys think is it something you have
to hear first hand I mean it's a speaker
so yeah it kind of goes that saying
Brian didn't have me fully convinced
that was worth the asking price but
having now tested it I take it back
Brian
you all right anyway guys I'm your host
Steve let me know you think in the
comments below and I hope to catch on
the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
