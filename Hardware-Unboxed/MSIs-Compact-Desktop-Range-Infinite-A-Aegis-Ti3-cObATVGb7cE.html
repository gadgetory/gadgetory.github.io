Computex coverage i want to get on back
at the msi booth this time i'll be
checking out their new desktop computer
systems
yes pre-built desktop systems but before
you click away they are very cool and
offer flexible upgrade options if you're
in the market for a new gaming desktop
PC then check out MSI high-end core i7
systems also right now they are offering
a free you play game key for Tom
Clancy's Ghost Recon wildlands with
select purchases it's also possible to
score a wildland game code with select
MSI motherboards check out their x99
Dead 270 at h2 70 range link is in the
video description so I know the vast
majority of you do prefer to build your
own rigs and I totally get that building
your own system is just better you can
upgrade in the future you can select the
components that you want to use and
basically you can just tailor the system
to your needs as a PC components maker
MSI understands this all too well so
what they've done is put together the
same kind of pcs that your average gamer
would take the new ages ti3 for example
this is the new flagship desktop PC and
the specs will blow you away
fully optioned out it comes with not one
but two MSI GTX 1080 TI gaming 11g
graphics cards configured in sli up to
64 gigabytes of ddr4 memory to m2 SSDs
though only one of them can be an nvme
model I'm told by default when it comes
rocking a core i7 77k processor which
you can overclock as it's cool to buy a
custom ek liquid cooler the same is true
for the two GTX 1080 TI graphics cards
both have really nice-looking ek blocks
trapped on and this looks very much like
something you would find in our custom
made high-end desktop rig right me on
the left side door gives you access to
the graphics card as well as the dual m2
slots and memory dims is even an m dot
two slots take advantage of Intel's
octane technology in case you want to
boost the speed of the largest secondary
storage moving on to the top of the case
the plastic lid can be removed and doing
so allows you to open up the top
exposing a 120 millimeter radiator in
the process I should also note that in
the bottom section of the case there is
a 240
millimeter radiator and both the 240 and
120 millimeter radiators are included in
the same single loop the case has
essentially been split into three
sections the bottom of which is
basically the stand and here we find the
power supply then feature in the lower
section of the case we have the chamber
for the CPU cooling and above that in
the top half of the case you'll find the
graphics card and that of course is also
a separate chamber the ages TI 3 is a
mighty impressive looking pre-built
system and I'm keen to see what price
MSI slaps on this thing moving on we
have the infinite a and this will no
doubt be a more cost-effective pre-built
system when compared to the standard
version of the infinite the a10 gets a
nice big glass side panel and upgrade to
the b250 chipset from the H 110 support
for Intel obtain technology and support
for twice the memory capacity though the
previous model was ample at 32 gigabytes
the biggest upgrades have been made to
the GPU support whereas the standard
model maxed out of the gtx 1060 the
infinite a can be configured with the
gtx 1070 or gtx 1080
both of which are gaming ex models
whichever MSI gaming graphics card you
choose it will be stood vertically for
better heat dissipation and performance
MSI se but I think the real reason is it
just looks a bit better overall the
pre-built system weighs in at 15 kilos
and measures 210 millimeters wide 450
millimetres tool and 488 millimeters
deep it also includes things such as an
Intel dual band wireless AC a 550 watt
80 plus certified power supply slim dim
type DVD and a heap of front and rear
connectivity for those who prefer their
desktops looking clean and pure
the limited edition Trident 3 Arctic
might be a better choice this pre-built
system looks very much like a console
and it's available in either black or
white unlike a console though it packs
some serious hardware including a 7th
generation Intel Core processor and
nvidia geforce gtx 1070 and a 256
gigabyte m2 PCIe SSD well that's going
to do it for the MSI desktop systems
there were plenty of good looking gamer
alive display and was great to see
pre-built and gamers that are easy to
upgrade I'm your host Steve see again
and guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
