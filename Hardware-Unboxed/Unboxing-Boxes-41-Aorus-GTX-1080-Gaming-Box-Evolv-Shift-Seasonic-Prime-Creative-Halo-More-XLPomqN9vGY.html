unboxing boxes I remember what it was
called see good job Steve and yeah this
is a series where I take things out of
boxes and show you guys and I've been
doing it for a while now I haven't done
one for many weeks now and quite a few
of you who are fans of the series have
been hounding me to do one so guess what
I've got a couple of boxes and we're
gonna open them and see what's inside
for those of you new to the channel this
is just a silly little series that's
very different to the normal sort of
content on the channel where we do sort
of serious in-depth benchmarks and
comparisons with GPUs and CPUs and
whatever else this is just light-hearted
to sit back and mess around and see what
we've got started off as a bit of an
insight to see you guys or show you guys
what sort of stuff we get on a fairly
regular basis to feature on the channel
or test or whatever we may end up doing
with them I think what we have here is a
pair of cases by the looks of these big
boxes that are sort of shrink wrapped in
the PC case gear black garbage bags that
often refer to them as but we'll get
into these two first and then we have
three other sort of normal issue size
packages that we'll check out I'll start
with the biggest of the two which is
this one here okay black plastic off
first probably just to uh so first up
this big box here looks to contain the
fantex
evolved shift X computer case this is
pretty cool case from what I can tell
from what I've seen on other channels
it's not new I'm not the first person I
box it by any stretch of the imagination
but I did want to do a build with this
case I'll probably do it with this one
first we'll get to that in a minute
oh yeah the box we'll take a quick look
I won't go too in depth of this one
because yeah there's reviews and whatnot
so the unboxing won't be anything new
yep it's upside down of course there's
no way that's all fitting and the shot
is there I think I'm probably gonna have
to get some b-roll of this separately
because I'm not sure if that's fitting
on the top of the frame right so add a
guess I would say the top of this case
is currently being cut off
probably not feeding in the shot how
about that it's not working as you can
see it's a very tall and skinny case and
there's something loose in it
that's the accessory box well that is a
pretty awesome looking mini ITX case
it's very as you can see probably twice
as long as you probably expect it to be
since it is a mini ITX case but this one
is designed to fit full-length graphics
cards without a problem and full-length
graphics cards with water blocks on them
no less so you can put a full custom
liquid-cooled loop in this thing
radiator BGA block cpu block the whole
lot and with the glass panels on both
sides you can shot off quite well and it
can be laid flat down like that so you
can see all the liquid cooling stuff
from the top yeah very cool or of course
it can stand up and be out of shot at
the top but yet kind of brings new
meaning to the term tower style case
anyway I won't go too far into this
because I will be doing a custom build
in it soon I might do something like an
X 299 not liquid-cooled
building it with the new asrock mini ITX
but which I hope to have for the next
episode of unboxing boxes anyway for
those interested it is a hundred and
seventy dollars u.s. that's about two
hundred and twenty dollars E and I think
you can buy it for $220 Ozzie at PC case
key and the other guys that send this
out so big thank you to them alright
box number two looks like we have a
bonus box on top of this one okay and
yes we have the fantex
evolve shift which is basically the baby
version of that case I suppose you could
say
okay so this Alice ed is the smaller
version very similar design as you can
see about just smaller more compact and
it'll still fit a full length graphics
card which you'll go there there is the
gtx 1070 TI as an example so that is
pretty cool you can see it from around
that side hanging down below where the
motherboard will go but in a very cool
case and I plan to do quite powerful
building this probably Rison seven
seventeen hundred overclocked to four
gigahertz I will be using this little as
rock board that I unboxed on unboxing
boxes quite some time ago now it's been
just been sitting in the studio
collecting dust but this will be going
in there with some other very cool
hardware shortly so you'll see that
build on the channel very soon again I
won't go into too much detail or any
detail about these other than sort of
show you and talk about the price now
this one is a hundred and ten dollars
u.s. and it turns out to be about a
hundred and fifty dollars Aussie so for
the quality of the case it's actually a
really reasonable price love the way
this top opens up anyway more on that
when I get around to doing my build what
is in the mystery box it's very heavy ah
this will be handy it's a fan text air
cooler or the build I just talked it
just spoke about so if the TC 12 LS and
I so it's a low-profile cooler and very
low-profile as you can see there black
anodized heatsink that looks very cool
nickel-plated base and it looks like
we've got six heat pipes six millimeter
heat pipes and so that will probably go
on there something like that so
that will be good all right let's get
into this box and see what we have here
I honestly have no idea who this is from
or what it is hopefully it's something
interesting whoa oh yes that's I think
you'll agree this is quite interesting
especially for your mobile gamers it's
very heavy all right what we have here
is the gigabyte or gaming box and you've
seen the gaming box on channel probably
because Tim did quite a few videos on it
but this is the GTX 1080 model
previously they only had a 1070 model I
think I'll actually go through this box
properly and do an actual proper
unboxing can you believe that a proper
unboxing on unboxing boxes I think I'll
do that because it could be the first
unboxing of this product on the entire
Internet but if someone else beats me to
it because I took too long it and it and
get this video out I don't care no need
to tell me about it I said stop typing
let's get into it so for those of you
unaware this is a Thunderbolt 3 device
that's how it connects to your it's
pretty much designed for ultra books
that have integrated graphics and don't
play games very well basically they
don't have Intel's are upcoming chips
with the Radeon graphics they've just
got Intel HD graphics and they suck at
gaming so Tim tested out the 1070 model
and while quite impressive indeed make
ultrabooks that couldn't previously game
capable of gaming they were heavily
heavily cpu-bound
in most of the games tested like
battlefield 1 was terrible because
ultrabooks the well before the cable
Acree fresh they had dual-core
processors and as you guys know
basically they're like low clocked core
i3 s which aren't exactly great for
multiplayer games like Battlefield 1 and
so stuttering and whatnot was a problem
and there is a bit of latency with the
Thunderbolt 3 implementation opposed to
let PCI Express
so it wasn't great but now we do have
the KB Lake refresh ultrabooks with
quad-core processors and their of the
8000 new series at the core i5 8000 own
core i7 8000 new series and this should
complement those very nicely indeed I
think it comes in a cute little baggie
so nice and portable you can carry your
gaming box around it's pretty much
designed mostly to stay at home but
whatever you'll probably need your power
cord so a little handle as well if ok
tightly about half a kilo but if you
want to put a shoulder strap on go for
it all right
actually I said I'd do a proper unboxing
so in the box apart from the shoulder
strap you get a 3 pin kettle power cord
but missus I think it's a US power cord
by the looks of it anyway that won't
work in Australia got an adapter and
also on the package we have a
Thunderbolt 3 cable which is USB type-c
at each end so let's just have a look at
the device itself it's pretty nifty
little bag there's some side pockets and
things so you can put extra things in
there your cables and stuff so it is
quite a a neat little bag for those that
do plan on carrying their gaming box
around with their ultra portable
notebook things there I haven't actually
seen one of these in the flesh the 1070
model Tim reviewed that and I never
actually saw it looked fairly compact in
all of a roll and stuff II provided but
when you see it in person it's a I
assume this is the same as the 1070
model size-wise it looks like it's got a
very custom design 1080 in it'd be
interesting enough that is the same size
after check the specifications online
but yeah it's tiny absolutely tiny it's
a lot smaller than the bulky bag the
bags very padded so yeah out of the bag
it's even smaller than you might imagine
USB type-c Thunderbolt there with that
short little cable goes from there to
your laptop
Ultra book whatever you're using got
some USB so you can hang a few USB
devices off it then of course you can
plug an external monitor in as well if
you want to do that and I think that
actually works better but don't quote me
on that I can't exactly remember tim's
video i probably shouldn't admit to that
alright let's crack it open
tim will be reviewing this on the
channel by the way tim's busy with uni
exams still but he will be finishing up
very shortly and i will be catching up
with him will probably do a video or two
in a few weeks time and i'll be handing
this off to him and he'll be doing one
of his detailed reviews where he uses
our quad core ultra bulk plays a ton of
games and it'll compare it to what a
desktop 1070 would do so just gotta
remember how to put it back together for
tim it's like 36 degrees today and i've
had to turn the air conditioner off to
film and boy oh boy this room is heating
up fast this will probably end up being
a 30 minute episode like they often are
but if it's only 15 minutes you'll know
why well there is a sneak peak of the
innards so on this side we have the gtx
1080 graphics card a very compact ITX
type version as you can see there but it
does have a massive fan over the front
of it over a reasonable heatsink we've
got three copper pipes copper heat pipes
i should say - eight mil and one six mil
and that's covering all the memory chips
as well and no doubt the vrm components
and that's got a single 8 pin connector
so that's standard g4 fan blades come
very close to that PCB down there very
close indeed it's like a millimeter and
then on the other side we have a black
small form-factor sfx power supply
something along those lines there
there's a couple of very small fans
there as well to draw some extra cool
air or they're actually exhaust fans
remove any hot air I should say from
inside the unit so there's an unboxing
and very limited teardown of the gaming
box GT X 1080 version anyway I'll pop
that back together a bit later on when I
make you sit through all that and then
Tim will provide a detailed review
oh yeah well we're just finally it does
come with one of those shiny drink
coasters so that's cool we've seen that
with a few products recently mostly
motherboards but good to see you get one
of those with this and then a quick
installation guide very very quick I
suppose there's not a whole lot to it
and a very nifty little carry bag will
pop it back in there gets in snug ok
second last box how are we doing for
time no idea blunt knife strikes again
that tape puts up a fight these days
what do we have here some UPS bags lots
and lots of UPS bags I can add them to
my UPS bag collections that's nice very
nice shiny box amongst all the UPS bags
very heavy one well that explains why
that package was so heavy it has a 1000
watt C sonic power supply 80-plus
titanium model let's get that out
quickly and have a look I actually
believe when I spoke to see sonic last
about this I was expecting this for a
little while they're going to provide me
with one of these or at least one of
these maybe a couple of them I can't
remember the fine details are all
announced that probably in a video soon
they were talking about some see sonic
iron power supply giveaways and I'm sure
it's probably something you guys are
interested in and I'll just do that as
an exclusive for you guys that are
subscribed to the channel so maybe a
joint thing with other channels alright
let's get into this very shiny box and
see what we have okay so it comes with a
huge assortment of cable ties and velcro
straps and other things so that's very
cool a couple of different manuals and
things another US power cord so as we
saw it is an 80 plus titanium model and
I believe it has something like 92 or 94
I think it's 94% efficiency at 50% loads
that's a very impressive indeed as we
can see already it is a fully modular
power supply and there are a heap of
connectors on the back of this thing so
you'll have no trouble running some sort
of high-end thread Ripper or
x29 iron system of this so in the top
here it has a massive one hundred and
thirty-five millimeter fluid dynamic
bearing fan basically very low friction
generated by the fans bearing design if
you will so it creates a very little
noise very little where it's at will
last a long time
speaking of lasting a long time yeah ten
years is a pretty extreme warranty when
I see a PC or a tech part with a 10 year
warranty it's like wow that's a
seriously premium product that they
really believe in well this one has a 12
year warranty so while it might be
pricey I'll mention the price in a
minute
that is an extreme warranty period 12
years Wow
get your money's worth of a pea little
bits of plastic as well so this is I
probably haven't said the full name yet
it is the C Sonic prime ultra 1,000 watt
power supply it does cost two hundred
and sixty dollars u.s. and I don't have
an Aussie price yet but would have to be
around three hundred and seventy years
so obviously a very premium high-end
power supply about yeah the 1200 watt
titanium a rated power supply so the
price seems appropriate so that's
hopefully I've thrown up a bit of b-roll
you guys can get a good look around the
unit and now in this second little bag
here we have a heap of flat black cables
so again it's 100 100% modular design
and you get a massive massive amount of
cables
so in the cables you do get a sleeved
what is a 24-pin power cable so that's
good to see
and there ask them are just flat black
cables which is fine
probably not as desirable as these sort
of individually sleeved cables that we
recently saw on a couple of power
supplies I looked at but you know
they're still good and you do get 14
SATA power cables so that's obviously a
lot it's it's 14 how you also get where
are they yep that's what we want an 8
pin or 8 + 8 / 6 pin PCI Express power
connector apparently there are eight of
these in this pile here and then we get
our that's cool as well as you can
convert the molex connectors to another
to solder characters so that's cool I
believe there is something like 5 mullux
connectors in turtle which probably
looks about right I'm saying we've got
two there and three there there's our
five well done and we also have I
believe - there's one and there's not -
there with me yes we have two of the
eight pin CPU power connector so again
that's really good for your thread
Ripper and your sky like X platforms so
plenty of power connectors cables and
whatnot to go with your hi and see sonic
power supply and yeah I'll get more
information hopefully we will be giving
away this particular unit on the channel
in the not-too-distant future
and I'll probably feature this in a
build I might even use it in the swift X
bills
alright last box just fairly light so
you'll see what's inside
so far we have some white foam behind
that white finally have a FedEx bag to
go with our UPS bags and we have
creative outlier sport or in the sports
sports we also have a bag of bubble wrap
check that out in a minute
and we have some more creative
headphones these are the creative flex
so let's have a closer look at those
we'll start with the Flex I'll move that
and that there well I've made a massive
massive mess in here but anyway the
creative flex well that's a very very
light package to start off with yeah we
get into it well quite obviously this is
a headset of sorts looks like it's got a
couple of interesting features and cool
thing about them is that they are
relatively cheap there are only about
$50 I think they're exactly $50 in fact
Australian so that would make them very
cheap in the US but I couldn't actually
find any US pricing for them so yeah
maybe $30 ish u.s. so they obviously
fold flat so nice and compact and right
away you can tell or I can tell you can
well you can probably assume based on
what they look like they are quite light
136 grams so extremely light I can
probably to adjust them in a bit
obviously a wired headset and they have
a very small inline controller it looks
like just mutes and something pretty
cool here is you can change they
probably see if they slide out you can
change the sort of like the color I like
the little colour decal here the
trimming if you will so you can go blue
if you want there you go that's pretty
swanky or you can go sort of greenish
colour or you can just be plain and
boring and you can go like a charcoal
wish grayish color so ultra light
folding headphones
as you can see you've got the right and
left in there you can even go in you
could go multicolored if you want so you
could sort of go with the orange color
and the blue color so pretty rebellious
136 trams they have a 1.2 meter cord so
that reach for each down your phone or
whatever is in your pocket very easily
so the drivers are 32 millimeters I'm a
stellar seizure there
and they do have neodymium magnets in
them so nice and responsive and all that
sort of stuff for color tabs covered
that and they have a limited one-year
warranty
suppose we'll give them a quick try
they're mostly plastic design but you
know you'd expect that for the price
they do seem hinges and everything on
them look quite thick quite big so I'd
say they're quite robust Wow they are
significantly more bassy than I was
expecting I don't know how well the mic
will pick this up they're a lot more
bassy than expect definitely probably
can't hear me
and that's not a mute button it is a
pause play button so there's no volume
control on the headphones themselves so
very limited controls in that sense but
you can control that sort of stuff from
the phone anyway alright next up we have
the outlier sports are actually pretty
keen to try these out because I've used
the boxes up there somewhere the jaybird
freedom is a bit like white like those
but they're very expensive there is the
freedom f5 I think they are and they're
about $100 u.s. well these are just $70
u.s. so significantly cheaper than even
the cheapest jaybird freedoms and I
believe probably says on the Box
somewhere somewhere yep 11 our playback
between charges and for those of you
unaware the freedom f5 rated up to 8
hours so we've got the orange ones here
and I believe the so you can get them in
neo green green midnight blue which is
dark blue and a fiery orange which is
kind of like fluo orange I suppose or
fiery orange well due to the funky
colors and whatnot they look quite
different to the freedoms but sort of
design wise they're very similar so
you've got rubberized cabling I believe
that's about 50 centimetres half a meter
long you've got the controls here you
charge it up using micro USB as you
would an Android phone or pretty much
any other device volume up and down and
then maybe mute pause play something
like that so these are obviously
Bluetooth headphones so I'd have to pair
them with my phone which I will do in a
moment we'll test them out and see what
they sound like they are sweat proof
ipx4 rated Eric's extremely extremely
light 15 grams in total for what you see
here so you're very light indeed you'd
barely know you're wearing them and like
the headphones we just saw here they
have a 1
limited warranty which isn't huge but
they're not massively expensive either
so you probably don't really expect a
premium warranty they sound really nice
as well lots of bass that's max volume
no idea how that sounds on the mic but
anyway they do sound very nice a few
different silicon size small medium and
large and then the same goes for little
Finn things that go in your ears so a
few different sizes there's also a clip
to clip it on
so yeah that's for the money it's really
nice I'd say a kind of rival the high
end freedoms to be honest with you with
the sound quality if they do last up to
11 hours
that's impressive anyway moving on oh
yeah they said Center buttons obviously
power on and off and pairing so okay and
lastly we have the bubble wrap thing
whoa whoa okay that's pretty disco try
me whoa is pretty cool I'm gonna have to
get some b-roll of that well I don't
know if creative were the first to do it
but RGB has now made it to portable
Bluetooth speakers so that is good to
see I was worried I was thinking when
are we going to get RGB portable
Bluetooth speakers well now is the
answer
all right so that was almost not worth
to struggle because all you do is you
know micro USB cable for charging it no
doubt that looks like it has an auxilary
input as well so you don't just have to
use the Bluetooth so we've got
rubberized controls on top power volume
up/down pause play bluetooth phone
button a brightness button no doubt for
your RGB lighting so that's very cool so
this little guy here is $70 us it is the
halo creative halo I don't think there's
anything else to the name creative halo
nailed it $70 u.s. 130 dollars
Australian so it's actually pretty good
for a portable Bluetooth speaker
especially if it turns out to be quite
nice quality I believe there's a pair of
speakers in this thing they're probably
they're in there at a guess no idea
really it's got a rubberized base and it
has a tripod mount so you could mount
that on a sort of designer type tripod
in the corner of your room or something
like that and then this mirror finish
you with the RGB lighting as you just
saw that is very funky indeed in total
it is 510 grams so basically half a kilo
again it comes with a one-year warranty
like the other two creative products we
just checked out and yeah they're
quoting up to eight hours of battery
life probably without the RGB lights no
doubt they have the battery time but who
cares they look awesome fire it up it
sounds exactly like the road waiting for
device to connect like the IRA or and a
lot sort of stuff so it's
so that's quite loud so if you keep
pushing the light button it true it goes
through a few different pre-programmed
effects it says the light effects are
programmable I don't know if it just
means that or if there's like an app for
your phone where you can sort of change
the effects of the lights I don't know
that's something I'll have to look into
but either way that is pretty cool
something different as I said I'll
probably flatten it a lot faster but
cool nonetheless I have the sound
quality and volume and all that is very
impressive especially for the money and
you're a little handle there so you can
carry it around I like it
so that's going to do it for this
episode of unboxing boxes we had quite a
few different things to look at a couple
of big cases but didn't go into them too
much you'll see them in much more detail
on the channel very shortly some pretty
cool audio products from creative very
nice-looking power supply from C sonic
we also got this cool little heatsink
from fan text as well which will be
going on the am4 build using that as
rock motherboard I showed you of course
we've got the gaming box with the GT X
1080 that looks mighty impressive and I
can't like to see Tim's benchmark
results on that hopefully we'll have to
wait too long for those I'll get Tim
onto that straightaway he's got quite a
few things he has to get through but
anyway that is going to do it for this
episode of unboxing boxes hope you guys
enjoyed I'll see you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
