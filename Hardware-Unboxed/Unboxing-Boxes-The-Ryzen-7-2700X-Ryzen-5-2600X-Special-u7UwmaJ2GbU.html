with my co-host Tim and where are we Tim
where it's been unusual isn't it
there's Lego so it has to be tim set
yeah but this is Tim's new set so no
garage door anymore
no shiny new ceiling no not a shame at
all yeah so anyway yeah new set for Tim
but we have two boxes here two very big
boxes and a sheet here saying second-gen
risin processes what could be in these
boxes I don't know but we're going to
find out I'll uh I'll start with mine go
huh the knife yeah put your fingers yeah
watch the fingers and whatever is in the
box
try not to amputate it alright nothing
exciting yet oh uh
alright I'll fold that away don't you
hurtin yourself okay
it's a very heavy box I don't know if
this is gonna go well or not there's not
a whole lot of desk that way say the
suspense is killing everyone another box
so we have another box we're unboxing
boxes as we often do okay we've got a
big black box there and what looks to be
probably the processor box says Verizon
it's all okay that's a loaded box that
that is a very heavy box which one
should we start let's go the one I've
almost brilliant
I'll check this one up here for you yeah
okay
try that again so in this one Sarah says
2nd generation processes feel like
everything's about to a nice full layout
exciting stuff alright so this is the
review kit so AMD has provided some nice
G skilled sniper X memory
and that is 3400 sales 16 stuff so yes
16 get kit 3400 that is promising all
right we have the X 474 s gaming 7 or
Wi-Fi so a motherboard we have 2
motherboards nice tight G love a touchy
board so there's rock Tai Chi ultimate
so that's what I got
I think there's a protein frame for you
but yeah yeah I don't sit too close to
Tim yes well maybe I'll go over some of
the news portion of this unboxing while
you unbox what's in your oh I have done
this we have done the main show yet did
here be the end of myself today again
looks very nice so we've got ok little
flyer there so this will be the X model
so AMD's not sampling the 9x models at
this point yes this is the risin 520 600
X in this box over here rise in 720 700
X this one is definitely heavier cuz
it's got a different cooler units yes
this one's got the wraith prism I
believe let's just look a little sheet
wraiths aspire in this one so well do
you want to open those and have a bit of
a look yeah show the cooler off well I
talked about so the horizon 720 700 X
that will be 330 a us that's the MSRP at
the moment based kalakar 4.3 gigahertz
up 3.7 gigahertz base 4.3 you hertz
maximum single core and of course that's
net core 16 3 shut you push the oh come
on Tim yeah and a 20 mega byte level
watches 20 megabytes worth of cash cash
total so this is in this box is the 2600
X like a CPU at the front there so
you get your little risin five sticker
as well as the CPU itself we'll take a
look at that at the moment this is the
probably top b-roll of that cuts very
small this is a great spire cooler which
they've used before from I understand
yep to do you a coulis you know it's got
the copper slug yep bomb there will show
some b-roll of this as well
I think we actually like to disclose
that information I've got no idea many
of you will have to edit that out
I don't know bunch of these supposed to
say what's on the sheet yeah okay we'll
ask well let's get MD contact about that
and I'm only guessing I don't know the
official information okay so that's the
2700 700 next again you get you a nice
little risin 7 sticker up the top there
for that one and this is the new cooler
that we can talk about for sure
the risin I've clicked the longer is the
affair never on love is a clear fan so
this thing that's a favorite of copper
on that get a cable for the RGB miss of
this fan as well so yeah they've made
some improvements to this particular
cooler to make it more compatible with
motherboards so along the edges here
they've made some changes to the shape
of the fins so that you know if you
really tight motherboard you get better
clearance for your RAM and so forth
there's an RGB ring around the outside
and in the fan as well so you get that
nice RGB effect which of course MD is
very proud of heat pipes draw heat pipes
and that goes directly to this large
copper base on the bottom so yeah you
get this really nice coverage and
obviously the filler face is applied
there sorry yes ok strict touch direct
eye contact you know a big copper slug
so yeah so that looks really nice yeah
that's why it's so heavy but yes you
only get that particular call up with
the 2700 X if you get the 2700 or the
2600 X you get this cooler
the Wraith the spire and then with the
rise of 520 600 you get the Wraith is
still yes which we won't be covering on
the 19th so we're only happy to X models
unfortunately but I'll be getting one of
the non x models as quick as I can
whether I have to buy on release day or
whatever we'll do it
okay well let's neatly pack these all
back away
okay so they're all my goodies I get to
use this fantastic knife again yes check
all your fingers after use every time
this thing is a serious bass it is
tonight yeah just don't push too hard
cuz it'll burst through that box and
you'll have many rising processes
none of them will work cut my fingers
off of me just a great way to continue
this video survived all the power tools
yesterday building the set so to be just
right to up the night hands your
surprise is exactly what you never saw
it coming so again we've got to be keep
of CPS yeah we probably don't need to go
into those again I'm just keen to say
did you get the same mother or not I
assume the same memory
I think that's upside down he's a novice
unbox of this guy so once again it's
looking familiar
come on team we have got the same oh
well let's uh oh hang on no yes that's
the same memory of the same careers and
a sous board as well that is been
providing some review gets the crosshair
7-0 so the cost there's six zeroes up
there and successor to that one
basically X 470 and MSI was meant to be
getting their motherboard as well
something's happened there anyway
they've still providing one so we should
have that in time for the review on the
19th so we'll have plenty of X 470
motherboards to test out and we'll be
doing comparisons with the X 370 was
letting you guys know what the deal is
there and yeah we are allowed to say a
few things that the X 470 bores the
difference that is sort of providing
obviously x3 7 is also compatible with
Rison - one of the things is apparently
they have tweaked the power delivery
mechanisms on the motherboard so there's
potentially you will get different sort
of clock speed behavior up on the X 470
boards let's just stop talking about the
X 470 stuff and you guys probably just
want to see an X 470 motherboard up the
boxes so since we have essentially
doubles of everything let's get rid of
my stuff here so they're heavy boards
x47 a Taichi Ultimates lots of crazy
stuff in here 10 Gigabit Ethernet front
USB 3.1 gen2 type-c it's got Wi-Fi rule
m dot 2 watts
pretty fancy we've got some serious very
I'm cooling on both boards because
they're boasted very heavy so there's a
look at the gigabyte board this one's
got something falling off of there
hey you can have another got that while
you're doing that I will talk about this
board from what I can see it looks like
ten plus two phase vrm and a guest and
let's say yes ten plus two and it has
direct touch heat sinks or heat pipes on
top of the MOSFETs so and we've actually
got proper finned heat sinks on both
rows this that's very cool so we should
see a pretty good erm temps on this
board which like we got to m dot two
slots
it's got a little sort of shield
heatsink backplate thing so that looks
pretty cool I'll give that one to you
don't get rid of some of this packaging
unit there's a massive m dot to sort of
heat spreader heat shield type thing
they're impressive board this has an
eight plus four pin input for the CPU
and so does the gigabyte board you know
plenty of power input so there you go
our export seventy boards we don't know
much about them yet we obviously haven't
used them but I plan on testing the new
horizon second gen rising CPUs on these
boards as well as the X 370 boards and
vice versa so the first gen rising CPUs
will also test on these and see if
there's any difference there if they can
take advantage of any higher frequency
memory and stuff like that and give you
guys all the details this time next week
on the channel when we have something
like probably a 20 minute plus video
testing and trying to find out
everything we can in a single video have
we mentioned the release date and can we
mention release date well this time next
week I pre much the Senate's yeah 19th
same time this video went up yep if we
can't mention it sorry aim D yeah and
just for CPUs this time around no 2800 X
or equivalent just for us so well last
time they only really strives in seven
first and then right answer so but it's
looking like that anyway that makes
sense at the moment yes 2005 2007 new x4
70 boards yep and yeah that new cooler
as well so fun stuff I know this was
just the unboxing with extremely very
very little information but you know
that's just how things go these days and
in a week you're gonna say all the
details and all the benchmarks and all
the good stuff so thanks for watching
this unorganized rushed unboxing of
stuff that some of it was broken some of
it wasn't so yeah if you like this video
of course give us a thumbs up for our
you know news corner slash unboxing
boxes very nice grifted yeah hybrid
video and as always subscribe because
you don't want to miss that rising
coverage on first day when that comes
out next week and of course support us
on patreon as well patreon.com slash
hardware unboxed we'll catch you next
time hey guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
