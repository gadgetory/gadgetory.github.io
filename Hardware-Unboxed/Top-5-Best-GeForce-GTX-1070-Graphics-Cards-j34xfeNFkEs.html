talking in best geforce gtx 1070
graphics cards however rather than just
pick five models that i think of the
Ducks nuts we're going to get all
technical and break things down into
categories full disclaimer this is an
opinion piece so some of the pics are
based on my own hands-on experience
while others were selected based on
research from trusted sources having
checked out a rather large range of gtx
1070 graphics cards now i have a pretty
good idea of which direction to see you
guys in in fact the entire reason this
video came about was because on an
almost daily basis someone asked me
which model they should buy sometimes
it's a gtx 1070 other times it's an RX
580 for example or sometimes it's
something completely different anyway I
thought I'd start with my gtx 1070 picks
and go from there if you guys liked this
kind of video please let me know in the
comments below and i can really apply it
to any kind of pc however that be CPUs
or motherboards or whatever else please
note that this is not sponsored content
some of the brands mention this video
had sent me however in the past but that
in no way influences my recommendations
okay so the categories included our best
value best compact gamer best
overclocker
best liquid-cooled all-in-one and best
overall design so let's get to it
so right off the bat this is probably
going to be my most controversial pick
but hear me out
a few months ago I reviewed the galaxy
gtx 1070 exo-k x OC white and i found it
to be a very underrated graphics card
priced at $400 u.s. or five hundred and
twenty dollars aussie it is one of the
cheapest gtx ten seventies you can get
your hands on in both the US and
Australia us shoppers will have to refer
the galaxy store where various versions
of the card are available you get the
white or the black version and again
they're selling for $400 out of the box
performance is excellent and overclocked
it had no trouble matching the more
premium products and the likes of MSI
and gigabyte I also really liked the
cards aesthetics and in particular the
build quality was excellent feature
all metal design no plastic heat shrouds
here then if for whatever reason you
don't like or can't get your hands on
the galaxy TX 1070 EXO C then I
recommend checking out their soos gtx
1070 joule OC it's another great value
gtx 1070 graphics card now there are
three key contenders for the best
compact gtx 1070 graphics card the zotac
mini MSI's aero ITX and gigabytes mini
ITX all three equality products but I
would pick either the gigabyte or msi
versions for a few reasons
first of all there are almost 20% more
compacted just 17 centimeters long while
the zotac card spans a comparatively
long 21 centimeters they're also much
more cost-effective at about $400 u.s.
or five hundred and seventy dollars
Australian yeah under the zotac Mini is
nowhere to be found while over in the US
it costs an insane five hundred and
forty dollars so pricing alone makes the
gigabyte or MSI cards the more obvious
choices despite their tiny stature these
small 10 seventies run reasonably cool
and quiet while maintaining a boost
frequency of at least 1.8 gigahertz when
gaming which is quite a bit better than
in videos much larger and much more
expensive found as Edition version so if
you're after a super compact nano like
graphics card that still packs a serious
punch these little guys deliver the
question is which one should you buy
honestly there are both a very similar
so in my opinion go with whichever ones
cheaper the gigabyte model is
overclocked a smidge higher out of the
box but the MSI card runs a degree or
two cooler and it is quite a bit quieter
given the MSI card is around 10 decibels
quieter and the gaming load this is
probably the way I would go given the
option
truth be told the best overclocker
category doesn't really make sense or
probably isn't worth it with the geforce
ten series particularly the mid to lower
end team model such as the gtx 1070 or
gtx 1060 there are a few reasons for
this most notably of which is the fact
that the gtx 1070 runs at a maximum GPU
boost 3.0 frequency of 1.9 gigahertz
if thermals and power targets are within
the optimal range the very best cards
hit around
2.1 gigahertz which is only a 10 percent
overclock so with the 1070 is already
running near their maximum operating
frequency out of the box that doesn't
leave much wriggle room for overclockers
to work with in the past for example
i've managed to extract between 5 and
10% more performance so hardly anything
to get excited about having said a lot
though there are some cards that hold
their peak boost frequency really well
and they're just a bit easy to work with
for me the best overclock rough come
across as MSI's gtx 1070 gaming xhg and
I've heard many others also having quite
a bit of success with this model
therefore if you are keen on exploring
the limits of the gtx 1070 this is the
model i'd recommend it's also very
reasonably priced which is another
reason why i'm selecting it at $450 us
though it is a little more pricey down
under typically selling for about six
hundred and thirty dollars australian
most of the all-in-one liquid-cooled
geforce ten series graphics cards sport
a gtx 1080 GPU or greater that said
there are a few gtx 1070 liquid core
models to choose from the best of which
in my opinion comes from EVGA they have
two models on offer the standard gtx
1070 hybrid gaming and the for the wind
model basically if you plan on custom
overclocking the graphics card and you
probably should since its liquid cooled
get the for the wind model as it
features a significantly upgraded vrm
and an extra 8 pin power input
it also comes more aggressively
overclocked out of the box and features
fancy RGB lighting EVGA are also only
charging a $40 us premium for upgrade so
to me that seems fair pricing over in
the u.s. is very reasonable
the base model sells for just four
hundred and forty five dollars u.s.
making an exceptionally good buy down
under expect to pay about seven hundred
eighty dollars
then for the for the wind model which I
recommend that's about four hundred and
eighty dollars so only about a forty
dollar premium like I said as a side
note if you can happily accommodate the
120 millimeter radiator and your build
then this might be a better candidate
than MSI gaming x4 the best overclocker
so keep that in mind okay the best
overall design hmm a category I wish I
didn't create if I'm honest okay so full
disclaimer this one is completely based
on my own opinion I mean they all have
been but this one probably more so let's
just say if I had my pick of any gtx
1070 out there right now which one will
I choose by this I mean price isn't a
factor I mean if it were I probably
wouldn't be going with any of these
choices I'd be getting the most
cost-effective option for sure as this
is a gtx 1070 and not a 1080 TI anyway
let's just assume it's free as I try and
work out which card to go for I really
understand why potential buyers have a
hard time with this I'm torn between the
gigabyte or s card there soos ROG Strix
the palette gamer a premium edition of
the MSI gaming X oh and gigabyte
stealthy looking rock 8g that's a cool
looking card as well of course there's
even more options it's really like they
say the list goes on
still if I had to pull the trigger on
just one I think I'd once again go with
the EVGA gtx 1070 for the win hybrid
gaming it's an awesome looking gtx 1070
build quality is second to none and out
of the box nothing beats that the only
issue here being that for pretty much
the same money you can pick up a base
model gtx 1080 so keep that in mind when
investing in a premium gtx 1070 graphics
card for me this is why my best value
picks make the most sense well there you
have it my gtx 1070 picks out of those
categories i feel the best value and
best compact gamer are probably the most
useful for shoppers as they make the
most sense when purchasing a gtx 1070
that's like I said earlier there's no
point spending a huge amount of money on
1070 because you could just get a 1080
anyway that's my opinion of course if
you disagree with any or all of my
please let me know in the comments below
always keen to hear what you guys think
if you enjoyed this style of video and
would like more be sure to let me know
why I should cover next for those of you
who are a keen on another big benchmark
video don't panic I do have something in
coming very soon as I compare the array
on our x5 60 and geforce gtx 1050 i will
probably throw in the 1050 TI as well
and those cars will be tested in 30
video games so it's going to be a big in
i also have a few other really exciting
benchmark projects on the horizon so
keep an eye out for them i mean how you
Steve see you next time guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
