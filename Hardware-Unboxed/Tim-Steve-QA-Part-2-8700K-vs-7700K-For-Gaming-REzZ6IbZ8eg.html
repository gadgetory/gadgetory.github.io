the Q&amp;amp;A session with Tim he's gonna
appear in a moment if you missed
yesterday's video then you probably want
to check that at first I'll provide a
link in the video description alright
next question is from Maddy he says hey
guys how do you write these 77 okay
compared to the 87 or okay purely for a
gaming rig only thanks in advance love
your work thank you very much okay well
right now for gaming I'd say there's no
noticeable difference between the semi
center okay and 87 okay for pretty much
99.9 percent of the games out there and
that really goes for even for guys that
are using like a GTX 10 ATT I'm probably
the next gen stuff as well having said
all that though there is no way I would
be investing in a 77 okay today even
though the 87 ROK is still more
expensive and out of stock I still would
it's kind of a weird time to buy right
now because you've got you know seventy
seven okay there but then it's at the
end of the road you could get the 87
okay if it was in stock but then it's
like $60 u.s. a price I wouldn't buy it
for that either because I don't like
buying things above the MSRP because you
know next week you could have saved $60
us potentially and they are ramping up
supply of the 87 okay at the moment so
yeah and just the fact that the 77 okay
has 33% fewer cores and threads and it
cost the same amount
I just couldn't pull the trigger one run
pull the trigger on one right now as a
weird kind of Anarchy bear with me it's
a bit like if the horizon 5 1500 X and
risin 5 1600 were the same price so
that's the four core risin 5 versus the
6 core rise and 5 processor imagine
actually probably worse than that
because you'd have to imagine that the
1500 X was actually an AM 3 processor so
the dead older platform and at the 1600
was on the current AM for platform
because that's gonna give you sent me
senator Kay a similar comparison
so in summary with the 87 RK out of
stock and overpriced
just wait at this point it's just a
matter of months now till we have rise
on two which is what we talked about
early in the video that's hopefully yeah
I'm fairly confident from what I've been
hearing I have no concrete information
but yeah I think we'll see that a lot of
news reports are talking sort of
February so yeah what was it was it much
this year I got the roses yes is it like
CES sort of timeframe yeah so I'd be
shocked if by March we didn't have
horizon 2 on deck and of course Intel
also has well we suspect Intel has an
eight-course 16 thread CPU for the LGA
1151 platforms so that'll be something a
notch up from the 87 or okay but that'll
cost more money for sure yeah whereas
the 87 Recces is $20 us more than the 77
okay so it's going to be in stock soon
so like absolute latest I would say in
January if I had to guess but sooner so
for all those reasons I mentioned I
wouldn't buy a 77 or okay even notes
right now indistinguishable from the 87
okay for gaming alright so the next
question is from Swann and Aaron
hopefully I didn't screw that one up as
well but you know it's probably been a
lot of that um question to Tim is the
new Raven Ridge worth it or should I
wait for pinnacle Ridge more
specifically is the new 2500 you worth
it so those who don't know Raven Ridge
is the mobile risin ship that MD has
launched unfortunately though I haven't
tested it yet and I haven't even gotten
word that I'll be getting one seems like
AMD has been a bit slack on this
particular Lodge can't get my hands on
out of time so yeah it's hard to say at
the moment whether it's worth it because
I haven't barely compare it to Intel's
8th gen parts but what I have seen is
that at least the laptops that do have
Raven Ridge at the moat they are cheaper
than some of the equivalent you know
laptops with Intel 8 June CPUs and the
key advantage is going to be that extra
GPU power that you get from the you know
Vega cause in there so I'm really
curious to see how that works I'm also
curious to see how am do you sort of
crammed there for Zen cause as well as
that GPU into the same TDP is what Intel
uses for their 8th gen parts obviously
the the latest 8th gen parts are also a
quad cores but they have weaker graphics
so yeah I'm pursuing your aim he's
bringing a lot of throttling to get it
down to that TDP and 15 watts that's
very tight to fit both you know the
Rison in there as well as that you know
Vega GP that's apparently you know it
could be two or three times faster than
you know the Intel equivalent so yeah
I'm really keen to be testing it out but
know like I said I haven't got any test
systems at the moment so just get that
waiting for it
yeah I thought AMD would be really keen
yes that stuff out and have guys testing
it's showing the results even if they're
not that readily available I still like
a coffee like if you will yeah what the
thing with AMD in the mobile spaces they
fight really hard to get their chips
into life that's true the high quality
ultrabook products where Intel is just
yeah all over this HP yeah a usual part
like HP and they usually you know the
more entry levels you know computers so
yeah I'm really hoping in the next
couple of you know months and so forth
that will start getting those you know
big design wins from AMD yeah I think as
well like I wouldn't be worrying too
much about rising to that will be again
you know desktop launch to begin with
when it comes to their future product
you'll still have to wait you know
probably towards the end of next year -
see ya - see them push it down to their
mobile stuff yeah hopefully Raven Ridge
can break the ice there or is it
pinnacle Ridge
yeah sorry just leave it at tomb yeah so
hopefully we will see some testing once
they get my hands on the laptop there
hazard in hopefully soon you'll see that
straight on the channel really excited
about yeah a lot of guys are asking for
that I know nothing about it and haven't
got a sample so Tim will be taking care
of all that mobile benchmark er all
right so we've got another question or a
new question from Patricia Hernandez
I built a budget system early this year
with the G 45 60 and a 560 Ti
but I decided to prepare for a bare CPU
so I bought a Z 270 board order to
upgrade to an i7 later sure I get an
7700 K or upgrade my motherboard and get
an 80 700 K I'm getting a 1060 soon by
the way so I think this one for you
Steve yeah okay so upgrading to a 1060
well anyone to get a core i7 yes okay
well if you're only upgrading to a 1060
and that's yeah what your going to be
getting soon I wouldn't be going for a
core i7 CPU as nice as they sound it's
probably going to be massive massive
overkill for a gaming system with a 1060
especially because well you sort of have
to go I see where he's coming from
because on the dead 270 platform you
really want eight threads now because
we're coming to sort of the end of the
core i5s
I would probably be looking at selling
the G 45 60 ml z 270 board and if I was
to buy right now probably a core i5 8400
so six cause there that's a really
really good way to go and yeah like I
said anything core i7s pretty much
overkill I think that's meant to be
about $109 us turn atala CPU when it's
in stock and that's the other problem
there because really take advantage of
the core i5 8400 you want the budget
motherboards which don't exist a Zedd
370 boards are getting down to 110 ish
hundred and twenty dollars us but that's
nothing like the 60 to 70 dollars we
should see the B 360s at so I guess it's
kind of that situation where that time
of the year now where people are really
saying wait to buy because like we said
we've got hopefully Rison to in a couple
of months and that could really change
things on the CPU landscape and GPU new
GPU is probably yeah they probably a bit
further away next year but that might
knock down prices of GPU so right now
I'd say if you've got you what is it the
560 Ti that he had and a g40 560
probably hold on to them make do with
them for now ride it out till early next
year because then you'll have the
availability of B 360 boards with a
hopefully they'll be in supply the
coffee-like CPUs Core i5 8400 that would
be Core i5 8400 with the GTX 1060 that
would be awesome
yeah or by that stage it'll be probably
a month and you'll see what rise in two
hours to offer and that may knock down
the price of coffee lake or you might
just go that's good Rison to processor
or it'll knock down the can't rise and
cps so yeah our advice is just wait next
question is from Ali chakra I said that
one it's my turn
do you guys ever get tired
by the schedules or do you relax if
needed well Tim probably can answer that
one just yet you will be able to soon
trust me from my personal experience
this she has been pretty brutal with the
schedules cuz you can't guys just keep
saying yo Steve you know take a break
you look tired just take some time off
unfortunately you just can't do that
YouTube doesn't allow breaks are not
allowed you really have to be doing
content pretty much every day at this
point sad reality if you don't you just
don't go anywhere so if you want people
to watch your videos and be able to do
this full-time you've got to pump the
continent you got to keep doing it so
yeah we're showing Tim we were talking
about a couple of there's a few Aussie
guys that do reviews and there's a
couple other tech channels around the
world do really high quality work like
surprisingly really good contents
impressive stuff and they just don't get
the views they deserve because they're
doing one video a week and YouTube's
just like one video a week go away we
don't want to push your content so yeah
it can be pretty hard knowing that
you've put all this time and effort no
big benchmark video and you're exhausted
from doing that and then the next day so
all I want to get a video up if you take
that off its really the next day you've
got to get a video out so yeah that's
definitely the challenge of YouTube but
I think even tech sites face that as
well like daily news you have to have
multiple updates every day all the
Google search just ignores the website
so yeah I think there's times in the
year when you know there's more product
launches all at once and there's times
in year where you know there's not as
many launches to cover and often you
know with the you know embargoes and
stuff you have to deal with it can be
you're really tight to have a lot of
embargoes at once yeah I think we had
that this year with Vega and yeah a few
times I was just like Tim please finish
you need help yeah so a time like you
know December and January and February
can be yes we quiet compare some of the
other months yeah we still have to get
the content out you know on a daily
basis that you were saying so yeah there
was I think Rison just AMD there was I
can't remember the order but I think it
was was a thread Ripper Rison three
vague oh yeah time middle
yeah there's like all within here for
weeks or something and that was crazy
those times are the worst yeah at least
handball one of them officer Timmons a
tech carry this for me yeah anyway
yeah that's all for next year next she's
a very hard next Joey you're putting my
face up alright so next question we have
here is from a but what would you say
the expected life span is of an r5 1600
and gtx 1070 a gigabyte high settings at
1080p okay well I'd say the r5 1600 is
the CPU there's six core 12 threats CPU
that should really be good for many many
years to come I can't see I can't even
imagine a future where at 12 threaded
CPU is being overwhelmed by games I mean
we're really struggling to kill the quad
course at this point yeah so yeah I'd be
shocked if it's within five years that
the arisin CPU is really really
struggling or being overwhelmed by games
but let's hope that it is sooner as for
the gtx 1070 well 1080p gaming that
thing is a beast that really you could
you'd be really looking like 144 Hertz
like which were earlier yeah so I think
the 1070 at least a couple of years at
least two years of and that's yeah at
high settings I think that was the
question wasn't it yeah high settings in
probably two years you could probably
get away with higher settings for a 1070
and then you'd sort of have to start
stepping it down to medium and whatever
but again there's so much that depends
on driver optimization doesn't it which
we've seen so it depends how
aggressively Nvidia pursues Pascal
driver optimization we've seen that
Maxwell has aged incredibly well I did a
video that was probably on the channel a
few days ago and I was a revisit of the
980ti and that has aged incredibly well
still hanging in there with the 1070
which is where it was on the seventies
launch so if an aged as well as Maxwell
then yeah I'd say at least two years
yeah I think one of the things that we
might be seeing happening in the next
couple years is that it might sound
ridiculous but like the eight gigabytes
of vram that's included might not be
enough because we're seeing a lot of
games of big big textures especially now
that you know the consoles have got a
lot of you know
memory in them at the moment yeah and so
you know there's a lot of these
developers that are pushing enormous 4k
texture packs with their games like I
think shadow of war can use all of the
1080 T eyes yes I yeah yeah I think it's
that I haven't actually explored that
one but there is one dam recently I came
out with a mega yeah so if anything it
might be that but like like you said I
think you'll still be good for another
couple years before we start seeing them
here really yeah I mean the vram buffer
thing textures probably arguably are one
of the most important things for visual
quality like if you yeah you walk up
close to a wall and the textures are
really bad then it's like yeah I mean I
think that's what Star Wars Battlefront
does really well the tension is in that
game a phenomenal so it'll still perform
well you get a higher frame rates if you
do just turn the things that are eating
up that VR and buff and that's the same
thing we saw with the fury acts the fury
excellence fogging vram before now just
gets smoked in so many games it's just
yeah it out equip but again if you turn
those memory hungry settings down then
the fury X will come to life so it
depends on what you're willing to
compromise on oh I say it to guys like
if you buy hardware now and you're still
expect you to be kicking some serious
backs fired in two years time they're
not you know but if you're willing to
compromise a little bit and yeah yeah
alright next question is from Rodrigo
gas akan when will you ever get a proper
knife for the unboxing boxes videos yes
Dave when are you gonna get something
actually cuts things what are you
talking about I'll cover the brand name
cuz what are you talking about I you've
been struggling recently with the boxes
maybe the guys have a point
this knife is pretty bad you need a
proper box cutter oh wait so um actually
that's what I'll I'll use a proper knife
when someone sends me once that's a my
way of scamming a free knife is for that
I'll actually have to start my pure box
so yeah I haven't got what you have a
customs were sending you knives so
something you can do I actually think
I've seen a few other youtubers not tech
youtubers but oh yeah get knives at they
unbox okay well yeah
customs are shot yeah see how they go
just test the boys out
okay the next question is from Kevin H
or H so the thing that always comes up
anyway are soft tubing it seems easier
but hard troops are much more
aesthetically pleasing indeed they are
is there anything I should be aware e of
before deciding to try a custom loop for
the first time or specific tips if I go
hard tubing well yeah that's a that's a
tricky one first of all liquid cooling
in general whether you do the I suppose
the soft tubing as much not talking
about difficulty here just price-wise
it's a lot cheaper I think or they're
both pretty pricey you really want you
to get a forget a big radiator and a
good pump and that it's yeah you're
looking at plenty of dollar so basically
yes what I'm getting at is liquid
cooling in general or custom stuff not
the all-in-one stuff if you think of
doing custom or liquid cooling have
plenty of money yeah it's it's really
expensive so basically work out all the
parts and how much you'll need and tack
on another 50 percent probably for a
first-timer cuz yeah it can be expensive
and of course you do run the risk of
having leaks which can damage components
the hard tubes stuff does look amazing
okay see here it looks pretty cool I've
done a few builds it depending on how
good you are with all that sort of stuff
like the bending of the tubes and that I
don't find it too difficult but I do a
lot of hands-on building type stuff and
I've done a lot of plumbing in that that
not saying that they're exactly the same
but not similar yeah both have pipes of
water in them so same thing it's
definitely a lot harder but the main
thing is it's just wildly impractical so
the I've got a couple of test systems
with soft tubing and you know you can
stick the block on you change the CPU
rip it off and you can they're pretty
durable I throw the block around stuff
changing CPUs I've never ever had a leak
the fittings that these days are really
good and yet they're just flexible you
can change your CPU you can change your
graphics card or whatever I mean if
there's a block attention the graphics
card at least you can still take it out
if there's a problem or something or
you're trying to diagnose something you
can take the graphics cut out at least
hang it out of the system with hard
pipes
you got no wriggle room so if you
wanted to change the CPU now you're
gonna drain the whole system actually
physically take the pipes out and take
it apart so it's a nightmare really in
that sense it's great for show and that
I don't know I mean my personal rigors
that Corp III when we built on the
channel and thankfully nothing wrong
with that so but yeah as someone that
uses my PC for gaming in a lot of it
really know if I bother with the hard PI
like a one-time thing you put your hard
pipes in yeah don't plan on upgrading
gonna have to build a whole yeah yeah
yeah and then you know if it is a gaming
system you have a couple of problems
that you gotta try and diagnose it's
just a nightmare because you can't take
components out to swap things in or
whatever so yeah probably went a bit
generic with my response for there but
yeah I would definitely go for softube
the first time sort of climate I as
yourself to custom liquid cooling that
way and then if you're very confident
with that and you know all the cons and
pros
the only real con is it looks cool the
pros are everything else then try the
hard tubes tough I think you said pros
and cons are in the wrong way compro pro
con whatever they know what I meant
alright a question here from sumit by
NOLA
Oh God give him the hard ones hi alright
what you like to do other than PC and
technical things so yeah interesting
question have to think about this run
for a little bit because most the stuff
I do is the PC technical things I think
I probably count gaming in that which is
something I do a lot outside of work
sort of stuff but blowing the line yeah
it's a bit of a blurred line there apart
from that you've probably seen the back
of some of my sets if you watch my video
I tend to build a lot of Lego that sort
of thing you know it's nice and relaxing
to do that I think gets gets my mind
away from work and I watch a fair bit of
sport as well so not too much playing it
because I'm just awful but watching on
TV and so I see that side of this okay I
guess I could answer it kind of twice
because there's quite a big age gap
between to myself so when I was your age
I would have struggled to answer as well
I played a favorite of sport certainly
more than I do now
what inline hockey okay so
okay yeah yeah yeah I really enjoyed
that that was awesome I'd still love to
play it but it was a bit brutal on the
body okay yeah when I was your age it
wasn't so bad but now you take a hit
like that and you've gone for a few
weeks if not longer I was into cars
massively when I was your age
so yeah young guy into cars so that's
where my money went but I cuz I do like
hands-on stuff I built my car for those
of you wondering I had a skyline listen
scarlet that was an important r33 and I
changed the turbo and everything on that
and tons of money and time and fun and
it was a track car so you should take
the track and stuff but ya did a lot of
that but now that I'm I'm older and
wiser I pretty much just messed around
on my house so I like building things
I've got all the power tools that there
can be to buy basically so yeah I've
done a lot of products around my house
I'm always building things and fixing
things not so much this year at the
YouTube channel that's kind of sucked up
my time but yeah I suppose I would be
doing I'd probably be a tradie
to be honest I just love building things
like yeah I've done a lot of projects
and it's pretty hard on the body but I
just enjoy doing it so yeah it's sort of
a grind as well I suppose Channel yep
all right that's my sorry I was gonna
say drumroll please that's my drumroll
last question here we go M SG w did I
say that right yeah I think you know
that it didn't get it around the wrong
way yeah what would you do this is an
interesting one if you had to build or
yeah if you have to build all the
systems so if you had to build an older
system like an AMD Athlon one what would
you do if you had to build so I'm
assuming he means if I you know your
only option
like 2017 was to and I'm not mocking
guys that can't afford a new hardware
but if you can't afford a new hardware
and you build an ambulance system
unsubscribe yeah I honestly think I'd
quit playing computer games I'd go
outside and try actually playing games
and
a good plan yeah not virtual reality the
other one yeah if I mean if you're on a
really tight budget it's kind of like
the AMD a PUD what was that the even got
the night was so terrible he was the a12
9800 yeah yeah which is essentially what
we're talking about here I'm assuming
he's not talking about an Athlon from
ten years ago I hope not because that
would be difficult to do anything with a
B if you're on a really tight budget buy
second-hand oh yeah again Brian from
check yes City does awesome secondhand
builds flight we're talking a hundred
dollar summer less great deals on stuff
or like country in Australia yeah
obscene whitelist like Ivybridge core i5
systems with a graphics card that will
play things like rocket League and quite
champions and always games with
reasonable settings like to achieve 50
to 100 dollars with monitor keyboard the
whole lawyer people just as soon as they
you know people who are always buying
new stuff just flog off their old stuff
for super cheap or at the time it's
really worth exploring that sort of yeah
so so like upgrade my PC please a lot of
the computers where guys were just
saying like my friend built a new
horizon system and he had this computer
it was like I was like core i7 and 920
or something like that like they're just
like he gave it to me about 12 gig of
ram GTX some of my 9 70s and stuff like
that's a good gaming systems a great get
for free yeah so this there's stuff out
there like yeah just like you say though
when people have done with a computer
they just want to get rid of it take
this away it's taking up yeah space so
yeah look at secondhand there our cool
deal see I don't even then if you buy
like Brian basically goes and buys a
heap of completely junk systems for five
dollars that don't work and then you
might get a power supply from that one
the motherboard might be good than that
one to get a CPU from there and you
piece it all together so that's a cool
way of getting a cheap system so yeah we
went about answering that rather short
question that probably could have been
answered in the first second and what we
said well that about wraps up all the
questions I think we have time for
because this video has probably been
pretty lengthy as it is but yeah we
through a lot of questions there were a
lot more we didn't but thank you guys
for asking all the questions and Tim and
I'll probably do these on a regular
basis now I think at least do it
probably a monthly thing yeah yeah
monthly thing now I hope you enjoy it
any other be more to come
and we'll see you next time
