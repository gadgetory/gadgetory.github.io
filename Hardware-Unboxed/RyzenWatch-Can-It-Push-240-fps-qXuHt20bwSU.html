please move behind the body up enemy
welcome back to how our own box for my
risin 5 1,600 build inside the very
pretty cooler master master case maker
Phi of T or should I say ver well once
pretty pastor 5c anyways many of you
know I decided to customize this build
beyond the typical component selection
by taking to the case with a few spray
cans the idea here was to make the case
rise and themed because we are using a
risin processor and when I started this
which is quite a few weeks before
Computex horizon was still quite a hot
topic and well it is now really anyway
the idea was to go with black which the
case was mostly black so I didn't have
to do any work there but to replace the
red highlights with orange typically AMD
builds our red and black that was rising
being more orange and the red I thought
change that to orange and add a bit of
gray as well because it's sort of gray
and orange is the rise and color or the
color of the box is what the box down
here so as you can see the gray I went
with is a bit too light to match the box
the boxes of darker kind of gray but
anyway not to worry a few of you still
said it looked really good you liked it
and it made it look like an overwatch
build so I thought what the hey let's
call it rise and watch pre creative I
know I'm not great coming up names but
anyway that's what it is rise and watch
and for this video I thought I'd do a
little bit of everything hopefully I
won't drag it out for too long but I
thought I'd show the build coming
together all the components that I've
painted all that sort of stuff going
into the bills and then a bit of
hands-on a gaming action so it should be
a lot of fun so this in your face
builder have not just the amazing maker
5t case in Rison 5-6 to have a processor
but also the asrock fatality X 370
gaming k4 and 32 gigabytes of ddr4
memory cooler masters also sent along an
army of their master fan pro 120 air
Balance age
fans they're impressive looking master
liquid Pro 280 and they're fully modular
v-series 650 watt power supply in
addition to all that Coolermaster also
provided their fancy new RGB LED
controller this is a digital controller
which interfaces with some slick
windows-based software and it allows
users to quickly and conveniently apply
countless colors and effects I played
around this a bit and I was really
impressed with how well polished the
software was but in the end I went with
a fairly ordinary looking static orange
color but I think for this build of
complements it perfectly but it's nice
to know that you can change the look of
the build really quickly at the click of
a button for the graphics card I decided
to stick with AMD for this one I went
with the very impressive Oris rx 580 xtr
8 gigabyte you can say it looks
impressive and the performance is really
good for the price then for the storage
we have the Samsung 850 Evo 500 gigabyte
and Seagate's 2 terabyte fire cruder so
the plan is to put it all together and
hopefully we end up with a really
cool-looking gaming PC capable of
tackling all the latest titles we also
recently reviewed the AOC AG 2 v 1 FZ
240 Hertz gaming monitor and since this
is a risin to flash overwatch built I
thought it would be cool to see what
kind of settings are needed to maintain
240 FPS in that title so in order to
find out we need to finish putting this
thing together so let's do that and then
reconvene for some gameplay afterwards
you
it's
and
so the monitor being used for it's a
massive 240 Hertz refresh rate and I
found for the most part using the high
quality preset the system was able to
maintain over 200 FPS and overwatch
often well over 200 fps in fact the
gameplay was incredibly smooth certainly
smoother than anything I've experienced
previously the rosen 5 1600 was
overclocked to fog you can hurt this
test so make note of that that said
though the RX 580 was left stuff though
to be fair there really isn't much OC
were injured anyway but yeah the
performance was incredible and while I
don't really play overwatch I have to
admit I do really like the game I sadly
just don't have much time to play games
these days I found it quite hard to pull
myself away from this setup it was a
heap of fun and just such an amazing
experience jumping over the counter
strike global offensive another game I
don't really play or have much
experience with but the Regent worked
very well I didn't need to be a csgo
expert to tell that much again using the
high quality settings the frame rate
above 200 FPS for the most part and as
you might expect provided a very smooth
experience so well riser might not be
the absolute best solution for high
refresh rate gaming it can certainly get
the job done and as we've just seen it's
very suitable for these eSports titles
we're not playing games the r5 1600 has
a natural advantage over those high quad
core parts and it's much better for
rendering and encoding work well there
you have it
I hope you guys enjoyed the ride and
watch build the big thanks to
Coolermaster for providing so much of
their hardware to make it possible I
thought a great way to in this video
would be to announce that I will be
giving away the horizon watch rig on the
channel very soon right now I am working
with a few other youtubers to organize a
multi-system giveaway we're still
ironing out the details but expect more
information soon and of course if you
