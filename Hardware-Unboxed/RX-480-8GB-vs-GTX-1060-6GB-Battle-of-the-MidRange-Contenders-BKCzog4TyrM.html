finally benchmark the Ark's 488 gigabyte
and gtx 1066 qi board partner cards
head-to-head picking up where the
previous msi RX 474 gig vs. msi gtx 1063
gear graphics card left off we now have
the battle of the serious mid-range
contenders for those of you paying
attention you'll know the RX 488
gigabyte card features an MSRP of 240
dollars on the gtx 1066 GUI packs are
slightly more pricey $250 MSRP sadly to
the dismay of would-be buyers neither
are readily available the suggested
manufacturer prices both of the RX 418
gtx 1060 gaming ex models are priced at
290 u.s. at present and as aziz are
paying around $450 ever site does offer
cheaper gtx 1060 models such as the 6
GTO c4 260 but for the sake of this
comparison we're trying to compare the
cards as evenly matched as possible so
with two very similarly priced gaming X
cards on hand let's get to the
benchmarks and see what's what kickstart
in the benchmarks we're going to look at
half a dozen low-level api titles using
DirectX 12 and Vulcan first up we have
total war Warhammer supporting DX 12 and
here the 480 enjoyed a for FPS advantage
over the 1060 making in videos offering
7% slower here hit man's a game is
strongly favored AMD hardware near the
DirectX 11 or DirectX 12 modes so
low-level API support certainly isn't
the winning factor here still the 480
was 5 FPS faster making the 10 69
percent slower ashes of the singularity
is one of the best examples of a DirectX
12 game as it was built from the ground
up to take advantage of this modern API
interestingly both the 480 and 1060
delivered the same 48 FPS average here
when using the extreme quality preset
Deus Ex mankind divided has had DirectX
12 support patched in so take from that
what you will it certainly isn't a
native DirectX 12 title regardless the
480 s massive win in this title doesn't
come from the DX 12 support as it also
crushes the 1060 when using dx11
mankind divided is an AMD supported
title and as such has been designed to
suit the red team's Hardware nicely rise
of the Tomb Raider
is another game defeated patched in
DirectX 12 support however this is an
Nvidia supporter title and surprise
surprise the green team comes out well
on top here the 10 60 average 60 4 FPS
to the 480 s 58 FPS making the 10 60
some 10% faster of the low-level API
games tested Doom is the only one that
genuinely favors AMD due to the use of
the low-level API whereas the 10 60
performs much the same using OpenGL and
Vulcan the 480 comes from nowhere with
OpenGL to dominate using Vulcan that
said it's worth keeping in mind that
although the 1060 was 9 percent slower
did average over 100 FPS of 1440p with
the game virtually maxed out so that was
very playable performance - ok so now
it's time to check out the DirectX 11
titles which in 2016 still dominate the
market the recently released Mirror's
Edge catalyst is a perfect example of
this here the 1060 was slightly faster
providing 4 FPS more on average which
was 9% performance advantage The Witcher
3 Wild Hunt sees the 1060 and 480
deliver the same 54 FPS result at 1440p
interestingly neither a much faster than
the cheaper 3q by 1060 here just 4 FPS
on average separates them AMD struggles
with the minimum frame rate in Star Wars
Battlefront and again we see that here
with the 480 the 1060 was 7% faster on
average was 17% faster when comparing
the minimum frame rate Tom Clancy's the
division is another DirectX 11 title
where the 480 and 1060 come out
neck-and-neck this time with 48 FPS each
interestingly the 480 came out on top
when testing with Batman Arkham Knight
as the 1060 was 5 percent slower Middle
Earth shadow of Mordor provided
competitive results here the 1060 was
just 3 FPS faster handing it a 5 percent
performance advantage something we found
interesting in our 470 versus 10 63
gigabyte comparison was the fact that
although the 470 was crushed by the 1060
in overwatch when comparing the average
frame rate the minimums were exactly the
same well once again we find a similar
story when comparing the 1066 ki baatain
480 the 1060 was 12% faster when
comparing the average frame rate but
just 2% faster when comparing the
minimum making in videos when here far
less substantial performance was again
very even in Far Cry primal
1060 was just 4% faster making for a
very even fight the 1060 was 7% faster
and Assassin's Creed syndicate though
this did translate to just 4 FPS more on
average so another close battle then
Grand Theft Auto 5 weighed heavily in
the 3d by 10 60s favored over the 417
and we find it again favors in video
when comparing the six key by 1060 and
480 here the 1060 was 11% faster
delivering 83 fps compared to 75 FPS for
the 480 due to popular demand I've made
sure to include ARMA 3 though it has to
be said the game provides less than
competitive results here the 1060 was
50% faster than the 480 this certainly
isn't the norm and you won't see any
other results quite like this I'm not
sure why the AMD GPUs suck so bad in
this title it's actually a real shame
the RX 480 doesn't fare particularly
well in Crysis 3 delivering just a few
extra frames over the 470 this meant it
wasn't just slower than the 60 by 1060
but also the 3 gigabyte model as well
another game where the three gigabyte
1060 outpaced the 480 was dirt rally
here the 6 gig 1060 enjoyed a 14%
performance advantage with 75 FPS a
postive is 66 fps
yet another title where the three gig
1060 trumped the 4 idea was fallout 4
here the 6 gig 1060 was 12% faster
averaging 66 FPS while the 480 averaged
59 fps like Star Wars Battlefront we
find that although the 480 is much
slower in Just Cause 3 when comparing
the average frame rate it's a good bit
slower when looking at the minimums
finally we have Mad Max and like dirt
rally we find strong frame rates from
both the 480 and 1060 though NVIDIA does
have a clear performance advantage in
this title in fact whereas the 1060 was
14% faster in dirt rally it's 20% faster
here power consumption for the MSI 1066
gig in our X 480 a key gaming X cards is
in line with what we saw from the 1063
gig and our X 470 gaming X bottles the
slightly higher n6q 1060 and our X 480
consumes slightly more power and of
course this meant the 1060 was quite a
bit more efficient the margins were much
the same when testing with Far Cry
primal Deus Ex mankind divided and dirt
rally okay so before wrapping things up
let's take a quick look at a few
performance breakdowns starting with the
director
eleven titles we have results from 16
games here the six gigabyte gtx 1060 was
an average temperature faster than the
RX 480
not a huge marginal although it did
swing in videos favor the cards did at
times trade blows during the game with
the RX fried he came out on top was
Batman Arkham Knight though if we tested
hitman a Deus Ex mankind divided using
DirectX 11 and II would have one here as
well still there are a few quality
titles such as The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt
and Tom Clancy's the division where both
GPUs provided the same performance
moving to the low-level API games we
find very different results here the
1060 was an average 5 percent slower
though you have to really look at these
results to get a clearer picture of
what's going on here as I said earlier
ashes that the singularity is the best
quality DirectX 12 game of the bunch and
here the 480 in 1060 actually delivered
exactly the same performance then we
have doom where the 1060 was nice and
slower though that results also a little
misleading for a few reasons firstly the
1060 performs just as well use in Vulcan
as it does OpenGL so you could easily
argue that the maximum efficiency is
being achieved without the need for
low-level API also worth noting here is
the dismal OpenGL performance of the
Radeon graphics card making the Vulcan
performance look even more impressive
still there's no denying the doom with
its Vulcan support is a great game for
showcasing AMD's hardware and the
results are truly impressive it's also
worth noting that although the 1060 was
9% slower in this title it still provide
a highly playable performance and the
difference certainly won't be noticeable
when gaming the 1060 loses in total war
Warhammer and although this is an AMD
supporter title I feel this is a fair
win the big hits from video are seen in
hitman and Deus Ex mankind divided
though as I pointed out earlier claiming
these victories down to the DirectX 12
support isn't correct the rx 40 will
trounce the 1060 in both these titles
even when using DirectX 11 the low-level
API support has nothing to do with the
wind scene here
likewise rise of the Tomb Raider is a
game that favors in video Hardware
regardless of the API used another
DirectX 12 title that it didn't have
time to add to this video but have
started testing is forza horizon 3 so
far from what I've seen the RX 480 and
gtx 1060 are very evenly matched in this
title with neither having a notice
performance advantage so as I've said
time and time again the jury is still
out for me on which GPU will provide the
best performance going forward I still
suspect that we'll see a fair share of
DirectX 12 titles that favoring video
Hardware with a good number that also
favor AMD hardware hopefully they'll
also be plenty like for in ashes of the
singularity that run great on either
manufacturers hardware the low-level API
sample games featured in this review I
feel a quite skewed and don't paint an
accurate picture of what's to come the
results from games such as hitman Deus
Ex mankind dividing rise of the Tomb
Raider really need to be taken with a
grain of salt
given the developer bias if you're after
the fastest GPU for playing games right
now the GTX 1060 does come out on top as
of a 6% faster on average when tallying
up all 22 games tested the 1060 is also
significantly more efficient allowing to
run cooler and quieter still the AR X
480 does have plenty of strengths and
without question the future looks
brighter right now this makes choosing
between the two extremely difficult
frankly I would pick based on the games
I intend to play and of course whichever
comes at the best price right now the
gaming X models seem to retail you for
roughly the same price in the US and
Australia but pricing could vary in
other regions the hope is if I've done
my job correctly that you should now
have all the facts and figures allowing
you to make an informed purchase which
one are you going to go with let me know
in the comments I'm your host Matt as
always and I'll see you guys next time
