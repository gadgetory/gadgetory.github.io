please on last week's episode we had
five AMD APU based systems in need of
various upgrades and you the viewers
voted Vince's potato some are the most
worthy of receiving the proposed
upgrades coming Vince's weight is a
brand new horizon 3 1200 CPU the asrock
be 350 motherboard 8 gigabytes of ddr4
memory a geforce gtx 1060 graphics card
and the EVGA 500 b1 power supply so
basically in your computer the good news
for our 4 runners-up they will be
receiving a Rainbow six siege game coach
from Ubisoft big thanks to Ubisoft for
supporting the series in providing our
contestants with free games once Vince
gets the new hardware it has it all
installed into his rig we'll get some
updated photos and we'll show them to
you guys as a special feature at the
start of next season also don't forget
to comment and vote each week as that
will place you in the running to win
some cool prizes and those will be
global giveaways last week Iago Paris
from Brazil won a Verizon v 1600
processor this week we have another cool
prize and I'll announce that later in
the video for now we have 5 pcs all
Anita various upgrades so let's go check
them out alright diving until we have
Andrews PC which is dubbed jus
retirement makes sense the 11 year old q
6600 has seen better days that GeForce
GTX 1060 is probably not really pulling
its weight either
anyway the system in its current form or
there abouts well it's built five years
ago from secondhand parts with the
exception of the graphics card the
lovely and very retro coolermaster wave
master has seen three builds now it's
started life with an Athlon 3500 then an
Athlon 64 x2 4200 plus then an Athlon 64
x2 5400 before going blue with the Q
6600 Andrew now uses the system for
image and video editing but of course
enjoys the odd games such as R factor to
Borderlands and rollercoaster tycoon
I'm sure it also like to enjoy some new
or more demanding games as well could he
actually play them the only requirement
here being that we do keep the wave
master case and honestly I wouldn't dare
a place such an old beauty what I will
do though is replaced that crusty old
LGA 775 platform we have at most 380
pounds to play with
so we will be stretching the budget to
the max on this one the best option
right now for Andrews needs would be the
risin 5 1600 on the Isuzu Prime be 350
plus with a gigabytes of ddr4 I'd love
to upgrade the graphics card as well but
rather than opt for a lower end verizon
CP I feel like going all-in on the r5
1600 will pay off for that image and
particularly video editing should andrew
win you can always upgrade to something
like a GTX 1060 in the future and
that'll set him up nicely for gaming
it's my boy blue
actually it's Blue Lightning opportunity
mist there anyway owner Mitchell is a
fellow Aussie and despite rocking an old
Core 2 quad rig it's actually quite new
to him I think of it or not this gaming
rig was built this year of course it was
done so using second-hand components
probably very second-hand and they were
purchased on eBay and a gum tree
this is Mitchell's first ever PC build
so a big congratulations to him I just
hope he didn't spend too much of the
components anyway right now he is
playing rust rage and minecraft what
he's looking for in an upgrade is higher
frame rates and faster boot times aren't
we all he would they like to stick with
a black and blue theme for the build I
like that he's quite particular about
the small details as this is purely a
gaming system I propose we go about
things a little differently for this one
I suggest we opt for the Intel Core i5
8400 it's an absolute beast of a gaming
CPU and with 6 cores that will look
after Mitchell for a long time here in
Australia there's seuss prime Z 370 P is
a cost-effective option and it meets our
color scheme requirements quite nicely
on that we'll also throw 8 gigabytes of
ddr4 memory the rest ends on Mitchell
should he be able to save up for
something like a GTX 1060 and maybe an
SSD this would be an absolutely rockin
gaming system the platform could even
see a number of GP upgrades in the
future as well so there's plenty of room
to grow and expand with this platform
upgrade
David built his Core 2 quad system back
in 2009 to play trackmania unite and
call of duty
back then it sported a GeForce 8800 GTS
which was replaced by a GTX 260 and then
a GTX 560 and now it has a gtx 770 while
still an avid gamer david has shifted
his focus towards content creation and
video editing so he spends a lot of time
in premiere in Photoshop apparently
though photoshop crashes quite regularly
it's making getting any real work done
very difficult then when David's done
trying to get some actual work done he
does like to play fallout 4 Skyrim and
oxygen not included the cable management
on this one is a complete disaster
and David blames the antec 900 case
there's simply nowhere to put all the
cables he says the priority though for
the $500 u.s. budget will be to improve
the Photoshop and premiere performance
rather than his cable management so here
we have another uk-based contestant in
need of horizon 5 1600 build and again
I'll go with you if Sue's Prime be 350
plus with 8 gigabytes of memory the GTX
770 will now perform much better certain
itself will really boost the gaming
experience while the r5 16 her will
breeze through productivity workloads
with ease
the next system was built by Bruce back
in 2008 for the sole purpose of
streaming YouTube videos and of course
playing games after a horrible
experience with an insanely expensive
pre-built from alien where Bruce decided
to build his own unfortunately after
spending big on his custom-built rig the
one that you see here Bruce did fall on
tough times and has been struggling ever
since originally the system came with a
visiontek radeon HD 3870 x2 but that
card ended up failing and oddly I had
the exact same maker model and mine died
as well anyway a good friend came to the
rescue when he upgraded he entered Bruce
his r9 390 so that was a seriously good
score arma 3 plays extremely well on the
new Intel Core i5 8400 so this is what I
propose we go for along with the MSI z3
70 a pro with a gigabytes of ddr4 memory
then to really get his pc up to speed
let's drop in crucial MX 300 275
gigabyte SSD should burst be lucky
enough to win he'll think he's just
received some kind of
technology francis was gifted this
computer seven years ago by his
girlfriend's father at the time it
couldn't have been more than three years
old and with a $1000 qx60 850 out of the
hood that's a seriously nice pickup
since then he has replaced the original
GTX 650 to eye with the GTX 1050 Ti and
he's also purchased on the site a
Corsair case and cooler master cooler as
he plans to slowly upgrade every part in
the system this is though against the
approval of his girlfriend I'm told so
that's a bit awkward maybe she's hoping
dad will come through with a core i5 59
60 X rig or something like that anyway
the new corsair and Coolermaster bits
have been purchased so hopefully Francis
isn't currently single that'd be a shame
if he missed out on that future upgrade
path right now he's only using the
system for gaming he does play d3 which
I have to assume is Diablo 3 and given
that the other game is World of Warcraft
I'd say I'm probably right
however the hope is with the upgrade to
get the system up to speed so he can
play games such as overwatch and pub G
apparently load times are a major issue
for the games he's currently playing in
those WD green drives aren't the
snappiest choice for a boot drive so for
this one let's go with the arisin v 1400
on msi is really nice be 350 tomahawk
with a gigabytes of ddr4 memory then I
propose we demote the WD green hard
drive to secondary storage status by
dropping in the crucial MX 300 275
gigabyte SSD and that will see us use
every last dollar in our budget with
this upgrade though pub G and overwatch
won't be an issue all right guys there's
five Intel relics all in need of various
upgrades it's now your job to let us
know which one you think is the most

upgrade package to cast your vote follow
