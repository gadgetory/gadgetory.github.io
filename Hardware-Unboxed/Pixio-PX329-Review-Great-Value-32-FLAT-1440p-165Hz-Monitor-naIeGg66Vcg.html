super excited to review the monitor I
have with me for testing today the pick
0px 329 because I think it's a really
good value product I'm just gonna say it
right at the top this monitor is
available for just 450 US dollars and
for what it brings to the table that's a
very tasty price point so the PX 329 is
the first monitor I've reviewed from
Pixy oh another one of those budget
brands like biotech that's I guess you
have to say less commonly known than
your LG's Samsung's D'Souza's and so on
the PX 329 is also the first monitor
I've tested that is using a new for 2018
panel from a you Optronics the first to
offer a high refresh 1440p experience at
32 inches without a curve we've had 32
inch 1440p 144 hertz displays for a
little while now but all available
models were using an 1800 our curved
panel so if you wanted this great
combination of refresh rate and
resolution and size you were stuck with
only curved options I personally prefer
flat 16:9 displays and I suspect many of
you do as well so it's great that a you
Optronics have developed a flat
alternative that's being used in the PX
329 not only is this a 32 inch 1440p 144
hertz display it's actually capable of
pushing its refresh up to 165 Hertz
matching what is possible with 27-inch
1440p high refresh monitors it uses VA
technology and it supports free sync to
of course with low framerate
compensation and at four hundred and
fifty dollars it's the cheapest display
and I guess one of the only displays
with these specs as well as being price
competitive with the curved options but
anyone can read off the spec sheet let's
take a look at whether the px 329 is
actually any good starting with the
design I think was only a couple of
weeks ago I was calling a different
monitor the best monitor designer looked
at in a while but I think this pixel
monitor might take that crown the px 329
is basic as you'd expect from a price
sensitive display but it looks fantastic
and takes most of the boxes I look for
in monitor design the front is simple
and leaves all the talking to the panel
itself the bezels of reasonably slim
around all four edges and the
bottom edge doesn't dominate for once
there's practically no gamer design
elements and on the front there isn't
even pic co-branding with the simple px
329 mojo seen in the bottom left corner
the stand is also simple and elegant
crafted from what appears to be entire
pieces of metal with a powder-coated
finish the only complaint I have about
the stand and the monitor as a whole I
guess is they lack of highs
adjustability the stand only supports
tilt adjust that said you can visa
mounted and picture also offers a
different stand you can purchase
separately that adds height to swivel
and pivot adjustments the great news for
those that want to mount this monitor is
it's very slim and reasonably light for
a 32 inch display the entire upper
section of the rears basically just
panel and protective plastic with their
components and other electronics all
placed within a section towards the
bottom similar to many modern TVs inputs
we get two HDMI 2.0 ports two
DisplayPort 1.2 ports and an audio
output jack to pass through either HDMI
or DP audio to an external speaker the
OSD is controlled through a directional
toggle which is great to see although
navigation is a little unconventional
though most typical features are
included at this point of the review it
is crucial to talk about the refresh
rate of the monitor the px 329 does push
up to 165 Hertz which previously I guess
was restricted to a small collection of
1440p g-sync monitors aside from this
one MSI model so you might be thinking
great the PX 329 is another freesync
monitor that features a 165 Hertz
refresh rate unfortunately there is a
catch the maximum refresh rate supported
in this monitors freesync mode is a
hundred and forty-four Hertz you
actually have to disable free sync to
get the monitor running at 165 Hertz so
this presents an interesting choice
between adaptive sync &amp;amp; top-end refresh
rate obviously for NVIDIA GPU I lose the
choice is simple you can't use free sync
anyway so set the monitor to 165 Hertz
but for AMD GPU on his own recommend
keeping free sync enabled and capping
the monitor to 144 Hertz is honestly the
difference between 144 and 165 Hertz
isn't that large while having free sync
enabled can make a large difference to
the playing experience let's move on to
see how this power performs because
there's
a few interesting things to note here
firstly the panel isn't that bright I
recorded a maximum brightness of just
223 nits which admittedly is brighter
than I would normally use but still
falls well short of peak series 300 net
claim if you need a monitor for a bright
environment 223 nits might not cut it I
also found the contrast ratio pretty
interesting this is a V a panel with the
rated 3000 to 1 contrast ratio however
in my testing the actual ratio hovered
between 1700 and 1750 to 1 which is
obviously well short of what I guess
you'd expect for a V a display this is
actually the first V a display I
reviewed that fell below a 2020 on trust
ratio and when I asked Pixar if this was
normal for the px 329 they gave me no
indication it was a defect or other
issues so I assume this is within normal
tolerances for the panel with that said
I don't think the contrast ratio is a
major issue either consuming the PX 329
still performs ahead of IPS and TN
panels in this regard with a superior
black level it's not as good as I'd have
liked to see and not up there with the
best VA panels but at least there was no
noticeable backlight bleed issues or
random glow let's look at out of the box
color performance and it's no surprise
that the px 3 of 29 isn't that amazing
in this regard considering pics Europe
well they make no claims about color
accuracy the CCT curve looks a little
strange with blue intensity dropping
right away at a hundred percent white
but gamma is decent however on average
Delta e of four point eight zero with
most of the upper intensity white it's
pushing above a Delta e of 6.0 isn't
great this mediocre performance
continues looking at saturation swoops
as well as our color checker test both
of which produce average deltas around
four point five suffice to say this
isn't a well calibrated panel out of the
box however it's easy to write off a
display from its out-of-the-box
performance the key indicator I look for
is good performance after making a few
tweaks using the on-screen settings as
we're not messing around with full
calibration or software profiles just
yet plus it's the best indicator of what
a typical user can achieve with this
despite just use the settings you see
here and you should get similar
performance to what you're about to see
without the need for any expensive
calibration tools and as you can see
here the pH 329 is very
receptive to OSD tweaks particularly
thanks to its adjustable saturation
slider I actually think there's a few
weird setting choices by default
including saturation set to 60 and too
low contrast though I should note that
increasing the contrast slider only
pushes up overall contrast to around
1800 to one so not a major improvement
there anyway with a few tweaks we're
getting a much better CCT curve and a
far better grayscale delta-e average of
1.37 with every value below 2.0 I
consider this a success for OSD
calibration is honestly this should be
fine for most creators saturation
delta-e average improves to one point
for one with a few loose values but
still a great result while color
checkers average of one point to one is
also excellent
as far as OSD calibration results go
this is the best result I've seen
outside of monitors that specify a
certain level of color accuracy usually
those are professional-grade displays
and this is all achievable really by
anyone that purchases this monitor which
is an excellent result then of course
you can tighten up performance even
further through a full calibration pass
using spectra Cal's Cal man 5 not a lot
to see here fairly standard results
outside of 100% blue though srgb
coverage remains north of 96% uniformity
is one area where this new flat panel
brings an advantage over the older curve
models the px 329 performs well in this
regard though the outer right side of
the display does deviate noticeably from
the center that said this result is
noticeably better than curve displays in
particularly the competing 32 inch curve
variant of this panel used in the
vo-tech G and 32 L d which as you can
see here has a serious y-axis uniformity
issue in terms of power consumption this
flat panel does consume more power when
calibrated compared to the curved 32
inch variant at 74 watts compared to 60
watts with the G own 32 LD final thing
to discuss are the response times the px
329 reports it with an average greater
gray response time of 8.2 seven
milliseconds which is typical for a VA
panel and actually quite close to the
eight point one seven milliseconds are
recorded for the similar but curved
variant the difference to note here is
rise times and fall times are much more
similar with the flat model whereas the
curve model has rise times almost twice
as slow as fall times
still around that eight millisecond mark
is typical for VA pick Co does claim
five millisecond response times which
seems more in line with some of the
faster transitions rather than an
average I should also mention I'm using
the H overdrive setting which is the
highest available however as tends to be
the case with high refresh va displays
the average transition time is actually
longer than the refresh window in the
case of this 165 Hertz display the image
is updated every six point zero six
milliseconds except transitions take on
average eight point two seven
milliseconds so it's not really a true
165 Hertz display instead ghosting and
smearing of the limiting factors and
that prevents the panel from providing a
true 165 Hertz or even 144 Hertz
experience in practice this is more like
a 120 Hertz panel in how it performs
though again this is no different to the
curve variance the good news is the px
329 exhibits elite input latency of just
a few milliseconds in fact the panel is
so fast to respond I had to adjust the
normalization factor for our
measurements because it was faster than
any other display it actually tested up
until this point and of course I made
sure to calibrate this result against
several other monitors to ensure I was
really seeing this sort of performance
also it's worth mentioning that enabling
free sync had no real impact to input
latency all tests were conducted using
the monitors 165 Hertz mode which
disables free sync about switching
precinct on and capping the Refresh to
144 Hertz didn't affect this result in
any meaningful way so all things
considered I'm pretty easily recommend
the pick 0px 329 short it's not perfect
there are a few issues brightness and
contrast ratio are low for a VA panel
typical VA response times mean it's not
really a 165 Hertz display and then
there is that free sync refresh rate
oddity but when you look at the field of
32-inch 1440 pay high refresh monitors
the pay co 329 is going to give you the
best bang for your buck for as low as
440 u.s. dollars through a new wake the
PX 329 is the cheapest monitor with this
panel inside though admittedly there
aren't many options on the market right
now there should be a few more coming
soon but crucially it's only about forty
to fifty dollars more expensive than the
cheapest curved equivalents personally
I'd spend the extra cash just to get a
flat screen anyway rather
than curves but that price increase is
also justified due to the flat-panel
superior uniformity and the PX 329
excellent color results from just a few
small tweaks so pic Co may not be the
most well known brand out there but
they're getting on the front foot
through utilizing brand new panels and
producing excellent budget monitors this
is one I'm pretty easily recommend I
don't think buyers will be disappointed
with their purchase for just four
hundred and fifty dollars plus I'm
really diggin the 32 inch size at the
moment that's it for this one if you're
