I'm your host Matt and today we're
taking a quick look at the upcoming
gigabyte 4k 83 mechanical keyboard last
year I stumbled upon what has become one
of my favorite mechanical keyboards the
gigabyte AVR osmium using cherry MX red
switches it has a nice feel and I really
like the full-size detachable wrist rest
LED backlighting volume control wheel
and the USB 3 pass-through the only
negative aspect of the IV osmium is the
price and although 130 US still makes it
a great Buy
not everyone will be comfortable
spending that much on the keyboard this
is where gigabytes latest mechanical
keyboard the force k-8 III comes into
its own the force K 83 is yet to go on
sale but I'm told it should retail for
around 65 u.s. so half that of the ivy
osmium despite the huge reduction in
price the force kd3 still comes with
Cherry MX switches with the choice of
either blue or red and n key rollover is
also supported the build quality of the
force K 83 is every bit as good as it
was on the much more expensive Ivy
osmium that make no mistake this is a
very minimalistic product throughout any
dedicated macro multimedia keys and
because the force K d3 isn't
programmable users can't create their
own macro keys the Foss K industry is
intended to be a minimalist product with
two reasons first and foremost gigabyte
wanted to create the most affordable
mechanical keyboard possible using
Cherry MX switches as a result the force
K t3 is also very compact measuring just
438 millimeters long 131 millimeters
deep and 40 millimeters deep which is
about as small as you can make a
keyboard without removing the numpad
despite its small size the force K 83 is
still quite weighty at 1.1 kilograms and
this is down to the build quality the
force K 83 is a very solid and durable
keyboard
it features an island style key switch
design which can shield the keyboard
from drop crumbs or accidental spills
that could damage the circuit board this
design also means that any dust or
liquid can be easily removed
gigabyte has also laser-etched the key
caps to ensure the lettering on the keys
won't be easily worn out over time the
only non-standard key on the force ka d3
is a Windows lock key which is in place
of the right Windows key there is also a
function key next to the windows lock
key which when held allows the user to
access the secondary function of the F
keys essentially turning them into
multimedia keys underneath the Faust K
t3 is again very basic there are two
rubber pads at the front and a pair of
small phony feet at the back the USB to
cable measures 1.8 meters long and isn't
braided and of course around the added
connectivity options on the forced Kate
III such as USB pass-through there
really weren't nice surprises when using
the force K 83 it feels much like any
other cherry MX red keyboard with what I
consider to be standing key caps
although the KD 3 doesn't come with a
wrist rest I didn't find as
uncomfortable as other keyboards with a
similar design the KD 3 appears a bit
slimmer at the frame which gives a more
natural feel though if I were to use
this keyboard daily I'd want some sort
of wrist support the fourth KD 3 is as
basic as a mechanical keyboard can get
that we can't really foggy good buy it
for their lack of features given the $65
price tag making it one of the cheapest
Cherry MX boards available gigabyte is
also offering a two-year warranty
whereas many others such as rock out and
two-story for example only back their
keyboards is a one-year warranty
gigabyte states that the fourth K t3
works with Windows XP Vista Windows 7
and Windows 8 there's no mention of
Windows 10 although we know it works is
this was the operating system used for
testing realistically the kd3 should
work with any device or operating system
where a USB port is available as there
isn't any software required overall the
force K distri is a great quality budget
mechanical keyboard that would have been
perfect with the cheap plastic wrist
rest like the one Logitech tears with
the g7 10 plus please let us know what
you think about the gigabyte force K 83
