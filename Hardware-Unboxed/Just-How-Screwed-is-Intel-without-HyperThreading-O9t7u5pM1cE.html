are exploring the impact disabling
hyper-threading has on Intel processors
and obviously we'll be doing this on
models that actually support hyper
threading now I've done this in the past
and I've done it because it's an
interesting test and that's partly why
I'm remaking this video however another
motivator is the fact that Intel's
latest security vulnerability actually
impacts hyper-threading Tim's already
talked about zombie load and similar
micro architectural data sampling
vulnerabilities that affect Intel
processors in his news corner segment so
I'm not going to go over it in too much
detail basically there are four MDS
attacks that affect Intel processors are
the most serious of which has been named
a zombie load and is quickly for those
of you wondering AMD processors are not
impacted at all so none of the four
variants are a threat to those using AMD
CPUs so yeah that is a relief for AMD I
would imagine and especially those using
their processors as for Intel users the
only way to mitigate or at least
minimize these vulnerabilities short
term is to disable simultaneous
multi-threading or as Intel brands at
hyper threading as it stands Microsoft
is pushing out OS level updates to
address the for MDS vulnerabilities and
you'll get those with this month's 19:03
update however this doesn't mitigate the
problem entirely for that we need new
motherboard BIOS updates and apparently
Intel has released the updated microcode
to motherboard partners but so far no
new biased revisions have been released
to the public or at least at the time of
making this video so at this point I'm I
can't test the real impact these updates
will have for Intel processors however I
believe we can test a worst case
scenario by disabling hyper threading
and for older platforms that may not get
updated this might end up being the only
solution so I've grabbed the core i7 87
okay along with the 77 or okay and I've
tested them with a battery of gaming
applications with and without hyper
threading enabled I didn't bother
testing the core I $9.99 hundred K given
that it is an eight core part so the
missing threads won't really be an issue
here particularly for gaming performance
though there will still be a negative
impact on application performance and
that really should fall in line with
what we said from the 8700 K and 7700 K
if I was afforded a bit more
I'm about to fly out for Computex and
the testing for this video already took
up a few days but given more time I
would have liked to have test some
dual-core hyper threading enabled CPUs
as well as I suspected the impact there
will be rather brutal but I do have some
old data that we can fall back on and
have a look at later in the video anyway
getting on with it all testing has been
conducted this week using the Windows 10
build 1903 the Intel processors and we
tested with ddr4 3200 memory and the
GeForce r-tx 28 ETI has been used to
reduce GPU bottlenecks though the gaming
benchmarks do take place at both Teddy P
and 1440p but before we get to the game
benchmarks let's start with some
application testing okay so first we
have some Cinebench our twenty results
and looking at the core i7 eighty seven
ok we see a 24% reduction in performance
with hyper-threading disabled naturally
that kind of performance drop won't go
unnoticed furthermore in terms of
performance we're essentially turning
the 87 okay into a 77 okay so that's a
fair old downgrade for those that would
have bought an 87 hundred K meanwhile
the 7700 K becomes 26% slot with
hyper-threading disabled and now we have
a plain old quad core or Core i5 of that
generation so naturally for applications
that heavily leveraged all cores
disabling SMT or hyper threading has a
big impact on performance moving on to
some testing with WinRAR and here we see
a massive 36% reduction and throughput
for the 87 or okay clearly hyper
threading works really well for this
type of workload likewise we see a
massive drop-off for the 77 RK as well a
39 percent reduction in this case so
hyper threading is very advantageous for
this kind of processing the second last
application benchmark I'm going to look
at is Corona and here the 87 okay so a
31% performance decrease with hyper
threading disabled while the 77 our case
or a similar 33 percent drop off again
both were obviously significant
performance decreases so depending on
how much these updates impact hyper
threading performance we could see some
pretty big moments drop-offs in
rendering and encoding workloads then
finally the last application I'm going
to look at is blender and like cinema
jar 20 we're seeing around a 25% drop
off for the 87 or okay with hyper
threading disabled I say only 25%
because we have seen up to a 36%
decrease but a 25% D
Risa's certainly nothing to take lightly
then we have the 7700 K with its fewer
cores and it does suffer a little more
and here we see a 29 percent performance
reduction before we move on a gaming I
just want to quickly note some total
system power consumption numbers and
granted we're not looking at the
individual process of consumption here
so it is hard to comment on efficiency
but you can see that the 87 are ok with
hyper-threading disable doesn't really
save us that much power in this test
we're seeing just a 5 percent reduction
in total system consumption the 77 or
okay was better leverage for
hyper-threading enabled and here we saw
an 11 percent reduction which is
probably more in line with the
performance drop-off that we saw again
keep in mind we are looking at total
system power consumption anyway time to
move on to some gaming benchmarks and
first that we have the ternary peer
results for Assassin's Creed Odyssey
here the 87 ok only sorry 13% reduction
for the average framerate and no change
the 1% low the 77 okay on the other hand
with its fuel costs or a massive
reduction for both the average framerate
and 1% low result here we saw a 23% drop
up for the average framerate and 21%
drop up for the 1% low so those with
quad-core processors will be impacted
significantly more by a reduction in
hyper-threading performance now if
you're primarily GPU bound the 80 simmer
ok does just fine without hyper
threading enabled and we see that here
at 1440p even with an RT X xx 82 I that
said the 77 error case still suffers an
18% reduction in the average framerate
performance so again those with quad
cores and God forbid a dual-core any
reduction hyper threading efficiency is
really going to sting battlefield 5 is a
very CPU intensive title though for this
one we only had time to test the
single-player portion of the game and
even then we needed to origin accounts
just to finish our testing because of
that delightful Hardware lockout anyway
keeping on the subject we don't really
see much of our performance decline here
the biggest drop-off was up to 12% we're
looking at the 1% low margin for the 77
her ok increasing the resolution or
1440p didn't really help with the 1% low
performance for the 77 ok and here we
see in both instances disabling
hyper-threading does reduce performance
again it's not major but I doubt any
gamers will welcome a 5 to 12 percent
reduction in performance oh wow this is
pretty brutal look at the performance
drop off
77 okay with hyper-threading disabled in
the division - that's similar to the
reduction we saw in testing with winrar
so here the average frame rate is
reduced by 37% and the 1% low result by
38% again pretty brutal stuff I'm sure
there's a few core i5 quad core owners
watching this thinking hey my PC plays
the division - quite well and well I bet
it does we're still seeing over 60 FPS
at all times
but we're also seeing a massive
reduction of performance with
hyper-threading disabled the performance
impact for the six karate 700 K isn't
nearly as extreme but even so a 13% dip
in 1% low performance won't be
appreciated by most gamers moving a
1440p and now with hyper-threading
disabled 87 or okay isn't the
performance limiting component rather
that would be the RT x 28 DTI however
we're still seeing a 32% reduction for
the 77 okay we're looking at 1% low
performance okay so if you're looking at
these results a little cross-eyed then
let me explain farcry new dawn is a
title that plays much better on the 9700
k than it does the 87 okay
and at the 97 okay allows for around 120
FPS on average at 1080p I bring this up
because when we disable hyper threading
on the 87 okay it matches the 9700 K in
this test despite having two less cause
so basically six cores and six threads
is more efficient this total and six
cores with 12 threads and we do see this
quite a bit in games when testing SMT
that said the 7700 K with its fewer
cause doesn't suffer the same issue with
hyper threading enabled though it was
still a smidgen faster with it disabled
so at least for this game running
without hyper threading is pretty much a
non-issue and in fact it's likely going
to be beneficial though probably not if
you have a dual-core moving to 1440p and
we see that the core count isn't an
issue here it's actually hyper threading
that's slowing down the 7700 okay and 87
huh
this is similar to what we saw at 1080p
though the effect seems to be more
amplified here moving on we have hitman
- and here we say that disabling hyper
threading has no real impact on
performance for the 87 or okay however
once again we see the impact for the 77
okay is quite devastating the average
frame rate dropped by 18% but far worse
than that was the massive almost 30%
reduction in 1% low performance granted
we're still seeing over 60 FPS at all
times but for those chasing big frame
rates this
kind of performance here is brutal even
at 1440p the 7700 K is hit hard with
hyper-threading disabled as we're still
seeing a 25% reduction in 1% low
performance next up we have a rage too
and here the 87 okay so almost no
declining performance with
hyper-threading disabled the 77 okay on
the other hand here we see that although
the average frame rate is virtually
unchanged the 1% low performance drops
about 20% so that's obviously a
significant reduction however once we
increase the resolution to 1440p that is
enough to remove the cpu as the
performance limiting component at least
when looking at the hyper threading law
77 or okay so here disabling hyper
threading has no impact on performance
we found in the past that shadow of the
Tomb Raider is a very demanding title
and we're getting a pretty clear
reminder of that here the 8700 K saw a
10 to 12 percent performance drop off
with hyper-threading disabled while the
7700 K saw a 24 percent drop off though
the one percent low margins were similar
to what we witnessed with the 87 or okay
in either case disabling SMT does have a
big impact on performance in this title
even at 1440p the effect is quite
significant at least for the 77 RK the
87 era case still saw a small
performance to climb but it was nothing
like the 20% drop off the 7700 case
suffered last up we have some World War
Z results using the low-level Vulkan API
and here we see the game runs just fine
with four cores so neither CPU suffers
with hyper-threading disabled that being
the case we naturally see a similar
thing at 1440p both CPUs are able to
extract the maximum performance from the
RT X xx atti okay so we've now got a
pretty good idea of how intel's 4 &amp;amp; 6
core cpus perform with hyper-threading
enabled and then disabled but to quickly
summarize for those of you who just
skipped over the results in court heavy
applications the performance reduction
is typically anywhere from 25 to 35
percent the impact on gaming performance
does vary quite a bit and this will
depend on things such as the game used
that's probably important but there are
other factors such as the resolution for
quality settings and then of course your
hardware configuration so your CPU and
GPU depending on what CPU use and what
GPU use you could be bottlenecked more
so by one or the other
but I would say for today's games the
six core
all parts there right on the edge for
the most part get away without
hyper-threading in today's games but we
did see instances where the 1%
performance did suffer at times so yeah
if you're chasing really high frame
rates or a higher refresh rate gamer
then the performance drop from losing
hyper-threading on a 6 core part will
certainly be noticed then for those of
you with an eight-course 16 thread part
like the 9900 K the impact on gaming
performance will be virtually
non-existent I haven't tested that in
this video but we have looked at that
sort of thing in the past and pretty
much all games will run really well on
an 8 core processor I've seen that when
comparing the 9700 K and the 9900 K you
know games previously that said
application performance we'll see quite
a noticeable drop even with the 99er ok
that is assuming the application uses
all at cause quite heavily and you
should expect to see around a 25 to 35
percent performance drop with SMT
support and disabled but again that will
depend on the application and then of
course all of this is well it's it's
much more impactful when you have a
lower end CPU so we showed how
hyper-threading performs with the 7700
ok when it's enabled and disabled and
this will be even more significant for
dual core parts with hyper-threading
which are sort of right on the edge now
they're getting away they're there
they're reasonable make-do solutions but
without hyper threading they're pretty
unusable for now we don't know exactly
how much of an impact we for MDS
mitigations will have a performance at
least for these windows-based
applications and games but we know there
will be a performance hit and we know it
will be felt most where hyper threading
has the biggest impact for onyx has
tested the mitigations on linux and the
performance impact ranges from
negligible to massive again we don't yet
know what the impact will be for Windows
users but we're confident there will be
a reduction performance of some sort
particularly in the scenarios just
showing that saw substantial performance
downgrades with hyper threading disabled
products also found that Intel systems
are now around 16% slower out of the box
than they were before they Spector
meltdown for Shadow and zombie load
mitigations meanwhile AMD has only seen
a 3 percent performance drop they
also went on to say that the mitigation
impact is enough to draw the core i7 87
came much closer to the Rison 720 700 X
and the core I 9 79 80 XE - the threat
Ripper 2990 WX now I'm sure there'll be
some Intel fans that shrug their
shoulders and say who cares the 98 is
still faster than 2,700 X Man well yeah
I guess that's fair enough but you'd
have to be happy with paying almost
twice as much for a CPU that seems to
continually become slower over time
Korra 999 okay owners aside this is
almost certainly going to be disastrous
news for those using a dual-core or
quad-core Intel CPU that supports hyper
threading this includes all core i3
processors from Clarkdale 2 kb lake core
i7s up 2 kb lake as well as kb lake and
coffee-like pentium processors three
years ago now I looked at how the core
i3 6100 performed with and without hyper
threading and the gaming performance
results without hyper threading were
quite horrendous in some titles the CPU
was choked so badly the performance
dropped off by more than 50% the crazy
thing is three years ago using a modest
GPU of the time the performance hit in
almost all tested games was significant
even gamers using a gtx 1050 try with
ultra quality settings at 1080p we're
going to notice big performance
drop-offs
so any impact on hyper threading is
effectiveness for these CPUs is going to
be bad news for anyone using them I
guess for those of you using older
hardware the best performance option is
just to never update your BIOS again
given the impact it's likely going to
have on performance it's probably worth
the security risk as I said at the
beginning of the video the BIOS updates
that enable the mitigations on Windows
10 aren't yet available so we can't test
the true performance impact but we can
at least show you a worst case scenario
so presumably it will end up somewhere
in the middle there this does put us in
a bit of a pickle though as I was just
about to start updating all my CPU
performance numbers I know other media
outlets have started doing that in
anticipation of Zen twos release so yeah
that's made things a little bit
difficult because if I invest days upon
days of updating all the numbers for the
Intel processors and then these BIOS
updates do come out during or after
Computex
those
numbers are pretty well invalid and I'd
have to go do all the testing again
which I don't want to do so I've just
put that on pause for now I'll see what
the deal is after Computex and then
hopefully by then we will have am the
new bias revisions with the updated
micro code from Intel anyway I thought
it was interesting to see where hyper
threading makes the biggest difference
on these processes so hopefully you've
found the results interesting and yeah
hopefully in the not-too-distant future
will actually be able to see what the
impact of the MDS vulnerabilities is for
Intel processors on Windows 10 anyway
