after much waiting much hype we can
finally bring you our AMD desktop APU
review on Hana for testing is the Rison
520 400 g and arisin 322 energy and
before we enter the benchmarks I'm going
to go over what it is that each of these
processes has to offer
AMD's introducing these new AP use to
better support their entry-level to
mid-range product lines and this means
that the 2400 g and 22 energy will be
replacing the arisin v 1400 and verizon
3 1200 though i think it's fair to say
they'll likely make the r3 1300 X and r5
1500 X somewhat pointless as well but
we'll look into that before reviews end
so these new AP use codenamed Raven
Ridge are built using these same 14
nanometer processes of the original rise
and CPUs they're aimed ease marketing it
as a 14 nanometer plus process much like
what Intel does basically what this
means is the process is matured to the
point where they can dial up the clock
speeds a little more and this is exactly
what they've done but we'll talk about
the clock speeds in a moment one of the
more notable changes is to the CPU
design which sees Raven reducing a
single CCX module this design approach
means that we are limited to 4 cores
naturally there are positives and
negative aspects to this design the key
advantages of the latency penalty seem
when moving data between the CCX modules
this is effectively eliminated though
based on our own testing that didn't
really appear to be a big issue anyway
the big advantage here for AMD is that
they fit the same amount of cores that
you'll see in a rising 3 CPU but they've
done it while taking up half the space
the disadvantage being that you get well
less CPU the l3 cache gets cut down from
potentially 16 megabytes to 8 megabytes
but AMD decided to have it again and now
the Raven Ridge models come with just 4
megabytes so this means while the Rison
5 1400 has an 8 mega byte level 3 cache
the 1500 xpac 16 megabytes
the 2400 g and 2200 G will offer just 4
megabytes now that sounds pretty bad but
anybody believes they'd be able to
offset that reduction with higher bass
boost and average clock speeds another
event
helps offset their reduction in capacity
is reduce cache and memory latency and
this is actually a result of having less
cache so it's not all bad news
AMD believes that overall this will be a
net positive performance improvement for
productivity workloads in a particular
games that you're more sensitive to
memory latency there's more
corner-cutting to reduce production
costs Raven Ridge only packs 8 PCI
Express lanes not 16 like the first
generation rise in CPUs aim DS made this
sacrifices they don't believe it will
impact the performance of mid-range
discrete graphics cards it's unlikely
those rocking an AP you'll be upgrading
to a GTX 1082 anytime soon so it makes
sense
AMD says the reduction in PCIe lanes
also helps contribute to a smaller and
more efficient uncor as well for those
of you wondering the uncor is a term
first used by Intel described aspects of
the CPU that are not within the core but
are closely connected to it for maximum
performance things such as the level 3
cache andand a memory controller for
example
Ami's also saved money by using a
nonmetallic Tim for the 2400 G in 2012 G
we're not sure if Lea using the same
tooth paste as Intel but we'll of course
investigate load temperatures this
though does confirm what we pretty much
already knew Intel's been doing this to
save on production costs and therefore
maximize profits because well AMD is
doing the exact same thing now with
their most affordable CPUs the
difference though is that they're
admitting that this is why they're doing
it they've also revised the CPU package
and AMD says this has allowed them to
officially support ddr4 2933 memory
that's a very important feature for
these AEP users memory performances of
the utmost importance for integrated
graphics like the mobile parts the
desktop Raven Ridge CPU support
precision boost to technology which is
basically a more aggressive version of
what was featured in the original Rison
processors of course the most notable
change is the inclusion of the Vega
graphics connected to the CPU using the
Infinity fabric is a Vega GPU featuring
11c use for the 2400 G at 8c use for the
2200 G and advantage to using the Vega
architecture over Polaris is clock speed
both versions operated over 1,000
megahertz and can in fact be pushed to
over 1.5 gigahertz so let's just quickly
go over the specs of these new APIs
before jumping into
benchmarks both the quad cores using a
single CCX but the risin 5 model gets
SMT support for 8 threads the 2500 G is
also clocked higher with a base
frequency of 3.6 gigahertz and a maximum
boost of 3.9 gigahertz the 2200 G
meanwhile operates at a base frequency
of 3.5 gigahertz but can boost as high
as 3.7 gigahertz the only other major
difference is the Vega GPU which as I
said a moment ago the 2400 G gets 11 C's
which gives it 704 stream processors or
cores which operate at 1250 mega Hertz
the 2200 gene has been downgraded to 8 C
use for 512 cause now operate at 1100
megahertz
both are 65 watt parts but can be
configured down to 45 watts they also
both support dual channel ddr3 933
memory well that about covers everything
you need to know for now it's time to
see how they perform for testing I'm
using a be 350 motherboard with
sixteen-year bytes of ddr4 3200 memory
first we'll check application
performance before moving into gaming
with and without a discrete graphics
card along with some memory scaling
performance of course we'll also touch
on things like power consumption
overclocking and temperatures starting
with the memory bandwidth performance we
see in the 2400 G and 2200 G are very
similar to the original rise in 3 and
risin 5 processors this though was
expected and it should provide the
integrated Vega GP with enough bandwidth
to deliver reasonably good performance
but we'll look into that shortly next up
we have some Cinebench r15 results and
here the new Raven Ridge apu is very
good narrowly beating the X versions of
their own product lines in fact the 2400
G was just 6% slower than the core i5
8400 which is impressive particularly
given that it can still be overclocked
meanwhile the 2012 G was only slightly
slower than the core i3 8100 the last
synthetic benchmark we're going to look
at is PC mark 10 and this generally
favors clock speed over call counters
the applications that users for testing
only utilized 2 to 4 threads performance
wise the 22 energy was a fraction slower
than 1300 X while the 2400 G basically
matched the score of the 1500 X so this
then aligns with what we saw in testing
with Cinebench r15 moving on to the
Excel Monte Carlo simulation we fought
the 2400 G is 16% slower than the 1500 X
perhaps this is a result of having less
cash
oddly however the 2200 G was 7% faster
than 1300 ex though of course the 1300 X
does have half as much l3 cache as the
1500 X in any case the Raven Ridge APIs
provided strong performance in this test
performance was much the same between
the Raven Ridge AP use and the rise in 3
and Rison 5x models when testing with
veracrypt the 2200 G was slightly ahead
of the 1300 X while the 2400 G was
slightly behind the 1500 X when testing
with 7-zip we see that the 2020 G is
slightly ahead of a 1300 X making it
slightly sold in the core i3 8100
meanwhile the 2400 G was fast in the
1500 X for the decompression test but
quite a bit slower for the compression
test testing with Premiere Pro CC shows
a very small improvement in performance
for the 2422 energy over the 1500 X and
1300 X so it's good to see another
application where the massive reduction
level 3 cache has no performance impact
and if anything it's actually helped to
increase the performance due to the
improved latency both the 2400 G and 22
energy are able to slightly improve upon
the X models though them Hudgins were
slim the 2400 G for example is just 2
percent faster than the 1500x it was her
over 8% fast and the core i3
8350 K then when testing with Corona we
do see a similar thing here the Raven
Ridge ApS are basically able to match
the X models making the 1500 X and 1300
X somewhat pointless now the 2200 G also
matched the core i3 8100 while the 2400
G was just a fraction slower than the
core i5 8400 the last application
benchmark that we're gonna be looking at
is Pomeroy and here the 2020 G was 8
percent faster than the 1300 X while the
2400 G was just a single percent fast
and the 1500 X that said though I should
note the Raven Ridge parts were
noticeably slower than the similarly
priced Intel processors in this test ok
so that's all the boring productivity
stuff out of the way
it's time to play some games this next
batch of results were again recorded
with the Raven Ridge ap use using ddr4
3200 memory the pentium g 4560 now that
was tested with ddr4 2133 memory because
this is the fastest memory speed at the
H 110 motherboard users and that's the
motherboard we'll be using for all the
pricing comparisons at the end of the
video but of course it will be paired
with a geforce GT
ten-thirty graphics card as well because
that onboard intel graphics isn't
particularly great then we also have the
core i3 8180 350k and the a12 9800 and
again they will all be using their
integrated graphics solutions starting
with csgo at 720p we see the 2400 is
able to roughly match the G 45 60 and GT
1030 combo meanwhile the 2200 G manages
the same 1% lower result but is 12%
solid for the average frame rate that
said it was almost 70% fast in the core
i3 8350 Kane 71% fast in the 80 100
moving to 1080p we again find the 2400 G
matching the G 45 60 and GT 1030 combo
while the 22 energy was 18% slower still
an average of a hundred and 38 FPS is
remarkable and this meant the 2020 G was
90% faster than the a12 900 almost a
hundred percent faster than any of the
8th gen core i3 models next up we have
pub G which isn't a title that is
particularly kind to AMD hardware and as
a result the 2400 G does slip behind the
G 45 60 and GT 1030 combo still with 57
FPS on average it's a very playable so
there's at least that the 2200 G was 12%
slower on average but 27% solve for the
one percent low result and this meant
that it wasn't quite as smooth still
compared to the a12 900 which was
completely unplayable it was a massive
step up the 1080p resolution though that
proved to be a little too much in this
poorly optimized title and while some
might find the 2400 G playable here it
wasn't by my budget PC standards even
the G 45 60 and GT 1030 struggled though
the experience was noticeably better
unlike pub G fortnight is quite good on
the optimisation front and although the
G 45 60 and GT 1030 were faster the 2400
G offered exceptional performance that
was very playable never dipping below 70
FPS in our tests the 2200 G also had a
little trouble delivering playable voice
with almost 60 FPS on average and this
man it was over 30% faster on the a12
900 and well over twice as fast as the
8th gen core i3 processors the 2400 G
was still able to the playable
performance at 1080p and remember we are
using the medium quality settings here
so there is still room to improve
performance further the G 45 60 and GT
10
30 combo was just 10% faster so an
impressive result for the 2400 G that
was won in a game at 1080p with the 2200
G we'll need to look at how it performs
with the low quality settings next up we
have our overwatch and this is a great
game for stressing both the CPU and GPU
as you can see the 2400 G match the G 45
60 and GT 1030 combo with 98 FPS on
average but was 14% faster for the 1%
lower result in fact the 2200 G was able
to deliver a better 1% low result as
well not only that but when compared to
other integrated solutions the 2200 G
proved to be an absolute beast
delivering a hundred and thirty-eight
percent more performance than the a 12
900 158 percent more than the 83 50 K
the Raven bridge AP use were again able
to deliver playable performance at 1080p
and the 2400 G edged at the Pentium G 45
60 and GT 1030 combo for what was a
truly impressive result those wanting to
play rocket League at 720p can do so
using the highest possible in-game
quality settings and still achieve over
60 FPS at all times using either of
these ap use and that's pretty awesome
in fact both beat the GT 1030 by a
comfortable margin Ramos twice as fast
as the a12 900 that said at 1080p we've
seen here running into a bandwidth issue
as performance fell by 45% for the APS
whereas the Pentium G 45 60 and GT 1030
combo only took over 30 percent
performance here still even at turn DP
with the visual quality settings maxed
out the game was very playable using
these new ap use moving on we have dota
2 and again the Raven Ridge ap use allow
for the visual quality settings to be
maxed out at 720p the pentium g 45 60
did maintain a better 1% low performance
but still overall the aps were mighty
impressive the 2200 g in particular is a
standout here with almost 70 FPS on
average once again though things do
start the car apart a little bit of
1080p and the discrete GPU pair with the
g 45 60 now offers noticeably better
performance still when compared to the
a12 900 which was world's better than
any of the 8th gen core i3 processors
the 2200 g was 35% faster next up we
have Rainbow six siege and although
we're only using the low quality
so that 1080p I was still blown away by
the results a 2400 G beat the penny mg
45 60 and GT 1030 combo with relative
ease while the 2200 G was right up there
as well when compared to the a12 900 the
2200 G was a whopping 56% faster and a
hundred and fifty-four percent faster
than the core i3 80 350 K even at Tahlia
P the Raven bridge AP's hung in there
and in fact it did exceptionally well
the 2200 G matched the pentium g 45 60
and GT 1030 combo while the 2400 G was
almost 20% faster not only that but was
75 FPS on average with a minimum of 62
fps the result was silky smooth gameplay
this right here shows us just how poorly
optimized pub G is even with the low
quality settings battlefront looks great
and it plays great with either of these
ap use the game really requires four
cores but if you can feed it eight
threads well that's even better much
better in fact because of this the 2400
G was able to crush the G 4560
delivering 87% better performance for
the one percent low result even at 1080p
the Raven Ridge AP use do very well
though here the 2200 G does start to
fall behind the G 45 60 and GT 1030
combo for the one percent low result but
still overall exceptional performance
this CPU intensive game cripples the a
12 9800 and reduces it to the same
miserable performance seen from the core
i3 processors finally the last game
tested is Wolfenstein - unlike pub G
this title loves AMD Hardware here we
see the 2400 G spinning at an incredible
95 FPS on average with a 1% lower result
of 88 fps and that's pretty amazing the
2200 G might have been around 15% slower
but it was just as impressive and beat
the penny mg 45 60 and GT 1030 combo by
a 56% margin it's odd how well the a12
9800 does for the average frame rate but
how slow it is for the 1% low needless
to say the experience wasn't smooth we
see very similar margins eternity pian
here it was really only the 2200 G and
2400 G that were able to deliver smooth
playable performance so that's a great
result for AMD ok so here's how the 2400
G + 22 energy performed with the
integrated Vega GPU disabled and replace
with the Radeon rx 550
here we see if the 2200 G is just 8%
faster with the discrete graphics card
installed so that really speaks to how
impressive the 8cu integrated Vega GPU
is the 2400 G meanwhile is improved by
just 4% so stock the Vega 11 cu GPU is
basically an rx 550 as we suspected that
said at Tempe we see the benefits of
local GPU memory the rx 550 starts to
pull ahead still the Raven breh GPUs do
do remarkably well it's interesting to
note that the 1% lower results with the
rx 550 are noticeably better with the
1300 X and 1500 X opposed to the new ap
use that'll be something that I'll look
into in the future with a wider
selection of games
remember overwatch is a very CPU
intensive title and running the bot
match test rather than dig through all
the data for the other out games I've
tested I'm just gonna move on to
something that I feel is a bit more
important for would-be buyers and that
is overclocking power consumption
temperatures and the all-important
memory scaling so let's start by taking
a quick look at the overclocking I'm
only gonna be showing the results for a
single game right now I know there is
much more testing be done but I only had
so much time to put this video together
so yeah one game it is for now this
should though give us a pretty good idea
of what's possible but as I said there
will be a future video dedicated solely
to overclocking please note that all the
overclocking in this video was done so
with the stock box cooler it's really
only possible to overclock the GPU using
this cooler especially if you'll want to
go to the frequency that we have so yeah
I don't believe you better do CPU and
GPU overclocking with the Box cooler
it's not really a big deal as most of
the gains will be seen when GPU
overclocking by default the 2200 G runs
it's very good cause at one point one
gigahertz and the 2400 G at one point to
five gigahertz both tho had been pushed
to 1.6 gigahertz using a 1.3 volts and
here are the results here are the 720p
results and interestingly I was only
able to boost the fortnight result for
the 2400 G by 8% I mean that's not bad
but we did increase the GPU clock speed
by 28% so you should be able to extract
better performance what we're seeing
here in fact we see that with the 2200 G
which for some reason responded to the
overclocking much better here we're able
to boost the performance by a massive
29% and now the 2200 G is able to match
the stock 2400 G in this title similar
margins were seen at Tony P though this
time the 2200 G performance was boosted
by 35% though that wasn't quite enough
to match the stock 2400 G this time
still overall great results and I'm keen
to spend much more time playing around
the overclocking capabilities of these
new AP use now this first lot of power
consumption figures includes a GTX 1082
I installed this is how we typically
test desktop processors but I've
conducted some extra testing for these
new ap use and we'll get to that in a
moment so with the gtx 980ti installed
we see that under loading the corona
benchmark the 2200 g consumes slightly
more power in the 1300 X while the 2400
G also consumed slightly more than the
1500 X what's interesting to note here
is that both consumed less when at idle
and I should point out that the same
motherboard and power supply was used
for this testing okay so these power
consumption results are more
representative as they are recorded
using the integrated graphics only for
all the CPUs tested here we see the 2200
G consumes slightly less power in the
core i3 8350 K and slightly more than
the core i3 8100 not bad but it was 11%
sold in the 8100 in this test the 2400 G
on the other hand was 8% fast in the 83
50k but only consumed 5% more power so
SMT really helps to improve efficiency
here I've also included the overclocking
results for the 2400 G with the Vega GPU
running at 1.6 gigahertz and this
increased the power draw in this
application by 27% then when it came
time to game the 2200 G again found
itself positioned between the core i3 a
183 50k despite delivering considerably
better performance and overwatch thanks
to the Vega GPU the 2400 G consumed
almost 30% more power than the 2200 G
making the cheaper apu the more
efficient option for gaming finally we
see when overclocking the 2400 G the
power drill was increased by 23% using
the included Wraith stealth box cool of
these are the temperatures we saw with
an ambient room temperature of 21
degrees under maximum load in the
blender test we hit 67 degrees for the
CPU and GPU on the 2200 G and 74 degrees
for the 2400 G gaming temperatures were
lower playing overwatch for
the 22 energy hit a peak CPU temperature
of 60 degrees and a GPU temperature of
57 degrees the 2400 G on the other hand
was very similar hitting 59 degrees for
both the GPU and CPU as a side note I
should just mention that overclocking
the Vega GPU to 1.6 gigahertz did push
the temps with both the CPU and GPU to
around 90 degrees with this stock cooler
but I'll cover this in more detail and
an overclocking video soon for now it's
time to check out memory scaling
performance first up we have the dual
channel results using the 2200 G and
these figures were recording the csgo
benchmark at 720p so all the previous
testing was done using ddr4 3200 memory
and here we can see that certainly
optimal I was able to get this kid to
3466 but I had to lower the timings and
this reduce the performance benefits of
operating at this higher speed what we
can quite clearly see here is that
dropping down from 3200 to the official
29:33 spec reduced the average frame
rate by 6 percent then we saw a further
6 percent reduction when going from 29
33 to 2666
and then 8% from 2666 to 2400 if you
were to use the ddr4 2400 memory and a
dual channel configuration you stand to
lose 20% performance when compared to
what we've shown in this video
some of you suggested to me that you'd
like to run these new Raven Ridge APs
with a single 8 gigabyte memory module
because that's a cheaper option at the
moment given these results I strongly
recommend you stick to dual channel
memory operation here is a better graph
showing the real performance impact
using ddr4 3,200 memory you'll see a
massive 33 percent reduction in frame
rate using a single memory module and
this figure continues to increase as the
memory speed is reduced so please stick
with the dual channel memory mode well
that's what four days of solid testing
and almost no sleep looks like and
that's forgetting the week's worth of
testing I did for all the comparison
data before even getting to the AP use
but I think it's all been worth it we
now have a really good idea of what the
Raven Ridge ap use have to offer so
let's talk about that performance wise
the 2400 G + 22 energy are impressive
both the CPU and GPU performance is
exceptional irrespective price points
additionally they can be paired with
existing B 350 and
370 motherboards which is obviously
great news for consumers
they're also excellent when it comes to
performance per watt particularly in 3d
workloads
the 2200 G is coming in at just $100 us
and the 2400 year one hundred and
seventy dollars us both appear to be
exceptionally good value now let's talk
a bit more about that the pentium g 4560
currently costs $80 can be installed on
a $50 h 110 motherboard and paired with
a GT 1030 for about $90 so all up a two
hundred and twenty dollar u.s. combo the
risin 5 2400 G offers a similar gaming
experience and vastly superior
productivity performance it cost just
$20 more so $240 us with a be 350
motherboard the 2200 G on the other hand
is slightly slower overall but comes in
around $50 cheaper at 170 dollars us
including a motherboard it's also much
better for proximity workloads so if the
game was on a tight budget the Rison 320
200 G certainly seems like the way to go
then when compared to the pentium g 45
60 the Rison 5:24 energy really makes
more sense and should prove to be a far
better investment over time the core i3
8100 comparison is more difficult as
we're stuck with said 370 boards for now
and they cost at least 110 dollars us
but I'm gonna pretend that's not
actually the case and you can get a B
360 board for $70 and hopefully that
will be a reality in the not-too-distant
future even so with a $70 motherboard
and the GT 1030 you're looking at a
total bill of almost $300 u.s. and that
makes the 2400 G considerably better
value as you're not just paying less for
the combo but you're also getting a more
powerful CPU so this looks like a solid
win for AMD across the board there is
however a slight hitch here that needs
to be addressed memory pricing of course
memory prices are high across the board
but they are particularly high when
looking at high-speed
Rison friendly memory the ddr4 2400 16
gigabyte kit used for testing the core
i3 8100 for example cost $160 u.s. and
this is for a pair of 8 gigabyte modules
that's mighty expensive by 2016 s memory
prices but today it's just the norm
the G skilful rx ddr4 3200 16 gigabyte
kit that AMD provided for testing and I
also use them
Rison rig costs 250 dollars u.s. that
means you're paying a little over 50%
more for the horizon optimized memory
I'm yet to figure out which ddr4 memory
will work at 29 33 and faster with the
Raven Ridge APU so it is possible that
there's cheaper memory but I can't
confirm that at this point that said I
should note the ddr4 3,200 memory does
start at $225 us for a 16 gigabyte kits
that's still a 40% price premium though
this margin is at least half with the 8
gigabyte kits so that's something what
this means though is that right now it's
the ddr4 memory prices that are really
killing the value of these in your AMD
APU 's whether discrete graphics card
memory speed really doesn't matter if
you throw a G 45 60 unlock is dead 270
motherboard and pair it with ddr4 4000
memory you look best see a few extra
frames with the gtx 1050 1050 Ti or even
a 1060 this means giving current memory
prices you possibly better off going
with a discrete graphics card which is a
real shame that said though the Rison
320 200 G combo with 8 gigabytes of ddr4
30 ton of memory that cost $275 as
you're faced with 105 dollar u.s. bill
for the memory still as I said 8
gigabytes of ddr4 2,400 memory isn't
that much cheaper and you're paying at
least $85 u.s. anyway for the memory so
that makes the total bill for the
pentium g 4560 combo about three hundred
and five dollars u.s. it really also
depends on what you want from the system
if you want to build the smallest
possible gaming rig than the Raven Ridge
ap use or for something unique that said
though even if you want to build a micro
ATX or even a standard ATX system though
2400 G has a legs and in the future when
you can afford a GTX 1060 or rx 580
it'll be able to extract maximum
performance from those graphics cards I
still can't work out which APU I prefer
they're both just so bloody good in
their own right initially I thought it
would be all about the Rison 520 400 G
but I've shifted away from that thinking
and I really like what the Rison 322
energy has to offer budget gamers this
APU motherboard and memory combo for
well under $300 u.s. simply can't be
beat and for that reason I think it's
going to be a hot item for gamers on a
budget it's also worth noting when I
started testing these EP use last week
the Vega drivers that were quite buggy
anybody has since released an updated
version that pretty much solved all the
stuttering issues I was seeing so that's
great
they also say that further driver
optimizations are coming and performance
will get better and we'll give an aim DS
history I believe them one thing to
remember when buying a Raven Ridge apu
is that memory speed matters it really
really matters you gotta want at least
ddr4 memory capable of running at 2933
for them to really make sense and well
that's going to do it for this one I
