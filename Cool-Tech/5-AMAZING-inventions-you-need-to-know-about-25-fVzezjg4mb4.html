my name is Oscar I live in New York City
I produce film shoot commercials and
direct videos movies cost money I manage
the budgets see that bulge in my pants
that's my wallet insurance card credit
cards debit cards library cards gift
cards membership cards work ID business
check and triple a metrocard a bunch of
things I don't need coin is a company
that makes one card for all of your
cards that is all of your cards become
one but first I had to see if it would
work every works okay cool so let's see
if it actually works for me for a whole
week Wednesday left my office took a
taxi of the airport and flew to Los
Angeles to make a music video rented a
car at dinner with a friend went
location scout tried to hold the camera
while gassing out the car at the same
time Thursday figure out casting founder
Pharma shootout milky boat rented lights
rent a camera trucks wardrobe crops
bought food for the crew
more gas more coffees finish the video
took the drug for drinks got an enormous
plate of nachos which a nobody a tried
to fly back to New York but the storm
force applies and I went to Philadelphia
instead took a train of the city and
took the subway home coin is not a metro
card not yet anyway
I was wondering how you do that myself
so I checked out the coin headquarters
and got schooled on swiping the coins
been developing a super thin battery in
Bluetooth signal for the last three
years along with the magnet that safely
represents all of your cards and
functions with all kinds of card
machines look at all those swipers
friday flew to Mexico City's see my
girlfriend drove out to the coast
Esmeralda where we just happened to have
an entire hotel to ourselves except for
two dogs in here and Philippe the card
still works on our team Monday back to
New York for more editing we're coffee
on the gift card a lot of places that
are cash home or subways where taxes

the mountains she was ski video with an
old friend bluebirds guys should be a
good one but breakfast on my mastercard
buy sunscreen on my visa rented skis
boots pulls got a lift ticket and charge
it all on my coin then have my friend
folded while doing all these tricks can
just look at it all in all is a pretty
good week ditch those got rid of all
these forgot about those kept this get
that thanks going
you
here we go
you
Oh
I believe we're beginning to see the
revival of the tradesmen those willing
to build products the way they used to
be built the way they should be built by
hand with premium materials to withstand
time we're also seeing a change in
mindset where quality Trump's quantity
we're tired of products wearing out and
they're willing to pay more for
something that will last I was on a trip
a few years back and I reached into my
bag and I sliced open my finger who has
a craftsman i sat down and responded by
designing a one-size-fits-all razor
cover it worked so well I knew I needed
to bring this product to market I was
also frustrated by toiletry bags that
never seemed to fit into my suitcase so
I came up with a design that was flat
and both packable and functional I
paired these two products together and
traveler with four traveler can served
as a Dopp kit toiletry bag or makeup
case and comes with your choice of
standard or safety razor covers the
entire kit is crafted from full grain
horween leather it has a water resistant
finish at range leather we craft
products for we're in not out and we're
proud to carry on the tradition of the
tradesman
