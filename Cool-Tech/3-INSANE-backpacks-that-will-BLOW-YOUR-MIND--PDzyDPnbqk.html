building a better future we create tools
for global citizens of tomorrow we make
awesome stuff at the intersection of
fashion technology
hey I'm Adrian the Canadian in September
2015 I met an incredible girl just two
months later we were sitting in a cafe
in Barcelona and her bag was stolen
right from between our chairs inside of
her bag was her laptop passport iPhone
all of her valuables since it was my
idea to be in Barcelona in the first
place I felt really guilty so I set out
to impress her by making bag that would
never be stolen again a couple of months
later on a tiny budget with help of
friends designers and models I launched
a life back on Kickstarter we raised six
hundred and thirteen thousand dollars
from three thousand seven hundred and
five backers I quickly had to assemble
an awesome team of people to help
fulfill all of these orders to date
we've shipped over 15,000 life facts to
people all over the world and from these
customers we've had some great feedback
on what kind of products I'd like to see
in our new collection both bags include
a new solo drop proof laptop storage
secret and secure pockets for your
passport credit cards or travel cards
and our patented locking system it
allows the bag to be locked to something
and lock shut instead of being worried
about someone taking your stuff this
gives you peace of mind and allows you
to focus on what support in the backpack
specifically there's really cool
features like this priority pocket
through everyday essentials
there's magnetic closures they can get
super fast to close the bag and not
worry about it going there's an easy
access USB port powered by the solar man
so you can charge your phone on the
super organized storage pockets on the
inside and custom hardware can double
through the bottom over on the shoulder
bag there's quick access directly to the
ports in the solar bag there's a nice
big pocket for your cables so they don't
get tangled up with everything special
pocket for your glasses or sunglasses
soft plush handles easy strap so you can
mount it onto your suitcase special hook
for your keys and of course a bottle
opener
if you were like me putting on your
favorite backpack can immediately bring
your past adventures to mind and if you
are like me then you've probably found
that your favorite backpack won't work
for every adventure and that is why we
are going to help change the way you
think about your back you move
seamlessly through life from one
activity to another so we created the
quiver a backpack system that adjusts to
your unique lifestyle the quiver is
based on an independent frame with
intentionally designed packs that swap
on and off every pack that we make will
fit on the same comfortable frame and
shoulder straps called the thruster
the thruster is a suspended mesh frame
which is more comfortable breathable and
makes your lo feel lighter with d-rings
and sunglass loops on the shoulder
straps you'll have easy access to all
the essentials the quiver allows you to
pick the perfect pack for your day
without having to compromise on features
or quality when you're choosing a pack
to clip onto the thruster you'll love
the Bandit for your daily grind the
features of the Bandit are carefully
designed for your commute the
compression straps are perfect for
holding a yoga mat water bottle and
jacket we've also included side and top
access pockets for your daily essentials
the Bandit is your perfect companion
from work to the bar or the gym
the clamshell design is great for both
organization and quick access to the
bottom of your bag
the quiver is designed for everyday
adventurers people whose next outing
could just as easily be an epic summit
or a climb before happy hour
come weekend swap on the side step and
hit the trail the side stuff is sure to
become your favorite hiking pack with a
large center compartment and minimalist
interior pockets you can efficiently
store all of your hiking essentials and
the horseshoe lid will make it quick and
easy to grab your extra jacket the
stretchy side pockets are great for
snacks or keeping your phone ready to
drop those grand hammers
we're from the rainy Pacific Northwest
so it is important to us that every pack
we design is water resistant by
designing the quiver around a single
frame we are reducing overall material
wastes and the clutter in your closet
the removable frame also makes our packs
much easier to repair keeping them out
of the landfill on the trail and full of
stories to pass on to the next
adventurer this has been a two-year
journey designing and developing the
quiver we've gone through over 100
prototypes these packs are designed
tested and ready to go but this is just
the beginning each season we are rolling
out more and more packs that work for
all kinds of adventures so you can
expand your quiver to fit your unique
lifestyle
we're excited for you to join our
community of everyday adventurers
