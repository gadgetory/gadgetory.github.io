camera to those who who don't want to
miss chatter chances so you can take any
photos even when your hands are full
like logging daily life blinking helps
you saving good memories of your life do
you remember the first time your kid
stood touch the doggy you should see the
moment not through screen of a
smartphone but with your eyes and take
pictures at the same time like cooking

hands you can record the processes
imagine how you take this picture
without blinking blinking helps you to
make recipes much easier
while enjoying outdoor activities like
cycling hiking or traveling you should
not pass by the good scenery but you
should take as many pictures as you like
at any moment blinking captures one to
see which may be something different
from usual pictures you've taken of
course while your hands are occupied

technologies such as camera but the

we all want to be that person the one
who wakes up early dive straight into a
morning meditation is super productive
at work drinks those eight glasses of
water and always hits the gym but let's
be real living that life means building
better habits and our brains want to
follow the ones we already have not the
new ones we're trying to cram it but
sometimes all you need is the right
nudge hi I'm Kayla and meet modi a smart
companion for building better habits we
created modi with a distinct purpose to
empower people to take those small steps
that over time result in big impacts in
our health and happiness these more than
just a cute face Modi is designed the
latest insights from both behavioral
science and social robotics when you
place Modi in your home or office every
time you walk by he becomes an instant
reminder to keep committed each time you
do your habit Modi is there to help you
track and celebrate your small wins
giving you that immediate gratification
the better you get the more excited for
details but slack off and Modi might get
angry or sad or stay purely encouraging
Modi knows what works best for you
because he's connected to the web he's
constantly analyzing and evolving so he
knows how you're progressing if you're
at risk of falling off and when to send
the right types of nudges specifically
for you compare all this to the same
daily push notification you keep
ignoring so how can something so simple
actually change your behavior to tell
you about how we form good habits let's
start with something that we're all
familiar with forming a bad habit boo
cookie
fundamentally your brain needs three
things to form a habit a trigger a
routine and a reward when I saw that
plate of cookies I didn't even think
about grabbing my brain immediately
triggered me and I knew that eating that
cookie would reward me with its sweet
doughy deliciousness your brain forms
good habits in just the same way by
completing this loop over and over again
modi works by seamlessly integrating
these three elements into your busy
lifestyle modi himself is a trigger more
specifically what's known as an
environmental cue and by using modi your
habit is already set up to be small
distinct and actionable finally movie
celebrations provide an immediate reward
he makes sure that you feel satisfied
and accomplished each and every time and
perhaps a bit guilty if you're not Moniz
the outcome of over a year of human
centered design and engineering rigor we
discovered that triggers and rewards
driven by emotion are far more potent
than numbers lists or alarms now we're
finally ready to release movies straight
to you the only question is what habit
William Ford
when we can't help you magically climb
Mount Everest or run a marathon
overnight he's there to help you do
something more essential become a better
you one habit at a time but we need your
help please back us and be a part of
bringing Modi to life
