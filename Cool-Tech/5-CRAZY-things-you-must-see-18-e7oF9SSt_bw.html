wearing a watch means more than just
telling time i use my morning rides to
clear my mind and crystallize my
thoughts when it comes to watch design
they say stay within the structure don't
go out there it's the unknown to
innovate you must push yourself beyond
belief to get to the other side and when
you do it's amazing my name is Chad I'm
the co-founder of live Swiss watches
like you the watch lover we're always
hungry for something different something
that stands out not just another round
watch introducing the rebel and the name
says it all we wanted an exceptional
look made from better parts at a fair
price the case is machined out of a
single piece of 316l stainless steel and
has some amazing edges it's curved for
comfort and features a genuine sapphire
crystal front and back like all live
washes the eye-popping multi-layered
I'll brings time to life in the
tradition of fine swiss watchmaking the
fifth finish and construction are simply
superb standing behind our timepieces is
key all of our watches are fully backed
by our five year international warranty
every rebel will be individually
numbered as a limited edition which
means that once we sell that model it
will be gone forever we're also
redefining the word brand live is about
having that direct and personal
connection with our fans besides why
should you be forced to pay three times
the actual market price just because of
some middleman
we need your backing to bring the rebel
to life and in turn you will receive one
or more than one of these truly
innovative watches so please back us and
join the revolution be part of the
thousands of happy backers from our tube
past campaigns we look forward to you
flaunting your limited edition rebel so
don't miss out
sound is arguably the most important of
the census it conveys emotion tell
stories and helps us navigate our wall
while we can only see what is directly
in front of us we can hear everything
from all around all of the time when was
the last time your headphones made you
feel like you were actually they're not
just identifying the sound but feeling
transported that's the sound you want
you to hear I'd like to introduce you to
the Asik x Asik x headphones combine
advanced 3d audio algorithms with head
tracking and individual anatomy
calibration to create incredibly
realistic 3d sound headphones haven't
changed a lot in the past 65 years the
mission in Asik is to take the final
leap from reproduced audio to something
that's indistinguishable from reality
our founding team has a passion for
audio we have a combined 50 years of
experience designing some of the top
selling gaming headphones and speakers
on the market our mission is to change
the way people hear sound oh my god it's
so it's so different it's like a movie
theater experience Leslie yeah hey
sounds everywhere was it was awesome oh
I don't think everywhere anything like
that before in real life sound comes
from everywhere and the way you hear the
world is unique only to you it's based
on your position in space the size of
your head even the shape of your ears
but with traditional and even surround
sound headphones these elements are not
taken into account in effect you are
removed from the sound equation this
makes for an incredibly small audio
experience where Psalms can only come
from a few places instead of anywhere
the Asik x is the world's first
headphone that instantly calibrates to
the listener creating the ultimate 3d
listening experience you can be on a
train and have the same experience you
had hearing the concert from the best
seats in the house we can now transport
you to the highest end theater that has
a full array of speakers so you feel
like you were at the movies when you put
them on hi my name is time ah Taylor I'm
the CEO of THX for the first time in my
life I was able to actually experience
sound outside of being the center of my
head and in a natural sound field that
expanded about several feet in front and
behind and above me it was really
revolutionary in virtual reality is all
about immersion it's about transporting
you to another world Asik X will allow
you to accurately hear the sounds
anywhere in the full sphere and it's
going to be crucial in virtual reality
to help direct your attention and create
an incredibly immersive experience that
ties in with the visuals to create the
ultimate presence I was is so real yeah
I can see what the fuss is about how the
audio effects ended up messing perfectly
with what i was seeing an all seek is
really bringing a whole new element here
because if you have 3 16 in massive
sound and it's a more powerful feeling
of being there it's intelligence now
Asik X is going to change the way we
game we bring a whole new level of
accuracy to hearing sounds anywhere in
space not just around us we also have
the ability to unlock the sounds above
us and below us you get the feeling that
you've been teleported into the game
from a visual standpoint when you're
playing the game it gets really intense
and so having like accurate audio cues
to go with it can be just as important
being able to know where someone is
behind a wall or how close someone is if
they're about to turn a corner then you
can put a price on that like and you
know it costs you a game so after
listening to the ausick headphones seems
like they've given me an accurate
representation with 3d audio that I've
never had before communication is
important in gaming the Asik x
headphones use a 3d microphone array
with beamforming to give you the same
noise rejection you would get with a
boom but unlike a boom ensure that your
voice level is always consistent the key
to creating an accurate and realistic
sound experience is knowing the
listeners individual auditory anatomy
and how it influences the way we hear
sound this is called an HR TF or head
related transfer function in order to
create this instant calibration we've
incorporated sensors into the headphone
and we take the information from the
sensors and feed it into software and we
have an adaptive algorithm that
customizes
be back for the individual wearing the
headphone additionally we have multiple
drivers within the headphone that can
beam the sound around the ear and so we
can have the sound naturally interact
with the ear the way it normally would
by taking the intelligence of the
adaptive algorithm and the physical
hardware that's interacting with you
able to create a personal experience
that's unique to you the headphones
feature a uniform headband design and
high quality lightweight aluminum
construction it's unbreakable they have
been designed for durability acoustic
quality and comfort for prolonged
periods of use they can form perfectly
to the user's Anatomy featuring soft
over the ear pads and a revolutionary
micro adjust Erica it's taken our team
numerous prototypes and years of
research to package components necessary
for accurate 3d audio into a high
fidelity and durable headphone with a
design ready we've secured manufacturing
partners who are experienced in
production of high-quality audio
products now we are excited to get 3d
audio into your hands we know that
there's a huge gap between what's
currently available for 3d sound and
what's possible that's why we started
asik we want to bring this technology to
life we want to put it in the hands of
content creators gamers VR enthusiasts
audio files together we can shape the
future of audio

we've all been there you're traveling on
a plane a train or even a bus and you
see them you know who I'm talking about
you have the head bobber that person
that just can't seem to keep their head
up next the determined conversationalist
that person that will not stop talking
to you when all you really want to do is
catch some z's there's also the
accidental Cutler and of course you have
the space invader that person that has
their stuff everywhere there are
countless travel pillows on the market
today but none of them quite get the job
done they're either too big and bulky
don't give enough support for your head
and neck irritate the skin too much work
to inflate and deflate or too small and
quite frankly useless finally there's a
pillow that solves each of these
problems we call it the duo the ultimate
travel pillow and we packed in nine
features that will get you to your
destination rested and relaxed the duo
allows you to wear the pillow and four
unique positions depending on how you
prefer to rest the first position is the
shoulder pads which allows you to wear
it like a traditional neck pillow that
wraps around the back of the neck and
provides additional support between your
shoulders and the seat the second is the
beard this gives that bobbing head of
yours a break the duo design carries the
weight of your head just lay your chin
on the bridge portion of the pillow then
there's the bear hug if you like to lean
forward on the tray table or the sea in
front of you then the bear hug is for
you by flipping the pillow vertical it
provides a wedge shape to support your
head and neck finally there is a field
goal by slipping the duo with the
supports pointing upward it allows your
head to be nestled between the supports
while still allowing your head to
back being travellers ourselves we know
that space always comes at a premium so
we've designed the duo as a compact
inflatable pillow with our patented wide
mouth inflation valve you can literally
get the dual blown up in two breaths no
more huffing and puffing on the standard
tiny valve it also deflates in just a
few seconds the bladder of the duo is
wrapped in a soft touch microfleece
imagine cuddling up with your favorite
blanket with the duo's removable hood
you can give yourself the privacy you
want or even send a message here over
talkative neighbor the hoods adjustable
strings allow you to get as cozy or as
dark as you wish it can also be used in
any of the four pillow position the soft
touch micro fleece is removable making
it simple to throw in the wash to get
rid of those drool stains we all do it
on the outside of the pillow we've
included a small pocket that can be used
to keep your phone or other valuables
close by no more digging through the
seat pocket in front of you to change a
song or having it fall out of your lab
when unexpected turbulence occurs you
may be thinking cool features but does
the pillow actually work don't take it
from us we show the pillow to these
travelers and here's what they had to
say I like it I should like it hold your
head in a neutral position no matter
what because you have these top parts um
nice big opening to refill I like this a
lot better than mine cuz uh the thing in
the back is just it's real skinny so I
don't feel like my head is like for
trying to sleep I like that you can use
it in different ways um obviously the
first side with the with my neck up
against the back and then this way is
another good way to use it cuz I sleep
with my head forward like this a lot on
the plane and this keeps it propped up
so that I'm not like all the way down on
my chest with my experience with
traveling with a pillow my neck just
kind of gets crunched up in the corner
and I like that this will hold your head
up right and I like that it just has
lots of different ways that you can get
comfy on an airplane because you know
that's one of the hardest things to be
able to do we're so confident
a product that if this is not the best
travel pillow that you've ever owned
we'll take it back no questions asked
backer project today so you can arrive
to your final destination rested and
relaxed

this is John while his neighbor is
yelling about how his dog ate his paper
this is John in the same situation using
brick so what is brick so it's an
awesome version of building blocks that
makes your designs come to life with
electricity sensors and Bluetooth let's
see some prototypes from our testing lab
closing a circuit this is Bluetooth
sound sensor light sensor proximity
sensor how amazing is using brick so
this is Kate making her morning coffee
while discovering Roy used all the milk
for his cereal this is Kate same
situation with brick cell brick so has
three types of locks connectors action
blocks and trigger vlogs use the
connectors to make a circuit then embed
the action box to give your design light
or movement now you can use trigger
blocks to control your design with sound
proximity and light Rick so can also be
controlled remotely which means you can
connect your design to your phone and
even to the Internet and automate stuff
if you're into that sort of thing but
who likes to automate stop right oh and
there's a battery block which well is
the battery here's Mike while his
coworker turns off the air conditioner
even though it is 90 degrees outside
this is Mike same situation with brick
so you can use brick so to upgrade
designs made with regular building
blocks which will make them like a
hundred times cooler no wires needed a
break so block components are built in
brick so is also an amazing educational
tool for your kids but know that they'll
forever mock regular building blocks
buzz and Amir have been working on break
so for a long time they're both
physicists so they know a thing or two
about electricity so if you like
building stuff and don't mind getting
addicted support them and get your own
brick so it'll change your life or just
make you happy
