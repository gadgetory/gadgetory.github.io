we believe that simplicity is of utmost
importance to our well-being useless
applications a design should not
distract them essential functionalities
stress your eyes or challenge physical
conditions for this reason we have
created the most innovative hybrid
SmartWatch available on the market

affordable price for our straps we use
the highest quality materials like
genuine American Halloween leather and
other organic materials all
traditionally crafted
sequent is a SmartWatch with the mission
to enhance your life quality making your
everyday life simpler efficient and
unique my inspiration has been to
combine the best of our Swiss heritage
in traditional watch making with the key
features of a SmartWatch to persuade the
majority of consumers adopting our world
ball technology we wanted to create a
world without compromises the one that
is desirable and will be accepted and
word by majority of consumers Z time
will provide a 30 days battery on a
single charge and a water resistant up
to 30 meters when we first started
working on the z10 project we knew from
day one that the most critical challenge
for us would be to offer users the
opportunity to keep track of the daily
time without necessarily having to turn
on the display and therefore have some
battery life issues this has been
accomplished with the time the perfect
hybrid SmartWatch it combined the best
of both worlds stainless steel watch
case and mechanical hands of an elegant
traditional timepiece with a full-color
touchscreen
that instantly shows incoming calls
smartphone notification real time
fitness activity accounting calendar
events daily reminders and much more
right from your wrist the best way to
deliver make any cold hands experience
with a SmartWatch was actually to use
real ones but how and how to make the
background of the traditional watch
becoming smart while drinking a hole
into a TFT display was the only solution
we spent countless hours with our
engineering team an industrial partner
finding the right solution to create a
brand-new touchscreen that could accept
a pass through mechanical health
solution and we finally did it over
hundreds of prototypes and design
proposal by combining a revolutionary
TFT color display together with ultra
precise touch panel and a high-grade
quality glass we succeed to deliver the
best of both worlds
an amazing SmartWatch that can offer
both doctrine experience together with
the traditional timepiece what we didn't
stop here with our Hanoi s we can tweak
the lowest level features to improve
power consumption in addition this house
comes with lot of Princeton applications
and the white Surrey looked nice which
faces while using a traditional quartz
movement when we live into a brand new
smart work we work on gently with
several partners to create what we call
the smart movements built around two
micro motors this movement is capable of
not only providing accurate time but it
can more importantly be controlled by
the watch CPU to automatically adjust
time depending on times on where you are
and also move the ends where we need
them to be on a particular screen as a
result know if you are having hands
covering the text on your emails or
messages we can position them the way we
want to deliver the best reading
experience and they will go back to
their original position of the match
