sweeter our story started years ago when
I adopted a dog from a local no-kill
shelter I wanted to make sure he was
getting proper exercise lots of
socialization and sniffing a variety of
things so I built an activity tracker
and slapped it on him on a walks around
the city but looking at a sad face every
time I left for work I realized he
didn't need more tracking he needed more
time with his best friend I can't be
with him all the time but playdate is
the next best thing late it isn't just
another dog toy it's a great new way for
pet owners to stay connected with her
