water has a density of about one gram
per cubic centimeter
aerogel has a density of 0.0 0.0 one six
grams per cubic centimeter it's about 95
percent air yet it's quite rigid and you
might be able to hear when I drop it on
the tabletop and it's it's quite
transparent this material is used to
insulate the Mars exploration Rovers
used by NASA on that spacecraft very
good insulator very low density
it was very weird like with this on the
scale of one sort of weirdness has comes
out quadrant a3 is it the blood asan a
strange machine you asked did you offer
I asked that no it's not this stuff is
very odd it's called a ferrofluid or a
magnetic liquid and what's happening
here is a magnet down there and a bolt
the magnetic field has been traveled
channeled through and the liquid is is
reacting to the mountain feel that's
really odd not many liquids do that
after this liquids got tiny
nanoparticles magnetite in it normally
if you put that kind of particle inner
in a water solution they'll just get
ripped out by the men in the field in
this case has been coated with a
surfactant and that's the factory the
interface with the water which loves the
water so they're held into the water and
that makes the liquid behave as if it's
magnetic it's called along with the
particle and so it's kind of challenging
these different shapes that all define
by that magnetic field so you can you
can confine a liquid with a magnetic
field just by putting these tires on
magnetic particles in there so the
nanotechnology and it's kind of most
beautiful
Carmine's bachelors have used it because
you in a way what you can do is you can
kind of confine a liquid and make it
either biscuits or quite running with
just controlling an electromagnet and
that means you can make those car
suspensions either very hard or very
soft that with touch of a button now
that sounds like quite a cool
application I agree but I think we can
tell with knowing better although
personally I haven't yet except for the
bolts it's pretty cool
new rule
okay today I'm going to be showing you
some self pouring liquid so this liquid
I have here is called polyethylene
glycol it has a molecular weight of
about a million compare that to water
that has a molecular weight of about 18
so normally what happens if you pour
liquid out like water start pouring you
tilt it back up is soft this stays about
the same level it obviously doesn't keep
pouring out when you pour it that's
because all the little water molecules
all those h2o molecules they're not
really linked together because they're
so small so as soon as you stop pouring
these molecules down here can't pull any
other ones out the polyethylene glycol
has a much higher molecular weight so it
has very very very long chains of
molecules on here and they're all mixed
together like spaghetti in there and it
still just looks like a liquid but on
the molecular scale there's very long
chains of molecules in there all linked
together and so what that does is if you
pour the liquid the liquid that has
already come out starts pulling the
other liquid out and it just keeps
pulling it and it essentially pours
itself okay tilt it a little get it
started
should just pull itself out after that
there we go that's so cool
so even if you just barely pour it just
keeps coming out look at that just up
and over the end of it so the other cool
thing that happens with polyethylene
glycol is if you spin a stick in it it
climbs the stick see how it came up yeah
I again I am enough I made all the way
to the top there so another reason you
might have heard of polyethylene glycol
is because it's also a laxative so got
to make sure I don't drink any of this
so the consistency of this stuff is just
like mucus it's really weird to handle
so normally this stuff is just clear but
I put blue food coloring in this you
could see it better
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
