butts when we leave for the day that's
where petty comes in so you can keep the
fun going and go it and use the app to
drive it remote you interact with your
pack even when you're not there with a
frame pay from durable polycarbonate
have you can go anywhere easily share
footage on social media and keep your
pet gasps and with built-in lasers
that's will ugh daddy wanna play
one of the struggles for medics on a
battlefield is controlling severe
bleeding before X that existed medics
would take a gauze product and they
would have to pack it deep into a severe
arterial wound at the heart of X dot are
these small expanding sponges and the
way they work is that they're a dry
compressed sponge that we cut and make
them real small so they're these discs
like shapes about the size of an aspirin
tablet and when you inject those into a
bleeding wound once they come into
contact with the blood they rapidly
expand and in doing that they fill up
the the wound they're able to compress
it and essentially block the bleeding
and we knew that the applicator is
actually the interface between the
dressing and the actual user the first
responder that's going to be using to
device and I think we felt early on that
if we didn't get that experience right
if we didn't get the ergonomics right if
we didn't get the user experience in
terms of their interaction with the
applicator correctly then you may not
get the adoption of the device and
frankly it can impair the efficacy of it
red medics came to it they were looking
for design partner to help them take
this idea that they had and a solution
they felt was really novel was going to
make a difference in the field and go
from that to a production right design
it must you know be small must be light
it must fit into x y&amp;amp;z pouches on a body
armor in the end what they're really
doing is taking this extremely broad set
of requirements and turning them into
what to an end user just looks like a
really simple solution what the medics
wanted was a new hyuna static agent they
wanted a product that was a
fire-and-forget haemostatic tool that
dometic would come up to our casually
with severe bleeding take the X dad
applicator slip it into the wound easily
inject the product and the bleeding just
thought that was the concept and that's
what we gave the medics
value of the exact device is that in the
end it really is a very simple solution
to when it previously been in an
unsolved problem what an amazing city I
need to write about this place did you
ever miss a flash of creative genius
well you're definitely not alone I need
to bring Jessica here she would love
