you
you
did you know that 65% of people around
the world are visual thinkers people who
love to write and sketch and make notes
we seek the simplest possible way to
plan our lives but haven't figured out
how to put events from our paper
planners into digital calendars while
searching for the best visual way to
plan we chose the circular diagram
because it looks like a clock face and
it takes less effort to focus on what's
going to happen and when it's going to
happen
so we designed the slice planner the
undated handcrafted paper planner made
from all natural materials and premium
Swedish paper and developed an app that
merges paper events with your favorite
digital calendars how would you like a
paper planner that enables reminders
invites and locations synched on all
your devices that's what the app does
it's easy to use and it's powered by
Google Cloud vision for optical
character recognition like that
even if someone just scheduled a meeting
in your digital calendar but you don't
want to merge your events from physical
planner into it we've got you covered
our app has an augmented reality mode
that shows whether you have any
conflicts and events so that you can
resolve them after all there's only one
you who can't be in two places at once
we know you love to make notes sketches
or mind maps covering the whole page
with markings slice planner lets you
sort what data to save simply by drawing
a line around it of any shape on any
surface if you want to quick share your
ideas just mark the corresponding icon
below alternatively you can share a
slice or attach a whole page to an
all-day event whether used as a
standalone planner with various designs
or together with our app slice planner
will provide flexibility that wasn't
there before
all great achievements have one small
thing in common
a measure
you
mentioning
hi we're instrument and we are craftsmen
of product team here has built some
really cool products over the years but
today we're launching something really
close to our heart natural reaction to
modernizing measurement would be to just
add technology to a tape or a ruler but
we don't have the same mechanical
constraints and we certainly don't use
them in the same way we can do a heck of
a lot better we build 0 1 into an
elegant writing instrument 3 to be exact
10 pencil stylus these are things you
likely have in your bag or purse we
built it for designers for architects
for engineers or craftsmen makers and
even those simply putting up pictures we
wanted to do want to be honest it's it's
a measuring instrument but also to
writing instrument so that 0 1 is
balanced and feels natural it's a notion
of security tips path 1 7 months
sweating hardness of small parts to
their feet finish building tools
fixtures or to enable an experience
that's natural you just go over animals
and bad you can measure in millimeters
inches whatever suits you lot
search and share results person
receiving Canadian life change units on
the other end you can actually read
scale drawings and roll it over complex
and get the length of material you can
set up a grid or even just get a rough
measure without checking your phone I
really love measuring my niece Abby and
seeing the way she's growing throughout
the months I can share it directly on
Facebook it's kind of like doorframe
measurement but for the 21st century
isn't it
we've designed the zero one engineered
it tested it and set up manufacturing
we're days away from being able to ship
but what's more we've hidden a few gems
inside you see zero one is a dynamically
evolving instrument this is where we
need your help over the next few months
the team here will be creating
functionality that will enrich how we
think about dimensioning if you back us
now not only will we ship zero one in
pen pencil and stylus form it will give
us fuel to keep releasing features that
redefine how we capture and use
dimensions and bring them right to the
devices we've shipped back us today and
we'll start shipments December 1st
hi I'm bar and I'm Hannah
in 2014 I ran a successful Kickstarter
campaign for the make smith cnc today
I'm super excited introduce you to our
new project Mazda Mazda was a 4x8 foot
CNC cutting machine designed to change
the way we build everything from art
projects to houses and it's cheap you
can get one now for under $500 Masel
lets you print the things you can find
around new that are made from wood this
could be anything from furniture to the
world's coolest treehouse to rebuilding
after a natural disaster we wanted to
create a game-changing tool which allows
people from around the world to
digitally collaborate to make amazing
things we wanted to create a tool which
is cheap easy to use inclusive and
powerful basically we want to help you
build cool stuff to make that possible
we knew we had to make a machine which
work with materials and their native 4x8
form without taking up your entire
garage or workshop it needed to be
affordable
both to purchase and to ship it had to
be easy to assemble with no soldering no
programming and no fancy tools it needed
to be just as accurate as a person using
power tools even when cutting complex
shapes our solution masa masa uses gear
reduced DC motors with encoders and a
closed-loop feedback system to achieve
high accuracy and high torque more
details for nerds can be found below
Maslow stands only 19 inches out from
your garage or shop wall leaving plenty
of space to park the car Maslow comes as
an easy-to-assemble kit which includes
every piece of hardware you need except
for two bricks two sheets of plywood and
three two by fours we couldn't get those
to fit in the box also if you don't
already own one you'll need to purchase
a fixed base router maslow can be put
together in a weekend using only a
Phillips screwdriver a pair of pliers
and a handsaw maslow connects to your
Mac Windows or Linux computer using a
standard USB port excited for your first
project pledge now to reserve your
maslow cnc can't believe it read and
learn tons more about the project below
building things digitally is the future
and we believe it should be for everyone
this is an important technology and
we're making the choice not to patent it
all of our designs PCB layouts firmware
and software are available for free
right now on our web site to anyone in
the world
when you design something to print
whether it's a kayak a tiny house or
light aircraft we encourage you to do
the same and share your digital files so
anyone
check out our videos and content below
to learn how easy it is to assemble your
kit and to find out how to turn your
digital files into real-world objects
and most importantly build something
amazing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
