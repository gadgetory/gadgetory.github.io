old watch we rely heavily on technology
to keep us connected and productive in
our daily lives and a dead phone battery
could be costly the you volt watch is
our way of solving this problem in a way
that also helps preserve the environment
the watch is equipped with a solar panel
that passively captures energy from the
Sun that energy is then stored inside a
removable compact power reserve under
ideal light conditions watches power
reserve could reach its full capacity
within a day low battery
just pull out the power reserve from the
watch and start charging your mobile
device we are also including a wireless
charging dock if you need to start your
day with a full charge simply place the
watch on the dock and will fully charge
in under 45 minutes to save energy the
dock only uses power when a device is
placed on it and automatically turns off
when it reaches full charge the power
aim with the you volt watch was to
create a simple yet highly functional
object it's minimal lines and analog
interface makes it an easy fit for any
wardrobe it is meant to be a comfortable
and personal everyday companion that
supports our values as well as our
mobile lives we chose a mechanical watch
instead of digital because it would draw
less power while providing precise time
the watch hands have a minimal width to
maximize the performance of the solar
panel which covers the entire face of
the watch it is also covered with a thin
sheet of anti reflective mineral glass
to further enhance the solar capacity
the power reserve combines a custom
circuit that handles the electrical flow
of the watch with a high density lithium
ion battery the reserve has an
integrated Lightning port for Apple
devices or microUSB B and C for Android
devices it could even go entirely
wireless the charging wire stays inside
the power reserve so it's virtually
impossible to forget or
at the bottom sits the wireless receiver
for inductive charging through the
included dock it all fits in a durable
aluminum body and on top of that we
filled the band with batteries to add
more capacity allowing a second charge
after the power reserve has been used to
achieve this addition we developed the
custom hinge that lets current go back
and forth within the body of the you
volt watch today we need your support to
bring this project to life and together
step into a sustainable and accessible
future what if you could turn back time
and relive the best memories of your
life like see your daughter's first
steps again watch your son's first
baseball hit again or simply experience
the best family vacation you've ever had
again
meet teleport an entirely new way to
capture and relive the best memories of
your life through the power of virtual
reality technology to capture those
special moments simply plug the teleport
camera in your phone and start shooting

teleport camera has two lenses that work
the same way our eyes see the world it
captures everything you see in 3d

there and experience those unforgettable
living memories again
