and evening Calculon as you drift off
into a peaceful and restful sleep
i was born in the pastoral countryside
of heaven on earth it was a peaceful and
beautiful land as a child I was orphaned
early on and at the end of the day I lay
down to sleep on our porch under a
canopy of stars sparkling and twinkling
until the break of the morning today I'm
able to bring to the world the beauty of
my everlasting evening sky through
starsailor it's only through my
never-ending dedication that I'm now
able to bring everyone the chance to
sleep with the stars of the night to the
moment that we drift off to rest our
minds and our
you
this is John he is an experienced
motorcycle rider John knows that safety
is important which is why he at least
where's this and this and of course this
but what if you could prevent an accent
altogether well things that's Jane hi
Jane and this is break free just like
John she too is an experienced writer
and she's all about safety she knows
that being visible at all times is the
key it's a smart LED light that does
sophisticated things unlike your
motorcycle tail light breakfree is at
eye level so false drivers can see it'll
grow brighter to alert drivers around
you when you're slowing down no matter
how breaking down shifting or engine
brake turn it on and it stays on no need
to connect it with wires or use an app
and that's what jane and riders really
care about being seen to prevent an
accident in the first place whether
you're this this this or even this kind
of writer you'll still want this this
bridges the gap between safety and style
this is break free a smarter way to be
seen I've been writing for the past 10
years and I loved every second of it i
also have a wife and two beautiful
daughters so my safety is always my top
priority shortly after i graduated
college I got the opportunity to
apprentice under a successful Silicon
Valley entrepreneur while working on one
of those new ideas and autonomous brake
lights cars I quickly realized this is
the perfect product for motorcycle
riders so if break free we're trying to
use advanced manufacturing techniques
from companies like Audi and BMW and
bring those to the consumer market to
deliver a safety product that is like no
other one of the biggest hurdles for the
design process was trying to make our
units fit on as many how much as
possible and the way we did this as we
took many houses we could get and we 3d
scan the back of them
and what we're trying to get at is a
shape that's going to work for as many
as possible and also maximize the
surface area of the light because the
surface area life is obviously important
and how much you can see them products
that have been on the market already our
own mounted takes on a vehicle that
works well and can detect acceleration
but as soon as that the head of the
writer start moving a lot of these
devices give false readings what's
special about the break free device is
that we can detect deceleration in the
direction of travel even though the head
of the writer where the light is mounted
may move sideways and tilt forward the
end goal at break free is to increase
safety for writers we did that in two
ways first create a device that people
will want to wear and the second make
something that works one of the most
important aspects of our safety is our
visibility and it's also one of those
things that's most neglected currently
in the market there's some high vis gear
that's neither in the helmet or a vest
or in pants and to me I mean it's
definitely a step in the right direction
but they're a static piece they're not
going to really get the attention
they're not going to really capture kind
of a semi glazed driver if you will
what's nice about this product is it
illuminates and flashes so it's
something that is dynamic and it
definitely can make a difference between
saving the life breakfree is something
that's really unique never seen anything
like it before cars have a triangle of
life these days modern cars the two
taillights the light that's up in the
back window motorcyclists taillights are
generally small and they're designing
them to look even cooler and smaller and
they become even harder to see the break
free brings a light that is going to be
noticeable by drivers up into their
basic field of vision this is why
briefly needs to exist breakfree is
bridging the gap between style and
safety I dedicated the last two years of
my life get break free to where it is
and this is where we need your help now
we need the tooling to manufacture our
first large order we get break free into
the hands of writers everywhere thank
you
