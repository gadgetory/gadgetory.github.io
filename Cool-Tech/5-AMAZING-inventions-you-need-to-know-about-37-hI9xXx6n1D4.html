master your foot and an assessment at
the mobile industry today we are here to
introduce protect type the invisible
protection for all glass surfaces we
made a products for every room of let's
start at the beginning our idea came
from everyday experiences such as this
one lunch with your best mate we talked
about your studies Netflix your date
last night and how awful it went when
you go to check your notification we
notice that your screen has been damaged
since the last time you looked at it and
that's what cific feeling is something
pretty much all of us can relate to and
every time of the hundreds of times if
you look at your device each day you'll
feel it again this is one of the key
experiences that we set out to fix with
protect tax would it not be great its
scratch screens where a thing of the
past let's now move on to another
everyday example you are sitting in a
cafe with your colony going over the
latest sales numbers in situations such
as these whether it be because you don't
pay attention or because you go to hand
over a pen it is quite possible the
disaster strikes
bill you know that sinking feeling in
your chest when you still liquid over
your cell phone we do too now consider
if it's just lost all your pictures and
videos well consider this even simpler
case you're in a hurry takin incoming
phone call you place yourself on between
head and shoulder you guessed it the
phone drops did you know around twenty
percent of people continue using their
cell phones despite its broken screen
they don't want to spend upwards of two
hundred dollars curry care as the saying
goes new ideas and products are
solutions to problems we all face now
these have been a few of the examples of
all the experience that we took into
consideration when designing protect tax
let's take a step back rewind and have a
look to see how project tax may have
been able to help in these examples once
you apply project packs let it dry is
practically becomes one with your device
you can see it and that's the point but
you have just added an extremely strong
layer to device that protects it from
scratches another great feature is the
so-called load of these things once you
apply project packs the device and it's
fully hardened out liquid are going to
fall off your device a lot faster than
normal but drastically due to the
chances of liquids getting caught in the
electronics and causing damage so this
doesn't mean we just waterproof your
device but the chances of survival are
increased by a large margin another big
deal of protech pack is the fact that
show to devise fall onto its screen the
chances for a break a reduced
drastically the most popular method
today to protect your screen are the
soil screen protectors that are a hassle
to put on and look like crap a few days
later you can toss those aside and just
follow these easy steps step 1 clean
your screen with the wet tissue number
one to empty the protector packs
cartridge onto the middle of your screen
use your finger to spread it across the
whole front give it 10 minutes to dry
then these different numbers three apply
a clean finish improved touch screen
functionality water repelling properties
and an increased scratch resistant
take on the challenges of everyday life
this is the way that cell phone
protection should look like in the 21st
century you cannot just use protect tax
on your cell phones but also on your
tablet screens glasses cameras any
surface that needs protection we cannot
get pro tech packs to market justify

meet ping the world's smallest GPS
locating device it's tiny so you can
stick it on your kids your pets your
bike your luggage or anything important
you don't want to lose it can be found
miles away and last up to five months on
a single charge there are a lot of
tracking devices out there that are
supposed to make it easy to find things
but most of us aren't using them why
because Bluetooth devices only work
within 35 feet of your phone you can't
find your kids that they're playing
outside or your luggage if it's lost
halfway across the country and these GPS
devices which have a much larger range
are big clunky need to be constantly
recharged and has large monthly fees
ping is reinventing the locating device
Bluetooth cellular and GPS for maximum
range extremely long battery life
waterproof and durable all together in a
tiny affordable versatile solution one
more thing ping is the only device with
a little check-in button that lets your
kids spend their locations to friends or
family with a simple push and if they're
in trouble they can hold that button
down to send you a distress signal so
that health can be contacted ping is the
first truly useful affordable and dazzle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
