with an active lifestyle those who carry
a backpack those who ride subway those
who ride their bike commuting to work
those who are adventurous growing up in
Colorado I found the real passion for
the natural world I want to live healthy
I want to eat healthy I want to have
that food with me all the time we've
made a reusable container that you can
take everywhere with you it's super
convenient it's wonderful to have and
it's worth its weight when you carry
around the majority of trash that I
create is from food waste wax cardboard
styrofoam plastic things that get thrown
away it's all packaging I want to do
everything I can to prevent the natural
world from being stuffed with trash what
does it mean to live in a world where
we're conscious about the way we create
waste there are ways to reduce it we
developed a product that doesn't break
easily is dishwasher safe and food safe
is approved by all the science
foundations for food and it can clip
easily to your backpack so it makes it
highly portable it holds 33 ounces
that's a big enough meal for any size
and shape I look forward to how
convenient it can be to have home-cooked
food anywhere
I tried at first carrying food in for
instance Tupperware I constantly look
around for a container that won't leak
and none of them fit that bill they
always have some amount of liquid coming
out of them the green traveler allows
you to carry delicious healthy food with
you you can pack any food you want or
non-food items it won't leak it will
keep water out and you have four
compartments to choose from you get to
experience home-cooked food from
anywhere anyone who packs lunch for the
day needs a way to do that without
creating waste the green traveler is
food safe dishwasher safe liquid tight
and you can clip it to your backpack we
see this as the most convenient way to
carry food with you students can take it
to college adults can take it to work it
can be used for food it can be used for
other items as well first aid supplies
mothers can pack all the things their
baby might need go to a food truck or
hot bar without generating any more
wasteful packaging we're providing a
solution for healthy and sustainable
lifestyles we are a team of engineers
and MBAs we have experience taking
businesses out into production so we're
confident if you fund this that we can
watch it we can help change the culture
in the way we consume food we want you
to have a healthy waste free meal
anywhere you are help us raise the
capital for injection moulding so we can
get the green traveler out to everyone
join our campaign to show how much you
care about having a convenient reduced
waste lifestyle

we're rumple and we're completely
obsessed with creating the world's best
blankets we're company that began on
Kickstarter and with your help we've
been able to launch three different
blanket since 2014 this is our best one
yet but first let's see how we got here
earlier this year we were introduced to
two other brands with Kickstarter
success stories Raven and power
practical we all got together and shared
our opinions about crowdfunding business
and design and that's when we had a
really exciting idea you see Raven makes
heated jackets Howard practical makes
batteries and we make blankets we had
all the pieces we needed to completely
reinvent the heated blanket so we made a
plan and got to work we looked at
hundreds of heated blankets from the
past and found that almost nothing had
changed in the last 50 years we studied
shell materials and tested heating
systems we considered temperature gain
seat time cool time storage weight and
washing none of it felt modern we scrap
the old concepts and instead figured out
how to add radiant heating technology
and our practicals battery into our
blankets the end result is the Rumple
puffy and it's the world's most advanced
portable heated blanket
the puffy is a battery-powered heated
blanket that you don't plug into an
outlet a one that you can actually plug
in to it warms you in seconds charges
your devices and can be used as a
lantern or flashlight in three different
lighting modes it's also the first
Kickstarter project that combines three
different technologies that were all
conceived through crowdfunding
it's the perfect companion for travel
comfort and power in your life on the go
the blanket warms up in low medium and
high heat settings with a series of
clicks so you can adjust to a
temperature that suits your needs the
battery can be fully recharged to 90
minutes and can charge your mobile
device up to 4 times you can run for 10
straight hours on a low heat setting six
hours on medium heat and four hours on
high heat if you just want to use it as
a lantern it'll last for over 15 hours
if you're at home and don't want to run
the battery the blanket can also be
plugged directly into an outlet and stay
on forever the puppy features a
water-resistant shell and is available
in both synthetic natural down fill both
versions pack down into a travel ready
stuff sack and are completely machine
washable
by backing this project you will be the
first to receive this revolutionary
heated blanket and help fuel this
partnership so that we can release more
amazing products in the future
the Rumple puppy with radiant technology
the lightest warmest and smartest heated
blanket ever designed
you
at power practical we love high voltage
shooting sparks and lighting up the
party after bringing this Tesla coil too
wide we knew it was time to put one in
everyone's pockets introducing the
sparker a plasma wider and flashlight
and one the flashlight is a 1 watt
dimmable LED second run for four hours
on fulbright the removable lid doubles
as a diffuser transforming the light
into a lantern the plasma lighter uses
electricity to create a windproof
solution that requires no flame butane
or fuel the sparker is great for any of
your outdoor adventures
lighting your barbecue around your house
or simply being prepared
Parker is also USB rechargeable please
back or share our project and light it
up
