you're looking into the eyes of a robot
and he's looking back at you he's
curious about who you are and what
you're up to this is vector this is a
video about vector he's the new creation
from hockey he is a character a robot
that is meant to live in your home he's
always on he's alive the idea is really
that vector becomes part of the family
or that home both on the emotional
character side but then also on the
utility side vector is really the first
robot that uses advanced deep neural
networks to do a lot of perception and
understanding of the world around him
what he does feels intentional he can
react to inputs in his environment in
his life we generally want to find one
defining feature and then build from
that
for vector curiosity was a big one what
they're saying is you officially live in
a time when robots sidekicks are a real
thing it's a step closer to that sci-fi
robot you know that everyone wants to be
friends with that step closer means
you've got a robot in your house waiting
for you to get home
autonomous like a Mars rover aware
enough to avoid Falls like a tightrope
walker and always excited to welcome you
home like a loyal companion vectors no
slouch roommate either he's happiest
when he's helping out ask him the
weather and he'll show you he can set a
timer and cause a commotion when it's
finished
activate robot alarm and he can connect
his robot brain to the Internet to
answer your questions he's a little
robot who brings a lots to your house
there's got to be a huge amount of code
inside the robot there is a huge amount
of code inside the robots a few million
lines of code at this point that
software really encompasses everything
from the character to the low-level
operating system to the cloud
functionality he is your friend
he was built to help and delight and
entertain
you that is delightful and entertaining
so instead of sitting back and waiting
for the robot apocalypse
Hongki is making super smart robots
built to bring joy and companionship to
humans did I mention he likes to be pet
and I know vector is a really big
milestone for robotics because for the
first time ever there will be hundreds
of thousands of people living with a
robot in their homes and that has never
happened before vector is ready to live
in your house or at least he will be
after the snap sweet robot dreams buddy
whether you are in your 20s or 60s an
office worker or an athlete your feet
get strained every day the most common
cause for heel pain is plantar fasciitis
plantar fasciitis is inflammation of the
ligament on the bottom of the foot in
the United States alone more than 3
million people each year will be
diagnosed with plantar fasciitis a
whopping 80 percent of women have foot
problems with plantar fasciitis being
one of the most common causes of their
pain we want to change that so meet high
healer your personal food therapist
it's the most versatile food care device
on the market you can use aa healer
anywhere you want to relieve the pain in
your foot most people that are suffering
from foot pain have plantar fasciitis
the high healer is interesting in that
it now allows us to strengthen the
intrinsic muscles of the foot which we
were unable to do before the high heel
is for anyone who suffer from foot pain
heel pain for example athlete like
runners for people that their weight
create a lot of stress on their feet
people that are on their feet a lot
during the day there are four main
function of the high heel ER first is
the cooling effect of the roller which
helped the inflammation of the plantar
fascia if it has a rounded edge on one
side in a sharp edge on the other the
rounded edge is used for the acute
inflammation where you can't put down as
much pressure on the ligament when
you're pressing and the other side is
the sharper one for the chronic
inflammation which you could push down a
little bit harder it has the benefit of
adding both heat and cold so that if you
have an acute case of plantar fasciitis
you could use the ice if it's a chronic
you could use the heat allow the
ligament to stretch out the second
feature is stretching massaging off the
plantar fascia third function is to
activate the intrinsic muscle within the
foot to help stabilize the foot and
strengthening the foot stepping along
activating the small muscles to actually
fire when these things fire and stretch
and pull it strengthens the bottom of
the foot thereby the ligament that's
being destroyed which is called the
plantar fascia it doesn't have to work
so hard so the muscles will help induce
strengthening and the last function is
to help loosen up the Achilles tendons
the stretching will stretch two types of
muscles bottom of the lake and then a
little bit higher behind the knee
normally it would take you thirty five
minutes or so work through all the
exercises that need to be done but using
the device you can cut that time down to
about 10 to 15 minutes our first
Kickstarter campaign with high polar was
a great success our campaign was funded
by 200
with the help of 1700 amazing beggars
all the backers received their products
within three months the campaign ended
together with our manufacturer we have
already designed the tooling and created
the production plan for high healer now
we need your support to bring this
project to life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
