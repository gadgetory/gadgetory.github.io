bring you the transformer bench the
transformer bench is unique hidden
sliding rails allow you to quickly and
easily extend the length to accommodate
more people and in style beautiful from
all angles
it makes for a trendy piece of interior
design lightweight yet stable and strong
you can be sure that it was made to last
the test of time and to support
multifunctional use for all around your
home and office a beautiful solid wooden
coffee table
a sturdy entry seat or even a storage
space
the transformer bench sits seamlessly

furniture that neatly stores away simply

stunning look in just a few seconds you

wooden bench long enough to seat the
whole family or friends we believe that
the future of furniture is transformer
furniture transform your living with the
comfort convenience and strength of the
transformer bench what are the best
earphones for your game so many choices
today we're gonna try these
this is gamo it's the world's first
earbuds using 3d recutting audio
technology we have four testers
they're gonna play fortnight on
Nintendo's switch what I feel like the
foot staff and explosion was it large
it's almost like someone's behind me
it's just so clear and it just sounds
like it's coming from behind you all
around Jeremy how are the ear buds used
multiple headsets in the past and it
just doesn't even come close to this
I like cliff Lestat and exploded it was
and it's just I'm like right into it
it's just an immersive experience when
you have these on Oh No what the hell
man sorry the director wants us to plug
the products and we only have a certain
amount of time left
what's that
it's a 3d sound positioning system that
helps you locate the source of a sound
in a video game that's not new my
headset can do that too actually they're
not the same for traditional 3d sound
positioning they just separate the
master into three separate frequencies
gamma 3-d recutting audio can separate
different types of key sounds footsteps
gunshots and other surrounding sounds so
you can pinpoint every sound in a 3d
space
gamma has a wider range of traditional
earphones with damo you're able to hear
the locations of your enemies locate the
directions where they come from and even
identify the changes in distance and
with the dual driver system you can
receive a much more accurate sound
location playback so you'll hear every
single detail about your enemies boom so
simple so cool put your headphones on
cuz this is the boo that makes beats
loop and record wherever you are change
sounds and build complex tunes I'll
share it to you you share it to your
friends I move or end up making beats
together
although is precious institution that
means you can control the sounds you
play with the bounce you made and if you
got the skills you can connect more
balls there's no perfect way to play
this you just have to do your own thing
whether you're showing off our side or
you're serious beat maker and one of the
coolest things about it is that you can
add effect to extraction
math is that to do outside go out on the
street
this is awkward the new way of making my
name's Mackenzie I run Mendocino magic
it's a 600-acre campground where we host
a lot of outdoor weddings the one two
three sixty has been a really valuable
resource for us because it helps us to
create virtual tours of our property
with a Street View style approach and it
makes it a lot easier for potential
guests to see what they're getting into
before they get here
being able to click through the property
was huge you know looking at the 360
video tour just set this place apart so
much using virtual tours in advance
helps set us apart from our competition
in this industry I've been playing
Minecraft a lot for the last several
years and recently I got one of the new
Wonder 360 cameras to help me with the
in-game world design I built myself a
rig where I can just strap it onto an
old bike helmet pairs really easily to
my phone once I'm connected I can just
like take it outside into any of the
environments that I'm finding
interesting by the time I get back the
3d point cloud is waiting for me on my
computer and I can turn that file into a
Minecraft world right away the 103 16
has been really helpful as a tool when
we move into new builds and construction
putting the helmet on I was able to walk
around and make sure I knew exactly what
the designer and the architect were
going to see as well as far as the space
and what we were gonna be working with
what was really great about this project
was the property owner handing off a 360
capture where I could see how my design
will fit into the pre-existing landscape
I think that it'll help a lot with other
landowners in the future for their
builds and how they can more sustainably
interact with their spaces and it'll
make a huge difference for us as we
develop more of this property</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
