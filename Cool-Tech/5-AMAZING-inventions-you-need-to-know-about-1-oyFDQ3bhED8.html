studies have found water contamination
is a much more serious issue than
previously thought and governments
around the world and failed
the
you
I
and
you
we've entered the age of personal
manufacturing but when it comes to
making durable things in your own shop
there's still no easy way to cut hard
materials as makers and engineers we
need to work with all materials so we've
built a machine that could the first
desktop waterjet laser works by
combining abrasive particles with the
high-pressure water stream the mixture
exits the nozzle and cuts through the
workpiece it's great for any word show
it cuts every material it's compact and
contains and it's digital so you can
make precise cuts that are impossible to
make any other way as an industrial
designer I've used a variety of desktop
application too but they tend to be very
limited by the durability of the
materials you can use on those machines
but it desktop waterjet we can go from
design to component to fitting that
component and testing within a couple of
hours that's an incredibly powerful tool
as a jeweler and an artist with the work
I make I spend a lot of time hand
cutting so right now I'm selling pieces
sort of as almost limited edition
because I can't physically output them
not because I want to be making in a
limited edition waser would allow me to
not only make a lot more but also to
lower the price point so they'd be
available to a broader audience I think
you know people tend to have their ideas
constrained by their tools and things
are capable of working with and having a
water jet cutter which has the ability
to cut a broader range materials hard
materials like steel and glass will be
enabling and make them think in
different ways and have them build
different things they couldn't build
before
or the future of manufacturing is in
custom local fabrication people will be
able to make things in our own workshop
that they can use every single day and
will last a lifetime as mechanical
electrical and manufacturing engineers
we designed products manufactured
components and set-up assembly lines in
the past now we're preparing for
production but we move enough orders to
produce the machines cost effectively
we've created a unique desktop tool and
we're really looking forward to all the
amazing things that people create with
it
what if you could control your dreams
fly over the Grand Canyon visit a
beautiful island or perhaps go back in
time to the age of dinosaurs now you can
meet I band plus the EEG brain sensing
headband for inducing lucid dreams and
improving sleep what is a lucid dream a
lucid dream is any dream in which you
become aware that you're dreaming
without you actually waking up dreams
occur almost always when you are in the
rapid eye movement phase also known as
the REM phase of your sleep in Rynne
phase your brain activity is different
than in the other phases of your sleep
cycle I Pam + accurately senses this
dream face by monitoring variations in
your brain waves once I've M plus senses
the street phase it plays audio visual
cues
the subtle external stimuli of light
patterns via the LEDs on IBM plus and
sound appear as anomalies in your dream
making you aware that you are dreaming
without them waking you up once you are
lucid in a dream you can take control of
your dream actions and consciously
reshape the dream to fulfill any fantasy
your wildest desires unrestrained by the
laws of physics or society
lucid dreams are vivid and highly
immersive once in lucid dream you enter
a virtual world where everything you see
here touch taste and smell is as
authentic as reality lucid dreaming has
been researched scientifically many
psychologists and researchers have
recognized that lucid dreams can help
with artistic creativity problem-solving
improving sports and language skills and
can even help people prone to nightmares
to get their fears under control sleep
is also very important to restore energy
reserves and strengthen the immune
system even minimal sleep loss affects
mood productivity ability to handle
stress and even body weight iban plus
tracks your sleep indicate sleep quality
and gives feedback on improvement I pen
+ also has the most advanced smart alarm
feature that which you up with simulated
natural sunlight and sounds at the most
optimum period of sleep cycle so that
you wake up fresh every time
i ban plus headband communicates with I
band plus app on your smartphone via
bluetooth so you can conveniently check
your sleep statistics and improvement
suggestions you can even customize your
I've m+ from this app to set LED light
patterns and the brightness as well as
the audio cues developers can use our
open platform to create amazing new
experiences with future software updates
I band plus could be connected to
numerous smart devices in your home to
simplify your daily life dreams and
sleep are waitting for optimal health
and happiness so we started working on
iban plus with the goal to enable
everyone to control their dreams and to
enable everyone to gain insight into
their sleep we went through several
prototypes to realize the best I man +
design we are really excited to take
iban + from the prototyping stage to the
support finished product we want to hear
from you to know your ideas and
improvement suggestions be the words
first to own i ban + back our campaign
and help us make I van plus a reality
thank you
wherever life takes you carry the
perfect back-up plan the portable
versatile tallinn by tactica modern life
presents challenges work sports
adventures small things can easily blow
out and become big Talyn helps keep the
small things small made with an advanced
composite technology and world first
patent pending design the Talon packs 17
tools and features to match in a
pocket-sized carry it comes with metric
and imperial wrenches and rulers box
cutter bottle opener and standard
quarter inch phillips and flathead hack
stripes the talon adapts to your life

allow the Talon is made of one of the
world's most advanced composite
materials forty percent lighter than
titanium and the strength of diecast
metal plus the material tech allows you
to carry your talent without fear of
scratching your latest phone or tablet
the Talon can go anywhere you do and it
complies with current TSA requirements
for air travel the Australian designed
engineered and manufactured Talon
multi-tool by tactica compact enough to
carry everyday lightweight enough not to
weigh you down heavy duty enough to get
things done Talon in your hand enough
said two years ago we bought you tactic
is first crowdfunding campaign the one
bottle opener and now we have our latest
innovation ready for you Talon pushes
the limits with materials technology and
functionality its patent-pending design
is made possible by using an advanced
composite material this makes it super
strong and enables the unique unibody
design that increases strength and
hardness we've also created a dual
purpose storage compartment into the
design to function as a soccer
something that hasn't been possible in a
multi-tool until now we make the talent
in melbourne australia and over the past
few months our team has worked closely
to perfect the design for manufacture
it's great to be involved again with the
same factory that produces our popular
one bottle opener this kind of
collaborations made sure that everyone
involved has a deep understanding of the
project and the high standards we expect
having a local manufacturer also reduces
the risks usually associated with
overseas manufacture now waiting on
shipments faulty products or delivery
delays will be right there in front of
the machine as they come off the line it
doesn't get any more personal than that
importantly tooling has already
commenced yes that's right we've made
the decision to launch straight into the
production process because we reckon
you're going to want one or two in time
for Christmas we're tooling the mods now
and we'll be ready for full-scale
production well before Christmas thanks
for the support and look forward to
getting a talent in your hand soon
the world around us is changing as we
speak and with that change comes a
constant evolution of capturing realizes
GoPro allowed us to be present in this
world recording her beauty while being
there right in the action drones allows
like beautiful steady aerial images from
the sky we combine best of both worlds
and created air air let's should take
aerial videos and photos simply by
throwing your GoPro
you
this is how it works Star Trek or
or connect your GoPro to the remote or
smartphone app now simply snap the GoPro
in slide the two wings into each other
and screw them on to the head you can
start shooting
we have taken air into the forest upon
the mountains out on the water into the
city and this is just the beginning
whatever you would like to record with
your GoPro air will be ready for it are
you more into photos use burst mode and

put air and your GoPro into the bag and
you're good to go
hi guys my name is Mark and I start out
air with a couple of friends almost a
year ago what started out as a fun
experiment to get our Gophers in the air
without use of a drone turn out to be an
amazing experience on its own and the
results they look more alive and dynamic
than ever before the feeling you get
when you freely throw your GoPro in the
air is one that we want to share with
everyone and that's why we are bringing
it to you fast for the past year we
sketch model them prototype till we have
the perfect design and now we are ready
for mass production the manufacturing it
is all done in the Netherlands and we
are ready to go the minute we reach our
goal we are very curious to see what
you're gonna do it there step up your
goal per game and back us today
