we enjoy music - all sorts of devices
and various formats and vinyl takes us
to the core of great sounds a getting
into vinyl can be intimidating and
expensive there are complicated and
expensive audio systems or other
turntable models with small speakers
that may be easy to use but can't even
bring out good sound what if we can fix
all that and have everything we want all
at once
meet speed the all-in-one turntable
system that integrates outstanding sound
quality great output and classic design
equipped with one-inch soak tweeters and
four inch woofer drivers the dynamic
range of seed is increased by 20% so
from subtle gasps to grand orchestra
performances we take you to the front
row of a concert and immerse you
completely in the music the exclusive
suspension design filters out vibrations
and hold the platter and tone arm steady
to deliver consistent high-quality sound
it's like a smooth ride through rocky
terrain with the best suspension system
furthermore to preserve the precious
records and produce the most authentic
sounds we applied eccentric
counterweight Enki skate to balance the
tone arm and keep the stylus riving in
the center of the groove without wearing
out the record unevenly
just like how we enjoy vinyl seed is
also about the aesthetics the steam vent
wood frame is a visualization of sound
waves it sounds good looks good and
feels good this is the final experience
built just for you

required to perfectly cook your steak

guesswork when you pan fry at home it's
difficult to nail the temperature that's
precisely a difference of just five
degrees makes or breaks your food this
is even difficult for restaurants to do
but with cinder you nail it every time
what I'm showing you here is exactly
what your steak will look like all I did
was set cinder to my desired doneness
place the steak inside and wait 30
minutes for cinder to beep it knows when
the food is reached temperature as a
final step I cranked cinder up to four
to 50 degrees for a quick sear to
caramelize the exterior that makes it
look and taste exactly like this in some
sense it's just a regular frying pan
except with precise temperature control
but wow that precise temperature control
makes over the difference we make salmon
that melts in the mouth and you know
thick porkchop Kozak I never cooked
before because it dried out while we put
it in the center and it's perfect
steaks perfect it gives you the
precision of Scooby but with the
convenience of microwave cooking
anything you can put into a normal grill
you can put into cinder and not only
cinder is easy to use as a normal grill
