strike hard to be someone now
you
well nowadays people take thousands of
pictures with your cell phones but they
never look at them so we decided to
create an object that will make them
able to share pictures with their
friends and family in a tangible way
print is the first smartphone case that
prints out pictures instantly you just
have to play your smartphone it's not a
picture and can print instantly we
worked during a year on about 15
different prototypes to come up with one
product that's really easy to use for
example it doesn't use Bluetooth
technology or Wi-Fi you can take a
picture but you can also use pictures
from facebook Instagram any picture that
is already on your smile
my biggest design challenge was to
create and objects that will work with
different type of smartphones who are
compatible with the iphone 5 the iphone
6 and also the galaxy s4 and galaxy s5
and we are trying to bring it to more
smartphones we don't need any ink
cartridge all the ink is already in the
paper you just have to hit it and the
picture will appear like like magic
like I said what we realized but instant
cameras is the whole experience so we
try to capture it by recording your
short videos 56 seconds just before you
take a pictures this video will play
automatically on the paper through
augmented reality when you scan it with
our app
we wanted to go further than just
printing pictures we wanted to bring
memories that you could hold in your
hands and that you could give away
whenever you want it print is for
everybody because everybody likes a
printed picture that you can hold in
your hand you know it's like a memory
that you can get away trees the stoma so
this shake
