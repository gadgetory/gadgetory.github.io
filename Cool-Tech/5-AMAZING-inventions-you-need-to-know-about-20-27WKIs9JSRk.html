we all have a bedtime ritual for most of
us it's never for clear healthier skin
but then we thought about what happens
afterwards why are we laying our fresh
faces onto a pillow case that hasn't
been washed in days it turns out the
average pillow case is a breeding ground
for bacteria in fact studies have shown
that the bacteria found on pillowcases
is no different from that on a toilet
this bacteria builds up over time and
can be harmful to your skin and overall
well-being dermatologists recommend
washing your pillow case every two or
three days who has time for that we sure
don't and we don't know anyone who does
introducing the Sylvan pillow case
Silvan provides you with a clean
sleeping surface each and every night
here's how it works Sylvan uses pure
natural silver prevent bacterial growth
under pillow case advanced technology
now allows us to weave silver coated
thread into our fabric these silver
threads are up to 99 percent effective
in controlling bacteria on your entire
pillowcase the average pillowcase
continues to accumulate bacteria over
time Silvan shows a ninety-nine percent
reduction pathogens within the first
hour and continue to prevent bacterial
growth night after night let's take it
back to high school chemistry silver
carries a positive charge and bacteria
is negative the solar is attractive the
bacteria breaks its cell wall and the
bacteria is destroyed before it has a
chance to be produced silver occurs
naturally in the earth and it's been
used for centuries as a purifying agent
today this technology is used by
healthcare facilities and even NASA for
its antibacterial properties no harsh
chemicals no nanotechnology those were
our guidelines
we've partnered with an american-based
antimicrobial technology company that
uses natural silver to prevent bacterial
growth on textiles their proprietary
process completely covers advanced
fibers with silver while allowing them
to remain extremely soft flexible and
comfortable similar products use harsh
chemical treatments and their
antibacterial effects weaken over time
but because the silver is what would
right into our fabric it will not wash
out a grade in strength even after 200
washes a pillowcase will be just as
effective as day one but a pillowcase
isn't much good if it's not come through
that's why we combine our technology
with long staple supima cotton one
hundred percent of this cotton is grown
in the US and is among the softest most
durable cotton in the room with holistic
skin care and overall well-being in mind
we've created a pillowcase that's part
of the solution not the problem we
wanted to bring textile innovation to
the bedroom and believe that Silvan is a
product that everyone can benefit from
the average pillowcase is swarming with
bacteria and Silvan keeps bacteria in
check no more sleeping on a dirty pillow
case where a team of engineers and
designers we believe the fabric you rest
on should be more than just an
afterthought we know from experience
what goes into manufacturing this
product we just need your support to
make it happen
you
there are moments in life that you never
want to forget when you take a picture
you know the place the people around you
the landscape and the details a couple
of days later and you will forget most
of it a couple of years later and you
probably can't even remember where the
photo was taken your memory is gone
wouldn't it be great to have a camera
that captures everything you experience
with your friends and family and that
lets you and your friends react
sperience those moments later when you
spend time with your mates and loved
ones wouldn't it be great to be able to
relive the atmosphere of that day when
someone you love creates something great
wouldn't it be nice to discover things
that you hadn't even noticed when you
took a photo hi I'm yonas creator of the
panono camera a camera that can do
exactly these things it captures
everything in every direction all at
once and it has a super high resolution
of 72 megapixels it uses 36 tiny but
powerful cameras that fire all at once
you just throw them to the error and at
the highest point when it is barely
moving captures a fully spherical
panoramic image automatically to view
the images you simply point the
smartphone or tablet in the direction on
the sea and move it around
it's amazing absolutely
we built the original prototype 2 years
ago back then it was called throwable
panoramic ball camera you put a video of
it on YouTube which was viewed nearly
three-and-a-half million times we got a
lot of great press coverage but most
importantly we got thousands of emails
from people wanting to buy the camera at
that time and in that form it was too
expensive for mass production so we sat
down to develop a new camera that a
small affordable and possible
I booked out of the new design we call
it the panono camera the camera is tough
so you can throw it in the air and even
drop it on occasion there are several
easy ways to use it firstly of course by
throwing it but you can also put it on a
stick and hold it in the air or simply
hold it in your hand and press a button
to make a picture all the panoramic
images in this video was shot with our
prototype the new design will have the
same functionality but is much smaller
and tougher I was very much impressed by
the 360-degree concept you catch the
moment with all the things around you
now everybody can discover the whole
situation I support the team to ensure a
seamless process from the original idea
to the finished serious product we have
a working prototype and a great new
design and with your help we can finish
the development and manufacture of the
camera by September support us and be
one of the first 20 Napa no no camera

if you think this is a lantern think
again we've designed a brighter diffuser
and a more compact versatile light that

feet and it's IP x6 water-resistant
Landers started out as a simple idea a
paper cone cutout and founder Corey's
home workshop he was amazed at the
result and it was quickly off to the 3d
printer then finally into the beautiful
handmade prototype so how could you use
lantern for backpacking and camping

as urban cyclist we wanted to deal with
the biggest problems of biking in cities
namely navigation and security there are
a couple of accessories that try to
solve these issues but there hasn't been
any complete solution introducing smart
Taylor smart a low isn't just another
bike accessory in fact it's not meant to
be removed after each tribe it installs
permanently on handlebar and pairs with
your smartphone in turn nearby into a
smart match and provide a biking
experience like no other smart halos
design philosophy has always been
centered on simplicity biking in cities
can be a challenge so we've made sure
our device was simple yet smart how by
reducing its interface which simplest
possible form a circle this luminous
halo allows us to communicate an
impressive amount of information
smart halo finds the quickest safest
routes and bike paths for you to make
your ride a stress-free experience just
input the destination in our app suck
your phone safety in your pocket and
let's my tailor will take care of the
rest our unique circular interface

second option also our light patterns
warn you in advance of an engine in turn
so you get plenty of time to plan your
next as soon as you start writing smart
halo tracks your bike metrics your time
distance average speed the calories

elevation unlike regular fitness apps
you don't need to press start or stop it
does it all seamlessly you don't even
need to take your phone out of your
heart smart halo is also equipped with a
smart nightlight it turns on
automatically when it's dark and shuts
off on its own when you're done right
with the personal assistant teacher
smart halo will notify you of incoming
calls or text messages right on your
handlebar all of this intelligence
wouldn't be possible without having
smart he'll living permanently on
Hanover the design goal of smart health
was to build a simple and integrated
interface that would fit any bicycle and
under any condition it's built to resist
the worst that Mother Nature can throw
it be a train dirt or snow smart halo
was also built to resist your bikes
worst enemy fight these assembled with a
unique temper proof system smart halo
can only be unlocked with a special key
provided with the product but we went
further than this
smart hello is also an integrated alarm
system when activated anyone trying to
steal your sweet ride will hear the
angry roar of smart fellow smart hello
has been designed to be beautiful inside
and out there is no unlock button on
smart hello its sophisticated sensors
detect your presence it only turns on
when you are writing when you're done it
shuts down by itself all this leads to
amazing battery life to keep going as
long as you do under normal usage smart
Taylor will last around three weeks it's
become obvious within three no
transportation methods if bikes are to
be legitimized we need to be connected
in smart and elegant with smart halo
