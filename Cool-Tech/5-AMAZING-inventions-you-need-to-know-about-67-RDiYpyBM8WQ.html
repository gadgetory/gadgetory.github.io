technology is that it truly touches the
lives of every person on the planet and
we're not just about PCs and servers
anymore today we're involved with
everything from drones and virtual
reality headsets to sensors that keep
smart factories running in that toyomi
parking spaces are available because
what Intel really does best is to
continually redefine computing five
years ago we created the Intel nook a
system that brings the full performance
of a standard desktop tower in just four
inches square and now we're going even
smaller even more revolutionary with the
Intel compute card this tiny device
about the size of a credit card is a
complete computer and because it's based
upon a standardized interface it makes
it easy to integrate compute into
everything with compute now packaged in
a tiny module it can simply be added
into any device that would benefit from
connectivity or intelligence and this
new reality brings about tremendous
benefits for developers and customers
alike for developers it's easier to add
new technologies into their design
simplifying their processes and
accelerating their time to market and
since a customer can just slide this
into their device it allows for easy
customizations and quick maintenance and
upgrades we've also developed a compute
car docking system which can be
integrated into other products or used
to make the compute card into a
standalone mini PC you are going to be
seeing a ton of great new devices built
around this innovative technology that
will deliver amazing experiences that
will make your life fuller more informed
and richer and after all isn't that what
technology is supposed to do

hey I'm Eric and I'm stoked to share
with you the Riptide r1 an electric
skateboard that blends massive power and
a compact design let's check it out
the riptides has dual belt-driven motors
at 1,800 watts of power you can fly up
the line and get it to the top speed of
20 miles per hour in no time with all
that power riding up hills is no problem
the board is rated for 8 miles of range
and it actually gets it once you get
your destination just grab it and go
more than anything I designed the
riptides out of my love for surfing
skating and snowboarding this board has
built by riders for riders which drove
some very key decisions first it had to
have a kick tail so I can tack it around
or kick it up then it had to be built to
shred so it can handle anything I throw
at it
to ensure a smoother ride it has wide
trucks and some of the best long
boarding wheels on the market finally I
knew I'd want to bring it on all my
adventures so our battery pack is UN
approved and airline friendly I've
ridden almost every electric skateboard
on the market and I found the perfect
board for me doesn't exist so I designed
the riptides focusing on big-time power
and a small pad
at Riptide Electric we build a board
that blends massive power and a small
package if you can handle it you're
gonna love the way it rides
