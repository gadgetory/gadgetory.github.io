gun you must always be prepared happy
train you are your gun safe when it's
not on you you want to know it's secure
and accessible safes are not always
accessible or easy to open especially in
the dark and locks are a nuisance to
operate as for smart guns while smart
guns are a dangerous concept taking an
unreliable technology and embedding it
into your gun is not a smart decision
our mission is to bring you the perfect
solution introducing sorex the new
generation of gun store
sorex is calibre specific and has two
modes the first mode is awareness if
someone tries to tamper with your gun
you're immediately alerted and when you
need your gun charging it will eject
zorax and chamber a fresh round the
second mode is when your gun is locked
when's or is locked no one can charge
your gun if someone tries to charge your
gun the locking mechanism will
immediately expand preventing the gun
from being loaded special polymers in
the locking mechanism prevent any damage
to the barrel surahs developed a
revolutionary unlocking mechanism rapid
dial rapid dial is a simple mechanism
which counts clicks while you turn it
you don't need to start from a specific
point even the direction that you turn
the lock doesn't matter these two
factors allow you to unlock your weapon
without looking at it even in the dark
you can choose a simple code or any
length code you wish
you won't believe how fast and simple it
is until you try it you can also open
zorax from your phone but you can only
lock it by physically pressing the lock
button zorax normally communicates with
your phone directly through bluetooth it
also comes with as or bridge a bluetooth
to Wi-Fi router when plugged into the
wall near your gun you'll be made aware
from anywhere in the world if your gun
is being tampered with now if your home
is your safe and you don't lock your gun
but you still want alerts we have a
solution the zone watchdog the sore
watchdog is not a lock but rather a
notification device its sole purpose is
to notify you if your weapon is tampered
with sorex was invented by veterans of
elite IDF technological in combat units
we worked on it for two years bringing
it to perfection
your ex allows you to be ready aware and
see more than ever before join the zhou
revolution own your gun
everyday objects of our lives are
constantly evolving phones have become
handheld computers cars are smarter and
cleaner watches have turned into
personal assistants but what about our
shoes we spend most of our lives wearing
them but besides fashion designs they
have seen little evolution in the last
few decades we bend over to tie them to
untie them they come undone they get
stuck in our bike chain we leave the
laces tied all the time and damage our
shoes sure we have velcro shoes and
zippers but you still have to bend over
and they don't fit nearly as firmly as
good old laces at power lace we wanted
to figure out a way to create shoes that
fit firmly and comfortably without ever
having to lace or unlace them we decided
to think differently and we found a
solution we are proud to introduce the
p1 our new Auto lacing system allows for
efficient hands-free shoelace time the
first time you wear them slide your foot
in adjust the tension once and you're
set you'll never have to bend over again
to take off the shoes use your other
foot to press down on the back lever
it's that simple it's a nice product
it's a very streamlined it's not bulky a
thin sole lot of companies have big
bulky Souls Kevlar lace on any products
definite advantage been working in the
street for 25 years between two pairs of
pillars is broken power lace shoes will
simplify tasks of everyday life allowing
you to take advantage of a snug shoe fit
while on the go
in my 15 years in the footwear industry
I've never seen such a innovation they
are comfortable they are very stable too
so ya think it's amazing our shoes are
made of the very best materials and
combined proven shoe design with our
innovative technology we have working
prototypes and have met with
manufacturers we are ready to start
production
our very first men's shoe the p1 will
soon be available in many different
colors help us make auto lacing shoes a
reality pre-order your pair today and
become a power laser
hi I'm Tony Gonzalez and I'm excited to
introduce to you today fabulous new
product the wine squirrel decanter the
special decanter allows you to have a
glass or two of your favorite wine and
enjoy the rest of the bottle days or
even weeks later the wine squirrel story
began after a conversation with my
brother we both experienced the
frustration of one ting go open a bottle
of wine and having just a glass but not
wasting the rest of the bottle problem
is the once you open the bottle it gets
exposed to air and continuous exposure
to air causes the wine to oxidize and go
back right there dinner I grabbed a pen
and a napkin and started to draw a
conceptual sketch of a product to solve
this problem now there were some
products that tried to solve the problem
by inserting a device into the wine
bottle itself problem is that was
trapped there and oxidation still
occurred I thought why not tackle this
problem a bit differently and decant the
wine bottle into a special container
that completely avoided any contact with
air this avoids not only having trapped
air but also avoids any kind of
consumables like gas canisters to take
my napkin sketch and turn it into a
product we teamed up with Australian
designer five slurring we are now proud
to present the wine squirrel decanter
this unique product can completely
change the way you drink one I can now
enjoy a glass of wine with dinner and
not worry about the waste so how does
this product work well it consists of
this lead-free crystal decanter and the
seal after you pour the wine into the
decanter you simply insert the seal at
the level of the wine and turn you've
now formed a completely airtight seal
the seal you've just created is so
effective that you can even turn your
decanter upside down no wine will come
out when you're ready to drink the wine
simply disengage the seal then remove
that's it your wine will now be
beautifully preserved for days or even
weeks
we're here in Sonoma County California
with vineyard owner Jennifer crane who's

a bottle of my whoa farms crane vineyard
designated poured it into the wine

technological advancements have brought
us into a world filled with touchscreen
devices everything is tailored to our
changing lifestyles so why aren't our
gloves what if I told you there is one
solution that could turn all your
existing gloves in the touchscreen
gloves
hi my name is Tony and this is nano tips
every solution starts with a problem
mine came from riding my motorcycle I
was fed up with having to take off my
gloves every time I wanted to use my
smartphone I just bought these new
expensive loves and wasn't about to buy
another pair so I decided to look for
more cost-effective ways to turn my
existing gloves the touchscreen
compatible ones my research led me to
some pretty limited options the
available solutions rather ugly damaging
or wouldn't hold up the everyday wear
and tear after months of ideas and
experimenting I finally came up with a
solution that met all my needs nano tips
was born nano tips is an advanced paulo
mind liquid solution formulated using
nanotechnology using nano tips is easy
you just apply it and dry we put enough
liquid into each bottle so that you can
treat multiple gloves it's extremely
durable and can last in any situation
we've also made sure that the liquid
won't damage your gloves best of all it
looks like it's barely there
we have formulated two solutions to meet
your specific needs narrative blue is
designed specifically for fabrics this
formula dries to a transparent blue tint
making it virtually invisible on colored
fabrics our second solution is called
nano tha's black it's designed for
leathers rubbers and other thicker
materials nanotubes block is so
versatile you can turn a pen into a
stylist
here in Vancouver we have spent the last
year engineering this formula putting it
through rigorous tests to ensure that
you get the best results our goal is to
give everyone the freedom to choose the
perfect love with style comfort and
functionality me
this is where I need your help kick
starters you're backing will ensure that
production is scaled so that we can
provide this product for everyone
especially you I'm really excited to
bring down and hips to market and I
can't wait for you to use it I would
