I'm Matt and I'm Audrey and together we
run seed design so independent product
design studio industry what we do best
is make really nice toys and gifts
especially ones that you assemble
yourself lately please become obsessed
with pipes pipes are awesome you think
every single culture around the world
has their own design we've made over 50
versions small sites and big pipes using
everything from paper to ripstop nylon
chime now bamboo and cake to see what
get the best results along the way
after all these iterations were ready to
present the Kakaako carton it's a
rectangular pipe with two long tails in
a single bridle it's as easy as it gets
this is an educational paper and bamboo
light kit that teaches you how to put it
together we wanted to make it as easy to
assemble humanly possible for all
materials are included the kite has peel
and stick adhesive to make construction
completely mess free assembly only takes
five to ten minutes and you put it
together the instructions disappear once
it's ready a beautiful pattern kite is
ready to source

as possible so our girls positively
affects our community and this Pike kit
is no different our kit also comes with
bamboo there's cuts of length
reinforcements to keep your fight going
and handle the strings and an elastic
bowline for extra stability as you are
sewing it around
we realized that it needed a case to
keep its place between foot so we
designed a super-fun cardboard briefcase
that uses the kite string handle as the
handle our goal in the project is to
create a click it at an accessible price
point that's both beautiful and flies
great we're excited to tell you that our
design has been finalized and Arclight
kit is ready for production it will be
available in three colors peach mint and
black-and-white the three different
geometric patterns printed directly on
the front with three years old and
completely self-funded and we need your
help to produce this pumpkin of scale

able to get the diet can buy the
materials in order to manufacture the

treated with chlorine and it's
continually getting harder to hydrate
ourselves during the day the tap water
we drink be completely of the fact
considering more than half of our body

supplement like energy middle and a
day-to-day function
oh did you seem to refill an activated
charcoal filter that removes chlorine
and other organic contaminants from tap
water seems you need to spit on the 65%
of the plastic bottles you'd find in a
city market over the last two years
we've been studying the science that's
activated charcoal and the filtering
qualities that has intact what a passage
to the pool and it's proven to remove
selected missiles and chemical
contaminants so we wanted to utilize the
science and design a product that would
benefit everyone each poster contains an
aggravated child sick made from coconut
shells egg a filter a seven hundred mil
bottle 150 times or for 105 liters
activated charcoal is made of a small
low volume Paul in 1 gram of a surface
area of 500 meters quid which he the
synthesizer metropolis feels the force
contained negatively charged ions which
attract the positively charged elements
from technology at the grid covers and
pouring it effectively removes is
contaminant but retains the next mineral
resulting in a fresh and thorough
filtration we visited the five main
supermarket here in New Zealand then
we've found with its coarse filter on to
65% of the bottle David Barker show what
the McCoy image that the because of
thousands of different motor and water
business bottles that a refillable
adapter this means that encourages
people to keep reusing the pre-lab
plastic bottles at 70% of the world
body going Lancefield and we believe
with another step in the reduction of
favorite bottle consumption worldwide
the encasement has a hexagonal can
misspelled design achieving a streamline
and steady flow it is made from
recyclable plastic the 28 millimeters
that the cap means it can screw into a
huge range of beverage bottles all
around the world anything which means it
makes it the ultimate travel accessory
and anywhere you go you can have access
to filters and tasteless
a product 150 refills of 700 mil bottles
we can save hundreds if not thousands of
dollars on bottled water each year we've
seen a countless amount of time

give it to this point of manufacture no
