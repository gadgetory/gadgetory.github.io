on our tech every day to empower us to
make a difference but our tech relies on
us for one thing
does this look familiar forget that this
is eclipse the new neater way to charge
your devices
with its compact and round design it can
live on your nightstand desk or even
your wall eclipse is more than just a 3
port USB hub it's the only charging
station that you won't want to hide away
setup is easy up to three of your USB
cables are one into their own
precision-engineered channel so you
don't have to worry about them tangling
or overlapping
unlike cable boxes and charging stations
that just hide the mess
Eclipse keeps up to 24 feet of cables
neat and easy to access it comes with a
braided power cable essentially
extending each of your charging cables
by an extra 4 feet now you only need one
power socket to charge all of your
devices better yet you can use the
cables you already have
it doesn't just look good though unlike
lots of under powered USB hubs out there
Eclipse intelligently ensures that your
devices are charging at their maximum
speed it uses an advanced transformer to
deliver safe and stable currents that
won't damage your precious devices
batteries and for your early adopters it
even has a USBC port now for the magic
with a single touch Eclipse Rises and
emits a subtle halo forget having to
turn on the lights to find that dreaded
cable tap it once more and it's halo
fades away along with your cable
frustration all the three years ago we
launched our first we start the campaign
the jump cable we deliver over 10,000
units got priceless feedback from our
backers helping us bring an exciting new
product market since then we've been
designing and producing a full line of
charging cables none of this would have
been possible without the Kickstarter
community however no matter how much
effort we put into making the best
possible charging cables there was
always one issue that wasn't addressed
we ran a survey and quickly learn from
thousands of people that this was a pain
sure by almost everyone so we got to
work we've been living in breathing
Eclipse for over a year now selecting
the best materials and working closely
with industry leaders refine every
single detail after multiple design
iteration and prototypes we finally have
the solution we've been looking for now
we're back on Kickstarter the community
that helped us change the way people
think about charging with the clips
we're not launching just another USB hub
we're trying to enhance the way people
live with their tech only you can tell
us if this is worth making are you sick
of cable clutter so are we let's make it
a thing in the past
good morning everyone Michael did you
see the game last night it's okay we've
all been there before starting our days
tired and cranky where we can't live
without coffee or energy drinks
struggling to get one night's good sleep
but I was lucky enough to find a
solution to these problems and I'm
excited to share it with you today it's
rest on a smart device that helps you
achieve your best sleep hey Leo wake up
that's not how you use it oh these are
not these no no one of the many awesome
things about rest on is that it's not
wearable it would be ironic if a sleep
monitor makes it harder for you to fall
asleep right rest on is designed to
guarantee you the most comfortable
natural and free sleep the magnetic lid
does not only help to fix the device
easily on your sheet but also turns on
the device automatically when it's
locked
it is wireless and paper-thin you won't
feel its presence at all in your sleeve
while information such as your heart
rate respiratory rate and body movements
are accurately collected and analyzed it
is closer to your heart when you rest on
it the sensors are placed right under
your test where all of your vitals are
this is one of the reasons why
restaurants accuracy and benchmark
medical devices and surpass any
wristband be an accurate and non
wearable at the same time requires the
most cutting-edge technology and design
in the industry rest on is equipped with
medical grade paper-thin sensors which
can capture all the data needed for
monitoring and managing your sleep you
can easily review all your sleeping
information on your smartphone using the
rest on app along with personalized
advice it's like having a private sleep
consultant right at your fingertips you
will know exactly what you need to do to
improve your sleep with rest on
restaurants innovative family cloud
allows you to share your sleep data with
loved ones no matter where you are east
coast to west coast North America to
Asia
well everyone shall we get back to work
we need to make sure that the first
batch of rest on gets out in time for
the holiday season over here like I'm I
needed Michael if guides it would be my
gift to everyone this year hi I'm David
Horne CEO and co-founder of sleep pays
please support us on IndieGoGo now and
make read on the best gift ever a gift
to us so we could continue to improve
user experience and a give to your loved
ones in yourself not just a gadget but
better sleep thank you so much
