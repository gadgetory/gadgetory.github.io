capabilities of the human body can be
enhanced so mobility is always enabled
and never left impaired that spark of
imagination lit the fuse that triggered
the launch three and a half years later
of the world's first Bionic knee brace
introducing levitation levitation stores
energy when you bend your knees and
releases it as you straighten them
enabling you to play longer work harder
and do more for nearly 80 years other
braces of attempted this but they use
traditional Springs and were too heavy
too big or just not powerful enough
levitations unique Bionic design changes
the game it's remarkably powerful it's
comfortable because it's lightweight and
compact and it's affordable
we designed a brace with ease of use in
mind limitation only weighs two pounds
and it has quick release trapping to go
on and come off fast
our final spring technology was inspired
by the hydraulic systems and high
performance aircraft our shells are
carbon fiber the same ultralight
material used in Formula One race cars
along the way we made over fifty
different prototypes each time getting
feedback and making small adjustments
and we tailor the Bionic response of
your brace to your specific need whether
that's unleashing the star athlete
inside you or simply keeping up with
your grandkids so here's where we need
your help
spring loaded is set to produce
levitation right here in our
manufacturing facility we want to spread
the word about levitation and how it's
different than every brace that's come
before it this is game changing even
life-changing technology you can order
levitation right now and help us bring
this amazing product to the world you
can donate and for every eight hundred
dollars raised we'll give a brace to a
person in need or by simply sharing this
project you'll be helping us change the
way the world moves
you
my name is Anthony Ortiz and I'm the
founder and CEO of fitly and we're based
here at a Philadelphia PA in 2001 we had
to watch our dad suffer through triple
bypass surgery and that was one of the
scariest moments in my family's time
what really bothered us the most as a
family is to later discover that his
entire condition could have been
completely avoidable had he just
followed a strict dietary guideline and
been a little more active he could have
prevented that condition and so I
decided to do something about it we've
created a product called smart plate
that can help you instantly track
everything you eat and do it in a way
that is effortless smart plate comes
with three digital cameras and uses
advanced image recognition to identify
everything sitting on its surface it
also comes with load sensors that
capture the exact weight of all your
food and then sends the image and weight
information to the cloud for analysis
currently our algorithms can read and
identify food up to 99% accuracy the
smart plate is customizable and
personalized to you so someone who's an
athlete someone who's a generalist in
terms of Health someone who needs to
manage their health condition someone
who needs to lose weight or maintain
their weight there's no one person that
this is for this is good for anyone who
wants to maintain a certain diet and
meet a certain dietary goal the smart
plate can also tell you how fast you're
eating based on the load that's removed
off the plate it'll even tell you when
you've gone over on your macronutrients
it takes your behavior and then makes
subtle recommendations or nudges and
you'll have the access to deep insight
about this behavior we're confident that
we're going to be able to disrupt the
current status quo and transition from
digital entry to instant automatic entry
and ambient data collection so that it's
just happening in a seamless way
there's a gap between your phone
applications and yourself because you're
still held accountable you're still
having to say okay this is what the
portion size should be or you know I
think this is what I'm meeting but I'm
not really sure
with the smart plate there's no gap
you're more accountable and that's why I
like it so I think any type of client
that I have would you smart plate
because they're able to take out the
question of whether or not this is too
much to eat or should I be eating this
the smart plate will just think of it
for them all they have to do is put the
food on the plate
we also think there's tremendous
implications for research this is a data
set that is absent in the market so
we've got wearables we've got all of
these devices and all of this sensory
data out there but what we're eating
no one's capturing this information
collectively what it can do in terms of
educating helping us learn more about
each other as an ecosystem and how we
eat and I think that's super important
at the moment people who want to study
eating habits have to use exactly the
same mechanisms that consumers do when
they're interested in what they're
eating so they have to rely on their
study subjects you're like keeping
Diaries or remembering when and what
they ate and so this is going to really
enable researchers to study and to
understand not just what people are
taking in but how the timing of what
they're taking in relates to other
aspects of their activity so for example
what is the interaction between what you
eat when you eat and how well you sleep
that's something that this tool will be
able to uncover in a way that Diaries
really struggle with we need your help
to get the Alpha prototype ready for
production
we're confident that we can bring this
product to market and deliver it to you
by 2016 we know we can change the world
by creating products that can drive
impact smart plate is one of these
products this is going to help people
lose weight improve their performance
manage those conditions that are related
to that poor nutrition or poor eating
behavior and we're confident that the
world needs us today

introducing the Everlast notebook from
rocket book the Everlast brings cloud
scalability to pen and paper simply
write scan and erase an endlessly
reusable notebook designed for the
digital age here's how it works
Everlast pages look and feel like paper
but they're actually constructed from a
polyester composite rather than would
you write on the Everlast
using any pen from the pilot FriXion
line which are available in-store and
online writing on the Everlast feels
perfectly natural and smooth and as the
ink dries it forms a complete bond to
the polyester page so it won't rub off
but what makes this formulation so
unique is that each page can be wiped
completely clean with a moist towel so
it can be used over and over and over
again the ever last notebook is also
compatible with the Rocket book app so
before you wipe your notes off the page
you can blast them online to your
favorite cloud services in a fraction of
a second rocket book machine vision
scans enhances and sends each page to
the specific destination they belong on
the cloud services you already use each
Everlast notebook page has seven symbols
set up the rocket book app to assign
each symbol to a location within Dropbox
Google Docs Evernote or many other
surfaces you could configure your
diamond to send meeting notes directly
to your shared team Dropbox or students
could configure their star symbol to
send math notes right to a Google Drive
so you can make your list break out that
diagram or color in that drawing then
tomorrow start your day with a brand new
notebook would the ever last one
notebook becomes one thousand notebooks
we're Rocket book and we make notebooks
from the future
