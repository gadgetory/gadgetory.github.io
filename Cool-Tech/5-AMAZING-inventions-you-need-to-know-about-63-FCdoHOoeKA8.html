1984 since then the scanning technology
updates very slowly in a highly
developed smart office today people
still have to use the traditional
scanner which is not user-friendly or
efficient enough we want to make a
change this is the Caesar scanner a
redefined smart office equipment it is
fast able to store data in the cloud
then it can easily scan books to improve
the scanning speed to less than 1.5
seconds per page
Caesar innovatively uses the CMOS
scanning technology and equipped to a
32-bit m IPS CPU to transfer the
information easily and omit the
complicated procedures of installing
driver Caesar cloud enables automatic
cloud processing and storage to achieve
the goal of scanning bounded books
teaser is equipped with the advanced
smart algorithms which can flatten
curved remove fingerprints purify
background and split pages automatically
in addition with Sony HD camera Caesar
can guarantee the high quality of
scanning with embedded OCR function
Caesar can make image editable with one
click with the innovative visual
presenter function Caesar can output
1080 video at 30 frames per second
Caesar is a smart scanner based on cloud
computing and IOT technology no matter
where you are in office or at home no
matter what they are financial invoices
business contract or private collection
books Caesar can always help you scan
easily and efficiently
imagine a day I'm in Clark and
get all the palm of your hand
fiction going to incredible sights of
the waves test looked out of water
this is Mike Boudreau when we began on
micro drone our aim was to create a
small sized personal drone but with a
portable durable easy to fly that works
straight out of the box a drone for
everyone whether you fly micro drone in
extreme conditions like on a windy beach
or in delicate ones like inside your
home with its precision control
flexibility and durability you can fly
it anywhere no matter your age or flying
experience there's no other drone like
we're doing really innovative stuff we
don't cut corners we're in it for the
long run we launched the first edition
micro drones in 2011 and the feedback
was incredible we redesigned the second
edition around the modular architecture
it support a unique range of plugs and
plain modules it received rave reviews
and accessible journals online blog and
even TV shows little drones that are
like I think they're awesome man have
you seen the micro drones before yeah
that's probably my favorite one it's
incredibly nimble perfect if you're
filming extreme force it is very rugged
and if anything did break its modular
design means it's easy to replace any
part now after two years we're ready to
make micro drone 3.0 micro drone 3.0 is
designed with drone enthusiasts and
excellent engineers from around the
world
components are easily expandable
upgradable and replaceable it's also the
smallest drone to currently carry a
mechanical gimmick the HD camera streams
live footage to your smartphone the
batteries slide in and out for quick hot
swapping and the park and play smart
module simply snap on with magnets since
everything either snaps or slides in the
structure is sleek aerodynamic and
beautiful so now it's possible using a
3d printer technology like the Ultimaker
- you can print out your own custom
frame similar to the dragon or the one I
was super excited when the when the
micro drone team reached out and wanted
to make a first person view drone
technology using the DODOcase VR viewers
very key people could use first-person
view drone technology even a year ago
the fact that the micro ground team is
making this technology available is
really a revolutionary idea we want to
make the quintessential drove the drone
market is evolving and together we can
drive the technology forward we need
your before but no matter who you are
we're making sure that whoever up from
the bottom finding simple reliable
portable durable and fundraise
thank you and we look forward to making
with you the next one and only micro
drone
the green but not cold
this is a tennis this is a rider walk a
tent is a good solution to sleep in
nature Rhino will visit all around
incredible solutions that's just
incredible yeah we repeated the word
incredible can attend to this no it
can't
oh and when you lay down to sleep in a
tent you need a sleeping bag and a
mattress you know what Ryan Wolfe has to
say about that
ha ha ha stupid tent and blind the wolf
is a modular attachable uh what do I
call it not a tent because it's so much
better than a tent it's a modular
attachable rider wall because there's
nothing like it
lino wolf is amazing we built everything
is precisely the private is the
strongest possible with extra thought
the weight with all those right
materials and a built-in sleeping bag
and mattress rhino wolf weighs only 5
pounds that's at least two pounds less
than carrying a sleeping bag mattress
and tent separately and you also don't
look like a snail when carrying it ah
look at that snail man mailman Rhino
wolf also weighs less than other all in
110 but it's also better than them
because it's not a tent
it's a rhino bull rhino wolf has a main
arch that gives the entire structure its
solid strength and allows for straight
dive which enables great airflow and a
fit for the human body you're human
right yeah you are
and blind walls can withstand very low
temperatures and feels very cool in warm
one
of course it's wind proof rain proof and
bugs
it's a rhino it's strong and yet it also
comes in pink and rhino wolf can pull
out any colour the setup Ryan will you
just use one pole yeah one that's less
than any other number just push the pull
through this leave and you're done now
thanks to the Rhino of course you can
easily attach your incredible Rhino wall
to other credible right walls and clean
up the back of Rhino walls get it a
rhino wolf pack take a look at the Rhino
wolf believe me that it weighs less but
keeps you warmer we dip some feeling
from the bottom added it to the top and
put an insulating air mattress instead
so you sleep like in a bed not like
you're stuck in a cube like some two
feeds or something you're not toothpaste
you're a human and you deserve comfort
riding wolf comfort when you attach
another Rhino wolf you can also attach
the blankets to create a double bed for
you know things you do in a double bed
need some privacy just close your own
Rhino wall and you've got your own room
yup a double bed with privacy is that
better than your home probably not
that's a stupid comparison be we have a
vision no more tents no more carrying
extra sleeping equipment just ride
wolves everywhere because a tent that's
ok
Rhino wolf is incredible get one and be
happy it's simple
Rhino what does a rhino wolf do
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
