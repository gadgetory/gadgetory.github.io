proud to announce the Wayland's camp
first data-driven camera built from the
ground up for drivers our system
includes a high-performance camera on
Bluetooth enabled obd2 connector and a
stylish steering wheel remote all of
which comes haired from out of the box
so it's as simple as plugging in and
play we've gone beyond the ordinary box
eNOS of regular camera and design a
device that fits into the interior of
any high-end vehicle by combining video
and data our camera enables users to
tell the full story of their behind the
wheel experiences the Bluetooth enabled
obd2 connector taps directly into the
car's computer allowing users to show
what's going on under the hood as well
as on the road in addition to
performance data from the vehicle the
Whelan's camera is loaded with its
advanced sensor suite including a 10
hertz gps sensor for professional level
track timing a 9 access motion sensor
for recording all the genes atacar poles
and dual microphones for capturing the
symphony of exhaustion gone are the days
of having to sift through hours of
footage the camera software can identify
the most interesting clips using data
for example it can identify the highest
tree forces or it can identify clips
with the fastest 0 to 60 poles by the
time you pull over the Wayland's mobile
app presents you with interesting clips
that are ready to share through a simple
interface with the included steering
wheel remote you can even share your
driving experience from behind the wheel
without ever touching your phone we've
assembled an incredible team of
world-class designers developers and
engineers
we're not just launching a product we're
building a community we want our first
users to appreciate all of the hard work
that's gone into designing and
engineering this camp that's why we're
launching on Kickstarter to provide our
early adopters with pre-orders at a
fraction of the retail price come help
us build the Wayland's community

you
sell me this pencil a rebar cane we have
successfully identified and solved a
number of issues with existing pencils
it's a pleasure to introduce to you
magna as design engineers is in our
nature to challenge and innervates
products we use every day other products
use a full release or incremental action
which dictates the lead position our
patent-pending magnetic propulsion
technology offers finite controllability
unlike other pencils the secret to our
revolutionary invention is concealed
within the court of the pencil the outer
sleeve synchronizes its position to the
inner magnet shielded within the premium
grade aluminium body it works like magic
every detail has been considered whilst
it may not be visible to the naked eye
the ends of the pencil are slightly
larger in diameter to prevent the sleeve
from falling off we have sourced our
manufacturers pay for tooling and have
received our final prototypes
so now we need your help to raise the
funds and hit a minimum order quantities
it really is the last piece of the
puzzle we want to make our dream a
reality and start shipping these
fantastic new products to your door we
strongly believe that making profit
should come second to great design
therefore we price these pencils an
extremely affordable rate to make them
accessible to the wider Kickstarter
community a product with this level of
consideration really is a tool for life
and perfect as a gift to your family and
friends so now it's up to you to help us
bring the pencil into the 21st century
thank you for watching
you
