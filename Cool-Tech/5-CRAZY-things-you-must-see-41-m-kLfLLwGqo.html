but while the goal is to lose our
inhibitions most of us end up losing our
stuff instead the more technology
evolves the more gadgets we buy and the
dream of travel can be replaced by a
nightmare we had enough of those
panic-stricken moments and what if we
could prevent disaster before it happens
this is the reality of the Mutai
a smart rechargeable tag that notifies
you immediately if you forget something
got an upcoming calendar notification
like a flight where you'll need to
remember a long list of stuff you'll be
reminded just in time ensuring you never
miss a beat just open the app name the
item and stick it on focus on your trip
while your new tech takes care of the
rest
this smart learning tech gets to know
you and your habits when you use your
stuff notifying you accordingly
depending on your location you can
adjust the range
no matter what phase of your journey
you're at the mute AG has your back
every step of the way the only thing you
need to worry about is whether you're
brave enough to tackle that bungee jump
rollercoaster whoo wherever Adventures
calling you to with the new tag you can
check in your tag items in just a few
clicks and travel should be simple not
more stressful than a day at the office
once you've touched down and need to
collect your luggage
you'll never have to fight your way
through a mob of passengers ever again
just chill out and when it arrives on
the belt and you'll know through an
instant notification when it's ready for
collection no more searching and no more
stress
heading home can't find your car the tag
will navigate you to your vehicle
hassle-free the past year has been a
roller coaster of our own developing and
perfecting the new tags potential our
team has made it possible and we
couldn't be more excited to have
partnered with the top manufacturing
names in the business we're ready to
bring the new tech to you but we need
your help to cover our growing
manufacturing costs in overhead we need
funding to turn our dream into your
reality we're dreamers creating world of
stress free travelers and hassle free
James oh the places you'll go
let's fun tomorrow today together will
you
at night when you're getting ready for
bed
all you do is put it on and hit start
sleep on the app it instantly begins
monitoring your brain rate and begins to
play the right binaural beats as the
sleep Shepherd senses your brain rate
lowering it changes the tones it's smart
too because it knows when you fall
asleep and when you do it turns off the
tones but it continues to monitor your
brain if the sleep Shepherd senses your
brain is waking up the tones will turn
back on and guide you back to a deeper
sleep because a sleep Shepherd keeps you
in deeper sleep for longer you can get
the same amount of sleep you usually do
but now those hours are gonna count more
because of its organic shape because
it's lightweight because the fabric
breathes so well to sleep Shepherd is
incredibly easy to sleep in on your back
on your side it doesn't matter you're
gonna forget you have it on the sleep
Shepherd is not some 3d render that
might get made once we get funded both
the fully functioning sleep Shepherd and
app for iPhone and Android are ready
right now there are a lot of features
with the sleep shepherd we're really
excited about it tracks every aspect of
your sleep how long you're asleep what
kind of sleep you're in even your head
orientation during the night and it
holds onto this data so you can see how
it improves your sleep over time in the
morning the sleep Shepherd uses the same
concept it used to put you to sleep but
in Reverse to wake you up over time it
gently waits your brain up
everyone's had that morning when you
wake up and feel refreshed but it's more
than that
you wake up you're ready you're alert
you're excited you wake up and you feel
incredible that's what it's like when
you wake up with the sleep Sheppard my
daughter's been using the sleep Sheppard
every night and as of December 2013
she's off the GHB completely
she's sleeping better and her life has
changed for the better for the first
time we have a real solution for sleep
and we think that's something to get
excited about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
