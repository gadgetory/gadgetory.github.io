you from the team of Marco mobile
electronics are everywhere today and the
last three years alone over four billion
smartphones have been sold globally they
help us stay connected no matter where
we are and have completely changed the

one big problem battery level hi I'm
Jared with energy solar we've been
making portable solar products for
several years now and have launched
other products on IndieGoGo before to
going through those campaigns allowed us
to talk with thousands of people
interested in solar products and we
noticed the trend we kept having
customers ask for something ultra
lightweight and portable to charge their
phones and other portable electronics
after looking what was currently
available we found dozens of products
that had a few great features here and
there but none of them completely
addressed all of our customers needs we
knew what we had to do
the raptor is the world's first solar
powered USB quick charger it
incorporates all the most advanced
charging technology available and a
durable waterproof and lightweight
design the Raptor generates power using
the most advanced solar panels
technology available today that don't
require perfectly sunny skies that power
is then stored in an ultra-lightweight
lithium-ion battery for use anytime just
lay it out in the Sun and it recharges
itself when full it can easily charge
two to three smartphones to smart USB
ports on the side of the Raptor will
charge your device at the fastest
possible rate up to 75 percent faster
than a conventional wall charger in just
10 minutes you can boost your battery
level like twenty percent whether it's
the trip to your kids baseball game or a
two-week expedition with a while let us
power your passion with your help we can
make the Raptor a reality so you can
focus on what's important and not your
batteries others
we've created prototypes and I've
already begun production for the Raptor
and the Raptor Pro your pre-orders will
help us pay for tooling and materials to
make this possible together we can bring
the world unlimited mobile power on
behalf of Energy Solar thank you for
your support
