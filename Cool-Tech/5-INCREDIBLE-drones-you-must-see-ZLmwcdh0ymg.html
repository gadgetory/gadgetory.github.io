plexi drone we have thought about the
things that people don't really think
about how do you improve drone
technology how do you make it accessible
to everyone how do you inspire people to
create using drone technology a drinkie
robotics we believe technology should be
building bridges towards new levels of
creativity and productivity rather than
barriers and the plexi drill is one of
those technologies a drone that you can
snap together and take apart in less
than one minute and when you're done you
just put it into your hardshell backpack
and take it anywhere that you want to go
the plexi pack is something we designed
in order to carry everything you need to
capture all the great shots that you
want and carry it with you everywhere
you go anywhere you can go with a
backpack you can take the plexi grown
with the plexi drone you can carry more
than just a camera with very simple
payload clips are able to just snap on
whatever it is that you want to put on
there it's so simple another unique
feature about the plexi drone is that it
has a retractable landing gear you will
no longer have any kind of junk in your
shot you never have to crop anything out
at the bottom it's just gonna be clear
beautiful 360 view on the plexi drone
GPS follow me is an amazing feature all
that you do is press follow me on your
mobile device on your phone or your
tablet and it's as easy as that it's
going to be very very easy to use
everybody has a smartphone now great now
you just saved yourself 800 bucks for
controller aside from that you're also
able to control more than one of them at
the same time you will definitely find
no drones that you can control using our
swarm technology it's completely new
something you won't find anywhere else
that means that you're able to view the
same scene from multiple vantage points
you get the same shot with one user but
many drones our drone is equipped with
an ultrasonic sensor at the front it'll
flash its lights and give you an audio
message to let you know that
getting in as a pack you don't have to
interpret blinking LED light because it
tells you in its own voice
initialization sequence completed are
you even going to use me plexi drone is
going to unleash new dimensions of
creativity and productivity and take
your camera to places that you never
thought were possible in order for us to
realize our dream we need your support
any support that you can give to us to
bring the plexi drone to market would be
extremely valuable even just sharing our
story with your friends what we're here
to do is to reimagine what drone
technology means to all of us plexi
drone is ready
you
dad hey are you so ready yeah all right
let's do this
he
wow that is so cool I've always believed
it's best to show your child where to
look but never tell them what to see
because children are natural-born
explorers mother nature is their
favorite teacher puddles are seen as
opportunities not obstacles
challenges are to be readily accepted
should I do away and not feared
their greatest adventure is always what
lies ahead to the top you see that
awesome view and now she can see more
than ever before
with a hangs ghost roan two point oh but
on the propeller it's super easy to take
anywhere the controls mimic the movement
of our smartphone
and she thinks that's pretty cool
and the VR goggles gave us both a whole
new perspective to share in the
experience
elevate your view of the world but he
hangs goes drone 2 point 0 the first VR
drone fully controlled by your phone
welcome to the next level
you
what do you think it takes to get
high-quality drone footage like this a
professional drone operator a cameraman
expensive equipment or simply this
introducing the sci-fi level one drone a
drone that lets absolutely anyone
capture footage like never before syfy's
level up technology is the real
breakthrough by using six rotors the
drone can fly without tilting making it
simple and intuitive enough for anyone
to fly plus you get professional stable
footage without an exposed gimbal
because level up gets rid of the usual
multi-rotor wild tilting the interface
can be simplified to fly just swipe
swipe in is a superior interface that
allows you to see what you're capturing
while flying unlike tilting or joystick
only navigation our flying interface can
be downloaded as an app on your
smartphone it's simple accurate and fun
because drone flying is better when it's
shared the level one can post shots and
video real-time to your social network
of choice and with the new geofence
technology you can define the area in
which you want to fly your drone will
stay within your boundaries of choice
allowing everyone from beginners to
experts to practice their piloting
skills with confidence so far sci-fi
works has been building drones for
industrial application but we want to
bring our drone inventions to everyone
Atkins
friendly prices plus we just love robots
so really we put our full technological
expertise into designing a drone for the
consumer that gives professional video
quality and stability but doesn't
require professional knowledge to fight
our drone will come with a 1080p high
quality camera and it will be ready out
of the box for everything from and
videos to action filming to home
inspection so why Kickstarter sci-fi is
made up of a small passionate group of
robot enthusiasts that wants to make
this breakthrough technology available
to everyone and to make the leap from
commercial to consumer drones we need
your support to keep the price low
compared to other available drones
thanks to the sci-fi level ones
capabilities instead of worrying about
the drone itself you can focus on the
experience the sci-fi level one is
simple to fly captures exactly what you
want and shares it in real time this is
the first drone for absolutely everyone
from the drone company side by
you
hello Kickstarter my name is David early
I'm a big Montaigne snowboarder an
action sports movie maker and I'm really
happy to kick start today XO plus the
world's first autonomous drone system
that will follow you and film you so you
can get the most amazing aerial footage
anytime anywhere in my eyes aerial
footage is really the key to give all
the perspective to action sports and in
the last few years I've really been
spending it so much energy in no trying
all these kind of different tools you
know from high motors two helicopters to
drone you know we thought we could
conquer the world with them but it was a
lot more complicated you know we really
needed something light packable that was
working everywhere all the time poke a
lot to other athletes another film
makers trainer we quickly realized that
such system didn't exist and basically
the only solution was to innovate
today we are pretty excited to launch
our new drum technology The Devil's you
me and also our friends to capture our
best rides in a really easy way
get ready we think so plus you're going
to be able to get the most amazing
aerial footage anytime anywhere
I whats up its matt Roble just try two
days XO please super easy to use awesome
project at the future heck the place no
pilot no cameraman and Noah deck to get
to this point we have been working very
hard over the past month with great and
values people engineers designers and
providers to create a product which is
fast enough and adapt it for action
sports we are transforming how people
use drawn in a safe and autonomous way
so you don't have to think on how the
shot is being captured or how to pirate
the dawn just focus on your moves today
our multi-roter will fly around 70
kilometres per hour and it will also
have an endurance of about 15 minutes
and forward flight is what we're looking
for in the application of the x 0 plus
we're not so much concerned about simple
hovering because hovering is boring we
want action sports
I'm really excited for these guys to
pull this off because it's going to
allow us to do more with less and get
next level aerial shots from some of
their most remote adventures where we
can't take a full RC heli crew into
these spots and bring back more of a
story to share because it follows you
and you don't have to press any buttons
it get six shots nice always got my back
aerial filming it's going to be a
game-changer super excited to see what
these guys do new squad rounds gonna be
insane hey Kickstarter drone technology
doesn't mean to stay in the hands of
only professionals we want to make
aerial filming accessible to everyone we
only need fifty thousand dollars to
launch the first batch and we really
hope that you like this as much as we do
and now you're going to back up the
project and help us to make it a huge
success now don't waste time get yours
now and help us to revolutionize
moviemaking as we know it
you
you
you
