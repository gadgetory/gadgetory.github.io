fundamental elements it makes up about
70% of the Earth's surface and a similar
percentage of our bodies each day we
have an intimate interaction with water
for most of us this starts with our
showers our showers are deeply personal
our long time to wake up to think to
rejuvenate to unwind at Nebbia we set
out to see if we could make this
important part of our daily rituals
better in every way we started with a
nice Carlos one of our co-founders ran a
large fitness club company and was
deeply concerned about the high use of
water together with his father Emilio
they search for a solution it turns out
showers are one of the highest wasters
of water and there hasn't been any
meaningful innovation over a century
nearly five years later dozens of
prototypes built we've had 500 people
try it and now we think we've built
something pretty special imagine being
totally embraced by water from the
moment you step into your shower imagine
an experience with water so moving you
never want to step out your skin feels
soft hydrated maybe is about
experiencing water in a way that you
never have before
to innovate on the shower experience we
had to look outside of the current
industry and approach the engineering
problem from a completely new angle the
last half century of nozzle technology
has completely changed what we can do
with droplet sizes and distributions
however this technology has only been
applied to very specialized fields like
rocket engines and medical devices we
use these same tools and technology to
develop nebula what we do is atomized
streams of water into millions of tiny
droplets by doing this we can achieve 10
times the surface area of water compared
to a regular shower while using a
fraction of the volume
I just got out of my first neviah shower
it was a totally unique experience and I
loved it I was getting hit with these
little water droplets I love the feeling
of all the droplets hitting your skin
it's like you're being enveloped by
water and as an Airbnb host there are a
lot of showers going on in my place and
this is important you know this thing is
if not only make the experience better
for my guests but it's a few money I
felt great it was a really fun
comfortable experience the whole thing
just felt awesome I could take that
shower every day we put nebula to the
test on average Americans take about
eight minutes to shower for the normal
shower that's over 20 gallons of water
for the Nebbia it's only six that's
seventy percent less walk we built
Nebuta be easy to install you simply
unscrew your existing shower and screw
on Nebbia with a wrench some plumbers
tape and included adhesive you don't
have to call the plumber or break tile
in addition Nivea slides up and down a
couple of feet pivots at an angle and
includes a portable wand which you can
position wherever you choose Nebbia
provides a totally new and refreshing
shower experience we've partnered with
world-class design firm box clever to
create a design that is both beautiful
and intuitive yet offers a totally new
degree of adjustability on top of that
the water and energy savings just makes
sense we've set out to build a company
that will transform the way we interact
with water over the course of the next
few decades we've assembled a team of
thermal fluids experts to solve some of
the difficult engineering challenges
that have prevented innovation and
showers for a long time and finally
we're ready to bring that into the world
what if you could turn back time and
relive the best memories of your life
like see your daughter's first steps
again watch your son's first baseball
hit again or simply experience the best
family vacation you've ever had again
meet teleport an entirely new way to
capture and relive the best memories of
your life through the power of virtual
reality technology to capture those
special moments simply plug the teleport
camera in your phone and start shooting
instantly it's that easy
teleport camera has two lenses that work
the same way our eyes see the world it
captures everything you see in the 3d
to relive those memories you've captured
simply put the teleport headset on you
feel as though you're actually there and
experience those unforgettable living
memories again
so clearly that the same emotions you
felt in the past are felt again
memory is one of the most beautiful
creations in London it's one of those
thin strings that hold you and the
people you love together through the
good and the bad times save your best
memories treasure and relive them
Jesus Christ only the world's strongest
cable
unlike other phone cable companies we
won't speculate that you can lift weight
from our cable after all why don't you
want to do that
how are we for anger to the real test
come on let me show you what I mean
rom grim this should be library
welcome to angular this device it will
be testing our cable by bending it 90
degrees both ways at a rate of 60 pence
per minute
you see how Lamia last fall
we could be hit brother but hey let's
take it even further
so for the final test let's see what
people can withstand forces beyond as
you can see our cables are harder better
faster
hi I'm Jason McClellan dr.
neuroscientist and co-founder of Morris
I love helping people improve their
lives and I'm super passionate about
weight loss
I've been over we in the past and I know
how difficult it is to lose weight I
also know how difficult it is to keep
that we at loss going Laureus we believe
this is much more than just diet and
exercise the source of your weight loss
problem lies deep within your brain my
co-founder is dr. Paul McGill and a few
years ago he made an amazing discovery
our brains have what's called a set
point that controls how much body fat we
have this varies from person to person
which is why two people can eat the same
and one will gain weight 12-hour one we
found a way to turn the setpoint down
and the implications of this are
profound a few years ago I realized that
there is a connection between
stimulation of the vestibular nerve just
behind your ear and weight loss I was
working in neurosurgery with Jason at
the time and knew of his interest in
electronics as a hobby from the very
beginning I've been using and developing
the mauryas prototypes on myself within
just one year my body fat had almost
halves and now almost one year later I
still haven't regained any fat this
technology has amazing potential and
we're inviting you to join us at the
Moore Diaz community we want you to be
the first group of people who take part
in the next generation of weight loss mo
Dias is really simple to use just place
it on your head attach the sticky pads
behind your ears turn the headset on and
then control it using the app simple
use mo Deus for just 45 minutes per
session and that's it and the results
well the technology was tasted in
overweight volunteers they didn't change
their diet or lifestyle and received up
to three hours of stimulation a week
after four months we found that all of
the volunteers that lost body fat in one
case as much as 60% statistically these
results are very significant also Moody
has caused a fall and appetite and a
shift of the metabolism towards burning
fat we're delighted by these initial
results and actually can't wait to see
how effective Moody's will be when
combined with some lifestyle changes
it's not noise is good I don't even hear
like it really cools your body now oh
that was amazing that's like the worst
spot is on your back usually it's up in
the emergency room three times throw and
eat anything really
oh yeah that does work yeah
that's really good that's like the spot
to soubise 119 for sure hi I'm Rob and I
live in sunny and hot Houston Texas I
lived all over the world and mostly warm
places such as la Okinawa Hawaii Miami
and now Houston I love warm weather but
I don't like feeling uncomfortable
that's why I created blow the leader in
wearable cooling technology by combining
air flow with aromatherapy flow allows
essential oil users to bring the health
of unoffensive of their diffuser on the
go heat when it gets ahold of you
there's little to no relief unless you
do this this or even this is it us or
does it seem that the summers are
getting and staying hotter longer while
our homes cars and offices are set up
with a seat what about Homer on the moon
fortunately there is relief meet blow
the world's first micro cooling device
that uses the natural power of essential
oil to cool you off here's how it works
place your essential oil insert inside
add one drop of peppermint oil turn it
on and choose your speed if you want to
wear it on the front cook your shirt
like this for those of you is short here
who want to wear it on the back clip to
your shirt like this you also have the
option of clipping it on your pants with
the back clip we recommend tucking your
shirt into the front clip to keep the
air between your shirt and skin use it
to cool off during a variety of
activities such as running hiking biking
working out and anything else but we
didn't stop there what also comes out in
summer months
mosquitoes use blow as a personal
mosquito repellent by simply adding
lemongrass loyalty
goodbye chemicals hello relief we've
already secured the best manufacturer
and sourced the best durable materials
and now we just need your help make our
first production run
so please back our campaign today claim
your very own personal blow and
experience the power of global cooling
