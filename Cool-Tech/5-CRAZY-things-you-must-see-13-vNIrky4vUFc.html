you tell yourself you're going to change
your diet stock your cupboards with
fresh fruit and vegetables you follow
all the latest health blog and all those
new swanky kitchen utensils you've got
them but life gets busy and in the way
of treating our bodies how they should
be treated the problem is in a lack of
motivation or desire to be healthy the
problem is a lack of time at susa we
believe leaving healthy should not be
the difficult choice but the easiest
choice we have studied the signs of
heavy interns are you don't need to 100
different things to be healthy you'll
need two are one heavy a keystone heavy
and everything else you start to fall in
place juicing is one of the simplest and
most effective forms of healthy living
yet the problem with home juicing is
that it's way too much work all those
cumbersome parts the weird angles that
seem intentionally designed to outsmart
your sponge so much effort every time
for seems to be so little reward until
now introducing juicer juicing without
the cleaning imagine a machine that
squeezes every single drop of juice from
the fruit to repress using 8 tons of
force a machine that is so beautiful and
so simple to use that it'd be a crime to
put it anywhere other than your kitchen
bench how does it work simply chop your
fruit and vegetables and put them in the
single use for multiple youths
environmentally friendly juicing back
and then into the juicer it go the
machine is so simple to use that all you
need to do is press one button and 90
seconds later you will have the fruit
squash to almost a paper like thinness
and virtually every drop of nutritious
juice in the glass simply recycle or
reuse the youth back it's entirely up to
you juice is uniquely designed juicing
bags means no fruit or vegetable ever
touch the machine which means no
cleaning no pulling the machine apart no
rinsing just juice add juicer we came up
with the ultimate solution simple
elegant and most importantly convenient
enough to make juicing a daily
healthy habit and we think we've gone
beyond just that we believe that
everybody should be able to maintain a
healthy lifestyle with ease leaving time

make this product cheaper to produce
