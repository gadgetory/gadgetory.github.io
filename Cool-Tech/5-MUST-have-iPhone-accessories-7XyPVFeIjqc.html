scary and it is my iphone 7 ready it go

we found that slim phone cases weren't
that protective and protective phone
cases are ugly so we designed a lot of
phone cases carbon fiber ones metal ones
curved ones wooden ones leather ones you
name it we designed it and we tested
them on real iPhones some survived all
my word
and some didn't you're going expensive
but in the end we did it introducing

with serious engineering that hasn't
compromised on looks Walmart bamboo
black marble black leather matte grey
Kevlar carbon fiber this is London's
Waterloo Bridge higher up here than I
thought it was a 35-foot drop here we go
not even a scratch how because we've
engineered an advanced impact material
arrow shop it's inside all our phone
cases this unique polymer contains
thousands of micro air pockets that
absorb the impact a ball bearing the
drop some regular plastic bounces but on
arrow shock the energy is absorbed the
same thing happens in our phone cases
all our cases are seriously protective
so protective we've dropped it from a
crane onto concrete from 45 feet
all our cases have a steel plate built
into the back and they come with a free
magnetic wall mount for backers they fit
both the iphone 6 and 7 so you don't
have to upgrade your case the same
applies for the 6 plus and the seven
plus here you can see our tools making
our cases using our own materials please
