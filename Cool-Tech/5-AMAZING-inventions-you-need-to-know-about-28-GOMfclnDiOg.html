Smith's please
even I hate that sound then just like me
would likely comes out people helped my
turn up the tease what we do mostly is
repairing tease when it's too late the
Germany over 12 million teeth had to be
expected last year we want to change
that I tell all my patients that for
healthy teeth it's mandatory to use
floss or interdental brushes using the
toothbrush only is not enough the
problem is people just hate to do
internet to clean all devices like flaws
or irrigator and interdental brushes are
too inconvenient to use them every day
this is why we invented doing wash with
the intelligent feeler you can easily
find the interdental spaces and slide
from one gap to another by pushing the
wing brush together the brush runs
through the feeler in between your teeth
we are mark lewis and Barack we found
our company last year mark and I have a
business background and Louis's a
dentist he convinced us of this
incredible idea combines the easy
handling of an oral irrigator with the
effectivity of an internet abortion
today the wing brushes the revolution of
intent of cleaning we did a scientific
study on 1,000 internet space and
decided to bring the wing brush on the
market ourselves the results were clear
with the wing brush test process could
reach significantly more interdental
spaces than with a conventional
interdental brush and top the test
persons preferred a wing rush of a
common interdental brushes scientific
research has shown that material
responsible for the most all diseases if
we find a way to eliminate these
bacteria we are able to prevent carriers
and parent titles various cleaning aids
exist to fight this bacteria but how
come that over fifty percent of all
people have periodontitis and ninety-two
percent of all grown-ups had experience
with carriers using floss is cumbersome
it is really hard to reach all
interdental spaces even more important
is that floss does not have effective
cleaning power interdental brushes have
the highest effectivity unfortunately
their usability is
more difficult the wire inside the brush
can hurt your gum and advance in all
directions the wing brush is the
solution
yah fan and fan hamburger is that the
idea so simple Lewis levantarse it is
probably he asked photo to conventions a
group above a harvard study see one film
I'm all though Kasich meant and they are
one and report in living Russian
following bands education within
survived confirmed apology on start we
are ready to start we need your help to
be Swinburne support us to really find
oil care make it more simple the wing
brush is just the beginning

the convenient squeeze tubes we use for
many products at home and at work have
been around forever but as convenient as
they are it's impossible to completely
empty them until now we all have
accepted the struggle to get everything
out of these tubes amazingly they can
take up to twenty percent of their
precious contents to the landfill
look around your house how many tubes
can you find you'll be surprised let's
end this nonsense once and for all and
start saving you money squeeze tubes get
ready to feel the big squeeze hello I'm
Steve and I'm Clark we're mechanical
engineers from Denver Colorado we're
pros of designing new products the idea
of wasting anything really bugs me we
squeeze tubes no matter how hard i try i
know i'm not getting everything i paid
for there are a lot of products out
there that come in tubes and many of
them are really expensive so a few years
ago we set out to design a product that
could completely empty any two including
medications cosmetics and moisturizers
sunscreens art supplies food items of
course toothpaste and today we are
excited to announce the world and we
have finally created these simplest and
best way to empty tubes the big squeeze
is a patented hand tool specifically
designed to eliminate waste and save you
money on all your tubes here's how it
works take any partially empty tube open
the jaws if you enter the tube in
between the gears squeeze the handles
and turn the crank the gears do all the
work it's that easy all the contents are
pushed forward ensuring to get every
last bit it took many rounds of
prototypes to arrive at the ultimate
solution that we knew it had to feel
comfortable in your hand be extremely
easy to operate so we spent months
fine-tuning the ergonomics for a great
grip and a quality feel it's also
engineered to last a lifetime with die
casting candles and extruded aluminum
gears to handle the toughest of tubes we
are proud to say that the big squeeze
will be backed with a lifetime warranty
and made entirely in the USA it's a tool
just like a can opener it doesn't stay
with the tube you just use it as needed
one big squeeze around your household or
business you have all your tubes and
extended lease on life it's like
squeezing money right back in your
wallet get every single ounce out of all
your tubes help kick-start the big
squeeze today if you're backing the big
squeeze can become a big success thank
you for your support
hey Kickstarter life gets busy life is
good life is fun we all have ordinary
days and once in a while an
extraordinary day they all start the
same you've got to get ready things are
just too complicated there have been
lots of attempts to fix the Bell
something as simple as a belt shouldn't
have a bulky mechanism for adjustments
one step better was a plain webbing belt
the thing is you can't wear that to
every occasion it gets old weaving them
in and out and adjusting them every time
we put them on how many times do you
have to adjust your belt only to use the
exact same hole then you're left with
that flap just a little out of place
hanging out what if the holidays were
good to you and you have to add a hole
just to make your belt work we weren't
okay to just improve the belt so we set
out to make the best belt for you we
wanted a belt you didn't have to cinch
down every time you put it on we wanted
a belt that wasn't big and bulky but
great for every occasion we made
prototype after prototype working out
all the kinks 12 different designs 30
prototypes too many sleepless nights to
count and we've got it perfected with an
aircraft grade aluminum buckle we then
took military-grade webbing and to make
it fit for every occasion we wrapped it
in ballistic nylon we started in a
garage upgraded to the basement and
ended up partnering with some of the
best people in the world Kickstarter
we're excited to bring to you the belt
adjusted low profile and always adjust
it it's the fastest on and off belt out
there it's easy to adjust and once you
have it where you need it it's there
ready to go every time with the best
materials available you don't have to
worry about cracking or stretching we
are offering you black grey and brown
for your fourth color we want you our
backers to help us
Buccos come in four different options to
let you build your belt how you want it
we're the little guy where the reason
kickstarter exists we've done the work
to make this project more than just a
dream our manufacturers are ready to go
and we need your help backers to help us
get over that last hurdle we've taken
the steps to ensure that your rewards
will exceed your expectations help us
launch by buying a venturi belt with
your help we can get this project off
the ground choose your favorite pledge
