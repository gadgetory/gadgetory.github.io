yeah
we never loved
hi I'm Val and I'm chase and we are the
founders of Ava as a foodie I've always
dreamed of having fresh ingredients at
home and growing up and among my
favorite moments were gardening with dad
and harvesting fresh greens from the
garden I grew up cooking in different
restaurants and found that every chef
wanted to have access the freshest
ingredients possible but almost never
had a time space or knowledge to grow
things themselves after becoming an
industrial designer I wanted to create a
sustainable solution we wanted an option
to grow fresh herbs and vegetables
indoors that's compact
smart and designed for modern lifestyle
so that anyone anywhere could grow
anything so we came up with Ava bites we
spent the last two years putting
together an incredible team of plant
scientists designers engineers and
vertical farmers to help bring Ava to
life
we're on a mission to feed the world's
transition to sustainable food and
giving you a new way to connect to
nature at home our dream of having the
perfect indoor smart garden has almost
come to fruition we just need your help
on the final stages of development and
manufacturing to bring Ava bite into
your home so go grab a bite and please

support

sharing this video introducing the white
fox one of the most beautiful and
efficient keyboards we've ever made we
are in put Club the group of keyboard
enthusiast brought together by the
internet with the desire to make the
best keyboards in the world we
collaborated with Matteo Spinelli to
make the white fox a true enthusiast
masterpiece hi my name is Marcus manly
and I'm the father of the white box the
project actually started about five
years ago with a brown brown fox is a
series of keyboards that I designed in
search for the perfect layout but it was
only with the help of input graph that
we were able to remove the next level
aka the white glass the white box works
on Windows Linux and Mac OS due to the
power of the keyboard layout language
software we invented to make our
keyboards more functional than anything
else available because the white box is
completely open source you can customize
the hardware directly from the command
line or by using our simple online
configurator the bespoke keycap set
designed by matteo himself is made from
dye sublimated pvt a favorite
engineering plastic of the online
keyboard community
the keys are extremely fade dust and
fingerprint resistant the body is milled
from a solid block of aircraft-grade
aluminum and the newly invented halo
switches deliver a smooth packed houses
we've already provided the white foxes a
kit you've had to build yourself on mass
drop and there are about 4000 of these
white foxes living out in the web with
this campaign we want to make the white
fox accessible to everyone fully
assembled and ready to go right out of
the box if you love products that people
care about if you support two makers but
you simply want the best tool you'll use
every day please join our campaign and
support the white
