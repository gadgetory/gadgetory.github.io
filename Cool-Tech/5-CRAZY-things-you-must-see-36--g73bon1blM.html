welcome to the state of easy
on average we check our phones over 100
times a day technology is amazing but we
form the dependence on it
it can make us feel stressed isolated
and distracted that's why we created
Kobe a beautiful life that includes a
speech interface and an open-source hub
it's the perfect balance of interior
design and smart home technology a lot
of products are designed for its
stickiness and we just don't think
that's the right approach we care about
how products can affect you positively
your creativity your relationships and
your life with Kobe you can use speech
services like Alexa instead of pausing
to look something up just ask a question
without interrupting your creative
workflow you can even receive the most
important calls directly instead of
digging to app you have a simple way to
control your smart home you can control
multiple devices and create a mood that
put people at ease our natural rhythm is
affected by the quality of light
throughout the day
Koby adapts to your schedule or a better
health that are focused and better sleep
we design Cobie to be China's bringing
together high quality sandblasted glass
with a machined aluminum base at the
center of the light we have a quad-core
computer microphone into the vehicle
Kobe is built on an open source platform
that we contribute to alongside a
growing community
you can connect to your favorite devices
services or counters with the option to
present rules and automate your home
thanks to the support of our backers we
were able to manufacture our first
product we know right here in Germany
the feedback from Marino has gone
directly into the development of Cobie
helping us to take a major step towards
creating a smart home experience that
truly promotes well-being we're in a
moment where we must take responsibility
for making technology that puts people
first so join our mission to create
products that are designed for
well-being by backing us today

experience is the sound
introducing Sony camp the first
professional 360 degree video camera
which not only films amazingly to its 9
4k cameras but it also records the sound
in boundless decks with its 64 built-in
microphones giving you an experience
that will almost make you shiver sony
cams team has studied how we perceive
sound in reality using these studies we
came up with the perfect algorithm for
capturing unique sound fields that can
be played on any type of sound system

surrounded by 50 speakers even if you're
just listening with your headphones Sony
camps immersive audio technology goes
way beyond that of the standard 5.1
surround sound it creates that lifelike
experience using this beamforming
microphone array so you always know
where the sound is coming from from how
far away and the frequency don't worry
at Sony camp we haven't forgotten
to insure an embedded noise reduction
feature Sony cam focuses on recording
the sound you need not that of those
unnecessary background noises Sony Camp
uniquely recreates the exact scene that
was filmed guaranteeing you that you
will always receive the precise
impression of where the video was taken
Sony can pin points down position
exactly so wherever you turn your head
when listening your sound system will
refabricate the exact sound for your
location sony cam is easy
it only has three buttons the rest is
controlled by an app don't forget that
Sony camp provides you with a real-time
audio and video preview ensuring you are
always in control of what's being filmed

before for stitching Sony camp does it
all for you simply click on playback and
start editing straight

never felt it before we're thrilled and
excited to bring this new reality to you
