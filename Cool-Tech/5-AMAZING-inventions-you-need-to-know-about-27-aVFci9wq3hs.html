i spent seven years working as a
mechanic so I saw firsthand the kind of
handheld lights and area lights that
were being used they were cheap with dim
underpowered bulbs and flimsy
construction I'd constantly be buying
new ones because they always fell apart
even with newer LED lights the
electronics often broke creating an
unreliable life I remember thinking then
that car shops deserved a better life
and so did truckers electricians first
responders anyone else who works with
their hands when I started working at
big ass solutions I knew this was a
project that I wanted to pursue I came
up with a rough concept a handheld area
light that was bright cordless portable
durable a life that was over engineered
to stand up to years of abuse and harsh
conditions I pitched the idea to our CEO
Carrie Smith and he actually encouraged
me to pursue this project and see where
it led and now after two years and
countless hours of work we have the big
ass light bar we wanted a life that was
bright as hell with 5,000 lumen at
maximum output it's everything you need
up to 48 hours of continuous light on
battery power the light bar itself is
made of a chemically resistant sitel
glass filled nylon that means that you
can spray it off with common chemicals
the shape of the light itself was
actually designed to prevent it from
rolling away if you dropped it or set it
on the hood of a car
with its ip66 rating you can take it
outside and not worry if it gets rained
on we know that you were going to toss
around the life on so we over molded it
in key areas with the technology called
versa flex to be shock absorbent

granted yet our eyes are one of our most
precious senses having healthy eyes not

how we feel at work and at play but most
of us don't see our off tomm at risk
nearly as often as we should or as
regularly as we see our dentist now
