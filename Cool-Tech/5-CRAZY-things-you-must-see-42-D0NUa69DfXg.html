fill in the technical video let's tackle
it's my invention so holding it all in
one mouth for your phone or camera six
there are two verbs that describe what a
plane does there's flying and there's
flying meet powerup darts a paper
airplane that's not just flying it's
flying
this is shy a pilot industrial designer
and inventor shine loves everything
airborne four years ago he was
challenged by a friend to create a
smartphone controlled paper airplane
which I accepted the challenge and
created powerup 3 the first ever
smartphone controlled paper airplane
then two years ago that same friend
challenged him to put a camera on the
plane so shy created powerup fpv the
first-ever smartphone controlled paper
airplane with a streaming camera shy
friend looked at those creations and
said cool but you can't make a paper
plane that can do a loop and a barrel
roll and then stall turn then just i
stopped his friend before he
hyperventilated and said challenge
accepted
now after a year of prototyping and
testing its here power op dart the first
ever smartphone control paper airplane
that can do aerobatics yes other planes
can fly but they can't loop or barrel
roll or fly vertically dart can it is
incredible and it is small just take a
piece of paper fold it into a plane
catch the module download the app and
tell your friends jeepers got nothing on
you you're an aerobatic pilot now power
up dark gets its incredible aerobatic
capability from the high
thrust-to-weight ratio and unique shape
of the plane despite being so incredible
why the dart is easy and intuitive move
the phone to any direction and the wings
will follow when you start the plane
goes to 70% of its throttle so you can
fly it like a regular plan but press the
boost button and you give the plane that
extra kick that transforms it into a
flying monster a small flying monster
power-ups bluetooth module easily
charges through its microUSB port and
the entire thing is made of carbon fiber
an island so it's nearly indestructible
dart invites you to make many planes in
many shapes because every plane brings
with it new tricks and with them new
gasps for air try 5 10 50 planes then
fly them all together make a real show
arrange dogfights break every barrier
previously set by less incredible planes
and this little bugger is so cool it can
even fly around the office yeah you just
sent a love note through a smart phone
control paper airplane you have lived
powerup dart is ready for production so
if you want to fly aerobatics with the
most incredible all incredible planes
