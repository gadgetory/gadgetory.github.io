specifically designed for yoga just one
pound apiece they add a constant and
consistent resistance to airflow helping
to build strength and balance over time
tradition dumbbells are commonly used in
cotton but they limit the full
expression of your probe and your
practice there has to be a better way so
if we enlisted the help of an industrial
designer to develop a one-size-fits-all
solution that won't require smaller
bangles are made of high quality fitness
disease particularly designed for
comfort and performance
each bar the cap iron corks and it's
covered in medical grade silicone larger
colonies and aquatic elastic that allow
them to be worn by both men and women on
both wrists and ankles we developed the
first prototype and in the process we
created strong relationships for their
manufacturing partners but we need your
help our goal is to raise $40,000 for
our first production help you strengthen
your practice without energy it's hard
to keep momentum when you're on the move
you need power the moves with you we've
made layer for this purpose it's a
Bluetooth enabled laptop sleeve which
can charge your laptop PC or Mac
smartphone and tablet simultaneously
wherever you are
it has wireless charging tracking with
tracker on you SGC so instead of having
to pack chargers adapters and caravans
you just bring land when charging your
devices at night you can charge all of
them by letter in just one socket so
when you're heading out you just grab
layer with your device is already inside
and charge along with the both and
battery and if you're traveling it may
be the only thing you need as it has
adapters for every country Blair isn't
just a battery it's a solution which
allows you to keep momentum throughout
your day and stay in charge I used to
travel a lot for work and I was always
in need of a product like Lehr power
banks are great for quick phone charges
but it wasn't a solution for all of my
devices in the end it was just another
thing I had to worry about so I brought
a team together to find a solution with
years of experience in technology and
product design there was the end result
and it's the first of its kind
we also wanted to create something that
would look beautiful and we stand out
from the average laptops leave the
closure system we design a largest
Aquila sleeve as compact as possible
expanding only when you need to the
battery can be changed or replaced we
wanted that to expand the lifespan of
the product and we include international
adapters so you can use the product
anywhere we're using a composite
material specifically designed for layer
which provides durability cushioning and
protection from scratches it was
important operate offered all the
functionality our users would need
charging all devices not just some it
has DC charging for PCs and Macs along
with USB see for newer laptops and
phones for everything else we've
included a USB port with quick charge
anyone can work layer we like easy to
use out and you'll never lose it because
it's trackable we're a small team but we
have a great history of premium polish
to market we built our prototype and now
we need the funding to scale and
manufacture the product we're really
tired of learn the quality in the
solution of providing and we can wait
together hello everyone my name is Jack
I'm the inventor of the Sydney
rangefinder the project started out last
year is just an idea I used an Arduino
and some off-the-shelf components to
test the concept and after programming
it and making sure it worked I shared
the idea of a few filmmaking buddies
after getting a lot of interest I spent
the first few months of 2017 working
hard on developing the idea from the
concept or fully working prototype
I designed the circuit boards and got
them manufactured as well as designed
and manufactured my own case using a 3d
printer for SCID the next types of tests
in the studio as well as on location for
a shoe I have got some great results
from it and has already helped me in
other people with their folks pulling
them on shoes the software for it is
already done
it allows you to change settings such as
moving the datum line offset back and
forth between between metric and
imperial set the display brightness as
well as the wireless channel for a
future accessory and finally reset the
device we have already entered the final
stage of development and with your help
as a backer we
is manufactured and into your hand
surely thanks for watching and check us
out on IndieGoGo
I created the boozy bucket because I've
been in the outdoors my whole life and I
love all kinds of outdoors activities
there's a lot of products that are too
expensive there's a lot of products that
just don't hold up to the youth that we
put them through and I wanted to create
a product that was multi-purpose
extremely durable and affordable it's
just for average folks like me and you
it's a great companion to have with you
no matter what your activity is the
outer shell is a boozy bucket is
thousands in you're like an army duffel
bag it's got water proof and rust proof
zippers it will carry all your gear your
all your accessories it's insulated
doesn't leak and you can even hang a
narrator on it use it as a bait bucket
the boozy bucket is a great soft sided
cooler you had any 5-gallon bucket the
patent-pending lid now it's a hard core
even makes a great seat so whether
you're hunting fishing camping going to
the beach or your kids game tailgating
or barbecuing with your friends don't
forget to bring your original boozy
bucket

make or break your day a paper wallet we
strive to provide you with the right
tools to keep your day running smoothly

efficiency minimal bulk we strive to
find the perfect solutions for you to
carry what you need and now we're taking
it one step further and designing
comfort for the most uncomfortable form
of money we've researched existing
solutions tested materials and designed
dozens of prototypes to develop an easy
and comfortable way to handle coins and

that we have solved the mystery of that
tiny pocket in the pair of jeans you're
