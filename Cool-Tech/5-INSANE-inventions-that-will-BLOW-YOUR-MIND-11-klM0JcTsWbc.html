been a really fidgety person my whole
life and with my love of magnets and
titanium I wanted to combine that
together to make a device that you could
carry with you and keep you busy all the
time and it wasn't just a hand spinner
it was something that you could take
apart and click and move around and
fiddle with in your hands it was
completely absorbing at the same time

actually put one together when we have
