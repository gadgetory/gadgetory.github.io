kind of taking my mind off of the fact
that my hands are moving constantly I
love it I can't put it down well I've
been a really fidgety person my whole
life and with my love of magnets and
titanium I wanted to combine that
together to make a device that you could
carry with you and keep you busy all the
time and it wasn't just a hand spinner
it was something that you could take
apart and click and move around and
fiddle with in your hands it was
completely absorbing at the same time
and I think he's definitely tuned that
was over later I was the first one to
actually put one together when we have
it we had all the materials and the
parts and the first fidget itself right
