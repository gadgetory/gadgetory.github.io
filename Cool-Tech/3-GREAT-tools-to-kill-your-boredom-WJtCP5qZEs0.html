I'd always suspected those around me had
seen my incessant pen clicking me
shaking and desk tapping but i had no
idea how bad their gotten i just
fidgeted all the time with anything I
could get my hands on didn't matter what
a bubble wrap a bubble wrap the way a
pop pop popped
I just couldn't get enough that was
probably oughta thankfully my
Kickstarter community
from the people that brought you to add
comes over the counter fidget cube edge
acute is a vinyl desk toy designed to
satisfy any urges to click roll spin and
other common fidgety impulses without
driving your colleagues and loved ones
away
the cube is a cube that you fidget with
studies have suggested that fidgeting
increases focus and improves
productivity side effects may include a
sudden ability to cope with boring
meetings pay attention in class power
through netflix marathons budget cube is
designed to allow discrete vegetate in
any setting do not use fidget cube if
you have an aversion to rectangular
prisms didja cube let's be satisfy my
fidgeting without endlessly annoying
those around me I thought I could stop
at any time and now I realize I don't
want to fidget cube can help take the
first step to fidget in freedom today
okay so in all seriousness we make joke
about fidgeting and we give our friends
and co-workers a hard time for the pen
clicking and the nail-biting but what if
there aren't simple what opinion is a
coping mechanism a way for us to stay
focused and more present in the moment
sometimes is smarter than us believe
that we have this thing called floating
attention which makes it hard for us to
focus in certain circumstances okay hey
Mark yeah yeah and actually fidgety has
been shown to be able to help keep that
blows in attention occupied which helps
you better focus on the task at hand
what's maybe even a little crazier is
that some recent studies have suggested
that students who use fidgeting as a
mechanism during testing tend to perform
better on those tests than when their
hearts itself Bridget Cube has been a
project we've dreamt about for almost
four years now and we're excited to
finally be bringing it to you it's been
a long road with a lot of prototypes but
we think you're going
when designing fidget cube we wanted to
ensure two things first the
functionality needed to truly satisfy
fidgeting needs it needed to be an
entire toolbox of fidgety options while
staying small and compact which leads us
to our second and equally important
priority we wanted fidget cube to be a
premium desk toy that could be
discreetly used in any situation from a
classroom to a boardroom the fidgets
cube of course has six sides
you really think pejic you has so many
different applications and we're so
important to you trying out lockers
thank you so much for your support
pelvis ticks always had potential to be
a lot of fun growing up but the
technology just wasn't good enough to
let us do what we really wanted back in
1997 we set out to turn pogo sticks into
a whole new sport our concept was based
on the idea of having a portable
trampoline something you can jump 36 but
even Ken feet high on but also take
anywhere you want to go the v4 is the
portable trampoline we'd always dreamed
up with the v4 you have the ability to
add a remove there and completely change
the stiffness of the bounce someone who
weighs 300 pounds can jump on the same
exact v4 as someone who only weighs 80
pounds all you need to do is change the
air pressure in less than a minute you
can perfectly tuned the v4 to each
writers preferences pumping more air in
to jump higher and taking air out to
jump lower this makes sharing it with
friends and family of fun-filled
experience that everyone can enjoy you
can also collapse the v4 to make
transportation a breeze whether you're a
pro or just stepping on to the v4 for
the very first time you'll love the
weightless flight like experience you'll
get the basics in minutes and from that
point on there's no limit to how far you
can challenge yourself with the v4
you'll be able to jump up onto ledges
downstairs and over gaps of all sizes
while nailing down some pretty awesome
tricks after playing around on the v4
you'll never look at your surroundings
in the same way again obstacles and
features that are too high for bikes and
skateboards a perfect for the v4 so
those of you looking for a fun way to
stay in shape the v4 will work most of
the muscle groups in your body and get
your heart pounding immediately it's a
killer cardio workout and the best part
is that while you're having fun bouncing
around you won't even realize how
quickly you build a sweat in order to
achieve superior build quality and
maintain the high tolerance is necessary
for the v4 to work we manufacture and
assemble it right here in our Southern
California shop we work closely with our
suppliers to become a part of the build
process and as each component is made or
right there to test them
this streamlines are manufacturing and
ensures that every v4 we make is up to
our standards if you're looking for the
portable trampoline that we always
dreamed of v4 is going to knock your
socks off whether you want to use it
simply for exercise or to jump eight
feet high and do crazy tricks on is up
you and we know you'll love every second
of it join us and help change the way
pogo sticks racine forever
you
for most of us there are countless times
in a single day where we feel nervous
anxious or not our best sometimes even
the subtlest moments can have our body
reacting with fight or flight and we
don't even realize that it's happening

resist owned by doing this throughout

high-powered CEOs to lung slimming the
Himalayan mountains and for the last two
years we've been working stanford and
ucsf collisions to make a tool that
really works we're really excited to get
this into your heads our early users
love it and our manufacturing supply
chain is all set up but we can't do
without your support so thank you for
checking out our project and backing us
