yourself one question am i achieving my

take a moment are you ready to
experience your most memorable moment
yet
imagine a world where sound quality has
been redefined by AI and smart volume
alerts are shared with you in real-time
the intelligence in these wireless
headphones constantly examines and
reacts to your music surroundings and
listening habits the algorithm actively
aggregates frequencies volume levels and
instruments in your music before
determining how to enhance your
listening experience by adding more
clarity depth and spaciousness the music
is then channeled to two revolutionary
speaker drivers completely redesigned
they have superior sound accuracy and up
to three times less total harmonic
distortion
when compared to similar high
performance drivers you will be able to
experience the most natural audio with
the cleanest bass the AI acts as the
listening guardian for your ears it
continuously monitors your volume
exposure every five seconds and
communicates with you when it feels you
are at risk of noise induced hearing
loss
utilizing a decibel warning alert or an
automatic volume adjustment as per the
user's preference the advanced noise
cancellation actively harmonizes your
surroundings by blocking out unwanted
noise immersing you in a pure audio
experience we have a long and rich
history of designing audio products that
have been embraced by music lovers and
critical listeners all around the world
because music matters so much in our
lives with artificial intelligence we
are elevating your listening experience
to something that's more enjoyable
precise clearer and smart
together we can upgrade the future of
audio yeah okay that sounds good I'll
see you in a bit so you might not been
able to hear that but using Ori I was
able to have a call and that's because
Ori is a voice assistant ring that turns
your finger into a smart phone all
through just a touch of the ear but why
that's because the way in which we're
using our devices is changing changing
from a world where we use screens and
touch to one where we talk now Ori uses
bone conduction and bone conduction has
been used in many medical grade devices
we package it in a way that ascends
vibrations through your finger directly
into years so only you can hear and that
allows you to hear and talk to just your
finger amen that's music and thanks to
bone conduction and the dual noise
cancelling microphone you can hear and
talk even and loud places
so check this out
or is perfectly private and discreet
using it mixing futures like a secret
application Inori
is more than just a neat gadget for
taking and making calls because behind
it is powerful voice artificial
intelligence our friend Siri and Google
assistant it puts them exactly where you
need them think about all the different
things that you can do and one of my
favorite translation all we have to do
is just motion upwards and you say Ori
how do I say where are the burritos in
Spanish understand lost burritos and
just like burritos come in different
flavors Ori comes in three different
colors I guarantee you there's an Oreo
ring for every outfit and every occasion
and even better Ori is splash proof too
look guys I know how popular you are and
that's why you have the Horry app
because it helps you filter out
everything else and there's four LED
lights that tell you what kind of
messages are coming through come on
let's hit the streets to see what people
think of or a bit of a party starter
let's put it that way that's what he's
been doing for the past 20 years and
he's becoming pretty damn good at it
well I wish this story was all fun and
games but sometimes you got to take
action to preserve your body mics ears
are paying the price whenever he is
DJing and producing he feels fatigue
pain and loss of sensitivity but not
anymore
now he uses Dee but a pleasant let sound
in and keeps noise out ha what is this
debug thing you ask Zee but is what
saved Mike from imminent silence and can
save a lot of other people featuring a
slider that allows you to adjust to the
amount of decibels you want to filter
out Dee bud gives you a clearer crisper
and safer music experience what's the
difference between D but and a regular
ear plug you might ask well here's some
scientific explanation your ear is
designed to naturally boost frequencies
around 2 to 4 kilo Hertz like human
speech most ear plugs simply fill out
your ear canal to block sound problem is
that they alter your years resonance
frequency causing muffled unclear
hearing as a result with dee buds you
can speak feel listen
we do exactly what you used to do our
acoustic mesh is designed to reduce
volume evenly for all frequencies
throughout the spectrum while the
acoustic or mechanically enhances
frequencies in the range of human speech
d-bus simply brings you clears a sound
for Mike this was a decision that
dramatically changed the quality of his
life with a simple slide and he is
telling all his friends about it
