the paper shooters construction tip
torre blaster since then we sold
thousands of blasters shift millions of
spit balls and are stocked in major
retailers all around the world now we're
back with a new range that you don't
need to fill spit ball blasters these
are all plastic fully assembled and
shoot straight out of the box spit ball
blasters raises the bar for projectile
based to a comment by utilizing our 100%
biodegradable and readily available
tissue paper is amma now you'll never
need to buy more ammo or threat to that
black let's take a look at how it works
simply take a piece of tissue paper and
roll it into a tube next snip off one
centimeter pieces then dip each piece in
water and place inside the mold Sabbats
finally compress the mold and there you
go perfect results every time
load the ammo into the shelf then into
the magnet the ammo sticks to the target
and three wimps out there they don't
hurt if you get hit the assault rifle at
spit ball blasters SB 9000 allows you to
black 100% biodegradable spit ball that
you can make yourself from ordinary
tissue with the ability to hit targets
up to 65 feet away the blasters feature
awesome paint jobs and thanks to the
unique cocking system also offer real
triggers and ejecting shells in addition
they feature a flip clip which allows
for 16 shots without realllly
meaning you will own the battlefield we
also include the brass catcher so you
don't need to worry about quite when the
show we've been working on this project
for almost two years going from idea the
sketches to working prototypes the
tooling is finalized and our
manufacturing partners are in place to
commence production as soon as we hit
our goal you can want to turn ordinary
tissues into endless file degradable
ammo then blasted up to 65 feet then

close to the head there is a
revolutionary intelligent health there
is the new point and region of children
she's like more powerful we believe that
there will be a better health as
managing your health daily and we truly
respect private data for to us with
their health we put in the new place
developed a better product to change our
daily life making telling easier than
ever we all have a bedtime ritual for
most of us never for clear healthier
skin but then we thought about what
happens afterwards why are we laying our
fresh faces onto a pillowcase that
hasn't been washed in days
it turns out the average pillowcase is a
breeding ground for bacteria
in fact studies have shown that the
bacteria found on pillowcases is no
different from that on
this bacteria builds up over time and
can be harmful to your skin and overall
well-being dermatologists recommend
washing your pillowcase every two or
three days who has time for that we sure
don't and we don't know anyone who does
introducing the Silvan pillowcase
Silvan provides you with a clean
sleeping surface each and every night
here's how it works
Silvan uses pure natural silver to
prevent bacterial growth liner
pillowcase advanced technology now
allows us to weave silver coated thread
into our fabric these silver threads are
up to 99% effective in controlling
bacteria on your entire pillow case the
average pillowcase continues to
accumulate bacteria over time
Silvan shows a 99 percent reduction in
pathogens within the first hour and
continue to prevent bacterial growth
night after night let's take it back to
high school chemistry silver carries a
positive charge bacteria is negative the
solar is attracted the bacteria break
the cell wall and the bacteria is
destroyed before it has a chance to
reproduce silver occurs naturally in the
earth and it's been used for centuries
of the purifying agent today this
technology is used by health care
facilities and even NASA for its
antibacterial properties no harsh
chemicals no nanotechnology those were
our guidelines we've partnered with an
american-based
antimicrobial technology company that
uses natural silver to prevent bacterial
growth on textile their proprietary
process completely covers advanced
fibers and silver while allowing them to
remain extremely soft flexible and
comfortable similar products use harsh
chemical treatments in their
antibacterial effects weaken over time
but because the silver is woven right
into our fabric it will not wash out and
engraven straight even after 200 washes
a pillowcase will be just as effective
as
one in a pillowcase isn't much good if
it's not comfortable that's why we
combine our technology with long staples
- pima cotton 100% of this cotton is
grown in the US and is among the softest
most durable cotton delivery with
holistic skin care and overall
well-being in mind we have created a
pillowcase as part of the solution not
the problem we want to bring textile
innovations to the bedroom and believe
that Silvan is a product that everyone
can benefit from the average pillowcase
is squirming of bacteria and so line
keeps bacteria in check no more sleeping
on a dirty pillow case we're a team of
engineers and designers we believe the
fabric you rest on should be more than
just an afterthought we know from
experience our goes into manufacturing
this product we just need your support
to make it happen

hello I'm Chuck Martin general manager
of innovation here at Bissell if this
will we no pets and the message they
make around the home and when it's time
to bathe them the message they get even
bigger we focus on cleaning up the
messes that life brings including the
pet messes now we're bringing these
insights to the dog bathing process the
Bissell bark bath truly is the next
generation of bathing your dog a faster
easier and less messy way this will
strengths are really around
understanding the consumer in the needs
of the consumer especially the pet
parent and we know pets we know how pets
interact with the household and the
messages they make in a home we realized
that people are very frustrated with the
bathing process and we took a look at
that and we thought well if we're
cleaning up after the dogs when they
come into the house and they leave spots
and stains in the carpet and upholstery
and when never really addressing the
animal itself that is dirty we started
taking a look at the technology and the
knowledge we had of both pets and
cleaning and we found this great new
idea and if you concept about saving
your animal anywhere in your home so
marrying the insights that we have
around the consumer experience and
around the consumer with the engineering
now is the perfect match as we know pet
you know pet parents we know messes we
know dirt spark bath is really important
because it gives the consumer a new way
outside of their traditional way of
bathing to actually bathe their dog
anywhere in the home that they want
whenever they want what it also allows
people to do is clean more frequently in
ten minutes I can have all three dogs
just just those light cleaning and the
smell goes away and everything I mean it
works great if if you could actually
bathe your dog every other day if you
wanted to and it wouldn't be a chore or
were before it was a charge of a three
dog you can use it in your kitchen and
just within less than ten minutes you
can wash your dog this is different
because we're actually changing the way
that you wash the animal normally you
would wash from the fur down and what
we're doing is we're cleaning from the
skin up that's how we can actually use
less water because in the traditional
bathtub method of washing your dog you
use about 19
of water to washing 80-pound dog we use
less than 48 ounces of water because
we're much more efficient at the process
so our nohrin shampoo is really unique
because it doesn't have a lot of the
harsh chemicals that other shampoos -
and it's really safe and effective on
the animal are you going to give himself
a ball it was perfect
there was no mess and that was about an
hour shorter than what it would have
taken me to give him a normal bath it
was great and he dried a lot faster when
I first saw the product I thought there
was no way that this was actually going
to work on Oreo she's got too much hair
it really really worked good it's better
for the homeowner because they'll use a
lot less water it's better for the
homeowner because they won't have to
wrestle the dog to get them in and out
of the bathtub and it really delivers on
the promise that's supposed to give to
the pet parent which is we're going to
take care of your dog in a way that's
never been done it's easier for you and
easier for your dog please join us in
this new adventure in caring for your
dog be one of the first to get your bark
bath order now and keep checking back
with us as we'll be posting new videos
and updates
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
