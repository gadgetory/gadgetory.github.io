send and receive messages browse through
news feeds Trek fitness stats and much
more all directly on my wrist all on its
own here's a pocket screen much like a
mouse a keyboard or a monitor this
pocket screen is simply an interface for
my hub it's not very smart it doesn't
need to be if I need a bigger screen I
can grab a tab screen or i can plug it
into this keyboard if i want to be more
productive i can even use this dongle to
turn any existing TV into another screen
for my wrist now that i'm always using
the same computing hub I can start an
application on one screen and seamlessly
continue it on another if I lose a
screen no worries it has none of my
personal stuff and because these screens
are inexpensive and can be everywhere
all I ever need to carry is my hump
you
okay so all of us on a few phone
accessories right and some of them can
actually do some really impressive
things but right now if I asked you to
get one you'd probably say I don't have
it with me so most of the time you end
up leaning your phone against some
random object instead of actually using
that expensive tripod that you left at
home so because there weren't any real
solutions we made our own and back in
2013 we launched our first Kickstarter
campaign for the pocket tripod a fully
adjustable stand for your iphone and
holds our device in both portrait and
landscape without covering the screen
best part is that it transforms into the
size of a couple of credit cards and
hides away in any wallet or purse until
you need it again people loved it we
raised more than our funding goal by
almost double and even Apple co-founder
Steve Wozniak the was said why didn't
someone do this before what a great idea
that I wish I thought I put one of them
in my backpack which is always with but
then a few of our very clever backers
realize something that we missed who
told us I've got a case on my phone I'm
not going to take it off every time
that's just too much work and someone
else said so what you guys some kind of
Apple fanboys you know some people rock
Android right back got us thinking can't
make a pocket tripod for every phone
case bottle out there there's at least a
million different combinations who knows
so as soon as we shipped all rewards to
our two and a half thousand backers we
started working on a universal pocket
tripod instead of limiting it to only
bear iPhones
for months we studied case designs got
feedback from our backers and tested
ideas once we had a universal opening
shape we made it in a range of sizes so
that it fits as many case in phone
combinations possible this is the new
universal pocket tripod does it work
with the Apple silicone case perfectly
how about the Galaxy Note yep works
fantastic and landscape and halfway in
portrait does it work with every case
almost unless it's gigantic we've also
created this guide that lets you know
exactly what pocket tripod you need just
by knowing what case and device
combination okay but what if I like it
bare but also sometimes with protection
do any two pocket tripods nope because
whenever you swap your case or your
phone you can also get the adapters to
match their new size good to go the
pocket tripods been used and tested for
the past two years by thousands of
people worldwide
they use it as the primary tripod every
day to take amazing timelapses for
making video calls and even to create
light paintings we've made the pocket
tripod with the highest standards of
engineering materials and manufacturing
they say the best camera is the one
that's with you and the same is true
when it comes to tripods the pocket
tripod is now a proven product and with
your help we want to make it one of the
most practical smartphone accessories
for as many people as we can we hope you
join us thank you
two minutes three times a day for your
whole life have you ever thought about
how much time in your life you spend
brushing your teeth how many other
wonderful things could you do in this
time
I'm Aldo de Medici let me in my ten
years experience as a dentist I got
clear evidence of how prevention is the
key in oral health but you would never
imagine that most of the problems
originate from an incorrect tooth
brushing technique today for us it is
unacceptable that children can make
mistakes brushing their teeth the adults
still don't dedicate enough time to do
it properly that the elderly lack an
effective device for prevention we want
everyone to be able to brush their teeth
in a simple fast but mostly an effective
way that's why we invented glare smile
glare smile is the first toothbrush
which thanks to three brushes
automatically removes dental plaque the
correct way what you need to do to brush
all your teeth is to simply slide it for
10 seconds along your dental arches
using glare smile you won't risk
mistakes and you'll save a lot of
precious time in your life
I believed in this project from the very
beginning as I wanted to be the first
one to try glare smile so creating a
device which could improve our everyday
life was a fascinating challenge we
engaged in the development of the
product by addressing the problems of
hundreds of patients and by studying the
correct brushing movement with several
laboratory tests and we developed a
brand new unusual design one hundred
percent made in italy forget your usual
toothbrush it is absolutely
user-friendly you can start and stop it
with a single button but also select
many functions with a large touchscreen
display such as four different preset
brushing modes it comes with
interchangeable brushes with the size
for adults and a size four children and
has a countdown which alerts when it is
time to change them a UV LED to kill
bacteria automatically activates when it
is switched off and the removable cap
provides a mechanic cleaning mode for
brushes with rechargeable batteries a
USB charger and a docking station it
will always be ready to use furthermore
glare smile is also eco-friendly thanks
to recyclable materials and a solar
charger you can connect glare smile to
an app which shows you the usage
statistics so that as a mother you can
be sure that your children are brushing
the right way we want to create a true
revolution in oral health to make sure
that everyone from children to adults to
the elderly can have guaranteed oral
prevention always we've already put a
lot of effort in research tests and in
developing many prototypes to create the
final product our need now is to build
the critical mass to face the
investments of mass production reaching
the campaign goal with your help will
enable the manufacturing of the first
batch so that you could be among the
first to try glare smile glare smile
will let you discover how simple and
fast it can be to brush your teeth the
right way
Claire smile the simplicity of your
smile
oh hello how are you doing today because
I'm feeling great the spread you've just
seen when I woke up was an energizing
essential oil and the beautiful item

smart diffuser it allows you to enjoy a
hundred percent natural and organic
essential oils virtues and it's
extremely simple do you want to know
more let me show you
essential oils can help you well being
in many ways for example if I was
working for two hours I would start to
have a serious headache so here is how
to simply set a new capsule that's it
and we're ready to go for a month when I
set or change a capsule on the diffuser
the app will instantly detect which one
it is in this case I've plucked the
clear head capsule in oh and look it's
already on my screen voila bye-bye
headache Oh haven't I told you I can
also control you Mia from my SmartWatch
but even better it can start spreading
automatically that way when tebow comes
back from work he doesn't even need to
think about his relax capsule Lumia
mobile app learns from you to automate
the diffusion matching your mood and
schedule it also asks the volume of your
rooms to spread the perfect amount of
oils as well as contraindications to
always guarantee absolute safety
beyond their benefits on well-being
essential oils have all a specific
perfume that you can use just to set up
the atmosphere you want and now that you
know the product let me introduce the
team behind these wonderful projects
diffusers haven't evolved in decades we
wanted to make one extremely simple to
use so everyone could benefit from
essential oils and we've developed remy
f diffuser along with experts a lot of
people around us including ourselves

goodbye and start to sleep capsule no
way this is not how the video is
supposed to end now you know everything
and it's time for me to start the routes
cups too
you
hallam gani device works you install the
limca new device as high as you can
reach flush against the wall one meter
away from your cooking area the Loom
gonna fire detector is a heat detector
and not a smoke detector what that means
is that the device is completely
insensitive to smoke and therefore false
alarms are greatly reduced as cooking
lighting and heating methods are
predominantly slowed based and informal
settlements the device is a rate of rise
of temperature detector which means it
doesn't measure how hots our home is it
measures how quickly our home gets hot
for example home except during the
course of the day over a few hours in a
dangerous fire situation room
temperatures radically increase in
seconds this is what our fire detector
is designed to detect
in the event of a fire it divides sounds
an alarm with one Long Beach alerting
the SAT me to the danger and allowing
them to deal with the fire before it
becomes unmanageable our devices are
networked to heat the texts after 20
seconds and the device has not been
meted the device will send a signal to
all devices within a 60 meter radius of
the danger causing them to ring with a
different turn creating a community wide
alert to the danger this is to address
the spreading of fires which can take
minutes to destroy a community homes
which are both from highly flammable
materials and both so close together
this critical early warning enables
communities to respond to the fire
before they reach disaster stage we have
created smart devices which we install
in this nation network which are
designed to pick up the signal in the
network and send text messages to
community members in real time warning
them of the danger even if they're not
in their homes or neighborhoods
these smart devices gather locational
information of the fire which can be
used to send to fire departments
enabling them to be more proactive and
give them exact GPS to answer of the
fire they do not need to rely on calls
and directions in order to get to the
scene of the danger in the quickest time
possible
