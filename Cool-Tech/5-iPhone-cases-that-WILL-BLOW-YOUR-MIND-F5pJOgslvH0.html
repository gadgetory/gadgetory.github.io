we are Mouse
and we've designed a phone case that can
do this this is quite scary I mean is my
iPhone 7 ready and they look like this
we found that slim phone cases weren't
that protective and protective phone
cases are ugly so we designed a lot of
phone cases carbon-fibre ones metal ones
curved ones wooden ones leather ones you
name it we designed it and we tested
them on real iPhones some survived
always worth
and some didn't Kiko expensive but in
the end we did it
introducing limitless by mouse a slim
phone case with serious engineering that
hasn't compromised on looks walnut
bamboo black marble black leather matte
grey Kevlar carbon fiber this is
London's Waterloo Bridge a 35 foot drop
here we go
not even a scratch how because we've
engineered an advance impact material
aero shop it's inside all our phone
cases this unique polymer contains
thousands of micro air pockets that
absorb the impact a ball bearing the
drop some regular plastic bounces but on
arrow shock the energy is absorbed the
same thing happens in our phone cases
all our cases are seriously protective
so protective we've dropped it from a
crane onto concrete from 45 feet
all our cases have a steel plate built
into the back and they come with a free
magnetic wall mount for backers they fit
both the iPhone six and seven so you
don't have to upgrade your case the same
applies for the six plus and the seven
plus here you can see our tools making
our cases using our own materials
when the new iPhone was released we saw
it as the pinnacle of modern design and
technology but then we saw the iPhone
battery case it's bulky and it looks
ugly just like all the others we asked
ourselves could it be better
the answer was yes and so we invented
thin case thin case is the world's
thinnest all-in-one iPhone battery case
this incredibly thin protective case
that's just five millimeters of
thickness to your iPhone it's extremely
durable and offers maximum protection
every case has a raised front lip that
works as a shield to prevent the screen
from hitting the ground when
accidentally dropped on top of that it's
unique design folds out into a kickstand
allowing for hands-free usage any time
thin case is super powerful with 3000
milliamp s-- you have more than double
your iPhone's battery life
that's 14 more hours of video games
movies are talktime and more than 40
hours of music listening and speaking of
listening to music with the introduction
of iPhone 7 you may be missing your
favorite pair of headphones so thin case
brings back the 3.5 millimeter audio
jack now you can charge your phone and
listen to music at the same time just
like the old days
thin case is also intelligent equipped
with modern charge through technology
thin case enables charge and sync
functions while connected to a computer
your iPhone recharges first and then the
thin case recharges itself the LED power
indicator lets you know at a glance how
much juice is left
install thin case in a single click and
rest easy knowing your iPhone will never
let you down again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
