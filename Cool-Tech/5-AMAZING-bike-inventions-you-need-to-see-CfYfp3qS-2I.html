of this integrated in a performance
helmet that is comfortable aerodynamic
and cool the Kouros links smart cycling
helmet the ultimate audio platform for
cyclists
you
what if all cars had a single light in
the center strange then why do we only
have one light in front of our bicycle
introducing luma a 360 degree light
system that shows your true width while
cycling it combines all the lights
needed on your bike front lights rear
lights and side lights all integrated
into the bicycles grips three different
lights at each end of your handlebar
never worry again about leaving your
lights home or having them stolen the
grips feature a solid core for easy
installation and lock-on rings for
secure fastening luma meets all the
legal requirements even in countries
with strict regulations such as Denmark
or Norway though it makes you visible
luma itself is almost invisible it has a
compact elegant design that does not
interfere with the looks of your bike
the body is made of aircraft-grade
aluminum the same alloy used for
helicopters and airplanes it's tough
almost indestructible we've paid special
attention to the surface finish anodized
ultra sonic cleaned and hand brushed for
a premium look finally each set comes
with built-in lithium batteries that are
easily charged through a standard
microUSB port
we love bicycles and we love to cycle we
want to have a product that is not just
good but one that advances the frontiers
of visibility and traffic safety help us
spread the word and save the world
get a luma for someone you care for it's
not just the light it's all you need to
see and be
scene
every bike frame stacks 207 folded
layers which leads to a light yet stiff
bike frame the same carbon fiber
material is used in the military and
aerospace we designed our integrated
cycling computers
our road bike is designed with
interchangeable integrated plates
aesthetics and performance while
designing the leopard we push boundaries
leading through before our bike is
aerodynamic and doesn't have visible
wires at all reducing air resistance and
maximizing style
do you remember the first time you
rode a bike the places you would go on
your new wheels
so fast-forward a few years and
somewhere between your first date
traffic jams and global warming bikes
just don't feel the same anymore
this is flux electric bike we started
flux because we found one of the
ultimate joys of our childhood at times
just felt like a grind
we're on a mission to put the fun back
into cycling and more happy riders onto
cycles flux is simple just turn it on
and go in pedal assist mode flex is
exactly like riding a normal bike just
easier and faster don't want to pedal
you don't have to to push the throttle
and you'll speed through the city with
no effort at all the location of the
motor is a key factor than making this
bike so special unlike most electric
bikes in the markets
pratip a motor in the hub ours is
located in between the pedals this takes
mechanical advantage of the bike Shimano
9 speed gears meaning you can climb
Hills easier and hit top speeds quicker
couple this efficient drivetrain with an
industry crushing 17 amp hour lithium
battery and you can flux for 46 miles on
full power the battery has a key lock
for security and can be removed in a
second take it with you and recharge
wherever you want
they even features a USB port so you can
charge all of your devices on the go
behind us in advanced technology and
elegant design flux bikes at your wheels
for the modern world giving you the
power to zip past traffic explore
further and climb higher than ever
before we put these bikes through their
paces on the most challenging courses we
could find their battle tested and
designed to take a beating
stay in control with powerful hydraulic
disc brakes and sunt or suspension when
you get to the bottom you can just power
back up in record time ready to go again
and again
we've got three exciting models ready
for production we need your help to
build critical mass and bring the cost
of production down with your backing and
our expertise we're gonna bring you a
bike that will change the way you think
about riding forever to stop wasting
money on gas leave the car in the garage
come fluxed us to a more sustainable
future happy riding guys thanks for
watching
you
hey and you go go I'm Ken the creator of
Revo lights I'm here today to share with
you an idea we've been working on for
the last year the Revo lights Eclipse as
with the original this new version of
Revo lights will provide unprecedented
360-degree visibility with a functional
headlight that allows you to see where
you're going in a smart taillight that
can sense your speed and will flash when
slowing down
we're on IndieGoGo to add the next level
of function into our newest version of
the lights we want to add in the ability
to connect our already smart lights to
your phone to provide a number of
awesome features for starters real time
battery life so you can make sure your
lights are always ready for your next
ride with Eclipse the battery now snaps
directly into the ring making it much
more accessible while removing any need
for cables or parts near the hub and
making installation a snap we want our
lights to work with any riding style so
this new version will include a feature
that recognizes the time of day and
turns the lights on for you if it senses
you're about to ride to achieve the
lighting effect Revo lights calculate
your speed and for the first time we'll
be able to give you this data so you can
accurately track your speed and distance
and work towards writing goals when
developing Revo lights we focused on
creating innovative essential tools for
commuters like handlebar activated turn
signals to make it easier to grab a
driver's attention when turning we also
plan to add features for any commuter
like weather alerts letting you know
ahead of time what to expect and
ensuring you never get caught without
your jacket but with all these added
functions we wanted to make sure your
lights are secure so just like with the
previous version of our lights they are
designed to be locked up along with your
wheels so if you do have to leave your
bike on the street you don't have to
worry about removing them or having them
stolen to celebrate the launch of
Eclipse we partnered with pier fix to
bring you special edition bicycles with
Revo lights already installed
exclusively for IndieGoGo whether you're
an everyday commuter or a more casual
Rider
have you covered with the Riva Lex
Coolidge and Riva lights Arroyo bicycles
and while we're incredibly excited about
this new version we can't do it without
your feedback and support please help us
make this a reality by contributing to
our campaign thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
