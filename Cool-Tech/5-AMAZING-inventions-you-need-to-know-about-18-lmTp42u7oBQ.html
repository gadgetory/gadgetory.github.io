physical experience of music the energy
the impact that you get at a concert or
club into the real world where you can
have it everywhere and anytime you want
bass is really the part of the music
that connects you to the music
physically in a club you get that big
energy from a big sound system if you
put on the music the next day and you
just have headphones on you're just
missing that part whatever music you're
listening to it adds a physical element
to it which is something that you're
totally missing normally in a home
listening or on the good environment
people are pushing the envelope of what
they can get out of those big systems
with the way that they make that music
when we put put the based on someone's
arm and we turn on the music and soon as
the beat kicks in they have this big
smile on their face because it really
pulls you into the music you listen to
it but you can also feel it in your body
nice it's just so intense this song is
going like more and more aggressive sort
of on the base and you wouldn't think
that you know the same pace and you know
the same intensity that the base that
would be able to match it but it is it's
pretty red so i got i can feel the kick
drum which is nice and then like in the
sustained bass notes commission i think
that's really the power of it is the
ability to get that you know tactile
physical immersion that you get with
like sub bass and yet in the end it was
just fun I didn't want to take it off
you know
the baselet has very high fidelity it
matches exactly the wave form of a base
that we're trying to reproduce for us
the main challenge was no technology
existed that could do this in such a
small size so we had to create our own
and differentiate between this melodic
baseline and hard kicks so even if the
music is a melody and a kick in between
you can feel the difference the drums
you can actually kind of feel like palms
and cake and stuff I felt bit more like
those on the wrong with it inside the
baselet is amazing technology we've
built our own haptic engine which takes
up roughly half the space we've got the
other half which is battery to give a
really long play time and we've managed
to squeeze the electronics around the
battery and the haptic engine so there's
hardly any room for the electronics and
it was a tough job to get it into this
size the base layer is really designed
as an everyday companion you can hook it
up to a smartphone to a computer you can
hook it up to a laptop or VR headset you
can really use it with anything that you
would use for for listening to music for
playing games or watching movies the
basis is designed to be really easy to
use you just plug and play basically
there's no app to load there's no
software to configure ideally in the
morning you leave the house you put it
on you put on your headphones when you
come here to war when you're at work
whenever you want to listen to music out
and about I think that's when the basic
comes in this actually has a really
powerful energizing impact on you and I
think it's going to be great when you're
out about jogging or doing sports that
it really elevates you kind of activates
you and keeps you going one of the cool
things about the baselet is that it
hooks up to anything that has a
headphone output and so what I tried
right away is hooking up to a
synthesized and you play a bass line and
suddenly you have that physical impact
on base you can feel the beats of the
music you're creating and if you're DJ
you can also use the baselet to get a
sense of how the music will feel on a
big sound system in a club as well as
for music lovers I'm really making the
base it for myself I want to use it
everyday and
we're already at this stage and I'm
really really happy with that music is
certainly the most important content in
people's lives so whatever chance I have
to make that experience better I'm gonna
going to use it when I jump on it I
wouldn't take it off to be honest
three two one Wow mommy I need thee
that's crazy that's like really good
sound to the music very very clearly as
well oh my god these are just like you
can't hear it ok here we go away what's
the what's its brand called what is it
called this is sunk all listening to
music and answering phone calls are
available jungle panther yup what are
you up to nothing much just hanging on
my place right now what's up yeah I'll
be right over in a little bit cool later
bone conduction speakers transmits sound
waves to the skull via vibrations
Oh
you
I came up with the idea of
translator when I met a French girl
that's really where the story starts I
was on vacation and i met this girl it
was difficult for us to communicate
because she didn't speak English very
well and even when we tried to find a
solution like using some translation app
to communicate it's horrible look if
you're not speaking and our phones are
in a face like this forget it this is
the wall we're out of this real-world
interaction but this in your ear just
right back in it ludie put this in your
ear push me tell me oh hey yeah put in
here Kunta yeah okay can you hear me in
French p for me i'll call the whole
thing is visible days he'll say yes I
can hear you talk spanish and causes
this but this is awesome but how you do
it yeah it's translating translating
this little wearable uses translation
technology to allow two people to speak
different languages but still clearly
understand each other simply put when
one person speaks the other here is it
in their language developing the pilot
has been an intensive process our team's
been working on it for over two years
andrew is original co-founder and
overseas prior development I'm an
electrical engineer and expert and
manufacturing we also have mechanical
engineer software engineer PhD and
machine translation as well as an
industrial designer our wide breadth of
experts has allowed us to develop a
product from the ground up we wanted to
create something that hugs the curves of
the year without being obtrusive
something snug but fashionable to wear
in the process we just decided to throw
in an extra earpiece for wireless
streaming music that means the full
system includes two earpieces and its
accompanying app it's from the app
itself where all of the languages are
uploaded to the earpiece it's kind of an
end-all solution for the traveler or the
international professional that's what
we're doing here at Waverly louse it's
simply the most advanced communication
wearable
they say IndieGoGo campaign helps us
finish what we started we can get the
ear pieces along with this portable
charger manufactured and delivered
within a year the app works on its own
if you just want to use the app or basic
translation and we'll have the app out
by late summer first for our backers
here on IndieGoGo but for the full
experience you really want the ear
pieces too it's the dream you know a
life untethered free of language
barriers it's just that it's no longer
dream anymore it's real
you
control the revolution in Iowa their
first is always the winner the second is
the first loser after launching the
first control our products the control
one we receive so many requests from the
crowdfunding community for a new design
with a full frame and a new color and
there it is the cultural cross country
amongst the 10 best in the world in
extreme mountain biking called the
marathon mountain bike
the disability plays a big role in every
sport and specially mountain biking
there's a new I work and really make the
difference I mainly riding rough terrain
and it's really important to have your
eyes on the road if you go fast downhill
and you don't see you have to break
fast and you can't really do anything
with the normal I wear so I'm really
enthusiastic about this product using
the automatic mode makes me really feel
like I'm more in control I really feel
safe that going downhill with it with
high speed and entering thornless
forests or any danger coming up control
I wear uses the fastest responding and
most energy efficient technology
available the disruptive and patented
electronic tint on demand technology was
designed for the US Special Forces it
offers instantaneous adapting tin within
point 1 seconds control your tint
manually with a simple touch of a button
or put it on the automatic mode to
change automatically depending on the
surrounding light the rechargeable
battery lasts for about 70 hours
with control I where you control your
vision now available for any athlete or
outdoor adventurist who wants to enhance
their athletic performance you can be
part of this I wear revolution by
ordering the control XC now
this used to be me starting another day
with the same for wireless connection we
all experience for Wi-Fi day and night
and never found a good solution this has
been my problem for the last 10 years in
probably yours too hi I'm David I want
to introduce you to this rule the world
first known electric cooperative armed
with sous Pro you can easily double and
even triple your Wi-Fi range and also
maximize your Wi-Fi quality just by
mounting it on your router antenna sous
pro focuses the Wi-Fi frequency to 180
degrees instead of 360 degrees most
Wi-Fi routers nowadays have two or even
more antennas so when installing Zeus
pro you still can get 360 degrees Wi-Fi
connection but now with three times the
range and that's not all
it could be your old neighbor surfing on
your Wi-Fi but it can be an unwanted
guest Wi-Fi is highly easily hackable by
turning Zeus pro and aim it to your
private area you can secure your
wireless network from unwanted guests
Zeus Pro also increases your Wi-Fi
connection speed by reducing
interferences that block the Wi-Fi
signal and for the gamers between us it
reduces lags and disconnections
