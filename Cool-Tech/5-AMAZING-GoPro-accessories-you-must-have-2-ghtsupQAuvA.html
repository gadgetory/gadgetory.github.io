in movement while moving over to rain

your GoPro on slick and you're ready to
ride with slick getting smooth footage

times so you can have more fun with your
camera and focus less on the battery

charger for GoPro works with all
batteries made for Hero 3 and here for
I love using my GoPro but I dread being
distracted from the adventure that I'm

level or to wrestle with the housing to
potentially expose the lens to damage or
getting it dirty

this is Sabri Lowe the smartest GoPro
accessory ever made are you ready for
the steady future
badenov gopro cameras have
revolutionized how we see the world with
the nice wide angle lens in the building
to mount anywhere we can capture the
point of view from truly epic moments or
simply glimpse a radical new perspective
on something familiar the problem is
that they just don't work well in
low-light conditions and any footage at
night underwater or even in shadows
comes out poorly exposed that's why we
want to build a light that can go
wherever your action camera does and
provide the extra light it needs to
capture amazing imagery introducing the
sidekick sidekick is the perfect
companion light for your GoPro it
provides the light the hero sensor needs
in any condition including deep
underwater the Plus model has two beams
a wide 600 lumen flood which is perfect
for capturing the action and a narrow
for Hubble image spot which is great for
navigation the two button control is
simple and intuitive to use
and speaking of simple and intuitive we
design the light to be factory sealed no
messing with batteries or doors just
slip on the external charger plug into
USB and full charge can be accomplished
in just over four hours great lights not
enough it has to mount securely with
your GoPro which is why we designed a
very simple mount you place the standard
nut with the extender nut mount your
GoPro as always use our longer finger
screw add friction washer and screw
directly into your sidekick tighten
adjust and turn on your ready to go it's
secure on helmets bike bars or grips
additional mounting options include a
lock line system which allows you to
mount the light directly over the camera
the body has been machined from a single
piece of aluminum the two button and
single button designs are complete
currently the rear cover is machined
from Del Rey with your help it will be
injection molded circuit board is well
tested the custom spot and flawed optics
are also molded the circuit board mounts
to a thermal plate which transfers the
heat away from the LEDs and into the
main body rear light motion a small
company that has manufactured high
powered lighting solutions for outdoor
enthusiasts for over 20 years
we're really proud to keep the whole
engineering manufacturing and assembly
under one roof and to do it all
domestically in Marina California your
support means a great deal to us with
your help we can launch sidekick this
spring the prototypes are being tested
and refined and we're preparing to run
the first 2000 as a special edition run
hand machine here in our factory
offering you these models at a special
price and your investment in those
models will give us the funding we need
