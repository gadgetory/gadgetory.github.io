bonds to almost any other materials
overnight it turns into a strong durable
rubber one of our customers describes it
best relate bed super jump and play doh
had a love child than this would be it
it's Octonauts mold into any shape yes
durable enough to fix almost anything I
invented to make fixing and making easy
for everyone over the last few
generations we've grown out of the habit
of fixing stuff and I've aspire too much
waste in this world what if we could
have a more thoughtful relationship with
the stuff we own and their environment
so buy new things all the time why don't
we fixed improve and reimagine that we
already have so it works better through
I grew up on a farm and on a fire fixing
is a way of life when something breaks
you don't go to the shop you get the
welder
I fell out everyone left like this when
I realized he didn't I wanted to do
something a bit I decided to go to
school in London to become a product
designer I was so excited about it but a
few weeks in it wasn't what I'd imagined
designing more new things for the world
just didn't seem like the right thing to
do I felt totally lost one day I did a
random experiment between silicon
polymers with sawdust that led to dick
look like wood but it's been like a
ping-pong ball back to me was magic I
really want the financials of curious
thing could be but I just couldn't
figure out what it was for until one
night my boyfriend James said I said
follow me to the kitchen look for what
is doing you've been using your leftover
materials in 26 what was normal for
everyone 26 and redesign of stuff like
this I was like wow that's an amazing
idea that's when my mind went wild I
started to imagine the countless things
that people could do with it I could
make this work it could be so useful for
millions of people so I teamed up with
some amazing scientists who helped me
get started I had a lot to learn and I
needed to get hands-on again this time
in a lab we had to learn about silicone
polymer chains designing a cross linking
process that could be catalyzed simply
by exposure to air and how to make
something that could be a pleasure to
move in your hands it bombed like crazy
almost any other surface and then we
have cigarettes how it would be in dust
really robust
taxes scale thousands of experiments and
engineering hours later he has made the
world versatile salute this material is
absolutely amazing because of what new
do women really is the world's most
first counseling services that allows
you to see anything to anything you can
mold in his any shape fill those weird
gaps between things creating a strong
secure bond nuts at all got some pretty
cool property to its strong but flexible
cold and heat resistant sticky yet
removable waterproof and UV resistance
good for indoors and a grippy and even
shock absorbing just stick it shape it
and in 24 hours turns into the strong
flexible rubber and can make your cables
last longer you can make handy hooks to
hang anything anymore fix broken plastic
leaving fix my favorite drink smoke it
helps keep your feet warm and dry it's
waterproof he's in cold resistance so
you can easily take the broken field and
complexion shoes sugar is super durable
too perfect for use indoors and as
people log servers because fixing things
just makes sense and feels great the
customizing the PlayStation controller
for like Stefan who transformed an old
digital camera into the kick-ass kiss
cam or like knowing who has given a new
foot made with suguri these ideas come
from people all over the world who are
using Subaru to make their stuff last
longer works better for them it grown
into a community you're just people who
love to share their ideas and stories to
help inspire the world to get fixing
again sugru the world's most versatile
glue come on over to see recom join in
and get excited imagine transforming
your smartphone into a professional
microscope and exploring the fascinating
microcosm that is all around you
see the life within a droplet of natural
water investigate a biological sample on
a microscope slide or simply find out
what hides on your fingernails smoothly
and flawlessly integrated with the
capabilities of a smartphone mu peek
will expand your imagination beyond your
own boundaries
hello my name is Patrick Gallagher and
i'm the co-founder and CEO of Corona and
one of the inventors of new peak when
developing new fix our idea was not just
to create another magnifying lens for
your smartphone the idea was to design a
solution that will combines antique
equality with a seamless found a sign
that you will be proud to carry around
MP feed with not much larger than a
credit card new pic will easily fit into
your pocket miniature design does not
mean miniature functionality new peak
has capabilities that even costly
laboratory microscope generally lack
using innovative optical illumination
architecture noopie combines advantages
of several as well contrasting technique
when using standard microscope slides we
move the microscope slide holder from
the adhesive back of new peak attach the
device to your phone insert the
microscope slides into the holder and
start working it's so simple and
powerful so don't be surprised if it
becomes a professional first choice
new peak makes a great tool to teach
advanced microscopy at high schools and
universities where cost is naturally a
concern nucleic not only helps to say
finances but also saves valuable shelf
space and thanks to MU peaks excellent
portability project works are no longer
restricted to indoor location users can
work directly in the field easily record
and share the pictures why their
smartphones and above all have fun
learning because music is so sleek it
may continue to be attached to your
smartphone and go into your pocket
almost unnoticed however once on wheels
it will certainly catch the attention of
your friends give them a hands-on
illustration of new peak and sent them
the microscopic pictures taken by your
favorite social networks with our spin
up company's grown up we are in the
ongoing development of a 3d printer with
nano scale resolution while being
designed to showcase the result of our
prototype printer you peak generated
such overwhelming performance and
utility feedback that we decided to make
it even better and just form it into a
standalone product so why buy a new peak
you not only by a great product you also
support the further development of our
early stage printing technology into the
next game changing platform of 3d
printing
you
we've all seen those crazy christmas
place people's homes exploding with
colors and dancing to music what if you
could do the same in your home with just
one light what if that one life could
bring music to life change an entire
room Jamie move work as a clock or even
a messaging Center what is it should do
more things than any light you've ever
imagined that life is the tittle an
interactive LED lamps that can
completely transform your home's
lighting and it's pretty amazing you may
know that when you add a dot to an eye
you're adding a Siddle but when you add
a fiddle to your house it's more than a
doc it's 512 dots of dancing vibrant LED
lights lights that can show 3d animation
life that you can control through a
mobile app will regularly add new
beautiful 3d animations and
functionalities it'll can change and
grow as you own it right now it'll has
quite a few features that can make any
occasion more amazing you can use it as
a bedside lamp where you can easily

to set the mood for your living room
choosing between a fireplace snowfall
fireworks and radiant colors and bring
the party to life with the music
visualizer it'll will move and pulse and
change with whatever you're playing with
fun 3d animation yeah it'll have
something for every month but like we
said before tittle is more than a like
you can also interact with anyone else
who has a tittle and send them 3d emojis
that could mean a heart
or a smiley face or anything to brighten
up their day want to get creative little
go for it through the app you can create
your own animation color settings and
features the possibilities are endless
it has been an amazing journey develop
inches we can't do it all in all the
small stuff company that is when we get
around to a few years we invent unique
niche electronics that are fun practical
and stylish you know what it takes to
make a beautiful product and it starts
with assembling the best team possible
from our software and engineering teams
to our manufacturing facilities we put
together an amazing group of
collaborators and partners now this is
where you come in we're so close to
bringing total to life but we need your
support to help complete production so
we can share fiddle with the world thank
you thank you
