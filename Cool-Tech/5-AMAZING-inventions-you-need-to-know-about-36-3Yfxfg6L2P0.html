Oh
traveling is a blast what's not fun is
filling our bags with underwear or worst
of all running out of a fresh pair just
when you need it that's why we created
silver air a revolutionary new underwear
that doesn't smell so you can pack
lighter and stay fresh longer our secret
is pure silver the same silver that's
used in hospitals and even in spacesuits
for its antimicrobial properties it
prevents the growth of odor and keeps
your gear fresh over long periods of
time so go ahead grab some pears put
them in your bag and you'll be set for
the week to create the most comfortable
fabric we use to 17.5 micron premium
merino wool which feels softer than your
most comfortable cotton underwear while
delivering better performance than
anything you've ever worn it even
regulate temperature no matter where you
go your jeweled evokes a cool dry and in
between be comfortable best of all the
silver is permanently bonded into the
fabric and last the life of the product
finally there's this something all guys
can relate to so we created markridge
which uses soft silicone beads to
provide just the right amount of hold so
your underwear doesn't write up and
instead of being these guys you can be
bad guy from the smart design to the
beautiful processor we've thought about
every single detail and cluster in the
process of creating the ultimate travel
underwear he just made the best damn
underwear for daily wear boom this is
droplet a simple button you can attach
to anything designed to make your life
easier droplet is a better way to
remember things and let you track the
activities that are important to you

source communities have undeniably
revolutionized the digital world but now
it's time to take things one step
further we're applying that same
methodology personal transportation and
by standardizing the basic hardware and
software we've made it easy for anyone
to design share and spell their own
personal short distance vehicle we call
it flex TV
we want you to make a vehicle so we can
go to have lunch le diner which is not
to follow it but no nearby neither so as
the guys what's the best in your mind by
save all whooping cough what are the
skaters well then I thought about what
so common part they have how about we
make an electric motor for anything you
strap it on and then you get your right
flex TV contains three reversal modules
the motor battery and controller install
in flux EV is as easy as staying with
Lego just fascinate to any object with
universal bracket you can convert the
normal student into electric one in less
than 10 minutes to convert a bike or
skateboard is even faster what you need
to do is just a tightening skis and
connecting table once you are done you
can control frak TV with the mobile app
and the remote control is coming soon
when the Sun staff was my own with my
own style I think I'll find a special
way to express myself sometimes it's
that to me the truth in front of the
wheels I feel a connection with the
objects damnation it's like Leonard
after making a vehicle we are building
our passion when Spanish is on a road
and then 1 i'm actually is I feel wow
this is so amazing
there are so many other people just like
music it's good together a community of
the same interest having the same
desires I'm so obsessed with the process
I feel I've found the place of delight
damn
