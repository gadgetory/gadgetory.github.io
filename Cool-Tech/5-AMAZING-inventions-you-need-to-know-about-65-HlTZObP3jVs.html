allows to measure both straight line and
curves by simply rolling for point to
point measure any line any curve made
out of stainless steel that is designed
in four versions for measuring and
centimeters or inches the row before
inch and the Roby turn convenors are
teaching size rulers that come with
genuine leather pouches in black or
brown this is the most compact group
it's no larger than a coin it always
fits in your pocket no matter where you
go the larger version such as the Roby 8
inch and 20 centimeters still aren't
very portable and would be handy at any
time now we need to measure things all
the time with the Roby you can measure
any object with a square or round along
any line or curve measuring it simply
place the ruler on any surface or line
roll and count full rotation then add
remaining units and you don't have your
measure
drafting layouts and templates measuring
curves and specific design details is
highly necessary for professionals like
tailors architects designers carpenters
and many others the Robie allows you to
do it in a convenient way designed for
everyone whether you're a professional
or just find this idea of a compact
ruler as awesome as we do the rope
