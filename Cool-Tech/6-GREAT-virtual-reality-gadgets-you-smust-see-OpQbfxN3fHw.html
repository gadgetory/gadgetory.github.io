mound you can see what i can see let's
take it up in a helicopter you can also
do live broadcasting like periscope
there's a goat in the tree but in 360
degrees 90-minute record time that's
longer than any other consumer
360-degree camera let's go there be
about skydiving
you can also share directly to all the
social media apps well that here is
called a tortoise softball you look good
you can also do 360 degree time lapse
and I'm using the app to adjust it do

Ronald
so that was the 4k live streaming 360
panorama video camera from camera Rama
we had a really really good couple days
running around Hawaii shooting with it
got a lot of good 360 video 360 photos
made a lot of cool friends and this 360
video this is the future you know it's
fun to be part of it so if you're
interested in this technology jump on
board it is it is literally the future
of video and I want to thank camera Rama
appreciate the camera and aloha from
hawaii
you
we arm is all about content the rest is
technology when we talk about we our
content the first thing you need is a
good without camera we talked to win our
studios and content creators all of them
are looking for a better we our camera
so we decided to make a better one our
team is very experienced in camera
program and we have successfully
launched Z can be one last Nina now and
very proud to present we can as one
which I believe is the best of its kind
seeing seeing is believing seeing is
believing
based on ze mu1 camera system as one is
built with a fully integrate for image
sensor system all four sensors are
precisely synchronized to ensure
simultaneous recording each lens is
closely mount with each other resulting
in shorter safety distance between the
camera and the object
we have chosen a super high resolution
hundred ninety degree fish eye lens
which provides excellent image quality
and outperforms those sports camera
resolutions a full metal housing is used
to improve heat dissipation resulting in
much longer continuous recording there
are two power options an AC DC power
adapter socket and a detachable bachelor
unit using 18 650 standard lithium-ion
rechargeable battery cells image files
are stored on SD cards in addition to
the four individual HDMI ports there is
a Gigabit Ethernet port which allows not
only easy and fast image file transfer
but also live real possibility through
external solutions and since we provide
full set open a PR expert users we found
this extremely useful because they can
remotely control as one through the
ethernet port
we think professional we are cameras
should be more sophisticated than
traditional cameras we have developed a
special algorithm to coordinate auto
white balance and auto exposure of all
four sensors resulting in more
harmonized images
our team is very experienced in image
quality turning and optimization we have
continued to improve the overall image
quality will answer asleep we've simply
one objective in mind to be the best
you
you
you
you
