first digital 3d microphone that plugs
right into your iPhone as a musician
it's important I can have high quality
audio at a moment's notice
like when we need to record a demo the
second inspiration strikes yeah actually
and I barely have to think about it
because lolly doesn't need a separate
app battery or memory card it's as
simple as plugging into your iPhone and
recording lolly can also be a great
addition to a filmmakers kit it'll
instantly give you industry standard
44.1 for 48 kilohertz audio lolly is
designed to be three feet so no matter
how you turn your smartphone hit adjust
the orientation so that when you listen
to it back it creates an immersive
feeling like they're really bad and with
the reversibility of the Lightning port
lolly can easily be used with either
camera
we understand that you guys are debuting
a new song tonight can you tell us a
little bit and for the podcaster a radio
journalist lolis portability means you
can always be ready to record
professional interviews
and when you're going to concerts lolly
is a great way to document the
excitement getting crisp sound even when
your front row record of lolly because
great sound matters
as an apprentice carpenter I was always
searching for the best way to complete
every task one thing in particular with
material print I thought there were far
too many tools needed to complete such a
simple job I wanted one tool that could
do it all but it didn't exist so I
decided to invent one it's called the
Rufus offering over three hundred and
fifty percent more functionality than
any other line tool it took me seven
years but I finally figured it out it
also has applications in other fields
such as steel fabrication and roof
plumbing was a little girl um but she
goes for the game your flair
for the game you're playing bingo
but she could
your bear
the game
Okwe of that mountain
then the boaters start to drop and I can
see her all this Molly
as I'm falling she don't stop she don't
stop no I want to
she goes or the gate
are you gay
i watch you work
she go to the game your
in your blue
again cannot breathe
wasted on
just tryna get close to you
she
