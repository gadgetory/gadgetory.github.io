okay
Hey
lock your phone again not afraid I'm not
afraid I am on on the rock I'm not ready
to be a fool like not everything
Hey yeo-hwa hey I found your lost dog by
the sweet there you are
hi I'm Ken and I'm Davey we're the
creators of Flash's thanks for making
our product a viral hit it seems like
you've spread it all over the internet
and you really really want it flashes
started off at the Halloween project and
when I thought Davey worked with a tiny
little LED and I thought how can I make
them into something fun so I hacked
Davey can we make them into eyelashes
and I said we should try it so we did it
and the first iteration was just simple
on and off the second iteration we
thought why not make it a little bit
more fun so what if it's more
interactivity so we had a motion
controller and then your LEDs
individually addressable and so you've
seen some of the patterns but you we
have let's look at some of the
interaction you can fill your head like
this you can bow or down or you can just
simply turn your head with the fun
project and we're hoping that you guys
really really want it and like it so
please support a Kickstarter thank you
thank you
you
this is a bag in it there's the ultimate
touring kayak you might think to
yourself wow that's a small bag you
probably mean the ultimate folding kayak

and it's not just because it's a real
touring tire one that allows you to go
on four towns and longer multi-day tours
but also tour the world
it's the ultimate touring kayak because
the best swing kayak on water - yup
we're confident how do you go about
creating the ultimate touring kayaks
well you talk to paddle and ask them
what would make it the best luckily for
us with over 10 years of experience in
building kayaks we also have quite a few
customers that here are the results of
the survey we gave thousands of paddlers
91.5% said that the quality of material
is the most important aspect over 90
percent demanded durability then there
was comfort performance keys of
transport versatility and pretty
don't worry one guy we made it pretty
pretty awesome our inspiration for the
track 2.0 was the original Inuit kaya
only and we say this with the utmost
respect ours is greatly enhanced by
modern technology our skin is military
grade material engineered over a carbon
fiber and aircraft aluminum frame the
result is a kayak that can fit in this
bag while being more durable and impact
resistant than the hardshell kayak it's
super tough out of tough enough to last
10 years in any condition did we punch
it enough
let's punch it again
so there you have it quality and
durability
check our surveying paddlers also really
cared about performance that's what
makes a great touring tire well the
track not only performs incredibly well
it is also the only kayak that can
change the shape to accommodate
condition and alter the water line
making it paddle like a shorter or
maneuverable kayak or a longer faster
touring tire that makes for many packs
in one ever setup it only takes ten
minutes really and as for ease of
transport you already saw the bag it
goes into and you already agreed it's
small enough to fit in any car and light
enough to carry on training and yes you
can take it on a plane we have now for
the extra thinking took on the track is
customizable and super comfortable its
deck out fitting in deck storage bags
are modular yes it's all around pretty
odd to make all this a reality we've
been working with an amazing team of
engineers from some of Canada and the
world's best organizations so yes this
is a small bag and it holds incited the
world's most incredible touring tire one

back take anywhere in the world and
