you
I've always loved writing the feeling of
being one with the road until your
headphones ball
I could deal with this all the time I'd
be riding earbuds on in the zone and
then all of a sudden it was like
somebody turned up the wind noise to 11
when emin told me about this I knew
exactly what he was going through there
were so many times when my earbuds would
fall out I'd miss a call while riding
but I couldn't hear anything was on
highway I knew there had to be a better
product out there for writers so we look
and look and look nothing we immediately
decided to solve this problem once and
for all we wanted to create the best set
of earbuds for riders what we came up
with is one of the most unique designs
this space has ever seen introducing
slim boats slim bots are earbuds
designed with the writer in mind sitting
flush with the ear you'll never have to
worry about your helmet interfering with
your listening experience ever again and
with strategic microphone placement your
calls will always be crystal clear
without having to worry about Windows
we've built slim bought with passive
noise isolation technology allowing for
the most immersive audio experience
you've ever had while writing at you
safety is very important to us as good
as our slim but sound we are equally
focused on keeping you safe while riding
inside the chin like there's a secondary
microphone dedicated to picking up and
relaying environmental noise this means
that you'll hear horns sirens and
anything else you need to hear while
riding if riding in the pack is more
your speed we know how important
communication can be use the EOS app to
at your friends to your chat now you can
talk to them with just the push of a
button using the slim remote our
wireless time to bar controller the
flume remote connects via bluetooth and
allows you to control your audio make
phone calls and activate voice commands
all while riding
are you ready for the best audio
experience you've ever had while writing
pledge today and help us bring slim bus
to the market thank you
hello and thank you for taking the time
to view our campaign video I'm Jason
thought director of em to see innovation
with inventors of the hugely successful
content brands but has taken the camping
world by storm over the last few years
pod changed the face of camping why
allow intent to be connected together

pitch modular camping versions close

less than two minutes straight out a bag
and fully pitch unlike other quick
pitching tents in fact like many other
tents in the camping world you can stand
up in all of our variations are the two
men right through to the former the cube
isn't easy to pack away as it is to set
up and it means you won't need to be an
expert in origami to try and get it back
into the bag when you're ready to come
home one of the major issues with
standard sense has been woken up by the
Sun so with the cube tent we've added a
black lining to our material and this
blocks out the sunlight our extensive
ventilation system means that a cool
environment inside our tents the
material is the you coated and rated to
our hydrostatic head ratings of 4,000
meaning you'll be nice and dry even
under heavy rain conditions a heavy-duty
300d nylon material means this tent is
built to last for many years to come the
key to the cube is that they're easy to
read and they offer you a great space
inside in addition we have a few extras
that we think will make this 10 in a
class of its own

together the universal time system means

interconnect depend on every cube you
