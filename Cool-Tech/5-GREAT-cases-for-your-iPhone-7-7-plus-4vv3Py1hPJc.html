No
our loon case users loved its power of
illumination but they've been asking us
for more designs and colors we started
creating looking for ideas in everything
seeking advice from our clients and
partners the light gave us unlimited
possibilities and we did not want to
stop creating something unusual
something exciting and sometimes
surprising we have the best feature ever
the light and this is what makes Spectre
unique developing illumination
technology that shines bright and it
lasts for ages was at the core of our
mission Spectre is clearer and more
vibrant than what came before we
utilized a brand new polycarbonate
materials blend that gives more
transparency and rigidness to the case
we increased the duration illumination
takes place added animation and
broadened our lighting palette our first
generation product changed the iPhone
case industry but it was just a first
step on our journey we developed a solid
production base and production is what
we've been up to for some time now
think sketch discuss build test and do
it all over again
lots of late nights and pots of coffee
unlike our first project a Spectre is
almost ready the only thing we're
missing now is your support join us and
help us create the future of wearable
devices loon case was just the first
step let's make history and do it again
we wanted to design something beautiful
of course but we also wanted something
useful we understand that some people
love their music to them it's very
important more important than taking
their medication often
but what pairs well with music oh that's
right
headphones yes what people decide to put
into their own ear holes is a very
personal choice and it's a choice we
should all get the chance to make not
one that should be made for us that's
why we made fuse it's a case made
specifically for the iPhone 7 and 7 plus
but it's not just a case it's also the
first case with a 3.5 millimeter audio
jack 2 lighting adapter built-in it's
time to rock out with your arcs app
that's right
with fuse you can use your favorite
earbuds or headset that you already have
with the iPhone 7 adapters on rock and
roll
rubbish having to wear the same earbuds
as everybody else isn't rock'n'roll
Airport hot bloody rock and roll you
know what is being able to do whatever
the hell you want with your ear fuse is
an iPhone case something Apple CEO Tim
Cook says every iPhone 7 user should use
but it's so much more than that
Apple is trying to kill the headphone
jack and that's something that affects
all of us there are dozens of uses for
the port beyond music there are credit
card readers thermometers microphones
adult toys and even blood monitors some
people even use it to make sure they
don't die you don't want this grandma to
die do you of course you don't
and neither do we now all we can't say
that Apple remove the audio jack because
it wants to kill people obviously we
can't say in this very real specific
scenario the fuse is a device that can
quite literally save lives and unlike
the Galaxy Note 7 it won't explode
burning you and your family alive
