video and photography whether you're a
first-time pilot for a long time pro
solo is the most powerful and easiest to
use drone on the market solo is designed
from the ground up to give you the best
overall aerial experience imaginable
solo pair smooth flying characteristics
with powerful features making it easy
for you to get great professional shots
from day one cable camp allows you to
lock solo on a virtual cable between any
two points in the air so you can focus
on camera work pan and tilt the camera
freely without needing to keep track of
the direction of the copter solo can
even memorize your framing at each end
of the cable then smoothly shift your
camera between the two points easing
into and out of the move like a seasoned
professional these features are made
possible by solos two onboard computers
which enabled radical breakthroughs in
both flight and camera control this
makes solo the world's first smart
by harnessing the power of these
computers even brand new pilots have the
ability to capture beautiful cinematic
shots that would otherwise require years
of practice the included mobile app
gives you a beautiful live view from
your GoPro easy access to solos
exclusive shot mode and even helps you
learn how to fly with a built-in flight
trainer we've worked closely with GoPro
to make solo the world's first drone to
give you full control of your GoPro
through both our mobile app as well as
dedicated button on solos controller
this controller was designed from the
ground up to give you an unrivaled
aerial photography experience it's
gaming controller inspired economics
will feel familiar even two brand new
pilots it also has its own built-in
computer putting control of both the
vehicle and the camera at your
fingertips all of these features are
seamlessly integrated into a simple
all-in-one system giving you the power
to easily capture amazing aerial
photography solo the smart drone
you
at its launch the inspire one was a
revolution it turned tens of thousands
of people into aerial filmmakers and now
appears on professional film sets around
the world the inspire tube builds on the
foundation empowering filmmaker to be
more creative than heavy weather flying
as a team or operating as a single pilot
a dedicated to access stabilized STV
camera with independently adjustable
fitch gives the piloting personal live
beat bring the camera off smooth anyway
they need you to get the shot top speeds
is boosted to 58 miles per hour 94 km/h
and ascent and beechnut hits also
accelerated the speeds doesn't come
without protection DJ is unmatched white
economy system comes to conspire to
bringing with it an extended-range close
to 100 feet in faster flight with
protection from what it can see it also
adds an infrared sensor placed on top
lane wires extending obstacle avoidance
to obstructions overhead
the new dual battery designs increases
flight light hitting a maximum of twenty
seven minutes when using the x 4's
camera and also provides battery
redundancy self heating systems mean
inspire to can be flown in extreme cold
the zenmuse x5s micro four thirds camera
now has a 20 point eight megapixel
sensor with better pixel perfect it is
capable of capturing 5.2 k at 30 frames
per second as well as 4k at 60 frames
per second it also supports cinema BMG
and pro res recording you just kind of
look at you know like that's really
small the how can this little small
thing give these big results we normally
wouldn't think of it using a drone for a
normal shot but kind of made us really
simple shot easily now and look great
and I'm really I'm just I'm tell you I'm
really taking the inspire to is DJ focus
compatible for precision focus control a
broad range of micro four thirds lenses
are also supported including zoom from
nine millimeter 245 245 is mine is
beautiful on this camera we use done lot
for close-ups and has a great depth of
field and just make me feel like you
know that's Kozma nematic permitted the
inspire to image processor no Nets in a
court to point o offers cinema dng
prores h.264 and h.265 recording onto a
detachable PCIe SSD drives with a
maximum read and write speed of sixty
two bits per second or a micro SD card
Perez is a widely used delivery method
for post-production offering flexibility
for editing while not compromising image
quality but to get the absolute most out
of what you should be inspired to offer
captures wrong acquiring content on raw
just gives you more information to work
with in your post process the raw native
cinema dmg for map gives you the most
dynamic range possible of that camera
basically takes full advantage of the
center and everything that it can see
there is a one-shot that we compromised
for details for color purity for
separation and just
black for low-light detail highlight
detail well I never could have told you
that this particular footage came from
the drum it's just too good new
intelligent modes including spotlight
Pro and profile make cinematic shots
easier for production teams and even for
single operators spotlight probe keeps
the camera lost on the subject rotating
beyond 360 degrees fix the target in
frame as inspire flies while profile
mode turns a camera to capture the
subjects profile as the inspire flies
forward by maintaining Ford's life
optical sensing systems are able to
protect the aircraft the onboard fpv
camera separates the flight view from
the main camera view effectively giving
you aspire to a dedicated tap
sledgehammer just tap on the screen to
fly in that direction and focus on
camera control during return to home the
primary camera with a maximum sensing
range 200 meters is used to effectively
avoid obstructions live TV broadcasting
has also been enabled natively through
an optimized broadcast mode that strings
smooth video at the 1080i 50 and 720p 60
s live broadcast standards the inspire
to bring better quality images more
power and more intelligence professional
aerial filmmaking setting the stage for
more filmmakers to take the decide
I'm Mike Holden I've been a real estate
agent for ten years five years ago to
impress the client who hired a
professional photographer today aerial
photography is the new thing the drone
helps me stand out from the competitors
gives a WOW factor a different angle
that you can't get on the ground I got
the Otel robotics drone when I saw the
expense for the aerial photography so it
was an extra two hundred fifty dollars
for a drone photography session for a
new listing of mine I started doing the
math on that and figured if I could
cover that in a few sessions buying my
own I'd go that route so I'll tell
robotics drone was a reasonable price
picked it up and just went right into it
it was easy there's a start/stop button
there's a land button the take-off
button a home button if you get lost
just very simple I mean I barely know
how to use the iPhone but I picked up
the drone and it was just using so I've
taken some interior video as well I'll
film the outsides and I also will come
through the front door but not flying
I'll just carry it in as such a nice
camera and it's got the stabilizer on it
so when I come through it looks like
you're just floating through the house
like a professional filmer would I know
people say they can use their phone and
film stuff but you can tell it's just
not nearly the quality that the
autoerotic strung with you when you show
up with a drone to a listing it really
wow them they're like geez I wasn't I
wasn't expecting this but I trees going
to take pictures negative helicopters
flying around my house and I'm getting
every angle and showing the backyard in
the patio and how the whole layout of
the property works fly around the
neighborhood check out the park see what
the kids walk home from schools like
it's a really a big selling point I tell
robotics is helping me improve my
business grow my business and set me
apart from the comp
it may sound crazy but you can do this
to all of it it's easy how do we know
because we've made it eat at DJ I we
created the flying camera as you know it
fans there's a good chance that the
drone videos you've seen online were
shot with one of our cameras this time
we started small so you can dream big we
created your first personal throne but
we're still squeezing in big power it
automatically follows you or whatever
you want without a bracelet or trackers
avoid obstacles and come packed with a
fork a stabilized camera 27 minutes
flight time and a whole lot more this is
the DJI Matic Pro and this is the DJI
mavic pro unfolding to make it this
small we have to rip out a ton of cool
stuff right now it's got 24 high
performance computing cores dual
satellite connectivity and all new
transmission systems with a 4.3 mile
range for vision sensors and more sound
complicated it's not it's easy the mavic
knows where it takes off from where it
is in the air where it's going and what
is capturing when you take off the mavic
users to vision sensors and connects
with up to 20 satellites also it can
remember your location this means the
mavic knows where home is so it can
return by itself precision landing
technology means it can land almost
exactly where you took off at the touch
of a button
as you fly satellite systems keep track
of you working in harmony with all four
vision sensors telling it what's below
and what's in front whether you are
flying beside a cliff in a forest or
even indoors just like you Maddox T and
thinks that means it can avoid the
things in its path from trees to wall
any good flying camera need
stabilization the maddox expertly
miniaturized gimbal teach the entire
camera steady unlike electronic
stabilization you use every pixel from
the tensor and you don't have the weight
of a bulky add on camera shooting an
epic tracking shot of a friend is easy
active track technology means it just
takes a few tests not just one kind of
tracking shot either it got spotlight
profile and trait or you tap lai adapt
and flock
terrain follow mode keeps the mavic at a
height you define as the ground right so
you can focus on your shot not your hike
everything can be controlled using a
gamepad size controller you can keep in
your pocket it opens up to clamp around
your phone and has been custom
engineered to give you more feedback and
more accuracy you will always feel in
control if you don't want to bother with
the controller fly eating virtual
joystick right from your phone over
Wi-Fi whether you fly with the remote
controller or just your phone active
track modes are ready to make you shoot
like a pro want to be on camera not
behind it it just takes a wave and a
gesture then there's the new DJ I goggle
strap these on to really feel like
you're flying combine them with sport
mode to get your pulse-pumping while you
fly at an incredible 40 miles per hour
once you've got your shot edit
everything together then djigo and share
or even stream your flight live to
Facebook or YouTube inspiration can
strike from the smallest thing a sketch
a feeling and experience the mavic has
been designed for you to take it
anywhere ready at a moment's notice
whenever inspiration strikes you to
create something truly great
DJ I'm attic wherever you go
