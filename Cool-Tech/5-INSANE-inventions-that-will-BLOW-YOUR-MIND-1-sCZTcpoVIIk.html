you
for the last year we set out to create
an electric skateboard with an authentic
long boarding experience I'm pleased to
introduce the juice cord from the shape
and flex of the deck an oversized 82
millimeter wheeled the juice board
offers a buttery smooth ride while
taking on pebbles and cracks as if they
weren't even there we've designed the
juice towards music for beginners to
learn and powerful enough for the
seasoned rider with the remote in your
hand you can access four unique speed
modes with each mode the top speed
acceleration and braking power are
adjusted allowing you to start off easy
an adapter board as you're riding
progressed doing away with the
traditional belt drive system we've
sealed our motor right inside to be
making a highly dust and water resistant
this also means there are no bulbs to
replace and if your element battery you
can pre real just like a regular
longboard
the juice board is now in production
we'll be shipping early summer stoked
about this project by June come along
for the ride and bring a do sports
industry

you
I really want people to understand how
profound this is okay this is not just
another device that is going to count
something for you
this is life-changing and it's already
been life-changing for thousands of
people my patients needed solutions
outside of the office to reduce their
stress response and what it came down to
within people's nervous systems or in
fight-or-flight nobody's at their best
fight-or-flight killed all of our
rational thinking it inflames our body
it creates 90% of chronic health
problems and I think we need a solution
that's simple effective and that anybody
can use so that everybody can be their
best touchpoints our neuroscience we're
both that decreased stress level and as
little as 30 seconds the device is used
gentle vibration on either side of the
body to help you calm down focus
optimize your performance and even sleep
better touchpoints come in a set to be
worn on either side of the body and can
be purchased at any one of four colorful
options they can be worn as wearables on
your wrist clip to clothing hidden in
pockets or socks are held in each hand
making them useful at any time of day
just 30 seconds of using touch point can
reduce stress by up to 71% we're
currently using the touch points in the
preoperative evaluation so when a
patient comes in for surgery that day we
ask them to raise their level of anxiety
about having surgery and if it's at a
level of 5 or greater we give them the
touch point to hold during their pre-op
evaluation of like their history and
physical process of getting their IV
started it's been phenomenal we've had
really great success and the patients
are loving them and want to buy them to
use at home I purchased touch points you
know because I have a child in the
autism spectrum last year we went
through a very soft time where she
wouldn't even get out of the car for her
favorite activities so I saw the touch
points and
I decided to try it it was very easy to
use our third day with touchpoints she
just ended up coming out of the car and
we were back to our routine so that was
an amazing experience for us working in
the hospital environment just a very
stressful so I use them when I do have
stressful situations and to calm myself
down at work and I actually use mine
quite a bit to relax me after the whole
day it's over my name is Justin white I
work for Arizona industries for the
blind as the touch point solution
Account Manager my specific
responsibilities are I make sure that
orders get out on time I also handle
billing and then any other customer
service inquiries 70% of people who are
visually impaired or blind are
unemployed and I've been visually
impaired all of my life touch point
Solutions has been wonderful about
choosing us as a partner to help bridge
the gap then we have something called
archival clinical data where I have
years of clinical data that we've looked
at then we have the neuroscience
electroencephalogram data which shows a
reduction in the high frequency waves
that are associated with anxiety in less
than 30 seconds so the brain is always
deciding what it's going to do with
regard to stress and it's going to move
you into state of more calm or more
stress most often without your conscious
awareness we know this work and we've
got user data that confirms all of my
prior scientific findings we're
listening to our customers and they're
really asking us for a simpler solution
that's more affordable you know when you
change one kids from going into
fight-or-flight everyday in the
classroom you're affecting that whole
classroom and when you're affecting all
those classrooms you're affecting the
whole school and when you're affecting
entire schools you're affecting the
entire
and it just goes on from there
this is Nuria the first window air
conditioner designed with you in mind
Nuria is 40% smaller than standard air
conditioners and less than six inches
tall unlike typical window air
conditioners Nuria lets you keep your
view Nuria is smart using Android or iOS
users can control Nuria remotely or set
a schedule to save power when no one is
home Nuria can bring fresh air into your
home on those cool September night not
even central air can do that you don't
have to be a bodybuilder to install
Nuria the lightweight frame is installed
first making secure installation a
breeze other window air conditioners
forced you to hold a heavy awkward
object in place for minutes at a time
with Nuria installation is a one-person
job storage is easy allowing you to keep
it under the bed when not needed
