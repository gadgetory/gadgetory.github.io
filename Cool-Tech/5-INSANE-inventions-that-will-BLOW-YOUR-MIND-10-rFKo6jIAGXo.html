hi there I'm dr. Joe Vitale and as many
of you know I'm the CEO of Salonika and
inventor of kaya the natural lighting
robot kaya first premiered on IndieGoGo
distractive chamber and ever since we've
been offering her on IndieGoGo in demand
as a pre-order over the past several
months kaya has evolved past even what I
could have dreamed we have changed her
name for those of you who remember Lucy
and have significantly improved her
design to the point that today we call
the final version kaya 2.0 we are now in
the process of getting kaya manufactured
and the entire Salonika team is
absolutely thrilled that we'll be able
to start shipping soon to our backers in
just a few short months but now let me
tell you a little bit more about what
she does using kaya couldn't be easier
just place in a sunny spot point her
towards the room you want to illuminate
and turn her on she'll find the Sun all
on her own and redirected slides into
your home or office
kaya solar-powered so you never have to
worry if she's charged and she
continuously monitors the movement of
the Sun throughout the day and remembers
where you want to send the sunlight so
you have natural light indoors all day
long if you have a dark or gloomy room
in your home or office
then kaya is for you with more than half
a million dollars raised to date on
IndieGoGo it's been a truly
life-changing experience to see the
amount of support for kaya around the
world as an organization we here at
Salonika believe in the importance of
upgrading our indoor spaces into places
in which we don't only live but we
thrive we won't be on IndieGoGo forever
so I strongly encourage you to take
advantage of our limited pre-order
offers on IndieGoGo and as always have a
great day
you love your push cart it allows you to
walk through the fairways without weight
on your shoulders just how the game is
meant to be played its second-best to
having a caddy but it's a lot of work
until the e wheels buyouts are gone the
first ever device to turn your push cart
into a motorized cart simply attach your
cart to the e wheels with the foot
clashing system and you're ready to go
once mounted the e wheels powers your
cart up to 27 holes with a lithium ion
battery single charge as you play your
clubs trouble with you using a remote
control up to 50 yards away and stops
automatically when the card is out of
range too powerful yet noiseless hub
motors are cleverly integrated in the
wheels providing casual flexible
maneuverability along the fairway thanks
to the wide wheelbase it's extremely
stable on all terrain so you can focus
on your next shot and leave the rest to
us a cruise control feature can be
activated with the push of a button once
it's on it matches your walking speed
going up or down the slopes with the
distance control function you can send
your clubs down the fairway or to the
next tee box the e wheels is a smart
upgrade to your push guard and at just
half the price as compared to other
remote-controlled brands it's really
smart
it's a solid-state unit with no exposed
wires or connectors so you can play in
the rain as it's part of a game we've
been working on this project for over
three years after spending hundreds of
hours on the drawing board thousands of
miles traveling to the suppliers 12
prototype divisions things finally came
together with beer the first hundred
units for making sure we're ready for
mass production and undergoing extensive
testing to each and every component we
now need your help to bring this product
to the market please support us thank
