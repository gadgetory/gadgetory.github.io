the Vinko wallets can stop RFID theft
now using a simple credit card reader
I've got my Samsung s5 and I'm going to
see if I can skim the card through the
pinko wallet and as you can see nothing
happens now I can take my card out and
try that again and all the details come
up on the card the 16 digit card number
the expiry date and the list of other
details that can be used to d4 do a
today to date hey guys my wife and I Hey
we're packing for our trip to Savannah
we've got this new fused smart card
that's going to help us with our
purchases throughout the trip this card
can store information from almost any
card in my wallet debit cards credit
cards reward cards gift cards gym
membership anything with a barcode and
EMV chip a magnetic strip or NFC Tech
View stores it you just swipe or take a
picture of a card through your
smartphone and it appears on whew now
you may be wondering about security
defuse card runs on Bluetooth and
connects directly to your phone it's
necessary you can delete all the
information on the card with the push of
a button I've got my key I've got my
phone I've got my wallet fuse allows you
to select any card to use when you need
it for instance when you pay for gas you
might rather use debit and credit you
can also add your gas paid membership
info you can even use multi pay mode to
combine the two cards for a simpler
transaction view's makes it all easy
I've got like 30 different cars all at
once so it's got my debit cards credit
cards gift cards membership cards that's
awesome
see if it works all right it works
fused has the capability for NFC
technology NFC means you can tap the
card to make contactless payments using
its buttons you can create a six tap
password to lock and unlock the card so
if it ends up in the wrong hand
they won't be able to access your
information by pressing the hold button
for three seconds you can freeze the
fuze card so that your preferred payment
method doesn't accidentally change the
card stays locked and active for ten
minutes unless it's told otherwise
my baby
it's cool too because if you forget your
card your phone will send you an alert
before you get too far away plus its
battery lasts an average of 30 days that
means you have about a month before you
have to worry about recharging it but
when you do have to charge it visas
portable charging cradle has a built in
battery allowing you to charge the card
on the go in Savannah we had the chance
to use the fuse it's pretty awesome that
you can put all this tech into a card
it's thin as this fuse your whole wallet
in one card paying with your mobile

about when you're ready to pay because

the wallet is an essential tool that
each of us uses every day we want in a
while if I could keep up with our busy
lives and enhance them instead of hinder
them that's why we created the elemental
wallet
here's the theory of the elemental
wallet it all started when a friend
gifted me a minimalist wallet which Alba
fell apart six months later I was
frustrated I wanted a minimalist wallet
that was built to laughs more functional
and more aesthetically pleasing that's
why I created my own the first wallet
was stainless steel it was heavy had
sharp edges and the o-rings had a
tendency to pop off this improves the
functionality somewhat but the
aesthetics were still terrible
the next wallet was CNC machined out of
aluminum and the aesthetics were greatly
improved the functionality was also
improved except this while I've had to
have at least three cards to function
and was very expensive to manufacture
finally for the elemental wallet we
chose solid carbon fiber this material
isn't cheap but we have experienced
machining it and know how to do it cost
effectively and hold one to 25 cards
which slide in easily accommodates
additional cash cards or keys and has a
built-in bottle opener solid carbon
fibers they can not protect your cards
light enough to carry anywhere
Kickstarter we love our wallets and we
know you will too but to make them
affordable we need your support
take a look at our pledges and don't
forget to share us with your friends and
family thank you
you
we think about the Archaea wallet we
built to last a lifetime
instead of a cheat material like
aluminum we're using 21st century
composites like carbon fiber but of a
silicon band process crunching and
breaking built-in internal spreading
tensioning stencil into the body of the
homeless as well as the compartment to
hear it with a magnetic latch
when you hold an RKO your hand or design
goal was for you to say okay no that's
different the glare by North American
should look like berries the NGSS ug
fabrication or dropping daily make the
RKO much more than just a wallet it
makes it part of a manufacturing
revolution taking place right now
because open-source hardware with used
to creating your nail and design an
open-source the entire manufacturing
content as a way to help inspire new
makers to build angry
