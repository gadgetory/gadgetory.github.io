proactively built in a 360-degree
speaker with enhanced bass and boosted
treble and cut 9000 holes in the speaker
grill to make capsule the world's first
pico projector with omnidirectional
sound but we didn't just want it to be
small and loud we wanted to make it
really smart traditionally so called

which makes them big and laggy we
integrated the most advanced smartphone
chipset ever used in a pico projector
into capsule making it the smartest
projector the world has ever seen
