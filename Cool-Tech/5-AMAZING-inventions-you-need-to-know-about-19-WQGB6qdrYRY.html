games on it's a really nice concept it's
very different it's it's a good idea and
it's great
I don't like that there's huge amount of
games and you can play games like from
back from 1990s up to the newest Triple
A game laptop and you still it's still
pretty heavy you need a separate bag and
this you can just point putting your
rucksack it's good it's more comfortable
to hold in the hand it's nice
you can plug in a mouse and keyboard to
it with our USB hub that's pretty nice
yeah I liked it really much and look
very promising it seems rather powerful
it's really a promising solution for
mobile gaming with the real PC
experience using steam you can just take
your safe games with you and play along
hi I'm Nick I'm the founder of those
awesome guys and a developer on move or
Die is basically a portable steam box
which is an amazing yeah its Leslie it
looks like a really interesting product
and switch that maybe have a look in
into it I think it's nice for game
developers to have this because you get
dry you build that I made for PC good
thing is awesome you have all the power
in the PC in your hand pretty cool
I mean it's like a no-brainer taking all
your Steam games with your pretty
awesome and it's pretty unbelievable to
be able to hold a windows machine in
your hands that actually works so I'm
super excited to see this as a finished
project I really got to do wise I headed
in my hand and it felt really great you
know the control top step and it was
really exceeding my expectations so yeah
I'm really really looking forward to
getting it
you
you
you see amazing isn't it this is the air
selfie the only portable flying camera
integrated into your mobile phone cover
micro and ultralight it comes with it's
very own device for storage and charging
with an easy one hand control from its
own where did the idea come from well
I'll show you look at this what an epic
day out a bona fide selfie time as they
say just need to squeeze a teeny bit no
oh never mind
ah more manageable group just two guys
actually they wanna take a selfie to
remember this wonderful place well I
guess they can just describe the view to
their friends back home right okay one
more try this time a good old barbecue
outside on a sunny day with lots of
friends let's try the selfie stick
strategy still can't fit everybody in
Annoying situations am i right we've all
been there buddy that's how air selfie
was born a perfect team gathered
together working in London Milan and
Shanghai to combine micro flying
technologies ultralight HD cameras
within flight stability systems air
selfie can travel in a 20-meter radius
and hovers for up to three minutes it's
easily controllable from both iOS or
android smartphone apps it's only 52
grams and it slots into its phone cover
and recharges so what if the guys had an
air selfie with them they make it hover
find the perfect angle and leave the
controls finally snap an amazing photo
with the selfie delay timer mode while
it is autonomously flying and keeping
its position in the air awesome what
about the two explorers they select the
classic flying mode from the three
options available control layer selfie
through the app by holding the phone
horizontally and take both memorable
photos and videos
and what would have happened at the
barbecue enough with the squeezing just
select the selfie mode use only two
buttons to find the right distance to
shoot and take a great picture what
about an indoor location whatever it may
be a party at somebody's house for a
night out in a club there are no issues
there selfie flies easily it's simple of
control and very safe
and once you shoot a great picture don't
keep it to yourself it's so easy to
share it right from your phone as easy
as grabbing the air selfie safely while
it's still hovering in the air so this
is air selfie the only portable flying
camera integrated into your mobile phone
cover ready to explore new perspectives
let's take a look at its technical
features power bank inside its own
custom phone cover a battery that
charges itself in only 30 minutes 5
megapixel HD video camera to shoot
social media optimized images
sophisticated sensors and its own Wi-Fi
control unit in flight stability systems
to hover autonomously the smallest and
most powerful brushless motors it's safe
to grab while it's still hovering and of
course its own 4 gigabyte microSD memory
ultralight with a solid italian-designed
case compact and easy to carry with you
anywhere you go ready for the revolution
air selfie is on kickstarter help us to
get it into production become an air
selfie ambassador by pre-ordering now

hi I'm Andrew and I've invented a new
kind of cup it packs down small / ultra
portability and it pops up big whenever
you need to drink on the go
like most people I really enjoy my
takeaway drinks a few years ago
discovered that most paper cups like
this one and not recycled and go
directly to landfill in the UK alone
over seven million of these are thrown
away every day stacked up would be seven
times taller than Mount Everest every
day so I bought a bunch of travel mugs
and they try to solve the problem but
they were either too big and bulky and
heavy to carry around all day they were
plain and safe or soft and squishy and
unstable or simply leaked in my bag my
idea was simple I needed a reusable cup
that was ultra portable safe and kind to
the planet Peter had built an insulation
so no more cardboard sleeves or the
dreaded double
I love my pokito it's versatile and
super convenient
it's made from strong odorless and FDA
approved materials which won't
compromise the safety or flavor of your
drink
Paquito magnifico
