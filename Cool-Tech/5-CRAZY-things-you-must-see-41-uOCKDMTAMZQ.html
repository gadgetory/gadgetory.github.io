million litres of wine are poured down
the plughole that's a massive 270
million pounds down the drain you know
how it is you crack open that one last
bottle with friends the weekend and then
the rest ends up on your kitchen counter
for three days exposed to oxygen and
your vino turns to vinegar sure this
wine preservation device is out there
but they're either ineffective as the
wine is still in contact with some air
or expensive and you tied in too pricey
refills which got me thinking they had
to be a better way to preserve your
wines full flavor no matter how much you
had left so I came up with a tall simple
elegant and it really works here's how
to count your whole bottle into ëtil
this opens up the wine and brings out
its character pour yourself a glass the
sharp lip gives drip-free pouring but
then here's the magic push down on the
neck and the unique patented design
forms a complete seal preventing any
further contact with oxygen to preserve
your wines full flavor
ideally store etter in the fridge to
keep both white and red in perfect
condition until you decide it's time for
another glass then simply tip ëtil and
the innovative valve automatically opens
as you pour no gases no pumping that can
strip wine of its flavor just good
practical design
California roll by lemon uses Bluetooth
pain with their smartphone to activate
the voice recognition feature what will
the weather be like today California
will see some sunshine today with the
touch of a button
California roll can manage and send text
messages answer questions tell Peter
I'll be picking him and Sarah up in five
minutes

three-dimensional space thanks to NASA
solar technology California roll by
lemon is completely self sustainable
California roll is waterproof shockproof
and temperature proof allowing with your
music to follow you from the beach to
the water put pairing capabilities your
smartphone can wirelessly connect to
multiple speakers to pump up the volume

this feature limit hello physical change
in a way you listen to music
we all know what it's like to leave our
dog at home every day when we need to go
to work they have to stay alone from
nine to seven and that's not fun for
them or for you so for you and your dog
we created Lika Lika is a life companion
for your dog it is similar to a mobile
terrestrial robot that you can control
with your smartphone from anywhere like
us equipped with a camera a microphone a
speaker and the tree tosser that can be
used to reward your dog this makes your
dog love Laika while having fun play
times together we also developed a
tracker to keep tabs on your dog and
adapt based on your dog's behavior so if
you're busy and your dog needs attention
like is autonomous mode turns on and
take care of your dog until you're back
over the past few years the smartphone
has become the single most important
communication device that we use on a
daily basis no matter where we are we
need it to stay in contact with those
around us however smart phones are
entirely dependent on a communication
infrastructure that they use what
happens when this infrastructure becomes
unreliable or is non-existent for
instance when we are out in the wild
traveling abroad when there are too many
users congesting the network or when a
natural disaster knocks down existing
cellular towers that's why we created
the sonic a wireless communication of
ice that enables your smartphone to send
instant messages voice recordings image
data and GPS locations even when there
is no internet access or cellular
coverage how does it work simply connect
your smartphone to the Wi-Fi access
point on the sonnet and it will transmit
the data sent from your phone to other
sonnet users via long-range radio
frequency no cellular data no satellite
service and no monthly subscription the
typical range for point-to-point
communication with the sonnet is
approximately five kilometres for three
miles
it also supports mesh networking that
can dramatically increase its effective
range by securely relaying data through
other SONET devices in the area
the sonnet is designed specifically for
use in the outdoors it is rated ip66
meaning that it's dust tight and water
resistant the sonnet is powered by a
four thousand milliamp hour battery that
allows you to use it continuously for up
to 24 hours as a built-in USB port so
that you can even charge your phone with
it on the software side is the sunnat'
app an intuitive instant messenger that
draws upon the familiar user experience
in addition the sonnet app comes with
useful features such as offline maps and
real-time location sharing so that you
always know where you are in relation to
your friends in the case of an emergency
the sonnet app has a panic button which
will activate the SOS mode broadcasting
your distress call in your current GPS
location to any sonnet users in range
we've been developing the sonnet for
over a year now and are super excited
but as possibilities our prototypes are
now complete and we're ready to move in
a full production that's where you come
in we're looking for your support to
bring this form a decentralized
communication into the mainstream sana
is just the beginning and we're so
grateful for you to be a part of it
thank you for your help
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
