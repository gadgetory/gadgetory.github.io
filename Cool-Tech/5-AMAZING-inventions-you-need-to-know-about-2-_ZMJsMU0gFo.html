hot tea and so do we but there's a
problem the electric kettle everyone
always overfill it heating excess water
and wasting energy research proves that
one day of extra energy use from
overfilling electric kettles it's enough
to light all the streetlights in England
for a night with meto we set out to
solve this problem meter only heats as
much water as you need in the vessel of
your choice simply fill your cup with
water place it onto the induction base
and immerse the rod in the liquid the
base then heats the disc of the rod
which heats the liquid surrounding it
giving you the exact amount of hot water
you wanted we focused on a simple and
elegant design that is intuitive to use
me to adjust to your needs you can heat
milk for a hot chocolate or warm up the
food for your baby are you having guests
over no problem just prepare an entire a
tea kettle for everyone to share mito
starred is a graduation project and now
a year and a half later we have a
working prototype we have been working
endlessly on the design and the user
experience and the electronics
revolutionize how the liquids will be
heated in the future over the course of
last few months we want multiple
innovation and design awards and
thousands of people reached out to us
asking for meto
now our next chapter begins and we need
your support it's time to be gearing up
for manufacture and that requires huge
resources media is a small product but
with the big impact imagine the positive
change we could make if everybody
started using neato so let's leave a
mark in this world even if it's just a
scratch

let's face water can be lots of fun
until we need to drink it sure we know
it's healthy but it just doesn't taste
as exciting as all those flavored drinks
which means we drink a lot less water
and a whole lot more that job hey and
that's a problem a very big problem so
we decided to put some fun into drinking
water with the right cup it's the
world's first ever fruit-flavored cup
designed to get people drinking more
water sure it might look simple but it
actually took six years of research and
patented technologies to get where we
are today and we believe it's going to
be a real game food so how does it work
well for starters our brain identifies
flavor using two main senses taste and
smell that's why we inserted innovative
fda-approved fruit scent and flavor
directly into the right cup so when you
drink water from it your nose fix up the
fruity aroma your tongue senses the hint
of a sweet taste and your brain yells
when in fact you're only drinking
natural water oh wow sounds great but
does it work well we asked ourselves a
very same question so we put the right
cup to the test with our orange flavored
prototype
whoa okay wow you're kidding me right
what's in this it's not just water
tastes like something else just water
it's crazy brilliant just brilliant now
that we know that it works let's meet
the team behind the idea for years I've
been researching a lecturing about scent
marketing showing how easy it is to
manipulate the brain with smell when I
was 30 I was diagnosed as diabetes and
my doctors told me to drink only water
but I hated the taste that's when I came
up with the idea for the right cup
after years of research and development
we've reached the stage where we need
your support to turn the right cup into
reality the right cup is great for
anyone who wants to cut down on sugary
drinks and drink more water which is
basically everybody please help us
change lives of millions of people by
supporting our project on IndieGoGo
together we can make a real difference
and turn the world into a better and
healthier place one cup at a time let's
make drinking water fun again
