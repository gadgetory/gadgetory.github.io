about 50 gallon sized nylon bag with
just one breath this is called the
Bernoulli effect watch what we made of
it
I love going outdoors staying connected
with great Mother Nature and staying
connected with family and friends I love
sharing my adventures but I've realized
that it's really hard to get access to
electricity to stay connected outdoors
the thing is today's mobile devices use
significantly less power than
traditional consumer electronics so one
day I came up with the idea what if we
could convert every energy resource into
personal power I want to introduce you
to e stream it's a portable water power
generator it converts any type of
running water into stored energy you can
get personal on-demand power with
nothing but water energy this is how it
works
remove the cover unfold the turbines and
lock them
hook and release eastream into running
water let it spin freely to generate
electricity and it charges the built-in
battery it takes approximately 4.5 hours
to fully charge one
eastream which can charge up to three
smartphones GoPros or tablet PCs two
times faster than charging through an
outlet
you can also use it as a lantern with
four different modes even underwater
eastream works well even in weak
currents or behind a kayak and
regardless of the weather or time of day
it fits perfectly into any sized
backpack it's ideal for use while you
enjoy camping fishing kayaking biking or
any other outdoor activities we didn't
start it just to charge a smartphone at
the campsite we wanted to provide a
personal on demand energy our goal is to
discover every energy resource around
you and convert them into your own power
we've been working hard to get here to
meet you
our journey has just begun please join
us in our adventure let's embark on this
journey together to stay connected as
one
I know sergeant Steve Nebraska thank you
thank you
if you're like me you love escaping into
the outdoors on camping and backpacking
adventures but a problem we face again
and again is that each trip calls for a
specific tent an ultralight shelter when
it's just me the two-person tent when
the body tag is long and something
bigger for a group a cotopaxi we set out
to solve this problem we're introducing
the new NT to tent system offering you
one streamlined setup that adapts to
your specific needs our system is made
up of a two-person standalone 10 it's
rain fly and a snap-in alcove that
seamlessly integrates with the tent
the in-situ itself sleeps two features a
double wall construction and uses just
three holes for super easy setup it has
just the right blend of features for
your lightweight backpacking camping
adventure
the simple lightweight body looks
perfect for one or two person
backpacking
and the included rain fly with dual
integrated vestibules lets you batten
down the hatches when the weather turns
now the alcove also known as the tents
guestroom it's a separate shelter that
seamlessly integrates with your indy to
effectively doubling the space with two
extra people or added gear many other
tent makers use some type of vestibule
or awning and claim it adds living space
but only ours features a built in floor
to create more space that protects you
from the ground up just like the tent on
its own the alcoves simple setup and
multiple stake out points means it
serves as an ultra light and minimal
two-person standalone sofa
it can be set up in two separate
configurations lasted to a tree for a
larger opening or stake it down with
trekking poles with the nt2 tent system
we're filling the gap in the market our
system is made to adapt to any camping
situation three tents minute one
streamlined system
from the initial concept to final design
into two tenses into something need them
super excited
tens continue to get lighter and more
technical but overall design hasn't
really changed until now our system
solved the problem and we know it'll
help eliminate your tenth conundrums to
making your time in the outdoors much
more fun and hassle-free but the final
step of our journey in getting the first
batch of nt2 tent systems produced and
how to market involves you doing our
campaign and get your in g2 in time to
enjoy the summer camping season thanks
for watching and for the support of
everything we're doing
are you into sports uh-huh I really like
inliner
you know wingding hair my favorite song
the freedom
well except for those heavy shoes I've
got a hole in my backpack
and what about hiking sure I love hiking
being out in nature is where I can
unwind and get new ideas it's just
really a drag lugging around those heavy
boots all day then why don't we use
Skinner's water Skinner's Skinner's the
most ultra portable Footwear in the
world also I mean they're like super
cool
Skinner's are light yet very durable
they fit into your pocket don't slip and
have a cooling effect and best of all
seriously yep you can throw them in the
washer
scanners were designed to be worn
anywhere anytime like an hour wedding
okay
well almost any time if you're tired of
carrying an extra pair of shoes with you
all the time try Skinner's they're
lightweight portable comfort simply put
its Footwear tuned to perfection okay so
I can have Skinner's with me all the
time like when we take a trip to Japan
again exactly that's right you can date
them pretty much anywhere hi Kickstarter
I'm Peter and here at Skinner's we spend
the last 18 months developing a better
alternative to your heavy clunky food
where many of us were learning travel or
exercise well we found an easier way
both for you and your feet our
patent-pending technology says goodbye
to glues and themes that could fall
apart over time Skinner's are
manufactured in Europe using the finest
Swedish materials with a dual coding of
extra durable anti abrasive polymer and
we've tested them all over the world
in all kinds of conditions to make sure
they can keep up with you wherever you
go
we even have guys running marathons in
them long story short very excited with
how Skinner's turned out and the way
they feel and protect your feet and
people are surprised to see how
something so simple can be so durable
the next step is to give more people the
chance to experience Skinner's for
themselves
and to do that we need your help simply
put Skinner's are designed to be
multifunctional as you are
you
backpacking is adventure it's a journey
through the wilderness seeing beautiful
sights and carrying everything you need
to survive in your pack if I can pick
the two most important things about my
gear they would be make it lightweight
and make it reliable
a Kickstarter's my name is Kevin and I'm
introducing the vertex ultralight
backpacking stone this stove has a
patent-pending curved construction that
provides incredible strength while only
weighing 1.8 ounces light enough that
you won't even notice it in your pack
the unique design facts completely flat
and the flexible pieces assemble in
seconds with no tools it has no moving
parts valves bull rings or seals that
can wear out
the stove uses solid fuel tablets that
burn at 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit and
only weigh 14 grams each the curved
sides of the stove shield the burning
tablet from wind and also serve as a pot
stand for added versatility the stove is
also designed to support the Trangia
alcohol burner that is popular with many
minimalist backpackers and uses
denatured alcohol fuel that can be
purchased at any hardware store I've
tested several rounds of prototypes and
fine-tuned the design now I need your
help to take this project to the next
level if you appreciate the simplicity
of ultralight backpacking I hope you'll
consider supporting me on Kickstarter
