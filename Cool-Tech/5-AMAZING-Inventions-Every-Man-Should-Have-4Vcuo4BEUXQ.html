we live in a world today where so much
natural beauty of this world remains
there is so much to see so much to
experience so much nature to explore it
would be a waste not to see more if
there was a way to save the nature we
have untouched and unspoiled from modern
industrialism would you take part and
support it with the protection of nature
in mind we created wama under oil the
world's best hemp underwear for both men
and women our key ingredient hemp is
often referred to as the miracle plant
for how versatile it is and how much
good it can do for nature as a textile
hemp is known to have antibacterial
antimicrobial and even anti-odor
properties and we all have that special
area on our bodies that carries the most
bacteria along with odor that is why we
created wama underwear you know to take
care of your privates we believe
everyone deserves to cover their
privates with a natural fabric like ham
available we have a men's boxer briefs
and a women's hipsters design both
designs went through dozens of patterns
and samples until the fit was perfected
every stitch every centimeter every
detail was developed with the highest
quality standards the design is simple
yet stylish and with him fabric being
naturally breathable you can rest
assured these would be the most
naturally comfortable underwear you have
ever worn because wama isn't just a pair
of hemp underwear it's a fashionable
everyday underwear that you will feel
good about wearing and by backing this
campaign today you are not only helping
bring wama underwear to life you are
supporting the hemp movement in the
fashion world by bringing more awareness
to him and all of its benefits why do we
need wireless charging pockets because
of the convenience and practicality you
don't want to be seen carrying around a
brick that still has wires on it the
snow see looks and feels just like a
regular jacket except it isn't the snow
see smart jacket is the most innovative
and useful of all smart apparel it
simply lets you charge your phone
wirelessly inside of your pockets and
this is available for men and women in
Arctic silver or black ice wireless
charger today would never get the job
done like we wanted it to so we decided
to reinvent them using our own
technology our wireless chargers are
twenty times thinner than a standard
wireless charger four times thinner than
a credit card and breaks three different
records including the only flexible
wireless charger on the market the snow
seat is built for the outdoors and the
everyday person although it's incredible
technology that's housed in the jacket
it can be used for skiing hiking and
even kayaking due to its water-resistant
coating the jacket uses a 3000 mAh
battery which sends power up to the
wireless charger which is located in the
breast pocket
you can easily use your own battery
because of our open battery
compatibility we designed everything so
is intangible by hiding the technology
and wanting the user to feel like they
are wearing a noble jacket that will
keep you warm the cable the wireless
charger and the battery is so
lightweight and placed accordingly so
you won't even know it's there
our Chargers are compatible with all Qi
enabled phones and use a free special
adapter for phones that armed with your
help we can move into a new way of
charging your phone wireless charging
inside of your pockets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
