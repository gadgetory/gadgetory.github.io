hi I'm max and I love the sweet smooth
taste of cold brewed coffee that's why I
invented a great way to make it at home
the brew filter patent-pending cold brew
coffee is the kind of coffee that making
cold water instead of hot water and so
that doesn't extract the acids from a
coffee bean so it's really smooth really
sweet and it's an amazing cup of coffee
so the first step is to take a mason jar
like this with coffee grounds and you
add some water to it
awesome now we just put the lid on and
now this is going to sit in the fridge
for about 24 hours
next take the brew
and put it straw side down into your
coffee
you
any take an empty mason jar and you put
it on top now all you got to do is flip
it and give it a nice shake
you
smart shades automates your window
shades in minutes making your home
smarter connect smart shades to your
phone now control your window shades
from your smartphone personal
intelligent simple hi I'm Krista and I'm
Lisa there are hundreds of cases in the
news every year about kids who aren't
where their parents thought they were
supposed to be some of these stories
have tragic ends and we couldn't believe
how frequently this was happening so we
decided to solve the problem ourselves
by creating deco the toddler monitor a
cute and friendly motion sensor device
that is easily set up hang deco on your
toddler's bedroom door and set it from
the smartphone using the toddler monitor
app if your toddler tries to leave their
bedroom the device will sense the motion
of the door and send a Bluetooth signal
to your smartphone you will be notified
via the toddler monitor app if there is
movement at the door and you will know
that your toddler is on the move
Decco hangs on any style of doorknob
it's durable and water-resistant made
from food grade bpa-free material
lightweight and travels well it's
controlled by an iPhone or Android app
the app manages up to three toddler
monitors at once from a single
smartphone the app can also be
controlled by up to three users at once
it uses reliable Bluetooth technology
and has an easily replaceable coin cell
battery we're not saying this will solve
all your teeth far from it but it will
give you the peace of mind that comes
with knowing that your child is safe and
sound
and where they're supposed to be
you
