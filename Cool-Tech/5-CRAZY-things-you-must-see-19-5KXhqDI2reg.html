I love to barbecue and I love to grill
there's just something about the taste
Hickory this Keith alder and cherry mmm
juiciness you get from a slow cooker now
I just use my D grills wood pellet grill
I can smoke grill bake brain roast and
BBQ all in one I have to say it's my new
secret weapon the grills automatically
moves wood pellets into the electric
burner at a consistent rate for even
heating the fire never touches the food
keeping it from unwanted charring after
plugging Z grills in just tell d grills
whether you like to smoke or cook
providing that great wood flavor with
the ease and convenience for the gas
grill using a gas grill you just don't
get that natural wood flavor and aroma
and charcoal grills are just too messy
it's difficult to control when you start
or stop cooking after my prep it
straight into the Z grills you smoke and
cook all in one place besides the
convenience of smoking and grilling at
the turn of a dial I can also make this
delicious wood-fired pizza the girls
digital temperature control makes it
easy for me to step away for the more
important well more fun things now that
you know all of my grilling secrets get
one for yourself at an amazing price get
yourself a Z grill the lead 900 today
