the sound of life isn't a single track
its a mix a combination of what you
choose to play and what's around you
it's awareness mixed with attitude
countryside mixed with connections
perseverance mixed with presence
introducing Trek titanium revolutionary
sport headphones with a completely open
air design built to deliver situational
awareness comfort and an exceptional
audio experience with bone conduction
technology many vibrations travel
through your cheekbones directly to the
inner ears delivering dynamic stereo
sound without covering or blocking them

with the introduction of the new treks
titanium really a radical departure from
your traditional headphones a true
uncompromised product that we really
believe will become the ultimate sport
center Vanessa headphones generate
vibration and the vibration is comes out
through our facial bone into our in a
year for example when I put these
headphones on and you see that they're
seeing up here against my cheek what's
going to happen now is that you
music is going to start to vibrate and
that vibration is going to go through my
cheekbone and then to my cochlea which
will allow me to listen to the music we
built in a new technology into our
headsets called premium pitch plus it
allows us to create a listening
environment that's on par with any of
your air but people should expect this
exceptional audio and that we believe

hi I'm Ryan I'm Valerie thanks for
checking out zooming we all love our
shoes because all the laces present some
challenges there's the time the
squeezing of floppy bow the coming
undone
the double nodding and the untying to
get them off well with your support
squeezing zubat can help do it are small
yet powerful magnetic fit that you
attach to your own too late making your
shoes very easy too strong how do you
really want to put your shoes well
wouldn't it be great if there were no
laces at all I mean nothing to get in
the way well this is what do bits are
like when separated Lubitz eliminate
three rows of lasers so there's a huge
mouth opening deeply slide in
then just connect the magnet
and that's it
now go for a run
go to the playground
go to the gym
play some basketball
lubitz hold securely for most
recreational activities all right so
stupid they're not just for athletic
sneakers therefore your everyday casual
shoot with stupid you have a clean
looking shoe no ugly bows and they'll
never come undone
how do you really want to take your
shoes off let's face it most of us do
what we are not supposed to do we step
on our heel and squeeze out of our shoes
this wears down the heel and leaves you
with a not so untie later so let's do
this stepping out of your shoes becomes
the right way to do it the magnets look
split and step out and now your shoe is
open and ready for the next time you
want
lubitz are not ordinary Magnus they've
been specially engineered to concentrate
the magnetic forces for the face with
the magnetic this gives them incredible
folding forces in a small size it's also
means there's almost no magnetism on the
outside of the groove is where you don't
want
welcome to the world's most evolved
robot vacuum it's not a sweeper like
other robots it's a true vacuum the most
powerful automated vacuum you can buy
the most clever course with its advanced
laser vision neato scans and maps the
room and adjust as it goes while others
just pump around neato is off on a
mission to clean and a methodical
pattern moving from room to room and a
fraction of the time it systematically
goes around things in its path over
multiple surfaces and away from anywhere
you mark as Novak territory it detects
and avoid stairs and knee toes
low-profile eases underneath where the
dust bunnies go and you they're not
neato skis in the dark and seeks out
unsuspecting dirt then with its extra
large filter it stealthily sucks up more
dirt dust debris and pet hair than any
other robot vacuum knee toes wide brush
and side brushes get up close and
personal with walls and baseboards and
gets in corners where round vax can if
it runs out of juice neato is so much
smarter it goes back to its charge base
and starts right back where it left off
neato works how you schedule it for
cleaning every day so quick spot clean
or an instant multi room cleaning then
it goes right back to its charge base
for next time leaving no spot unpacked
and other robot vacuums in the done
neato
