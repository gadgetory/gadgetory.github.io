with blue narrow at Kelvin we love
making coffee at home and the ritual
that comes with it but the roast of the
beans the most important factor in our
coffees flavor has always been
completely out of our control we want to
change that this is Kelvin a home coffee
roaster that turns roasting into
something you can do from your
countertop we use to accept that someone
else roasted our coffee for us with
industrial machines a while ago these
pre roasted beans cost us fifteen to
twenty dollars a bag and start to get
stale the instant you open them
we knew we could make coffee roasting
simple enough to do at home so we
created the Kelvin home coffee roaster
Kelvin lets you start with green beans
straight from the source and roast them
to your exact taste for one-third the
price
to create Kelvin we immerse ourselves in
coffee culture to understand the details
of the roasting process and tested every
technology available to produce the
simplest most effective roaster with no
complicated routines all you need to do
is set the roast time and let Kelvin do
the rest
Kelvin uses hot air to evenly roast the
beans it heats up to the right degree
and it automatically cools down the
beans after the roast has ended Kelvin
even filters out the chaff during the
roasting process making cleanup a cinch
to make sure you always have a supply of
fresh beans we also created an app that
allows you to choose your beans from all
over the world with our suggestions for
different roasts that way you can enjoy
a range of flavors each time you roast
Kelvin can roast enough beans for a cup
or an entire pot of coffee we want
everyone to be able to have control over
the most important factor in their
coffees flavor our team of experts have
dedicated their years of experience into
making Kelvin beautiful technically
feasible and easy to use with your help
we can make home coffee roasting simple
and let you discover a new side for
coffee
