the shapeshifter the shapeshifter sunhat
is truly revolutionary and it's the last
Sun Hat you'll ever need my pals and I
are going to show you the improvements
I've made to conventional Sun hats the
shapeshifter has a durable bendable wire
built into the brim that not only bends
to any shape but holds that shape and
won't break after multiple bends the
shape shifters brim will not fold or
flop and wind up to 65 miles an hour
lock the chin strap hit the trail and
tell mother nature to do her worst other
wind plate activities like cruising in a
convertible or casual cycling are a
breeze with the shapeshifter
the shapeshifter also fits well over a
winter cap or jacket hood keep the rain
off your face even in a torrential
downpour the brim won't buckle and it
floats bend it to any shape that suits
you while hiking so the brim doesn't
smack your pack or make sure the brim
doesn't hit your back while you're
playing sports
fine-tune the brim as much as you want
if you like sports shooting bend the
side up when you need to for a clear
shot
if photo shooting is more your thing
flip the brim up easily take your shot
put it right back down or do the same if
you want to actually see your face in
the photo while leaving the hat on
relying solely on a neck cape and the
sweltering heat can make for some sweaty
times from the lack of ventilation but
for those occasions a cape will suit you
the shapeshifter comes with a cape that
tucks into a pouch under the brim that
can be deployed when you need it if you
work outside in industries like
agriculture or landscaping you know how
hard it can be to store your Sun Hat
they're just not meant for bags but
thanks to the durable and bendable brim
cable you can fold up the shapeshifter
and fit it easily in your tool bag
backpack messenger bag small day bag or
a purse if you're mowing lawns or
working on a tractor and don't have a
bag on you
you can even slip it into a pocket it's
also perfect for days out to sporting
events concerts the beach and picnics in
the park
and fishing
the shapeshifter also comes with a zip
off crown it's a great way to avoid
sweaty hat hair especially for those
with long thick hair who might not want
it squashed down or maybe you just like
to let your hair fly free</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
