to keep the people we love safe and
that's why we made salt the first safe
gun for safe home hi I'm Adam this is
Andy we're the creators of salt salt is
a gun but it's not like any gun that
you've ever seen it was designed around
the belief that a firearm shouldn't have
to take a life in order to protect a
life from that simple idea
we started by completely rethinking the
bullet instead of LED salt was designed
to shoot a specialized round filled with
powerful toxin so instead of killing the
target salt opens up on impact in the
cloud that instantly causes respiratory
and visual distress so while an intruder
or a curious child would be
incapacitated encounter wouldn't be
fatal
this rethink also lets salt be used not
only offensively but defensively as well
so if an intruder is kicking down your
door
salt allows you to shoot the area around
it before the danger is on top of you
this creates a protective cloud of toxin
between you and the intruder before ease
ever a threat to you or your family our
last big idea was to make salt easy to
use for everyone so we replace the
violent bang of black powder with the
silent power of compressed air the
result is a fear free user experience so
the only person that should have
anything to be scared of is an intruder
and that's all a safe gun for a safe
home so if your is intrigued by the
ideas as we are we'd love to make you
want just click our support button and
together we can make the world just a
little bit safer
Oh
every year millions of houseplants died
because of too little or too much water
unsuitable temperature overly dry air
bad lighting or simple lack of love my
name is Johnny I'm the happiest house
plan in the world but I too is once
close to death then one day my owner
brought grovyle home and I realized the
owner still loves me and cares about me
Grobe is a smart watering system it
waters me when necessary and controls
what I receive just as much water as I
need bro vo monitors my health in
real-time and tracks moisture air
humidity temperature and light intensity
now I have another close friend who
takes care of me my owner can safely
leave for business trips for up to 45
days because I have Gro vo to look after
me now I can tell my owner what I need
what's wrong and what can be done about
it
that's super handy
also I can be moved anywhere because
grow vo is wireless and we can sit
together where our human wants us to
what's more now I can have me friends
because grow vo can manage even three
flowers with their individual watering
settings the grow vo app helps our owner
be sure we're healthy and happy all the
time
how you stutter
I'm Pollack and I'm the founder of rural
I believe we can do more to save our
favorite house plants from drying out
it's not just a smart device that
controls environment of your home but it
also provides an interactive access to
all your farm you can respond to their
needs in real time we have finished the
design and are about to start the mass
production that's why we need your help
over the last two years we've built
dozens of models and for work in
Paradise it's relatively we created and
improve the user interface experience to
make it more practical and useful
support grow your campaign to make our
world a bit greener place thank you
that's me I don't want to die efficient
oh why because I hate my towels these
ones don't really dry me anymore
Twilight throwing water around with
moist and paper in these ones like your
house here one thing to think with a
little more water first
but then they stay wet they start to
smell musty which means there's bacteria
going and maybe even fungus of course
you could avoid those been washing and
drying your towels every day and it was
I'm glad
my search for a better tunnel I found a
staggering number of options mostly just
variations of the name old town so cut
through the conclusion I took a
different approach on that redefines
what a towel should be this is beyond
been done perfectly designs week cork
and waffle weave is what makes the
delivering the multi-layer through a
flush of the thought of an exfoliating
texture and drag like job depended on it
having maximum surface area of the navel
to couch tried compacted it was
important that the dry towel is the
clean the palate is great and they has
proceeded by me and him one read and
even him shower time is a daily ritual
for me the first yeah even before coffee
why do I care so much about a towel well
the lens pickup must be held with don't
work properly and and know if you can
close your chairman frustration so this
is my solution and therefore drying off
from ever felt it light our exposure to
it during the day is the key to our
health

circadian rhythm but too much or too
little light at the wrong time disrupts
our natural body clock so we have

to help you sink your body clock so you
can feel more alive in September 2016 we
moved to Shenzhen China the ROS capital
of electronics for four months to refine
our concepts various manufacturing
experts testing hundreds of prototype
iterations with our design finalized and
rigorously tested we are now ready for
the help of you Kickstarter to help
bring search idea to reality with your
support we can invest into tooling and
scale production the journey to a better
you doesn't just start with a smartphone
sleep tracker or lamb it's much more
than that
let circadian find and thank you to your
perfect with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
