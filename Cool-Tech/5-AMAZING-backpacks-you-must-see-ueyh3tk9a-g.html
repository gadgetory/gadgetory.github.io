never gonna have to deal with a dead
phone again the solar bank is a
removable unit which has a solar panel
and battery with enough power to charge
an iphone 6 up to 12 times you can
charge the solar bank via USB then when
you're out and about the solar panel
keeps the power topped up the solar bank
also has built-in Bluetooth speakers so
you have great sounding audio with you
when you're on the go life back has an
integrated lock this means you can lock
the zipper shut when you're on the go
and what's really cool about this lock
is that you can actually lock the bag to
something when you're sitting still
because of the unique design of the
zippers you can also lock the zipper
shut while locking it to a fixed point
the bottom of the cable can not be
removed and the exit point is reinforced
so it's super strong also the end of the
lock works is a bottle opens cheers
salud some things go the work zone is
incredibly organized is a separate
section for your laptop iPad there's a
space for your wallet there's a key hook
business cards pens there's also a
section for loose papers in a separate
pocket so you don't lose receipts in the
life zone is a protected pocket for your
sunglasses as room for clothes and any
of your non-work stuff because you don't
want your undies falling out in a work
meeting because we all know that's
happened is that just me that's happened
to there are four hidden compartments on
this bag on your shoulder straps or two
pockets these are big enough for credit
cards travel cards for the subway or
Metro cash loose change or even your
headphones pressed up to your back or
two more hidden pockets these are ideal
for your passport and boarding card
these pockets are even big enough for an
iphone six-plus and on one side there's
a USB plug that connects to the solar
mass so you can charge your phone up
