I click stutters my name is Joseph and I
knew Hannes and yes we are twins and we
are cooking but there are some parts of
it that we don't like fortunately we
found a solution
I'm a chef in a restaurant the network
have this promise every day in
professional kitchens it's all about a
good workflow and a tiny world place one
day we had a hard day
and a lot to do I have seen that one of
my colleagues took a container placed it
underneath his cutting rod and chopped
the vegetables straight into the
container and that impressed me it was
so fast and clean that I thought I
wanted chopping board that works exactly
like this I started searching for one
but I couldn't find anything so we made
one we had loads of ideas and we build
many prototypes we finally found
something that brings it all together
and we are so proud to share it a you to
take so it is basically a regular
chopping board but it brings a
professional workflow to your home it
has these brackets that can be pulled
out to take up containers
now this takes a kitchen bird to a whole
new level use one of the containers for
waste then the other one for chopped
food and simply shift it off the board
into the container
the third container and we use four
tools so this is great but what this one
it gets even better it's designed to
give you quick access to your favorite
ingredients to a you cooking session so
your chopping board has now become a
project organized working place
the whole system is based on these
custom on containers which is the word
for a standard for containers in
professional kitchens the flower doget
comes in two different sizes and we
designed the Phoenix which takes the
whole system even a separate
Kickstarter's we spent the last three
years on this project and we invested a
lot of money on the patterns and the
developed now we are ready to launch and
we need your help we need as many
pre-orders as possible to get the
production started and to set up our
company so if you love cooking and if
you like the idea we just say it
straight you should buy one you'll get
the very best chopping board and to help
us getting started and if you don't like
