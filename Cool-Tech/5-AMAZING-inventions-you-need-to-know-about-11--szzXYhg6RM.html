review empowering you to frame amazing

takes to use them how much with those of
you professional photographers paid just
combine all that equipment into this
small and portable of a package this is
cam buddy pro unlock your true potential
as a photographer our final prototype is
ready for production support our
campaign and help us deliver this
amazing product to everyone
do you remember the first time you
stream the video on your smartphone at
that moment you are no longer tied to
your living room for your entertainment
or to your office for work you could
access your content anywhere but there's
one small problem your small mobile
device screen almost all of us prefer
large displays for entertainment and for
work and those work deadlines are
approaching a large desktop monitor our
dual screen setup will significantly
boost your productivity so what if there
is a way to have the mobility of a phone
tablet or laptop without losing the
benefit of a large screen sounds
impossible but that's exactly what we
did introducing spud the spontaneous
pop-up display spud is a high resolution
24 inch display that collapses down to
the size of a book and weighs less than
two pounds this revolutionary product is
the first truly collapsible display and
the only device that gives you both
portability and a large screen for
entertainment and productivity sorel the
spot design process we focus on image
quality and ease of use we use the
latest projection technology combined
with our own custom optics to project a
large high quality image over very short
distance this enables spa to produce a
bright sharp image that's about four
times larger than a laptop screen and 23
times larger than a smartphone screen
to mix but as easy to use as possible we
designed to work just like a ruggedized
number you can pop up the screen in a
very intuitive way and you have this bus
set up and run in less than 10 seconds
and sings but it's also lightweight
battery-powered and uses a hassle-free
hdmi connection you can get straight to
the big screen you want without wasting
any time on set up one of the most
exciting things about spud is the many
different ways that you can use on the
entertainment side spud is basically a
portable TV or movie screen whether
you're traveling camping hanging out
with friends at a coffee shop or just
lounging around your house it's the big
screen that you can use anywhere for
work having a dual screen setup is great
productivity but you can also use it for
presentations and it's a collaboration
it's great for tradeshows sales visits
are any kind of field work spud gives
you the flexibility you need no matter
the situation and it's great because
it's a complete solution in a very small
package that you can take anywhere we
have the team the product and the vision
to execute on spud and now all we need
is your support by backing us on
Kickstarter you're becoming part of our
founding community as a special thank

Kickstarter backers to an exclusive VIP
list that gives you early access to
discount codes product updates and beta
testing opportunities so Kickstarter
what will you do with your spud
hello world I'm free three years ago I
had this big idea I wanted to build the
male body the smartphone nail art
printer and after hard work and
perseverance we did the nail bot uses
your phone to print art directly onto
your fingernails and it's instant here's
how it works first prep your nail you
have to manually paint your nails with a
light colored base coat we recommend
white because it really makes that
artpop next personalized choose the
images you'd love to print whether it's
pictures from your camera roll of your
best friends your dog your cat are one
of our 3,000 free emojis and icons in
our mobile app and eventually your own
art designs finally tap print and about
5 seconds that art will appear
you
I'm a product manager here prima donna
I'm a coder but I'm also an artist and
then developing the nail bot we have
created a product that truly meets art
with engineers
it's fast it's simple I can print my
school mascot on my nails I can wear
them to all the football games all the
spirit weeks and all my friends say how
did you get that I said that I did it I
created it myself with the nail pot so
I'm in college I'm really busy and I'm
always studying but I also want to go
out and have my nails are good too um so
the nail bought just gets it done for me
in like five seconds like in and out and
I'm out the door and it's way better
than I could ever do so thanks no bot
the real MVP I'm Brandi Olsen I'm Lauren
Olsen more from Palo Alto and we love
and a lot i think the nail bot is really
awesome because it integrates math
science technology art and you can print
whatever you want on the nail bot on
your nails and that's just super awesome
i really like that idea we built the
nail bot for you for the engineers the
hackers the coders the artists the maker
girls so three percent of this nail bot
campaign will go towards teaching the
next generation the tech behind the nail
by your our partnership with maker girl
our ambassador program and our art and
coding tutorials if you want your nail
bot we need your help today early
backers will get a significantly
discounted price and access to beta test
our mailbox the nail bot is powered by
smart and dynamic technologists we call
ourselves prima donnas and together with
your support we can build seriously fun
technology with the next generation of
girls
