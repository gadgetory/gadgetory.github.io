building consumer electronics products
for most of my life trying to bring the
enjoyment of music to music lovers
around the world there's millions of
products around the world with my name
on them they've been bought mostly
because people really like the way they
sound and like the way they look so I've
started a new company called coma audio
and the first product is here called
solo this product was conceived to take
all of the forms of content delivery
available today to the music lever and
make them all accessible without the use
of an app or a remote control by simply
touching a button so one can set these
presets and have a choice of the
favorites delivery systems whether it be
Spotify FM in da B countries to do a
radio I listen to the internet radio
bluetooth is to high-resolution auxilary
inputs so that one can listen to the
best possible music available today and
you can access and use this product
completely without the use of an
external app or remote control so that
if you listen your music and you want to
make a phone call your phone's not going
to be occupied by playing the music for
you that said we do provide an app we
think may be one of the best music
playing apps on the market that allows
you to control many of these products
around your home so that if you'd like
to think the music together all over
your house for a party or something it's
rather easy to do with this
the idea here was to make something that
person and always sounds very very good
we built this like a true high fly by
starting by taking a very robust box
wooden box building a floor layer voice
coil woofer and a dome tweeter the way
you would build any real hi-5 product
and the box needs to be robust because
we have a 60 watt RMS amplifier to get
true high fidelity sound and an
impressive amount of output solo was is
intended to be the benchmark for the
minimum amount of space and hardware
necessary to deliver a roomful and
amount of sound that said should someone
have a rather large room park rather
demanding output needs we've designed
Duetto the wet though does exactly what
solo does except does more others it has
more speakers and has a greater output
so for a large room for very demanding
listening levels Duetto is the product
that we think people will like and we
also have a hard remote control that we
provide with the product so that if
you're sitting across the room and you
simply want to turn down the volume or
change stations you don't even have to
walk back to the product itself to do it
so if you're a music lover who would
like a really great sound like to have
all the content available to you today
and have it at the touch of your fingers
without using a device or an app solo
and duet so are the products for you
hey neighbor just wanted to drop by
did you date sir 59 Richard on watch a
traditional the world that just does you
in control so like what we here
turn it down what I hear more panawe our
models are born or not is a solid and
patent-pending design that evolves
around the concept of a revolutionary
volume adjustment wisdom with step one
you can hear everything crystal clear at
full volume
step two is perfect for lightly noisy
environment step 3
has a state-of-the-art acoustic music
filter with step ball you can totally
isolate yourself from your environment
hearing damage is irreversible not take
care of your is not as developed by a
young started coming base in Amsterdam
two of them Gwen &amp;amp; Quincy already have a
successful ear protection company called
Thunder plug which is sold in a whopping
26 countries worldwide three other
creative masterminds are Arjun and
Richard who adds cutting-edge innovation
and design into the mill together they
form the creative backbone of not an
analog adjustable hearing solution that
is adaptable to every situation from
concert to exam from flexible to
construction work not will be available
in various colors and trims to perfectly
suit your own style not control your
volume the average office
praise for work and creations but in
recent years a new hazardous phenomenon
has arisen it is known as the scream
slouch this is a screen scratcher
look at him slouching in front of a
screen yeah in the email screen sloucher
flouting in front of a much smaller
screen the slouching makes her
appearance less confident a back ache
every day for 8 to 12 hours
slouching in an inherent part of the
often habitat
it is upright girl
a small wearable that helps the slouches
become upright it is the simplest way to
improve your posture just stick it on
your back and press the button let it
upright would vibrate every time Crouch
look at the effect it has on the screens
croucher such a smile it not been seen
on their faces for a long time and
upright ghost its directly on the back
it is the only device that truly linked
in the back it's also the only pastor
trainer that works no matter what you're
doing sitting standing or walking oh
look one of the screen flowers has
discovered that if you press the button
once more a bright girl switches to
tracking mode a mode that doesn't
vibrate when you slouch but still keeps
all your daily posture data in the
upright app incredible to conclude our
research we returned to the office two
weeks later the results were astonishing
after two weeks being upright became
second nature
here is one sloucher 2 weeks ago and
here he is now see how much more
confident and better-looking he appears
notice also how he doesn't
from back pain oh we're in luck
it seems Emil agriculture finally feels
confident enough to approach the female
exclosure
exciting so if you two wish to stop
being a screens croucher get up right
girl
incredible how in only two week oh dear

name is a dead coin co-op right when we
started up right three years ago we were
just three founders with a mission to
help people correct their posture and
prevent back pain thanks man
operated ship thousands of units of our
professional product to have the users
our team grew to twenty engineers
designers and marketers but our mission
haven't changed we want to help more
people have better posture that is why

version the upright goal

back support us and get up right go I
promise you'll love it
