beer is pretty awesome and we all know
that beer tastes best fresh in the tap
with the perfect amount of carbonation
and texture but in order to reach the
masses beer is sold in cans and bottles
worldwide and unfortunately for us beer
lovers it just doesn't taste as good as
it does fresh from the tap until now
introducing wait tap wait tab has been
developed to deliver that fresh from the
tap experience no matter where you are
whether you're at the barbecue dinner
party sporting event or camping trip or
wherever you enjoy beer wait app
delivers the best possible beer drinking
experience with our patented visit
technology when you pull the tap handle
forward the beer is poured under
pressure to maintain the carbonation in
the body of the beer and when you push
the handle backwards the beer passes
through our sonic oscillator which
creates an ideal density film that
provides a rich smooth full-body texture
of an authentic draft beer we don't use
any gas chemicals are added it just
thoughtful science and a passion for
making beer tastes the way the
brewmasters intended last year we
introduced our first generation product
to the market through crowdfunding and
the response was overwhelming not only
we found an audience for our product but
we also found a community of people who
are really passionate about beer the
same way we are since then we built a
small team and have been all over the
country meeting which factors customers
and brewers hearing directly from them
about how much and why they love physics
with our new way tap draft beer system
we set out to build a more portable and
affordable design so beer lovers and
beer novices alike can enjoy the flavor
and taste of authentic draft beer at
home or anywhere we're coming back to
the crowdfunded community with our new
product because we want to put it in the
hands of beer lovers who are the most
passionate at the end of the day where
people just like you who love beer in
the community around it well thank you
for your support Cheers
you
I was afraid I was petrified okay we
invented a new kind of guitar that
people can learn to play in a matter of
minutes only around ten percent of the
population plays musical instrument but
eighty percent wishes they could I would
love to be able to play the guitar if
you don't you know have all the time in
the world is extremely hard to learn our
guitar has strings for strumming and
finger picking just like a traditional
guitar but instead of strings going up
the fretboard we have buttons all you
have to do is use a single touch to play
entire corpse our mobile app can display
the song for you with the lyrics and the
cord numbers so you get started playing
right away we set up a day and we
invited a whole bunch of people who wish
they could play the guitar to try our
product I was introduced to yeah maybe
45 minutes ago so we'll see how this
goes
I
Oh
so again
down
Oh
Oh
this is the most amazing thing I've ever
seen it's kind of surreal that it sounds
like that like I'm doing that I feel
really happy that I was able to learn
this so quickly I'd love to have one of
these our vision is to see a lot more
people sitting playing and making music
together
the guitar has a built-in speaker so you
can just grab it and go play anywhere or
you can even turn the speaker down and
play through your headphones you're not
disturbing anyone there's a lot that
goes into designing manufacturing at
shipping a great musical instrument and
our entire team of engineers and
musicians are working super hard to
bring you a great product if you ever
wish that you could be musically
expressive right away with this
instrument now you can please back us
heading out to tackle the world phone
wallet cool car and the nice umbrella
with an automatic open and close buttons
where the forecast reminder and the
field in anti loss function introducing
the hairs umbrella no more fuss normal
mess just the push of a single button to
fully open or closed no more struggle
after a rainy day and the best part
you'll never lose your umbrella ever
again with embedded Bluetooth technology
you'll be notified by your cell phone if
you forget your umbrella so never lose
it again
with an intelligent weather forecast
reminder the f remind you if this rain
high UV or even more treat the heads
umbrella you'll never get wet
you
you
this is the light pulse cable what makes
our product stand out is our patented
visible current technology in our
charging and data cables you're watching
real time the electric current powering
up your device as your device charges to
its full capacity the current will slow
down and the light will shut off your
battery reaches a hundred percent the
idea for the light pulse cable was born
when we discovered a new technology that
allows you to visually see the rate at
which your device charges our team at
pilot electronics ran with the idea and
we went from merely a concept to
developing a final product in a matter
of months our initial line of products
was well received by our consumers but
as we're always looking to improve we
asked her community for feedback from
this experience one of our common
feedbacks was to create a longer cable
and one that works with your gaming
consoles whether you're playing on your
ps4 or Xbox on your phone charging by
your bedside on your mobile device in
the car then you electroluminescent
cable allows for more can be used
the light pulse cables are almost ready
to be in your hands we just need one
final push from the Kickstarter
community to keep manufacturing costs
down and in turn offer these to you at a
great price we're very excited about
this product and hope you guys can help
us make it a reality thank you for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
