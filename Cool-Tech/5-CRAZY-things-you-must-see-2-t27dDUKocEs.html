have to carry stuff I want to be able to
remember moments like these forever
that's why the MySite 360 is the perfect
solution the MySite 360 can capture
everything in beautiful 4k without
needing a big rig or heavy equipment to
get stable shots and if the trail gets
bumpy or the camera isn't in the right
position the MySite 360 keeps videos
level with its built-in calibration the
horizon optimization ensures level
viewing and to make sure your viewing
quality isn't sacrificed by unexpected
camera positioning or tilting the stable
calibration minimizes motion gimbal Lake
quality without the excess weight and
equipment and it's water resistant so
the MySite 360 can capture the entire
experience rain or shine plus if you
need to change the position it only
takes a second
when i get to a place with a great view
i know that the my site 360 is getting
the best quality photos and videos if i
missed anything on my way here the my
site 360 has a long battery life so i
won't miss it on my way back
on my way back I can start posting right
away the my site 360 app uses artificial
intelligence to create a feature called
life log which looks at all the videos
from my hike and stitches the best parts
of them together into one clip that way
I don't have to go through hours of
footage hi Angie funga off my test
resist my side 316 is not a fully
360-degree camera if what you want is to
make a true tricity degree video you may
want to look somewhere else but what we
are hopefully is the wearable camera
decide for Kiker to capture and be
creating spirits we have no intention of
making the best 360-degree camera out
there but I can confidently say that if
you are hiker who want to create your
hiking experience my ethnicity is a
product for you thank you
measuring tapes help us measure
distances and the dimensions of
different objects but a measuring tape
doesn't work in every situation why
isn't there a single tool that lets us
measure everything now there is
introducing bagel the smart tape measure
bagel lets you measure just about
anything at home and at work bagel has
three different modes string mode wheel
mode and remote my string mode is great
for measuring straight lines curves and
around corners wheel mode lets you
measure irregular or odd shaped objects
and it also makes taking measurements
with one hand much easier remote mode
lets you measure objects that are far
away and out of your reach after you're
done measuring you'll need a way to
record your measurements using pen and
paper can be a real hassle with bagel
you can quickly and easily save your
measurements with voice descriptions
just take your measurement push the save
button and then tag a voice memo to it
dog the future later when you're done
vengo will send your measurements to
bagels mobile app via bluetooth this
mobile application lets you review your
saved measurements and share them with
your friends bagel is precise it uses
our patented technology to make sure you
always get an accurate measurement also
bagel has an easy-to-read digital
display that's viewable in most lighting
condition
in the past few years also some
measuring devices have become smarter
and made our lives easier it's not
scales smart thermometers and even
smartwatches but when it comes to
measuring size we still use a tape
measure which is more than a century old
why don't innovate the way we measure
size so we created bagel a smart tape
measure we put a lot of effort into
creating bagel our team work night and
day to make the best quality product
with this pandemic design we have our
final prototype that is ready for mass
production now we need your help to
deliver this amazing product to everyone
please help us bring this bagel to life
thank
matters
I'm just so known a nutshell what is
this all about so what's so special
about it yeah everything look at it it's
gorgeous
how do you use it first time you open it
well how do you have you turn it on and
get the music going so simple to connect
you just literally twist it it's the
only moving function on the actual
device twist it select whether you want
wine in or bluetooth pairing up to your
phone and then you're going to get
exploring you'll find the best surface
that you want for you the best surface
for the type of music you're listening
to if you place on the back of a window
and you'll hear sound through both sides
bigger the surface you're placing it on
as well the bigger the sound you're
going to recreate
this isn't just a speaker that you're
going to take home and put on the side
and think it sounds great you're going
to show people that love so the other
feature we've got that's inside there as
well I think it's really quite neat so
if you were at a space like this you
could place two speakers either side
you've got the stereo sound coming out
of it makes it amazing
we've done things really differently I
think for this campaign we want people
to be able to get hold of this product
quickly we've got 5,000 of the sizer our
products there it's done you want this
by Christmas get it signed up before
december the tenth and will ship the ear
for christmas
Oh
Oh
we're Deimos and we've made the best
shovel ever other shovels crack bend and
break demos beats them all literally
last year we launched our kicker tool
the stealth shovel on Kickstarter people
loved it but they all agreed on one
thing they wanted something bigger
badder and made for everyone so we
listened and gathered our team to make
the bestest toughest damn this shovel
ever and we did introducing the Alpha
shovel mother nature meet daddy you
wanted big oh it's big over 20 inches
long and 12 inches deep of glorious
aircraft grade aluminum means you can
shovel away the ice age or your driveway
it's got serrated teeth to cut ice and
shovel gliders to protect your deck
beneath so when we say it's cutting edge
we mean it valve the shovel is durable
and tough rain or shine dirt or snow he
built it to whether through a lifetime
of storms in a storm through any weather
our collapsible shaft makes it easy to
pack and the built-in strap holders
makes it easy to carry and we added a
saw for good luck use it to cut anything
that might get in the way choose between
a d handle for better grip or a t-handle
for better compatibility best of all
everything in the Alpha shovel is
interchangeable with the rest of the
demo's family allowing you to build a
collection of multi-purpose tools for
life every job every day for everyone
the Alpha shovel conditions be damned
Deimos is a collective of lifelong
innovators and adventures we like to go
out and wreck face with nature and come
back to make the best products ever
we're born and raised in Jackson Hole
but our family goes far beyond town and
state borders this is a collaborative
effort not just between the team but
with pro athletes action enthusiasts and
most importantly our community back our
campaign today and join the demo's
collective we thank you for all of your
support truly deimos defined not by us
but by you our backers let's keep
crushing it
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
