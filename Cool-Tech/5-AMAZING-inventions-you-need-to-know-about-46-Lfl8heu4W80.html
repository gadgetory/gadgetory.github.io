but while the goal is to lose our
inhibitions most of us end up losing our
stuff instead the more technology
evolves the more gadgets we buy and the
dream of travel can be replaced by a
nightmare we had enough of those
panic-stricken moments what if we could
prevent disaster before it happens this
is the reality of the Mutai
a smart rechargeable tag that notifies
you immediately if you forget something
got an upcoming calendar notification
like a flight where you'll need to
remember a long list of stuff you'll be
reminded just in time ensuring you never
miss a beat just open the app name the
item and stick it on focus on your trip
while your mute egg takes care of the
rest
this smart learning tech gets to know
you and your habits when you use your
stuff notifying you accordingly
depending on your location you can
adjust the range
no matter what phase of your journey
your rats the new tag has your back
every step of the way the only thing you
need to worry about is whether you're
brave enough to tackle that bungee jump
roller coaster and wherever Adventures
calling you to with the new tag you can
check in your tagged items in just a few
clicks Travel should be simple not more
stressful than a day at the office
once you've touched down and need to
collect your luggage you will never have
to fight your way through a mob of
passengers ever again just turnout and
when it arrives on the belts you'll know
through an instant notification when
it's ready for collection no more
searching and no more stress
heading home can't find your car the tag
will navigate you to your vehicle
hassle-free the past year has been a
roller coaster of our own developing and
perfecting the mutex potential our team
has made it possible and we couldn't be
more excited to have partnered with the
top manufacturing names in the business
this next generation is as flexible and
uniquely modular we're ready to bring
the mutex to you but we need your help
to cover our growing manufacturing costs
and overheads we need funding to turn
our dream into your reality we're
dreamers creating world of stress free
travelers and hassle free James oh the
places you'll go
let's fun tomorrow today together will
you walk with us hey I'm Ethan and this
is our new Alfa Adventure Travel Pack
there are a ton of cool features built
into this step so let's dive in and take
a closer look to start we've taken the
stress out of checking luggage with a 35
liter size that meets Airlines carry-on
standards from there we added a blend of
tough TPU coated 1000d polyester with
durable 1680 D ballistic nylon panel a
low profile harness was then adopted
from our backpacking packs which helps
distribute the load while you're out
getting off the grid this system
includes contoured shoulder straps for
comfort and balance a padded hip belt to
support the load a breathable air mesh
back panel and an adjustable sternum
strap in terms of storage the Alpha is
loaded with compartments that let you
decide how to pack and organize all of
your gear there's a suitcase style full
wrap zipper opening on the main
compartment that opens into a large
zippered mesh compartment on the right
side and a subdivided zippered mesh
compartment on the left
two zippered pockets round out the top
moving to the outside of the pack you're
able to access the padded laptop and
tablet sleeves with the right side
zipper on the left side there's a short
cut zipper that provides access to the
main internal compartment without having
to take the pack off your back the
compartment on the top is designed with
passports and other small essentials in
mind which is subdivided for added
organization for added security all
external zippers feature our theft proof
webbing sewn across the openings we also
added lash loops on the hip belt and
throughout the pack giving you the
option to lock the pack to fix points a
slotted back panel houses the shoulder
straps and hip belt ensuring loose ends
are a non-issue in overhead bins on the
bus or in the trumpet cars additionally
for reinforced grab handles provide
multiple carry points when the shoulder
straps are tucked away
there's even a high visibility rain
cover that packs down within that as
part of the Alpha system we've also
designed the main pack to pair with our
stove of the toc day pack which easily
deploys for day hikes and trips to the
market once you've arrived at your
destination
accessories are also offered including
mesh laundry bags a nylon shoe bag and a
snap-on mesh water bottle sleeve that
let you further customize your travel
plan we've always wanted a system that
promotes nimble comfortable travel and
now we have that with the Alpha
interesting
let's just hook up to any guitar
it's so loud it's like like you can
plate like you're like a one-man band
that was that because of my practice
sampling all my pals and stuff the amp
ten times as big and doesn't sound
nearly as good
I love that I can just tune it right on
the spot here and then when I want to I
can just pick up and go all right thanks
man in the past we saw the rise of the
typical electric guitar amplifier there
big loud and push a lot of air but
frankly come with some pretty serious
limitations amps just refused to move on
introducing the jam stack the world's
first attachable guitar amplifier and
the most versatile way to play the
electric guitar traditional amps take a
long time to set up this can kill not
only your motivation but your
inspiration as well unless you've got
the space to lead or gear setup getting
going with a fax can be a pretty big
pain in the butt the jam stack attaches
in seconds
Hey
mmm
say you have space to always leader here
set up do we
most of us live in places where jamming
at full volume is just too loud but when
you turn down traditional amps even a
little it makes them sound choked and
frankly pretty crappy also amps can do
very little out of the box you need
several hundred dollars of pedals to
really take advantage of that massive
speaker with a jam stack you can easily
access cool effects like delays loops or
Distortion
all powered by any smartphone
okay let's say you want to get mobile
and head out into the world well that's
going to be difficult when you take into
account your amps wires pedals and
guitar that's a lot to carry for one
person the jam stack packs up easily and
can fit in your jacket pocket and even
your guitar kicks even cheat practice
amps are heavy and a real pain to bring
anywhere the jam stack gives you the
freedom to play anywhere with your
traditional amp you're going to need to
find some power so what about portable
amps you ask these amps sound terrible
at any volume don't allow you to use a
fax and still don't give you the same
level of freedom as an acoustic guitar
player enjoys
you see you have to compromise with
current solutions
you either have sound quality or
portability but not both
that's why we created a brand new way to
play the electric guitar one with no
compromises and unlimited potential the
jam stack attaches to the base of any
electric guitar body uses any smartphone
for effects and allows you to bring
shockingly rich down anywhere you want
no limitations and effects and recording
no limitations and where and when you
play just pure enjoyment wait what if I
just want to play music to my smartphone
it also functions as an ultra premium
bluetooth speaker so feel free to snap
it off and set it down to entertain your
friends not good far this is quite work
the jam stack is durable and designed to
be taken anywhere it allows your 8 hours
on a single charge and is gentle on your
guitar
we've already funded our design and are
working hard with reputable industrial
design firm and manufacturing so ask
yourself why go to the trouble to haul
your entire rig with it when it could be
this easy why spend this much money when
all you need is this
[Laughter]
why settle for poor sound quality when
the gym stack sounds like this
help us make the jam stacker reality
thank you
