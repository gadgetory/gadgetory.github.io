time in the bathroom we try many
different ways to achieve it but none of
them solves the problem effectively some
are too weak to disguise the odor and
evaporate very quickly others are
ineffective since there are only used
after the damage is already done but the
real problem is that we have to remember
to use it every single time for it to
take effect and that never really lasts
we just stop using it after a while
we offer a new approach one that doesn't
rely on proactive collaboration that
automatically gives you the comfort you
seek we call it nutria nutria hangs on
your toilet and is self activated as you
sit once activated nutria sprays
biodegradable compounds into the toilet
water creating an impenetrable barrier
that traps the odor inside preventing it
from spreading nutria is completely
autonomous it requires no batteries nor
any maintenance with effective action
for 250 uses it's minimalist design
perfectly blends with the environment
and fits any toilet and easily slides
off when cleaning the toilet nutria
changes your entire bathroom experience
it gives you the freedom to walk into
the bathroom without waiting for it to
air out to never worry again about what
you leave behind to have a carefree time
in the bathroom with various fragrances
that make you forget where you are with
your health will be able to launch
nutria on a global scale and provide
everyone with the opportunity for a
whole new bathroom experience
mr. beams motion sensor LED stick
anywhere life is a perfect solution for
lighting up your path at night without
waking others they're better than
traditional night lights because they
don't require an outlet and they're only
on when they detect motion they come in
three packs in six packs so you don't
have to choose just one location they
have a bright LED that never needs
replacing gives you 10 lumens and lights
up about 20 square feet a motion sensor
to detect you at up to 15 feet away a
light sensor to prevent them from going
on when there's enough ambient light
there's an auto shutoff that will turn
it off automatically and conserve
battery life you should get about a year
of life out of one set of double-a
batteries but maybe the best thing about
the mr. beams motion sensor LED stick
anywhere light is like all other mr.
beams lights it can attach anywhere in
minutes without an electrician first
look the light over you'll see the
mounting plate is on the back slide that
down and pull it off we'll need that
later but for now I like to take a coin
and loosen the two thumb screws on the
back of the light once you get to a
certain point you can turn them with
your finger
and flip it over and you'll see there
are places for for double-a batteries
take the flat part of the battery put it
where the spring is while four batteries
need to be alkaline or you won't get
good performance out of this light now
take the battery door up match the two
tabs up insert screw number one your
finger as far as I'll go
number two turn clockwise use a coin if
it's not collaborating now your light is
ready for installation to install your
mr. bean stick anywhere light first take
the bracket which removed when we put
the batteries in the light and take a
piece of masking tape and just run it
along the front of it the front side is
where the nubs are sticking out we're
gonna use this to hold the bracket to
the wall alright first I'm going to take
a nail and a hammer to make our pilot
holes for the screws you can always use
a drill but this is a much easier way to
do it so make your pilot hole and take
the included screws and a Philips head
screwdriver and just drive the screws in
one by one
now that the screws are in remove to
match me to take your light on the back
you'll see two keyholes that's what
you're going to mount to the two nubs
that are sticking out of the bracket so
simply align them and slide them down
your lights installed and ready to go
the mr. beams stick anywhere lights give
you just enough light so you can safely
navigate around your home in the dark
they're perfect for steps and hallways
especially if you have guests or
children in the house watch it in action
do you know who I am I'm a powerhouse of
sound and Wi-Fi wrapped in beauty and
innovation
I'm smart enough to let you play your
music hands-free Alexa play my weekend
lay list while I gracefully extend the
Wi-Fi in your home which means no more
dead zones
no more buffering with beautiful room
filling sound I'm a premium combination
of smart speaker and Wi-Fi mesh system
that pairs perfectly with or be because
I'm or be voice from Netgear and there's
nothing like me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
