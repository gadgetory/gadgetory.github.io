surprises or the everyday experiences

our lives we won't always have the time
to take out our phone to record these
fleeting moments of happiness wouldn't
it be great to capture and keep these
memories instead of simply watching them
pass by this is what we invented the
mocha cam
snap-snap is the world's smallest 4k
camera and unlike any current action
camera snap is small enough to wear
comfortably and it's elegant design is a
fit with any fashion statement the
innovative 180 degree flip lens allows
you to shoot from the best angles and
enables so many creative possibilities
it may not always be easy to find the
button when you wear a camera but with
snap you can turn it on and start
filming with just a click of the remote
the snap battery life allows for one and
a half hours of continuous video
recording which is impressive for a
camera of its tiny size
what's more the video can be uploaded to
the cloud via the Wi-Fi connection so
you can share the story of your life
with friends and family anywhere
immediately with the magnet clip quarter
inch adapter or waterproof case you'll
have numerous ways to wear it and

relaxation is hard to achieve

hi Jason
reader of vital today video cameras have
amazing sensors soon as user stock movie
video becomes shaky and not fun to watch
in order to capture stable video you
need expensive and complex secret acid
creator in drones and camera gimbal with
background commercial photography I knew
I could go in camera that can simplify
the process I want a camera that small
and flexible requires no setup and
allowed and you want to shoot pro level
video so I created I don't care
I don't care miss the first pocket-sized
camera that can do it all you are always
one click away from capturing stunning
videos the integrated 3 axis gimbal and
4k resolutions ensures your precious
moment go from shaky to smooth
with the interchangeable lens system

of action cameras close-up lenses of
DSLR cameras eliminating the needs of
bring multiple cameras while most camera
Matt lighting options with vital cam

little places with its beauty and
spotlight our year is selfie fanatic
with the ability to change the lens
angle and long of selfie touchscreens
and also an app for preview and control
the aim of the camera up to a hundred
feet away selfies are no longer bound by
the length of your arms no idea take
turns to take good photos if you are

and exciting moments and stable and
cinematic videos that you will be proud

many of today's memorable videos are
capturing complex camera setups I
require teams of specialists to operate
the vital cam selfie states all you need
to mimic many of the blockbuster camera
movements for the perfectionist users if
for facts is suspension arm will further
reduce the vertical motions that dewey
axis gimbal cannot compensate produced
through flying motions comparable to
drums and steadicams furthermore users
can switch off the gimbal and use idle
cam as a regular camera it also features
a connector for drones and remote
control and a might input for high
quality audio finally time-lapse no
longer require the purchase of a
motorized head hyperlapse not eating a
tripod for me possible due to the
amazing stability of idle cam so whether

perfect on-the-go solution for a
beginner needing a device in country or
and daily life in movie fashion idle cam
