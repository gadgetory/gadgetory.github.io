and creator of the sad camp in 2009 my
family and I hit the road and covered
58,000 miles all across North America
over three years I was traveling with my
wife and two daughters and we weren't
satisfied with the comfort of a
traditional tent or the time to pitch it
we settled on a pop-up trailer but it
was a drag and a pain to set up after
going back home I found it I camper and
after many tests prototypes and
improvement on our previous three models
my team and I are proud to have found
the answer introducing the sky camp the
world's first expandable hard shell
rooftop tent as featured in tech insider
the Sunday Times Lonely Planet insider
design G gadgets Mashable Asia and
Business Insider the sky camp is truly
exceptional it is a treehouse dream come
true except that it is bigger mobile and
more comfortable it is made for life on
the road so you can take off whenever
stop wherever and fall asleep looking up
at the stars the sky camp is of the
highest quality so you can keep camping
in your rooftop tent night after night
waterproof tent fabric a
fiber-reinforced hard shell top aluminum
or stainless steel metal components to
prevent rust we did not sacrifice
quality for price the sky camp is
perfect for a family trip for a road
trip with friends it can fit two adults
and two children or three adults the
extension floor folds out to reveal a
comfortable king-sized mattress made of
high density memory foam pillows and
bedding can conveniently be left inside
the tent when you close it worried about
weight I camper take safety seriously
the floor is made of aluminum honeycomb
panels that are extremely strong and can
hold up to 900 pounds the sky camp
weighs only 150 pounds including the
ladder and mattress so two people can
easily mount it within a few minutes
it's universal mounting system and
lightweight make it compatible
most cross bars or roof racks we know
how difficult and annoying it can be to
pitch a tent open a pop-up trailer or
soft top roof tent only to have to pack
it up the next morning day after day the
sky camp can be set up easily in less
than a minute one person can open it on
his or her own and closing it is just as
simple you love your car and we wanted
it to look just as good with a rooftop
tent mounted on it the sky camps fiber
reinforced hard shell is aerodynamic
lightweight and available in glossy
black or white want more customize your
sky camp by adding an awning to protect
you from the rain or Sun an annex room
to hang out in or store gear a rack to
keep your shoes dry and away from bugs
and animals hanging storage shelves or a
wind deflector the sky camp is my dream
come true and now I want to share it
with you embark on your own journey and
follow your dreams back this project and
help travelers around the world grow
closer to people and nature
mmmm
ok
e
and
you
you
Oh
every once in a while a revolutionary
product comes along that changes
everything I'd like you to meet the
bubble here a problem the market that I
saw was that spherical technology was
only being used for the mapping you can
probably use it for some other things
like panoramic photos and filmmaking
interactive videos which side of the
pond ourselves to make something special
the bubble cam doesn't just capture
photos or videos but also streams live
videos we want to make this technology
affordable small sort portable and
available to everything people are
accustomed to shooting panoramas with
their mobile phone there's a problem
with that it's inherently at a sync with
the bubble can you press the button once
and boom you've got your photos your
video and you pop it in our software you
can look all around it's amazing we've
designed the camera in a tetrahedral
orientation Center there no blind spots
because each camera overlaps the joining
camera no other camera that we've seen
on the market is able to handle that as
well as put it in a form factor that's
the size of a baseball that's light
portable and easy to move around a few
in any environment that you want to
record with bubbles patent-pending
tetrahedral design you'll get 14
megapixel photos h.264 video capturing
1080p at 15 frames per second in 720p at
30 frames per second wife I live
streaming a microSD slot and USB stream
I really think people are going to want
to buy the bubble camera just because of
the ability to shoot in many different
directions the fact is it takes in all
views in real time whether it be
security and surveillance action sports
gaming real estate teleconferencing I
really do think the opportunities are
endless with bubbles SDK an API our goal
is to allow people to experiment and
explore with this new technology we've
seen it used in music videos before with
the black eye peas back we've seen the
commercial used for ikea and budweiser
one
most exciting things that I'm looking
forward to seeing how filmmakers are
going to be using 360 video it's a whole
new way to shoot things and create
interactive experiences and a new way of
telling story body-mind change is a
co-production between tip and the CSP
media lab we can start to figure out
what we can do it and I'm really excited
about the insulation work the video work
the interactive work is that you can do
a technology like this we've designed a
bubble chem to be ready and available to
everyone you're gonna have to make a
choice sometimes you want that straight
on shot that one angle but they're going
to be moments where you want to see
everything with your help we're going to
make 360 degrees of your world available
at any time
hi I'm Jessica bank I'm a scientist
roboticist and founder of rock paper
robot design and engineering from out of
Brooklyn we make kinetic furniture
what's kinetic furniture well basically
the core that moves like these
levitating table or this bouncing one or
I lay this alley chair inspired by our
experience living and working in New
York see this is our office but this is
our awesome the city inspires us informs
us and acts as a constant reminder of
the diversity of people and problems
that we have to consider when we design
plus the responsibility we feel to not
create more come see what we mean
the ali sher retract the two inches so
it's ideal for small spaces it's flat
packs for transport and we all know how
important that is it's lightweight so
it's easy to move around Alighieri the
built-in lumbar support so in q4 dummy
after a long day on your piece
and because the chair body is made out
of aluminum and the default amber is
made out of seat it's great outdoor
environment and because we're fans of
personal expression ollie is
customizable the camber the flexible
flatted feet part is interchangeable so
you can swap it out to suit your style
and just for our kickstarter backers
we're offering some limited edition
finishes for your chairs including an
awesome silkscreen by our talented
friend liz be no extra space no problem
stir your Ollie chair on the ball like a
work of art and of course the chair is
perfect for home to all we can be your
primary seating or accommodate your
space for extra guys so storing the
chair might seem like sleight of hand
manufacturing it doesn't take magic it
takes money that's where you come in by
supporting our Kickstarter campaign
you'll be the first to get your butts on
the ollie chairs but far lower than the
expected retail price and you'll be
supporting a female run manufacturing
company that's cool manufacturing so
thank you from all of us at rock paper
robot support Ollie and let all our
support you and don't forget to share
the chair cowboy here d allah khair get
yourself to kick starter motor
Oh
you
you
