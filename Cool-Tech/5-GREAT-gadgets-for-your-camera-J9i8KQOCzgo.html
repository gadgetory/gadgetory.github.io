you
you
Oh
you
in the 19th century the vast majority of
photos were shot with the now legendary
pets while lens Photoshop with a pets
father immediately recognizable for
their super sharp centers and wonderful
swirly bokeh affecting the backgrounds
the distinctive look of these photos is
near impossible to achieve using
Photoshop sand filters for this
Kickstarter project we are reinventing
the pets fur lens for 21st century
photographers it doesn't matter whether
you shoot analog or digital the
brand-new lomography pets while portrait
lens is designed to work with both canon
EF and Mick on f mount cameras so why
are we bringing the lens back two
centuries after it was first created
well the original petzval lens was
designed in order to work with cameras
manufactured in the 19th century it's
extremely hard to find a pet spa lens
today which works well with smaller
format cameras and produces the same
unique effect and the petzval lenses you
do find usually defective because of
their age that's why we set ourselves
the exciting challenge to produce a
brand new pets fur lens with 21st
century the lenses are crafted from
brass just like the original pets by a
lens was and they look amazing when
connected to your SLR camera each lens
is produced in Russia by ZENIT's a
company steeped in tradition and famed
for their skill in developing high
quality optical equipment the team at
Zenit has redrawn recalculated and
Ramesh's the original 1840 pets our lens
to make it work with a whole host of
modern cameras in reinventing the pets
file we have had to re-engineer the
optics of the original lens and make
them work with modern SLR cameras while
still retaining the effects that have
made the original pets of our fingers to
give some background to the pets our
story when the first analog camera was
introduced in 1839 it used a lens
designed by Charles Chevalier
chevaliers lens was hugely important but
it did have some problems it had a slow
small aperture of f15 this meant that
even in bright sunlight exposures could
take ten minutes or even more Josie
petzval was a professor of mathematics
at the University of Vienna and just one
year after Chevalier produced his lens
in 1840 petrol created arrival lens
design in contrast to the slow
performance of the Chevalier lens pets
Val's design allowed for a much faster
speed at F 3.6 the original petzval lens
was a truly revolutionary invention the
speed and performance of pets paws
design was especially well suited for
portrait shooting and helped give birth
to commercial photography as we know it
we already have a first working sample
of the new pets by lens and are very
excited by the results but we need your
support to take project further by
backing us you'll help finalize the lens
design and fund the first production of
new lenses in Russia together we can
bring back the fantastic lens optic for
a whole new generation of photographers
and film ace
you
hi kickstarter i'm oliver and i'm
richard we are the creators of eiffel o
a portable dolly for professional and
amateur needs we quickly realized there
was a lot of professional equipment
accessories that had not yet been made
accessible to the public limiting video
possibilities up until now mostly all
accessories were too heavy and bulky
restricting filming and making long
shots impossible for any spontaneous or
solo filmmaking I flow opens up a whole
new range of video possibilities for any
kind of filmmaker Eiffel stabilizes
camera movements enabling a fluid
professional quality shot no matter
where you're filming lightweight
powerful and easy to use the I flow is
designed for compact cameras SLR cameras
and smartphones so when it's time to
film simply attach your smartphone or
any other device swing up to two pounds
and latch I flow to any flat surface
around you it's that simple made with
premium reinforced plastic materials the
Eiffel is less than eight inches long
and weighs less than 1 pound it's soft
polyurethane wheels add smoothness to
your movements and absorbs any
vibrations created by the surface the I
flow can be used both horizontally and
vertically of even inclined perspective
bring I flow anywhere and everywhere and
I flow will bring your video to higher
levels
it's heavy duty clamp structure
surrounds the surface and stabilizes the
dolly as a set of two springs secures
the I flow tightly to any surface
ranging from one quarter inch to two
inches wide need a wider angle you
simply have to pull the wheels and
change the angle to the wide surface
position if you prefer to use I flow on
a flat surface open the clamp system to
its maximum and the lock system will
automatically keep I flow in position
our design is not complete the prototype
is tested and ready for production all
we need is your help for the injection
mold making this new product available
to the market
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
