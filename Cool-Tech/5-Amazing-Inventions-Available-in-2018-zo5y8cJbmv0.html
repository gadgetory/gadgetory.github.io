teeth can you imagine doing the same
with them it's a dreadful experience for
both us and for them humane max I'm
sorry now I'll focus only on dogs did
you know that 84% of us already have
oral health issues by the age of three
it's like the number one problem for us
dogs that bites I have two toys but they
don't clean my teeth and what's with
these treats I mean they taste good but
do you really expect food to clean food
just beef jerky brush your teeth because
the my bad breath I can't talk to
friends freely so I locked myself at
home for days man is dog's best friend
and I'm sure they'll find our way
introducing bristly the revolutionary
brushing stick for dogs
it has paw pads cleverly designed for
easy holding with the toothpaste
reservoir and bristle line grooves
bristly perfectly matches a dog's
behavior and Anatomy
hey I'm Petros the inventor of bristly
when I lost my childhood dog Mickey due
to oral disease it was devastating but
that inspired me to come up with a
solution to this crucial problem as
brushing remains the gold standard to
oral disease prevention i developed
bristly as a brushing stick to allow all
dogs to take care of their own oral
health the bristles help to clean teeth
down to the gum line preventing plaque
and tartar buildup in the last six
months over fifty thousand pet parents
have tried her first version and they
loved it their feedback has helped us
come up with a version that's best
suited to dogs needs please pack our
campaign and help us empower all dogs to
brush soon Monica will have more
Instagram followers than Kim and LeBron
Harry spends more time on his hobbies
now everybody wants to hang out with
Pina and Max he became a real heartthrob
backyard
hi I'm Troy and I invented the line
Betty the ultimate multi-tool for
fishermen my unique design allows you to
quickly and easily thread your fishing
rod the line buddy also features a
magnetic hook threader a knot tying tool
clippers and a line slicer this tool is
designed to get you fishing faster by
reducing time fussing with your line and
threading and tying hooks this is the
first mechanical tool that will thread
or rot it works great with fly rods bait
casting rods and even micro guide rods
with all their tiny guides what makes us
possible is the patent pending magnetic
needle and base design this magnetic
needle and base allows the needle to
detach from the tool in order to pass
through a guide the magnet then pulls
the needle back into its base after it
has exited the guide this design lets
you quickly move through all the rod
guides with the attached fishing line
let me show you how it works first make
a small loop in the end of your line and
pull it back under the attachment
mechanism on the needle then slide the
tool across the top of the guides the
guide adapter on the tool makes guiding
the needle through the eyelets of the
rod effortless once your fishing rod has
been threaded you are now ready to use
the hook threading tool this feature has
a small magnet that securely holds small
hooks and flies the channel directs your
line right into the eye of the hook once
the hook is threaded you can easily tie
knots with the knot tying tool use the
line Clipper to cut excess line there is
also a convenient two way line slicer
for quick line cuts
additionally the tip of the threading
needle can be used to clean glue and
muck from a hook I I also added a
removable clip so you can attach your
tool to a lanyard or strap the line
buddy comes with an instruction manual
that explains how to use all the
features of the tool I've also included
instructions on how to tie multiple
knots after more than a year and
development fine-tuning the design and
testing prototypes the line buddy is now
complete and ready to order the molds
are finished and the suppliers are ready
to manufacture the tool
I chose Kickstarter to introduce a line
buddy to fishermen around the world I am
excited to get my product out there and
into your hands once the Kickstarter
campaign ends
I will put in the first production order
I want to thank the Kickstarter
community for watching this video and
helping to back this project there's a
gazillion things on the market that say
they'll tune your guitar
I just tried this out and this thing
really really works this thing can get
death and get you right on money I'm a
fan a really cool little product I love
it can operate without the smartphone
but with the smartphone it's even more
intelligent I really love it I think
this is this is the stuff flying
concepts it's fantastic because I
actually played 12 string guitars you
know how bloody difficult it is to keep
a 12 string in tune this is come along
at the end of my career
thank you you will this device actually
Tunes the guitar for you of course not
just a demonstration but I have
obviously this is one of the first
things I've seen that is sort of
shockingly cool not only does it do what
it says it's supposed to do but offers
like crazy amount of new features that I
hadn't even actually thought of you're
gonna love it
America first but you know can we just
say rody tube seconds four years ago we
invented the award-winning roadie tuner
and helped tune more than 2 million
strings today we're proud to introduce
rody - and Rohde bass to use rhodium
just select your instrument place rody
on the peg and pluck
just like that you're in tune and ready
to play roadie 2 is the world's first
stand-alone automatic guitar tuner each
roadie comes pre-programmed with your
most-used alternate and open tunings
even in noisy environments roadies
built-in vibration detection allows you
to tune perfectly it makes getting in
tune faster and easier than ever before
and this makes roadie the most versatile
tool that you can put in your kit bag
for bass players roadie bass sports an
even stronger motor bigger battery and
special programming to let it handle low
frequencies it's not just a tuner the
optional mobile app can be used to
create custom tunings custom instruments
and dig into some cool advanced features
Brodie lets you keep track of your
instrument health wind your strings when
you're restringing and much more it's
like having a guitar tech in your pocket
really - and roadie bass can tune any of
your string instruments with guitar
machine head's seven and twelve string
guitars ukuleles mandolins banjos you
name it so no matter what you play or
how you play roadie will help you to
less and play more over the last four
years I've been searching for a way to
travel over short distances using
electric power I thought about a
skateboard but I was concerned it
wouldn't be stable enough rollerblades
seemed too complicated to put on and
take off and the gyropod design would be
too heavy to be carried out easily is it
right and accessible to everyone
the scooters seem like a good place to
start but one with 12-inch inflatable
wheels these brakes and an integrated
charger but that would be too heavy
it had to be light and comfortable so I
thought let's invent a whole new type of
brushless motor and let's use an
advanced aluminum alloy for the frame it
will be lighter and still just as strong
designed by Eliam studio knives now this
could be the one
hi I'm David Lieber and I'm proud to
present the electric moon it's an
electric 22 pound scooter able to cover
12 miles at a top speed of 16 miles per
hour it has an integrated charger rear
and front headlights and shows your
speed and travel distance on a digital
screen and it can be chopped in less
than one hour the electric mode uses a
new generation of brushless direct drive
engines based on an original
architecture the axial flux engine
integrated in the rear wheel has a state
are built with printed circuit boards
that make it light powerful and reliable
electric mode offers you freedom from
your daily commuting trips you can use
it for every mile from your home to your
train or from your train to your work
lightweight and equipped with inflatable
wheels and a simple clip you can fold it
easily carry it like a small suitcase
and store it anywhere
it's speed gives a real sensation of
freedom you can experience the thrill of
a fast-paced right in total safety while
saving precious time with a 12 mile
ranch you can skip the bus and enjoy a
pleasant ride in open air or more easily
finish the last mile of your journey
using the headlights you can safely
enjoy your night ride electric mode is
perfect for city trips I use it daily
and I never get tired of the feeling of
freedom from speeding around the city
even after more than a thousand miles on
the same prototype and the little trip
to Cambridge it's a clean silent and
enjoyable way to get around the city
would you like to be the next one to
take it for a spin
check our IndieGoGo page your friends
will help us start a first production
run and finally production tooling we
can't wait to share the electric mood
adventure with you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
