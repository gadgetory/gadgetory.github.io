you
I
you
we found the spare parts we need but
they're in the old city there's only 60
minutes to make the pickup but someone
has to run a corner well the solar
panels are down and if the wind stops
blowing we're back to the Stone Age
folks I'll do it lucky the stealth bikes
still half charged surely enough to give
you there just try not to break it if I
could
the battery should make it home if you
take it easy but don't be late am I
remember don't stop for anyone or
anything
come on there's one minute left come
here I gave them an hour 60 seconds
so you want to come join us you want to
get you high
gippy girl
I
you
you
hi I'm Nathan javis i'm the founder and
chief scientist at bolt motorbikes when
was the last time that you really look
forward to your commute across the city
I'm an inventor and so I set out to
solve a problem that my friends and I
faced every day and that's the getting
around the city sucks as a lifelong
motorcycle rider I wanted to create a
motorbike that I enjoyed riding but that
you didn't have to be an experienced
rider to enjoy today it's my pleasure to
introduce you to the m1 it's a smart
fully electric motor bike that's fun and
easy to ride like a bicycle you don't
need a license you don't need
registration and you don't need
insurance you've got enough power to
climb any Hill in the city keep up with
traffic and you can park them on the
sidewalk so you're parking and traffic
problems disappear the m1 is designed
for performance and a motorcycle like
experience but you can go to places on
an m1 that you just can't get to on a
motorcycle and you can go faster and
farther than any bicycle it's the
ultimate urban transporter
the m1 is City friendly and low
maintenance but if you want to unlock
some real fun just dial in sport mode
for offroad use and just like a bicycle
the m1 is fast and efficient and it's
totally green it's a great way to reduce
your carbon footprint but what I really
like about it it's a hell of a lot of
fun to ride
when a wheel spins all the way around
it's a complete revolution at Boalt
motorbikes we're imagining something
astonishing having fun every day getting
around the city but creating an electric
vehicle is a costly endeavor by
supporting our campaign you're helping
us bring these cool motorbikes to
production many thanks for believing in
us without you we wouldn't be where we
are today so thanks again you keep the
rubber side down
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
