we all live our lives on the go but in
today's world our phones tablets and
even watches require constant power you
could carry around a brick sized power
bank or be constantly on the lookout for
a power outlet but what if there was
something better a lighter smaller and
smarter option introducing tag by Sol
Pro Sol per was founded with one goal in
mind and that was to make renewable
energies very convenient ways and bring
them mainstream Sol protag is integrated
with highly efficient SunPower solar
cells that recharge the internal battery
in a matter of hours so I connecting it
to anything that you have by just
hooking it into this these little
bumpers and hooking it on your backpack
you're charging just by walking outside
you're getting more energy into the
battery and then just the size and
weight making it so easy for anyone to
use it anything yeah the contrast of
this to that size blows me away
tag features a clean attractive design
that is water and dust resistant it
attaches neatly to any bag giving you
hassle-free solar charging capability
when you're out and about or on the go
something like this grabbing solar
energy charging up your phone
keeping your Bluetooth headset charged
can be done off of sunlight that you
don't even have to think about tag
weighs less than 2 ounces is the size of
about four credit cards stacked on each
other it can work with any existing USB
cable and can be recharged quickly from
any USB port or on-the-go by the Sun
with a built-in solar cell now what we
need to do is we need to get this in too
many hands as possible we want people to
be using this and that's why we
partnered with tracker the world's
biggest network of users for tracking
devices around the world the world's
biggest lost-and-found
the same features and functionality the
trackers are now in this you know
trackers helping about 2 million people
a day find lost items now we'll be
helping millions more with this
featuring tracker technology via the
tracker app you can locate tag in the
that you lose or misplace your bag
briefcase or backpack or toss it in your
luggage while traveling to keep tabs on
your things tag works with Amazon Alexa
Google home and nest offering all the
features and functionality of a standard
tracker device
well tracker is so thrilled to be
partnering with industry leaders like
Sol pro to integrate and necessary
technology to keep track of our
important thing but that's not it
we've also partnered with OtterBox to
make the tag fully compatible with the
OtterBox universe case system you slide
it onto your case and now you can give
your phone half a charge you can charge
it with the solar panel and it has
tracking so if you lose your phone you
can use family share and your roommate
your spouse can help you find your phone
like that we want the sole pro tag to be
the most accessible product that we've
made to date in order for that to work
we're gonna need your support tag by Sol
pro the world's first and only solar
powered battery pack and Bluetooth
tracker keeping you powered no matter
where life takes you
what if your dog started pooping gold
you
gold coins
or even liquid gold but if there were a
magic solution that could collect all
your dogs poop without any direct hand
contact because in reality your dog
doesn't hope
introducing picker poo a dog parents
dream peekaboo is made up of two parts a
rounded clip of soft silicon cushions
that secures comfortably around your
dog's tail and a durable disposable
collection bag that hangs beneath place
pick a poo on your dog's tail before you
go out for a walk
and when he is ready to poop all the
droppings fall directly into the
collection bag when your dog is finished
pooping you just unclip the bag and
throw it away with no mess and no
leakage in the real world
dog poop is not gold we love our dogs
but don't love cleaning up after them I
grew up having dogs I've always looked
for a better and easier way to pick up
after them but the products in the
market are just not good enough for the
past two years my team and I have worked
hard testing and redesigning and testing
you can to finally come up with the
answer every step of the process has
been about making pick up with something
that real dog owners can actually use we
know that most dog owners want something
they can intuitively use with only one
hand so we build that into pickup ooh -
and it's even small enough to fit in
your pocket we design pickup ooh so
there never has to be contact between
the pool and your hands or even on the
ground everything goes straight into the
bag and in those days after your dog ate
something you shouldn't have
pick up a can handle any bathroom
situation no matter what type of gold
comes out most importantly we wanted to
make sure that pickup would be dog
friendly we've given the pickup food to
more than 100 dogs of different breeds
and sizes and the feedback has been
incredible with your help sharing this
campaign with at least five friends
we're hoping to finally change the lives
of all dog owners by making our locks
easier or street cleaner in our hands
bolting with peekapoo
you will never need to pick up dog poop
again
our ask appeared to be a simple one at
first we wanted beautiful functional
bags that would last a lifetime not just
a season when we couldn't find them we
decided to make them ourselves that's
how we started we needed vignette means
lines in Norwegian and it's a reference
to our minimalist aesthetic and our love
for natural materials each of our
products is designed to let the material
speak for themselves our leather is tend
in the traditional way using plant
extracts and tannins and tree bark the
vegetable tanned leather is a beautiful
natural look and patinas over time our
cotton canvas and linen are made by some
of the most renowned italian mills in
the world our manufacturers supply some
of Europe's leading luxury brands you'll
see the high quality craftsmanship in
the clean finished edges and the
precision in every detail
since our start we've been committed to
making high quality products more
accessible to everyone
we choose not to artificially inflate
our prices so we sell our bags for a
fraction of what other luxury brands
would sell them for we successfully
launched each of our collections with
crowdfunding so far and we're now back
and ready to launch a new line of bags
our suppliers are ready to go and we
just need your help to kick it off
please share our campaign with your
friends and thank you so much for
