large problems we live in a time where

tracked or censored just because you
don't have anything to hide doesn't mean
you don't deserve privacy by the way
stay private and secure is not such an
easy task services are fragmented and
none provide coverage and multiple
devices making it a hassle to stay
protected we created filter in order to
make privacy and security more
accessible and easier to use filter

capability and tor anonymity and all the
devices in your home this is especially
important for devices that don't
