sometimes or worse have you ever felt
that the wires from your earbuds were
inconvenient especially when playing
sports now you have an option
we all loved listening to music on our
smart devices they hold thousands of
songs and they're easy to use but
cramming so many features onto one
device comes at a cost and that cost is
sound quality meat and I am the world's
lightest battery free micro headphone
amplifier for your iPhone iPad and iPod
devices it's also the world's first
headphone amplifier using Apple official
c68
audio lightning adapter and it only
weighs 7 grams minion size stylish
design and meets all your needs for
high-quality music on the go and I am
amplifier 4i devices that makes music
sound amazing the high quality
components in amp I am will give your
music a greater sense of space enabling
you to hear more clearly the separate
instruments voices and melodies detail
is greater so the subtle nuances in
vocal intonation or the way a note is
played can be heard more easily grip on
the lower frequencies will also be
better so bass notes should sound more
tuned for driving their own rhythm
rather than just being heavy and loud
all of this leads to a more emotionally
engaging and therefore enjoyable
experience with amp I am listening to
the music simply becomes more fun it's
easy to set up
amp I am just plug the m-phy certified
lightning connector into your iPhone
iPad or iPod then plug your headphone
jack into amp I am that's it that's
simple and now you can listen to music
the way the artist intended if rumors
have it that the biggest Hardware
revisions of the iPhone 7 are predicted
to Center on the removal of the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack and future
iPhones are released with just a
Lightning port amp I am would allow you
to continue to use your favorite
headphones and will work as an
alternative to whatever
will provides for compatibility with
standard headphones with amp I am you're
ready for the iPhone 7 and beyond

way to work or just relaxing enjoy an
exquisite listening experience studio
quality music that's clearer and crisper
anytime anywhere
we love our smartphones we take them

day keep in touch with friends and
family and for most of us they even
support our work day but all these fun
functions come at a cost
battery don't you just hate it when your
phone runs out of battery
our current solution includes carrying
around our power bank plugs cables and
everything else we need to ensure we
don't run out of juice imagine if there
was a smarter way to save your precious
phone battery from running out all the
time something lightweight and easy to
use
say hello to cube it's the world's first
revolutionary power bank that combines
three features into one compact device
power bank memory card reader sync and
quit charging cable you don't even need
your USB flash drive anymore cube turns
into a memory storage device and it's
compatible with any laptop via the USB
port there's no need to carry around any
other accessories ever cables are often
messy but not Hugh simply wrap it in
this tuck away slot and you're good to
go how really does the cube work well
it's a simple concept just plug your
cube into your phone and into the power
source it detects when your smart phone
is fully charged and redirects the
charge to its internal battery unlike
your power bank that must be charged
separately cube automatically charges
itself while charging your phone so you
always know that cube is there for you
and will never let you down hi my name
is question as every busy person I was
often on the road and almost everyday my
phone was running out of the battery in
the afternoon instead of messy wires and
power bank I wanted to have only one
small device that can replace the number
of
I have to carry everything when we
started to think about the cube look at
the existing technology on the map and
we quickly noticed that most of the
available devices were not complete and
not use a friend
together with fear our head designer we
developed the cube we went through
several prototypes to find the best
design community the designer this
elegant compact and practical it was so
challenging with all those
functionalities together into a small
and cool design this is significant but
if you consider it was something that
had never been done but we made it and
we're so proud and excited to bring it
to you cube is the world's first compact
and lightweight device that combines the
functions of a power bank a memory
storage and a sinking quick charging
cable you'll also agree it's one of the
coolest looking power banks around

technology that we can no longer live
