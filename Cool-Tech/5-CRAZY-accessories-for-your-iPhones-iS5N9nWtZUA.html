embraces the revolution of wireless
charging allowing you to power up your
iPhone 8 or 10 Apple watch and air pods
simultaneously using quick charge
technology the ultra speedy charging
offered by plucks makes your life easier
what's more it allows you to charge your
phone with its case on an easily switch
between a charging pad and phone stand
you don't have to worry the battery life
went binge watching or listening simply
place your devices on a path it will
instantly charge your iPhone Apple watch
and air pods no more dead battery
anxiety
with a simple design flux fits everyone
style plucks the best wireless charger
who allows you to charge your iPhone
Apple watch and air pods all at once
anyone who has ever started a home
improvement project knows that measuring
is the first and most important step in
any process even the slightest
miscalculation can throw off your
project
if you've used traditional measuring
tools you know how frustrating and
inefficient this can be especially with
hard to measure spaces introducing three
days err a revolutionary measuring
device that turns your iPhone into a
smart laser measurer three days er is a
patented more advanced and convenient
way to measure it'll simplify and cut
your measuring time to a fraction of
what you'd normally have to spend and
make your project go more smoothly three
days our attaches magnetically so all
you have to do is snap the case it's
included with the three days or on to
your iPhone and you're ready to go three
days or is the only measuring device on
the market that's driven by an iPhone
app this enables it to use iPhones
advanced embedded sensors to make it
more powerful with three days err you
can measure the space directly or
indirectly making measuring simple and
easy measuring tasks that were once next
to impossible are suddenly made
effortless three days or is sleek
compact and comes with its own
drawstring pouch making it easy and
convenient to have with you wherever you
go use three days or to measure objects
as well as spaces with a click of a
button switch to indirect mode to
measure the distance between two points
after measuring record the measurement
take a photo and add either text notes
or a voice memo it'll automatically
store on your iPhone for future
reference and you can easily share the
information with others
our approach to designing the structure
sensor was to take an incredibly complex
device and make it not only deceptively
simple for the user but aesthetically
pleasing and timeless as well we put a
tremendous amount of time and energy
into the design from the materials we
used for the placement of every
component no space was wasted and no
corners were cut the result was a
beautifully efficient design that
couldn't have been possible without
incredible attention to detail the
single piece aluminum chassis was
designed to not only protect but also
thermally regulate the operating
temperature of the laser inside we also
chose to anodized the chassis to allow
heat to escape that would otherwise be
trapped inside by a painted finish
structure sensor is fully software
control so there are no buttons to
complicate its surface a chemically
treated glass face allows the right
wavelength of infrared light through
providing ideal conditions for the
optics to operate under the chassis all
the components are attached to a single
hand routed PCB this incorporates
features like a pass through to channel
heat from the laser into a heat sink
basin machined into the chassis a
frequency matched infrared structured
light projector and a camera are placed
precisely 65 millimeters apart this
distance provides a reference
measurements by which all other
distances can be accurately calculated a
laser passes through a diffraction
grating to project a speckle pattern
onto the environment the sensor then
gathers the reflected light and
generates depth data the built-in
rechargeable battery is placed between
the optical elements to maximize the use
of space the battery lets the sensor
operate in active mode for 4 hours
without drawing any power from the iPad
the sensors power logic allows it to
intelligently sense how much charge it
can accept and even pass power back to a
connected iPad the bracket is an
important part of the design that allows
for precise placement of the sensor in
relation to the IP
camera a precision latch fixes it
securely to the tablet and the minimal
design ensures you can still access all
the necessary buttons and ports even the
cable was designed to attach perfectly
to the iPad with a right angle to
eliminate any strain or twisting we
wanted to make a device that can be used
by as many people as possible
in as many ways as possible so hack
ability is built into the sensor by
design simple forced screw attachment
makes it easy to mount structure sensor
in other configurations combined with
open-source drivers and the hacker cable
structure sensor can be added to nearly
any setup imaginable it took a
monumental effort from a lot of talented
people to make structure sensor what it
is today made from over 300 individual
components from 10 different countries
the complexity is staggering but it's
all hidden inside an incredibly simple
exterior we're extremely proud of what
we've built we can't wait to see what
the world does with it
