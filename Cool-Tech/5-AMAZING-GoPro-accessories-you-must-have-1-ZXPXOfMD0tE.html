ai is an authoring tool for producing
buttery smooth cinematic GoPro footage
bringing the power of a professional
film crew the palm of your hand the
means to unleash the true potential of
your GoPro unlike any stabilizer before
neon introduces many firsts like a flush
mounted LCD screen for framing each shot
a gamepad like joystick that pans and
tilts to keep focus on your subjects a
long-lasting rechargeable battery to
even juice your GoPro as you film we
also invite you to get creative with a
built-in GoPro accessory mount by taking
great care and crafting the world's most
ergonomic stabilizer Aon is uniquely
curved to fit comfortably right in a
palm of your hand intuitively designed
it delivers an unparalleled user
experience to be sure we tested our
product on people of all ages and
abilities everyday consumers
pro-athletes cinematographers even kids
we also made the conscious decision to
align all details before launching to
separate ourselves from other
crowdfunding campaigns the product
design prototyping and testing are all
finished so your money goes straight to
getting your product commercial units
will be rolling off the production line
early 2016
hey your GoPro is great but couldn't use
a helping hand pre-order you're a on
today and shoot video worth watching
GoPros have revolutionized the world of
video and photography when it comes to
action sports but the reality is most of
us spend more time hanging with friends
than hanging in midair introducing the
exo gp1 a brand new way to make your
gopro go further the gopro is an
incredible camera for a lot of
applications but what we're doing is
helping people revitalize and reinvent
their GoPros the first major feature
that the gp1 adds is the optical
viewfinder previously there was no way
to frame your shots without an external
screen or monitor this clever feature
gives you a simple way to see what
you're shooting and allows you to use
your GoPro just like a regular DSLR or
stills camera the second feature is the
increased size of our design this adds
an ergonomic grip to what was originally
an awkward and clumsy form factor for me
having a comfortable camera to hold it
is really important and that stems right
across from a large professional camera
I would
normally right down to a smaller camera
you don't need to have your large
massive camera but for every type of
shoot the third is the quarter-inch
tripod mount this allows compatibility
with thousands of third-party
accessories that are commonplace in the
camera industry when designing the gp1
we not only wanted to increase the
usability when it comes to stills
photography but we also wanted to add
more functionality to the video
capabilities we installed a cold shoe
mount which allows you to add numerous
accessories such as microphones LED
panels handles for those super low angle
shots and even an iPhone mount to use as
a monitor while filming we've also
incorporated a strap which allows you to
always have your GoPro on hand rather
than having to store it in your backpack
or in your pocket the camera is
constantly at the ready just like a
regular DSLR or stills camera the body
is made of solid aluminium and provides
ample protection for the GoPro we've
also started to develop a series of
filters that will be available for
purchase shortly after the first units
ship these will add all sorts of
functionality from nd filters that
reduce the shutter speed to polarizing
graduated and colorizing filters we've
designed this product from the ground up
to represent the way the majority of
people actually use their GoPros the xog
p1 revitalizes your GoPro and allows you
to use it in all new ways be the first
to own the new EXO GP one and make your
GoPro
further
is it odd between the endless hours of
sifting through hundreds of extra photos
dealing with wasted memory space and
lost battery life we decided it was time
to improve the GoPro experience
introducing go hawk a new way to capture
the action the go hawk is an expansion
pack that adds exciting new features to
your GoPro Hero 4 the go Hawk is a
plug-and-play solution that adds an
external shutter switch remote LED
indicator and allows you to connect a
USB power input so you can shoot all day
with the go Hawk you can use any type of
remote shutter trigger include a bite
tongue and handlebar swiftlets set your
camera to continuous a burst photo mode
to grab high-quality still photos of the
action and oil via our flexible LED
indicator lets you know when you are
ready to shoot and when to add the
auxiliary batter
the red LED mimics the cameras report
and shedder lights the matter what mode
you are shooting it go Hawk uses a side
latch to secure to the back of the GoPro
Hero 4 to ensure that it stays put the
design is compatible with existing GoPro
feeds the go Hawk is perfect for action
sport photographers and videographers
who want more control over their
shooting after 10 long months of
development we created a better solution
that works right out of the box
requiring no additional soft hi I'm Zach
founder of pole labs and creator of the
go Hawk we need your help to cover the
cost of production thanks for your
support
these have transformed the way that we
record video I'm going to show you how
to take it to the next level introducing
Bitzer molest kick changes the way you
record literally the same camera you use
every day will now be recording in 3d
mr. ma is made to be durable and
lightweight so you can take it with you
anywhere just put the lens on and that's
it you're good to go
can you imagine recording this and this
and this all in immersive 3d we can
because we did
you might have seen someone with one of
these 3d rings but probably not they're
bulky and super expensive on top of that
need extra software just to create the
3d video bitch mode is different it
creates the same 3d effect with just one
camera and it's video is ready to be
watched no software needed just upload
and enjoy how well you see just because
you do I may see things from slightly
different perspectives and your brain
combines them so you can see them don't
believe me well try catching a ball with
one eye closed Vilma does the same thing
it uses mirrors to record to perspective
the videos end up looking like this when
you watch them in the viewer their 3d
we're actually going to start shipping
victim elem before the end of the
campaign that's right we're skipping the
lenses before the campaign even finishes
we came to IndieGoGo to find people who
wanted to change the way that we record
so what's your 30 story is it climbing
out Capitan sir from the Gold Coast or
just for your cat suit superhero if you
want to be among the first to start
recording your life in 3d then pick up a
victim a lens I will take recording to
the next level
I
special photographer and have been
traveling with GoPro for years with the
traditional copper scan it takes minutes
to release then tighten the screws to
install and adjust the camera which
could slow down our trips and make us
miss precious moments having dural
inconvenience for years I decided to
design a new stand by chums I saw an
ancient seal of which 14 stems were
kalyanam polyhedron stone it inspired me
to command my newsstand slopes slopes
these walls for a polyhedron support for
GoPro thanks to is three in one slot and
polyhedron bottom slopes provides each
end eight different ways to precision
GoPro and it is even smaller than a
GoPro housing no tripod is needed any
longer slopes provides an arrival
precision speed select a supporting
surface according to the market angle
insert our Cobra into a slot and you are
all set if one direction is in
depression the opposite elevated or need
to do is to car game place which could
be finished in two seconds slopes has
changed settings to meet all your needs
seven landscape peaches a portrait once
and for roles you want to keep it flat
on the ground
the be afraid of scratching football you
can use it this way slopes is obviously
you can use it almost everywhere
- there feels more piece of platform the
whole world would be a tripod slopes can
also provide on a load will climb
without hugging that avoids issues like
low quality audio recording lens layer
and overheating if you have to google
you can utilize the slope side joint
from a dual GoPro CD system slopes can
also benefit the post composition to
pictures shroud with the same bottom
surface could be compensated perfectly
due to the same view angle
slows the stand understands GoPro better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
