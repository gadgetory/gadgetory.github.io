wireless mechanical keyboard built for
you
you
introducing the switch charge the first
battery case designed specifically for
the Nintendo swing like many of you we
love an internal switch we play everyone
go for hours on end the majority of the
time we play on handheld and we keep her
the same property the battery life sucks
however standard battery packs aren't
designed to support the power-hungry
switch and the cables are a pain it is
also not possible to charge whilst you
play on tabletop mode and the building
Kicks down its unstable and flimsy to
combat these problems the switch charge
is born a multifunctional battery case
designed to get the best out of your
Nintendo switch the case is built around
a 12,000 mini amp hour battery that has
been specifically designed to match the
high power requirements of the switch
this gives you up to 12 hours additional
battery taking the switch in a some
cases easy due to our simple locking
mechanism
the kickstand has been completely
redesigned with increased ability to
play on any surface and of multiple
angles it also allows you to charge
whilst on tabletop and with to game card
slots you can now bring your favorite
games with you on the go with multiple
LED lights on the side always know how
much charge you have left
the switch charge has been designed to
be both lightweight and slim perfect to
take with you on the go
the teams worked hard to create a
prototype source of correct components
and build relationships with
manufacturers who can bring this product
to market we have an experienced team of
engineer's and designers who've worked
for companies such as Apple and testing
and they are busy preparing sweet charge
for mass production but we need you the
indigo your community to help make this
product a reality because with your help
we can finally bring all day battery
life to the switch
you
life is about human connection our
strongest bonds are with family but you
can't always be there with them and
calling doesn't give you that same
feeling there are a lot of things you
enjoy doing together that you can't view
through a call so we made omni the robot
that makes these things possible even if
you live miles away omni's in like a
phone call or ordinary video chat
they're there in the robot you have the
control to move and look around and this
frees up the other side from having to
stop and answer a call you can just join
in no matter what they're doing no more
phone tag or scheduling a call like a
meeting our testers are using Omni to do
awesome stuff like cook together hangout
for a barbecue or even watch a whole
movie together it's the stuff they never
do with Skype or FaceTime because it's
just way too cumbersome and the coolest
part is that none of this was planned
out of time as soon as they got the bot
these experiences just happen naturally
we wanted to make a home robot that's
not just a toy but something built to
last and be truly useful week after week
our design philosophy has two main parts
and the first is to maximize the human
connection so omni's made to be human
height to give you that most natural
view of the world people on the other
side can look straight at you and talk
to you just like normal we really wanted
to enhance presence a feeling that
someone's there with you so we designed
Omni with a moving neck and a seamless
control interface we call motion map the
neck may seem subtle but we found it
really makes experience a lot more
engagement a lot more human so the
second part of our design philosophy is
the minimize all hassle because nothing
should get in the way of the Omni
experience setup is simple unfold
connect to Wi-Fi and call in with just
one click and there's no software to
install we also made Omni super quiet so
you can hang out for a long time without
bugging anyone and if you need to move
it around it's light you can take
upstairs move it out in the patio or
pull it up into your car you know if
they're worried about keeping it charged
when you're finished press one button to
auto dock
ami is different right down to its
materials and how we make it resource
sustainable bamboo when we use sudden
anodized aluminum another cool thing is
we use additive manufacturing to build
Omni in a scalable and efficient way
we're doing it all in-house to keep it
lean and that means less risk we've
already been shipping Omni to test users
around the world for over a year we're
also backers like you tired of campaigns
over-promising and under-delivering so
that's why we waited to launch our
campaign until now after two years and
nine generations and prototypes we're
super passionate about bringing families
closer and with your support we can
bring the Omni experience to everyone
join our campaign and enjoy Omni with
your own family
