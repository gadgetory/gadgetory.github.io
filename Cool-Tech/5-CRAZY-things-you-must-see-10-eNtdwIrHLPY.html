been there spilling our wine beer scotch
or favorite drink and the more we drink
the more likely we are to knock them

of wasted alcohol we set out to create
the first bar where that won't fall we

mighty mugg bar where is virtually
unbreakable and is top rack dishwasher
safe for easy cleaning after launching
our travel mug last year and receiving
press from around the world many asked
us for a mighty mugg to enjoy their

hi I'm Dolly design or fixture lakes
I've been working this project for two
years I expect this list will not only
simplify tying your shoes it's going to
be even tied in one hand only but also
to become a new fashion accessory that
modern look and different colors can fit
two area of physical pain with your
support I hope you can start some cereal
production period in that depends in
fashion accessory stores or around the
world that's my dream I want to achieve
your preacher listing
introducing eros the first protective
hearing device that is designed with
music lovers in mind never get home from
a concert a club or any loud event with
muffled hearing or a ringing in your
ears that acoustical hangover is the
sign of hearing damage at arrows were
out to change this with our
patent-pending technology we have
developed a solution that reduces
decibel levels maintains quality of
sound and lessons hearing damage hi my
name is Ronnie madra and i'm the founder
and inventor of Eros I have
noise-induced hearing loss i also have
tinnitus I own and operate several
nightclubs I'm in loud environments all
the time seven days a week I need to do
something not only for myself but for
people that I I host or people that come
to my places 80 decibels of sound is
what OSHA recommends hearing protection
at and that's roughly the sound of
walking down the street in new york city
what eros was designed to do which is so
cool is that it blocks the bad decibels
from getting in while still allowing
sound quality through this little tiny
sound board that travels through the
product to an acoustical filter you can
stand at a concert and hear the music
crisply while still protecting your ears
from the damaging decibels what I
thought was really exciting and
interesting about the approach that
running in the team took was that they
incorporated app technology into the
whole product set and what does that
mean that they've created a solution
that allows you to really understand
what's happening in your is based upon
the noise levels around you since this
product doesn't operate on batteries it
doesn't require us to make it
rechargeable we don't have to provide an
extra plug with it we've designed the
passive technology this has a very
strong health benefit I think that's
important I think because I feel it I
know it I live it I want to keep
building clubs I want to keep throwing
events and I want to keep being in
hospitality that's what I love to do
we need your help back this project
share with your friends help us help you
protect your hearing thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
