at Planet computers we are passionate
about typing writing being productive
creating on the go since the
introduction of touchscreen mobile
phones and tablets we feel that it is
very difficult to type on these types of
devices we decided to reinvent the palm
sized keyboard mobile device that will
benefit many who miss using the keyboard
on the move from bloggers and creatives
that need to constantly right
professionals who need to read and write
email create and edit documents and
spreadsheets hi I'm Martin relief it I'm
a founder of the air for which is a
london-based design consultancy and we
in the past have made a reputation from
designing a lot of handheld electronic
equipment including Scion PDAs in the
90s PDAs our personal digital assistants
bizarrely they've sort of dropped out of
fashion we have always been strong
proponents for this kind of device we
feel it's time to bring it to the market
again because so many people they say
why because never product life is now
planet computers introduces the gemini
a modern clamshell based mobile device
with a palm sized keyboard fully
integrated into the device it's sleek
metal clamshell design both protects the
device and beautifully tucks away the
palm-sized QWERTY keyboard and screen
when closed
it fits into a pocket roughly the same
as today's mobile phone when open the
innovative clamshell also acts as a
support of the device the ultra wide 5.7
inch high res touch screen provides
ample space for creating on the go the
full tactile keyboard is recognized as
the world's smallest keyboard for finger
touch typing Gemini has a powerful 10
core processor a graphics coprocessor
and 64 gigabytes of storage it is fully
equipped with 4G Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
enabling both data communications and
mobile phone calls it is designed to run
the latest Android OS and all your
favorite apps as well as Linux with a
dual boot option all below 400 grams of
weight the double sized battery provides
two weeks standby and 12 hours talk time
Gemini allows you to work in restricted
spaces comfortably on planes on trains
in coffee bars you can also hold the
device and use it with ease whilst in
the car standing up or on the bus I hope
you're interested in what we're trying
to do we think it's going to be a great
device thanks for watching please
