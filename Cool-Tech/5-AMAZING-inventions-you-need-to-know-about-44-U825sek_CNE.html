creator of the Jeep and where does the
pudgy pen you might ask the fiddy pen is
the world's first fun to play with and
discreet digitally why do you see the
vid you pen let's take a look a pause
pause about to kiss this beautiful young
woman but then because of this oversized
fidget toys I totally ruin it don't let
this happen to you how many times this
happen to you or people around you
you're fidgeting with things and it's
distracting every Tom Dick and Harry
let's see a day in the life of Paul and
see what happens Paul stop be
hope he doesn't make nap on that one oh
great that dump on my girlfriend kicked
out of school and I just killed Carol
excuse me sir I'm not dead yet a quiet
grandma make a crowdfunding video out of
here did you just self edit your own
curse word Pablo you really think i'm
going to put myself in bars and say
curse word on crowdfunding video get out
Wow hope it doesn't get sent to the
dean's office so fidgeting got the best
of you huh you're almost to pull my
finger
sake you're seeing you later
Oh
wait what's what in your pocket so why
did we create the fiddy pen research has
shown that when we're experiencing
anxiety or boredom fidgeting is the
body's natural mechanism to help us stay
focus present and in the moment so the
reason we created the officiating
features embedded inside of the pen is
that so people could fidget more
discreetly you know there's a lot of
other fidget toys out there but the
problem is they're too large and too
distracting the others that's why we
believe that fidgeting is for anyone who
wants to stay focused relax and have fun
in the process also research has shown
that people with a TD ADHD and autism
can greatly benefit from fidgeting we
believe that habits such as nail-biting
leg shaking and finger tapping can be
channeled into the fidji pen to help
people stay cool calm and collected
thank you for supporting us sure this
campaign of social media will give you
two free ink refills welcome to the busy
family
freaking millennial
I online fans more fans the vendors fans
new movie in cinemas I don't have to
explain why I have a iron man cloth on
my hand it's yeah kind of like Iron Man
2 and Avengers 1 and a difference to all
my other lasers is light and sound we
pause the lights and burn later i will
show you that one later in action main
teacher is actually a the other one
which is in Ireland to he used it to cut
rose and ass pretty quickly wedges are
not as powerful new laces so this one
won't actually do much but it's actually
just a prop because in the movie he did
this and then you did chase and that's
actually that's so cool I could do this
all day actually I did today and yeah
reload put it back in snaps closed trap
and try to do it again and we just will
I want to and yeah for the shell in the
move you don't even see what it is I'll
just use the piece of aluminum tried to
make it look cool things a little bit
and shoot some holes in it and to make a
writer also and yeah it's actually
really just put it back in push click
and so cool um you can see their
potential springs and that's a little
slide and yeah in the rear this one is
solenoid i salvaged from my paintball
marker to fire the mechanism and like
that and yeah that's probably the best
feature I have came up with it's really
just a movie like so I don't like the
good-looking gauntlets which just do
nothing it's just you know too simple
and so yeah mine will at least boot
stuff do stuff and get xpresso little
text yep let's go on a few things with
the main laser
you can almost feel like right on it
looks great
ouch
doesn't even take a second paper and
would cling test yep so the inside
that's the solenoid as mentioned servo
for the music and red laser and this is
the slot for that little sucker made
from scratch as always the paint looks
really nice by the way and coming down
my face we did that and yeah that's can
it stop me if you like shall the hell
out of it spread the word and till next
time
nowadays almost everything is code
encrypted your phone your iPad your
Wi-Fi your suitcase the door of your
building and of course your credit card
has a digit code for sure it's better to
be safe by the way how safe is your
wallet in your own home for example have
you ever realized you were missing some
cash or is it safe in your own bedroom
your credit card number never ended up
on the internet without your consent at
the office are you really sure nobody
can sneak in your wallet and violate
your privacy then we realized there was
one item that we don't secure enough our
wallets this is why we created and are
proud to present the many safe wallet
the first code encrypted pocket-sized
vault including a locking system with a
thousand different combination
possibilities and a choose your own
system it's amazing how much progress
has been made in terms of tracking
systems lately that's why we propose the
option to embed your wallet with a
tracking system to ensure you never lose
it again it's also guarded with RFID
blocking technology your contactless
cards will be kept safe and protected
from electronic pickpockets the lock is
made out of metal for maximum
reliability it is extremely handy thanks
to its band shape interior giving easy
access to all your cards which are
stored and well sorted it can hold US
dollars and euros and fit up to 12 cards
we've been working on this idea for the
past two years with professional
engineers to reinvent and develop the
locking system to adapt it to a wallet
it's very light and strong thanks to its
conception and high quality materials
we've also been working with a designer
Erik virtus and his design agency in
Paris to make this wallet aesthetically
beautiful and practical in its use so if
you think this is a great product for
yourself your friends or relatives we
would love to have you on board as a
backer and don't forget better to be
safe
you
we decided to design it multi tool that
combines all of our favorite features
into an ultra low profile tools that we
call the titanium pocket this new tool
is made from aerospace grade 5 titanium
alloy despite its minimal name and
appearance this new pocket tool is
extremely versatile and let's do more
Carolyn
you
you
lock technology hasn't improved in
almost 100 years who doesn't have a lock
that's completely useless because of a
forgotten combination or lost key at
best we waste time searching for the
right key or fumbling through the
combination infused designs we thought
it was time for the padlock to enter the
21st century so we created the no key
you
very
by using your smartphone and enoki you
can effortlessly protect your belongings
and go whether you're protecting your
bike your locker or anything else all
you need is your smartphone and your no
key and you're good to go the no key
uses wireless Bluetooth technology when
clicked it automatically looks for a
phone with a compatible key and unlocks
you don't even need to remove your phone
from your pocket or purse the Nokia
Lau's you to easily share your
belongings safely and securely while
maintaining total control with the note
key sharing keys has never been easier
or safer with the Nokia app you can
quickly give access without the hassle
or risk of giving up your key our iOS
and Android apps allow sharing to be
done on a one-time basis multi-use basis
or any other customized schedule you
need giving access to your pool it's
just a click away giving access to your
storage unit is just a click away
it fused product design is our passion
form and function complement each other
in an attractive and simple design we
made the Nokia with a water-resistant
shell devoid of any external buttons and
built with a user replaceable battery
that lasts over a year when it's time to
replace the battery simply unlock the no
key and replace it no tools required
what if your phone dies or is not with
you we thought of that too by
incorporating our quick click technology
you can create your own access code to
use when your smartphone is unavailable
making sure you'll never be left
stranded again the peace of mind along
with the convenience you'll gain by
incorporating the Nokia into your life
makes it a great investment for you and
a great gift for friends and family no
key no problem use designs
