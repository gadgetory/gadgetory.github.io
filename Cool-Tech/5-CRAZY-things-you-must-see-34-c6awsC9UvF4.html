introducing the skull and co switch case
so I bought the new Nintendo switch just
like you did I love my Nintendo switch I
take it everywhere with me providing me
with hours of entertainment but I always
find my hands getting tired from playing
for a long period of time
so I thought to myself why isn't there a
case with comfortable gripping for the
switch just like the other joy Khan's
then I started designing by gathering
simple data within the market for
instance kids and adults hand shape and
sizes we've built various prototypes in
order to fulfill our vision firstly we
wanted the case to have a cool and slick
look we designed two sets of grips in
gray or neon red and blue to match your
Nintendo switch they can be easily
switched to fit comfortably within the
gamers hold the case will provide a
stronger grip and more comfortable
experience no matter children or adults
casual or hardcore gamers
the switch-case is made of soft TPU
material which makes it easy to put on
and remove we made the back of the
switch-case extremely thin so there is
no need to remove the case to charge
your Nintendo switch in the dock plus we
have also designed a hardshell case to
store the Nintendo switch when the
switch case is on the hardshell case
provides extra storage spaces click
power bank adapter USB cable handset and
almost everything you think is necessary
just pack and go you'll love it we are
expanding and our manufacturer partners
are ready to go with the support we can
take switch case into mass production
every amazing creation begins with the
clash of two very different elements how
its last created how do we get to see
beautiful rainbows how do you create a
peanut butter and jelly sandwich in our
case two life partners who love design
and technology at ara owns the design
house and David high tech entrepreneur
with lots of business travel mileage
this is their creation introducing
samsara

you to control the LED light within the
suitcase which will assist you in the
dark and monitor the battery life
