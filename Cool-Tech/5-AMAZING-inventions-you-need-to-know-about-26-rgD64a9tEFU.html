hello kick starter Jake here almost
three years to the day after launching
our campaign for the duo coffees TV
fellow is back with our sophomore effort
the stag EKG an electric pour over
kettle with barista level functionality
are small but mighty team launch stag is
a stovetop kettle 14 months ago and it
quickly became a favorite for home
baristas design lovers and coffee pros
competing in the world Brewers come so
why launch the electric version of
staying quite simply because you asked
for it we carried for the two features
you know and love from the stovetop stag
first a weight in the handle moves the
center of mass closer to your hand for a
more controlled for and second the
fluted tip allows for the finest of
water streams during brewing but you can
get these features with our current
kettle we know you're here for the new
stuff
you
after countless design iterations we
landed on a minimalist almost on
assuming base that serves as a podium to
display stag we believe the base itself
should take a backseat to both stag and
your kitchen however don't let the
simplicity fool you stag EKG packs a
professional punch no simple on/off
button here folks by turning the knob
you select your desired temperature and
stag does the rest winner hold mode
steak will maintain that temperature for
30 minutes in case you get distracted
why are we so obsessed with temperature
because your favorite beans deserve
better than about boiling depending on
your bean roast or brew method you need
the ability to lock in temp to brew your
best cup and Haiti lowers this doesn't
only apply to coffee drinkers
temperature matters for you as well damn
it G I belong at 185 we want you along
for the journey your support will help
with product development certification
and tool so are you ready to brew the
best um Jake that's really awesome and
all but don't the coolest Kickstarter's
have some hyper local social disruptive
value add technology like like what oh I
don't know how about an app that lets
you turn the kettle on and off and set
the temperature yeah I'm listening but I
feel like it just needs more you should
partner with those awesome folks at
akaya who make the sweet connected scale
and brew bar appt the cuddle should
seamlessly connect to the app so we can
talk to the ukiah scale and baratza
grinder and remember your favorite
coffee recipe think about it wizard like
control and total mastery over water
temperature dosage and coffee to water
ratio with the push of a button a coffee
nerd or cafe owners dream
yeah creepy voice over guy you're right
we should have two models the stag EKG
and the stag EKG plus powered by a kind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
