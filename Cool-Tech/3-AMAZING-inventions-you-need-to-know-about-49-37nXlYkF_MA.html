where does it come from how much do you
use what if there is a fun way to learn
about energy with the object around hi
I'm David and it's better together
the bomb we developed to Mars to allow
children to learn about electricity the
most importantly fire them create
objects like powered by alternative
sources of energy
occasional kit includes the energy club
specifically designed to harness by both
the management our easy-to-follow
instructions and our cumin game that
makes learning about energy challenge
expand once you have fully charged your
energy block you can power all third
circuit invention even devices you can
code and use the energy you apart our
team has the opportunity to work with
hundreds of kids with the intention to
understand how to engage learning in a
subjects so universally important as
clean accessible energy
we have developed a number of prototypes
and are now ready to bring to you the
first key market all our partners are on
standby we just need to make the minimum
order for our initial production run but
please help us together let's buy it
thanks to the ratio
started this journey three years ago to
make your phone work more like a camper
because it's creatives the camera has
become our common tool in an area where
it's nearly impossible to get lost
hammer inspires us to trust it is our
compass our anti GPS device it leads us
to explore and discover and highly
personal way it gives us pause in a
world that is speeding up around us it
reminds us that when hits likes and
comments fade away we're in the presence
of something big we are moments and we
believe that the future photography is
in typography
hi Kickstarter we're back three years
ago you back their first project at the
moment levels a year later you enabled
us to make the world's first case mobile
photography and today we need your help
introduce the next generation of moment
products this is our most ambitious
project yet introducing not one but
three new products photo capes the
battery photo case and our brand new
wide line these are the best products
we've ever made we think you're going to
love them
the more we shoot the more battery we
require constantly on the go we don't
always have time to find a wall plug or
space to carry a pocketful of cables and
power bags so we created a new type of
battery case one that brings power and
photography together like never before
with 2500 and 3500 milliamp power
batteries these cases are powerful
enough to double the life of your iPhone
7 and 7 plus the two-stage DSLR like
shutter button enabled focus clock and
rapid shooting in the moment app or
faster capture in the iPhone camera app
shooting moving subjects just got easier
with a redesigned lens interface you can
now rotate and click a moment lens into
place and if you're shooting on the 7
plus you can now mount our glass over
either lens on the phone unlocking even
more creativity but it's the strap
attachment that truly turns your phone's
back into a camera if you love to take
pictures this is the battery case for
you the photo case is everything we love
about minimal photography adding only 3
millimeters and thickness to your phone
this is the thinnest lens mountable case
you've ever made it's slim and
unobtrusive in your pocket yet readily
available when you want to shoot and
just like the Profoto case we have
included our new lens interface and
camera strap attachment turning your
phone into an even better camera through
all the customers who ask for a thin
non-electronic moment case this one's
for you
when Apple introduced iPhone 7 they
change the landscape of mobile
photography their use of high-speed F
1.8 next generation 12 megapixel sensors
an optical image stabilization brought a
new level of image quality to your
pocket in order to deliver the best
quality imaginable
our only choice was to redesign our
glass from the ground up this glass a
spheres improves on our already
class-leading distortion correction and
maintains razor sharp images on iPhones
f 1.8 aperture in order to accommodate
the larger iPhone aperture we made this
blend slightly bigger enabling us to
take advantage of every photon without
compromise a larger lens also makes the
optics more tolerant to misalignment so
unwanted dark corners are a thing of the
past our new moment wide lens is without
a doubt the best lens we've ever made
each moment products start with the
customer inspired by travel the new
moment cases were studying subtraction
realizing that Fitness is everything we
design a trusted battery to maximize
power and reduce physical size we also
dramatically improve the sector field of
the shutter button trying to match the
precision feedback of a professional
camera using the Lightning port the
loaders to remove bluetooth for more
reliable connection we then study stuff
on the phone language and expose a
variety of textures to make one-handed
shooting easier everything we learned
from creating the first moment case and
so need to making these ones our best
work yet
we're now ready to bring these new
products to life but we need your help
this is the most technically advanced
project we've ever embarked upon which
means that the tooling and manufacturing
costs are significant the money we're
raising goes directly towards covering
these costs as we move from a prototype
through production with your help we can
take the next step in making your phone
an even better camera join them find
time life is just about saying maybe
there's some other stuff to do but there
comes a smart life to transform the way
you sleep and wake up it's the left the
time you want to wake and up will come
on just like it wasn't naturally with
the bright sunshine up also features
natural sounds to help heavy sleepers
get out of bed easily and naturally now
you can be a morning person when it's
time to sleep up stands out a red wave
light as a signal for your body to have
a good rest

sleep cycle download the free app and

6000 mAh rechargeable battery an
