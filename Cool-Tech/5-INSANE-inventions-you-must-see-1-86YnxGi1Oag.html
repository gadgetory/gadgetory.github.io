go for whatever reason piece is a
simplest solution this is how it works
take the SIM card out from your work
phone put in beefs connect piece to your
private phone via bluetooth and now you
can get rid of your work phones when
your friends or family call your private
number hey I'm gonna shoot right now can
I call you back in a minute
or your boss calls your working number
it all happens in one phone by the peace
app so you can control all the settings
of both your numbers separately manage
your contacts send text messages
basically just work your phone like you
normally do peace is so small it fits
easily anywhere you barely even know
it's there
oh one last thing
when your phone and peace are over 15
meters apart peace will ring to prevent
you from losing your only phone you can
also use peace to look for your phone
just like you would your car in the
parking lot that way we make sure you
have one and only one phone on you at
all times
likewise if peace is in your wallet
you can use the peace app to look for it
so it's nothing big just this piece
right here and it will certainly make
your life a little easier hi I'm Ryan
and I'm Elias we are part of the team
behind sonic soak sonic soak is a
smartphone sized device that uses
ultrasound technology to clean almost
anything in ways never before possible
it clings to the microscopic level
beyond what any laundry machine or
cleaning spray can do the inspiration
for this device came from the fact that
we were frequent travelers and cleaning
our clothes while on the go was always a
hassle so we had to set out to find a
good solution it's also quiet
and can be used to clean more than
clothes it can clean glasses jewelry
fruits razors baby bottles the products
that are tough to clean using sponges or
rags or your hands or soap and water I
think they get the idea is okay I just
want to be clear this is the best way to
clean pretty much anything sonic soak
works by generating ultrasonic sound
waves that create microscopic high
pressure bubbles to wash away dirt grime
and oils it's also simple to use you
simply place it in water add some soap
turn on the built-in timer and walk away
minutes later your clothes are cleaner
than ever before
sonic Stoke is designed for travelers
moms neat freaks looking for a thorough
cleanse and not just on clothes by the
way but on fruits and vegetables to
folks with small loads of laundry
fashionistas that eat a better solution
for their gentle cycle or hand wash only
clothes folks that don't have the space
for a full sized laundry machine really
it's for anyone who wants a cleaner will
almost anything now you can enjoy a
cleaner lifestyle wherever you go
I like music I like streaming music I
like music when I'm snowboard I like
music when I'm hiking I like music when
I'm in the subway I like music when I'm
running music makes it more fun I like
music when I work out because it helps
me zone out but my phone is huge I look
ridiculous and of course my battery is
almost dead again from streaming my
music these notifications keep
interrupting my music and I cracked my
phone again I need to disconnect so I
can focus on myself and just be with my
music
I need a streaming music player that's
durable and can take my music offline
mighty is the first device to play your
streaming audio like Spotify on the go
without a smartphone
enjoy your workouts and commutes and
adventures without worrying about bulky
phones data overages and battery frames
disconnect from digital distractions and
be one with your music for a healthier
and more mindful life
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
