create a short ball deck it's really
indistinguishable from a non power board
what you think it's near perfect design
for both fun and transportation
it's thin like and simple it exactly
does what it's supposed to do
whether cruising the streets are
tracking the park hey but don't be
afraid to scare it hard bluebird uses
standard tracks and 83 millimeters
impact absorbing polyurethane skate
wheels with one important difference
there's two 1.5 kilo watt motors inside
driving them to user control speeds of
over 35 kilometres per hour and travels
over 24 kilometres we took special care
designing a wireless handle threat for
acceleration and braking the design
clean without any unnecessary
decorations yes we are Swiss and cross
pattern on the deck from percent to come
to this origin on functional side it
helps assist with good grip for
increased stability let's face it
skating is more fun than biking and lot
more convenient no need to waste time
looking for a lock-up spot nothing heavy
to carry the little board is really
small it's small enough for urban
commuters like me to take away a train
bus our unit the office the carbon fiber
shell way more durable than any wood
deck will be it keeps the board super
light or protecting the sensitive
electronics and ultra-thin battery
inside
if our manufacturers line up me of our
global distribution network in place and
most importantly it's funny you never
look at album travel the same way again

forever congratulations on your new
smart garden here's how to set it up
once you've unboxed your new click and
grow smart garden starter kit put the
transparent domes aside then take out
the cavities and remove the u-shaped
lids like so now it's time to plant your
plants first unwrap your new smart soil
capsules then carefully place them in
the cavities pop the u-shaped lids back
on them and click the cavities in the
garden place the plastic domes back over
each capsule until the sprouts reach
them they ensure faster and healthier
germination to keep track of your plants
you can label each capsule the plastic
cavities u-shaped lids and domes are
reusable so make sure to not throw them
away after use fill the garden up with
water until the float is on the same
level with the lid and not higher add
more water once the float has sunk down
to the bottom again now you can plug
your garden in and start growing
the light turns on right away and has an
automatic working cycle of 16 hours on
and eight hours off plug it in right
after waking up so it turns off
automatically in the evening the smart
garden comes equipped with two light arm
extensions to bring the light to a
higher position take the lamp off the
garden add the extension and place the
lamp back on top of it that's it enjoy
click and growing
