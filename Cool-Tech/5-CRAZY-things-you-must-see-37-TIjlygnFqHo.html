million litres of wine are poured down
the plughole that's a massive 270
million pounds down the drain you know
how it is you crack open that one last
bottle with friends the weekend and then
the rest ends up on your kitchen counter
for three days exposed to oxygen and
your vino turns to vinegar sure these
wine preservation devices out there but
they're either ineffective as a wine is
still in contact with some air or
expensive and you tied into pricy
refills which got me thinking there had
to be a better way to preserve your
wines for flavor no matter how much you
had left so I came up with a tall simple
elegant and it really works here's how
to count your whole bottle into ethyl
this opens up the wine and brings out
its character pour yourself a glass the
sharp lip gives drip-free pouring but
then here's the magic push down on the
neck and the unique patented design for
was a complete seal preventing any
further contact with oxygen to preserve
your wines for flavor
ideally store a toe in the fridge to
keep both white and red in perfect
condition until you decide it's time for
another glass then simply tip at all and
the innovative valve automatically opens
as you pour no gases no pumping the
constrict wine of its flavor just good
practical design
to test its preservation capability we
took our prototypes the laboratories of
Bangor University be tested at all
against leaving wine in a quart bottle
and the number of other well-known
preservation solutions
the results were indisputable at all far
outside forms them all I was really
amazed and I have to say surprised when
I first tried it I couldn't believe that
a wine which had been decanted into it
seven days beforehand tasted every bit
as fresh at the wine which had come from
a recently opened bottle but it also had
the added benefits of decanting in that
the wine was breathing it was opening up
it was tasting absolute delicious
yeah okay that sounds good I'll see you
in a bit so you might not been able to
hear that for using Ori I was able to
have a call and that's because Ori is
avoid a citizen ring that turns your
finger into a smartphone all through
just a touch of the year but why that's
because the way in which we're using a
device's is changing changing from a
world where we use screens and touch to
one where we talk now Ori uses bone
conduction and bone conduction has been
used in many medical grade devices we
package it in a way that attended by
Britain's through your finger directly
into your ear so only you can hear and
that allows you to hear and talk to just
your finger and then that's music lovely
thanks to bone conduction and the dual
noise cancelling microphone you can hear
and talk even and lastly
so check this out or is perfectly
private and discreet using it makes a
future success secret in Asia a nori is
more than just a neat gadget for taking
and making calls because behind it is
powerful voice artificial intelligence
our friends series in Google assistant
it puts them exactly where you need them
think about all the different things
that you can do and one of my favorite
translation all you have to do is just
motion upwards and say all right how do
I say where are the burritos in Spanish
hello Rodrigo understand los burritos
and just like burritos come in different
flavors Ori comes in three different
colors I guarantee you there's an oil
ring for every outfit and every occasion
and even better Ori is splash proof too
look guys I know how popular you are and
that's why you have the Ori app because
it helps you filter out everything else
and there's four LED lights that tell
you what kind of messages are coming
through come on let's hit the streets to
see what people think a boring hey I'll
just watch really clear
thousands of people have tried or it and
we're finally ready to start making and
sharing the origin with the rest of the
world and with everything that's
happened I can't help but think of our
inspiration
my dad he also happens to be visually
impaired Ori doesn't just help the
visually impaired access something that
has difficulty before smartphones but in
turn they have inspired us to use our
devices the new natural screen freeways
I really want our venture in darkness to
power the screen cream revolution thanks
for watching guys remember to pack us
today because one day with Ori you too
can find your voice
hi my name is Fabio I have a project
that I love and I want to share it with
you followed me in 2010
I found our led company that designed
and manufactured underwater rock cycle
with my team we designed a few clubs the
first underwater drone for the care of
your house we started working from
similar products that were available on
the market and the water rocks for
aquarium tank after three years of
research and development we present
skill traps we don't sold the first
vessel but all the ranges the
professional clients in order to receive
a qualitative feedback sales staff two
years ago with throw and stay one mode
we manufacture or assemble everything in
the house only after passion all the
undersea rigorous there the drone is
ready to be shipped thanks to 3d
printing we give full shape to our
project what they think we can design
and mold by O'Fallon is the proof of how
live the sea a unicellular and
multicellular organisms take root on
every underwater cities and grow
unfortunately on the house of those
clothes loss of speed and increase the
consumption just five millimeters of
vegetation controls an increase of 20%
of power consumption
nowadays many remedies are offered on
the market most uses soft explain in
order to slow down the proliferation
process cleaning and painting is a very
expensive process every year millions of
boat owners spend money and time to
clean and paint the house of their boats
keel crop is revolutionary it solves the
problem by acting on the effect and not
on the code you can use it where you
want when you want without moving the
boat kill crab is already a reality is
another dream the greater the order the
louder will be the signal of change or
market thanks to crowdfunding we could
move from a manual production entry and
industrialize the production the
increase in market allows us to invest
many resources in research and
development in order to enhance our
products in terms of quality cleaning
capacity and automation the team is
really motivated we will never talk
until every boat will be clean like our
drone kill craft the first underwater
drone with iPad and draw the control for
cleaning and affection of your heart
that essential state 3 and user friendly
support has with your pre-order and help
us to make this possible
