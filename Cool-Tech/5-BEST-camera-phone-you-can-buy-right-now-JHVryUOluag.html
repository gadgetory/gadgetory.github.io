Wow
you
today we're not just launching our new
phone we are launching a new way of
thinking about what a phone can do a
phone that makes you rethink the phone
introducing Samsung Galaxy s7 and s7
edge we spend more time with our phones
than ever and yet they're not designed
to be held comfortably but now with the
elegant back curve of the s7 and the
streamlined front and back of the s7
edge both nestled perfectly into the
palm of your hand they feel smaller and
thinner with smoother edges and sleeker
lines but the screen size is still the
way you like it big and immersive a true
marvel of engineering it's as beautiful
to look at as it is to use
we've also redesigned the s7 with memory
that expands because we know you love
file hungry movies music and games
here's the Vulcan API for the most
realistic mobile gaming possible 4
gigabytes of RAM to keep all your tabs
open and a longer-lasting battery to
keep you going all day and beyond our
phones go everywhere with us except in
water well until now even in the rain
the shower or the pool open up a new
world to use it in
the s7 has a phone camera that uses the
technology found in professional cameras
100% of the pixels are used to focus and
every single one works just like our to
eyes which means you have autofocus in a
split second
and you can shoot in the dark and own
the night because some of our most
precious memories happen in the dark not
only can you leave your camera at home
leave your wallet to Samsung pay is safe
simple and accepted virtually anywhere
you can swipe or tap your card so travel
light and with Knox security worryfree
the new s7 redefines how you can use a
phone but what really breaks the
boundaries of what a phone can do is a
completely new way to share memories now
you can record your life with the 360
camera previewed on your phone and then
simply load it into your VR headset
imagine this simple 5-inch phone is now
your personal 360 cinema screen
you define the possibilities and we'll
redefine the phone Samsung Galaxy s7 and
s7 edge rethink what a phone can do
you
can you feel it the power all in your
hand trust the power camera launched in
record time always ready
next generation design from inside out
earth glass seamless metal expanding new
mobile experiences predicting the
movement autofocus sharp precise xperia
x performance the masterpiece from Sony
you
so what exactly is this if you want a
camera it becomes a digital camera
easily held in one hand if you want a
music player it becomes a bno premium
hi-fi music player you can take shots as
wide as your own eyes can see and check
the time always there without even
lifting a finger
but this thing that lets you easily take
charge have fun and play with all these
new devices so what is this LG g5 and
Friends life's good when you play more
LG g5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
