your daily lifestyle so that whenever
you step out the door or you're going to
the gym whatever you carry is all just
you really need it hasn't been easy to
create not to create the perfect wallet

prototypes tests and fabrication methods
to finally create something like
steering paddle but without your support
I will only remain a prototype so we
will love your help to bring back
tonight so that√≠s today Mac the wallet
made with a touch of magic

how we keep our change with device also
of methods to walk around this age old
dilemma a let's face it our wallets just
don't fit the bill we've always receive
change together so why must we separate

testing to bring your kids an elegant
solution to an everyday problem designed
to give you a better wala experience we
hope to make in a reality in order to do
so we need your help fund us today and
help us make a change with Kim
imagine a world we only had to buy
things once the cardamom roller is built
to last forever this could be the last
wallet you ever have to buy the cardamom
wallet is a minimalist full-size
billfold that aims to be the perfection
of the traditional wallet it's the
smaller size you can make without
compromising functionality cut from a
single sheet of fabric folded welded and
stitched it all sounds simple but
interestingly it's one of the most
challenging things that I've developed
we're employing some very complex
technology and construction methods that
have never been used to make a wallet by
using high-frequency welding and heat
press to thermo format we've eliminated
a lot of stitching and reduced it to an
amazingly small footprint
the fabric we developed is unique it
combines a high density weave of nylon
and polyester fibers laminated with an
aerospace grade urethane film then
coated with a proprietary treatment to
provide a luxurious feel this new
material is paper-thin virtually
indestructible and sets a new standard
for durability performance and
versatility we genuinely want to make a
better product so we've taken a lot of
time over the past three years refining
hundreds of prototypes to prove that our
solution is exceptional for us cardamon
represents more than just a brand it
embodies our philosophy our aesthetic in
our approach to design
we're not trying to reinvent anything
cardamom is about simplifying refining
and enhancing it's about making your
experience better so Kickstarter this is
where we need your support we've refined
our design and set up production but we
need your help to finalize packaging
fulfil minimum orders and turn the
carbon wallet into reality please help
us achieve our dream by supporting this
project any way that you can whether
you're one of the first to own a
cardamon wallet or you simply share this
project with your friends we want to
thank you for being part of our journey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
