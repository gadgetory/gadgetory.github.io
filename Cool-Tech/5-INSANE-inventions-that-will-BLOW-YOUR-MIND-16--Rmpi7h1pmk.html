waterproof and works with braces and
dental prosthesis

easier than ever to brush quickly so you
can continue to take care of you
I'm a brush the world's first automatic
toothbrush what you're seeing is a man
fighting a teddy bear in the snow this
man is not crazy he is the presenter of
apricot the most innovative durable
feature-packed goddamn terrific
adventure coat and it won't burn hole in
your pocket how come because while big
grand companies spend their money on ads
and stores we spent our budget on
research development and materials to
make a better coat even this video is
the cheapest video we could possibly
make one cameraman
one presenter and one incredible
adventure coat apricot was made by real
adventurers who went through every
possible challenge to find what a real
adventure coat means every aspect of the
coat was rethought from the ground up it
all starts with climate show an
innovative insulation system that keeps
you warm in cold conditions and cool in
warm ones and is super breathable and
super likely they got you hope you liked
I mean it is the coat light cool with
apricot we also rethought the way
pockets are built into jackets each of
apricots many many pockets was designed
individually to fit any essentials you
need to carry all the pockets are stitch
welded to be waterproof but the pockets
are only half the story we invented a
design method called DWD the
differential weight distribution which
ensures the coat feels empty even if you
pack it full of gear in other words
carry all that stuff and feel like
you're carrying no stuff pretty genius
what else oh yeah the safe back thanks
reasonably price presenter ever got
stranded at the bottom of a mountain and
needed to be pulled up apricot people
did then they came up with say family
have built in life-saving harness that
can carry up to 400 pounds
if you're strong enough to pull of
course Africa is waterproof and
windproof it's meant for real
adventurers not a kiddie playground tool
when you're a real adventurer sometimes
you get lost that's why we partnered a
good spot the world's leader in GPS
trackers just press this button and your
location is sent to a helicopter or your
mom yeah and the GPS never runs out
because apricot also has a built-in
solar battery yeah they thought of
everything while you wait for rescue
enjoy apricots built-in inflatable
pillow mmm that's good nap in' hey now
presenters in a city man this coat looks
great everywhere and on anyone oh and
the beer to demonstrate how strong our
materials are we wanted this man to find
a beer but apparently a real beer costs
a lot and we wanted to invest more in
the coasts we even only spent a hundred
bucks on our logo it was run by this guy
thanks Nathan look out for the bear ha
ha good stop so now you're excited
you're thinking this coat looks amazing
but I don't know you guys how can I
trust you so I guess you and the branded
coat managers are regular golf buddies
no you're not and we don't play golf
it's boring we just really care for this
coat we spent a lot of our time and
money to make it a reality because we
tried many other coats and just weren't
happy now
APRA coat is finally here
so a few love adventures and want a coat
you can trust that comes with an honest
price tag get apricot
