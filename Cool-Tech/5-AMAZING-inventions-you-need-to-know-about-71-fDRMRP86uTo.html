hi I am Jung I'm a boat builder and the
inventor of pública I really like
sparkling water but I also like the sea
and as former environmental science
student I realized that it's not a good
combination because of the plastic
pollution of the Seas so I decided to
get the soda machine but it was too big
for my small kitchen so i omit the
bubble

convenient and happy and make the
environment protection a pleasure bubble
caps saves your money counter space and
the environment so if you agree that it
is a good idea to save the environment
