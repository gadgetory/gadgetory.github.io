everyday lives but they can put us into
risky and tricky situations or require
someone else to help gange those lengthy
distances but here's a change by back by
tech New Age India now you can get out
of that risky spot and don't eat a
helping hand to determine long distances
vhat measures and not one but two
directions from one press of a button
you can acquire the left-right and total
value at once saving you precious time
and energy on every move and allowing
you to work with greater efficiency by
making you the focal point also your
measurements can be instantly updated to
your smart device with our sketch
application where you can design and
plan for any projects VHA knees
additional functions enable you to use
continuous measuring mode to find mid
points
pythagoras function to reach heights
and calculate the area and volume of any
spares in life made easier

we sought to create something more
special and started by reimagining your
classic everyday shape we began
developing designs out of our workshop
in San Francisco and brought these to
the only place in the world that could
bring our designs to life Japan a
manufacturing culture known for
precision reliability and durability
where production is truly art the
Japanese have a same show Queens which
means mastery of once craft we journey
to a small coastal town 300 miles
outside of Tokyo this place is home to
the first pair of titanium frames ever
created we partnered with a team of
Master Craftsmen and a year ago we went
to work but great designs can't just be
tested in the lab we brought our
prototypes everywhere with us so that we
could try them out in the real world we
made adjustments and improvements to our
designs the materials we use and the
engineering required to bring it all
together we wanted something we were
proud of something we were confident
we are ready to launch our line of
sunglasses with two truly distinctive
styles veil and valor
vail combines a classic silhouette with
a low-profile design valor is
constructed entirely of high-grade
titanium featuring this season's most
sought-after flatlands look both
sunglasses can be paired with any of our
three lenses our standard Japanese smoke
lenses are polarized smoke lenses or our
proprietary blackout lenses the first
the world has ever seen
they go from a dark yet comfortable tint
in the shade to a much richer and darker
hue under the Sun giving you a distinct
look that no other pair of sunglasses
offer today while still providing you
with crystal-clear vision your pledge
will help us fund the first production
line and get these sunglasses into your
hands this summer
thank you for your support
second crafted with confidence
people want to be creative but they
don't always know where to start
that's why we provide curated projects
each month with the materials and
instructions you need to get going
every month you get an interesting and
unique project to build one of the first
projects will be building is your own
USB video game controller every month's
project is different for example one
month you could get a conductive sewing
project so you can make a sock animal
that when you put the hands together the
eyes light up your box will contain
crazy circuits components and anything
else that you need to complete the
project for that month we will provide
written instructions and video guides to
help you through each project no matter
your age or skill level crazy circuits
is the ultimate inclusive system works
the conductive inks and paints
conductive threads conductive tapes and
there are a ton of great companies out
there that make these types of products
we're partnering with these companies to
bring you the best of the maker world
one month to get a conductive ink pen or
Bluetooth controller another month
you'll get specialized Lego components
all compatible with our crazy circuit
system you don't even need a soldering
iron if you can so snap stick or click
you can use crazy circuits
one of the best things about crazy
circuits is how it scales based on your
ability level you start by making simple
circuits and activities and move on to
robotics and Arduino projects wherever
your imagination takes you to meet our
pricing and quality goals we need a
solid base of subscribers that's where
you come in we want everyone to become a
builder a maker and inventor to go from
I don't know - look what I made we want
people to have fun with crazy circuits
and we can't wait to see what you come
up with
you
you
