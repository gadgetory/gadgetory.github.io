that helps you organize your pills and
seconds and remind you in to take them I
need to take certain vitamins every
single day in order to stay healthy but
I always forget to take them with le
grid I could receive reminders when it's
time to take my vitamins and I don't
even need to think about it because the
lights tell me which ones to take and
how many we designed le grid to make
life easy for people that take vitamins
supplements or medications this is my
grandfather he's usually always having a
good time however last year I walked
into his apartment and found him
shivering unable to speak or move so I
grabbed a blanket wrapped him up and
when I was finally able to find out what
happened he told me he hadn't taken his
medications in three days he said it was
because it takes him so long to organize
his medications in his weekly container
that he sometimes doesn't do it and as a
result he doesn't take them so we
designed le ready with ella grid each
compartment contains one type of
medication so whenever you're running
low you can simply take your pill bottle
and pour and more now it takes my
grandfather 30 seconds to organize all
of his pills instead of 30 minutes which
means he actually does it I'm going to
be honest my mom she's not the best of
technology which is why it's so great
that I can set up her alley good forward
all I have to do is tap on the rectangle
put in the information about what
medication she's supposed to take and
when and it saves right there on the
device I don't have to mess with the app
again neither does she I can know that
it's reminder ticor medication no matter
how far away I am my dad and I live
nearly 4,000 miles
from each other so it can be hard to
keep in touch with him let alone keep
track of his general health and
well-being but thanks to elegance
onboard sensors I can receive
notifications when he doesn't take his
medicine so I don't have to keep
guessing I could reach out to my dad
whenever he's struggling to make sure
that he's okay stories like these are
not uncommon which is why we've been
developing le grid for the past year
we've gone through a series of tests and
prototypes to make sure the LA grid
looks and feels great and make your life
easier than ever the product has come a
long way and now the technology is ready
to put into the hands of every person
that means one but we can't do without
you if you can help us reach our funding
goal by pre-ordering an elegant and
supporting us in any way we can provide
this product to you and those who need
it the most so what is le grid worth to
you or better yet who is worth it to you
I think any dog owner can relate to it
you look into their eyes and share a
brief connection and see that they
really want to understand so when you
think about trying to talk to your pet
there's really only so much you can say
but what if somehow you could
communicate more what would you ask them
first this was the inspiration for
clever peg clever cat is an interactive
device that reward your dog for solving
simple puzzles we know that when your
reward an animal for performing a
certain behavior it's more likely to
perform that behavior again in the
future we use this every time we try to
get our dock to do something for a treat
and to the most important factors in
making this work a repetition and
consistency so clever pet uses your
dog's morning meal and the time it
spends at home to encourage interactions
throughout the day it starts out simple
your dog will get a treat whenever she
presses any of clever beds buttons once
she's got this down clever pit makes her
job a little bit tougher now she only
gets a treat when she presses the button
that's lit up once she's learned that
the game changes again clever pet
gradually teaches her to interact a more
interesting ways and she stays active
and happy all day long the really great
thing is that this is all automatic
clever pet engages your dog even when
you can't count my favorite part about
working with dogs is seeing progress on
a daily basis I've learned a lot about
how dogs interact with their
surroundings and the most important
takeaway is that a dog with a job as a
happy dog what's really interesting is
that all my clients have the same
request they all want a happy healthy
and well behaved dog so when I was first
introduced to clever pet I learned that
there was something for these problems
keeping our dogs engaged and busy while
we're not at home I've introduced dogs
to just about every interactive toy and
device on the market and nothing
challenges your dog like clever pentose
we began with simple pet behaviors and
have since advanced some more complex
interactions at clever pet we're driven
by compassion and curiosity to find a
way to care for pets when they're alone
and get a better sense for who they are
so whether you're looking to keep your
pet healthy and happy or simply dealing
with your dog's anxiety when you leave
the house clever pet adapts to meet your
dog's needs clever path engage idle

technology is a part of our everyday
lives it's our communication media
consumption navigation and much more
it's with us when we wake at work and
during our leisure time technology isn't
transforming our lives it is our lives
as fantastic as our technology is drones
smartphones tablets there are some
inherent limitations to the devices in
hand with that we have you find saw an
opportunity to enhance your interface
with technology by both free in your
hands and offering a second screen
experience it's going to be 62 that is
why we invented the view find hands-free
wearable display you find is a
high-definition wearable display that
seamlessly integrates with your existing
technology simply plug any hdmi source
into your view find and power up the
display imagine hands-free navigation
easy-to-follow instructions for free or
vision to pilot your drone more
effectively you find is more than a
second screen it enhances your current
technology truly unlocking its full
potential I'm Doug Lee view finds cheap
product designer a year ago we launched
view fun on kickstarter raising over
four hundred eighty-two percent of our
campaign goal and ultimately we
delivered our first product that view
fine to all of our 14 hundred plus
backers now we're back on Kickstarter to
share our next model with the community
introducing the view fine plus the next
evolution in wearable
place the be fine plus is a result of
the direct feedback we received from the
view fine community taking your input to
shape the design and new features of the
most noticeable enhancement we've
increased the viewable screen size to
accommodate a wider range of devices for
landscape viewing we've increased the
screen size by thirty three percent her
device is displaying in portrait a full
seventy-seven percent increase so now
you can see your screen more clearly
with greater ease no matter what you're
connected to all so new to view fine
plus is a full compatibility with any
device capable of outputting a 720p hdmi
signal further simplifying our
plug-and-play ethos no apps require no
settings to adjust and last we enhance
adjustability the docking station
utilizes a ball-joint greatly increasing
its range of motion to ensure you the
best most comfortable viewing angle
we've designed view fine plus to further
enhance technology that is a part of
your daily life phones drones cameras
and tablets are wearable display freezer
hands and unleashes the potential in
games video footage viewing pictures
everything from following along in a
yoga session navigating a street
hands-free and heads up finding that
perfect shot to simply enjoying a movie
and that's just a sampling of the uses
our backers have shared
now to thank the Kickstarter community
for everything you've done for us we're
back to give you the first opportunity
to purchase the view fine plus at the
kickstarter exclusive price $179 thank
you for sharing your time with us today
we look forward to hearing about the
creative uses you discover with the view
fine plus where it will display
you
imagine a world where dreams meet
reality
where digital meets physical
humans eat connection we spend huge
amounts of our day interacting with
others around us but often when we look
around us we find the current technology
is individual focused we miss out on
real life moments here at h plus we
won't change that alice is a tabletop
holographic display that enhances your
life and invites connection it is a
central place to sink any type of device
and to display its content from all
sides you can play games with family
connect across generations work together
cooperatively or compete head-to-head
make education and engaging experience
or something so natural as sharing and
displaying we wanted to make something
with as many viewing angles as possible
to get to where we are today reiterated
hundreds of times we've settled on a
design that's beautiful strong and safe
it has an eco-friendly monitor and it's
tempered glass as a coating that is
specially designed to reflect a specific
amount of light for optimal display
quality USB and HDMI ports allow devices
to connect and display on the hulls from
jess you miss controls like leap motion
the brain senses and a 3d printer we
have tested them all with the hollis can
our adding more connection options to
make the Hollis more natural and
intuitive to interact with making the
holes combine lots of different software
and hardware makes it even more complex
that's why we have assembled the best
team possible to do just that and are
encouraging more great programmers
develop content for the holes once it is
released we have unreal and unity async
is available and are adding more
middleware support in the future
connection is important to everyone
you've gone as far as we can go without
more support and need your help to take
us to the next level we are so excited
to bring the hollis to life and get it
into your hands I want to play baseball
in our space I want to see fireworks
from Mars but can we come back of course
hollow world
let me pick you
you
I was thinking a job
man to hold
was wrong
I
I'm
love love love love
if it really
you
