take a good look around you you will
easily notice creations that are crafted
with precision and perfection their
design connects intimately with our
feelings and body contour thus catering
for our desire and behavior among these
creations many are technological
innovations to our regret some of these
creations are fading out
one of them is MagSafe after
considerable time and effort in research
and development we resolved to resurrect
MagSafe a genius design by Steve Jobs
but we don't stop there we adapt
magazine to the functionality of modern
gadgets
making it the only design on the market
that encapsulates three technologies
MagSafe USB C and Thunderbolt three
this means with only one connector and
one port it can provide superfast data
transfer and high-resolution video
update it recaptures the comfort brought
by magazine at the same time retaining
the benefit of USB C and Thunderbolt 3
for all your USB C devices also on the
team is a renowned manufacturer whose
expertise was recognized in many other
successful Kickstarter projects such as
pebble time and Dropcam they help us
ensure quality and feasibility so why do
we call ourselves magazine maxi stands
for magic continues it is our aspiration
to bring back the magic of Steve Jobs
and to continue his dedication in
empathetic and human focused designs we
hope to take our next step with you
support us and breathing new life in
MagSafe claim your discounted price by
clicking back this project make your
pledge now and we will see you on the
other side strength balance flexibility
