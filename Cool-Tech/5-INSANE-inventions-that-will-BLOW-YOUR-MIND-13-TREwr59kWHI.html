many ways but it hasn't really been
applied to outdoor and camping equipment
until now this is the world's first
outdoor smart lantern for both - tech
first I hope you agree that it looks
great your granddad may have taken you
camping but your equipment doesn't have
to look like it the lantern can be
adjusted here but it can also be
controlled by a Bluetooth app on your
phone at the end of a long day outdoors
you don't have to keep getting up and
down to adjust the lanterns brightness
you can do so from wherever you're
seated you can adjust it to a range of
16 million colors to suit your mood or
later you can even turn it off remotely
without getting out of your tent or
sleeping bag that's great when the
weather is breezy or you have something
else to do have you ever been hiking and
had trouble finding your tent now it's
easy just set your life to flash but at
otech we have gone much further the
lantern comes with built-in weather
sensors temperature humidity barometric
pressure it will even give you weather
alerts our smart Lantern comes in two
sizes the 200 lumen and the powerful
four hundred lumen that illuminates to a
range of nearly ten paces at full power
it will last eight nights at low power
13x the lantern is strong durable and
lightweight it is water resistant so no
worries wood spray on a boat with full
batteries even the 400 L is just over
three pounds or 1.6 kilograms it also
has a built in tripod for uneven
surfaces and the handle it won't break
it uses rechargeable batteries or more
d-cell batteries you can even use it to
charge your mobile phone or other
devices because it has a built-in USB
port oh - tech is developing a number of
other smart camping devices
two years ago we set out to change the
way backpacks are used we redesigned
everything every steam buckle and we
released Joey and you loved it
all your support inspired us to
challenge ourselves even further so we
started thinking about today's wallets
let's face it wallets are either bulky
and uncomfortable or way too minimum so
we came up with something new to combine
ten crafted traditional materials with
an innovative design meet Jin Jin has
just two compartments you can access
everything you need in one swift motion
the stainless steel clip can hold ten
cards twenty bills for any combination
of the two so there's no wasted space
coin it has a pocket that holds
everything from coin to key to USB six
we've also given Jin a concealed drawer
so the small items you need to keep safe
oh and once again we've got your back
Jin comes with an RFID blocking mode so
forget about your information being
stolen everything about this wallet thin
and light we make out of leather or
microfiber so you can choose the style
that's right for you Jin's is tiny but
it's got room for everything you need
everyday everywhere
this is our second campaign and once
again we're ready for production we just
need your support
make it happen from our whole team here
at koala gear we want to thank you for
bringing gin to life
brewing this passion passion for
ingredients techniques and tastes and
for every batch the skill is added new
elements recognized reacted on and not
necessarily improved but understood we
wanted to understand the process in
detail that's why we develop Plato Plato
is a reinvented airline if the tool
could be a Brewers the tool that
continuously monitors the ongoing
fermentation process it measures the
beers gravity and temperatures gives you
a unique insight in the fermentation
activities at any given point and
calculates to the alcohol content
without touching the beer to whatsoever
knowing the amount of co2 generated
during the fermentation allows us to
calculate these key parameters Plato is
designed to optically measure co2 flow
through the glass clears frightened
airlock making it truly non-invasive
data is gathered calculated and sent to
the online clouds using Wi-Fi Plato
gives you more than just instant and
historical data it analyzes the ongoing
fermentation and generates or reports
you need for every single batch
share discuss and analyze the data to
increase the understanding of how
temperature changes mastering techniques
or strains of music affects the
fermentation and patience
play-doh doesn't make beer for you let's
you understand
over the past few years the smartphone
has become the single most important
communication device that we use on a
daily basis no matter where we are we
need it to stay in contact with those
around us
however smartphones are entirely
dependent on a communication
infrastructure that they use what
happens when this infrastructure becomes
unreliable or is non-existent for
instance when we are out in the wild
traveling abroad when there are too many
users congesting the network or when a
natural disaster locks down existing
cellular towers that's when we created
the sonic a wireless communication of
ice that enables your smartphone to send
for instant messages voice recordings
image data and GPS locations even when
there is no internet access or cellular
coverage how does it work simply connect
your smartphone to the Wi-Fi access
point on the phone app and it will
transmit the data sent from your phone
to other sonic users via long-range
radio frequency no cellular data no
satellite service and no monthly
subscription the typical range the
point-to-point communication with the
sonnet is approximately five kilometres
for three miles
it also supports mesh networking that
can dramatically increase the detective
range by securely relaying data to other
SONET devices in the area the sonic is
designed specifically for use in the
outdoors it is rated ip66 meaning that
its dust type and
water resistance the sonnet is powered
by a four thousand milliamp hour battery
that allows you to use it continuously
for up to 24 hours as a built-in USB
port so that you can even charge your
phone with it on the software side is
the sonnet app an intuitive instant
messenger that draws upon the familiar
user experience in addition the solid
app comes with useful features such as
offline map and real-time location
sharing so that you always know where
you are in relation to your friends in
the case of an emergency
the stone adapt has a panic button which
will activate the SOS mode broadcasting
your distress call and your current GPS
location any sonnet users in range we've
been developing the sonnet for over a
year now and are super excited for
possibilities prototypes are now
complete and we're ready it's moving a
full production that's where you come in
we're looking for your support to bring
this form of decentralized communication
into the mainstream
Isana is just the beginning and we're so
grateful for you to be a part of it
thank you for your help</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
