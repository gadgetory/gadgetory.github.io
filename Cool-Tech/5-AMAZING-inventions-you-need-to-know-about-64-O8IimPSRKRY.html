have its drawbacks like finding out
where you're going and sticking together
that's why we created go telly go telly
is a GPS tracker using long-range radio
technology go telly creates its own
Network go telly allows you and whoever
you're with to locate communicate and
stick together during no matter where
you are go telly can run on its own for
up to two days on a single charge and
and be used on its own without the need
of any other device to record and track
your location down to one meter a cruise
when paired with a smartphone you can
use the app to view and track group up
to 30 units go telly is able to allow
users to communicate via text to others
in
even send an SOS signal when control
giving you that peace of mind of being
able to be there when needed
go Telly's network is also able to be
made in your own home monitoring loved
ones and making sure they are safe
within the app you can also make an
electronic fence once a goat le device
crosses this invisible thing you will be
alerted on your smart device this can be
helpful when you need to be able to find
and track those sometimes like their
venture off by themselves sometimes we
just need to know if someone is ok and
go till he makes a need to venture out
with the security of always being able
to find your way back home get a goat le

breathing is the most natural and
important thing we do and every day
almost 3000 gallons of air fill our
lungs air is everywhere where we live
where we work where we sleep but do you
really know what's in the air you
breathe you might think that pollution
is only other side but it's the complete
opposite many studies have proven that
indoor air is up to five times more
polluted than outdoor
that is why we created Theory Cleary is
the most amazing natural air purifier
powered by real plans that helped people
in reducing indoor air pollution and it
will be the best design object you will
ever have on the market right now there
are only traditional electronic air
purifiers made in plastic very ugly big
and bulky and in other words thanks to
filters this is why we thought about
something revolutionary and we created
the perfect synergy between nature
technology and design the hottest Clery
work we designed a smart flower pot that
amplifies the natural properties of fans
our idea started from a research of
Nazareth they found out this compound
suppress ability to eliminate
propagation the problem is that a single
plant isn't that effective so we created
a technology unit that allows more air
flow through the soil and the roots this
is where the filtration happens we use
plants as biofilters roots and soils
generate colonies of microorganism that
crept and filter the toxic agent in year
in a natural way
clearing sects filters 93% of toxic
agents immediately it's very silent and
has a very low energy consumption less
than 50% other LED bulb you can manage
it with your smartphone and the best
thing is that there are no filters so
you don't have to change them and waste
money what happens inside is not magic
but a synthetic sex and we proved it we
did many researchers and prove the
effectiveness of Cleary at limber
one of the most important research labs
on plants in Europe and peanuts a
spinoff of the University of Florence
based in Italy
Cleary is loss of toffee an Italian
design products we work hard for years
design it in every detail we develop
some multiple sketches and prototypes to
make the designs perfect we presented it
at PA 2015 and had great respect we have
a super team with two brilliant
industrial designers and a great advisor
team that helped Italy has a long
tradition of Crossman especially in the
ceramic film this Italian culture is an
inspiration for us we use a ceramic
first for this critical quality but
mostly because it's eco-friendly and it
doesn't release any toxic agent in the
year obviously we also work really hard
on a technology part of our product we
came to the silicon valley to make
something really powerful with developed
our technology working close with
engineers and manufacturers in the
Silicon Valley to improve the
functionalities of Clery thanks to a
technology unit in our smartphone app
with health and air quality sensors
clear is able to track the soft
occasions in year and give you real-time
solution and led analysis of it and also
temperature in the emitter to monitor
Larry lives with you telling what's
wrong maybe allergies sleep problems
productivity asthma it learns about you
and cares about you
it works with Wi-Fi so wherever you are
Larry can give you healthy tips on how
to feel better and tell you if something
is going wrong please backup product
Phil is a working professional just like
most of us whenever he goes on a
business trip he takes all his digital
pals with him and he needs a bunch of
cable to keep his pals going but one day

for his iPhone or iPad the original
power adapter or even a USB hub by the
way with magical you can connect your
iPad to your laptop and turn it into an

never worried about the storage on his
smartphone because you can transfer
pictures or videos to a flash drive
anywhere at any time with manageable

efficient also magical charges faster
and transfers faster too with the 24 odd
copper wire inside Mashable charges 150%
faster and transfers 30% faster than
most regular tables the premium nylon
