life can be smelly
that's why you need venti fresh the best
weapon to take out stinky odors it works
let add in ventilation to your trash can
another closed spaces freshen up the air
so you can actually relax when it turns
into this guy it keeps a spill in this
area a lot more toilet
and it makes sure that you can smell the
sweet scent of this little devil right
here rather than this you can install
fancy fresh to your trashcan easily
within seconds just leave it alone no
maintenance it's a high-tech ventilation
system combining UV lighting and
platinum dioxide technology to break
down odor molecules and yield fresh air
a light sensor starts through the
organization when the trashcan is closed
venti fresh adapts to all kinds of trash
cans and you can use any regular garbage
bags
there's no consumables that keep you
spending more and with an additional
portable power bank you can use vent
fresh all around the house such as
treats in the fridge when needed under
the kitchen sink and of course your
smelly shoe cabinets so go get a fancy
fresh so easy to install and 100%
hassle-free a task that I call clean job
this is Darrin the CrossFit enthusiast
while he has the energy to do 500 squat
thrusts wearing a lead vest he somehow
lacks the energy to rinse out his
smoothie cups this is Cheryl from book
club she prefers her novel Stevie and
her Merlot from a box as her wine glass
will surely a test
this is sweet little Georgie he likes to
drink and burp up formula from his
favorite bottle here they're all
wonderful folks but they leave a trail
of hard to clean cups glasses and
bottles it's why we created the first
wave glass rinser the solution to the
age-old problem of dried on gunk just
press downward and high-pressure water
jets upward powering away remnants
before they have a chance to dry the
glass Ritzer is also ideal for washing
narrow items like bottles and champagne
flutes in a home bar you can use it to
pre rinse clean pint glasses or mugs it
was designed and built by the people at
first wave the Innovation Lab inside
Delta Faucet company it installs in a
standard countertop hole so if you have
an open spot after installing a new
faucet or if you want to replace an old
soap pump it's an easy upgrade order
your first wave glass renter today for
yourself or for them
penultimate the pen just got mightier
designing penultimate has been an
interesting journey thus far we've gone
through at least two dozen different
prototypes its each one a little
different than the last it's been really
interesting to adapt that technology to
those people's preferences you know
going to the trial another reason this
is so exciting for us is we're taking an
instrument that's so traditional but
innovating it making it exciting again
please
penultimate quick-draw stand transforms
it into a functional piece of art it
kind of adds a swordless dome type feel
to it
it's a very practical product but at the
same time we're gonna make it beautiful
and appealing to the eye we really thank
anybody that's willing to back up this
project we really like to give it to the
world we really like to continue to
develop this and our backers are the
people that are going to make this
possible that are gonna be able to bring
this to fruition and we hope that you
have as much fun using it as we did
working on it penultimate
