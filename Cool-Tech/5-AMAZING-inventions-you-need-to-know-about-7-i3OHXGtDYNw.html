Treadway and I am CTO and co-founder at
Acton actin is a company that designs
and manufactures personal transportation
we are introducing a longboard the likes
of which the world has never seen carbon
fiber pressure cast aluminum extruded
aluminum cnc cut we are using for hub
motors all-wheel drive people all wheel
drive the one that will get you up most
of the steepest hills in America and
around the world
but wait there's more if you're looking
for something a little more affordable
we got you we have two more models what
we call the blink s and the blink s2
it's a different construction than the
quattro it's made of wood but it has
aluminum extrusion along the bottom and
an aluminum plate on top to kind of
sandwich the batteries inside of the
deck so there's actually a hole that
goes clear through it the s2 version of
this board is a little bit longer than
the s and that's because it has the
extra motor it goes a little faster and
just needs to be a little longer for
more stability
you
so you get to choose from three boards
you get the Quattro or the blink guess
or the blink s2
you
now we're releasing three products at
the same time here so of course this is
why we're on IndieGoGo but we have
finished the development on these and we
have of course factory minimums that we
need to meet and that's why we're here
and that's why we need your help help us
out and get yourself onto an active
board and glide uphill into the future
of personal transportation thank you
you
are you worn out from all the hustle and
bustle of everyday life sometimes all
you want is just to have a rest but it
seems like you can escape from all the
noise surrounding how can we get some
silence into our busy lives introducing
Muse Oh a revolutionary anti-vibration
acoustic device Muse o is the first
device that applies anti vibration
technology for smooth surfaces the
dedicated neo magnetic system is the
soul of musa powered by billion sound
technology music can generate dynamic
realistic sounds while canceling
vibration these vivid sounds set the
scene and drown out intrusive noises we
design music to be streamlined and
balanced it allows muse 02 generate an
even vibration towards the attached
surface with the tpe material music can
be stuck and reposition done to any
surface you can turn every area into
your own personal place give Musa a
gentle touch and you will be able to
feel the magic a magic you never would
have imagined coming out of a sound
device oh just control user with your
smartphone switch on the serenity mode
and enjoy some relaxing time
there been times you weren't worried
people around you can hear what you are
saying by switching to the secret mode

speech privacy even when out in public

hardships of everyday life switch to

field Musa will then minimize the
disturbance and start to decorate your
bedroom according to your preference you

beginning they can also control all
kinds of connected devices with simple
gestures it's very useful when Alex on
his bike and can't focus on anything but
the road or when Lisa is so busy working
doing stuff that she just can't touch
your device's just like them anytime you
want to do many things at the same time
bixi can help it's smart seamless and
easy well easier than cooking apparently
no need to stop doing what you're doing

interact with you can even switch from

device to another with a simple gesture
told you it was smart
and because bixie is full of surprises
it also lets you control your
environment believe me that's something
you will like well you know almost
everything now so what are you waiting
for
hey Kickstarter I'm Jay I'm Daniella
four years ago we started go tended to
solve the no service problem we set out
to make it possible to use your phone
even when you don't have cell reception
or Wi-Fi after a lot of hard work we
developed this device which is the first
and only way to use your smartphone to
send text messages and GPS locations to
others over long distances even when you
don't have any service of any kind our
award-winning product has been enjoyed
by tens of thousands and used all over
the planet while adventuring outdoors
traveling abroad attending crowded
events or even during an emergency over
the last year we've been working on a
next-generation product it lays the
foundation for a kind of communications
network that has never existed before
and now we're finally ready to share
what we've been working on and invite
you to be a part of it has this ever
happened to you you're traveling with
friends and burst his garden and
everyone has a different adventure
planned for the day mean wants to climb
a mountain and take pictures David and I
don't want to find a river and enjoy the
Sun and you you just want to find a ride
height spot bison fun because you don't
go to purchase garden without trying the
right height spot the problem is my
phone has no service and purchase Scott
and I still want to know my friends are
doing that's why in this adventure we
each brought a goat in a mesh once
paired with your phone Goten EMES
generates its own radio signal so you
can send texts and GPS locations using a
simple app no towers routers or
satellites required sent and received
I can send a direct message of David a
group chat to my friends or Brad cast to
any Goten in the area go tena has great
point to point communication range but
with this groundbreaking mesh networking
technology is possible to double or
triple your range by hopping through
other go 10 ms units in the area you
don't even need to know the other users
or do anything it's automatic and
private so I'm able to receive a message
from Ming who's on top of the mountain
because our friends and other go 10 ms
users act as real life points between us
imagine using this at a music festival
or on the slopes the possibilities are
endless unlike traditional communication
networks goten amesh actually get
stronger the more users joining we call
this people power connectivity one more
to go please
we're excited to launch Goten amesh
because it's the first mesh network of
its kind one hundred percent off grid
mobile long range and consumer ready
this kind of technology has never
existed outside of the military and even
then they've been big heavy systems that
cost tens of thousands of dollars Goten
amesh however is tiny and affordable
goten amesh is our first product
available internationally and having
completed industrial design and advanced
prototyping earlier this year we're now
busy testing and setting up
manufacturing and distribution so people
all over the world can use our
technology to stay connected to each
other during fun off grid adventures as
well as unplanned emergency situations
it's worth noting that go tennis
technology has already fielded and
trusted by public safety organizations
during mission critical operations which
means that you can count on it too in
our headquarters in Brooklyn New York
we've assembled a small but scrappy team
that includes some of the most talented
engineers in the world we're all
motivated by the mission of empowering
people to create their own connectivity
even when traditional communication
networks are unavailable unreliable or
unaffordable we've built goten a mesh
because we believe in a future where
communication isn't just delivered by
top-down infrastructure but also make
possible from the bottom up by people
like you we want you to be the first to
experience the future of people powered
connectivity it starts with enabling
essential communication when you don't
have service but it can be something
much bigger we've built revolutionary
technology into Goten amesh but in order
to change the game we need you
Kickstarter we invite you to become a
mesh founder with us so please support
this campaign until everyone you know
about gettin a mesh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
