these days children my smartphones
tablets and handheld devices a much more
attractive to them than watching TV an
addiction to the use of the devices is
not a healthy prospect either party or
mind think about this issue we came up
with an idea that there should be a more
positive interactive device for children
introducing the beggar AR projector it
is our belief that great idea come from
quick camera such as great media and
this camera should be adorable cute
inovative and a nurture a child's
imagination this is our agar it looks
like an egg but your child it could be a
monster or at first a monster and now a
pretty girl and before it was a pretty
girl by in rarity it's a boy
although at first it may seem like just
a toy we have developed this way to
preserve a child's innocence agar was
built with our consideration for the
older children such as knowing that
children are naturally sensitive to
light so we have scared projection
brightness down to 100 lumens to ensure
a child's comfort and safety
agar also supports a smart lighting
system which automatically adjust its
brightness depending
it's irani agar is tailored for children
so it's very easy to operate with our
safe contact charging system using
magnetic pole connector technology
offering simple fast and safe charging
operation even while charging agar
remains of cool and cute intuitive and
versatile agar is made for children to
enjoy with just a few case of operation
which is demonstrated in the design of
Agra remote controller our sincere hope
is that there could be a screen tailor
designs our children</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
