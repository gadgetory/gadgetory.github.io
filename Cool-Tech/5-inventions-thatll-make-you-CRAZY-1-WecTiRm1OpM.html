submergence and is also lightweight for

travelin it's one of the most
rewarding things about being aligned
holding around bulky luggage not so much
traveling is supposed to feel like an
adventure but most of the time your big
bags just get in the way they're costly
to check at the airport you end up
having to wait around for them and they
may even get lost or worse stolen and
for what to spend a good part of your
trip lugging around a bag stuff with
dirty clothes you didn't even need
anywhere well what if there was a better
way to travel what have we told you you
could travel anywhere in the world and
you wouldn't need anything more than a
small carry on backpack hi IndieGoGo I'm
Dan and I'd like to introduce you to
unbound two shirts two pairs of socks
and two pairs of underwear that will
drastically reduce the amount of stuff
you pack wherever you go that's because
our clothes never smells and we stay
clean and fresh even if you wear them
every single day in fact I've been
wearing this shirt here for four to six
days in a row famous of socks and
underwear now I know what you're
thinking but these clothes are just as
clean and fresh as the first day I put
them on that's right over a month of
putting these clothes through everything
from wearing them day living the office
out to dinner one to bed even the gym
and most importantly it's what I took
with me as I recently traveled to China
and Thailand we're a two-week trip like
that the old me would usually pack two
weeks worth of clothes that's a lot of
stuff but with unbound I can travel
light fast and free because I have less
stuff how do we do this merino wool
merino is an absolute game changer and
excels over cotton and synthetics in
every single way if Nancy bacterial is
odor resistant it's a natural body
temperature regulator keeping you warm
when it's cold and staying light and
breathable when it's hot and it quickly
posts right away from your body where
can evaporate unlike Cod that absorb
sweat where it becomes a breeding ground
for odor causing bacteria until now
Marino has traditionally been used for
sporty looking high performance
activewear which means it's not the type
of stuff most people want to wear out /
gym it's also really expensive
we took all the benefits of Moreno and
use it to create stylish staple that fit
and look great for everyday use simple
and versatile clothing that could be
worn for a stroll through the market or
dressed up and worn out for a nice
dinner and because we're cutting out
retailers and selling directly to you
we're able to sell our merino shirt
socks and underwear for a fraction of
the price unbound Moreno is a travel
hack of all travel hat say goodbye to
checking luggage we're waiting at the
luggage carousel or warn about keeping
your stuff safe and say hello to what
travels all without the ocean and
drinking from a coconut for the past
year we've been working tirelessly with
designers rolfe farmers and garment
makers to make the perfect travel
program we secured great manufacturers
but in order to make our minimum order
quantity we'll need your help the
prototypes have been finalized and
tested and everything's ready to go as
soon as this campaign in having said
that the production run will cost us
thirty thousand dollars and we can't do
it without your support we hope you'll
support our campaign Cheers
you
e
you
you
ah
you
and
you
you
undo and untie attach the next drop dig
it to the mirror start grooming need to
stop hanging straps to the hole all done
still the training from the trash repack
and you are now the king of your car
speeding responsive man fear the beard
