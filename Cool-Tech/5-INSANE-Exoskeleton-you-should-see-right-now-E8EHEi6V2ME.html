what you're looking at could be the
soldiers uniform of the future the
not-too-distant future this is the
exoskeleton now being developed by
Raytheon company's newest research lab
in Utah the XO is a robotic suit that
gives its wearer greater strength
endurance and agility
just like the superheroes depicted in
comic books and Hollywood movies think
of the exoskeleton as an amplifier
Raytheon engineer Rex Jamison says it's
easy to use oh it's very natural you can
get it today
walk around no problem I like the the
quick movements like the speed bag and
playing soccer with it and some of the
power stuff it can carry 150 pound
payload we walk up ramps and walk up
stairs which you know I couldn't do
myself raytheon-sarcos a leader in
advanced robotics is developing the
exoskeleton for the US Army the suit is
a combination of sensors actuators and
controllers all packaged in this
futuristic design dr. Stephen Jacobson
heads raytheon-sarcos and his project he
believes invention is a combination of
art science engineering and design
people call it different things
sometimes they call it venting sometimes
they call it engineering sometimes they
call it being a mad scientist whatever
but it's it's thus it's the process of
getting together understanding of
problems goals and then designing
something to satisfy the need with the
exoskeleton Raytheon is not only
satisfying a need the company is pushing
the boundaries of technology to where
science fiction will one day meet
reality
you
I'm Sophie Morgan an ambassador for Rex
bionics I'm going to be explaining as
well as demonstrating but many functions
that Rex is capable of as well as
showing how easy it is to transport
having been using Rex for over a month
or so I am very confident transferring
myself in and out unaided I'm a level t4
complete following a car accident ten
years ago but it's possible to use Rex
with the levels up to c4 to transfer I
simply open Rex's legs I can position my
chair next to Rex and transfer myself
into the exoskeleton once I'm in and
seated as far back as possible are then
fastened straps around my shins and
thighs until they're secure but not too
tight to avoid too much pressure also
the pads of soft and flexible and can be
detached and washed I transfer using
this method but everybody is different
it is possible to use a hoist or
assistance to transfer once I'm ready to
go I just hand the joystick and select
the stand function by simply moving the
joystick upwards
Rex ven stands up it's important to lean
forward as you stand in the same way
that an able-bodied person does when
standing up there are a number of
different functions that Rex can carry
out let's start with the walking by
simply selecting walk from the list of
programs actions I can begin to move
forwards or backwards with a walking
pace reduced to a third of a typical
walking speed the stability is increased
and I feel more secure and safe we have
found and I agree but most people
certainly don't want to go any faster
than this walking backwards is important
as well because it allows me to stretch
my hip flexors which gets tight over
time from sitting in a wheelchair Rex is
the only exoskeleton that is capable of
this function Rex is also able to turn
left and right this can be done when
stationary or on the move this is useful
for navigating smaller spaces that well
might find in everyday
life such as in the office or at home I
can also raise the armrest which leave
my hands completely free for more
important things while being stable and
balanced it's also possible to shuffle
from left to right this is particularly
useful for negotiating smaller spaces
and helping stretch my hips whilst I
benefit from dynamic weight-bearing
activities each Rex comes with two
batteries that can last the two hours of
continuous walking and use no charge
while stationary the batteries are very
easy to change it only takes a few
seconds it can be fully recharged in one
to two hours so you should never be
without power for Rex Rex is also very
portable it is easily placed in a
vehicle either lying down flat in the
back or with the knees bent and in the
back seat
once purchase a consultation is given as
well as three to five days of training
to really get the most out of wreck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
