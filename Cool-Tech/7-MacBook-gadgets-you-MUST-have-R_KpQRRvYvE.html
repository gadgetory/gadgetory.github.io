your computer's user account your
Facebook Twitter Instagram or any other
website online accounts that you
previously would lock onto the password
and all of it with just one touch you
can use much stronger and longer
password 12 or more symbols without any
problems just put your finger on the eye
touch ID and you're in you don't need to
worry that people around you your
classmates colleagues business partners
buddies your wife or husband would see
your password your private photos videos
documents and any other information will
always be protected
we all remember and love the MagSafe on
Mac however the new MacBooks no longer
haven't innovations shouldn't be making
it harder for you to charge your laptop
so we designed a device that brings back
the convenience you've gotten used to
introducing snap enabled
charge all your gadgets in a snap it's
compact and durable once you try it
you'll never go anywhere without
snap inator may even save your computer
max sake is back this time not just for
men our team of engineers and designers
have been specializing in electronic
badges for 10 years
place your order today you can expect
your snap inators each get them right on
time
snap needs the Snap feature is back
you
you've got the hottest new computer but
now you can't plug in any of your stuff
your new MacBook shouldn't make the rest
of your Hardware obsolete and some
things just can't be connected via the
cloud introducing hub plus connect all
your devices to the new macbook hub plus
is compact and durable so you can take
it with you charge up your phone no
matter where you are we developed hub
plus in palo alto and designed it with
our team in germany our manufacturers
are on standby and if you back us today
we'll be ready to deliver on time +
select Kickstarter backers will even
receive a bonus mini adapter hub + ports
power portability
you
this is digital storage not the digital
storage you're used to this little guy
sits inside your macbook doubling your
onboard storage
this is TARDIS 256 engineered to make
your macbook 256 gigabytes bigger on the
inside this is the future of macbook
storage TARDIS could make space for all
of your photos music documents movies
and memories and captures it all in a
safe place when your macbook fills up
you don't have to choose memories to
delete the genius of TARDIS is its
simplicity all you have to do is insert
and TARDIS does the rest
not only as TARDIS the easiest way to
double your on-board storage but for
many Mac books it's the only option I'm
Pierce from the TARDIS team and we're
located here in Boston we're working out
of the AI lab venture incubator we have
spent over a year working out ways to
improve macbook storage my name is
Pierce Schiller I'm here in the
beautiful city of Taipei Taiwan
working to try and get a manufacturing
run going just had a really successful
meeting with a group of very ambitious
manufacturers yesterday I met with a
chip company everything is going
according to plan a lot of people who
own MacBooks run into the same problem
storage space runs out most quickly
learn they have purchased a virtually
non upgradable machine Wired magazine
released an article titled the new
MacBook Pro unfixable unhackable
untenable we teamed up with an
international semiconductor manufacturer
to create 256 gigabyte chip that is
faster than a traditional USB external
hard drive tardis integrates all this
speed and stored inside a unibody
aluminum chassis just like your math
book instead of manufacturing overseas
we set up shop a couple towns over and
over in Massachusetts giving us the
ability to oversee a streamlined and
fully automated production finally
upgrading new MacBook is possible in
easier
over the past year we've put everything
into prototyping and making TARDIS
possible let's begin production we need
your help
invest in storing the future invest in
tar disk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
