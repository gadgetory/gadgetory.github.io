the market of climate equipment on the
one hand there are plenty of absolutely
inefficient small devices that don't
prevent suffering from heat on the other
hand there are other five bulky
solutions that consumes all the energy
they require complicated maintenance and
to be honest not always provide you with
desired level of comfort I don't know
about you but I would like to have a
device that combines portability of
desktop gadget with efficiency of modern
technology meets next generation of evil
polar smart personal air-conditioner
this multifunctional device group
humidified and purifies the air creating
a perfect microclimate around yourself
7-pole is easy to use as one to screen
fill the water tank adjust the fan speed
in direct evaporative water evaporation
it literally creates these natural
refreshing breeze one can feel as the
Seacoast and I found the dryer hair and
skin report produced moist and taking
care of your house and beauty everybody
has their own temperature of comfort and
optional humidity level this is
definitely not something that central
air conditioning systems respect also
cooling effect spread unevenly and those
who are close to an air conditioner
always through to port and others always
still to call during the summer season
fully air conditioned spaces become
unbearable and regular heat wave make it
much worse even best climate systems
often can cope and you need some extra
cooling power
either polar makes me feel comfortable
in any condition improving your
productivity and helping you to achieve
more the core technology behind the
report is a breeze especially developed
operated metamaterial based on minor
another paddle
this allows Singapore to be both compact
and powerful unlike traditional
materials have a breeze doesn't contain
any organic element this prevents
bacteria and more stretch we're always
there is no pre-owned or any other tech
support
this makes have a smaller technology
absolutely safe to use and eco-friendly
thank you ever polar is a truly smart
delight it confused less energy than
life saving bulbs significantly reducing
your bill with a variety of tools for
automation smart home integration and
application control ever polar will
easily become a natural part of your
office of home ecosystem we are founders
of ever polar here you go we came to you
with the idea of personal air
conditioner we are grateful for support
of thousand bakers who helped the dream
come true we didn't let you down
delivered product in a record time and
now we are ready for the next chapter of
our journey the most valuable thing for
us was your feedback it allowed us to
spread the boundaries of Climate
Technologies even wider in this new
advanced device we believe that climate
technologies are becoming personal and
we invite everybody to join the service
and once again thanks for your spot
you
