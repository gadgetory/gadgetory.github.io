you
we are mouths and we've designed a phone
case that can do dicks this is quite
scary I mean is my iPhone 7 ready
it goes and they look like this
we found that slim phone cases weren't
that protective and protective phone
cases are ugly so we designed a lot of
phone cases carbon fiber one metal ones
curved one wooden ones leather one you
name it we designed it and we tested
them on real iPhone some survived all
might wear tailoring this some didn't he
go expensive but in the end we did it
introducing limitless
by mouth
a slim phone case with serious
engineering that hasn't compromised on
looks Walmart bamboos black marble black
leather matte gray Kevlar carbon fiber
this is London's Waterloo Bridge higher
up here than I saw it was a 35 foot
drawn here we go
not even a scratch how because we've
engineered an advanced impact material
aero shock it's inside all our phone
cases this unique polymer contains
thousands of micro air pockets absorb
the impacts of all bearing the drop some
regular plastic bamboo but on arrow
shock the energy is absorbed the same
thing happens in our phone cases all our
cases are seriously protective so
protective we've dropped it from a crane
onto concrete from 45 feet
all our cases have a steel plate built
into the back and they come with a free
magnetic wall mount of the backers they
fit both the iPhone six and seven so you
don't have to upgrade your case the same
applies for the six plus and the sevens
loss here you can see our tools making
our cases using our own material
hopefully head up the IndieGoGo right
now and get your cake
you
welcome to centrist the makers of mic
port Pro and other fine audio products
if all you've ever heard is music from
your phone with earbuds you don't know
what you're missing it's time to take
your phone to the next level but how do
you do that you can get another battery
an external d/a-converter
an outboard amplifier anybody to get the
portable components you will still end
up with something like this how cool is
that really now here's the real deal
imagine a phone case that includes a
killer audio rig and an extra battery
it's like a skin for your phone we call
it high five skin it makes your music
and videos sound clearer and louder you
will instantly get better sound and a
longer-lasting battery and it's from
Syndrome the only personal audio company
featured on the cover of stereo file it
sounds really good it's really
well-balanced good clarity sounds really
great hi I'm Michael Goodman from
Centron we're here at the Tokyo
headphone set and central's has three
things for the iPhone it's a protective
case it's a DAC and it's an amplifier
it's a high resolution amplifier that
lets you listen to pretty much any
headphones because the higher power
higher quality amplifier than what's
available in the phone it's got a switch
to match different headphones it will
charge your phone it's got a battery
built-in it will amplify the sound of
your phone it'll route everything
through its internal DAC so it takes the
sound out of the phone digitally and it
will extend the battery life of your
phone you'll be able to take this with
you on a transatlantic flight and have
uninterrupted music playing throughout
the whole thing I really love this
product I am very excited about it we
have a version for iPhone 5 we have a
version for iPhone 6 and then Virgin
score Samsung phones are also planned so
they'll be coming out soon it took us
over a year to get this product right we
didn't want to disappoint our customers
we made countless revisions and
improvements until we were satisfied
with a performance audio quality battery
capacity looks and many other features
now we have working demos and are
starting to order production parts help
us bring this product to market faster
and get a great deal on a great product
