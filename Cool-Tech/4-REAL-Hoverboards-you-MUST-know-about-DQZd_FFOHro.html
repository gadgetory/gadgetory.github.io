you
you
how do you engineer an experience when
you strip away everything weighing you
down holding you back you begin to float
away weightless hovering this is the
hoverboard the essence of pure motion
captured refined and reinvented the
hoverboard translates your will into
motion a single point of contact with
the ground minimizes friction and freeze
your movement from a linear path inside
precision sensors and electronics smooth
and stabilized you arrive gently
accelerating in whichever direction you
leave the controls are intuitive gently
apply pressure to one end of the board
to accelerate lean gently to one side of
the other to turn in that direction when
you stop you can set the board down on
its side to dismount the electric motor
powers a top speed of 20 miles per hour
perfectly balancing safety with
efficiency at every turn in my first
company I had to figure out some way to
pack all the control electronics and the
drive electronics into the motor itself
I succeeded in doing that and we called
the product the smart motor that really
poised to me perfectly for making the
ultimate personal electric vehicle the
hoverboard moves you but it's also a
part of you with endless personalization
options to make your hoverboard a
perfect fit for you built-in speakers
pair with your smartphone giving you the
perfect soundtrack for your daily
commute or weekend Joyride on board
lighting gives you visibility at night
letting you ride a cloud of light to
your destination the hoverboard is
perfectly balanced in both form and
function it's fully electronic whisper
quiet and amazingly efficient the
high-capacity battery takes you 15 to 20
miles on a single charge and the best
part it's not just an idea we are riding
the experience today thing that sets the
hoverboard apart is that it really does
take skill to operate it's an earned
experience you have to get in touch with
the nuances of the hoverboard and once
you do the reward is a gliding kind of
willful experience that carries you
where you want to go
the hoverboard is an ultimate form in a
new class of electronic transportation
connecting us to our world in a way
we've never experienced before
as of this moment that we're shooting
this video there are only six people on
the planet that can ride a hoverboard we
all have one thing in common we cannot
stop writing it so we want to find out
how many other people share our passion
for the hoverboard and we've set up our
Kickstarter reward tiers to reward those
people the most who sign up first so if
you're as passionate about public words
we are back us on Kickstarter and join
us in taking your first step into the
future
Oh
Oh
you
what's amazing about one wheel is the
experience of riding it we combine the
motion sensing technology from a
smartphone the motor and battery
technology like you find in a Tesla
create a self-balancing electric
skateboard controlled simply by leaning
your body we started with a dream of a
hoverboard the smooth feeling of flying
over pavement inspired by this vision in
the future we created an incredible ride
that feels like a natural extension of
your balance one wheel is designed to be
intuitive whether you're a pro are never
been on a board you can learn the basics
in under a minute and there's plenty of
room to challenge yourself by riding
more aggressively or inventing new
tricks there are no hand controls you
just lean toward your front foot to go
faster and your back foot to slow down
or even reverse regenerative braking
kicks and as you come to stop at the
heart of one wheel is a state-of-the-art
direct drive brushless motor in the hub
of the wheel movement and balance are
achieved by a custom controller the
reeds gyro and accelerometer sensors
thousands of times a second the
high-speed charger gives a lithium
batteries minute to minister we made one
wheel unusable and dynamic experience
and unlike skateboarding where you feel
every little crack and pebble and Street
one wheel feels a lot more like surfing
or snowboarding a large tire and
carefully tuned algorithms allow you to
carve the pavement as if it were water
or fresh powder I remember as a kid
watching back to the future and just
dreamy what it'd be like to be on a
board floating above the street every
time I want a one-wheel I think about
that it feels like just flying down the
road it's this wonderful feeling of just
stepping on this thing and thinking
about where you want to go and you're
off you lean very much like you do in a
snowboard you just kind of lean into the
turns you want to go on and one wheel
just kind of carves for you it's a
pretty magical experience it's like
taking that mountain laying it out flat
every street becomes like a fresh powder
run we've invested five years and a lot
of money building countless prototypes
to get one wheel to where it is today
everyone who rides it loves it and with
your help we want to make one wheel
available to the world we've worked with
all kinds of manufacturers on other
and we believe the u.s. is the best
place to build an advanced products like
one with us but that kind of quality
costs money so we need backers like you
who share our vision of creating amazing
electric vehicles with your backing will
pay for tooling costs and build the
first ever one wheel production join us
in revolutionising the experience ride</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
