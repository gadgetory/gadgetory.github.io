600 million people who get behind the
wheel of a car every single day at
seventy-five percent of them used very
smart phone while driving hello
kick-started my name is Ivan and today
I'm extremely proud to introduce
Hardwick line it is a simple smartphone
accessories but turns his smartphone
inka head-up display just like in a
fighter jet or luxury car we've been
working on improving safety and
confidence the driver for three years
started with a navigation act which
transforms our vision our home cell
phones can be used in cars by now over 1
million drivers and try our and one
customer even told us say he's like
other glass was inspired by round
arranging when you are driving 120 miles
per hour all your dashing focus on the
road ahead to look away even for a
second is extremely dangerous put in a
head-up display in the race card wanted
but we realized regular drivers face of
the same instructions and more using
this platform for driving we put it to
the test the two most common
distractions are reading directions of
the phone and checking it parameter this
causes to drive blind for approximately
300 feet on every mile only difficult
10-mile trip we are distracted and
driving blind for over half a mile using
odd request the distraction time is
reduced to nearly zero head-up displays
encouraged to exist already but they
tend to be very expensive and usually
found only on luxury vehicles some
companies are developing more affordable
devices but they still cost several
hundred dollars and a stock in the midst
of a very long and complicated
development process so you still cannot
buy them today and hard way we take a
think way around let's face it your
smartphone already has everything you
need to take down and reach you they can
do i display GPS internet census the
only thing is missing is a special
object class to providing high quality
reflection of the screen there and I
rain or shine well we all the technician
isn't anymore imagine that you already
have had a display in your car all you
need is just an accessory for your
answer imagine all medication
information is in front of your eyes all
the time imagine music controls
conference calls or catching up with a
robot friends period there are no limits
you can use any app on any smartphone
that supports head up
play mode now there's no need to take
your hands of the wheel or your eyes of
the road it's a safer and more
comfortable right what do you think
about that I feel like I'm gonna Syfy
movie wow really cool i like it i like
the reflection and it doesn't block your
view of anything did I can you give me
the options it does not have to look
down on my phone every two seconds you
know there are a lot of high-end luxury
cars that have the capability and if you
don't have one of those kind of cars and
you know it's great to have it's
convenient it's easy to use it sounds
like it even saved wise without having
to take your eyes off the road how much
make you oh gosh I don't know it
must be some kind of scam see blast
maybe a few hundred dollars actually
only 49 come on you're in the forty nine
dollars from you here is my cell phone
case I want one that is also that's cool
other gloss is a very dear face

hey everyone my name is Michael Wacha
for some years now I have a problem
every evening and sometimes several
times a day I have to put my mobile
devices on charge and what is the most
inconvenient about it is that the
battery goes out to an average huge
necessity to it's one of them I think
I'm not the only one for the deposit but
these problems i'm pretty sure that
every one of you got into the situation
when one of the latest ran out of
battery the moment we needed it the most
you should not worry about this anymore
because I got that solution the solution
is intense energy this is your device of
unlimited energy it's unlimited because
you can generate it yourself and you can
generate this energy as much as we need
can energy research energy inside of
itself that's why you can use it anytime
you need it and of course you can charge
your device during the rotation of
container just as well and energy is
very easy to use first we need to tailor
in and let it go then just keep the
nation goal it may be a surprise but the
water we should inside the tent energy
device rotates with the average speed of
5,000 tonnes per minute that's why your
smartphone will be charged by aunt
energy with the same speed every charges
from the clock take the hint energy
device with you of the time and your
energy will be safe no matter where you
are invertible and energy is
indispensable for the people living in
the
with limited access to electrical grid
thanks to an energy your energy is in
your hands it's one of the most
effective energy generators and what is
more it looks nice you may choose the
hand energy device according to a taste
or style developing the container G
device we have performed a huge amount
of experiments created a huge amount of
prototype and now and energy is finally
done and ready for production and we
need yourself
by the way and energy device
synchronizes with an app where you can
observe your statistics and also
achieved particular goals win
competitions and get prices before the
gig starter campaign we've made a tour
around Europe to support n energy we've
shown the device to people let them take
a close look edit and use it to see what
it's like human learn about the
impression regarding this experience by
yourself you can get more information
about 10 energy compositor about our
plan on Kickstarter page on our website

we need your support</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
