christmas party my and turned away a
glass of wine because of the sulfites it
wasn't until many years after that and a
long time spent learning chemistry in
grad school that I realized really what
sulfites were and that I had the skills
and education to solve with a problem
for a lot of people
even today there's this artisan field of
winemaking you wake up before dawn walk
the vineyard road get a work with your
hands
and there's something about being
connected to the land that constantly
reminds you like making is a natural
process
I always been told that good wine comes
from good grades and that's certainly
true but after the grapes leaves
vineyard there's a whole separate
process that starts in the winery that
most wine drinkers aren't even aware of
more and more vineyards are going
organic and that's great because that
means less pesticides and chemicals and
our wine but winery still need to use
preservatives to ensure that wine
doesn't go bad during production one of
my first roles with the winery is adding
sulfides the great session or harm and
that's when I realized telling these
chemicals really are that being said I
understand the important role they play
in modern winemaking on an industrial
scale but if I could remove
preservatives from my wine before I
drink it I definitely would
sulphites are an essential preservative
in winemaking they're the reason we can
enjoy wines from all over the world
because without sulfides of wine would
never have survived a trip from the
vineyard here glass but when you're
ready to drink the wine that job is done
so removing cell types of Bulo lets you
bring the wine back to its original
state as if you were drinking it right
at the vineyard this is how Allah works
you pour your wine through and the
sulfites are retained on a filter
material while everything else in the
wine just flows right past completely
unaffected that selective sulfide
capture and it's important because we
want to maintain the original taste and
character of the wide and only remove
that one thing sulphide we know that
aeration can be really important for
line for red wines in particular it
boosts the flavors that are already
there but we know it's not as necessary
for white wine so willow had to have the
option of turning the aerator on or off
why is unique because it works with so
many different settings we can drink it
socially we can have a glass by
ourselves we knew that and designs below
to integrate into a glass carafe or
decanter if you're serving an entire
bottle but if you're looking to have
just a single glass spheres own it rests
on top of your wine glass as well
when developing below we've worked
together to make sure that will always
preserve the integrity the character and
the flavor of anyone I didn't doubt that
it was possible I did doubt whether it
could be done without hurting the line
but now those a reality we can take
sulfides out of wine the first product
to do that and it's a risk i'm glad i
took
five four three two one hi I'm Chris and
on science and we're the creators of the
underwater jet
hey Kickstarter we're introducing a new

what kind of a smaller are you
introducing the silent partner the
world's first smart patch to quiet
snoring noise silent partner is a smart
lightweight and compact device that
elegantly tackles what other products
don't the snoring noise the silent
partner creates a silent zone around the
person wearing it giving you and those
around a better night's sleep how does
it work silent partner uses patented
active noise cancellation that detects
the unwanted snoring sound and generates
a counter sound which suppresses it the
results well it's as simple as a plus

snoring problem they are often intrusive
and thrust the quality of sleep so
