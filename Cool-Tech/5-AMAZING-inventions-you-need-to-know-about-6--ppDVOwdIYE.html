what matters thank you for your support
you
when we're properly hydrated we feel
better think better look better we just
are better level is not just another
fitness tracker it is the first and only
wearable to measure your hydration
letting you know precisely how much
water you need to feel and perform your
best level also measures your heart rate
sleeve quality calories activity and
mood and can integrate all of that
information to show you what kind of
improvements you can see both in your
sleep and during exercise almost all of
us at some point during the day are
dehydrated and those little gaps and
staying up when your hydration needs
have consequences you can lose
concentration and could have an effect
on your mood it could affect your sleep
when you first wake up in the morning
your first thing should for you to go
grab a glass of water you'll find that
maybe it'll need as much coffee and you
definitely won't need as much food water
will level set actually just how hungry
you are so it prevents overeating by
drinking more water you suddenly have
more energy what do you have more energy
for working out and when you're working
out you have better endurance your
joints and your muscles don't hurt as
much and you don't feel as much pain the
effect of that workout is continuing on
throughout the day you're wearing more
calories now that you've done the work
out studies have shown if you were
hydrated throughout the day it's better
for your sleep and you're going to be
more rested so you have to see all of
this as part of a whole what I like
about level is it gives you the data and
says this is how much you need to get
balanced in life
level is designed for twenty-four seven
where and can learn your activity and
hydration habits not only trending them
but identifying patterns that are
keeping you from your best most consumer
wearable devices can only measure a
fraction of the metrics that are
important to us so we focused on
research we turn to the world of medical
devices where accuracy and precision are
tightly monitored now we've developed a
revolutionary red light technology that
can look ten times deeper into the body
measuring 10 times when any other sensor
can all with industry-leading accuracy
we're excited to return to Kickstarter
with level our mission is to
revolutionize wearable health and
performance no matter if you live to
train or trying to live we can't wait to
see what you'll accomplish by measuring
what really matters
our planet has an abundance of water but
most of that water is either undrinkable
or inaccessible one in three people more
than 2.3 billion don't have clean safe
drinking water one in five people around
the world more than 1.2 billion live in
areas of water scarcity every day more
than 18,000 people die from a lack of
safe drinking water poor women and
children walk for hours every day to
collect the water that they need to live
after walking for hours along remote
trails they fill their contains with 40
pounds of water and carry it back to
their village along the same dangerous
track often with young children in turn
sometimes they make the same trips
several times a day just to get enough
water for their family to drink cook
bathe and clean too often the water they
collect is polluted in disease ridden
what if there was an inexpensive
solution that would allow people to
collect clean safe water where they live
directly from the air around them
waterseer uses the environment around it
to extract water from the atmosphere
here's how it works the waterseer
devices planted about six or more feet
into the ground and the dirt from the
hole is tightly repacked around the
device the metal sides of the
underground chamber are cooled by the
surrounding soil wind spins a helical
turbine which in turn spins internal fan
blades that direct air into a
condensation chamber as the warmer air
cools in the chamber the water vapor
condenses onto the sides flowing down
into the reservoir clean safe pure water
can be extracted from the reservoir
through a simple hose and pump because
the sides of the underground chamber are
always cooler than the air waterseer is
always collecting water day and night
even without wind under optimal
conditions a single waterseer may
collect as much as thirty seven liters
of clean fresh water every day and
waterseer works 24 hours a day forever
without labour electricity or damage to
the environment several can generate
enough water for an entire community our
goal is to make waterseer available
worldwide to the areas where they are
most needed for each waterseer bought in
the u.s. we will provide one to someone
who needs access to clean safe water in
developing countries and in
drought-stricken and arid regions where
clean water is scarce help us make water
seer a reality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
