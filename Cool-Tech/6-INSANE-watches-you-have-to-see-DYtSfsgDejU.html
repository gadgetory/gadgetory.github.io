the sound barrier I'm watching that
Kaizen obviously our aerospace
background and our engineering and
advanced design we have a system of four
belts that are driven by four motors and
those four motors are controlled by the
central microcontroller which is
essentially a little made computer when
you look at this watch and you see these
belts they're just sliding past each
other and you just can't believe what's
going on in here and you know it gives
you the sensation of what going on in an
engine it's a kinetic sculpture so also
in the watch becomes alive and it has a
personality and it has an amazing
attraction conceivable sweet emotion and
most watches movements have been
invented to three hundred years ago
there's really not a lot of new
movements that are even developed or
even attempted so a lot of times you
just see aesthetics around mechanical
movement whereas we invented a movement
it's just not a design it's an
engineering feat not much has changed
since the sundial people tell type on a
system that's comprised of a face and
hands we have made a significant change
in how people think of telling time
especially when it's on your wrist so
you have analog watches or clocks and
you have digital watches in class and
ours is a hybrid of the two and because
of that it's something that people have
really responded to it's something that
is really different it's one would say
revolutionary you go to school and you
learn all of these concepts you learn
all kinds of physics and you learn you
know friction of surfaces and all kinds
of different concepts you're not quite
sure what you're going to use later in
life and in some cases you don't use
those concepts at all you're just kind
of moving along with the same concept
and and producing the same thing well
with this watch I really had to pull out
a lot of these ideas and a lot of these
concepts and had to
down equations and you know solve
different equations for for the friction
of components and a lot of testing we
have a electric drive quartz movement
which is accurate to within one half
second per day and we've combined that
with a intensely mechanical movement
that moves the belts around its robust
its reliable and it's mesmerizing we're
just starting you know we own the global
patent on the movement and we are going
to really have fun playing with future
versions of this watch
