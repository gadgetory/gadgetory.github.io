you waiting for introducing kurihama the
black flower Japanese steel combined
with futuristic London design
finely crafted 67 layers of Japanese
steel angular design smooth transitions
pieces of our yet supremely sharp for
inquiring cooking hello I'm Freddie
founder of edge of Arabia we're a small
london-based knife company we have
launched over five knife ranges we have
bombed great acclaim by defined bloggers
and magazine to name a few the wide
magazine GQ for group and molecules
we've used this experience to launch our
most ambitious product ever the Kuro
hammer the black flower this design
makes references to contemporary design
to angularity smooth transition impact
the final edge floral pattern on the
blade is reminiscent of the perfectly
manicured Japanese turbine we carefully
selected a new high-tech Japanese steel
aus 10 from the Aichi Steel Corporation
the au f10 steel is often known as super
steel due to its high hardness the high
hardness means that the knife will stay
sharp for longer and normalized when you
can combine the different elements those
intriguing opposites an ordinary object
can become more than just a tool it
become a piece of art although they look
fantastic the question is how good are
they to use we decided to put our
prototype to the test with art one of
London's most wanted chefs Oleta booth
he agreed to put them to the test
in his Michelin star restaurant Daboo
I've been using it all morning and yeah
very happy for a school about the verge
of Belgravia kuroi Hana knife which is
gorgeous to look at you know okay I can
take my eyes off it you know as much
care has gone into the functionality and
the sharpness the edge has gone into the
aesthetic so copying ability we used
various items to test on from sort of
crisp things like apples or onions to
kind of softer one such as salmon each
time zero resistance just went straight
through the thing you chop a lot
in kitchens and peel a lot of his onions
but simply I want to test our the chive
curls here we split chives him into
about forces literally almost like
splitting a hair or taking something
very thin making it thinner still
everyday items you know bread salmon
onions whether you're a professional
chef for cooking at home these are
things can be chopping you know probably
quite regularly and it is good good to
make the test relevant from the smallest
knife to the largest just just makes you
like that little bit easier when you're
cooking if you've got good kit a little
like a treat to be honest like I come in
the kitchen cook every day you know it's
kind of like you know driving to work in
a Ferrari that kind of thing you know
it's just yeah yes make something simple
you know feel special with Kohana you
can be a Michelin star chef at home
we believe that this is the key to
inspiring cooking instead of a single
chef's knife we have designed a full set
of six knives for this project each
knife is suited to a specific task and
has a specific purpose big is better
versatile for bread for precision
because it rocks and for slicing our
ohana range has been tested to meet the
FDA food safety standards with no issues
identified
what we want to do is bring the physical
experience of using the energy the
impact that you get at a concert or club
into the real world where you can have
it everywhere and anytime you want bass
is really the part of the music that
connects you to the music physically in
a club you get that big energy from a
big sound system if you put on the music
the next day and you just have
headphones on you're just missing that
part whatever music you're listening to
it adds a physical element to it which
is something that you're totally missing
normally in a home listening or
on-the-go environment people are pushing
the envelope of what they can get out of
those big systems what's the way that
they make businesses when we put put the
base on someone's arm and we turn on the
music and soon as the beefcake then they
have this big smile in their face
because it really pulls you into the
music you listen to it but you can also
feel it in your body
oddly no it's just so intense this song
is going like more and more aggressive
sort of on the bass and you wouldn't
think that you know at the same pace and
have you know the same intensity that
the bass that would be able to match it
but it is it's pretty rare so I got the
can feel it kick drum which is nice and
then like you know sustain bass notes
condition and I think that's really the
power of it is the ability to get that
you know tactile physical immersion as
you get with like some bass and yet in
the end it was just fun I didn't want to
take it off you know the baselet has
very high fidelity it matches exactly
the wave form of the bass
first the main challenge was no
technology existed that could do this in
the such a small fight so we had to
create our own differentiate between is
melodic baseline and hard kicks so even
if the music is a melody and a kick in
between you can feel the difference the
drums you can actually kind of feel like
Tom and Kate and stuff I felt but more
was in the room with it inside the base
set is amazing technology we've built
our own haptic engine which takes up
roughly half the space we've got the
other half which is battery to give a
really long play time and we've managed
to squeeze the old points around the
battery and a half to genji so it's
hardly in the room for the out products
and it was a tough job to get it into
this size the base is really designed as
an everyday companion you can hook it up
to a smartphone to a computer you can
hook it up to a laptop or VR headset you
can really use it with anything that you
would use for for listening to music for
playing games or watching movies the
basis designed to be really easy to use
you just plug and play basically there's
no app to load there's no software to
configure ideally in the morning you
leave the how to put it on your phone
your headphones when you commute to work
when you're at work or whenever you want
to listen to music out and about I think
that's when the basics comes in this
actually has a really powerful
energizing impact on you I think it's
going to be great when you're out about
jogging or do sports that it really
elevates you can activate you and keeps
you going
one of the cool things about the basis
is that it hooks up to anything that has
a headphone out of it and so what I
tried right away is hooking up to a
synthesis and you play a bass line and
suddenly you have that physical entitled
eight you can feel the beat of the music
you're creating and if you're DJ you can
also use the baselet to get a sense of
how the music will feel on a big sound
system in a club as well as for music
lovers I'm really making the basic for
myself I want to use it every day and
we're already at this stage I'm really
really happy with that music is
certainly
the most important content in people's
life so whatever chance I have to make
that experience better I'm going to
going to use it and a jump on it I
wouldn't take it off to be honest
