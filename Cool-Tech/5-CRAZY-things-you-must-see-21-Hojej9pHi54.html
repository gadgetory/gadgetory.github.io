let us introduce charges the world's
most advanced universal travel adapter
that also charges your mobile devices
without any additional chargers it works
in the USA UK Europe Australia and over
150 other countries the idea was born
out of the everyday struggle of people
on the go every time I go on holiday I
want to focus on what to wear but I also
have to carry around a lot of devices
but I don't want to think about but I
can't live without when I am on an
important business trip abroad and I
want less luggage but I need my smart
gadgets all these devices require many
chargers that take up half of my face
and don't forget the countless number of
adapters around the world yeah I always
get those confused and there are never
enough outlets in hotel rooms to charge
all my devices at once that never
happens anymore because we have charges
charges conforms to plug scanners in the
USA UK Europe Australia and 150
countries around the world you can punch
a device in any outlet worldwide with
all the plugs conveniently stored inside
charges save you space and the trouble
of forgetting or losing your chargers
the height of the pins is adjustable to
fit any mobile case or protector now you
can charge your smartphones and tablets
at the same time using the two
integrated pins without carrying any
additional chargers charges supports
micro USB lightning and USB see
standards covering the whole range of
mobile devices and smart gadgets great
now we can charge my iphone and your
samsung at the same time it also works
with other devices sharing the same
charging standards
you
charges also has three additional USB
ports to make it the most convenient
universal travel adapter and you still
have the outlet ready to use in addition
we created the charges bank it's a power
bank that charges my phone up to three
times and has a USB port for any other
device it's been a great journey so far
we beta tested our ideas and pack them
into an awesome compact design we built
the PCB and model the design then we 3d
printed and tested some more this led to
the final working prototype that we sent
out to 10 people to test for two weeks
we got their feedback and now we are
ready to go into mass production I love
trap the world I always find difficulty
to the outlets standard each new country
and I visit yeah I found charges and
solved that problem forever I mean it's
so compact and handy I take it
everywhere with me my wife and I need to
argue over who is going to use the phone
charger every night yeah the charger
spell that problem with this duo
charging station and we don't argue
anymore forget the old chargers go
