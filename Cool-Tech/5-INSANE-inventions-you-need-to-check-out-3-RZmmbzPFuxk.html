everyday problems ok all of your
problems
have you seen our parents brush our
teeth can you imagine doing the same
with them it's a dreadful experience for
both us and for them humane max I'm
sorry now I'll focus only on dogs did
you note that 84% of us already have
oral health issues by the age of three
it's like the number one problem for us
dogs that bites I have two toys but they
don't clean my teeth and what's with
these treats I mean they taste good but
do you really expect food to clean food
just beef jerky brush your teeth because
the momma bear grass I can't talk to
friends freely so I locked myself at
home for days man this dog's best friend
and I'm sure they'll find our way
introducing bristly the revolutionary
brushing stick for dogs
it has paw pads cleverly designed for
easy holding with the toothpaste
reservoir and bristle line grooves
bristly perfectly matches a dog's
behavior and Anatomy
hey I'm Petros the inventor of bristly
when I lost my childhood dog Mickey due
to oral disease it was devastating but
that inspired me to come up with a
solution to this crucial problem as
brushing remains the gold standard to
oral disease prevention i developed
bristly as a brushing stick to allow all
dogs to take care of their own oral
health the bristles help to clean teeth
down to the gum line preventing plaque
and tartar buildup in the last six
months over fifty thousand pet parents
have tried her first version and they
loved it their feedback has helped us
come up with a version that's best
suited to dogs needs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
