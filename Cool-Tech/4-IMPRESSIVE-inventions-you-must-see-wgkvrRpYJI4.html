to design the world's first smart sup
our patented ward winning design is
bringing joy to people all over the
world and a lot of them said they would
even like to have a single board just
the self inflation so here we are
introducing seek rewards and the next
step in the evolution stand-up all you
have to do is activate the magnetic
switch let them retire to the back they
go from there so easy all look at this
great exercise and if you're as lucky as
beyond you get to enjoy pretty beautiful
scenery in the great outdoors
and up
that's firstly that's why we came so
close today probably because they fold
up so small that we can stash it
anywhere and that small size comes in
handy again we want to hit the water
faucet in the back of the bar and head
off everything you need is right your
backpack you don't need to worry about a
thing
Sony's hoping the others talk to
category set to become an Olympic sport
why not pumping after all that's the
hard part that's exactly why I don't
love thumbs we must have I work there
I just start it up to continue our
mission of spreading the sport of
paddleboarding we develop the
self-inflating super boards airline
whose technology makes sure that your
eye self is always at the right pressure
in height
as for the board of felt how much
quality means drops the technology that
repeat your board shake three years even
take it on rubber one and our Swiss
quality control guaranteed before your
beginning is perfect and our leash isn't
just for your safety it's also for
carrying a board to and from the water
smart huh the bag you'll be carry your
super boring air in is perfect to toss
in your board fold up the bag and even
store your collapse of the power
but here's the best part new customers
had any experience our new air models
and three beautiful city
who's perfect for the pilot who wants to
get the letter back at along they the
galaxy's very moment of serenity David
Clarke and all out with a reason for
methods of all kinds especially those
who went and measured their stock in the
other if you are
no matter what your preference your
firstborn
he's awesome it'll be weekly for years
so super bored
air did not make just the filming place
it's also making life be one of the
first to feel our state-of-the-art
design will make it all the more
tempting to sneak off and hit the water
for a session
and speaking of sneaking off that's
exactly what I got it I'm off to a board
meeting thank you so much involving our
super boards and as much as we did and
thanks for your support see you on the
water
how many times have you experienced
frustration having those uninvited
mosquitos during your outdoor adventures
in certain areas of the world
mosquitoes are well known for bringing
infectious diseases like malaria or
dengue fever which can be fatal to
people and children at an eco as
adventure and people lovers we have
decided to stop at one for all this is
why we want to prevent youth and new
mosquitoes dr. Lance it is a compact and
portable lanterns but don't let it small
size trick you it is very powerful the
lantern is easy to use controlled by
only two buttons featuring two main
functions
Buhler and lighting as I told you don't
let it start confusing the anti mosquito
Lantern comes with 2,000 milliamps per
hour which translates up to 20 hours of
non-stop uses well champ so how does it
attract a mosquito it's very simple
arranging uses ultraviolet light to
attract them and then electronically zap
them with the wires in the upper section
and if you want to use the lantern in
the outdoors you can easily hang it on
trees or inside tent by using the hidden
hook on top as you can see you just
unfold it and it is ready to be hung or
the second feature is the lantern itself
has three modes up to 200 women to
regulate the amount of light you will
need is different to Mars and just in
case you're wondering yes you can use
both at the same time the killing mode
and the lighting mode whenever the
lanterns becomes dirty and you need to
remove the dead insects you can just use
a small brush and simply brush them off
or you can use water the Deborah mayhem
is highly water resistant
I keep it's waiting there for you can
think it without damaging the lantern
once you take it out of the water you
can immediately turn it on and as you
can see it work impeccable to ensure
that the lantern works perfectly we've
tested it in many different scenarios
until we have come up with a file
perfected surgeon as the one you can see
in this video the lantern uses a USB
port charge allowing you to charge it
and use it at the same time for extra
convenience we want to get written
Zito's and for that we are asking for
your help and your support fill our
warehouse with the mosquitoes that were
loser
it is finally only good way and set
aside
so
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
