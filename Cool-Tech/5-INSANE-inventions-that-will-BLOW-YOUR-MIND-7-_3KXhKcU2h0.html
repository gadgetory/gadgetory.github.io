lucky nose imagine being cocooned by a
pure mist warm gentle and luxurious
Sirius is like showering in the clouds
Wow that was a phenomenal experience I'm
totally blown away I'm pretty impressed
with an amazing shower they say that
it's like showering in a cloud it really
is
Cirrus is a revolutionary showerhead
that elevates the bathing ritual into
the stratosphere our atomizing cloud
maker nozzle technology produces a mist
so fine that it totally envelops you and
by creating a mist so fine Cirrus
reduces water and energy consumption by
75 percent compared to conventional
showerheads meaning you'll see a rapid
return on your investment Cirrus also
purifies the water in which you'll bathe
our easy to replace nano filters contain
three layers of mineralized stones which
enhanced water quality by filtering
impurities reducing chlorines adding
minerals and balancing pH levels each
nano filter lasts two to three months of
use for an average family you can also
choose from our range of organic
essential oil aromatherapy infusers
simply add an infuser each time you
shower for a completely invigorating
experience personally I'm not really one
for the aromatherapy hood my girlfriend
is she says it's like having a spa home
our essential oils are both colorless
and soap free meaning they do not
perfume your hair or body or discolor
the water so how does Cirrus work our
eco-friendly cloud maker water atomizing
technology delivers a consistent spray
by splitting the incoming water stream
into myriad nano droplets creating a
mist medes both all-embracing and highly
efficient well be honest I was a little
skeptical about the water savings but
I've been using it for about a month now
and I've seen a significant drop in
water consumption I can see this thing
paying for itself in no time and Cirrus
does not compromise rinse ability in
fact foamy shampoo rinses out of your
hair easier with Cirrus thanks to its
optimized water distribution I'm really
surprised if anything the shower rinsed
off the shampoo on my hair faster than a
normal shower which really surprised me
because my hair is really thick Pyrrhus
is designed in France and uses Chrome
and white polycarbonate to produce a
stylish unapologetically modern bathroom
shower heads
it's made with standard universal
fittings and installs in seconds it is
adaptable to any bathroom and setup is
both tool lists and foolproof the
installation is the easiest thing in the
world I'm no handyman it took me seconds
to do it if I can do it anyone can do it
I have been managing the complex
logistics of production and distribution
for major retailers and businesses since
I arrived in Asia ten years ago we have
a team dominantly based here in Hong
Kong so we can closely monitor the
development and production processes and
importantly to keep a keen eye on
quality control you can count on us to
deliver on our work so where's the catch
the catch is now I'll take even longer
to get ready now if you'll excuse me
serious like showering in the clouds
