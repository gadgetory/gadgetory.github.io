trains striking bike lanes agonizing
delays meats and truck Martin safest and
wallet personal vehicle ever made like
you we think commuting is a drag so we
went looking for the perfect personal
vehicle that is fast fun and safe to
ride an electric skateboard the fun ones
are huge the smaller ones were hard to
learn and none of them delivered the
intelligence stability and smoothness
that a spare time skater could
confidently ride we realize that the
ultimate everyman skateboard simply
didn't exist so we invented it backed by
the investors who innovated drone
technology powered by the same battery
type of a Tesla spectra if the world's
first and only board equipped with an
ever learning 3d posture control
algorithm that means you can escape
hands-free no app or remote required
what's more Spectras futuristic AI
learns your movements over time and a
judge to give you the smoothest can take
this ride possible if you can walk you
can ride spectrum controlling it with
your feet to go forward and to break
let's take a look at safety when your
child or significant other rides through
traffic you want more than a performance
you want to promise Spectras four-point
security technology covers
as for portability ride to work in style
and store it in the commuter backpack
that's already won the red dot design
award for compact sweetness village the
world's most portable personal vehicle
spectra delivers a solid 90 minutes of
right time at fifteen point five miles
per hour what do we need to make
spectrum a reality we're back in fact
Rubicon is the most intuitive and
exhilarating personal vehicle we have
seen to date now we need a little love
from you so the retailers now that the
climb is right if you're ready to put
specs on the market pre-order the mini
advance pro or silver out of backers
only vision as soon as we reach our goal
we'll begin shipping so you can have it
as early as August 2017 backer campaign
and let's ride into the future
the Greve is the completely new
generation of people thermometer
measures continuously the body
temperature and gives you the old fever
curves and not only a one spot
measurement my name is Lisa I am your
hundred co-founder of coordinate and
parents are pretty very cute children
that pan we know how difficult it is to
know what the right thing is to do when
children have the temperature for
example should I try to keep my child
warm or try to cool it down in this very
moment and how effective was my
treatment excuse engineers and a parent
we put our passion for perfection to the
test and created this revolutionary
innovative device which bring demo
methods to the highest degree it's quite
small I think it's not very heavy it's
light and very flexible I think it
doesn't disturb the baby or the children
I would recommend the decree for parents
because the very minimal investors
possibility to check the temperature so
you don't have to wake up the baby for
temperature control or especially during
the night the advantage of degree is
that you can have a curve of the
temperature so that you can see if the
temperature fallen all is the
temperature is increasing degrees
measuring continuously the body
temperature and then the curve to a
receiving device like a smartphone so
that's for example in the night you
don't have to wake up every hour and
also wake up the child to take the
temperature because the Cree is simply
doing it continuously you can decline
thresholds at which you want to get a
warning you also get a warning if the
temperature is too high or right into
that the end also shows you physicians
and pharmacy near to you and how to
contact them and we did a lot of
research of the size of the ear with
small children with all the children so
we found a solution where we have a
adaption of the device inside and also a
very flexible design so it can be
adapted to nearly every year very
comfortable and convenient so the
children don't feel the divine decree is
the biggest invention in the history of
causing on we developed this device
because our daughter Anna had a reprise
data these dangers are due to very fast
right
in temperature so you just can't he is
coming when you take the body
temperature once in a while you need a
continuous temperature curve to see such
a seizure coming so we decided or we
start thinking about developing the
creature for continuously fever
centimeter and now here's degree the
next generation kilometer continue
convenient and accurate
we're alpine laughs and we make products
that allow photographers to see the
world differently and the capture is
most captivating moment with the help of
people like you we started building our
ideas here on Kickstarter and five years
later we're excited to introduce spark
our most versatile camera remote yet
one device built for hundreds of
different camera bark is designed to go
where you go and has three distinct
triggering wireless infrared traditional
wired triggering and app control the
infrared beam sensor your camera's
built-in sensor allows for ultra quick
setup and complete wireless triggering
so that you can get out from behind the
camera and be in your own photos by
plugging sparking your camera's trigger
port you can also use it like a normal
wired trigger and if you want to quickly
set up a time lapse hold the spark
button down count the number of links
and you're good to go
for a higher level of control use the
smartphone app it gives you access to
the complete set of smart features
including HDR time long exposures and
bulb ramping time-lapse you can even
control to three cameras at once for
synchronized triggering and with
Bluetooth for technology spark connects
immediately so you can get right to
shoot
we launched four products on Kickstarter
and last year we really pull to give
photographers complete control of their
camera after delivering to over 12,000
backers we went back to the drawing
board
to explore how we could do the power of
app control with the ease and speed of
infrared triggers we wanted something
with extremely long battery life yet
nimble enough that we could always have
it with us so we created sparber a
device that is super fast when you read
it but also has the power to take long
exposures time lapses and shoot with
more advanced technique making hardware
can be challenging so your support on
Kickstarter has allowed us to build some
of the best photography gear available
we love being a part of the crowdfunding
movement and we hope you'll join us on
the next step of the journey
