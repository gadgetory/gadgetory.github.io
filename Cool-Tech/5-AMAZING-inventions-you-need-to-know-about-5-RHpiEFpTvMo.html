of people from different backgrounds
such as business design sales in
chemistry got together to build perfect
home and dryer we've all seen them
before in public restrooms but they're
bulky they're loud and very expensive it
took dozens of concepts and prototypes
hundreds of experimental simulations
thousands of hours of craftsmanship and
an infinite amount of patience to bring
you Android a cordless beautifully
designed compact and affordable bathroom
and kitchen home and dryer home dry is
not only environmentally friendly it has
a built-in patented blue UV light to
kill bacteria that even soap can't get
