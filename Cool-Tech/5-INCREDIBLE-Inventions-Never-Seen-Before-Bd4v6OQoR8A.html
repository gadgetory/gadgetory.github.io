what you need is a truly durable cable
that will last a lifetime
introducing the Zender super cord Kevlar
USB cable the most durable cable ever
made
most cords break or fray where the
connector meets the body of the cable
the key to a resilient cable is an
extended strain relief mechanism made
with soft flexible material this
superior design absorbs tremendous
amounts of stress and reinforces this
crucial Junction super cords innovative
design includes three layers of Kevlar
for maximum strength and protection the
exterior jacket is wrapped in nylon and
kevlar woven in a chevron pattern inside
the jacket each individual wire is
reinforced with Kevlar to strengthen its
durability ultra strength Kevlar fiber
is added to the conductor's to enhance
strength and resilience super cords
reinforced cable construction has been
tested by bending the cable 180 degrees
50,000 times this is ten times the
torture that ordinary cables can go
through
super cord cable uses stainless steel
connectors which will not rust like
other metal connectors a genuine leather
strap is included so you can stay
organized in style let's see just how
durable send your super cord kevlar
cable is
many of us face the frustration of USB
cables breaking from a few months of
normal use after one year of development
experimenting with different braiding
methods
trying different quality materials in
thousands of tests we have created the
ultimate durable cable designed with
state-of-the-art technology delivering
unbeatable quality and a lifetime
warranty
zendo super cord kevlar USB cable is the
lifeline you can count on
the proliferation of cheap and easy to
fly drones has triggered a rise in the
number of incidents where the safety and
security of individuals and facilities
has been compromised drones have
infiltrated the security of heads of
state delivered contraband into prisons
photographed private film sets and the
property of celebrities attempts to
protect using conventional weapons have
failed sky wall 100 has the ability to
quickly and easily neutralize a drone
threat by physically capturing a drone
in a net and controlling its descent to
the ground it combines a compressed gas
powered launcher with an intelligent
projectile this portable system provides
a highly mobile and cost-effective
method of dealing with drone threats the
launcher is equipped with a smart scope
to assist in precise targeting the
operator acquires a target while
receiving constant feedback from the
smart scope the on-board computer tracks
the targets flight path and calculates
the required projectile trajectory to
intercept a hovering or moving drone the
smart scope responds forcing the
operator to adjust their aim vertical
adjustments account for range while
lateral adjustments allow the operator
to accurately lead a moving target when
the smart scope is locked on to the
target a solid tone indicates the system
is ready to launch
the only way to completely neutralize a
drone whether it's being flown manually
or autonomously is to physically
intercept it the system can be rapidly
reloaded allowing multiple drone threats
to be quickly engaged by a single
operator sky wall projectiles can carry
a range of countermeasures the sv40
includes a parachute which controls the
descent of a captured drone this
minimizes the risk of any collateral
damage and keeps the drone intact
allowing for forensic investigation and
identification of the perpetrator if the
operator misses the parachute will still
deploy and safely return the tethered
components for reuse other features can
also be included such as audible and
visual alarms and tamper proof marking
systems the system is de-energized when
not in use so it is safe to handle and
transport skywarp captures drones
