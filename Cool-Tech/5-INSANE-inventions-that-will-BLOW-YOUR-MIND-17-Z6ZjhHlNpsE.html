we are Wayfarers the city is our
wilderness and the wilderness is our
city we believe that the outdoors is
worth exploring and that there's no
defined space for it we journey we
explore and we sweat to reach our
destination and let's be honest we're
not going to climb Mount Everest or swim
across the Atlantic solo we believe in
unity and that moments are meant to be
shared so we create tools that are
designed to help us explore that are
strong enough for the woods and
sophisticated enough for the city
introducing the wolf and grizzly grill a
compact stainless steel grill that you
can install within seconds we've
engineered the wolf and grizzly grill in
two parts for simple assembly a frame
that you pull apart and a surface that
you unroll and secure in place and
because there's no such thing as one
fire fits all the WG grill features
three different high configurations a
high position to cook above a wood fire
a mid position for a charcoal barbecue
in your backyard and a flat mode that
lets you use what you have around you to
cook as high or as low as you feel
compelled to compact and weighing about
a kilogram the grill is designed for
easy transport and everyday use and
because of the carefully selected
materials and finish a beautiful patina
developed over time you'll be proud to
watch this reel where in as it becomes a
testament to your adventures
we all have these iPhone cable problems
confusing USB orientations slow charging
worn-out cables and cable set won't
charge overtime
hey low back super cable is the ultimate
solution
hey low back super cable is strong
enough to pull a car and it can bend
over 20 thousand times while an average
cable does 2,000 to 3,000 why is that
because super cable is made from
advanced material with unique design
Kevlar yes the stuff that stop bullets
it's stronger than steel strong is good
but faster is stronger super cable
charges three times as fast as a cable
without MFI certification due to our
ultimate material combination which is a
complete trade secret super cable is
more user-friendly due to our unique
organ ama cosine with our patented blind
plug design you can easily plug in and
get rid of the pain of plug failures
ultimately we advocate a complete
worryfree lifestyle and our products are
designed to reflect it
but lastly this sexy cable is MFI
certified what is MFI you ask well
that's why all those cables in the Apple
stores are so expensive other products
on the market that come cheap won't have
this and they damage your device's fun
now only are we MFI certified and we are
not expensive one more thing we are
confident of super cables quality that
it has a lifetime warranty this will be
the last cable you need to order for
your iPhone we are new at Kickstarter
rewards delivery and this is not our
first cable products we are aiming at
100% on time rate for delivery this time

world's best cable to life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
