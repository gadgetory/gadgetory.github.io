moments different foods we get ready
every day every night we choose who we
are hi Cara the watch the changes with
you
yes a father has high honors and I'm Tom
there are numerous smartwatches
currently in the market that all share a
common flaw to short usage time and
require frequent charges as a team of
designers and engineers we have tested
and redesigned the SmartWatch for a long
time and now we have come up with hajeck
to bring the watch back to the
essentials permanently showing the time
magic is designed to bring you the smart
lifestyle with real time information you
can easily know the weather and see your
schedules and key tunes with business
notifications in the large screen design
brings a more precise touch experience
clear image presentation and perfect
visual display the customized watch face
and person light bands easily fits any
occasion to match your sense of style
magic is equipped with NFC technology

interaction never worry about the
disturbance of an urgent call the
technology of voiced interaction totally
frees your hand without any safety
the built-in GPS module is independent
which means you can locate and navigate
even without internet as well as the
precise real-time heartbreak tracker
supported by powerful sensors we wish to
bring the concept of time back to the
SmartWatch so back up today and let's
start with hajeck
time what is time about
it's about moments in your life
moments of joy and sadness moments of
glory
moments are overcoming the odds
and moments has simply been happy moment
that we sometimes don't even notice but
that later helped to define our lives
should not be forgotten
our lives are like a book of stories
each consisting of such moments each
story unique each one is real and each
one is connected to us there are stories
that stand out and stay with us stories
that connect us with friends and family
and this story is about a man and his
son that live on different continents
yet despite the distance there is
something that helps them stay connected
to a deeper level here in gamblin the
island is in Kamchatka Peninsula and a
worker going around deepening their
first variation of the world but in
store emotions to my life monographs
watch is about emotions about
connections to the people who matter and
the moments spent with them it's about
the time do you want to share with them
and the stories you want to remember
it's a lord achieving abortion and if
the lowered show them that people in
your life the alien comes into you even
when you're I wasn't on my list away
from each other
you can tell financially when you're
very story
so take a step press the button begin
the story Steve the moment the matter
capture them and gather them into
stories curate your life create a unique
pattern of moments on your wrist
associated with each story edits your
story and share it with the ones you
love and see what they have added to
your joint story switch between stories
and the people connected to them the
watch pattern will change when you
switch between stories and every time
you or someone else from your story add
to it
watch how your stories evolved have them
travel with you on the watch and in the
app and shared with those that matter
my inspiration has been to combine the
best of our Swiss heritage in
traditional watchmaking with the key
features of a smart wedge to persuade
the majority of consumers adopting our
wearable technology we wanted to create
a world without compromises the one that
is desirable and will be accepted and
word by majority of consumers the time
will provide a 30 days battery on a
single charge and a water resistant up
to 30 meters when we are starting
working on the design project we knew
from day one that the most critical
challenge for us would be to offer users
your portunity to keep track of the
daily time without necessarily having to
turn on the display and therefore have
some battery life issues this has been
accomplished with the time the perfect
hybrid SmartWatch we combined the best
of both worlds 10 stl watch case and
mechanical hands of an elegant
traditional timepiece with a full color
touchscreen that instantly shows
incoming calls smart phone notification
real time business activity accounting
calendar events daily reminders and much
more right from your wrist the best way
to deliver make any cold hands
experience with a SmartWatch was
actually to use real one but how and how
to make the background of a traditional
watch becoming smart while drinking a
hole into a TFT display was the only
solution we spent countless hours with
our engineering team an inducible
partner finding the right solution to
create a brand-new touchscreen that
could accept the pass-through mechanical
hand solution and we finally did it over
hundreds of prototypes and design
proposal by combining a revolutionary
TFT color display together with the
ultra precise touch panel and a
high-grade quality lab we succeed to
deliver the best of both worlds an
amazing SmartWatch that can operate both
doctrine experience together with the
traditional time period what we didn't
stop here
are how noise we can treat the lowest
level features improve forest
consumption in addition this always
comes with lots of Princeton
applications and the white sir it looks
nice which faces while using the
traditional quartz movements when we
live into a brand new smart world we
were conjunct lee with several partners
to create what we call the smart
movement built around two micro motors
this movement is capable of not only
providing accurate time but it can more
importantly we can control by the watch
ticking you to automatically adjust time
depending on times on where you are and
also move the end where we need them to
be on a particular screen as a result no
clear having hands covering the text on
your emails or messages we can position
them the way we want to deliver the best
reading experience and they will go back
to their original position of the map
having a hollow is horrible to customize
are you it and that it was the highest
level of compatibility for iOS and
Android users this time is also
embedding some of the most advanced
technologies like a three led heart rate
monitoring solution delivering precise
and accurate measures of the cardiac
frequency throughout the day or at a
particular point in time when you need
it we also decided to replace the
traditional crown is a very advent bar
crown helping user to enhance their
navigation experience inside of Polish
and nicely design user interface the
experience will be improved and enhanced
week after week with regular of those
year update offering new watch faces new
applications and first whole new
features the time is with no doubt an
amazing timepiece that will for sure
respect the future of the small portion
industry when I started in early 2013
people know that a web map why would I
start a SmartWatch company in
Switzerland in such a challenging market
it turns out that my vision and passion
had faded as our company has told early
to millions misfortune to death
we have established strong foundations
in Europe and now we are willing to
expand worldwide today we want consumer
to embrace our amazing drawing with the
tight end the first ones to get their
hands on these groundbreaking innovation
as we are heading soon to mass
production
