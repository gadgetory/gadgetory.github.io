let's put it that way that's what he's
been doing for the past 20 years and
he's becoming pretty damn good at it
well I wish this story was all fun and
games but sometimes you gotta take
action to preserve your body Mike's ears
are paying the price whenever he is
DJing and producing he pins fatigue pain
and loss of sensitivity but not anymore
now he uses debug applet let sound in
and keeps noise out ha
what is this debug thing you asked see
but is what saved Mike from imminent
silence and can save a lot of other
people featuring a slider that allows
you to adjust the amount of decibels you
want to filter out debug gives you a
clearer crisper and safer music
experience what's the difference between
d but and a regular ear plug you might
ask well here's some scientific
explanation your ear is designed to
naturally boost frequencies around 2 to
4 kilo Hertz like human speech most ear
plugs simply fill out your ear canal to
block sound problem is that they alter
your years resonance frequency causing
muffled unclear hearing as a result with
D buds you can speak feel listen
do exactly what you used to do our
acoustic mesh is designed to reduce
volume evenly for all frequencies
throughout the spectrum while the
acoustic or mechanically enhances
frequencies in the range of human speech
d-bus simply brings you clear
stays down for Mike this was a decision
that dramatically changed the quality of
his life with a simple slide and he is
telling all his friends about it Rita
strides it to pitch down the high notes
of joyful children and still be able to
talk to the parents
Eden Hall slides it to tone down machine
noise and keep the creative juices
flowing Anna slides it just so she can
hear herself think at the agency and
still be aware of the latest gossip
Samuel slides it to maintain sanity and
focus and make every chance of small
talk a prolific dialogue after years of
research prototyping and testing we
achieved a sleek design plug with
minimum visual impact perfect fits and
reviews this means crisper clearer
hearing with reduced volume every time
we're ear less and our mission is to
bring you a better and safer listening
experience no matter who you are or what
you do back us on Kickstarter and help
us make a difference for millions of
people around the world
dee bud slits downed in

there's something about working out and
the way it makes you feel almost
everyone when tasked would like to have
more fitness in their lives but for most
of us it falls to the bottom of our
priority list so we developed the body
boss 2.0 we wanted a product it would
empower people to reach their goals
where you'd be able to exercise more
often and consistently we want a product
that is compact something that could do
it all with no restrictions this
equipment is something that anyone could
use no matter their fitness level a
product it takes all these concepts from
the gym and combines them into one
solution bringing the gym to you the
platform is strong the posts are spaced
evenly apart on both sides so you can
simulate any exercise and movement and
quickly adjust difficulty the base is
made widen up to stand comfortably
during your workout and we even added a
layer of non-slip material to assure you
stay in place the bands were customized
for this concept and can handle any
height
there's even cloth in the bands to
protect you simply clip in to get
started
shorten the bands or add bands to
increase difficulty our most popular
exercise is squatting with the bar it's
like a workout bar you would see at the
gym but more portable it can unscrew and
it features grip padding for comfort the
ends of the bar spend a full 360 degrees
and are shaped to avoid the clips from
sliding providing you the most natural
feel possible through all of your
exercise motions adding or dropping
bands easily provides many resistance
uppers
we added accessories to simulate even
more solutions such as handles that will
add weight adding bands are like
increasing your weight with the dumbbell
the wrist straps are double padded for
comfort and sweat resistant to stay in
place we even added a door anchor can
increase the workout the body boss is
lightweight made of high-grade injection
molding and capable of handling hundreds
of pounds of force the underside has
non-slip feet for safe use on any
surface the adjustable posts make for
easy storage starting from day one you
can choose your color green pink you can
choose your package and choose how you
want to follow workouts live replay
program all on your own
but by backing this IndieGoGo today you
can get it for a fraction of that price

their goals body boss bringing the gym
