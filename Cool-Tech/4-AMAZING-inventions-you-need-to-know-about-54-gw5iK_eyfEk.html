it as the pinnacle of modern design and
technology but then we saw the iPhone
battery case it's bulky and it looks
ugly just like all the others
we asked ourselves could it be better
the answer was yes
and so we invented thin case thin case
is the world's thinnest all-in-one
iPhone battery case this incredibly thin
protective case adds just 5 millimeters
of thickness to your iPhone it's
extremely durable and offers maximum
protection every case has a raised front
lip that works as a shield to prevent
the screen from hitting the ground when
accidentally dropped on top of that it's
unique design folds out into a kickstand
allowing for hands-free usage any time
thin case is super powerful with 3000
milliamp you have more than double your
iPhone's battery life
that's 14 more hours of video games
movies are talktime and more than 40
hours of music listening and speaking of
listening to music with the introduction
of iPhone 7 you may be missing your
favorite pair of headphones so thin case
brings back the 3.5 millimeter audio
jack now you can charge your phone and
listen to music at the same time just
like the old days thin case is also
intelligent equipped with modern charge
through technology thin case enables
charge and sync functions while
connected to a computer your iPhone
recharges first and then the thin case
recharges itself the LED power indicator
lets you know at a glance how much juice
is left install thin case in a single
click and rest easy knowing your iPhone
will never let you down again

food companies in the world and we did
it with your help

oven sized Imatest in 2015 we shrank the
brewery to the size of espresso maker
and shattered the $1,000 price barrier
with our first pika

even easier more affordable and even
more fun the cost reductions we've
engineered into the platform in the
brewery keg have may be appliance much
more affordable clean up and crew
