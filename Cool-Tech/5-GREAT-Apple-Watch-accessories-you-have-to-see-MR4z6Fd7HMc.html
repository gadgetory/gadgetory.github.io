has it ever occurred to you that the
watchband doesn't always need a buckle
in a loop because it's certainly crossed
our mind being at the heart of the wash
wraps industry for the past three
decades we couldn't help but notice that
all the innovation goes into the watch
itself never into the band even though
it takes up 75% of the reason so we
decided to shake up the industry and
create not just something new but
something that has never been seen
before I gave my team some kind of a
challenging brief the band had to be
simple solid age resistant downright
revolutionary ultra comfortable and of
course Swiss male for months we worked
day in day out until we finally came up
with an idea a patent and a brand the
lab and new moon were born we knew we
want to something bigger revolutionary
is one way to describe the ladder
uncomplicated is another the two half of
the straps simply pressed together an
internal grip reinforces the fastening
system on the wrist while tractive
effort is productive the multiple
elements that all the strap in place for
maximum resistance so in one word the
lab is an Apple watch band that is so
unique in its shape and use you just
have to touch it explore it and play
around with it we got rid of some of the
basics but not everything went out the
window we still meet the toughest
standard and comply with regulation the
elastomer we use called fkm is a matter
here you will normally only find on
luxury watches it does an age it's up to
the touch plus it's highly resistant and
order free no words can describe the lab
experience it samples design the feel
the weight fastened and how you can
express yourself by mixing and matching
colors so get out there and grab your
lab experience the joy of pure
simplicity
the idea is one thing manufacturing is
another that's why we teamed up with the
creative and multi award-winning
designer than Jamie Huber strong on
design without compromising comfort the
lab is one-of-a-kind we want to show the
world that the idea that crossed our
mind a few months ago wasn't just pie in
the sky that the band still plays a big
role in your watch experience and there
is still room for innovation only you
can tell us if this is what's making
let's start the watch band revolution
together
hey i'm scott the founder and chief
designer at minimal the product design
and brand incubation firm based in
chicago in san francisco our latest
projects is called epic which is
designed to provide premium protection
for the new Apple watch
ever since we sparked the crowdfunding
and wearable frenzy with our tick-tock
and lunatic watch kits for the iPod Nano
we've been anxiously waiting for Apple
to connect that brilliant piece of
miniaturised hardware to our beloved
isalus well the wait is finally over and
the Apple watch looks to be yet another
life-changing device that will most
likely become an indispensable and
seamlessly integrated part of our lives
we see this being especially true in
fitness sport and extreme conditions
when we have limited access to our
phones
this is why we've created epic while the
Apple watch is a beautifully refined
piece of hardware those who rely on
their gear while participating in many
of their favorite activities will
require more rugged protection for their
watch leveraging years of designing
wearable technology I've created bold
yet complementary design to protect and
make the Apple watch more functional in
extreme scenarios as well as the harsh
realities of everyday life for a loyal
lunatic watch fans your dream has
finally come true epic will transform
your Apple watch and to a ruggedly
refined wearable companion
thanks for following us on our epic
journey over the years much like our
other crowdfunding projects we honestly
have no idea how many people will want
to protect the Apple watch to this level
so we need your help to forecast demand
and make sure we only make as many as
it's a new product category and we know
it's not for everyone only you can tell
us if this is an epic idea worth making
thank you
you

to face you meaning you can keep
messaging your friends and family
watching your video playing your game
and continuously using your phone for
whatever reason do anything you love
without messy cables uninterrupted
untangled
but mono wear wasn't satisfied with
revolutionising smartphone powering we
also challenged ourselves to create a
worthy counterpart for your SmartWatch
we even designed a mechanism that allows
you to wrap cable up and hide it away
inside the wedge with ease a watch
charger that can be a beautiful charging
stand either on its own or as a complete
unit when seamlessly combined with the
power block when conjoined mono wears
compact shape makes it a breeze to carry
