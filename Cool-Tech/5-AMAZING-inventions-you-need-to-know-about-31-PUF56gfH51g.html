hi my name is Anthony and I'm a founding
partner of mighty audio mighty was born
from personal frustration with the
current on-the-go music experience
several years ago I ditched music
downloading for music streaming the only
thing missing after i switched was a
seamless and integrative experience
during my workout fast forward to today
and every option to stream music still
requires a smartphone while exercising
we all know how annoying it is to work
out with a bulky smartphone phones are
only getting bigger more expensive and
consuming more battery and heaven forbid
if you drop your phone iPod shuffles are
still around but they don't have any
streaming capabilities and let's not
forget the painful syncing process that
requires cords and computers I was
shocked that there was no product out
there that solved my problem so I
thought to myself well no one else is
going to create this product then I'm
going to give it a shot my tea is very
easy to set up thinking music never
requires cords and computers just
bluetooth and your smartphone after you
download the app onto your phone and
turn on the device that will
automatically detect your vice to pair
with via bluetooth once connected you'll
be asked to sign in to your account
after logging in you can sync all your
playlist on to the mighty device in the
same way that you would sing playlist
for offline play on your phone on here
you'll see all your current playlist as
well as how much memory you're using
after a quick sync your music is on your
mighty and you're ready to go no more
phone required at this point we honestly
think the screen is unnecessary we are
proud to be the first ones to bring a
device like this to market or ultra
focus on there's one problem and we want
to solve it elegantly and simply music
is a part of almost everyone's life and
so we want my tea to be the bridge
between your music and your fitness so
if you've been asking yourself why
doesn't this exist please help us make
this product a reality say goodbye to
your smartphones and iPod shuffles and
be mighty
you
