photo first compose the shot
check the histogram adjust the exposure
focus on your subject compute the
hyperfocal distance to keep everything
sharp enable bracketing to get more
dynamic range and a neutral density
filter update the exposure and then take
the shot
we built a better way today's DSLR and
mirrorless camera have amazing optics
and sensors but they do very little to
actually help you take a good photo
finding the right sentence involves a
series of complex techniques and
formulas as an engineer with a
background in artificial intelligence I
knew I could build a tool to simplify
the process I wanted something that
would let me focus on the composition
but would handle the details for me so I
created arsonist the world's first AI
photography assistant with one tap
arsenal fine settings take the best
photo possible Arsenal's AI searches
thousands of images in its database to
suggest good settings next it fine Tunes
the suggestions by analyzing 18
different factors Arsenal uses state of
the art machine learning to help you
take a great photo in any condition
No
many of the memorable shots you see
today are captured by combining multiple
exposures through a labor-intensive
process called photo stacking with
Arsenal you can do this in seconds to
capture all the details and scenes with
high dynamic range get everything in
sharp focus and create long exposures
without buying expensive filters using
these advanced techniques Arsenal lets
you go beyond the limitations of your
camera sensor or lint four times when
you want complete control you can
wirelessly adjust manual settings see a
live preview and trigger the shutter all
from up to 100 feet away
Arsenal also improves the experience of
reviewing photos in the field you can
flip through the photos on your camera
zoom in to check out details at full
resolution then share your favorite
photos right from your phone
and finally Arsenal makes it easy to
capture stunning time-lapse
it automatically adjusts the exposure in
changing lights giving you a smooth
day-to-night transition you can even
watch a high-def preview of your
time-lapse while it's being taken
whether you're a pro who is already
mastered manual shooting or you just
bought your first DSLR Arsenal can help
take your photography to the next level
so before you replace your gear try
upgrading your techniques with Arsenal
Arsenal is already being tested in the
field now I need your help to ramp up
production by supporting our campaign
say you can be one of the first to get
our we've got exclusive rewards for our
early backers and some awesome stretch
goals in the works I'm really excited
about the photos I've been getting with
us I can't wait to share it with you and
see all the amazing photo just movement
this is where it all begins
waves of air particles moving in various
speeds
they are called sound waves and we have
found a way to reproduce them better
than ever before
we are aura a team of scientists
engineers and entrepreneurs with a
shared passion for high fidelity audio
and we have developed a new material
that will change the loudspeaker as you
know it
first let's go back to some of the
bakers a sound signal travels through a
voice coil vibrates a thin membrane
called the cone and voila music to your
ears the quality of sound all depends on
this little got the cone and this is the
actual part of the speaker that's
responsible for converting mechanical
motion into sound and it needs to be as
light as possible most lightweight
materials will bend in vibrate in ways
that are not intended by the music to
create an ultra fidelity experience we
needed a superlight material that's
stronger than anything we know graphene
is a new material isolated in 2004 it
has been dubbed the Wonder material
regime and one of them layer of pure
carbon where the atoms are bonded
together to form a specific for the
motion it is the thinnest material
possible and 200 times stronger than
steel basically the ultimate material
for a speaker cone now we just had to
prove it first we had to come up with an
industrial process to form graphene into
cones and we needed to acoustically
optimize the material for use in
loudspeakers that's how the team came up
with graphene cue our proprietary nano
composite formulation which is 95%
graphene by weight by the way we noticed
one of the smoothest frequency response
curves ever recorded for a headphone
driver and an impressive reduction in
power consumption this was our answer to
the perfect loudspeaker membrane it was
now time to turn our proof of concept
into the ORA graphene cue headphones we
worked with product designers engineers
through many iterations to make sure we
weren't compromising on anything we
wanted them to be practical for everyday
use with an intuitive user experience so
you could have incredible sound quality
on the go we incorporated a gesture
control trackpad on the right cup so you
can control your music without taking
your phone out
there's wireless Bluetooth connectivity
but we also made sure you have the
option of using them wired so you can
always enjoy the best possible audio
experience
these are the world's first graphing
headphones this sound is amazing we're
so proud and excited to finally
introduce them to the world
we have suppliers lined up and a
manufacturing process in place now all
we need is your support to help get this
project off the ground
graphene Q has a huge potential this is
just the beginning
backing aura means you're playing a
direct role in the graphene revolution
this is the first commercially viable
application for this wander material we
are already in talks of major brands
looking to incorporate our technology
inside the next generation of consumer
electronics but with your support or I
will be able to deliver the first
graphene audio experience be sure to
check out our Kickstarter page for
updates and feel free to contact us with
any questions thank you for checking us
out and thank you for your support
dear uncle remember when my friends and
I we had an idea to create the world's
first smart suitcase remember that we
went to you to borrow some money and you
said drop it
is this bullshit what is my suitcase you
warmth
well dear uncle a few things happen
since then we gathered our friends and
family we made a video we went to the
internet and we launched a crowdfunding
campaign we had 10,000 people ordering
the products 10,000 travelling so we
moved to Hong Kong and got bigger and we
slept in factories until we shipped the
product and then ever will receive their
new bags they traveled everywhere they
told their friends and things when crate
here's the fastest man alive
here's Shaquille O'Neal Tony Hawk Katy
neethu even the Pope got work we got
tons of feedback we listened to everyone
and I mean everyone even go late with
the bag we took notes of everything I
kept learning improving designing and
executing to change the game again so
Thank You uncle you pushed us to do
better and here is better
meet Siri - not one but four product
check cabin laptop bag and passport
pouch all connected to our new app
enabling global location tracking
supercharging capability Digital Auto
locking system smart weight sensors
powered by our next-generation
technology to transform the way you
travel the new cabin now 25% bigger
inside charges all your devices
including laptops and the new check
features for smart weight sensors meant
to think with your airline and prevent
you from paying baggage fee both
suitcases lock automatically when you
move away and you can track their
location anywhere
the laptop back charges all your devices
as you move notify you as you leave it
behind
it's TSA friendly expandable and has
every single pocket a traveler needs and
the new passport I'll also connect to
the app making your passport impossible
to forget built with high quality water
resistant materials the best protector
for all of your essentially this is what
smart travel looks like all products
working together as a system to assist
you along the journey
this is Blu smart theory - and this is
us coming back to you our community with
the result of all of our learnings and
an insane amount of work and with our
products ready to ship to you thank you
for watching and thank you for your
support

on creating a perfect mix of design and
technology and here it is in its final
shape packed with super abilities
so displacement your volume in again
well not this time that was a home meet
your personal Superman so what do you
think did they understand they need to
back this projects in order to get
ultimatums of their pockets folks we are
so close to finalizing this project but
we need your help to start manufacturing
voltar man
so back this project today and let's
make this a reality are you in love with
