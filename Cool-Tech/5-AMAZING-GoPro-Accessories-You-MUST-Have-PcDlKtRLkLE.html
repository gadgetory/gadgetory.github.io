portable however most of its existing
accessories are highly targeted toward
specific functions and we have to go
with different accessories and alternate
between them again and again when we
record our trips or any activities can
we find a versatile accessory that is
more efficient and that allows us to use
our GoPro more freely without screwing
unscrewing and positioning the angle the
answer is the slopes elite the slopes
elite has a multi-directional slot and a
4 surface polyhedron bottom it is
capable of docking a case free GoPro in
different orientations both forward and
backward as well as settling at any of
four phases this equates to a generous
16 ways to point your GoPro the setup of
the slopes elite angles was fixed based
on a thorough investigation of the
GoPros visual field now all GoPro heroes
few settings can perform very well with
the slopes elite whether it is in the
super view wide or linear mode with the
slopes elite not only can we get
breathtaking results by positioning our
goal grows close to the ground we can
also get ideal framing when we place it
on desktops or any other surface at a
different height in many cases you don't
even need the back screen or a Wi-Fi
connected cell phone screen for your
framing the slopes elite will always
provide an awesome angle from which to
shoot you can start shooting at once if
you want and with great confidence the
slopes elite is as small as a car key it
weighs only 15 grams which equals three
pieces of a4 paper it can definitely
make your travels much easier the slopes
elite adds almost no extra volume to the
GoPro and shooting it always does a good
job in tiny and narrow places that are
inaccessible for other GoPro holders
this is the slopes elite with it your
shooting will become extremely efficient
your GoPro will be more than an action
camera now you can use it as a 24/7
full-time wide-angle camera and slopes
makes the whole world your tripod

one camera it has a viewing angle of a
hundred and seventy degrees now let's
bring in the 360 euros we need and in
six of these cameras this will allow us
now to be with 360 degrees for asylum
and today most 360 video cameras can
only see 120 degrees vertically with our
360 arrow patent-pending ring we can see
a full hundred eighty degrees vertically
presenting a full spherical view so on
review this in the real world we're able
to see a full 360 degrees horizontally
