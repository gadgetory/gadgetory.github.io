hi I'm Stephen founder and inventor of
sunny Bay
many of us are outdoor enthusiasts we
found this hiring without devices like
the GoPro or wearables lost power
quickly when we use them and there
aren't any plugs around so we came up
with the idea for the excitation it
protects your device or transports and
charges them with the power of the Sun
you can charge your GoPro in less than
100 minutes and it's large loads in less
than one hour at the battery pack of the
excitation you're collecting additional
power on the go we went with the USB
port for charging so you will be able to
charge thousands of different mobile
devices
digital cameras smartphones you get the
idea
we support early adapter so you get the
quality and affordable product for just
69 US dollars including free shipping
worldwide without you we won't be able
to start for the action so please join
us in the one of the first to get the
sunny bag XP thank you
motorcyclists will present about 2% of
vehicles on the road so we created the
first connected brake light to keep
these millions of people safe as
possible
it's called Cosmo connected it's a
detachable and autonomous smart hub an
accessory that combines a rear brake
light and a mobile application our
objectives a lot of motorcycle drivers
to feel more pleasure and freedom on the
road by increasing the level of safety
we developed a product range that brings
many brand new safety features to
writing first Cosmo shines bright red
when writers decelerate with a braking
or not providing a visual warning to
other drivers next if there's an
accident the Cosmo app ensures that
rescue arrived at the scene in timely
manner you detect that the driver fell
and automatically alert emergency
services and notifies the friends and
family it includes GPS coordinate so
they can be found evenly they are low at
night or out in the middle of nowhere
with the app riders can choose who gets
notified at any time Cosmo is
indispensable for protecting users and
reassuring the loved one we worked with
the best designers and engineers to
create an efficient easy-to-use reliable
product that works in all weather
conditions

Cosmo is removable so that battery
charging is easy and it doesn't get in
the way of storing your helmet it uses a
magnetic base glued to the back of the
helmet and this ensures that the brake
light stays on the helmet in normal
driving conditions but falls off in case
of an accident Cosmo has 8 hours of
battery life in standby mode and 3 hours
of battery life fully lit it's designed
to fit the curve of every helmet type
