speak and with that change comes a
constant evolution of capturing devices
go for allowed us to be present in this
world recording her beauty while being
there right in the action drones allows
to take beautiful steady aerial images
from the sky we combine vessel both
worlds and creative air airline should
take aerial videos and photos simply by
throwing your GoPro
hi guys my name is Mark and I start out
there with a couple of friends almost a
year ago what started out as a fun
experiment to get our Gophers in the air
without the use of a drone turn out to
be an amazing experience on its own and
the results they look more alive dynamic
than ever before the feeling you get
when you really throw your gopher in the
air is one that we want to share with
everyone and that's why we are bringing
to you fast
the manufacturing it is all done in the
net alone and we are ready to go the
minute we reach our goal we are very
curious to see what you're gonna do with
their step up your gopro game and back
us today
the GoPro session is an awesome camera
with one exception battery life when I
needed more battery life for my GoPro
session internet searches turned up
nothing I thought there must be a way to
make one
it was 12:30 at night in my office and I
finally discovered a way to make an
extended battery for the GoPro session
working with savoured technologies I was
finally able to get my idea off the
ground I'm excited to introduce to you
the x2 Pro the world's first extended
battery for the GoPro session
the battery in the x2 Pro is actually
twice as large as the one in the gopro
session that just means when you connect
to x2 Pro to your session you'll
actually get three times the charging
space compared to the session by itself
another great feature of the exit pro is
that they charge independently of the
gun procession so you can film with your
session and as soon as it runs out of
battery you just pop it on and you're
ready to go along with the extra pro we
also created a low profile case and a
waterproof case as well no more breaks
no more hassle and no more need to
charge it's been a long journey through
many different prototypes and iterations
we finally can say that that dream can
now be a reality but now to finish the
final stages we need your help so ride
the wave with us and join the team check
out our Kickstarter campaign and spread
the word be a part of x2 Pro
do you love your GoPro but hates how it
runs out of battery so quickly do you
find yourself constantly looking at the
battery level during your adventure I
know you're worried about dropping your
GoPro or damaging the lens every time
you change batteries the Moto wireless
charger keeps your GoPro charged at all
times so you can have more fun with your
camera and focus less on the battery
level
leave your camera safely in its housing
and charge it wirelessly the motor was
charger for GoPro works with all
batteries made for hero3 and hero4 I
love using my GoPro but I dread being
distracted from the adventure that I'm
having and to concentrate on the battery
level or to wrestle with the housing to
potentially expose the lens to damage or
getting it dirty super simple fully
wireless and eliminates the need to
wrestle with the housing with plenty of
power you'll be able to get the GoPro
spare batteries and your smartphone
charged to develop this special
technology optimized for the GoPro
you're going to be able to use any hero3
and hero4 compatible batteries so you
don't need to invest on a whole new set
you're gonna be able to charge your
gopro on the go and be ready to shoot
immediately and finally you're going to
have a spare battery available to you as
well as the ability to charge your
smartphone at any time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
