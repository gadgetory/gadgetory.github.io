years ago
I created Roomba small user friendly
robot that cleans home floors all by
itself
since rumors amazing success I've been
looking for opportunities for other
practical robots I found a great one in
the garden it's called turtle turtle is
a robot that eliminates weeds
it's solar-powered chemical-free and
waterproof everyday it charges itself in
the Sun and one has enough energy it
goes patrolling for weeks my name is
Rory McKean I'm the CEO of Franklin
robotics turtle uses the height of the
plant to decide if it's good or if it's
bad if it's taller than an inch at Leeds
it alone it's smaller than an inch it
cuts it turtle has two methods of
removing weeds the first is a small
nylon string on the bottom of the robots
that spins rapidly to cut the weeds the
second is the design of the wheels as
the robot drives around the wheel scrub
the surface of the soil damaging
pre-emergent weeds turtle doesn't need
to pull weeds because it chops them
every day even if a chopped weed sprouts
again coda will keep chopping it down
until it runs out of store energy and
dies there's no mapping or programming
required for turtle you put the robot in
the garden press GO and the robot takes
care of the rest
turtle uses bluetooth to talk to the
user smartphone there's an app that
accompanies turtle through the app you
can learn about conditions in your
garden and what turtle has been doing
because turtle cuts the weeds every day
the clippings are small so they fall
back onto the ground and travel up
returning the nutrients to the soil to
inform turtle that you want to keep a
small plant you put one of the provided
plant collars around the seedling this
lets turtle know that it's a desired
plant once the plant is larger you can
remove the collar if you like
turtle collects some energy even on
cloudy days and it uses this energy very
carefully
thus it can keep operating through
extended cloudy periods turtle is helped
by the fact that we can't grow very fast
when there's no Sun turtle can easily
cover the typical garden size in the US
which is about a hundred square feet
given favorable soil conditions or sunny
climates turtle is able to cover more
area than that turtle is round if short
it has four-wheel drive and extreme
camber wheels those are all design
choices that improve Turtles mobility in
the garden turtle requires a barrier to
keep it from wandering away from the
garden this could be the edge of a
raised bed of chicken wire fence or some
other type of border we've been
developing turtle over the past two
years constantly testing prototyping and
iterating to make the best product that
we can they launched an Kickstarter
because we need your help to bring
turtle to production with your support
today you can be one of the first to
have turtle in your garden because
weeding sucks you should make a robot do
it with so many devices in our lives the
need for an easy charging solution has
