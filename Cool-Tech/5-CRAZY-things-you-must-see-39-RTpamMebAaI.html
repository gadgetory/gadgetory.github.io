you
you
this is Evelyn she's my best friend I
hate her just look at that gorgeous
straight hair she has and she does
nothing to get it that way
me and Katie who's also my friends just
not my best friend what you know it's
true
we have curly hair now we're proud of
our curly hair
we just sometimes for Furyk straight so
we tried many hair straightening brushes
and heated them all they don't work well
they burn your hair they're just plain
ugly then there's Babu the only brush
that's actually good just a few quick
brushes before I leave the house and my
hair is as straight as I want it and
unlike other brushes it worked perfectly
how come these guys stand and more
childhood friends and entrepreneurs when
they set out to create Vavoom they met
with girls many girls and ask them what
the perfect brush needed then they
created a brush using the girl's advice
is there a lesson here about listening
to girls
maybe ravu is amazingly built the space
between its bristles has been precisely
calculated and measured so it's great
for all types of hair the heating plate
of a voo is bigger than other brushes so
you cover more hair with every brush and
the bristles are arranged in two lines
each with a different height to help
detangle hair and since every hair type
requires a different temperature to
achieve straightness the loop combs with
digital feed control put good one not
like the crap brush is obviously made by
evil men out to torture stand more also
learn that other brushes only have a
heating plate painted with heat
protective colour that's why they burn
your hair so who uses a special
technique that covers the entire plate
with a ceramic coating the tips of the
bristles are temperature protected and
know they won't fall off after one use
and there's also a protective back to
guard your hands on the seat so yeah
paper actually it's just safe Babu's
bristles sit on the flexi plate so it
adds kind of a massage feeling while you
brush I love that oh and it also looks
great if you know style and me we go way
back right Katie damn it Katie you are
so not supportive that's why you're not
my bestie just you want your hair
straight into the matter of minutes with
the best hair straightening brush get
boo-boo
it's the best choice divine is a magical
product that allows us to experience
infinite new world from the comfort of
our own homes
however as game-changing additives
discomfort can be a real issue heat
buildup vigorous gameplay can quickly
spoil the experience we're passionate
about VR and wanted to solve the problem
so we created the vibe in chill
well it's not quite that powerful but
the feeling of relief is the same the
vibe until was designed to be easy to
use effective and maintain a compact
form factor allowing it to disappear
into the headset and let you focus on
first</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
