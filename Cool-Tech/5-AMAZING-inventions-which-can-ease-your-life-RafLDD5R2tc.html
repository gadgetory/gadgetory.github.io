luck or not it's still a mess and a mess
like this can't be clean with just paper
you need water to get the job done right
whether you're cleaning your car or your
hands so why when it comes to that do we
use just toilet paper bathroom goers
meet your new best friend let oh sorry
Pete not you buddy bathroom doors meet
your new best friend the swash 1400 it's
a new seat for the toilet you already
have that will give your butt the royal
treatment it deserves with a heated seat
dual positionable stainless steel
nozzles adjustable warm water spray at
the touch of a button and a warm air
dryer your butt will think you've died
and gone
you get it so what's so great about
brawn dell's new swash bidet seat it's
simple wash don't wipe it uses water to
clean the messes that can't be clean
with just paper he's always doing stuff
like that and with Braun Dells bday CP
10 because it has a citable lid you
think that'd be standard issue with
bidet toilet seats right wrong unlike
most bidet seat lids brondell supports a
person's weight meaning Pete can use it
however he wants another great feature
stainless steel nozzles they're
positionable because they got to hit you
in just the right spot and they're
self-sterilizing I mean they're watching
my butt they're watching Pete's but look
you got to make sure those things are
clean man what's up Pete hmm
Oh
oh yeah that's another feature of
rondelle's new seat it has a nightlight
did I mention rondelles newswatch bday
Sita's customizable memory settings that
means i press one button and get the
seat temperature nozzle position and
water temperature i want i don't have to
remember anything because my swash does
it for me are you kidding me
I think it's pretty clear now to
everyone that when it comes to this
stuff wash don't wipe if you're ready to
change the way you clean click the green
back this project button and pre-order
your very own brand else wash 1400 today
believe me you won't regret it
introducing the meter the first truly
wireless meat thermometer by option labs
cooking meat is a lot like a water
balloon fight if you don't pay attention
be prepared to pay the consequences
this is Derek he loves to cook but let's
face it he's never going to be the Next
Iron Chef wave goodbye to those days
because you finally have the meter a
sleek wireless meat thermometer that
keeps you up to date on your meats
cooking status by sending you
notifications on your smartphone here's
how it works turn it on by taking it out
of the charger open the app on your
smartphone and choose the type of meat
the cut and your target cooking result
stick the meter into the meat push start
on the app and begin the cooking process
now you can enjoy your time away from
the oven or grill because the meter is
monitoring everything for you it's too
often that we're reminded of something
cooking by that all too familiar smell
that prompts us to question is something
burning and you know by that time it's
already too late but when the meter you
get a notification on your phone as soon
as your meat has reached the correct
internal temperature for your desired
cook if you are busy the meter can send
notifications to your friend it'll make
sure there is always someone that can
tend to your meats means it even has a
built-in ambient temperature sensor so
you know how hot it is around your meat
did your smoker drop below 215 degrees
Fahrenheit the meter will notify you now
you can add more fuel to the flame the
meter is your meat bodyguard it watches
you meet and its surroundings to make
sure it's safe from under and over
cooking using the patent-pending dual
sensor system the meter can estimate
when your food will be ready allowing
you to manage your time and do the more
important things unlike other meat
thermometers the meter is the only
connector thermometer that has all of
its electronics built inside the probe
eliminating the need for wired external
devices its innovative design allows the
meters electronics to survive extreme
heat and
completely wireless with a range of up
to 10 meters no more tangle messes are
having to constantly open up the oven or
grill to poke and pry your meat with a
quick read thermometer now that just
sounds painful with the meter once your
food is in the oven there is no need to
check it until it's ready The Meters
probe has no buttons LEDs or openings
allowing it to be waterproof you can
easily in thoroughly clean it without
the fear breaking if you need the extra
range you can use the meter block it
will give you unlimited wireless range
capability in charge of the four meters
at once for nearly a year the technology
and prototype have been proven through
careful development extensive testing
and of course eating
pre-order your meter today and get it
before it hits the stores
when you see a problem my brain just
immediately starts thinking about how i
could put these things together these
these materials are these processes
together to really solve that problem
there's a personal satisfaction I get in
being able to take technology and do
something very meaningful and important
and valuable with it my name is Stefan
marsh I'm the inventor of the erring
technology and the president of the
company my name's Tom Cotton's I'm live
in southborough Massachusetts with my
wife I'm a farmer that's what I like to
do I found I had sleep apnea through a
test
sleep apnea is an inability to maintain
normal ventilation during sleep
oftentimes there's very dramatic snoring
gasping and choking in the night why
it's important to treat sleep apnea is
the longer term consequences and that's
where the associations with heart
disease metabolic disease higher risk of
stroke coronary disease heart attack
when you stop breathing and there's no
oxygen going to your brain that's going
to do some damage over time the most
common treatment is delivery of airway
pressure through a mask it wasn't
working for me it was extremely
cumbersome I didn't want to take the
mask off I wanted to rip the mask off
it's a minority of patients we were able
to tolerate the treatment at home so
I've got to find some way to deal with
this and keep a smile on my face man
starts out usually doing things in a way
that's brute force but sometimes you can
figure out a way to do it that's a
little bit more elegant a little bit
easier simpler but that usually requires
an invention
this is amazing I i really think that if
this works this will be the answer for
ninety-nine percent they'll never go
back to using that Star Wars piece on
their head again when I see this I say
how can that possibly get the air in me
when I first talked to people about this
and I say well you know we have these
little micro pumps and and turns out
that they're very powerful and they can
they come up the right amount of air at
the right amount of pressure their first
response is no way get out of here and
you know I got well yes I think we can
because our micro pumps our micro
blowers are very very small it's based
on two membranes that are
electrostatically attracted or repelled
from each other opposite charges attract
and that's the bellows closing and
blowing the air out and like charges
repel that's the bellows opening and
sucking air in and if hundreds and
hundreds of these little fellows are
plus or minus plus and minus going
together you get a large amount of air
to flow through zinc-air batteries is a
battery technology that has a lot of
stored energy in it it's very dense
which means it could be very small and
have the right amount of energy the nose
buds they're easy to insert really it's
one hand grab it stick it in you knows
you've done the molded silicon rubber is
extremely quiet everybody that we've
tested it with has found it very
comfortable really for the first time in
this disease we have a treatment that
patients will be willing to use
long-term consequences of sleep at
it will be reduced it's comfortable it's
well tolerated patients can sleep in a
variety of positions just a perfect
treatment it's almost like you can't
wait to try I gotta know it's important
to get this technology to get this
device to get the airing into people's
hands as quickly as possible the fastest
way that I know how to do that is to
raise sufficient amount of money so we
can and you facture it produce it and
get it out there so we're here to ask
you to give us a hand
if you can take this simple technology
and treat this sleeping disorder this
condition it just that's what
technologies for you've got to go do
something that's important and I can't
think of anything more important for
these blowers to do then save somebody's
life
the average person breathes in an
incredibly high amount of toxins every
day including environmental mold
introducing V brief the world's first
smart organic indoor air purifier that
gives you double protection by combining
HEPA filtration and the V active gel the
active gel is a composition of one
hundred percent food safe and organic
Australian essential oils blended into a
magical gel eliminating the smaller
invisible mold spores and harmful
bacteria it also deters mosquitoes and
flies and keeps you healthy v3 works by
the fan drawing polluted indoor air
through a vent at the base this air is
then cleaned by heavy particles drawn
through the medical grade HEPA filter as
the v3 picks up the organic vapors from
the V active gel and releases them into
the room from the top of the device
providing maximum circulation and
distribution v3 incorporates smart
technology which allows phone
connectivity and particle sensors that
advises of the air quality around you it
also removes bad odours pollens and pet
dander that helps asthma and allergy
sufferers this compact portable device
cleans the air throughout the entire
room including the air conditioner v3 is
extremely effective and is the only
organic air purifier that eliminates
ninety-eight percent of harmful indoor
microbes up to point one micron each
device comes with 3v active gel
cartridges and two filters that will
last up to one year every is a welcome
addition to making sure that you have an
environment which is positive
best able to reduce your toxin mode so V
breathe hopefully will reduce the top
some low that you're experiencing
everyday they're using a very very
high-end HEPA filter using a special gel
which is actually covering over the
molds and bacteria and it's removing
from the system there's one thing in
common between all 7 billion people on
this planet is that we all breathe in
what every breathe it matters a lot to
make people aware and to tell people how
the harmful areas affecting their life
and causing them different diseases is
the motivation behind this whole project
we want people to live and breathe and
healthy and Lana
