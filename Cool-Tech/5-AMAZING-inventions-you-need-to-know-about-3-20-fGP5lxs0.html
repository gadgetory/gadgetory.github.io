how do you know if the pillow you're
sleeping on is garbage warning what
you're about to see is actual actual
garbage I'm as shocked as you are ah so
that's how you know if the pillow you're
sleeping on is full of garbage
unfortunately expensive or cheap most
pillows on the market are simply
terrible and this is exactly why the
real-life comfort scientists that
brought you the revolutionary purple bed
with their inventive genius to work on
designing a completely new kind of
pillow presenting the purple pillow the
only pillow designed to perfectly
respond to your individual sleep tight
hook interesting still comfy thank you
sir you're free to go
huh but before we get too far into the
purple pillow let's take a quick look at
what's inside other pillows on the
market you see four years pillow
technology has refused to grow up like
your brother who's still waiting for his
hogwarts acceptance letter I caught the
snitch yes they basically take some
loose softish stuff and put it inside of
a bag this is a problem though if the
inside of a pillow is just loose fluff
no matter how you shape and shift your
pillow to fit your neck as you sleep it
all falls flat this is the reason that
no matter what your bedtime pillow looks
like your morning pillow looks like this
the half pipe a u-shaped Gulch caused by
a complete evacuation of the pillow
fluffed to either side the wedge the
flattening of fluff resulting in no neck
support and basic sadness the untamable
bulge caused by an overstuffed or over
firm pillow results in a 90 degree neck
sleep position and a future job as an
evil henchman the curvy girl these
curves are always either too much to
handle or there just isn't enough for
true neck support oh and its memory foam
so no thanks others though have tried to
fix the problem of loose fluff with this
memory foam but memory foam has its own
problems it starts softish then as it
warms the cells compact it loses its
shape and becomes a hot sweaty brick
unlike any pillow before it purple
pillow uses a patented comfort grid
system that gives locally but not
globally and even the design the grid
itself is specially engineered to sink a
bit more in the center where your head
rests while remaining comfortably
supportive under your neck where you
need it I mean just look at that
beautiful neck alignment and it doesn't
matter if you sleep backside or
undecided the purple pillow will give
you the exact support you need every
time and that there is the magic of
science everybody but what if you find
you need more or less support well for
those who crave adjustability the purple
pillow is equipped with an adjustable
air booster that
can raise or lower to your exact comfort
needs it's a completely new sleeping
experience it doesn't feel like the
pillows of old it's got kind of like a
blobby feel like sleeping on the belly
of a friendly fat man which trust me is
a good thing also we said it before
weight is quality and the purple pillow
is quality and its adjustability makes
it the perfect pillow for everyone yup
that's eighty comforts per minute mama
got comfortable so you can go ahead and
take all your old pillows and burn them
actually don't because many of them are
full of toxic chemicals that we just
don't want to breathe and hate to all
you chronic pillow flippers always
craving the cool side of the pillow well
you are always sleeping on the cool side
of the pillow it reads much cooler and
post lee temperature than the
competition if you or someone you know
sleeps you need the purple pillow click
