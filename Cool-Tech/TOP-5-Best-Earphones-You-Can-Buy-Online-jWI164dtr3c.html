north on Linton Avenue featuring a fully
kevlar reinforced cable made it to a
stainless steel housing Ryder bots are
built super tough to last too many
seasons
I'm Maurice the founder of rather bots
writing is my life ever since I got into
writing I've been looking for the
perfect audio solution I needed
something that would work well under the
helmet provide a crisp audio and also
protected my hearing
I've looked everywhere I've spent
hundreds of hours researching and
testing ordinary available solutions for
riders and they all disappointed me I'm
not alone over the last year I've talked
with over 1,000 riders on every kind of
bike and they all have the same
challenges I've tried just about
everything you can think of different
brands different styles music you can't
hear you have too much wind buffeting
noise normally I got to stick my finger
up there and try and get it into place
the speakers were a little bit sticking
out a little bit too far within the
helmet and the ease would start to get
sore after an hour of riding normally
when I put any earbuds in my ears and I
put my helmet on it pulls down or takes
them out or hurt so I flew to Asia and
hired dedicated engineers to solve these
problems for every writer once and for
all this is how Ryder BOTS were born we
work very closely with our supporters
and have built the ultimate audio
solution based on all that feedback
we've been gathering for the past year
but don't take my word for it listen to
what some of our beta testers have to
say but with Ryder buds fits like a
glove
put my helmet on without even thinking
that they're in my ears at all I can
hear music the way it's intended I can
hear my passenger on the back they seal
in your ear you get a really good
quality sound that background noise
drops right down you can hear
with complete clarity what's happening
on your phone or your GPS system or
whatever you choose it works and it's an
excellent either but they completely fix
this problem is a good quality sound in
a smallest compact size rider buds are a
game changer
we have finalized our prototypes and are
ready to go to mass production but
because of expensive manufacturing and
tooling investment we cannot continue
without your support so go ahead and
buck is now and let's all bring rider
butts to reality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
