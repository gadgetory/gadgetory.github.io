of stealth a year ago I was at the gym
staring down at my phone doing the plank
exercise and I was so bored the next day
I called my buddy Don Brown I call him
the king of all abs he developed the Ab
Roller sold in millions of homes I've
been designing fitness products for over
30 years when how he shared his idea for
stealth I was all in I love the concept
of using your core muscles to play games
on your phone now that's exciting we
went through dozens of designs and
testing until we finalize stealth I'm
really competitive so being able to
compete against other people when on it
is so fun you completely forget about
the whole feeling of working out because
you're focusing on the game I think
that's the best part about it is that
you get a great workout you're working a
lot of different muscle groups but
you're also having fun we are so excited
to bring stealth to life tap everyone

hi I'm Aaron founder and inventor of yo
yo Matt hi I'm you sigh I'm the clear
director of the yo-yo Matt there's any
of this same familiar to you hey does
this looks messy why does every single
time you work at a yoga session you're
not with frustration doesn't make sense
it should never be that hard to use your
yoga mat it should be easier so we set
out with the goal kind of creative
solution to solve this problem a map
that stays flat while you're working out
and rolls up all by itself kind of like
this slap on wrist but this was then
this is now introducing the world's
first self rolling younger man we call
it yo yo Matt let us show you how it
works to unroll the mat give yo yo Matt
a toss with the top side facing up when
yo yo Matt is unrolled it stays
perfectly flat with no annoying curling
edges and when you're done simply flip
your yo-yo mat over it will roll itself
up or give it a click it stays rolled up
without the need of straps or bags the
more it's used the better it rose and
the storage has never been easier and
cleaner to make a working prototype and
require a lot of thinking hard work a
lot of creative engineering this idea
seems simple at first it turns out
wasn't as simple as we thought first I
had to get the idea out of my head and
onto paper
finally we worked all the kinks out came
up with a prototype and after all that
we also secure the US patents the yo-yo
Matt's not made just for yoga for all
fitness activities kids playing that
stretching dancers and Floyd the
Frenchie loves it so normal of that
allowing you a little more of this so
now we your help are you backing this
project we will be able to take you on
your mats from prototype to production
