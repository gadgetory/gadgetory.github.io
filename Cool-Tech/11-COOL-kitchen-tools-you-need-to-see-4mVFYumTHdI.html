experienced chef things don't always go
as you plan in the kitchen sometimes the
dish turns out undercooked and sometimes
things end up burnt simple temperature
control is still an unsolved problem in
the kitchen at meld
we want to change that we want to help
people cook the perfect meal every time
we built the MELD knob clip and add that
together make up the world's first
automatic temperature cooking control
system that work with your existing
cooktop and cookware this is the MELD
knob and it's the key to controlling
temperatures the MELD knob replaces the
existing knob on your gas or electric
cooktop
it automatically turns the burner up or
down to keep the food at the perfect
temperature the MELD knob knows how to
adjust temperature based on data it
receives from the melt clip the clip
attaches to the cookware you already own
and continuously measures the
temperature of the food you are cooking
to within less than a degree this is the
meld app it contains hundreds of chef's
tested recipes that will automatically
control the burner and take the
guesswork out of cooking of course you
can make your own recipes or manually
control the knob if you'd like meld
reacts so quickly that as soon as you
add cold food to a pot it knows to turn
up the heat to maintain temperature and
it knows exactly when to turn it down
so nothing overcooked no controls the
temperature while you control the flavor
and meals come out perfectly each time
the MELD knob and clip are ideal for
slow cooking simmering sous-vide
poaching frying and even candy making
we're passionate about helping people
make great meals we perfected the
science of cooking and made the MELD
knob and clip the easiest solution to
help you be creative and confident in
everything you cook unlike other
companies that create bulky
single-purpose gadgets that clutter your
countertop and force you to learn new
skills we focused on building a product
that works with the things you already
own

say hello to neo the world's first
smudger

today we don't always know what's in our
country it's really hard to know how
healthy we are eating or to track
nutrition not to mention how annoying it
is when things run out so it's key labs
we created BM @ smudger that brings our
kitchen into the connected world neo is
built with sensors and Bluetooth
connectivity configure it once and neo
remembers what you have and how much of
it wondering what to make for dinner

really food safe it has an airtight lid
it works in the fridge goes into the
dishwasher and charges wirelessly the
light ring at the base provides visual
feedback for all your actions in the

really hard to bring the right design
and technology together to create the
smart jar after terms of research and
numerous prototypes in January we
successfully introduced neo at the
Consumer Electronics Show and now we
need your help to take neo to the next
level creating next generation
