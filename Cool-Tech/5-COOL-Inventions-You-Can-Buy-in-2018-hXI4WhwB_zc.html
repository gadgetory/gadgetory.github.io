automatically mimics the light of the
Sun gently waking him in the morning
now meet Chris without REO his body
clock is out of sync and it affects him
physically and mentally getting up is a
struggle and he leaves for work in a fog
REO is Wi-Fi connected and learns
Chris's needs over time like when to
turn off and it provides a dose of
bright light early in the day prompting
his body to produce cortisol the hormone
that makes us feel energized on a sunny
day while Chris feels groggy and can't
seem to focus with the right light at
the right time he's on top of his game
in the evening REO slowly dims and worms
calming amber light enables Chris's
melatonin levels to rise naturally
helping him relax bright light at night
throws off Chris's sleep patterns he's
caught in an unhealthy cycle while a
sunset light glow prepares Chris for
sleep
REO helps Chris keep his body clock in
sync so he can be the best version of
himself
