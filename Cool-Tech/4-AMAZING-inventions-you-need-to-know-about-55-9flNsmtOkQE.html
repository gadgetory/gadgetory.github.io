and founder of vinyl uh vintage vinyl
design and have been making products and
recycled records for almost 15 years
I first partnered up with uncommon good
in late 2002 and I had designed a couple
of bowls made out of vinyl records one
of the kind of funny questions that I
frequently get asked is yeah I like the
bowl can you still play it so I kind of
felt like it was an interesting
challenge to come up with a way to
actually play the record again
Kickstarter offers us a really nice
platform to present this brand-new
product delivering contemporary sound
through a vintage format by partnering
with Jeff we could bring his design and
craft know-how to our production
experience and you as a Kickstarter
community to get this product to market
that we could really never do any other
way when I first began the design work
for the Bluetooth speaker I was looking
at a number of different sources for
inspiration one was aesthetics of
gramophone the other was the aesthetics
of old radios with the help of feedback
from the development team that uncommon
good the record is really celebrated as
the main design feature in addition to
making this thing look really cool we
also wanted to sound really good so we
partnered with a leading audio component
supplier and listened to a lot of
components before we were really sure
this thing was going to
suppose so behind Metanoia record is a
four inch driver connected to an amp and
loop report this makes a really great
mono sound coming out of the middle and
really fixing the design as an
independent design and manufacturing
company it's often difficult to launch a
brand new product and be able to pay for
all of the tooling up cost and the ramp
up cost to make 10,000 20,000 units of
something we're coming to the
Kickstarter community because we need
you to pledge so we can get electronics
and get Jess to work making this request
to genre you pick one of the genres we
have listed and we'll find a record for
80's folk R&amp;amp;B divas show tunes
jazz crooners disco classical opera and
classic country above that we have
create your own custom label choose from
one of four custom design formats or
submit your own artwork if you already
have a record you really like send it in
and we'll use that to make your vintage
vinyl bluetooth speaker and our highest
pledge level is name your tune you tell
us what's your favorite album is and
we'll find it for you we're kind of
giving you the best of both worlds you
can kind of put your best foot forward
as a vinyl fan and listen to your
digital music through
hearing protection should be a concern
to all but these plugs aren't created
solely for avoiding hearing loss we've
created plugs that you'll want to have
for those times when you need to
minimize distraction focus more intently
sleep more deeply and simply control
your environment better while other
plugs may reduce sound they're awkward
and unattractive design is far from
something you would want to wear in
public the tulip tip on the XP reactor
and the XP defender has been designed to
fit so comfortably that they can be worn
for long periods of time when worn
properly they fit inside the ear which
makes them discreet with minimal
visibility the XP defender has the added
capability of allowing you to easily
open and close the sound value with just
the push of a button imagine the power
to quickly and easily reduce bothersome
noise around you and then quickly
disable them for full hearing capability
as one of our five senses the ability to
hear is a precious gift that we need to
protect
unfortunately we take our hearing for
granted and as a result one in three
people in America over the age of 65 has
hearing loss loud sounds can occur
long-term damage to your hearing as a
sound enters the ear fluid is pushed
through the cochlea which contains
80,000 hair cells that convert
vibrations into electrical pulses these
pulses are then sent to the audio
receptors of the brain when exposed to
loud noise the hair cells in the cochlea
will receive a reparable damage causing
permanent hearing loss for you
these innovative plugs are the stylish
and convenient solution for hearing
protection and reduction when you needed
the most support this product today to
receive these innovative ear plugs at a
discounted price and before the rest of
the market dies thank you for your
support
