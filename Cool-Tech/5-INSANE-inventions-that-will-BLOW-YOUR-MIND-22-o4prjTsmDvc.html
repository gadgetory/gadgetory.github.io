are defined by climate maybe you are too
hot on a summer's day and wish you could
take all your clothes off or perhaps you
were too cold during winter and can't
even send a text because your hands are
too shaky from shivering or how about
having those dreaded night sweats and
you can't turn on the air-conditioner or
a/c because your wife has cold feet what
is one to do
introducing that aircon watch the aircon
watch is a new revolutionary product
that will allow you to get that
much-needed thermal satisfaction without
disturbing the soul you can warm
yourself up or cool yourself down even
if you are out in the scorching Sun or
in a frigid winter's night doing any
outdoor activity most times depends on
the temperature and the climate on the
other hand being inside all depends and
if your heater or air conditioner is on
and using up electricity the aircon
watch offers the convenience that you
need by freeing you from an energy
wasting air conditioner but never
limiting you to the outside temperature
and all within the form of a small watch
the human body has a natural body
temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit
but depending on the weather and
external temperature our body responds
by sending a signal to the nervous
system whereby the brain receives the
signal which gives the sensation that we
are feeling at that exact moment but
what if we could change the signal that
our nervous system sends to the brain by
using the aircon watch to generate
pulses of heat or cold with this method
we can make our body start to feel more
aware of the temperatures and thus
stabilize our sensations imagine running
your wrist through a stream of icy or
warm water this is the feeling that you
will get from aircon watch the secret is
in the straps it contains a small device
that has within it our climate con
technology this tiny device will fit on
the inner wrist in an area where the
nerves are closer to the skin surface so
as to allow for maximum transfer of
temperature the watch can be used during
any temperature in the season or any
time zone if you suffer from night
sweats you can now finally have a cozy
night
if you like climbing or outdoor
photography aircon watch could be your
best friend but one of the reasons why
we developed this product was to help
women during menopause menopause often
has hot flashes which can be extremely
annoying to the extent where it becomes
painful but what if you could get some
relief from a small device that emits a
soothing cool temperature the aircon
watch has been tested with more than a
hundred people and using several
prototypes our experienced design team
has worked for more than two years in
research and development to improve
aircon watch and reach the design and
level that we are at today global
warming is gradually destroying the
Earth's entire ecosystem so why not turn
that a/c off and turn on the aircon
watch it most definitely will help keep
your pocket fuller and your body cooler

hello everybody
today we are proud to announce a new
exciting way to capture sound
say hello to insta Mike the smartest
Mike on earth ready to record I first
thought about insta Mike when I noticed
I was missing a lot of great sounds in
my work buzz in my life so about ear ago
I decided to involve friends and experts
from the field to create instant mic
from scratch in stomach is a very small
microphone with the ability of onboard
recording it's waterproof and he has a
lot of mountains that's why I think is
Mark the insta mike is time and it's
been challenging to design such a great
quality microphone and this form factor
using the latest in ultra low power
digital signal processing and MEMS
microphone technology we've been able to
do just that we're even building in
wireless connectivity so it'll be as
easy as possible for you to use as a
video maker I imagine how much easier it
would be to just put it on my subject
and be free to focus on the video I
think everybody will find their own way
to use it
journalists bloggers sound designers
everybody who works with audio or simply
wants to capture the sound of the world
we keep pushing to make the best product
so you can make yours now we need your
help to make it happen to bring the
shared experience to success I think
insta mike is freedom and creativity
video is how we look by audio is what we
feel we thank you for your support
we're over and we just made a whole new
way to chill
hi I'm Tommy de Francia and this is the
rover roller Rovers mission is to make
gathering the outdoors more fun I was
tired of soggy foods back-breaking hauls
and warm drinks so I decided to make my
own cooler and Rover was born we started
with the best materials the best
manufacturers to make the best cooler
ever even the Bears couldn't handle it
sorry bears introducing the roller 60
the same amazing quality the same bear
proof durability the same powerful
utility all in a compact 60 quart
package with even better features the
roller 60 is the mobile hub for your
campsite tailgate picnic or anywhere
else you might find yourself lounging in
the open air it's perfect for people who
love the great outdoors without all the
great outdoor hassle and brings the
comfort of home anywhere we pack the
roller 60 with all the features we
wanted and never found in any other
product we tackled the design by
thinking of three main phases of outdoor
recreation first there's the getting
there we were sick of the super heavy
and super clunky coolers that were a
total hassle to move anywhere the roller
60s toughest nails with Broudy molded
construction and it's also got the most
advanced all-terrain wheels so it easily
rolls right along with you on the most
rugged of terrain we even made the
wheels bigger to make it easier to get
across and our dual grip aluminum
t-handle makes for extremely easy
leverage and comfortable pulling on both
ends so it doesn't matter if you're a
lefty or righty you won't be getting any
more heel knocks there's probably
someone who loves taking three separate
trips to haul gear from the car to the
campsite we just haven't met them yet
that's why we include our collapsible
wagon bin
perfect for hauling sleeping bags dry
goods and all kinds of stuff
quick-release velcro attachments let you
add or remove the bin fully loaded and
if you're not using it it makes it comfy
seat and if two wheels are your thing
then you're really in luck because the
roller 60 is the first cooler with a
bicycle hitch allowing for attaching go
haulage that you literally can't find
anywhere else and because it's durable
it can stand the toughest of abuse
second bears the keeping cool the roller
sixty is even cooler than your average
cooler it's capable of keeping your
stuff cool for 10 whole days you heard
that right over a week of ice retention
that we've battle-tested ourselves and
with separate tribe bins there's no more
hamburger meat rub and toes with your
sodas or unidentified juices overtaking
everything else inside you can organize
a roller 60 just like your own fridge
and finally there's a real important
work of parting down while all your
stuff stays cool and dry inside the
roller 60 turns into your mobile food
prep station and bar to the cutting
board dual cupholders and stash bag that
allow access to the inside of the roller
while in use you can even use the anchor
points to tie the roller down or hook
other accessories up like your
entertainment center
