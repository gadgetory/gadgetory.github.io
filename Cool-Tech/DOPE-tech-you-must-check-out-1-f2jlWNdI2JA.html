you try and take a picture on your phone
it gives you two options one pay to
upgrade your phone storage or to fleet
old memories and yeah sure you could pay
for cloud service let's see real storage
upgrades get expensive plus giving
someone else control over your memories
is actually pretty creepy right
that's where tilt shoebox comes in plug
in any external drive connected to Wi-Fi
and now you've got your own private
cloud seriously it's that simple
our memory on your phone needs more
real-life memories safe and sound
flip-flops people are you ready to chill
like never before introducing Auto the
world's first smart milling machine with
Auto you can mill anything you want
you're only limited by your imagination
just mil fill and chill and all at the
touch of a button
ordinary grinders leave dry materials in
a powder and moist materials clumpy but
Auto is not a grinder it's the first
milling device that uses artificial
intelligence to expertly mill material
instead of grinding it here's how it
works inside Auto is our patented smart
milling technology first Auto senses the
density and consistency of your favorite
natural products then Auto automatically
changes the direction calibrates the
milling pressure and even adjust the
speed as it mils to create a perfect
grind every single time and all at the
touch of a button
combined with custom-made aerospace
engineered cutting blades Auto will make
sure that your grind is a perfect
consistency perfectly milled perfect
every time whether your material is
coarse moist dry highly dense lumpy or
even sticky Auto will fill your waiting
sachet or cone evenly from tip to top
there's never been anything like it Auto
makes it easy to take it easy
Netflix a treat oh you want to check
Hulu sometimes I'm searching for things
longer but I'm actually watching stuff a
lot of like you know going down that was
a very hard process in trying to find
this watched broad city season 2 episode
2 the TV's just turned on watch The
Walking Dead don't watch my scary watch
ABC watch CNN watch Vanderpump rules
watch best friends whenever Jews wow
that was quick we love talking to our
community we are a crowdfunded company
and we've been receiving a lot of
feedback and the number one request has
been for additional sizes that have the
same functionality as the original hero
clip
the first is a small which works really
well in daily life to hold things like
computer bags purses and camera and gear
bags then we have the mini a truly
compact hero clip that's perfect for
smaller items like toiletry and makeup
bags water bottles and for travel
I'm happy to say they've become a big
hit already with our testers
here Oh clip is a hybrid clip with a
fully functional carabiner on one end
and a hook with a rubber tip for grip on
the other and in between a 360-degree
rotating swivel that makes the gear you
hang infinitely more accessible it even
folds compact when you're not using it
hi I'm Daniel from engineer bowl after
the release of our product focus shifter
users requested an additional handle for
operating the zoom without follow focus
accessories Glenn shifter is a solution
designed for both photographers and
videographers lend shifter provides
smoother more precise focusing and
zooming photographers use lens shifter
to fine-tune their focus and zoom
quickly to capture that perfect shot
it's quick and easy to install
videographers use lens shifter to
precisely adjust focus and zoom red and
blue colors make it simple to
distinguish between each function using
the included balanced counterweight the
lens shifter stays in place when the
camera is moved and can be stored away
ready for your next shoot it just gives
you that mechanical advantage and look
at that that doesn't move you can't make
that move really that's great definitely
something every starting videographer
should have in their kit I really do
love the smooth motion you get if you
take this on one shoot and use it for
three shots you have gotten your money
back focus on your craft using lunch
shifter thank you for your continued
support
