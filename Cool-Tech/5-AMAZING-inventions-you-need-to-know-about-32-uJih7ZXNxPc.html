through a gap in the fence every
scientist running for an answer and all
the lovers staring into the sky while
dreaming a law searching we always turn
to the night sky filled with the wonder
of a billion stars in space around all
the flick up but how many of us can
capture it frame it bring it home and
share now you can capture space in a
palm of your hand that's why we meet
tiny one it was smaller smothers and
more social astronomy camera redesigning
one you can capture the nice guy and
never before you no longer have to worry
about expensive equipment or advanced
photography knowledge just point and
shoot we developed proprietary noise
reduction technology that allows you to
effectively improve image quality over
various environmental conditions without

constellations easily the tiny one is
also compatible with all the lenses out
there and even telescope to be mentioned
it takes selfies too it connects
seamlessly to your smartphone and allows
direct sharing to your favorite social
media so the tiny one is not just about
the night sky it's about you like Neil
deGrasse Tyson said when I look up at
the night sky I know that we are part of
the symbols we are in this universe but
more importantly the universe is the
dinner
one you not only be able to see the
infinite expanse of the universe but to
be able to capture it in a way you
really get a chance to we've been
working on a tiny one for the past two
years we may access the various reviews
and accessible to all now we need your
help to bring anyone into production and
into the hands of every curious Explorer

survive think he missed warrior-poets 90
degrees if girlfriend still think he
felt unbelievably fresh yes the nose
works just fine research clusters
everything just rolls off this guy
now the laundry goes out to discern like
this undeniably stay tight tiny to spend
doing other stuff like getting ready for
a trip to London a week-long vacation is
she impacting another shirt not he can
go comfortably from gym to work dinners
to an international trip it just assured
he's wearing and what he gets home he's
going to throw it back on the chair and
do it all over again the next day and
the day after that
so how does it work a blue shirts and
hoodies are activated with chilies
zillions across that physics natural
fabrics repel liquids without affecting
how soft and breathable they are this
makes able utakata see personhood is
incredibly stain resistant water line
coffee even such a bit must resist roll
right off what about Otis just West

big picture washing and drying a load of
laundry every two days creates about 970
pounds of co2 each year multiply that by
everyone in the world who has laundry
asst billions of pounds of co2 we could
save by doing laundry less often of
