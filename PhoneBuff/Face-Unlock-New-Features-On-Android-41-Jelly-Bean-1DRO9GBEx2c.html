this video I will show you the two new
features that come with face unlock on
Android 4.1 jelly bean as you can see I
am running on the latest version of
jelly bean 4.1.1 I'll go ahead and go
into the security settings and show you
what's new so let's go to screen lock
tap face unlock it's gonna give you the
you know normal things that saying like
face unlock isn't as secure as a pin or
a password someone who looks like you
can unlock it yada yada
we ready know that for best results says
find an indoor spot not too bright not
too dim and hold the phone at eye level
I've got one of them down I've got a
good you know lighting condition but I
don't have I'm not gonna put the phone
up eye level because once you guys to be
able to see so anyway I'm just gonna put
my face into this little white circle as
you can see this little these little
green dots are circling around my face
there you go it's completed capturing my
face I'm just gonna hit continue and of
course you have to set up a backward
pattern or a pin I'm just gonna do a
pattern like a quick L continue quick L
confirm and there you go you're all done
to unlock phone just look at it to
improve face matching by having
different conditions captured so that's
one thing that's nice I'll go ahead and
tap on this so basically what you're
gonna do is you would go to improve face
bedroom so this is something that is an
Ice Cream Sandwich you tap on this guy
and you know for example you have to put
in a password again cuz you're gonna be
putting in your face again so anyway you
could try it in different lighting you
do it with or without glasses with a
beard or you know without a beard I'm
not gonna shave just for this video but
uh you know I don't have any
prescription glasses I could try there
but I'll go ahead and you know try to do
sunglasses maybe if I could find them
you know what forget that I'm just gonna
hit continue and we'll just do a
different angle so we know we'll try it
from the top so go ahead and try to see
if you guys can see that I'm going a
little bit farther back so that way you
know it's a different position hit done
and we'll go ahead and hit home and see
how it works so we'll see the accuracy
really quick there you go unlock right
away I'll do a big smile
there you go it worked again I look
surprised there you go so you guys get
it really accurate now I feel like it's
actually more accurate than it was an
Ice Cream Sandwich I mean it was pretty
accurate to begin with but looks a
little bit quicker
and a little bit more accurate now with
jellybean let's go ahead and go back
into the face lock settings I want to
show you the next thing which is
actually the liveness check so obviously
you guys probably saw the videos you
know you could actually take a picture
and put it in from the camera of your of
your servers I don't get still your
picture for example and trick the phone
into thinking you're there but if you
check this guy to live in this check
it's gonna be a lot harder for you know
people to actually steal your phone and
do that so what you have to do now is
when you try to unlock your phone it's
gonna ask you to blink so I have to
blink and there you go it unlocks it so
I'll go ahead and show you what it looks
like if I don't blink so I'm just not
gonna blink and you can see it says
didn't catch your blink and enter your
pain or password so what's gonna answer
this guy in and you can see it is a
little bit more secure so pretty cool
other than that everything's just about
the same I mean you know you have the
different you know face matching
conditions you can do so you could do it
and I would do it you know in a darker
area you know with glasses on without a
beard I mean it's gonna you know take
you a while to get all the different
conditions down maybe over the course of
a couple days but it really does make it
more accurate you know especially if
you're not you know for example I had a
lot of issues you know in the dark with
it but I have noticed since I've been
using jellybean that you know even in
low lighting light conditions it is
working a lot better so definitely
something that you know I like about
jellybean and something that's worth
checking out so anyway that's it for me
