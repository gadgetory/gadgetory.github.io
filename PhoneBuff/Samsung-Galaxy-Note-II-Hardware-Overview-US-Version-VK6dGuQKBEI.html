calm and this video we'll be taking a
look at the US version of the samsung

physical home button and two capacitive
touch buttons just like on the galaxy s3
one from menu and another foot back on
the back of the device we have an 8
megapixel camera with LED flash and then
some samson or carrier specific branding
and right below that branding you'll
find the speaker grill and then of
course the a span which is improved
compared to the one on the original
Samsung Galaxy Note mainly because it's
bigger making it a little bit more
comfortable to hold in the hand also it
feels like the slot of the pen goes into
is a little bit more stable 2 on the
bottom of the note to you have a micro
USB charging port and a microphone on
the left side of device we have a volume
rocker for volume up and down on the
right side we have nothing but the power
button to turn the screen on and off or
