and in this video I will show you how to
enable voice CMD on your Samsung Galaxy
s3
lotty guys would ask me how to do this
on the 50 reasons video so instead of
responding to individual comments I will
go ahead and make this quick how-to so
from your home screen tap the Menu
button and then go over to settings and
then from settings scroll down to where
it says language and input so right over
here and then from here scroll down
again to voice CMD for apps so you can
see right now the switch is set to OFF
all you got to do is switch it to on and
if you want to have a little bit more
option to just tap on this guy right
over here and then you can see you could
actually disable or enable certain voice
commands for certain apps so for example
if you don't want voice controls for
incoming calls you go and uncheck it so
you have to worry about accidentally
picking up or rejecting a call that you
may not want to for an alarm camera
music you do the same thing I'm not
going to go into the individual you know
commands here but if you guys want to
know them you can actually just read
these texts are this text right below
each option and it actually tell you how
to do it so I'm gonna go ahead and back
out up here and really quick I'll go
ahead and demonstrate how it works so
I'll open up the camera app on my phone
and you can see I'm talking about
normally would so it's not going to
respond to you know anything I'm saying
until actually give it the command and
needs so for example capture take it
phone buff so you can see it only
responds to the actual commands that you
know it's listening out for so it's
pretty accurate sometimes you do have to
repeat yourself a few times for it to
actually work but you know overall it's
been you know pretty good for me I
mostly enjoy the camera one you know
when I'm taking that self-portrait with
you know me and somebody else really
easy to do that instead of trying to
find that little shutter button but
anyway that's pretty much it for me in
this video if you found it helpful
please hit the like button it helps me
out a lot and subscribe to the channel
if you haven't already thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
