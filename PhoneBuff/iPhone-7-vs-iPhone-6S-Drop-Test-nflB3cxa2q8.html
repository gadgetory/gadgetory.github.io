have a drop test between last year's
iPhone success and the all new iPhone 7
to see not only how each phone performs
but maybe even more importantly to see
whether or not Apple improve the
durability of their latest flagship but
before we give to the test
I want to give a big shout out to tech
21 for sponsoring today's video so the
good folks at tech 21 sent us a couple
of their new cases and asked us to do
what we do best and test them with the
iPhone 7 and when we did their Evo
tactical extreme case handled the back
bottom side and face drops like a boss
as you can see here while there are only
a few scuff marks on the case itself
underneath the iPhone 7 is still
flawless no dings no dents and most
importantly no cracked screen this is
thanks to the Flex akkk material found
inside of the case which absorbs and
dissipates the impact force and prevents
it from passing into your device the evo
tactical extreme is available for both
the iPhone 7 and 7 plus and a number of
different color options so click on that
first link down below in the description
to learn more all right let's get right
into the drop test round number one
backdrop three two one
after that backdrop both phones get a
few scuff marks along their 7000 series
aluminum bodies but for the most part
nothing too serious it does look a bit
worse on the iPhone 7 but that's mainly
due to the color difference here so
we're gonna have to call it a tie in
round number one round number two bottom
drop three two one
okay both phones handled that bottom
drop really really well the small little
scratches each one suffered are only
visible under direct light like we have
it here but in normal conditions you can
barely even see them making it a draw in
round number two round number three side
drop three two one so same old story
once again because the designs on both
phones are nearly identical so are the
results here in the third round the
scuffs are more visible on the matte
black color option once again which I
imagine would be the same for the jet
black color option on the iPhone 7 as
well but in terms of actual damage it's
a tie here in round number three round
number four base drop three two one
and the iPhone screen cracks after that
face drop just like it did on the iPhone
success what's interesting here though
is that while the spider web pattern is
different on each phone in terms of
total damage they did about the same so
it looks like Apple isn't using the new
Gorilla Glass 5 and instead is using
these same glass that they used on the
success
making round number for a tie once again
bonus round okay so with both on
surviving all four drops with tides
across the board it'll come down to this
bonus round to determine a winner last
time the iPhone success was able to
survive five additional drops in the
bonus round before giving out so today
we'll see how many drops the iPhone 7
can take before it technically can't
make a phone call and go
all right before it'll match the iPhone
success every guys you dramatically
different paths in and when I go okay
three two one
don't work all right
well no now it's definitely better than
knives on success and PC what I think
it's still working yeah oh okay we are
very close to dying today
oh man you could be on so oh my god like
we need to be very edge who you call I
don't know I can't it's not really
usable
okay while the screen kind of still
works that whole right side is unusable
and is registering random touches making
it almost impossible to make a phone
call so while it didn't get knocked out
cold like the iPhone success did after
five bonus drops it is a technical
knockout here after eight drops for the
iPhone 7 which gives the iPhone 7d
slight edge over the iPhone success in
our rankings making it the fifth most
durable smartphone we have ever tested
here on the channel anyways that is it
for me in this video thank you guys for
watching in as always I'll see you in
the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
