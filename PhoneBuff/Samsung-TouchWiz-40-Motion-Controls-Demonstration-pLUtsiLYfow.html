calm and in this video i'm going to show
you samsung's motion control settings
that comes with TouchWiz four point oh
and you'll actually see this on multiple
devices this is the ATT galaxy note here
but you'll pretty much see on any other
galaxy device I'm other than the Galaxy
Nexus that's running touch with four
point oh whether you're the
international galaxy s2 or the t-mobile
AT&amp;amp;T or Sprint rebranded version so with
that said I'll go ahead go ahead and go
over to the settings and show you the
motion control settings as you can see
at the top I have it activated by having
the checkmark and you can see the four
offers that I have appt till to zoom pan
to edit shake to update and turn over to
mute so i'll go ahead and show you each
one of these starting with the tilt to
zoom so go ahead and open up my gallery
here's a picture of my dog and i'll go
ahead and zoom in and out of the picture
so obviously you can do the multi-touch
pinch to zoom which you know what we're
familiar with but if you wanted a
different method of zooming in and out
you can actually put two fingers on the
screen whether you like this or with
your two thumbs and you can actually pan
the forward are you can tilt the phone
forward and backwards and zoom in and
out so it's painting in and panning out
based off of how I move it and of course
the faster I go the faster it'll go and
the more I tilt it the farther will go
into zooming in so it works there in the
gallery it also works in the browser so
go ahead and show you that really quick
so here's the browser same thing two
fingers and I kazoom in and out so
pretty cool little future there the next
one is the tilts over to mute so I'll go
ahead and start playing a song really
quick and then I'll tilt it over so
there you go so you can see i tilted it
over it automatically pauses the song it
mutes the sound it doesn't just work for
music though it also works if you're
getting a call and you don't want to you
know pick it up right then there you
could flip the phone over to its face
and it'll automatically put it on silent
look so another cool feature and the
next one I want to show you is not
necessarily the most useful one and
that's the shake to a search so
I'll go ahead and go over is for
bluetooth so go to wireless network I'll
go to bluetooth settings and you can see
right now it's not scanning for any
devices if I shake the phone now you can
see it's scanning so I really don't know
how useful that is I mean you can just
press the scan for devices button I
think it's just more or less that's more
of a gimmick than anything but anyway
that's another future and then the last
one I want to show you is let's go to
the settings really quick is the pen to
edit so you could actually change the
sensitivity to in the settings for just
about all these options but what I'll go
ahead and do is demonstrate it really
quick so say I wanted to move on the
location of this little shortcut right
here so with if you had entry before you
know how it works you have to press and
hold of the edge of the screen in order
to get it to move now sometimes that can
be kind of difficult especially if you
have a case on the phone we're not
really able to get close to the edge
what's cool is with this phone you could
actually are with this future you could
this tilt the device over like that and
it'll actually move from home screen to
home screen so if I wanted to go all the
way over I can do that drop it and there
you go so that's motion control settings
it's honestly a pretty cool feature that
comes with TouchWiz and you know I mean
it doesn't necessarily hurt the
experience so I welcome it just wanted
to give you guys a quick demo all right
