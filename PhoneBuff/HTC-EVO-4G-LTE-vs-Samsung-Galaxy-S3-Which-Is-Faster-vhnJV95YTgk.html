calm and this is gonna be doing a speed
comparison test between the samsung
galaxy s3 this is actually t-mobile's
variant against the HTC One X this is
actually Sprint's Evo 4G LTE variants so
we'll go ahead and start our first test
which is the boot up test and then I'll
let you know what other tests we'll be
running so I'm going to do press the
power button at the same time so 1 2 3
hold it for a couple of seconds and let
go now you can see that the Galaxy s3 is
showing us the screen first now we see
it on the HTC One X keep in mind that
the HTC One X doesn't have fast-food
enabled you could enable on the options
and it would make a lot of a lot faster
but because it doesn't come as factory
default I'm not gonna do that and we'll
go ahead and wait and see you know which
one turns on first now while these guys
are loading I'll let you guys know that
they're running on the same Wi-Fi
network so we see that the galaxy s3 did
load up the lock screen first we're
still waiting on the One X I cleared out
the browsing history on both of these
devices because I am doing a browser
speed comparison as well so those are
both cleaned out so it's gonna be a nice
even test and even though home screens
are actually equal I you know don't have
any widgets or anything running in the
background they have five home screens
same application shortcuts on the home
screen so let's go ahead and unlock this
guy alright so you can see the home
screen is pretty much the same nothing
running the back down so let's go ahead
and start our first application speed
test and it'll be Google Earth
so I'll tapping about the same time so
one two three and looks like they load
it up pretty much exactly the same time
I'm gonna call that one a tie because
honestly it was way too close we'll see
which one actually populates the 3d
buildings first and now you can see it's
the galaxy s3 in this case so the win
goes to the galaxy s3 because it did our
it is loading up these 3d buildings in
Las Vegas a little bit faster than the
one X is so we'll go ahead and back out
of here and let's go ahead and go to the
next application
which is the dictionary up so one two
three
pretty much again at the same time maybe
a split second faster on the galaxy s3
both of these guys are running the same
processor which is the 1.5 bigger
dual-core Snapdragon s4 processor so
it's kind of expected but the galaxy s3
does have a gig up on the h2 1x at 2
gigs versus one gig so let's go ahead
and look up the word dog so dog and I
will hit the search button at the same
time if I can so 1 2 3 and pretty much
the same time again maybe a split second
faster on the galaxy s3 go ahead and
back on it right now keeping the apps up
open in the background because we're
both running are these both these phones
are running Android and I really want to
give you a true experience for us which
phone's gonna be faster obviously the
actually gig might give the galaxy s3 an
advantage but we'll go ahead and go on
to the next test which is Flixter so I'm
gonna tap these guys at the same time 1
2 3 that was pretty much a tie so go
ahead and back out of here and let's
load up the Play Store 1 2 3 a little
bit faster on the galaxy s3 in this case
let's go ahead and load up the
calculator not the calculators it's the
Samsung calculator is the HTC calculator
so keep that in mind they're not the
same app unlike these other ones I have
tested so 1 2 3 this case the HTC
application opened up first so that when
X got its first one in the app speed
test so open up Google Maps so 1 2 3
about the same there so back out of here
now let's go ahead and run a quadrant
standard benchmark so I'm go ahead and
close out these applications for the
benchmark so that way you know we get
you know a nice fair benchmark we'll go
ahead and close them out of here like
that and that will run quadrant and I'll
just basically skip through the whole
process a lot way you guys can see the
score so
okay so both our Don's hit yes and you
can see the result we got on the Samsung
Galaxy s3 was a 49:22 4920 - really good
score and on the One X we got a forty
seven eighty fours four thousand seven
hundred eighty four so slightly higher
on the galaxy s3 and what I'm not really
surprised by that considering that the
application speed test so far haven't
been in favor of the galaxy s3 as well
so go ahead and hit home out of here
next application will run is the camera
app so I want to see you know which
one's gonna load up the camera first and
you know which one will let you take the
picture of that you know Kodak moment so
let's go ahead and press camera at the
same time so one two three and you can
see the viewfinder was looking at the
image way before on the HTC One X then
it wasn't the galaxy s3 in this case so
definitely advantage goes to the One X
and let's go ahead and do the browser
speed test now so I'm going to leave
those two apps up open in the background
will open up the browser and the first
website we're gonna visit of course is
gonna be bomb buff calm alright so I
loaded from our typed in phone book on
both so one two three
looks like the Galaxy s3 is populating
the website a little bit faster I see
the logo but um this guy pretty much
caught up the finish pretty much at the
same time I think the loading bar
finished first on the galaxy s3 in this
case but honestly I was too close to
call pretty much just call that at I
will go ahead and load up an application
will look up this iPhone article so one
two three all right really close again I
mean I I couldn't tell the difference
you guys could be the judge of that
you know write down in the comments what
you guys think one maybe I'd have to
rewind it and plate you know again to be
able to see that so let's go to nfl.com
hopefully this website will give us a
better indicator as far as which one's
gonna be faster but you're given the
fact that these guys share the same
processor I'm not sure if the extra gig
of ram is gonna make
that much of difference go ahead and hit
go one two three and in this case it
looks like the galaxy s3 had a good
advantage on here so pretty much our
first separation that we got
accidentally hit an article so let's go
down to the full website so when we hit
desktop at the same time one two three
so all the content a little bit faster
on the one X this guy is done and now
this guy's done so um pretty much I mean
is really really close but maybe the
slight advantage goes to the galaxy s3
that's pretty much it for the speed
prepare some tests hopefully this gives
you a better idea as far as which
application it's gonna be our which
phone is gonna give you a better you
know application experience for our
speed goes and that case is the Galaxy
s3
more than likely it has to do more so
with the extra gig of ram I know that
Samsung does have a little bit more
optimized software at least in the past
it seems that way but anyway that's it
for me and this speed comparison found
it helpful please hit the like button
