and this will be doing a speed
comparison test between the samsung
galaxy s3 this is actually t-mobile's
variant against the HTC One X this is
actually Sprint's EVO 4G LTE variant so
we'll go ahead and start our first test
which is the widow test and then I'll
let you know what other tests will be
running so I'm we do press the power
button at the same time so one two three
hold it for a couple of seconds and let
go now you can see that the galaxy s3 is
showing us the screen first um now we
see it on the HTC One X keep in mind
that the HTC One X doesn't have fast
food enabled you could enable an options
and it would make a lot of a lot faster
but because it doesn't come as factory
default I'm not going to do that and
we'll go ahead and wait and see you know
which one turns on first now while these
guys are loading I'll let you guys know
that the running on the same Wi-Fi
network so we see that the galaxy s3
dead load up the lock screen first we're
still waiting on the One X my cleared
out the browsing history on both of
these devices because I am doing a
browser speed comparison as well so
those are both cleaned out so it's gonna
be a nice even test and even the home
screens are actually equal I you know
don't have any widgets or anything
running in the background they have five
home screens same application shortcuts
on the home screen so let's go ahead and
unlock this guy alright so you can see
the home screens pretty much the same
nothing right in the back down so let's
go ahead and start our first application
speed test and it'll be google earth so
I'll tapping about the same time so one
two three and looks like they load it up
at pretty much exactly the same time I'm
gonna call that one a tie because
honestly it was way too close we'll see
which one actually populates the 3d
buildings first and now you can see it's
the galaxy s3 in this case so the wind
goes to the galaxy s3 because it did r
it is loading up these 3d buildings in
Las Vegas a little bit faster than the
one x is so go ahead and back out of
here and let's go ahead and go to the
next application speed
test which is the dictionary app so one
two three pretty much again at the same
time maybe a split second faster on the
galaxy s3 both of these guys are running
the same processor which is the 1.5
bigger dual-core Snapdragon s4 processor
so it's kind of expected but the galaxy
s3 does have a gig up on the h 2 1 x at
two gigs versus one gig so let's go
ahead and look up the word dog so dog
and i will hit the search button at the
same time if i can so one two three and
pretty much the same time again maybe a
split second faster on the galaxy s3 go
ahead and back on it right now keeping
the apps up open in the background
because we're both running are these
both these phones running android and i
really want to give you a true
experience for us which phone is going
to be faster obviously the actually gig
might give the galaxy s3 in advantage
but we'll go ahead and go on to the next
test which is flixster so i'm gonna tap
these guys at the same time one two
three that was pretty much a tie so go
ahead and back out of here and let's
load up the Play Store one two three a
little bit faster on the galaxy s3 in
this case let's go ahead and load up the
calculator not the calculator just the
Samsung calculator is the HTC calculator
so keep that in mind they're not the
same app unlike these other ones i have
tested so one two three this case the HC
application opened up first so the 1x
got its first one in the app speed test
so open up google maps so one two three
about the same there so back out of here
now let's go ahead and run a quadrant
standard benchmark so I'm go ahead and
close out these applications for the
benchmark so that way you know we get
you know a nice fair benchmark go ahead
and close them out of here like that and
that will run quadrant and I'll just
basically skip through the whole process
a lot of a gas can see the score so
ok so both are done said yes and you can
see the result we got on the samsung
galaxy s3 was a 4920 22 4922 really good
score and on the 1x we got a 47 84 4780
for so slightly higher on the galaxy s3
and what I'm not really surprised by
that considering that the application
speed tests so far haven't been in favor
of the galaxy s three as well so go
ahead and hit home out of here next
application will run is the camera app
so i want to see you know which one's
gonna load up the camera first and you
know which one will let you take the
picture of that you know kodak moment so
let's go ahead and press cam at the same
time so one two three and you can see
the viewfinder i was looking at the
image way before on the HTC One X then
it wasn't the galaxy s3 in this case so
definite advantage goes to the One X and
let's go ahead and do the browser speed
test now so I'm going to leave those two
apps up open in the background will open
up the browser and the first website
we're going to visit of course is going
to be bomble com alright so I loaded
from our typed in foam both on both so
one two three looks like the galaxy s3
is populating the website a little bit
faster I see the logo but um this guy
pretty much caught up the finish pretty
much at the same time I think the
loading bar finished first on the galaxy
s3 in this case but honestly I was too
close to call pretty much just call that
a tie we'll go ahead and load up an
application will look up this iphone
article so one two three alright really
close again I mean I couldn't tell the
difference you guys could be the judge
of that you know write down in the
comments what you guys think one maybe
I'd have to rewind it and plate you know
again to be able to see us so let's go
to NFL com hopefully this website will
give us a better indicator as far as
which one's gonna be faster but you're
given the fact that these guys share the
same processor I'm not sure if the extra
gig of ram is going to be
that much of difference go ahead and hit
go one two three and in this case it
looks like the galaxy s3 had a good
advantage on here so pretty much our
first separation that we got
accidentally hit an article so let's go
down to the full website so when you hit
desktop at the same time one two three
solid contact a little bit faster on the
1x this guy is done and now this guy's
done so um pretty much for me is really
really close but maybe a slight
advantage goes to the galaxy s3 um
that's pretty much it for the speed
comparison test hopefully this gives you
a better idea as far as which
application is going to be our which
phone is going to give you a better you
know application experience for our
speed goes and that case is the galaxy
s3 more than likely it has to do more so
with the extra gig of ram I know that
Samsung does have a little more
optimized software at least in the past
it seems that way but anyway that's it
for me in this speed comparison found it
