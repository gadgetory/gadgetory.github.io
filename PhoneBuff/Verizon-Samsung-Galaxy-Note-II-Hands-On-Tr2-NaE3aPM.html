and in this video I want to give you a
hands-on look at the Verizon version of
the samsung galaxy note 2 first thing
we're taking a look at here is the boot
up animation it's basically your typical
Verizon boot up with 4G LTE branding and
whatnot but that's not really why I'm
doing this video the main reason why I'm
doing this video is because the rise
inversion does differ a lot from the
other versions of the galaxy note 2
mainly because on the home button we
have Verizon branding you know that's
not something we saw in other versions
and you may me now I get personally I
don't really care for it on the back we
have more branding we have a big ol
verizon logo and a big ol 4G LTE logo a
lot bigger than the other carriers and
of course on the bottom we have galaxy
note 2 branding which I don't really
mind that when it comes to the software
side of things the res version does have
a few preloaded apps we have apps like
my verizon mobile mobile hotspot of
course we have Verizon our VZ Navigator
and voicemail when it comes to the
notification bar we have a little bit
more Wireless hollow than we saw on the
s3 mainly you know the AllShare cast
toggle which we didn't see on the s3 but
then that it's pretty similar to the
other versions of galaxy note 2 I
suggest checking out the hands-on video
I did earlier on the channel if you want
to check out you know more of the
details but other than that is pretty
much it for me in this video I just
wanted to show you what the Verizon
version looked like because it was
different of course the s-pen doesn't
have any branding thankfully you know
pretty surprising considering they put
some branding on the home button and you
know such big branding on the back but
anyway that's it for me in this video if
you found it helpful please hit the like
button and subscribe to the channel
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
