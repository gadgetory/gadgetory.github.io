from bomba and in this video we're gonna
be doing a speed comparison test between
not just two devices but two totally
different operating systems on the Left
we have the Samsung Galaxy s3
representing Android jelly bean and on
the right of course we have the z10
running on the brand-new BlackBerry 10
OS now the reason why we're using the S
3 in the z10 here in this video is
because not only can both phones be
considered the flagship device for the
respective operating systems but they
are also nearly identical in hardware
which should give us a pretty good idea
as to which OS is actually faster so
let's get right into it with our first
test where we'll turn on both phones to
see which one loads up it's a
respectable West first while these guys
are loading I'll let you know that both
phones have the same dual-core
Snapdragon s4 processor clocked at 1.5
gigahertz they both also have 2
gigabytes of RAM and are both pushing HD
resolutions on their displays I've also
cleared out the browsing history and
cache on both devices and have them both
connected to the same Wi-Fi network so
it's gonna be as fair as the test as you
could possibly get as we wait it out and
watch the boot up animations on each
smartphone I want to point out something
really cool on the z10 or the BlackBerry
10 OS itself which is it actually gives
you an indicator as to how far the OS is
loaded up so here you can see the s3 did
load up first so it actually wins in the
boot up test we'll go ahead and unlock
it just to make sure that everything is
loaded up fine but going back to what I
was saying about the c10 you'd actually
see the indicator and you press and hold
on the screen you get a percentage which
you know as well about 40% which
obviously is nowhere close to where the
s3 is so the s3 gets a clear one here so
let's go ahead and go on to the next
test alright so the next test we're
doing here is the app speed or
application speed test basically we'll
load up a couple of the same apps or at
least similar apps on both phones to see
which one loads up and runs them faster
so the first app we'll try here is one
of my favorites and that's Flixter keep
in mind that all the apps we're gonna be
testing here are written a bit
differently but these tests still give
you a good idea of the real-world
experience you get with each device so
as you can see the s3 loaded the app a
bit faster than the z10 so go ahead and
tap on the DVD tab to see if it makes a
difference and this time actually the
z10 seemed to finish up first loading up
all the
we details in the thumbnails a little
bit faster so I'll call this test a draw
so the next step I'll test here is gonna
be the score mobile app so go ahead and
tap them at the same time and see which
one actually loads up first so it looks
like the s3 is just about done and we're
still waiting on the c10 and out while
we wait for it to finish loading up I'll
go ahead and take this opportunity to
tell you that Bach really did release a
software update which is supposed to
help with third-party app performance
so basically situations like this and
unfortunately I haven't yet received
that update on my z10 so that's
something to definitely keep in mind but
just in case it makes a dramatic
difference I'll go ahead and test a
couple of native apps and see what the
results are there all right so just to
let you guys know I actually fast
forwarded the last 13 seconds because it
was taking forever to load so I'll go
ahead and back out of here and notice
that we're keeping the apps open the
background to test the multitasking will
open up the native calculators on each
phone and it's up on the s3 and again
we're still waiting on the blackberry
z10 or through blackboard nos it's now
open and honestly if it takes that long
you know every time which it does and
sometimes it loads up faster sometimes
it's slower this case feels slower you
probably better off doing it in your
head as far as the calculation goes so
last app will test here is gonna be the
camera see which one's gonna capture
those Kodak moments s3 already loaded up
and now the z10 and BlackBerry 10 OS is
done so as a whole you could tell that
Android jelly bean
you know loads up applications just a
lot faster than the BlackBerry 10 OS so
with that said let's go ahead and move
on to the next test which is the browser
test to see if we get similar results so
just a reminder I did clear out the
browsing history and cache on both
devices and I also closed out the apps
on both phones as well and I just cuz I
know some of you guys are gonna ask the
brightness is actually set to full on
both phones and both in the browser and
in the settings the difference here
isn't as noticeable in person as it
shows up on camera but nonetheless the
z10 screen is a bit brighter so for all
these browsers which I'm actually be
loading it through Google first so that
was no pre loading going on first site
we're testing here is foam buff and as
you can see they're pretty much
neck-and-neck
and they seem to finish at the same time
so we're actually gonna test these
scrolling so go ahead and scroll up and
down on the s3 and notice that there is
a little bit of white box and going on
but everything
seems to be rather smooth we'll try the
same on the z10 and we are getting a
bunch more skipping but notice that
there isn't any kind of white box and
going on so that might be the reason why
the performance seems to be a little bit
worse but nonetheless I said the s3 is
definitely smoother and loading up this
next article we're seeing the content
first on the z10 and it looks like the
z10 is done s3 is still loading so when
goes to the z10 here for foam buff we'll
go ahead and go to another site so next
site we test is gonna be in gadget will
go ahead and tap on them at the same
time and see which one actually loads at
first so again the z10 actually shows
the content first and seems to finish
loading up first as well as far as the
status bar goes we'll try the scrolling
again here and not that much content
going on so pretty smooth on both
devices actually so we'll go ahead and
try an article here and pretty much
consistently we're seeing the content
first on the c10 it seems loaded up
maybe just a split second faster than
the s3 so let's go ahead and try another
site so the third and final website will
test it's gonna be the verge so go ahead
and tap on the links at the same time
and again we see the content maybe a
millisecond faster in the c10 compared
to the s3 honestly milliseconds don't
really matter you know if the difference
is in a couple of seconds then it
doesn't really matter and you'll never
notice it unless you're using the
devices side by side click an article
you get the same result but so far we've
only tested mobile sites so it's go
ahead and load the full version website
to see if that makes a difference so
we'll go ahead and tap on the full site
link on the verge and actually the verge
is one of the better websites to test
because their full site has so much
content and so much media that it really
gives you a good idea as far as the
capabilities of each device here and you
can see we're seeing the content first
on the z10 which has pretty much been
the theme and seems to be just about
done on the s3 now we're seeing the
content be some of the thumbnails still
haven't loaded up now they seem to have
loaded up so definitely a more
significant difference in the z10
compared to last test but you can see
the scrolling here it's not even
responding to my touch until you know a
couple of swipes and swiping is not
necessarily the smoothest but it's not
that bad either on the s3
responds right away and definitely a
much smoother scrolling experience so
the theme general with the browsers go
that you maybe get a millisecond
a couple of seconds faster on Z 10s
words loading times go but on the s3
you're getting a much smoother scrolling
experience
alright guys that's our speed comparison
test between the z10 and the galaxy s3
again what's interesting here is that
these two devices are very close in
terms of hardware so we really got to
see the differences in speed
optimizations from each OS and overall
we found that Android just runs faster
than the box rates an OS especially when
it comes to app performance of course
BlackBerry could fix this problem with a
couple of updates just like Android did
with project butter and jelly bean but
for now Android is the winner here and
that's pretty much it for me in this
video so if you guys liked it please
give it a thumbs up and be sure to
