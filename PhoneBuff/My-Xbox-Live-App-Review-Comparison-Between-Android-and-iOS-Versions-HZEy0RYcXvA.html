this video I'm doing a review on the
just released my xbox live app on
Android and also be comparing it to the
iOS version which got some new features
of its own so go ahead and sign in I
don't know if you guys heard that little
sign-in sound sounds just like the Xbox
when you select something I'm on the
expo itself you're taken to this home
screen which is spotlight featured
videos that you can watch you can swipe
over to the right and you have your
social tap here you'll see your avatar
for your Xbox Live account your little
motto you have your friends list right
here so you could tap on this guy and
see which friends are online and when
they last logged in you could hit your
messages and you know listen to any
messages you have or you can even send a
message by hitting this little send
envelope right here at the bottom you
could send a message to with our friends
so for example if I wanted to send a
message to this guy or multiple ones I
can just check them like that I'll sit
check for one and you know I can just
type my message in here so pretty cool
functionality well this is this little X
right now the back out of here another
thing you have is the ability to edit
your avatar so I can hit this little
icon right here with a shirt tap it and
you can see it gives me options to edit
my avatar so he's gonna run on-screen
any second there you go I could edit you
know his style and you know change what
closes wearing head wear all that good
stuff that you guys are used to with
that sports live I'll go ahead and back
out of here and I'll show you the next
tab and the next tab is just basically
your recent games and your achievements
so you can see you know my achievements
and what they hit minesweeper you know
you can just tap on pretty much any game
see what your achievements are what
you've uh you know done with that game
and it's taken a while to load see if it
finishes loading so you can see that
little icon right here showing that it's
still loading up in the background it's
taking pretty long so it's gonna back
out of here but anyway that's pretty
much all you have on the Xbox version of
the app you know you have your spotlight
future videos your social tab and then
your game so its pretty cool me you'll
be able to listen your messages and uh
or send messages you're able to see what
friends are online and also you're able
to see your recent game
but on the iOS version what it has is so
let me go ahead and unlock this guy so I
already have the app opened up on the
home screen is similar to that spotlight
screen on the Xbox version or I'm sorry
the Android version but if you swipe
over to the right you have your same
social so you have the same options here
and then uh your recent games but what's
different on the iOS version is when you
go over again you have this quick play
option so this actually lets you control
your Xbox through your phone so I could
just tap on connect to xbox it's gonna
connect to my xbox I don't know if you
guys heard that noise in the background
but that's my Xbox and you choose
something to start so for example if I
wanted to do the ESPN app I could go
ahead and tap on that guy and it
actually turns into a remote control so
I could actually control you know what's
going on on my xbox from here so it
actually works really well you know very
little lag here on high-speed Internet
at least I'm connected to Wi-Fi so it's
gonna work fine um I definitely like it
you know for being able to watch movies
or you know using the ESPN app and
watching game on ESPN being able to
pause it and things like that all from
my phone instead of using the controller
is definitely definitely really cool the
Android version like I said doesn't have
this yet but you know it's just a
initial release so I expected to get it
sometime in the future but definitely
cool functionality other than that the
iOS version just has a Discoverer page
where it has some of the things that you
see on the Xbox Live dashboard where you
know the Android version doesn't have it
so anyway that's pretty much it for me
