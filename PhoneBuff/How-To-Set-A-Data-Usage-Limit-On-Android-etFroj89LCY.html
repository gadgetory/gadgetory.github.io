bumble calm and in this video I'm gonna
show you how to take control over your
phone's data usage if your on versions
4.0 or higher of Android so the reason
why that's important is because a lot of
times carriers nowadays are charging you
extra if you go over your data limit say
2 gigabytes for example so obviously you
want to be able to do this and the way
you do it is go over to your settings
like I just did and you're going to tap
on this data usage option right over
here so you tap on it it brings you to
this screen so I haven't set any limits
just yet but let's say for example I
have 2 gigabytes available this yellow
line or orange line is a warning so
let's say I want my phone to warn me
when I reach 1 point 5 gigabytes to let
me know hey you're getting close to your
limit this red line is the absolute
limit now right now I can't do anything
because it's not enabled to enable it
you have to check this little box right
here and then hit OK and now you can see
I could actually move this guy around so
I'm just going to move it down to 2
gigabytes and what this will do is
completely shut off my internet once I
reach the 2 gigabyte mark so it's
definitely a great way to avoid getting
charged another great thing about this
feature is you have a or a list of apps
right over here that determines how much
data each app is using so let's say for
example I want to limit my CNN app from
using data so it's going to use 3
megabytes in this cycle so far but I
could I could actually click on it and
see how much of the data or how the data
is being used so for right now for
example most of the data is in the
foreground meaning when the apps
actually open and I'm actually using it
but there is some background usage about
43 kilobytes I could actually restrict
that background usage and some apps will
be higher than this one especially we
have a widget or why not and you hit
this little restrict background usage
and hit OK and what it does is
completely blocks out the apps data
usage unless you actually physically
open the app yourself so definitely
another cool feature and another great
way to make sure that your phone isn't
wasting data when it doesn't need to be
alright that's pretty much it for this
video this is David for calm
thanks for watching it and don't forget
