and today I'm going to show you how to
send a certain contacts phone calls
straight to voicemail
so say you're trying to ignore someone
and they keep calling you you could
actually direct all their phone calls
automatically to your voicemail without
your phone even ringing so in order to
do it you're going to want to find the
contact in your contact book so go into
your contacts or people or whatever your
phone calls it find the contact that you
want to send all calls to voicemail so
in this case I'll do Alex Green and so
from here my phone gives me option right
here which says send a voicemail so I
could turn it on says are you sure you
want to send all the calls voicemail and
hit OK and from now on whenever Alex
green calls me all his calls will go
straight to voicemail and a warning from
bug me on your phone it might be a
little bit different you might have to
press menu and hit edit and then kind of
scroll down and there's probably going
to be a little checkbox for you to check
in order to send calls to voicemail but
pretty much it's very similar process
alright that's it for me thanks for
watching the video don't forget to visit
fumble comm for more cellphone news
reviews and how to's thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
