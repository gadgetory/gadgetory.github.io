in this video we're gonna be doing a
speed comparison test between the play
edition of the galaxy s4 which runs on
pure stock Android just like on Nexus
devices and the regular version of the
galaxy s4 which runs on Samsung's
TouchWiz modified version of the OS now
before we begin I want to let you guys
know that I've been wanting to do a
speed test like this for a really long
time I mean almost every time I've
tested an Android phone I've wondered to
myself whether or not the phone would be
faster if it's running on stock Android
compared to a manufacturer skinned I've
always felt like stock Android was a
little bit faster or just a little less
laggy than manufactured UIs and now for
the first time ever we can actually put
that idea to the test with identical
phones with identical hardware with the
only difference being the official
version of their software so in the boot
up test you can see the Play edition of
the galaxy s4 on the left side shows us
the lockscreen first we'll go ahead and
unlock it and just after the TouchWiz
version loads up so for the first test
you have to give the nod to the Play
edition so the next test we run here is
the application speed test note that
both of these phones have actually been
factory reset with just a couple of apps
installed for the purpose of this video
so first app will test here is Flixter
and you can see pretty much identical
load of times considering that they have
identical specs not all that surprising
tapping on the listing you see maybe a
little bit faster on the Play edition
tapping play trailer and we see at first
on the samsung version so a little bit
of mixed results pretty much had to call
that one a tie next up we'll test here
is going to be score centered so tap
them at the same time and once again you
see the content loaded up maybe a split
second faster on the Play edition of the
s4 same thing happened with the Flickr
app so we'll tap on videos and see if
there's a recurring theme going on so
let's hop on this video here at the same
time and yeah the video loaded up faster
on the TouchWiz version just like a date
with Flixter so seems like for whatever
reason videos are a little bit faster on
the TouchWiz version and when it comes
to loading up content at least within
apps seems to be a little bit faster on
the Play edition we'll go ahead and load
up this article just so we could be sure
and seems to be taking a little bit
longer than usual but yeah so there you
go you can see that the content did
little first on the Play edition and you
know video loads up first on the
TouchWiz version so
again mixed results so overall I have to
say it's a tie so with the app speed
tests out of the way let's go ahead and
run some good old-fashioned benchmarks
so the first benchmark we're going to be
running here is going to be Geekbench -
and as you can see the Play edition of
the galaxy s4 scored a 3243
which is just slightly higher than the
3214 scored on the TouchWiz version so
very very close just like this pretty
much this whole test has been but the
slight edge here does go to the Play
edition and the next benchmark we're
going to be running is gonna be in tune
- and as you can see here the Play
edition finished first with a score of
twenty-five thousand two hundred and
twenty eight which is again just
slightly higher than the twenty-five
thousand and ninety four on the TouchWiz
version so close once again but the edge
does go to the Play edition which has
sort of been the theme so far okay so
before we wrap up this video let's go
ahead and do a quick browser test here
so the browser we're going to be using
is Google Chrome on both phones so that
way it's nice and fair clear out the
browsing history and cache on both and
they're connected in the same Wi-Fi
network so screen as fair as possible so
the first website we're going to be
testing is of course fumble comm and so
far they look like they're neck-and-neck
I mean really really close we're seeing
the content a little bit faster on the
Play edition once again and that one is
really close you guys could be the judge
of that one I'll go ahead and tap on
this article here and hopefully we get
some more separation between the two and
so this time the status bar says that
the play Edition is done significantly
faster than the TouchWiz version but
honestly they both look like they're
done loading so again it was really
close if I have to give the edge it's
going to be of course to the Play
edition but let's go ahead and try
another website the next site we're
going to be testing is the verge so
we're gonna go to the mobile site first
here and so far it looks like the
TouchWiz version is actually loading it
up faster so we'll go ahead and tap on
this article here and that one I don't
think you get closer to the side than
that one scrolling I'm not necessarily
smooth I mean they're smooth but there's
some white blank space there on both of
them so that was pretty much at I go
into the full site we're seeing the
content first on the TouchWiz version
but it looks like the content finished
loading
up first on the plate Asian so honestly
I mean I think it's just too close to
call but that's pretty much how it's
been throughout this whole entire
speedtest I mean in one area the play
addition is faster and in another the
TouchWiz version is faster and overall
you're going to get a very similar
experience in terms of speed with either
of these two devices but I will say that
the play edition of the s4 seems to
offer a more consistent speed experience
compared to the TouchWiz version not
only because of what we saw on this test
here but with my personal experience
with these two devices I have noticed a
bit of lag from time to time on my
galaxy s4 with TouchWiz which is kind of
hard to rub create in a video but
definitely something worth noting but
that's pretty much it for me in this
video if you found it helpful please
