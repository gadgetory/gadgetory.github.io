bluff and in this video i'm going to be
going over what i consider to be the top
5 features on the samsung galaxy note 3
now i'm not going to be going over just
any features because as we all know
samsung loves the jam-packed the phones
with them so instead we'll be focusing
on the features that really make the
note 3 stand out from the rest of the
competition and would probably end up
being the main reasons why you would opt
to get to note 3 over just about any
other smartphone if you're to go that
route so without any further ado let's
go ahead and get right into it so the
first out feature on the Galaxy Note 3
is the most obvious one and that's that
big 5.7 inch Super AMOLED display but it
doesn't make the list just because it's
big I mean there are plenty of other
phones out there that rock screens that
are as big or even bigger than the one
on the note 3 so instead the note 3
screen makes lists for a couple of other
reasons for one the sharpness and
clarity of the screen itself is just
downright amazing the Full HD 1080p
resolution gives you a pixel density
that's so high it's higher than what the
human eye can even perceive so the
sharpness of the note 3 screen is just
about as good as it gets
the second reason the screen makes list
is the beautiful Super AMOLED technology
behind it now this is the same type of
screen that was found on the galaxy s4
which gives you awesome contrast and
deep blacks but with the note 3 Sampson
was able to improve on it by making it
brighter especially with the whites
which makes outdoor visibility a lot
better top feature number 2 has to do
with this screen again but this time
it's with this biggest drawback think
about the number one reason why people
will look at the note 3 and say they
probably wouldn't buy it from my
experience and the people I've asked
it's typically the screen is too big or
the phone itself is just too big
well Samsung recognizes this problem and
was able to do something about it last
year in the note 2 we saw a feature
where if you apps like the keyboard and
calculator can be resized and moved to
either the right or the left edge of the
screen making it easier to reach well
with the note 3 Samsung took it to the
next level and made it possible to
easily resize the whole screen as in the
entire screen no matter what app or page
you're looking at with a simple swipe in
and out from the edge of the
screen you can resize it down from the
full five point seven inches to anywhere
between 3.5 and four point five inches
diagonally whoever said you can't have
your cake and eat it too the third top
feature on the note 3 is the one that
really separates it from just about any
other smartphone out there in the S Pen
I've said this once and I'll say it
again the S Pen isn't just the stylus
it's actually a whole different method
of input with its ultra precise tip and
over a thousand levels of pressure
sensitivity yes one can just do things
that an ordinary stylus or your fingers
for that matter just can the S Pen also
comes packed with a bunch of software
features that take full advantage of it
like s note which in my opinion is the
best note-taking app available on any
smartphone handwriting recognition which
lets you write out what you want to type
and screen right which lets you draw
right on the screen that you're looking
at the S Pen also has a good chunk of
developer support meaning you download
some apps and games that are made
specifically for it and maybe best of
all Samsung has finally found a way to
make some of the S pen's most useful
features all easily accessible and
therefore more practical with Air
Command which pops up as soon as you
take the S Pen out of the phone top
feature number four has to be that long
lasting battery on the note 3 with its
30 200,000,000 capacity the note 3 will
easily last you all day long with
moderate to heavy use and depending on
how you use it could actually last even
longer than that we're talking one and a
half to two days here the cool thing
what the note 3 is not only does the
battery last a really long time it's
also removable so you can swap it out
with the fully charged spare if you have
it and if you don't but you're near by a
computer you can charge it at a much
faster rate than your typical smartphone
thanks to the note 3's USB 3.0 charging
port the fifth stop feature on the
Galaxy Note 3 is this feature proof
specs now we all know that technology
moves really quickly and there will
always be better SPECT bones just around
the corner but on a device like the note
3 with respects being so cutting-edge
right now
in a year or two down the line the note
3 won't necessarily feel as outdated as
some of its competition just look at
some of the things the note 3 brings to
the table and you'll see why like I
mentioned earlier the note 3 has USB 3.0
support which was the first on any smart
phone the note 3 can also record videos
in 4k
a resolution which again was a first on
any smartphone and to complete the
trifecta the note 3 has three gigabytes
of RAM instead of your typical to which
you guessed it was the first on any
smartphone by bringing these features
first alongside with us other really
high-end specs like its powerful
quad-core processor and 1080p display
the note 3 is ahead of the curve in
terms of technology right now so it'll
take a little bit longer than most
phones before it starts falling behind
that curve which is important especially
when you're stuck on a multi-year
contract
