and who doesn't like a rematch.
Today, we have not the Snapdragon,
but the Exynos variant of the Galaxy S7
going head to head with the
reigning speed test champ
in the Iphone 6S plus.
Last time, the Iphone put the smack down
on the Snapdragon variant of the S7.
So, the question is, will
the global Exynos variant
redeem Samsung latest flagship.
Let's go ahead and find out.
Okay, so we'll kick this
thing of by starting
the stopwatches on each phone
and then jump into this
all new obstacle course.
Where the Galaxy 7 and
it's quick animations
gets the jump over the Iphone 6S plus
but that lead doesn't last for long
with the Iphone just
ripping through Subway Surf
and already moving on to Truescape.
So, for those of you that
saw the last speed test
where we put the Exynos S7
against the Snapdragon S7,
you know that the Exynos
version flat out dominated.
So, it will be interesting
to see how it does here
against the Iphone which
just embarrassed the Snapdragon version
in an earlier speed test
and so far, it's keeping
up with the Iphone,
only being one app behind.
So, there is still time for a comeback
and that comeback may
just be during this part
on Lapse It, where both phones
have to create a time lapse
from the same exact video file
but, two cores or not,
the Iphone blazed through
Lapse It at what looks like what was
a much faster rate than
the eight core Galaxy S7,
putting it a full two apps
ahead in this speed test.
So, if the Galaxy S7 is
going to make a comeback,
it's gonna have to do it soon
as the Iphone 6S plus has proven
that it can handle multitasking
without breaking a sweat
in the second lap.
Which speaking of, the Iphone
6S plus is about to enter
with it finishing the first lap with time
of one minute and 12 seconds
with the Galaxy S7 right behind it,
clocking in eight
seconds later with a time
of one minute and 20.
So, in this second lap,
it usually comes down
to which phone can keep more apps ready
to go in the background.
But because of the lead
the Iphone built for itself
in that first lap, even if
the S7 had all the apps ready,
it will still take the Iphone fumbling
on at least one app in
order for the S7 to pull up
a last minute comeback
and as you can see,
that didn't happen here,
with the Iphone having
most of the apps ready,
racing it to the finish
line with a total time
of one minute and 45 seconds
and while the Galaxy S7 did
good in this second lap,
it wasn't quite good enough
with it finishing ten seconds
later with a total time of
one minute and 55 seconds.
Alright, alright.
So, the Exynos S7 was eight
seconds slower in the first lap
and only two seconds
slower in the second lap,
making it the loser but
a respectable loser.
Which is something you couldn't really say
about the Snapdragon variant.
But nonetheless, the winner
and still Fumble Style
Speed Test champ is the Iphone 6s plus.
Thank you guys for watching
and as always, I'll see you
in the very next episode.
