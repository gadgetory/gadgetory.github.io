speed test that you guys have been
asking for like you've been asking you
for it a lot I've been reading the
comments and I get it while the iPhone
success was dethroned by the iPhone 7 it
technically never lost a speed test
champ title to a competitor so today
we're taking Apple's flagship smartphone
from all the way back in 2015 and
putting it up against Samsung's 2017
flagship in the Galaxy S II well the
iPhone success finally be defeated will
it go on to race another day let's find
out looking for a protective case for
your iPhone 7 the Evo tactical extreme
from tech 21 offers the best possible
protection without the extra bulk see
what happened when we put it up against
the OtterBox at the link below
ok so you know the drill we'll start the
stopwatch is on each phone and then jump
right into the first row of system apps
where right off the bat the Galaxy s8
quicker animations allow it to take lead
making those animations on the iPhone
success looks luggage in comparison but
it's not just the animations that have
given the essays belief with the iPhone
success taking considerably longer - a
little gray slug but it does a better
job at loading Photoshop putting it hot
on the heels of the s8 as both are now
working on lapses where it'll be
interesting to see if the iPhone success
can make a comeback here but know from
the looks of it the essay process that
time-lapse at a slightly faster rate
allowing it to keep its lead as both
phones move on to subway surfers now
historically it's the heavy duty apps
like Photoshop lapses and games where
the iPhone has the advantage and that
seems to be the case here with the
iPhone making a comeback as both phones
are neck-and-neck heading into flip
diving where the iPhone success actually
takes lead moving on to cross the road
but the Galaxy s8 is still right there
behind it so we'll see if we can take a
lead right back but no it looks like the
iPhone success will not only keep its
lead but it actually improved upon it as
it finishes up with Crossy Road and
starts working on bullet port so as the
Galaxy S II finishes up with Crossy Road
and moves on to bullet force the iPhone
6s finishes up with bullet ports and
moves on to the last row where there are
four additional lightweight apps which
may actually open the door for the S
to make a comeback here we go the sa
joins the success on Valastro but
unfortunately it will Spotify at a
slower rate the s8 also loads ESPN at a
slower rate as it does the Netflix app
so it's important to note that it isn't
just games where the success can have
the edge with it finishing the first
stop of the time of 1 minute and 34
seconds with the s8 finishing seven
seconds later with a time of one minute
and 41 seconds as both balls worked away
back up to the top here in the second
lap the faster animations on the s8
could actually allow it to make a
comeback if it's four gigabytes of RAM
can keep more apps open in the
background than the iPhone 6s is two
gigabytes of RAM but heartbreaker the s8
failed to keep subway surfers open so
it's only real hope is that the iPhone
success somehow stumbles here in the
second map which so far it hasn't but
going into the calendar app the success
didn't keep the calendar entry we
started open in memory and it also
didn't keep the gallery open blowing it
down but not enough for the essay to
make a comeback
with a success finishing with a total
time of 2 minutes and 17 seconds while
after failing to keep Photoshop snapchat
and Facebook open the s8 does manage to
keep the counter entry stored in memory
finishing this piece has 14 seconds
later with a total time of 2 minutes and
31 seconds making the winner from 2015
the iPhone 6s take a look at the
individual app load of times from the
first lab you can see that while the
Galaxy s8 beat this success in 5 apps
the success actually BCS 8th in a total
of 10 apps which in addition is the
second map contributed to its victory
here anyways that is it for me in this
video thank you guys for watching and as
always I'll see you in the very next
episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
