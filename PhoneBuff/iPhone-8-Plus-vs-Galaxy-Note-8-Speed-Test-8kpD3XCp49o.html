test you have all been waiting for is
finally here today it's the big boys
from both Apple and Samsung going at it
in the iPhone 8 plus versus the Galaxy
Note 8 now taking a look at the spec
sheets both of these phones are packing
some serious power the iPhone 8 plus has
apples all new a 11 Bionic ship while
the Galaxy Note 8 comes with a whopping
6 gigabytes of RAM so it's gonna be an
interesting one will the iPhone 8 plus
continue Apple's dominance in these
speed tests or will the note 8 pull off
the upset let's find out learn all about
the iPhone and how it came to be in the
one device a book that reveals the
secret history of the phone that changed
the world with exclusive interviews with
some of the engineers and developers who
helped build it listen to it for free
with your 30 day audible trial at the
link below
all right so we'll kick things off by
starting the stopwatches on each phone
and then jump right into the first row
of system apps where right off the bat
the note 8 gets to step over the iPhone
already moving on to the second row and
pulling a full app ahead early on in
this speed test with the iPhone falling
even further behind loading both
Facebook and snapchat at a slower rate
but the note 8 did seem to struggle
there a bit with Photoshop which opens
the door for the iPhone to cut into its
lead with it now joining the note in
lapses but it wasn't for long as the
note 8 just ripped through lapse it and
moves on to the gaming row with the
iPhone 8 plus hot on its heels trying to
make a comeback but the node 8 is able
to hold on to its lead if only by a half
step with both phones now neck and neck
as they work on flip diving so let's see
if the note a can create some separation
again here and no the iPhone 8 plus
actually takes the lead as both phones
move ahead to fit the fat all right so
we'll see if the iPhone 8 plus can add
on to his newly found lead here and fit
the fats and yeah it looks like the
iPhone loaded it up at a slightly faster
rate but nothing too big as both balls
move on to bullet force where this time
the difference is much bigger with the
iPhone leaving the node 8 behind as it
starts working on the apps in the last
row with it now actually being a full
app ahead of the note 8 however the note
does manage to load Spotify at a faster
rate which cuts into the iPhones lead
and it looks like it
manages to load ESPN at a fast rate so
the nori is closing in quick on the
iPhone late here in the first lap with
it joining it and loading both mobile
and the full versions of the Amazon
website where the iPhone finishes first
with the time of 1 minute and 27 seconds
with the note 8 coming in just three
seconds later with a time of 1 minute
and 30 all right so this is where it'll
get interesting will the 6 gigabytes of
RAM be enough for the note 8 to keep all
the apps open and can the note eight
possibly make a comeback the iPhone has
kept all of the apps open so far without
any issue but it stutters on subway
surfers with no date having it open and
ready to go allowing it to take the lead
late here in the second lap so at this
point it's the note aides race lose with
all I having to do is keep the rest of
the apps open and so far so good with it
keeping the calendar the gallery and the
camera apps all ready to go
allowing the no-date to finish first
with the time of 2 minutes and 1 seconds
with the iPhone 8 plus failing to keep
the last three apps ready to go causing
it to finish 6 seconds later at the time
of 2 minutes and 7 seconds making the
winner the Galaxy Notes 8 all right so
really interesting results right like
while I'm impressed about the
performance from the Galaxy Note 8 I am
somewhat surprised by the performance
from the iPhone 8 plus I was honestly
expecting it to be a lot faster
especially given what we saw last year
with the iPhone 7 plus but who knows
maybe Apple is working on a software
update to help speed things up and if
they do come out with such an update
we'll be sure to do a rematch now before
we take a look at the individual app
load of times I want to give a big
thanks to audible for sponsoring today's
video audible is the best way to listen
to audiobooks like I've been using them
for years now and pretty much anytime
I'm in my car I'm listening to a book on
audible and some of my favorite features
are things like speed control where you
can adjust how fast a book is read back
to you I personally listen to everything
at one point 5x which you know some
people who get in my car say it's too
fast but I love it because it lets me
get to my books just so much faster
another great feature is the ability to
save clips so if you hear an interesting
fact in the book that you're reading you
can actually save that specific clip and
go back to it later audible has a huge
selection of books that you can choose
from the one I'm reading right now is
the one device a book that uncovers the
secret history of the iPhone with
exclusive interviews with the engineers
the developers who actually helped build
it so if you're into tech even if you're
not an iPhone fan it's definitely a book
that I'd recommend checking out and the
best part is you can listen to it or any
other book that you want for free with
your 30-day trial at audible.com slash
phone buff or by clicking on that link
down below in the description so check
it out alright here are the individual
app little times from the first slap
where the note eights beat the iPhone
eight plus and pretty much all the
lightweight apps but where the iPhone
got the edge in the more heavy-duty apps
obviously the iPhone stumbled in the
second lap making the note eight the
faster phone overall anyways that is it
for me in this video thank you guys for
watching and as always I'll see you in
the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
