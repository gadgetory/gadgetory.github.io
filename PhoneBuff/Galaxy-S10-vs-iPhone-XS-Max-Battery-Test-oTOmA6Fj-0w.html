we've already done the drop test now
it's time to do the foam buff style
battery test between the galaxy s 10
plus and the iPhone 10 s max taking a
look at the spec sheet the SN plus has a
six point four inch display which due to
popular demand we've set to its native
3k resolution the version of the S 10
that we're testing here has a Snapdragon
855 under the hood and it's all being
powered by a massive 4100 million power
battery the iPhone on the other hand has
a 6.5 inch display with a 2k resolution
powered of course by Apple's own a 12th
Bionic chip and it has a relatively
small three thousand one hundred and
seventy-four million power battery of
course specs are just specs right like
that's why we've run these tests so with
that said let's go ahead and get right
into it
just like we do for the speed test and
drop tests we'll be updating the
official battery test rankings on our
websites which we created easily with
the sponsor for today's video in Wix
with Wix you can tap into the power of
your smart phone by building your own
website using artificial design
intelligence just answer a few questions
upload some of your photos and pick a
theme that best matches your style and
then have AI do the rest building you a
professional website that looks great on
mobile and on desktop click on that
special link down below to start your
own website for free all right so we'll
kick things off with the phone test
where we're making a one-hour phone call
on each phone using the same exact SIM
card in the same exact location to help
make things even more accurate we've
also installed a cell tower in the lab
to help reduce any issues with reception
we have a robot covering the proximity
sensor for the majority of the test here
and we have consistent audio playing on
the other end of the call both of which
better simulate how a phone call is
actually made in the real world after
one hour the iPhone did pretty well with
its battery dropping only 3% to 97
whereas the galaxy's battery took a
bigger hit dropping down to 94% but we
still have plenty of tests to go so
we'll see if the iPhone can hold on to
its early lead as we head into the
messaging test where we have our robot
typing in a string of letters and
suggestions before sending off a text we
have the same set of responses from our
chat bot coming back from the other end
simulating a real-world text messaging
conversation considering that we're
looking at bright white displays here it
is worth noting that we've calibrated
the displays on both phones precisely to
200 nits to ensure that we aren't
penalizing a display for being brighter
after one hour the galaxy has 10 pluses
battery drops by only 8% whereas the
iPhones battery fell by 11% making it
all even after the messaging test with
both phones at 86% as we move on to the
email test we're opening the same set of
emails on
each phone and scrolling through each
one of these opened emails a few times
before returning to the inbox and
repeating the tasks the email apps on
each phone are freshly installed so each
email is being loaded for the first time
to best simulate how you read your
emails in real life after one hour of
going through emails the galaxy has ten
plus is able to take the lead with its
battery dropping down only to 79% with
the iPhones battery dropping all the way
down to 74 percent we'll see if the sm+
can add onto its lead here in the
browser test where each phone will
randomly cycle through the same set of
web sites every 30 seconds we're also
adding in a scroll through each one of
these web pages to better simulate how
you actually browse the web and after
repeating this process for an entire
hour the galaxy ascent plus is beginning
to run away with it with it now eight
percentage points ahead at 69% compared
to just 61 percent on the iPhone we'll
see if the iPhone can somewhat stop the
bleeding here in Instagram where we'll
be scrolling through the home feed
scrolling through the feed not only
ensures that new content is constantly
being loaded in the app but it also
accounts for the phone having to process
those constant swipes which have an
effect on battery and after one hour of
scrolling through the feed the galaxy
sm+ is now at 60 percent battery with
the iPhone 10 percent lower at 50
percent
now the next test here is the standby
test last time we had standby slated for
the end of the entire battery test but
we quickly realized that most phones
weren't going to reach it so for this
updated version of the fump of cell
battery test we've placed standby rights
in the middle since standby is such a
key part of battery life so after 16
hours of each phone being on standby
with the SIM card still in there to
better reflect real-world usage the
iPhone is able to make a dramatic
comeback with its battery falling by
only 8% over those 16 hours compared to
the 16 percent drop on the galaxy s 10
plus putting the iPhone only two
percentage points behind as we move on
to the YouTube test so in this test each
phone will play the same set of YouTube
videos
in addition to the screens being equally
calibrated we also made sure to
calibrate the speaker volumes on each
phone within one decibel point of each
other to make sure that things are nice
and even and after one hour of YouTube
binge watching the galaxy of 10 plus is
able to reestablish itself with this
battery level dropping down to 33% with
the iPhone falling down to 28% putting
it by percentage points behind of course
with the gaming test being next the
iPhone has the opportunity to flex the
efficiency of its 812 Bionic chip and
possibly make the comeback we're playing
Altos adventure here with our robot
tapping the screen on each phone every
few seconds to simulate how you play the
game in real life and after one hour of
gaming the sn+ and its snapdragon 855
end up outperforming the iPhone once
again dropping 12 percentage points to
21 percent battery compared to the 14
percentage point drop on the iPhone that
put its battery at 14 percent moving on
to the Maps tests we're simulating
navigation here by having GPS turned on
on each phone having them actively check
for real-time traffic information and by
swiping on the screen every few seconds
to keep the map moving now this isn't a
perfect simulation of navigation in the
real world
considering that you don't get as many
auditory cues for each new turn but in
our test we did find it to be pretty
close to the real thing and it's still
an accurate indicator of how devices
perform relatively by the way the iPhone
sees its battery level drop all the way
down to 1% just barely making it to the
end while the s 10 plus still has plenty
of juice remaining at 11 percent battery
so we'll see how long it takes for the
iPhone to die as we head into Spotify
and there you go as soon as we launched
the first song the iPhone powered down
we'll go ahead and fast-forward the s 10
plus where its battery died just 30
seconds short of completing the one hour
Spotify test so with both bones out of
juice the iPhones total test time was
almost exactly 24 hours when you include
the 16-hour standby while the galaxy s
10 plus lasted one hour longer at 25
hours making the winner of this battery
test
the galaxy as 10-plus we'll be updating
our battery test rankings after every
test on our website which we created
easily with our sponsor wix's drag and
drop editor anyways that is it for me in
this video thank you guys for watching
and as always I'll see you in the very
next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
