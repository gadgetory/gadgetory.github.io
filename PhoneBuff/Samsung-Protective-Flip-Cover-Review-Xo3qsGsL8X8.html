bluff and in this video we're doing a
review on the flip covers from Samsung
and we have seen these guys in the
commercials for the galaxy s3 are the
Galaxy Note 2 and you may have been
wondering yourself are they worth
picking up and are they worth your
hard-earned dollars so in this video I'm
gonna go over the pros and cons and I've
noticed when personally using these guys
and help you decide whether or not it's
weren't putting on your Galaxy phone
I'll start off with the cons because
whenever possible I do like ending my
reviews on a positive note so right off
the bat the first thing I didn't like
about the flip cover was the fact that
it couldn't easily access the volume
rocker with the flip cover opened you
have to either use your left hand to
adjust the volume or use the sound
toggle in the notification bar which is
a minor inconvenience but the good thing
is that if you flip the cover all the
way back the volume rocker will be
exposed again which pretty much
eliminates this problem but I still
think it's a con worth mentioning the
2nd drawback is because you'll naturally
want to flip the cover all the way back
the rear camera will be blocked as a
result so if you want to take a picture
you have to keep the lid open which
makes holding the phone a little bit
awkward but then again people take
pictures with an iPad so maybe it isn't
all that bad the third thing I which was
different about the flow cover was the
way it interacts with the screen or in
this case the lack of it when you close
the lid nothing happens I would have
really liked to see it turn the screen
off because if I close the lid chances
are i'm not going to be looking at the
screen it's not a deal breaker by any
means but it's still something that
would have been nice to see in the last
drawback which may or may not be a
deal-breaker for you is the fact that it
wasn't designed for left-handed users so
if you hold your phone with your left
hand the flip cover could get really
annoying really quick okay now with all
that out of the way let's talk about
what I like about this thing first off
and most obvious I like the way the flip
cover protects the screen the inside of
the cover is made of a microfiber type
material that not only helps protect the
screen but it also cleans it too if you
move it side to side the second thing i
really like is the fact that the cover
only adds three millimeters to the
thickness of the phone which isn't even
noticeable this is possible not only
because the latest then but because the
flip cover replaces your existing
battery door so it doesn't add any
thickness to the back and because it
replaces the battery door the third
benefit is that it still fully supports
NFC the fourth pro is that when you flip
the lid all the way back it seems to
amplify the speaker volume a bit just
when you cup your hand around the phone
speaker in the fifth benefit which is
also my favorite is that the flip cover
could act as a kickstand holding the
phone up right when on a grippy surface
it doesn't work too well on smooth
surfaces but the workaround to this is
putting something with some weight on
the lid and then laying the phone back
against it overall I give the samsung
flip cover a thumbs up what isn't the
most inexpensive option out there it
does offer some unique benefits that can
make it worthwhile investment so that
pretty much wraps up this review if you
