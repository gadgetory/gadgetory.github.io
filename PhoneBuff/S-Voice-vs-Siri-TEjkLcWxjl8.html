and in this video we're doing a
comparison between s voice on the
Samsung Galaxy s3 and Siri on the Apple
iPhone 4s so basically asking each voice
assistant a couple of questions to see
how they respond and I want you guys to
pay attention to how quickly the each
voice assistant responds and also how
accurately of course because ultimately
those are the two things that you really
are looking for with the voice assistant
so let's go ahead and start our first
test ask for something like weather
what's the weather like so we got the
weather forecasts on both one loaded up
a little bit faster on Siri than it did
on s voice but pretty good for both of
them so let's go ahead and ask another
question who is the president of Brazil
got the answer here and we got the
answer here so this is splits that maybe
a second or two faster on series than it
is on s voice and that's been the theme
I mean generally when I'm using both
these guys I've noticed that Siri is a
little bit faster especially when you're
actually having them closed out so for
example further to actually close s
voice out in the background and try it
again so let's try the same question so
I'll just tap this guy who is the
president of Brazil okay so we got the
answer and you can see this time was
taking a little bit longer that's been
the general thing but go ahead and ask
it to make us a reminder remind me to
walk the dog in 37 minutes so both of
them seem to work correctly I'm gonna
hit cancel and I suppose is pretty quick
they're pretty much open at the same
time suited so that's pretty good let's
ask it something like for movie show
times nearby so movie show times nearby
I found a Weatherby theaters so we got
movie theaters nearby this like I wanted
um however this one was looking for a
movie named nearby our show times nearby
so you could tell you can speak a little
bit more naturally to Siri than you can
to s voice let's try one more thing
let's say when was Martin Luther King
born so when was Martin Luther King born
and you can see Siri is voting not we
static transcription got the answer on
theory and now we got the answer on s4
so means you see how both of them work
they're pretty good obviously if you do
certain things like say I'm drunk on
Siri it'll probably understand what I'm
saying it'll ask you know for me to call
a taxi the CL responds on s voice I'm
drunk so you can see it gives me an
option called taxi nothing happens here
in s voice let's try something else like
asking it how it's doing how are you
doing so both of them give actually I
like the answer over here on s voice
more but both of them worked pretty well
as you can see overall I'd say s voice
is a little bit slower than serious
let's go and ask a math question really
quick and that'd be my last question for
this video I just want to wrap this guy
up so what's 37 times 80 okay so we got
the answer already is 2016 and you can
see Jack s voice didn't really get what
I was saying correctly just said what's
37 s and where you know Surya understood
me perfectly so you know overall you
could say not only faster but it's also
more accurate and also you could talk to
it a little bit more naturally so you
know and then it is better but s voice
isn't all that bad
however you know I did test Android
jelly bean for Poland we search and
that's a lot better actually like in
more than in series so check that video
out to see the comparison between this
but anyway that's it from me in this
