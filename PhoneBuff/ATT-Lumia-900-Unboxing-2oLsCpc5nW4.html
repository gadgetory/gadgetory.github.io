be doing a quick video unboxing of the
Nokia Lumia 900 from AT&amp;amp;T as you can see
you got the box right here see you got
the 4.3 inch AMOLED clear back display
so Windows Phone got that Carl Zeiss
camera front facing camera I'm not
really here to show you the box so it's
good unbox it only thing I've done is
cut this thing so I haven't opened it I
promise go ahead and open this guy up
really quick show you what to expect
inside so you've got the quick start
guide right at the front says uh texting
and driving it can wait oh it's actually
the phone itself all right um so you can
see it's a black nokia lumia 900 and you
have the texting driving you can wait on
the front so go ahead and prop this guy
off so that's the screen cover pretty
cool definitely don't wanna be texting
and driving and on the back you just
have indicators telling you where the
volume is I don't know that's coming up
on camera today the volume is the power
and lock button the camera button where
you how you can put in the sim card up
here so pretty cool that it has this
little instruction thing of course the
headphone jacks right here got the
microUSB right here at the top it's
really not coming through on camera see
if I could get an angle anyway I've got
the headphone jack right here and I was
quoting Top this guy off you see the 8
megapixel camera on the back definitely
a clean looking device you can see the
front the screen looks beautiful
definitely like the design um it's
you're not too heavy a device but it's
definitely not light it's uh the
thickness is you know it's okay I mean
it's not thin by any means I wouldn't
consider it a thin foam but it's
definitely not thick either like the way
these weaker grill looks at the bottom
volume buttons and lock button and the
camera and all one side which is pretty
cool because the left side is completely
clean and like I said you got the
headphone jack here at the top got your
micro USB at the top and the micro-sim
slot right there but that's pretty much
it for the phones going to put the
decide you can see right here you've got
this uh different little nokia i don't
know what this is actually Oh says the
same door key so in order
be able to open up the sim card slot get
up pull this guy out and you could use
this guy to take out the sim door so you
just prop it in like that and there you
go so let's prop this guy out it was
like I'm gonna break it but there you go
alright so you can see I got the sim
card slot out so that's pretty cool it
wasn't expecting that anyway put that
aside let's flip this guy open get your
begin your amazing journey smart start
little flyer got your little instruction
manual or not sure this is a product
safety and information let's see
accessories you've got your micro USB
dongle got your USP the wall charger
this one's cool is pretty it's round in
the white looks really clean obviously
this where you put this guy in see what
else we have in the box think that is it
yeah that's all we have in the box see
says you know to learn more go to
att.com / Orioles why would you do that
