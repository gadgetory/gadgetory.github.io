sent in the use of a galaxy s7 as a
shield please use the common sense your
mother gave you what's up guys David and
Janie here and welcome back to yet
another episode of vs. the show where we
work with professionals to conduct
extreme durability tests last episode we
tested to see whether or not an iPhone
can protect your head from narrow in
this episode we're gonna see if the
galaxy s7 can do the same now if you
watch something for a drop tests these
galaxies tend not to do too well because
of the glass body but who knows I guess
we just have to find out let's see
all right so the professional working
with us today again is Nicole and as she
gets ready
what do things gonna happen I think the
galaxy's plugger to do worse justice cuz
the class I don't think that's my galaxy
guys I know you really love your phone
and it's a great phone don't get me
wrong but it's it's glass versus a metal
tip I just can't I don't have a lot of
my good combination whoa let's see what
happens
oh my goodness I think it went through I
don't know I think it seems pretty solid
I think it went oh yeah I went in not in
Caesar
we lost Caesar right in the ear oh it's
fine it's done save these are I want to
just give a little there you go
it's good
all right so let's take a look at the
slo-mo and see what the hell happened
and how things went badly well I mean
it's because someone's ass our shooter
knows what a batteries aren't are just
aiming for the batteries oh my god oh
she's like look at it look at it go
through oh my gosh yeah so that person
is definitely dead like I just kept
going through right through the year oh
my gosh brings a whole new meaning don't
hear me now almost like half halfway
through his head that's death that is
that my dad if the burning didn't do it
the arrow did let's see that one more
time
Oh a little impact it just went straight
through yeah I had no I had no intention
to stop Adam yeah these are the iPhone I
imagine the metal helps slow it down but
this one just there we go my theory was
right my theory was right all right so
if you take a quick look you can see the
gel is melting because of the fire it's
dripping off the galaxy s7 it's dripping
off Caesars head this looks nasty and
it's definitely not something I expected
no I've I mean we've seen the fires
before another test but there's a point
where it's melting everything on the
face yeah you're not gonna be alive and
your faces be messed up from all the
fire so oh my gosh so galaxies are quite
the deadly force when they're shot by
now look at this this keeps dripping
poor Caesar
we love our Caesar recipe sir the arrow
went way further than that pretty much
right here so this is pretty much of
this much arrow in your head means
certain death in my opinion right oh my
god look at the phone look at the burn
marks look at the the gel melted all
over it this has got to be the nastiest
destruction I've ever seen I mean that's
basically the blood like imagine that
gel is blood that's what basically you
blow it all over the phone oh wow pretty
safe to say that galaxy will not save
you from an arrow let alone save you
from burning event after being shot by
it so I mean if you guys want to get
cremated after you died here's the
galaxy s7 when you get shot by an arrow
or just avoid an arrow simple as that
anyway that is it for this in this
episode I guess we're friggin done but
we have
more episodes coming up so make sure you
subscribe and if you like this video

we'll see you in the next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
