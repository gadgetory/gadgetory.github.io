says we have all been waiting for is
finally here today we got the galaxy s 9
plus where it's going up against the
iPhone 10 and the reigning speed test
champ and the 1 + 5 t now taking a look
at the spec sheets all three of these
phones are packing a punch the iPhone 10
has apples a 11 Bionic chip the 1 + 5 t
has a whopping 8 gigabytes RAM and the
Galaxy S 9 plus is powered by the new
Snapdragon 85 so which one of these
phones will prove to be the fastest and
are we looking at a new champ let's find
out giveaway time we're giving away a
galaxy s 9 plus to a lucky subscriber
learn how to enter to win by clicking on
the first link down below in the
description so you know how it goes
we'll kick things off by starting the
stopwatch is on each phone and then jump
right into the first row of system apps
where the SN Plus immediately falls
behind there in the camera app I'm not
sure if the slower launch is related to
the new variable aperture but luckily
for the s9 it didn't make too much of a
difference with it already catching up
to the 1 plus 5t in photoshop with the
iPhone 10 ahead of the pack already in
premiere so each phone will be
processing the same exact 5 second clip
with the 11 Bionic shape in the iPhone
10 just blowing through the task and
already moving on to the gaming row
while surprisingly the new Snapdragon a
45 in the s9 doesn't outperform the
older Snapdragon 835 in the 1 + 5 t
it'll be interesting to see if the extra
horsepower under the hood of the s9 +
can actually make a difference here in
the gaming row where so far it doesn't
really look like that's the case with
the 1 plus 5t being able to stay neck
and neck with the s9 as each phone works
on fit the fats meanwhile the iPhone 10
is looking to improve on its lead with
it blasting through bullet force and
moving on to Spotify where it's able to
take thee when I believe it had over the
other phones and turn it into a 2 a
bleed as it starts working on ESPN so
just over 3/4 into this first lap the s9
+ has not been able to get the 1 + 5 t
off of its back which considering that
the 5 T is using a previous generation
processor is actually pretty impressive
on the part of the 5 T and shows us
exactly why it's been the fumble style
speeds as champers
long anyways the iPhone 10 finishes the
first half of the time of one minute and
22 seconds while the 5 T and the s9 plus
battled it out for a second place where
they actually tie with the time of 1
minute and 27 seconds the iPhone 10 so
far has been able to keep all the apps
opened in the background but it's 3
gigabytes of RAM fails to keep flip
driving ready allowing both the s9 + and
the 1 + 5 t to make the comeback so at
this point it's pretty much a 2 pony
race between the s9 + and the 5 t where
both won't able to keep all the apps
open and ready to go and the only
difference here is the animation time
with the 5 T finishing first with the
time of 1 minute and 51 seconds and the
s time plus finishing just a second
later the iPhone 10 continues to
struggle having to reload most of the
remaining apps where it eventually
crosses the finish line with the time of
2 minutes and 18 seconds now because
this one is so close and under that
three-second margin of error I'm gonna
have to call it a tie between the s 9 +
and the 1 + 5 t taking a look at the
individual app load up times from the
first lap you can see that the a 11
Bionic is still the king when it comes
to heavy duty tasks while the difference
between these snapdragon 85 on the s 9 +
and the snapdragon 835 on the 1 + 5 t
isn't really all that noticeable when it
comes to launching apps of course that's
not to say that there isn't a difference
in other areas like energy consumption
and graphics so keep that in mind
anyways that is it for me in this video
thank you guys for watching and as
always I'll see you in the very next
episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
