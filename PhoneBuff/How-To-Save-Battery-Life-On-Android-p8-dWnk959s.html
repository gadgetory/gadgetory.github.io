of comm and today I'm be doing a quick
video on how to get better battery life
out of your Android phone so one of the
first things you can do to maximize your
phone's battery life is to figure out
what's using it up in the first place
and to do this you press menu from the
home screen go to settings scroll down
to the bottom where it says about phone
and under here you're going to look for
something along lines of battery or
battery use this case you're just
battery and that we're really looking
for those battery use so I'll tap
battery use and you get a list of what's
using your phone's battery this case is
display in Android live wallpapers using
the most your phone's probably be a
little bit different because I haven't
really used my phone since I took it off
the plug but it'll give you a better
idea as far as what you need to do to
minimize the use of your phone's battery
so you may have noticed that display was
taking up most of my phone's battery and
that's because I have the brightness up
high so one thing you can do to make
your battery life lasts a little bit
longer is reduce the brightness of your
screen and to do that you can go to menu
and settings go over to the display
options this time and go to brightness
so of course mine's all the way up I'm
recording this video but what you want
to do is dim it as low as you can where
you can still see it comfortably but the
dimmer you make it the more battery life
you're going to save because it doesn't
require as much juice to keep the screen
on another way you can save a lot of
battery life is to make sure that your
wireless connections are off when you're
not using them things like Wi-Fi
Bluetooth and GPS so online they're all
off right now but the way you turn them
off and on is you go to settings
wireless networks so for Wi-Fi you can
see it's unchecked you want to make sure
that's uncheck when you're not using it
same wise bluetooth and then GPS is
going to be under location and you can
see says use GPS satellites I've already
unchecked it to see if my better life
and that's why it didn't show up under
that list that I showed you earlier
so while turning off the wireless
connections that you're not using and
reducing your screens brightness seem
like some of the more obvious things you
can do to save battery life we'll go
over some of the not so obvious things
to save battery life starting with
turning off your account sync and by
that I mean you
accounts with your calendar your Gmail
and your contacts turn those guys off
and that'll definitely save you some
juice because the phone want to
communicate back and forth with the
Google server as well as third-party
applications such as new stocks in this
case or Facebook and Twitter of course
you may not want to turn all of them off
but turning someone off especially the
ones that you don't necessarily need to
be constantly updated will save you some
juice another thing you can do to save
battery life is turning off the
vibration on your phone for both
notifications and just system-wide and
the reason why you'd want to do this is
because every time you receive a text
message for example the phone vibrates
which takes up power or if you do a
system-wide every time you're typing on
the keyboard and every letter you type
the phone vibrates that can take up a
lot of battery life over time especially
if you're texting or emailing a lot so
to do this you go to menu go to settings
go over to the sound settings and you
can see right here it says vibrate
feedback for calls notifications I can
uncheck it to turn them off if you just
want to turn off the system-wide vibrate
feature you just go to the bottom it
says vibrate feedback or sometimes
they'll call it haptic feedback and it's
unchecked I hear so every time I'm tap
back it's not going to vibrate or if
when I go my keyboard is not going to
vibrate another thing you could do is
turn off the live wallpapers on your
phone because live wallpapers do take a
battery running in the background and
this switch them out by long-pressing
anywhere in your home screen go to
wallpaper and just select another one
and if you have a Super AMOLED screen
I'd recommend using a darker screen or a
darker wallpaper because Super AMOLED
screens don't require the backlight to
go on when displaying blacks so if this
was a Super AMOLED screen you know these
pixels wouldn't be lit up which in turn
saves battery life another thing you
could try is to delete your widgets
because some of these widgets are
depending on the widget can take up some
battery life like their weather widget
for example this is constantly syncing
with the Internet to get the weather or
if you have a news widget same idea so
just delete these guys and make sure
they're not syncing in the accounts and
sync and it'll save you some juice
another tip you could try is
getting a task killer of some sort to
close out apps when you're not using
them if they consistently run in the
background so in this case this phone
has a built-in
task manager but you can download one
from the market and that you know you
just hit kill all and that way an app
isn't running in the background of
course that's not going to stop apps
that automatically run in the background
from running but it will stop the ones
like you personally ran from staying
open in the background which in turn
could save you some battery life and my
last tip in this video is probably one
of the most basic and asked this to get
in the habit of turning the screen off
when you're done using the phone so as
soon as you're done tap the screen off
so that way not wasting battery life
when you're not even using the phone um
so I've given you a bunch of tips now of
course you don't have to use all of them
at once you could use them you know as
you please just kind of mess around with
them and to figure out you know what
works for you but that's pretty much for
me in this video if you want the full
how-to article go to phonebook com the
