you by lynda.com what's up guys david
here from film buff and for the most
part smartphones do the same thing i
don't care if you have an iphone Windows
Phone Android or even a blackberry if
you have a smartphone
azar that it does most of the same
things that my smartphone does unless
your phone is defective it can make
calls text browse the web download an
app take a picture etc etc etc the fact
of the matter is most of the features
that we need our smartphones to do or
smartphones generally do do so what
about the features that we want our
smart phones to do better yet what about
the features that we think our smart
phones should be able to do well in this
video I'm gonna be giving you my top 10
features that I think every smartphone
regardless of platform should have but
before I do that I want to give a big
shout out to lynda.com for making this
video possible now for those of you who
follow me on Twitter you know that I
just recently built my first app now
it's not something extraordinary it's
just a simple calculator but for a
beginner like me it's something I'm
actually really proud of and I was able
to do it from start to finish in just a
few hours with Linda Collins video
tutorials so if you want to learn how to
do the same or if you want to learn
something else like how to take better
pictures or edit better videos lynda.com
has thousands of video courses for you
to choose from with more and more being
added every week plans start at just 25
bucks a month end for you foam buffs
lynda.com is hooking it up with a free
7-day trial so click on that first link
down below in the description check out
what lynda.com has to offer in hey help
support the channel in the process all
right let's get right into it
so the first picture that I think every
smartphone should have is a fingerprint
scanner now I can already hear some of
you guys saying that fingerprint
scanners are a gimmick but hear me out
for a second a fingerprint scanner when
it's done right lets you secure your
phone without it taking any longer than
having no password at all in fact when
you use a phone like the iPhone 5s
having a fingerprint scanner or a
fingerprint password enabled actually
lets you get into the phone faster than
just swiping it to unlock so you get to
have the same level of security as a
regular password while also making the
process of unlocking your phone more
convenient and add to that the fact that
more and more apps will be supporting
fingerprint scanners for things like
mobile payments and it's a win win win
to front-facing speakers audio is
directional so speakers are faced
towards you instead of away from you
just makes sense if you don't believe me
listen to the audio that comes out of a
phone like the HTC One and I can pretty
much guarantee you that you'll wonder
why every smartphone doesn't have them
seriously these front-facing speakers
sounds so much better than anything else
out there so much so that I've got far
as saying that I'll take one front
facing speaker over two rear speakers
let's say goodbye to phone cupping for
good three 4k video I've noticed that
whenever I do a video talking about a
phone that could record in 4k there
always seems to be somebody in the
comments saying that 4k video recording
is useless because most of us don't have
4k displays right now but well that may
be true the reality is when we record a
video on our phones we're typically
trying to capture memories not only for
playing back right away but for playing
back in two three or four years down the
line and by that time 4k may be the new
1080p so it makes sense to have your
memories captured in 4k now so you can
view them in 4k later for emergency
alerts so if you've watched a couple of
the videos I've done on the galaxy s5
you've probably heard about these send
help message option and basically what
it is is let's say you're walking down
the street and all of a sudden you get
mugged or you're being followed by some
creepy guys or you get in a car accident
if you triple tap the power button the
phone will automatically send a photo
from your front and rear cameras a short
sound recording and maybe most
importantly your precise location to the
people on your emergency contact list so
that way they can
an idea of where you are and what's
happening to you in a split second now
this feature may not be one that most
was used and hopefully we never have to
but and the situation is where we do it
can literally be a lifesaver the fifth
feature that I think every smartphone
should have is touchless controls or
more specifically touchless voice
assistance on a phone like the Moto X
you're able to give it a simple wake of
command and access all the great things
that Google now can do without ever
having to physically touch the phone and
I'm telling you once you get used to
having this feature for a while it's
hard to go back to any other phone that
doesn't have it which to me is a clear
sign that every smartphone should six
split-screen multitasking when I use my
computer I often use more than one app
at the same time and with smart phones
getting bigger and bigger screens it
really makes sense that I should be able
to do the same thing on my smart phone
for example when I use a calculator and
a web browser to try to figure out how
many calories I just consumed in my
massive meal it's so much easier to do
when I can see and use both apps at the
same time instead of having to switch
back and forth between the two seven
water and dust resistance sure you may
be careful with your phone and avoid
situations where you can get damaged due
to the elements but having water and
dust resistance built right into the
phone can potentially save it when
somebody else does something like push
you into a pool or spill their drink all
over it but those are the obvious
benefits and for me the ones that I find
more useful on a day to day basis are
being able to pick up a phone call while
you're washing the dishes or using your
phone while you're eating something
messy and being able to wash it off
later I know we've all kind of been
conditioned to not use our phones in
these type of situations but with a
water and dust resistant phone we don't
really have to worry about it anymore
which to me adds greatly to the overall
user experience eight power saving modes
a few months back I stayed in a hotel in
LA for my cousin's birthday party and I
made the classic mistake of forgetting
my charger at home so I had like 20%
battery to last me not only throughout
the night but also the next day until I
got home well luckily I had a phone that
had a power saving mode that effectively
turned the smartphone into a dumb phone
but it made it last throughout the night
easily and when I got home I still had
about 10%
left now forgetting my charger are going
desperately low on battery life isn't
something that I like to do all the time
but in that situation the power saving
mode was really really useful and I
couldn't help but to think to myself
that every smartphone should have a
future like it 9 fast charging hope I'm
not done talking about battery life just
yet because no matter what kind of great
features a smartphone has if its battery
is dead
you can't really use any of them right
so the number one priority should be
battery life and with fast charging on a
phone like the Alpo fine 7 if you forget
to plug in your phone one night and you
wake up the next day with a dead battery
you can charge it from 0 to 75% in about
30 minutes while you get ready for
school or work it's an awesome awesome
feature to have in I love it if all my
phones had it ok so we're finally here
the 10th feature that I think every
smartphone should have is a private or a
guest mode the fact is that our smart
phones hold a lot of information about
our lives it's almost a virtual
reflection of ourselves and we may not
want others who borrow our phones to be
able to access everything on them so a
private or a guest mode that hides the
apps and files that you don't want other
people to see it's something that every
smartphone should have but that about
does it for my list those are the top 10
features that I think every smartphone
should have all the features I listed in
this video make the user experience
better they don't really get in our way
in the most important part is they work
seamlessly but what are your top 10
features let me know down in the
comments but other than that that is
pretty much it for me in this video if
you liked it please give it a thumbs up
to surely love and subscribe to the
channel for more mobile technology
videos from me just like this thank you
for watching in I'll catch you guys in
the very next episode
