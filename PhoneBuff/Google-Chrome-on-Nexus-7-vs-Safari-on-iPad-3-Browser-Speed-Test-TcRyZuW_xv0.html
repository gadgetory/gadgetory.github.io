Pumbaa calm and in this video we're
doing a speed comparison test between
the google chrome browser found on the
Nexus 7 and the Safari browser found on
the third-generation iPad so I did clear
out the browsing history on both devices
and the both connected to the same Wi-Fi
network actually did a fresh fruit on
both devices as well so it's gonna be
nice and fair I'm going to open up both
browsers you can see that I am running
no other applications in the background
so again it could be as fair as possible
now something to note i am leaving on
the pre-loading feature for the google
chrome browser on so you can see preload
web pages is always on basically what
that does is it loads up the website as
I'm like typing it in and then when i
hit go is gonna be like halfway loaded
almost or maybe even fully loaded but
the reason why I'm leaving it on in this
case because in my other video comparing
the two devices you know I left it off
and a lot of you guys were complaining
about you know saying thats that's an
advantage of google chrome has by taking
it away it's unfair I feel like it was
unfair by leaving it on but nonetheless
you know we're going to do this video
anyway to see what the difference is now
to make it a little bit fair though I'm
gonna only type in about half the
domains here first and then on the iPad
and then for the other half on the type
of first on the ipad and then on the
nexus 7 so that way it isn't too much of
a big advantage so well first website
we'll go ahead and do foam ball calm so
enter it on the next sem first all right
one two three
and as you can see the next seven is
done loading and the ipad is still
loading it and there you go the ipad is
done let's go ahead and tap on an
article really quick so that way we
could you know test another web page now
this one you know the pre-loading isn't
going to be an advantage for the next
seven because it doesn't know which
article i'm going to actually tap on so
we're going to tap on the apple removes
youtube app from iOS 6 so one two three
see the content first on the iPad
followed by the Nexus 7 and both of them
look to be done but you know if I have
to give the witness one it's going to be
the ipad be hesitant show the content
first let's go ahead and tap on one more
article and i will do the google voice
search coming to the iphone and ipad
soon so one two three and again load it
up a little bit faster on the iPad you
can see like the YouTube picture and
everything was populated first compared
to the Nexus 7 so far the 2i page is
loaded faster on the iPad the actual
homepage bloated faster in the next
seven and that's mainly thanks to the
pre-loading feature let's go ahead and
go to another website will go to
engadget one two three go so I saw the
concept little faster on here but now we
got the whole web page and it looks like
it's fully loaded just about and the
ipad still going and that now it's about
done so let's go ahead and do a scroll
test really quick so that way you know
you can see how will look when you
actually scroll down so i'm going to
scroll down you know pretty fast on both
devices and you see looks pretty good
actually right now so i'll scroll up
really fast on the ipad and i'll scroll
up really fast on the Nexus 7 and so far
so good usually you know from my past
experience the nexus 7 does show a
little bit of white screen while you're
scrolling but in this case it's actually
not so that's pretty good we'll go ahead
and tap on the article will tap on this
guy right over here so find a little
read more icon two one two three
content showed up first on the next
seven and that was a really close one I
saw the content first on here some of
the advertisements and stuff populated
first on here so you this could be the
judge of that one I'm not gonna call it
because I didn't really get a good look
at it I have to rewatch it on video so
let's go ahead and go to another website
so now since I've done two websites
pre-loading on here let's go ahead and
type it first on the iPad and then
followed by the nexus 7 so we'll do New
York Times all right one two three go
again most of the content populated
first on the Nexus 7 so we have to give
the winton nexus 7 there let's go ahead
and tap on an article again so we'll do
this one right over here 1 2 3 and
contents populating first on here it's
done now this guy's done so pretty much
the theme you know even not right there
because you know just counting one two
three it was enough of an advantage for
the pre-loading to actually make a
difference in load up the web page
faster so pretty you know it's pretty
big advantage to have that p loading and
it's it's a nice feature on say i do
like it we'll go ahead and type in
another website so will do will do LA
times but this time i try to hit go
right away so we'll go ahead and type it
in on the ipad first
alright so I hate go right away got the
content first here followed over here
and it's still loading as you guys can
see on both got the advertisers
populated and that that one looked like
a finished just about the same time for
the most part you know I saw the nexus 7
having a head start I know that the last
second is caught up so again I'm not too
sure but i think the win went to the
next seven there i will go ahead and tap
on an article will tap on this HBO
netflix one two one two three content
first here and this one's done and this
one's finishing up and there you go it's
done so for the most part you know seems
like with the pre-loading feature
enabled loading of websites is faster
here even if i hit him at the same time
so it's pretty impressive when i had the
pre-loading feature off it was actually
you know the opposite that the ipad with
the safari browser was winning just what
every time but now let's go ahead and do
some benchmarks because those are real
real world tests to see how the
benchmarks look we'll go to browser mark
on both devices alright so go ahead and
run the benchmark on both devices at the
same time and then I'll just kind of
skip through the whole process so you
guys can see the scores at the end
alright so the browsing benchmark is
done and you can see the nexus 7 scored
a 130 2408 thanks to google chrome's
optimizations and the iPads browser the
Safari browser scored a 90 9898 so
definitely a higher score for the Nexus
7 and honestly I'm not too surprised
because I know the google chrome browser
is really optimized i even you know use
it I've compared the Google home browser
on iOS to the Safari Browser on iOS and
the google chrome browser actually beat
it out so we'll go ahead and do another
benchmark well let's do the html5
benchmark
alright so I'm just going to the html5
test website and it'll just give us a
score so 369 for browser compatibility
and 324 for browser competitor
compatibility on the Safari brothers so
again from the benchmarks you know the
Nexus browser the google chrome browser
scored better and from some of the real
world tests as long as we had that
preloaded feature enabled it did score i
did a you know load those home pages
faster the actual articles and web page
is loaded faster on the Safari browser
but as far as the browser's go you don't
have to say the better browser is the
google chrome browser because i've not
only tested it you know between these
two but also on iOS itself between
safari and google chrome and again i
said google chrome actually
out-performed it but you know hardware
wise you can tell the renderings a
little bit faster on the new ipad so you
know you have to give a new ipad the
edge there it seems a little bit more
powerful you know this guy's a quad-core
cpu but anyway that's pretty much it
from in this video hopefully you know
this you know answers the questions you
guys had it you know as far as what
difference does preloading make if you
turn it off and on but anyway found this
