of style speed test between the
Snapdragon and the Exynos version of the
galaxy s 10 and you know without giving
anything away there was a difference in
that test I'll be linking it down below
in case you missed it but speed is only
one factor to consider in a smartphone
another factor arguably the more
important factor for a lot of people is
battery life I've seen some reports
where the Exynos version looks like it
has the advantage and then some other
reports where it's the opposite with the
Snapdragon version having the advantage
so today we're just gonna make it
official with the phone buff style
battery test taking a look at the spec
sheet the global version of the s10 is
using Samsung's own eight nanometer
Exynos 98 20 while the US and Canadian
version of the S 10 is using Qualcomm
z-- 7 nanometers Snapdragon 855
everything else on these two phones is
pretty much the same but the question of
course is whether or not battery life is
the same so let's find out
after the test check out the official
fumble of style rankings on our website
at the link below which we created with
the sponsor of today's video in Wix so
you can do a lot of different things on
your smartphone nowadays and thanks to
Wix is artificial design intelligence
you can add building a professional
website to that list after answering
just a few questions and uploading some
of your photos wix's ad I can have your
new website up and running in a matter
of minutes
so tap into the power of your smartphone
and AI and build your own website for
free at the first link down below
all right so we'll kick things off with
the phone test where we're making a
one-hour call on each phone we're
testing both bones and the same exact
location with the same exact SIM card
and an equal range of the mini cell
tower that we have installed in the lab
our robot is covering the proximity
sensor here for the majority of the
tests since in the real world when
you're on a phone call you keep your
phone pressed up to your ear where the
screen remains off most of the time
after one hour both phones see their
battery drop by an equal seven percent
which isn't the worst results but more
importantly so far there isn't a
difference between the two different
variants of Samsung's flagship
smartphone but it'll be interesting to
see if this holds up here in the
messaging test where we're simulating a
real life text messaging conversation by
typing in a string of letters and
suggestions with our automated chat bot
coming back with the same set of
responses from the other end of course
we have the displays on each phone and
calibrated to 200 nits to make sure that
what we're testing here is the
difference between the chipsets and
that's some random discrepancy in the
display brightness after one long hour
of texting back and forth the Snapdragon
variant of the s10 drops by 9% compared
to the 10% drop on the Exynos variant
definitely not enough of a difference at
this point to draw any conclusions so
we'll move on to the email test to see
if the trend continues what we're doing
here is opening up the same set of
emails on each phone and then actually
scrolling through each one of these
emails to simulate
you check email in the real world we
make sure to freshly install the email
app on every phone that we test so that
way each phone is loading up the emails
for the very first time after one hour
both phones drop by an equal 10% in
battery with the snapdragon variants
till 1 percentage point ahead at 74%
with the X and O's variants right there
behind it at 73 so so far the two phones
look like they're performing about the
same which is exactly the way that it
should be as nobody should have to pay
around the same amount of money for an
inferior version of the same phone we'll
continue the test by heading into the
browser where we have a customized
script that randomly cycles through the
same set of websites to help keep things
more realistic we also have a robot
scrolling through these websites at
fixed intervals to better simulate how
you actually browse the web in real life
after the one hour web browsing session
it's the same story both phones drop by
an equal 12 percent with the snapdragon
variants battery being at 62% while the
X and O's variants is at 61 next test up
is Instagram where we're on the home
feed and we have a robot scrolling
through the feed just like you would in
real life now this is important since
not only are we loading out fresh
content by scrolling on the screen but
we're also interacting with the screen
which means that the phone has to
process those swipes which may have an
effect on battery life after one hour of
scrolling the screen for dopamine we
finally see some sort of difference
between the two albeit a really small
one with the snapdragon variant dropping
by 11% to 51 and the Exynos variant
dropping by 12% to 49
moving on we're heading into the standby
test a test that makes conducting these
battery tests take an incredible amount
of time but something that I think is
really important since in the real world
in the course of a 24 hour day your
phone is gonna be on standby most of the
time whether in your pockets or just
sitting there on your desk
sixteen hours of standby with the sim
card still installed we see our first
major difference between the two
variants of the s10 with the Snapdragon
version dropping by only eight percent
243 whereas the external experience did
significantly worse dropping by a
whopping 17 percent all the way down to
32 indicating that for whatever reason
the Exynos parent doesn't do as well and
standby even in a controlled environment
like our test lab but we'll see if the
trend continues as we move back to these
screen on tests with us heading into
YouTube first where we'll be playing the
same set of videos of course we've
calibrated the speakers on each phone to
the same decibel level to make sure that
things remain as controlled as possible
and after one hour of YouTube binge
watching both bones drop by an equal
amount once again allowing the
snapdragon variant of the Galaxy S ten
to hold on to its lead with its battery
now at 28% 12 percentage points ahead of
the Exynos variants which sees its
battery drop down to 16% now heading
into the gaming test here will be
interesting because unlike most of the
other screen on tests this one more
heavily taxes the processors on each
phone so we'll likely see at least some
sort of difference maybe even a
potential come back by the Exynos
variants but unfortunately that didn't
happen with the Exynos variant of the
s10 losing all 16% of its battery just
one minute shy of completing the one
hour test while the Snapdragon variant
was able to complete the full hour and
dropped by only 15% while doing so with
13% of its batteries still remaining
which considering that the next test up
here is maps it could mean that while
the Exynos variant would leave you
stranded the Snapdragon variant would
still have enough juice to potentially
take you home with it getting through
entire one-hour simulated navigation
test with two percent batteries still
left to go we'll see how long that 2%
lasts here in Spotify where after just
two minutes into the test the Snapdragon
variant of the s10 finally calls it
quits so with both phones out of juice
let's take a look at the results the
Exynos variant of the s10 lasted 22
hours and 59 minutes when you count the
16 hours stand by while the Snapdragon
variant lasted over an hour longer at 24
hours and 2 minutes making the winner
and the longer-lasting version of the
Galaxy S 10 Qualcomm Snapdragon 855
variants for the updated battery test
rankings be sure to check out our
website at the link below which we
created easily with our sponsor wix's
drag and drop editor anyways that is it
for me in this video thank you guys for
watching and as always I'll see you in
