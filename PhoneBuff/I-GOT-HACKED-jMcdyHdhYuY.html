bomble com got hacked I don't know who
did it I don't know why they did it all
I know is that this site was virtually
unusable on the front end and almost
inaccessible on the back end which as
you could probably imagine was an
extremely frustrating experience
especially when you consider there's
been over three years worth of work put
into it but what can you do right what
was done was done so i started working
with my host trying to get this site
back up and running and a few days into
it trying to work with my host i
realized that they were going to be able
to do anything to help me out and I knew
that on my own on my end I wasn't gonna
be able to do anything leaving me with
only one option of moving over to a new
server hopefully finding a recent backup
to restore and then kind of moving on
from there acting as if the whole thing
had never happened and initially that
was my plan and so I noticed something
interesting while the site was down and
that was none of you guys we're reaching
out to me asking me why you couldn't
access the site and you know sometimes
no feedback is all the feedback that you
need obviously you guys were telling me
by not telling me anything at all that
you weren't using the site I mean there
was a good amount of traffic coming in
through search and referrals but it
wasn't you guys and honestly I could see
why I mean the site hadn't been as
active as it once was and a lot of the
new content that was being posted was
just a rehash of what you guys have seen
here on youtube so it got me to thinking
why not use this situation this crappy
thing that happened and use it as an
opportunity to make lemonade out of
lemons and make something better out of
the site than what it was before so I
decided not to restore the old site and
to build a completely new one built
completely from the ground up on a
faster and more secure server and this
time around have the site be designed
with you
guys the community right here on YouTube
one hundred percent in mind and today I
actually have two new features on the
site that I am very excited to announce
them think you guys will really like the
first one is the all new phone buff deal
store so you've probably seen a few deal
sites around the web that range from
selling jewelry to baby diapers but what
makes phone book deals different is it's
exclusive to text so you can find deals
on Bluetooth speakers and phone cases to
drones and selfie sticks if you're into
that kind of thing there will constantly
be new deals added every week so it's
not a storm that you want to visit just
once you want to kind of come back every
week and see what's new either by going
to form of calm and clicking on the
deals tab or going directly to deals
bomble com and as a part of the grand
opening for one week only you can get an
additional ten percent off of anything
storewide using the coupon code phone
buff thames so essentially you're
getting a deal on top of a deal
definitely something we're checking out
in addition to these one week ten
percent discount we're also given away a
one plus one it's stupid simple to enter
the giveaway all you have to do is go to
the giveaway page which i'll be linking
for you down below enter in your email
address and that is it you are entered
to win can't really get much easier to
that so take advantage of that
opportunity while it lasts now the
second thing I want to announce with the
all new form of comm is the forum
section here our foam buff we have a
community of over 400,000 people that's
a lot of people with a lot of different
questions opinions and concerns about
technology and we don't really have an
optimal way of voicing them within our
community I mean social media is great
but the conversations aren't as visible
as they could be the comments here on
YouTube are awesome but they could be
hard to track and the conversations seem
to die out usually after a few days so I
feel like with the forums the
conversations will not only have a high
visibility to everybody in the community
they can also be kept going on for a
longer period of time so not just a few
days but maybe weeks months and who
knows maybe years at a time I've seen
cray
your thing so I'm really excited about
it I encourage all of you to head over
to the site register for the forums and
post a new topic on anything you want to
talk about there's a bunch of categories
for you to choose from and if you don't
know where to start go to the
introductions forum and tell us who you
are where you're from what phone you
have why like it etc so we can get to
know you a little bit better in the
community but other than that that is
pretty much it for me in this video like
I said I am super excited about the new
site I hope you guys are too because it
was built with you guys mind but other
nuts then you guys for watching and I
will see you in the very next video or
hopefully over in the forums alright
later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
