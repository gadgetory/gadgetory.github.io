calm and today I'll be doing a video on
how to delete the swipe personal
dictionary a lot of people have this
issue especially the older versions of
swipe where you type something in on
accident like a mistake and it gets
stored into your personal dictionary and
when you're trying to type in the word
again the correct word it enters the
mistake instead of the one that you want
so you become blue afresh reading I'll
go ahead and demonstrate I'm a typing
phone or swiped phone so you can see
instead of phone it typed in 8o h o NR o
my already I put that in there and
purpose just to be able to demonstrate
this and I'm once I've been a internet
now so you see it typed in imer brt
instead of internet so you can imagine
how that could get annoying so there's
two ways to delete it right from the
swipe app you can press the little swipe
key right here at the bottom left and
that's the way to do it individually so
I could press this press it again it
says do you want to remove it from your
dictionary and I hit OK and it's gone so
now I could type in Internet and there
you go but you know over the course of a
few weeks there could be hundreds of
mistakes in there so what you want to do
is delete it the whole dictionary and
I'll show you how to do it with this you
go ahead and press and hold this with
the newest version swipe you can
actually go right into the settings and
hit reset dictionary or go to a personal
dictionary and you know do it one by one
but this is a new version a lot of
people don't have the new version so the
way you do it with older versions is go
to your home screen hit menu settings go
to applications and then manage
applications and you're going to find
swipe from this list so click on swipe
and let it load up so it's computing
right now and you're going to hit the
clear data so I'll zoom in for you guys
so you can see it set clear data so this
are you sure
hit okay and it'll go ahead and clear
that out and now when I go back to my
notes I'll type in phone again oops
loading another keyboard yeah so when
you clear the data it does clear
everything even your settings like if
you wanted to vibrate when you hit it so
that's the only downside to this but
sometimes got to do what you got to do
it so anyway I'm gonna go ahead and type
in phone and you can see now I got it
right
without the mistake even being in there
so that's if you want to do it you know
Kumasi delete otherwise you could do it
one by one or I recommend this updating
your swipe so I'll be able to do it
right there from the settings in you
don't have to go through resetting up
your your customizations alright that's
it for me if you want to read the full
article go to phonebook calm and you
