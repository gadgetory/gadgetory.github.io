has been the fumble style speed test
champ for a long time now and i'm not
just talking about the iPhone 7 plus
goes back all the way to the end of 2015
with the iPhone 6s but that title of
bumble style.css champ is on the line
today
with the iPhone going up against easily
the number one contender in the 1 plus 5
which not only looks like the iPhone 7
plus but it might just be as fast with 8
gigabytes ram the snapdragon 835 128
gigabytes of ufs 2.1 storage along with
one plus is two-lane wrong so I'm really
excited about today's free test but
before we get into it I want to thank
LastPass for sponsoring today's video

password manager used by millions of
people to protect their identity and to
preserve their sanity gone are the days
where you have to remember like 30
different passwords for all your
different accounts because with LastPass
you only have to remember one master
password with is securely storing all
your other usernames and passwords for
you and even automatically filling them
in in the browser and inside of
compatible apps LastPass things across
all of your devices relieving the
trouble of looking for passwords and
relieving the anxiety around getting
locked out of your account you don't
have to write remember or reset your
passwords you keep track of it all for
you allowing you to stay sane and put
your passwords on autopilot so click on
that link down below in the description
to get last task for free and simplify
your digital life all right let's get to
the speed set so we'll kick things off
like we always do by starting the
stopwatch is on each phone and then jump
right into the first row of system apps
where right off the bat the 1 plus 5
takes the lead with it's quicker
animations now we've seen plenty of
Android phones get the leg up on the
iPhone at the beginning of the test as
Iowa tends animations are almost
painfully slow compared to most Android
phones so the real question is will the
oneplus 5 be able to maintain its lead
especially as we start getting into the
more heavy duty apps so Alyssa the
iPhone has begun chipping away at the
oneplus as lead with it loading both
Photoshop mix and lapse it here at a
faster rate so it'll be interesting to
see if we can make a comeback here in
subway surfer
but no the one pulse finishes first
already moving on to flip diving but
that Christians at the oneplus hat from
its early lead is gone with the iPhone
right there behind it
the oneplus five finishes blip driving
just a split second before the iPhone 7
plus with both phones now working on fit
the fat and unlike in subway surfers and
in flip diving the oneplus actually
loads this game at a faster rate
improving on its lead going into bullet
force so we'll see if the oneplus five
can add on to its lead here in bullet
force but no the iPhone 7 plus makes to
comeback taking the lead for the first
time here in the speed test showing us
exactly why it's been the fall of style
speed test champ for so long now but
this thing is far from over with 1.5
just blazing through Spotify ESPN and
now here in Netflix looking to make a
comeback of its own the iPhone 7 plus
finishes the first time just one second
before the one plus for the time of 1
minute and 26 seconds but the oneplus
takes the lead right back here in the
second lap with it passing the 7 plus as
both phones work their way back up to
the top and again those slower
animations on the iPhone 7 plus are just
killing it here in the second lap as
even though both bones have all the apps
open and ready to go in the background
the oneplus is just running away with it
completing the test with a total time of
1 minute and 51 seconds with the iPhone
7 plus crossing the finish line a whole
7 seconds later with a time of 1 minute
and 58 seconds making the winner and new
bump of style free test champ the 1 plus
5
here are the individual app load up tops
from the first lap where you can see
exactly where each of these phones
offers better performance anyways that
is it for me in this video thank you
guys for watching and as always I'll see
you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
