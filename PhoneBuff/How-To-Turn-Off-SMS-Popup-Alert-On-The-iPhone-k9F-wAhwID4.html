hope calm and this video will show you
how to get rid of the pop-up that comes
up on your iPhone when you get a text
message so go ahead and send myself a
message really quick and show you what I
mean
alright so Isaac see I got a title just
saying hi the only way I can get out the
screen is by actually tapping close or
replies so obviously this could get a
little bit annoying over time so I want
to show you how to change it so what
you're going to do is go to your
settings and then from settings go down
to notifications on a notification
scroll down to where it says messages
and tap on it and you have the option to
either turn it off by going to under
alert style and hitting none but with
iOS 5 you actually also have the option
of turning on banners instead so this is
actually something I prefer because it
doesn't necessarily get in the way like
pop-ups do but also you know it lets me
know that I got a message and I'll go
away automatically in time so I'll go
ahead and demonstrate how this works in
a second let me send myself another
message and I'll go ahead and close out
of here alright so there you go you can
see I got a message up here at the top
shows me with the messages I can just
tap on this guy to open it or I can just
ignore it and you know within a few
seconds it actually goes away but that's
pretty much it for me in this video
