this video will show you how to figure
out your system information on your
Android phone so for example let's say
you wanted to know what version of
Android you ran or how much storage you
have left or what's using up your
battery you could do so by pressing menu
from your homescreen going over to your
settings and then scroll down to the
very bottom where it says about phone
tap on about phone and you can see your
Android version right here so it's 2.3.6
just in case you're wondering what
you're on you can also check your
baseband version and your kernel version
you can see your batteries you should
see what exactly is using up your
phone's battery life you tap back and go
to status you can see your battery
percentage right here you can also see
your IMEI and things of that nature go
in and go back out of here and you could
also look at your storage so under
storage it'll tell you your total space
that you have on your phone and also
your available space so my phone has ten
point seven sixteen bytes left and
that's basically your basic information
that comes with your Android phone if
you want more detailed information as to
what exactly your system information is
you download an app called Android
system info from Google Google Play
Store and you can see everybody
downloaded and installed it it's a free
app and this doesn't give you a lot more
detailed information so I opened up the
app on the homescreen dashboard you're
just given that same basic information
that you're able to get through your
settings but if you want more detailed
information tap on the system tab and
from here you could go to build info you
see it's 2.3.6 you'll also see the other
stats such as the name of the OS which
is Gingerbread you see your phone's
model number which is by Samsung not by
your carrier so this is called the
Galaxy Note but Samsung smaller number
is SGH I 717 so if you want certain
information like that you could get it
from this app so let's show you a few
more examples like your battery you can
see it's discharging you have 27% even
you can see your voltage tap on memory
and you can see how much memory your
phone has how much free RAM you have
and things of that nature I'll go ahead
and go to CPU and this was pretty cool
you could actually even see your maximum
clock speed so this is 1512 megahertz
and the minimum clock speed is 192 so
the phone will range between these
depending on you know how you're using
your phone so you can see my phone is
being used 13.5 9% of the time I just
maximum speed of 512 mega Hertz but 56.7
2 percent of the time it's at running at
384 megahertz so just gives you a better
ideas for us how the phone actually
works or as a processor goes same thing
with the camera I mean you can see your
maximum JPEG image size which is on here
it is uh well where am I looking at
right here 2004 and 48 by 3264 you can
see the different picture sizes you can
take based off the camera settings and
you could also look at your screen
settings and you can see the resolution
so this one's 800 by 1280 and I'll even
give you your PPI or pixels per inch so
this phone has 285 so just gives you a
lot of detailed information that you
know you would never get not only from
the phone settings but even if you
visited you know for example the Galaxy
Notes manufacturer website or if you
went to 18 tees website to look up the
stats on this phone you might not find
the detailed information that you're
finding within this app so it's
definitely a cool way to look at the
details of your phone and I don't know
if this is something you're going to
need on your phone all the time you
could just install it under stall once
you get the information you want but
that's pretty much it for a listen for
me in this video
um just a quick walk through you also
have your tasks right here so you can
see what's running on your phone and how
much memory it's taking you could look
at the apps on your phone and see you
know just your basic basic memory how
much they take and what version number
they are on things of that nature you
could tap on you can uninstall from here
you can manage it and launch it things
like that you can also go to your log so
this is more for developers and you can
actually see every single code that goes
on when you're actually using your phone
so yeah you could actually read what's
going on behind the scenes and uh you
know you won't really
in any of this I don't unless you're a
developer but it's still kind of cool to
see you know how much detailed
information you get from this one little
application alright that's it for me in
