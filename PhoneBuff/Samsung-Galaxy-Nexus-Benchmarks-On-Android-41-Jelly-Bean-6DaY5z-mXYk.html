calm and in this gonna be doing a
benchmarking of the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
this is actually the hspa+ unlocked
version main reason I'm doing this is
one I haven't benchmark the Galaxy Nexus
yet on the channel and to this guy's
running Android 4.1 so I want to see how
that might change the results we're
getting so i'll show you the I'm
throwing IM running android 4.1 i'll go
ahead and back out of here and i will go
ahead and serve our first benchmark I'll
do quadrant so load this guy up really
quick and just hit run full benchmark
let's go ahead and skip through the
process and let you guys see the results
alright so the benchmark is done we'll
go ahead and hit yes to see our results
so you can see that your device which is
the Galaxy Nexus says scored 20 to 75
I'm mixie Galaxy Nexus actually up here
so I just squirt a little bit lower than
the average score obviously Gordon's
gonna fluctuate but it's worth noting
that i did actually do a fresh boot up
before I ran this says so it is you know
didn't have anything really running in
the background so anyway we'll go ahead
and go to the next benchmark and that
will be in 22 so we'll go ahead and do
the same thing i'm well just kind of
fast forward through the whole process
so you guys can see you know the result
is what you're looking for so start test
and pass forward
you
alright so the test is done and you can
see scored a 5084 let's go ahead and go
to the next test which is going to be
the Nano mark so then I mark to put the
sky and landscape and this guy's mainly
testing the GPU on the device will go
ahead and let it run
alright so there you go we got 28.8
frames per second on nano mark we'll go
ahead and back out of here and we'll do
the last match mark actually
second-to-last benchmark and that is
linpack so i'll go ahead and load this
guy up and i'll just run like I don't
know maybe I'll do it three times in you
know get an average results so let's run
run multithread and XC it scored a 70 of
em flop so go again 71 and again 70 so
about 71 70 is the average go ahead and
back out of here and the last test will
run it will be the browser mark
benchmarks Olga and open up the stock
browser and go to browser mark I saw got
the browser mark benchmark up and I'll
go ahead and hit run and again I'll just
skip to the results
alright so the browser market benchmark
is done and scored a really impressive
120 3751 so that pretty much concludes
my benchmarking of the galaxy nexus with
android 4.1 jelly bean hopefully this
gives you a better idea stores the
performance you'll get um I didn't
benchmark the Galaxy Nexus before i
flashed 4.1 so if any of you guys have
4.0 4 4.02 whatever beginners can do
some of these up benchmarks and let me
know with the scores are in the comments
I'd appreciate but anyway sit for me
