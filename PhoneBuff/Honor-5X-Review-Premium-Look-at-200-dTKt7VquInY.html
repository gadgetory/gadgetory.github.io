their own right you've got different
processors different screens and
different cameras all of them look
premium in their own way but only one of
these phones comes at a price so low
that you can buy three of them for the
price of any one of the others
what's up guys David here and this is
the honor 5x its honors first major
entry into the US market and they're
going all-out for that budget segment
with the 5x featuring a premium look a
top-notch fingerprint scanner a big 5.5
inch display a 13 megapixel camera and a
3000 milliamp battery all at a price
point of just 200 bucks now I know
you're thinking cuz I was thinking it
back when honor invited us to the 5x s
launch party and that is what's the
catch where are they making up for the
cost so for the past couple of weeks
I've been testing this thing looking
forward to me the trade-offs and I found
them I hope you weren't expecting
differently at $200 but it's actually
not that bad the 13 megapixel camera
does great when outdoors and it's more
than enough for things like Instagram
and snapchat but it doesn't suffer a bit
in low-light the speaker is a little
tinny and the performance up from the
Snapdragon 615 isn't quite as snappy as
I was hoping you to be there's also no
end of seeing no quick charging and
phone only comes with android 5.1 out of
the box
but honor says is going to be getting
updated marshmallows sometime in the
future now those are the main trade-offs
for this fall but again we're talking
about a $200 phone and really if the
trade-offs that honor didn't make that
really make the phone shine you've got
this brushed aluminum back complete with
chamfered edges that really give the
phone a high-end feel that you just
don't get on any other phone in this
price range and you also have a
fingerprint scanner right where your
finger naturally rests now having a
fingerprint scanner in it of itself is
an achievement for a $200 phone but it's
actually a good fingerprint scanner with
great accuracy and speed the fingerprint
scanner can even be customized to do
things like launching straight into
different apps with different fingers
and also used to swipe down the
notification bar it's pretty legit and I
would totally trade this fingerprint
scanner for the one on my note 5 the 5.5
inch display on the 5x is a 1080p IPS
panel that gives you surprisingly good
sharpness and colors it's
only nucky best display out there but
it's probably the best display that you
can get at the $200 price point the 3000
milliamp battery combined with honors
Mui optimizations will easily last you a
full day and it gets charged via a micro
USB port which on a budget phone is
actually a good thing since you'll have
to go out and buy all-new USB type-c
accessories the 5x comes with 16
gigabytes of internal storage which
luckily is expandable via microSD you
also get dual SIM slots and the phone
comes factory unlocked so you can just
pop in any SIM card and be good to go
there are three color options available
in gold silver and grey and the phone is
being sold exclusively online so I'll be
dropping a link for you down below in
the description and I guess the last
thing worth noting is the emui
interface which to me feels a lot like
iOS since it doesn't have a launcher
like you normally do on Android and
instead it just has home screens I'm
also not the biggest fan of the color
scheme and the icons but since this is
Android you can just slap a new launcher
like Google now or Nova on the phone and
just forget about it but overall the
honor 5x is a budget phone that makes
some pretty good trade-offs and has the
important stuff like build quality
screen quality battery life camera and
the fingerprint scanner done really well
and it ditches some of the less
important things like NFC and quick
charging to help keep the cost low
anyways that is it for me in this video
big things to honor for inviting us out
to Vegas and for sponsoring our CES trip
thank you guys for watching in as always
I'll see you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
