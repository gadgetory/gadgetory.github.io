and in this video I'm gonna show you how
to get your own custom ringtone from
your computer over to your windows phone
and also how to set that ringtone as
your phone this phone ringer on the
phone itself so before I get to that
though I want to go over some of the
requirements that Microsoft has set in
order to be able to do this you need the
file to be an mp3 or WMA format it needs
to be less than 40 seconds long so you
can't use a long song you'll have to
either edit it and make it under 40
seconds or download a clip from one of
those online ringtone sites that does it
for free third the following is you left
from one megabyte and given the fact
that you're gonna be under 40 seconds
more than likely you'll hit this
requirement you know as a result and the
fourth thing is the file cannot be
protected with digital rights management
once you say all these requirements you
can go on to the next step and that's to
open up your Zune player on your Windows
computer or your iTunes player on your
Apple computer once you've done that
resize the window so you can drag and
drop this song that you want into your
music library if it's not in there
already
in my case it's right over here it's
called windows music I'm just going to
drag and drop this guy over to my Zune
library and then now I'm going to find
it so here it is windows music I want to
right-click on it I'm gonna hit edit and
I'm gonna make sure that the genre is on
our clock right under ringtone so
ringtone has no bushing there should be
enough it should be ringtone singler
with no s and hit OK and once you've
done that so it's actually gonna take a
little a second or two to refreshed
let's go back alright so you can see now
it says ringtone and I'm gonna drag it
and put it over this little phone icon
on my zoom player so I think the song
onto my phone and if you're on a Mac
computer just do the way you would with
your other files as far as thinking goes
and there you go you can see that that
one song was added and I'll go ahead and
show you how to set this song now as a
ringtone on the phone itself alright so
now we're looking at the phone itself
you're gonna go to settings on your
phone and then you're going to go to
ringtones and sounds now
for the file that we just transferred
over wouldn't show up here in any other
way but because we did it in the process
or in the way we did when you go to the
very top of your ringtone list you'll
see it's under custom and windows music
so I can just tap on it and you can see
now it's set as my ringtone and that is
it this is Dave informal calm thank you
for watching the video and don't forget
to visit fumble drive home for more
cellphone news reviews and how to's
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
