we've already dropped tests at the
galaxy s7 we still haven't technically
done one on the galaxy s7 edge which I'm
really curious to see how we'll handle
that side drop with its curved display
so today we're gonna be dropping it side
by side against the new iPhone 7 to see
which tech giant's flagship is more
durable but before we get into it I want
to give a big shout-out to tech 21 for
sponsoring today's video so the good
folks at tech 21 sent us their new Evo
tactical extreme case for the iPhone 7
and asked us to do what we do best and
put it to the test
and when we did the case handled the
back bottom side and face drops like it
was nothing as you can see here while
the case itself only suffered a few
minor scratches underneath the iPhone 7
is still flawless no dings no dents and
most importantly of all no cracked
screen this is thanks to tech 21s flex
Ock material that is found inside of the
case which absorbs and dissipates the
impact force and prevents it from
passing on to your device the evil
tactical case is available for both the
iPhone 7 and the galaxy s7 edge in the
number of different colors so click on
that first link down below in the
description and get your phone the
protection it deserves alright let's get
to the drop test round number one
backdrop three two one
so after that backdrop the galaxy s7
edges class gets cracked with the
majority of the damage starting at the
top left corner and then kind of spider
webbing down across the whole body man
that doesn't look pretty the iPhone 7 on
the other hand it did actually really
well with its aluminum back suffering
only a few small scuffs that's something
that you'd want to happen to your brand
new smartphone but it's nowhere near as
bad as what happened on the s7 edge so
round number one goes easily to the
iPhone 7 round number 2 bottom draw
three to one okay both won't handle that
bottom drop without sustaining too much
damage which doesn't really come as a
surprise as both have 7000 series
aluminum bands there's a few little
scuff marks here and there but honestly
unless you're a perfectionist like me
it's nothing that you can't live without
on either phone making a a draw in round
number two round number three side drop
three two one alright so the galaxy s7
edges curved screen didn't actually end
up negatively affecting it here on the
side drop for a minute there I thought
that the edge of the screen would make
contact with the concrete but it seems
like the metal band protrudes just
enough to keep it safe the iPhone 7
handled that side drop equally well
suffering only a few small scuffs along
the side making it a tie for round
number three round number four face draw
three two one
after that face drop both won't suffer a
similar fate the glass on both the
iPhone 7 and the galaxy s7 edge got
cracked with spiderwebs going just about
everywhere the screens are still fully
functional though so a bit of good news
there but overall not an impressive
result for either phone making it a draw
in round number 4 bonus round okay so
with both on surviving all four drops
they'll move on to the bonus round where
last time the iPhone 7 was able to
survive not one not two but eight
additional drops on its face before it
got TK out so today we'll see just how
many drops the Galaxy s7 edge can take
before it technically can make a phone
call three two one drop number one voted
round is a success
still going three two one oh wow
still work though
oh my god that's out of bed it survived
50 so when we tested the smaller galaxy
s7 it didn't even make it to the bonus
round so the fact that the s7 edge was
able to survive all 50 drops came as a
really big surprise
now while surviving 50 drops is
impressive we call the bonus round the
bonus round for a reason as the first
four drops are way more important in
everyday life so we've actually updated
the scoring method to reflect just this
so because the s7 edge lost pretty badly
in that backdrop it still loses here to
the iPhone 7 but it does get a ranking
that is higher than the smaller galaxy
s7 anyways that is it for me in this
video thank you guys for watching and as
always I'll see you in the very next
episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
