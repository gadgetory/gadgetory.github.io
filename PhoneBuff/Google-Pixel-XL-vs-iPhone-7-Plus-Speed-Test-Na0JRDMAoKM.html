test that has been eight years in the
making is finally here as today we're
putting the first ever phone by Google
in the Google pixel egg cell up against
the reigning speed test champ in the
iPhone 7 plus taking a look at the spec
sheet the pixel egg cell is packing the
new Snapdragon 820 one chip with four
gigabytes of RAM while the iPhone 7 plus
comes with the a10 fusion chip with
three gigabytes of RAM but again specs
are just specs and that's why we do
these speed tests but before we get into
it I want to give a big shout-out to

slash buff that's dollarshaveclub.com
slash buff alright let's get right into
it all right you know the drill we'll
kick things off by starting the stop
watches on each phone where the google
pixel XL and it's quick animations gets
the step-over the iPhone 7 plus if only
by a fraction of a second as it blows
through the first row of system apps and
is already halfway through the second
row working on Photoshop makes but as
you can see the iPhone 7 plus loads the
heavier Photoshop makes that much faster
and is already moving on to lapse it
we're due to popular demand we've
actually shortened the video being time
lapse
year from one that was 120 frames long
to about a fifth of that at 25 frames so
that way this one single task doesn't
make all the difference in the speed
test but either way the Google pixel
Excel really struggled on processing
that time-lapse allowing the iPhone 7
plus to pull a full app ahead in fact
when I compared the pixel excel and
lapse it to my 1 plus 3 it was actually
slower despite having the newer
Snapdragon 820 1 chip which due to being
under clock unfortunately doesn't seem
to offer any performance gains over the
Snapdragon 820 like you'd expect so with
the iPhone 7 plus loading subway surfers
a full 6 seconds faster and loading flip
dabbing a full 4 seconds faster it pulls
ahead by about two and a half apps as it
starts working on the last leg of this
first lab finishing up with Spotify and
moving on to ESPN so based off what we
have seen so far it seems like when the
Google pixel eye cell is faster and
loading up an app like it was in
Facebook and snapchat it's only faster
by a split second at most but when the
iPhone 7 plus is faster the difference
is much more significant with it being
anywhere from 2 seconds faster to 9
seconds faster all of which have added
up to its lead with it finishing the
first stop with a time of 1 minute and
24 seconds with the pixel Excel loading
both ESPN and Netflix 2 seconds slower
than the 7 plusted putting it even
further behind as it works on loading
both mobile and full versions of the
Amazon website finishing the first lap
23 seconds later with the time of 1
minute and 47 seconds with its three
gigabytes of RAM the iPhone 7 plus kept
all the apps open in the background
completing the speed test in 1 minute
and 55 seconds as the Google pixel Excel
is struggling a bit with it having to
reload both Facebook and snapchat
however it does have Photoshop makes and
lapses open but unfortunately it doesn't
keep subway surfers ready to go so this
is going to cost it even more here in
the speed test
so we'll fast forward to see whether or
not the pixel Excel keeps the other apps
open which it does not so disappointing
results here in the second lab you kind
of wish that Google would have included
6 gigabytes of RAM instead of only 4 on
their flagship smartphone especially
when you consider that a phone like the
oneplus 3 has 6 gigabytes of RAM despite
being $300 cheaper but either way the
Google picks
completes the speed test with a time of
3 minutes and 5 seconds making the
winner and still fumble style speed test
ramp the iPhone 7 plus thank you guys
for watching and as always I'll see you
in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
