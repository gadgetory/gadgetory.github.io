been looking for a new smartphone odds
are that the Galaxy Note 8 and the
iPhone 10 have crossed your mind because
both of these phones take a lot of the
check boxes that you want to see in a
smartphone but at the same time they
each have their own unique set of
advantages
so in this two-part Bumble style video
series we're gonna be comparing them by
looking at a bunch of reasons why the
note 8 could be considered better than
the iPhone 10 in this video and why the
iPhone 10 could be considered better
than the note 8 in the next video which
I'll be linking for you down below in
the description after watching both
videos we should have both for which
phone you thought had the stronger
reasons and they let me know why down
below in the comments anyways let's get
the show on the road improve your skill

number one bigger screen both phones
have top-notch OLED displays but one of
the key areas where they differ is in
size with the node 8 having a huge 6.3
inch display compared to the 5.8 inch
display on the iPhone 10 which
technically is even smaller than that
since the notch at the top eats up some
of that screen real estate to fast
charging adapter both the iPhone 10 and
the Galaxy Note 8 support fast charging
but the difference is unlike the iPhone
the note 8 actually comes with a fast
charging adapter in the box whereas on
the iPhone if you want fast charging you
have to cough up an extra $70 to make it
happen three cheaper speaking of extra
money the note aid is $50 cheaper than
the iPhone 10 and that's at the full
retail price but if you spent some time
looking around there's usually some kind
of deal out there where you can get it
for even less or you can have it bundled
with some of Samsung's accessories like
the gear VR or the deck station that
basically turns the note 8 into a little
desktop computer for s-pen so for most
people the S Pen isn't something that
you'll want to use every day but in
those moments when you just want to
quickly drop something down or you want
to draw it's really nice to have
especially with the new screen off mode
where you can write on the screen
even when the phone is locked reason
number five Samson pay so Apple pay is
great when you can use it but the
problem is you can't always use it
you're limited to just the retailers
that support NFC payments and while that
list is growing on the note 8 you can
use your phone to pay pretty much
anywhere you can physically swipe a
credit card 6 micro SD slot having a
micro SD slot on your phone means that
you won't be stuck with just a built-in
storage that comes with the phone
because if you do end up needing more
storage later on you can just pop in a
relatively inexpensive micro SD card for
up to an additional 256 gigabytes of
storage 7 quick camera launch with a
double press of the power button from
anywhere or any app whether the screen
is on or off you can quickly launch the
camera so you won't have to fumble
around looking for the camera icon
during one of those Kodak moments 8
scrolling screen shots with scroll
capture you can take extended screen
shots that automatically scroll the
screen down for as long as you want
which is perfect for when you want to
screenshot something like an entire
article or when you want to share a text
conversation with a friend 9 smart
select but if you don't want to take a
screenshot of the entire screen you can
take a selective screen shot of exactly
what you want without the hassle of
having to crop out anything after the
fact and my favorite part about this
feature is smart select also lets you
extract text from these selective screen
shots so you can copy and paste text
that you can never copy on the iPhone
reason number 10 multitasking the no
date has that big beautiful display and
thankfully Samsung actually takes
advantage of it there's a split screen
mode which allows you to run two apps at
once which is great but my personal
favorite and the thing that I use most
often is pin to top where you can pan a
specific portion of something to the
corner of the screen and have it stay
there for as long as you want as you
jump in and out of other apps 11 apps
killing both of these phones have the
newer taller displays that became
popular in 2017 but the problem is on
the iPhone 10 a lot of the apps still
don't support the new aspect ratio over
half of the 130 apps that I personally
use aren't yet supported whereas on the
note eight almost all of them are
natively supported and even when they
aren't you can manually have them fill
the entire screen with Samsung scaling
feature leading to less wasted space and
consistent UI 12 scheduled messages you
can schedule your text messages to be
sent at any time in the future for
example say you're up late one night and
you want to message somebody but you
don't want to wake them up you can just
type in your message and schedule it to
automatically send to them the next
morning there's a bunch of other use
case scenarios like sending reminders
and birthday wishes but ultimately it's
just a great way to automate the
messages that you know you're gonna send
anyways 13 battery indicators not only
can you have the battery percentage
displayed up in the status bar which due
to the nagy the iphone 10 can't but the
note can also give you estimates for how
long the battery will actually last you
or even how long it'll take to fully
charge when it's plugged in 14 edge
panel with edge panel you could take
advantage of the curved screen on the no
date with panels of your favorite apps
and shortcuts so that way you can
conveniently access them from anywhere
with just a swipe from the edge of the
screen reason number 15 dual assistance
so the Galaxy Note 8 has this one-two
punch when it comes to virtual
assistants it's got the Google assistant
built-in which for the most part is more
capable than Siri but it also has Bixby
which is Samsung's all new assistant
that you can ask to do things on your
phone that most other assistants can't
do from blocking the last number who
called you to marking all of your unread
emails as read so together it's like
having the ultimate assistance 16
clipboard going beyond just your basic
copy and paste the note 8 lets you copy
up to 20 different pieces of text and
photos to the clipboard so you're not
limited to copying and pasting just one
thing at a time which can be a huge
time-saver 17 faster overall performance
as we saw in our fumble of style speed
test the extra 3 gigabytes of RAM on the
note 8 adds up to a faster smartphone
experience with more of your app staying
open in the background and not needing
to be reloaded as often 18 notification
cues on the no dates you have multiple
ways to be alerted about a new
notification it can let you know through
the always-on display there's an LED
notification light that flashes
different colors depending on where the
notification came from and with smart
alert the phone can even vibrate as soon
as you pick it up letting you know you
have a new message 19 ultra power saving
mode sometimes you just won't have
access to a charger but with the note 8
you'll be able to keep
going with ultra power saving mode which
basically turns the smartphone into a
dumb phone that can extend your battery
life from just a few hours all the way
up to a few days reason number 20
headphone jack unlike the iPhone 10 the
Galaxy Note 8 still has a headphone jack
meaning you won't have to ditch your
fancy headphones or carry around an
adapter 21 no camera home.the no dates
cameras sit flush against the back
allowing you to use it while the phone
is lying flat on a table without it
wobbling back and forth like crazy like
the iPhone does with its chunky camera
hump 22 secure folder secure folder uses
defense grade technology to help keep
your most sensitive data whether it's a
photo and email or an app private and
completely separate from the rest of
your phone so if you install an app
insecure folder that app won't show up
outside of the password protected folder
even if you go in and install that app
outside of the secure folder it'll be a
completely separate version of the app
with none of the same information 23
creates a gift whether you're watching
your own video or a video on social
media you could turn it into a gift
easily by selecting exactly what you
want on your screen to be in the gift
and then just hit the record button the
phone takes care of the rest
automatically giving you a gift that you
can share with your friends
24 themes on the note 8 you're not stuck
with the same old look that everybody
else has you can truly make the phone
your own with hundreds of custom themes
and icons that can change the way your
phone looks system-wide and finally
reason number 25 separate apps sound
when connected to a Bluetooth speaker
you can set it so only the audio from
your music app is routed to the speaker
with audio from all other apps being
played back on the phone itself this is
great for when you're playing DJ at a
party or listen to music in your car and
you don't want to interrupt the music
while you open up something like
snapchat the snapshot audio will stay on
your phone while the music still goes on
uninterrupted alright so those are the
top 25 reasons why the no dates could be
considered better than the iPhone 10 but
remember the word better is subjective
so be sure to watch the iPhone tense
version which will be linked for you
down below in the description now before
I jump out of here I want to give a big
thanks to Skillshare for sponsoring
today's episode Skillshare is an online
learning community for creators with
more than
17000 classes in videography app
development and more one of the
questions that I get a lot is what do I
use to make my videos here on YouTube
and the answer is Adobe Premiere it's a
super powerful tool that can help you
make anything from like a simple
unboxing video to a full-on future film
but one of the downsides is it does come
with a pretty steep learning curve but
with Skillshare you can take a bunch of
online classes covering everything from
just the basics to the more advanced
tutorials premium memberships begin at
