comm and in this video I'll be doing a
review on the player pro music player
app available from the Google Play Store
so first off I want to give you a quick
review or a walkthrough of the app so
you have your songs tab where it imports
all the songs on your phone you have
your albums tab which loads up all the
albums on on your phone of course but it
also loads up all the album art
automatically so as soon as you download
the app and it starts reading your music
it'll download the album or
automatically does the same thing with
the artist so all the artists you have
on your phone it'll download a picture
of them which is pretty cool I haven't
seen that on many other music players
out there it'll even download pictures
for your John Russo you know dance or
electronic or R&amp;amp;B and hip hop it
downloads this little pictures to make
everything just look more visually
appealing you have these little tabs for
a playlist so you can see your recently
played top rated most played etc you can
also take a look at your videos with the
player Pro app and of course you could
look at the folder your media folders
here too and if you wanted to adjust the
order of the tabs you can just press and
hold on one and drag it over so you can
see I dragged over music but of course
our video start site I don't really use
videos that often so I'm going to drag
it right back and I will go back to
songs and show you what the player
itself looks like so it shows the album
art in the middle you have the play
button the skip and rewind button you
have the button right button right here
for repeating the song so you can press
it and it actually highlights screen to
repeat all the songs you press it again
and it just repeats the current song
that you're playing and then if you
press this guy right here it shuffles
your songs so a few different things you
can do also you can control the volume
right from here and it has a cool little
green highlighting effect when you're
covering the volume which lets you know
exactly you know where your finger is or
if you're actually grabbing the volume
button you also have this button right
here which opens up the equalizer and of
course this guy takes you back to your
now playing list and this guy over here
just takes you back to where you
were so that's a quick walkthrough of
the app I'm gonna show you the settings
really quick and to let you know which
you have of course you have the same
options available on the player at the
top of the menu option but when you go
to settings you can choose where are
what music folders this app uses to
import music from you could also change
the rating system refresh the media
store this option is basically as soon
as you download a new song our import a
new song onto your phone
you hit refresh and it Reis cans your
phone which is nice you can also change
the look and feel so if you want to
change the theme and the way the app
looks you could do that you could also
change the way the album or show up and
if you wanted to download the album arts
from the id3 Network you know when a
network connection is available you can
do that as well so there's a whole bunch
of options to customize this app just to
the way you want of course you can do
the same thing with the lockscreen so if
it shows up on the lockscreen
and there's even a few settings where if
you shake it or shake your phone it'll
skip to the previous or next song
depending on how you shake the phone so
those are just a few of the options one
of my favorite things about this app is
the widget though so I'll go ahead and
add the widget to my homescreen really
quick let me see if I can find it all
right there it is so because of the
Galaxy Nexus I have a bigger screen and
they have all different types of sizes
in this case I'm used a four by four
drop it right onto my home screen and
you can see even over here I have I
could select the skin which if I want
the artists picture instead of the album
picture but you know I'd rather have the
album and there's a few other options
that you could customize for the widget
itself its save and it shows up when
you're home feeling like that you hit
play and you can control all your songs
of course we want to repeat this song
you could press the repeat button right
over here
so the which is pretty functional as
well which is definitely a plus for me
and overall I just have to say I really
recommend it it's selling for five
dollars in the Google Play Store and
honestly I think it's worth every penny
all right let's informing this review
