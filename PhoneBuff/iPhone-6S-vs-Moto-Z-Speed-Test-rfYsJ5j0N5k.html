have a speed test with yet another
android flagship another contender which
will try to do the same thing that other
Android phones before have tried to do
which is to dethrone the iPhone 6s and
become the new fastest smartphone in the
world
taking a look at the spec sheet de moto
Z is packing the Snapdragon 820
processor and four gigabytes of RAM
under the hood along with a quad HD
resolution and while the iPhone 6s has
just a dual core a nine chip with two
gigabytes of RAM it does benefit from a
lower resolution display but as you guys
know specs are just specs that's why we
do these presets here a bomb buff so
with that said let's go ahead and get
right into it alright so we'll start
this thing like we always do by starting
these stop watches on each phone and
then jumping into the first row of
system apps where the Moto Z's faster
animations give it the early lead as it
moves on to the gaming row with a bit of
a head start and if the last beat tests
are any indication it's going to need as
much help as you can get as the iPhone
6s has proven to be a beast in this
gaming row with it already passing the
Moto Z and Subway's servers to gain lead
as it finishes up Angry Birds
so about halfway through this first lap
the iPhone 6s is proving why it's the
undefeated fumble style speed test champ
with a pulling even further ahead now
almost a full lap in front of the Moto Z
of course there is still plenty of time
for a comeback
we've seen it happen with other phones
plenty of times before so it can
certainly happen here again if the Moto
Z can somehow manage to start chipping
away at the iPhones lead one app at a
time and if the Moto Z can go faster in
any one app its best chance at a
comeback is here in laps it where both
ones create a time-lapse from the same
exact video file but as you can see the
iPhone success is just about done with
laps it finishing it up and moving on to
ESPN
the moto Z appears to be processing the
time-lapse at a much slower rate than
the iPhone and it's dual-core a nine
chip so as the Moto Z is busy trying to
get through the most processor intensive
tasks in the speed test the iPhone
success is just blazing through the last
bit of this first lap loading both the
mobile and full versions of the Amazon
website so there you go the iPhone
finishes the first lap with the time of
1 minute and 21 seconds with the Moto Z
still working on the last few apps
before it gets a chance to join the
iPhone in the second lap and bad news
for the Moto Z the iPhone isn't showing
any signs of slowing down in the second
lap with it having every app so far open
in the background as the Moto Z finally
finishes the first lap 20 seconds after
the iPhone with a time of 1 minute and
41 seconds the iPhone is dashing to the
finish line reopening the last few apps
without a hitch and completing the
second lap with a total time of 1 minute
and 51 seconds so despite having all the
apps ready to go in the background in
the second lap it was just too little
too late for the Moto Z with the phone
finishing the speed test with a total
time of 2 minutes and 6 seconds making
the winner and still full of style speed
test champ the iPhone 6s thank you guys
for watching and as always I'll see you
in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
