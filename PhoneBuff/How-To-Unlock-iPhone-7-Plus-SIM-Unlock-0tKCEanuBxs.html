quick video I'm gonna show you how to
sim unlock the iPhone 7 it's worth
noting that this method also works for
the iPhone 7 plus and pretty much any
other iPhone out there now right up
front I do want to let you know that
this method isn't free it does cost some
money but the money you can potentially
save on rowing charges and the resale
value it adds back to your phone could
make it well worth the cost so the first
thing you're going to want to do is turn
off Find My iPhone which you can do by
going into the settings then iCloud then
Find My iPhone and then flip the switch
to the off position once you've done
that go back to the home screen and open
up the dialer and dial star pound zero
six pound to bring up your iPhones IMEI
number write this number down and make
sure that you get it right as you're
gonna need it later the next step is to
get the unique unlock code that your
phone needs from an unlocking service
our sponsors and trusted sources unlock
River so we'll be using them here where
all you have to do is enter in your
information so in my case the carrier is
AT&amp;amp;T United States but make sure to
select whichever carrier your iPhone is
actually locked to so manufacturer is
obviously Apple we're unlocking the
iPhone 7 and then we're going to enter
in that IMEI number that we got earlier
making sure to double check that it's
entered correctly finally putting your
valid email address as this is where
your unlock confirmation will be sent so
as you can see here the unlock could
take a while to process for me it was
just a few hours but in some cases it
can take up to a few business days after
that just hit unlock to complete your
purchase and soon enough you'll get an
email that looks something like this
telling you that your iPhone 7 has been
unlocked and from here all you have to
do is enter in an unaccepted SIM card so
basically any SIM card that isn't from
the carrier your phone is locked too so
in my case since the phone is locked to
AT&amp;amp;T I'll enter in a t-mobile SIM card
and then all you have to do is connect
the phone to Wi-Fi and that's it your
iPhone will be officially unlocked if
you don't have Wi-Fi available you can
always just connect your phone to iTunes
and that'll do the trick as well but
anyways that is it for me in this video
thank you guys for watching and as
always I'll see you
the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
