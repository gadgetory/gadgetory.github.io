10 is finally here so you guys know what
that means it's time for a foam buff
style drop test where we'll be dropping
it side by side next to the larger
iphone aids plus to see how apple's
latest flagship smartphones compare when
it comes to durability but before we get
into it I want to give a big thanks to
tech 21 for sponsoring today's episode
so when we tested the Evo check case for
the iPhone 10 it handled the back corner
and phase drops without a problem
tech 21 protects to drop up the drop
with the iPhone 10 we tested still being
in perfect condition this is thanks to a
scientifically proven material with a
three layer protection system that
spreads out and absorbs the impact
energy preventing it from passing on to
your device
the Evo check case is available for both
the iPhone 10 and the iPhone 8 plus in a
number of different colors so click on
that link down below in the description
and get your phone the protection it
deserves
alright let's get to the drop test round
number one backdrop in three two one all
right after that backdrop both phones
still remain fully functional however
there's a big difference when it comes
to the damage on the back the iPhone 8
plus has this rear glass completely
shattered while the iPhone 10 actually
fared really well like it didn't go
completely undamaged the camera lens did
get some nasty scuffs and there's a
really small crack at the edge towards
the middle of the phone but overall a
really impressive result for the iPhone
10 and an easy win for it here in round
number one round number two corner drop
three to one
so the corner drop doesn't do all that
much damage to either phone however the
scratches on the iPhone A+ definitely do
look worse that's not to say that the
iPhone 10 didn't get scratched it did
but the stainless-steel band makes those
scratches look almost imperceptible
giving the edge to the iPhone 10 in
round number 2 round number 3 face drop
and 3 2 1 unfortunately after that face
drop both phones have their front glass
cracked I was really hoping the iPhone
10 would do as well as it did in the
back drop but without that big ol
protruding camera lens to protect it the
top left of the phone gets fractured but
while disappointing the results is a
better one than the result on the iPhone
8 plus where not only did the phone get
cracked along the bottom but it also has
more severe shattering along the top
right giving the way into the iPhone 10
in round number 3 bonus round okay so
with both phones still being technically
usable we entered the bonus round where
we drop each phone directly on to steal
from much higher up which should put the
shock and impact resistance of each
phone to the test
last time the iPhone 8 plus was able to
survive eight bonus drops before its
screen stopped being fully functional
with it getting severely damaged on the
front in the back with its rear camera
actually failing to work so let's see if
the iPhone 10 can do any better
three two one there's no app that
sounded so bad I heard I heard a glass
crunching so um oh okay now it is
working let me let me make sure to
really test it yeah it's still good and
three two one
three two one jeez jeez
oh okay look at that
got shattering all over so that's what
it took to actually shatter the glass on
the iPhone 10 but it does appear like
the glass or the screen is still working
so we're good to go on drop and
abracadabra all right
just more of the same more shattering
but the screen oh wait huh okay that's
interesting looks like I can't whew oh
so the bottom of the screen has lost a
little bit of functionality there that's
interesting I don't know how to go home
from here
so unlock no I can't unlock it says
swipe up to unlock I can't no okay so
after five drops the iPhone ten swipe up
gesture no longer works which obviously
on a phone that relies on that gesture
to unlock and to go to the home screen
is a really big problem so while we did
find a workaround to get to the home
screen by going through the camera app
and then using the phone in landscape
it's just too much of a hassle to do
every time without using assistive touch
so we decided to throw in the towel but
the really weird thing about this result
was the bottom of the touchscreen still
seems to work fine like you're able to
press on the icons down there and you're
even able to slide between apps but no
matter what we did and no matter how
many times we tried we just couldn't get
the swipe up gesture to work however the
good news is after doing our 10 point
inspection that we do after each round
the rest of the phone still remains
fully functional including the camera
and face ID all right with all four
rounds in the books let's take a look at
the score card we're in the first round
the iPhone 10 did significantly better
than the eights plus it's stainless
steel band helped give it the edge in
round number two with it also suffering
less damage in round number three and
then in the fourth the iPhone 8 plus was
finally able to squeak out an ugly win
but only just barely making the over
winner in this drop test the iPhone 10
anyways that is it for me in this video
thank you guys for watching and as
always I'll see you in the very next
episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
