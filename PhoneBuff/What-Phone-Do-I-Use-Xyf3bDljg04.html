that I get asked all the time whether
it's here on youtube or on Facebook or
Twitter is hey David what phone do you
personally use as your daily driver and
it's a good question right I mean I have
access to all these phones I get to test
all these phones and because we have
them here at the office I can switch
back and forth between them whenever I
want but before I answer the question of
which phone I'm using right now let's
jump back to 2012 when phonebook really
started picking up steam and kind of
work our way back up so we'll start off
with the Galaxy Nexus which being a pure
Android fan at heart was my go-to phone
in 2012 but then I switched to the
galaxy s3 and then another Samsung phone
and the Galaxy Note 2 from there I
switched to the HTC One m7 and then back
to Samsung with the note 3 I tried the
galaxy s5 for a little bit before
switching to the iPhone 6 plus which was
actually the first time I'd ever went
with an iPhone as my daily driver
I used the iPhone 6 plus for almost a
full year before I switched back to
Android with a note 5 in late 2015 which
brings us to 2016 so from all these
phones here I've actually only used
three of them as my daily driver so far
the first was the galaxy s7 edge as
coming from the note 5 and loving the
note 5 it was the easy choice offering
an even better screen a better camera
water and dust resistance and a bunch of
other little features that I just had to
have but I didn't switch to just any s7
edge even though I live here in the US I
went with the international variant with
the Exynos processor since it was so
much faster than the snapdragon variant
and I have to say that experience was
probably one of the best smartphone
experiences I have ever had the phone
just felt fully loaded and for the most
part it had all the bases covered but
there was one problem the Exynos variant
doesn't support full LTE and Samson pay
here in the US and while it may do for a
while eventually the slow data speeds
got to me and I decided what the hell
I'll go with the s7 edge with the
Snapdragon variant and just give it a
shot and for a while the slower
performance didn't really bother me
until about a few months into it where
it started to really bogged down
I remember going to my car and you know
I was getting ready to leave work I was
texting my girlfriend and trying to get
my music started before I drove off and
the phone just locked up on me and then
the same thing happened the next week so
I got fed up with it to the point where
I just wanted a phone that was fast and
had fast data which led me to the phone
that I am using today and that phone is
the 1 plus 3 now I know what some of you
may be thinking David why are you using
a $400 phone when you have a 700 or
phone or even $800 phone that is way
better and you know honestly I ask
myself the same thing I mean I know that
overall the s7 edge and especially the
note 7 is a better phone but the thing
is while the better screen and the
better camera and all the other bells
and whistles are nice and definitely
make the smart phone experience better
for me there's one thing that can kill
even the best smartphone experience
which is a relatively slow and laggy
phone so without giving up Android which
if you can tell based off the phones
that I've used in the past I'm generally
an Android guy the oneplus 3 was my best
option if you've seen the speed test
with the 1 plus 3 you know that it's the
fastest Android phone available right
now with 6 gigabytes of RAM and an
optimized UI so the thing just flies but
at the same time I do miss the better
screen the better camera and all the
other features that came with the Galaxy
phones so there's this trade-off that
you have to make and at the moment I'm
trading the best screen and the best
camera available on Android for the best
performance and arguably the best
customization available on Android
there's definitely other things I like
about the oneplus that you can't get on
any of these other phones but it really
boils down to those two things it's a
personal preference of course and
there's all different sorts of ways you
can look at it if you want the best
overall smartphone and you like Android
you can go with the note 7 if you like
iOS and want the best overall smartphone
you go to the iPhone 7 plus if you want
a really good smartphone and maybe a
SmartWatch to go along with it for a
price that's less than either of these
two you can go with the oneplus three or
maybe you just want a wide-angle camera
which you can get on the LG g5 it comes
down to personal preference all these
phones offer a unique combination of
pros and cons and that's exactly why we
do the reasons comparisons here at Bombo
but as of right now
phone that claims the spot in my pocket
is the 1+3 will that change yeah most
likely
I'm actually really thinking about
switching to the iPhone 7 plus where I
can get the fastest performance on any
smartphone without having to give up
things like an awesome camera a great
screen and water and dust resistance but
of course if I do that I have to give up
Android which is a completely different
argument or who knows maybe those
rumored pixel phones from Google will be
enough to keep me on Android I guess
we'll just have to wait and see let me
know if you guys want a follow-up video
on whether I do or don't switch phones
down below in the comments let me know
what features are most important to you
in a smartphone but anyways that is it
for me in this video thank you guys for
watching and as always I'll see you in
the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
