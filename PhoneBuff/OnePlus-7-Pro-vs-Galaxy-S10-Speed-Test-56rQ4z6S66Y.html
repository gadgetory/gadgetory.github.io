was it awarded smartphone of the year
from the likes of mkbhd but it also held
the top spot in our speedtest rankings
for most of the year with its rain
actually going for 16 consecutive months
dating all the way back to mid 2017 with
1 plus 5 which you know and the
fast-moving world of tech is a pretty
impressive streak of course all good
things come to an end and that's exactly
what happened to 1 plus when it went up
against the iPhone 10s max losing his
title to that phone which subsequently
lost its title just a few months later
to the galaxy s 10 Plus which brings us
to the matchup that we have here today
where the SL plus coming fresh off a
title defense against Huawei's P 30 Pro
is going up against a phone that was
built for speed in the 1 + 7 Pro just
like the Galaxy S 10 + d1 + 7 has the
same Snapdragon a 55 processor but
despite its lower price point
it comes with faster u FS 3.0 storage a
whopping 12 gigabytes RAM and even a 90
Hertz display now both samsung n1 + say
that their phones learn to get faster
over time based off how you use the
phone so we made sure to do plenty of
training with each phone by like
basically running our tests over and
over across multiple days but the time
has a finally come
will the galaxy is 10 + remain fumble
style speed test champ or will 1 +
reclaim the title that it held for so
long before as the fastest smartphone in
the world let's find out
after the test check out the official
fumble of style rankings on our website
at the link below which we created with

new website up and running in a matter
of minutes
so tap into the power of your smartphone
and AI and build your own website for
free at the first link down below ok
we'll get this championship matchup
started by heading into the first row
where the sm+ is able to pull ahead in
facebook with the 1 + 7 Pro quickly
recovering in Starbucks putting the two
phones neck and neck here in Microsoft
Word where each phone is loading up the
same 500 page documents looks like the 1
+ 7 Pro is able to take the lead by
loading the document up first which may
in part be due to its faster ufs 3.0
storage the phones perform roughly the
same through Excel and despite its
pop-up selfie cam the oneplus it didn't
give up too much ground in the camera
test here in Snapseed we've made things
a little more intensive this time around
adding not one but two different filters
to the same exact photo where the 1 + 7
Pro is it was to complete the task at a
faster rate we'll see if we can continue
that trend here in lab sites where each
one will have to process the same exact
video clip and so far it looks like the
1 + 7 Pro is doing so at a significantly
faster rates adding onto its lead with
it already moving ahead to the browser
test with the sm+ finally finishing up
with lop sides it has dug itself into a
bit of a hole here you won't play 7 Pro
is already working on the gaming row so
it'll take a significant push from the
SM Plus in order for it to make a
comeback that said there is a chance the
1 + 7 Pro may not be able to sustain its
high level of performance given that it
has that extra load of its 90 Hertz
display but at least so far it isn't
showing any signs of
weakness with the phone ripping through
fit the fats and moving on to the last
game here in bullet force now with the
title of thumb of style spice hash champ
on the line the galaxy's temp plus has
gotta make a move before the end of this
first lap as I don't expect either of
these phones to have any issues in the
second lap given their large amounts of
RAM but unfortunately for the S temp
plus it loads bullet force at a slower
rate while the one +7 Pro blazed through
both Spotify and ESPN allowing the seven
pro to pull a full app ahead late here
in the first lap with its clocking in an
impressive time of 2 minutes and 2
seconds with the sm+ taking a full 7
seconds longer to do the same finishing
the first lap with a time of 2 minutes
and 9 seconds again I don't expect there
to be much of a difference here in the
second lap given that both phones have
just an absurd amount of RAM and so far
that's exactly what we're seeing both
phones have kept all the apps open and
ready to go in the background and both
phones are actually doing a good job at
switching from app to app pretty
smoothly I am impressed with how little
of an issue that pop-up camera was in
terms of speed for the oneplus 7 pro for
some reason I thought that it would slow
it down but no it finishes the entire
test with flying colors and a time of 2
minutes and 35 seconds with the sm+
finishing 12 seconds later with a time
of 2 minutes and 43 seconds making the
winner and the new bump of style speed
test champ the 1 plus 7 pro for the
updated speed test rankings be sure to
check out our website at the link below
but anyways that is it for me in this
video thank you guys for watching and as
always I'll see you in the very next
episode
