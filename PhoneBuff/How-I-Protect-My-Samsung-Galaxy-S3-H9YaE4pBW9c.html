calm and in this video I'll be talking
about how I protect my Samsung Galaxy s3
so uh first thing you'll notice on my
phone is that I do have the zag
invisible shield screen cover not sure
if that's coming through on camera you
can kind of see the screen cover right
over here the edges of it you see
obviously leaves open the sensor to the
front-facing camera in the earpiece so
you could here and at the bottom it
leaves open the button so you could
press this guy kind of could see the
little lines right there I don't know if
that's coming through but anyway that's
how I protect my screen you know the
screen cover is one of my favorite I
actually did a how-to on the channel on
how to put this guy on you know without
any air ball as you guys can see I have
no air bubbles spit on really nicely
I'll go ahead and do a quick little
scratch test this guy show you guys but
you know you can scratch the phone up
and you know a little scratch marks of
course are gonna show on the screen
cover itself we wipe them off most of
time that's the really deep but at the
end of the day you're really just trying
to protect your screen
I usually protect my phones with the
Distronic Kay so I got one for the
Galaxy s3 as well wipe off the dust on
there so anyway I like to start this
drawing case because it's a matte black
and it's a premium case I mean it looks
really nice and got it off Amazon so
anyway the problem I had with my galaxy
s3 though is when I tried to use these
two together as far as the screen cover
and the case what happens is I get a
little bit of lift on the screen cover
so you get you can see right there a
little bubble came and over time it gets
a little bit worse it doesn't mostly on
the bottom right and I think that's
because I didn't put it on like exactly
perfectly so you guys see a little bit
what I can just like kind of press it
away like that but as you can see I
didn't put it you know exactly in the
center it's a little bit more to the
right you know if you see the the
separation from the button to the line
right here versus here it's a little bit
more room here so obviously I could have
shifted a little bit over to the left
and also I could have put it maybe a
little bit higher but it's really hard
to do to get it exactly perfect but you
know usually up in fine in the past I
mean I did it to my Galaxy Nexus
right here and I have my Distronic case
on here and no problem I mean I've had
this for a while I even did a video
about you know how I protect my guy
looks nice is a while ago but anyway
works really well and absolutely loved
it I did also to my HTC One S but I've
been having issues with my galaxy s3 I'm
not sure if is this this specific phone
or if it's just cuz I did up you know
they didn't do a decent job but you know
if you look at my Galaxy Nexus I didn't
really do that great of a job either I'm
I didn't get it exactly perfectly
centered as you can see you know there's
some room on the edge over here and not
that much room here on this edge so I
got it more so to the left but I get
absolutely no lip or bubble problems so
anyway that's that kind of sucks I mean
I'm probably gonna end up taking this
guy off unlike the Galaxy Nexus the
galaxy s3 has a Gorilla Glass 2 screen
so probably gonna be scratch resistant I
rather have the case because you know if
I drop this guy yeah I mean I like to
have the screen cover because it's an
attractive screen and you know what the
beautiful screen like that of course
you'd want that but it's not gonna
protect the edges if I don't put the
case I'm not gonna be able to rock it
with together I don't know I'm kind of
weird like that I don't like having an
air bubble so anyway probably gonna be
rocking it with the case probably gonna
take off this screen cover kind of sucks
but hopefully the Gorilla Glass holds up
and actually you know keeps it from
getting scratched
anyway we swim to make a quick video
about it for you guys to let you guys
know how I protect my phone so I'm gonna
be taking this guy off soon and I
probably can do a another video of
scratching the heck out of it just to
kind of show you guys how well this
screen cover works because I'm taking
off you can actually could already see I
already did a video while ago I didn't
post it yet but scratch my screen and
this is not coming off so I did
definitely scratch into the screen but
anyway I'm talking a lot I just wanted
to show you guys that quick video anyway
thanks for watching if you found the
video helpful as far as you know maybe
you shouldn't get this screen cover and
a case together cuz you might have
issues like this hit the like button and
subscribe the channel thank you for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
