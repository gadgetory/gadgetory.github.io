and in this video I'll be talking about
how I protect my samsung galaxy s3 so uh
first thing you'll notice on my phone is
that I do have the zagg invisible shield
screen cover not sure if that's coming
through on camera you can kind of see
the screen cover right over here the
edges of it you see obviously leaves
open the sensor to the front facing
camera the earpiece so you can hear and
at the bottom it leaves open the button
so you can press this guy kind of could
see the little lines right there on top
that's coming through but anyway that's
how we protect my screen you know the
screen cover is one my favorite I
actually did a how-to on the channel on
how to put this guy on you know without
any air ball as you guys can see I have
no air bubbles spit on really nicely
I'll go ahead and do a quick little
scratched as a sketch show you guys but
you know we can scratch the phone up and
no little scratch marks of course are
going to show on the screen cover itself
we wipe them off most of time that's the
really deep but at the end of the day
you really just trying to protect your
screen um I usually protect my phones
with the Distronic k so I got one for
the galaxy s three as well wipe off the
dust on there so anyway I like to start
this chronic case because it's a matte
black and it's a premium case I mean it
looks really nice and got it off amazon
so anyway the problem I have with my
galaxy s3 though is when I probably use
these two together as far as the screen
cover and the case what happens is I get
a little bit of lift on the screen cover
so you get you can see right there a
little bubble came and over time it gets
a little bit worse it doesn't mostly on
the bottom right and I think that's
because I didn't put it on like exactly
perfectly um so you guys see a little
bit what I can just like kind of press
it away like that but as you can see I
didn't put it you know exactly in the
center is a little bit more to the right
you know if you see that the separation
from the button to the line right here
versus here it's a little bit more room
here so obviously i could have shifted a
little bit over to the left and also i
could have put it may be a little bit
higher but it's really hard to do to get
it exactly perfect but you know usually
up and find the past I mean I did it to
my galaxy nexus right here and i have my
distronic case on here and no problem
mean I've had this for a while I even
did
video but you know how I protect my
galaxy-eyes is a while ago but anyway
works really well and absolutely love it
i did also to my HTC One S but I've been
having issues with my galaxy s3 i'm not
sure if this is this specific phone or
if it's just cuz i did up you know it
didn't do a decent job but you know if
you look at my galaxy nexus i didn't
really do that great of a job you time I
didn't get it exactly perfectly centered
as you can see you know there's some
room on the edge over here and not that
much room here on this edge so I got it
more so to the left but I get absolutely
no lip core bubble problems so anyway
that's that kind of sucks i mean i'm
probably going to end up taking this guy
off unlike the galaxy nexus the galaxy
s3 has a gorilla glass 2 screen so
probably going to be scratch resistant i
rather have the case because you know if
i drop this guy yeah i mean i like to
have the screen cover because the
protective screen and you know what the
beautiful swing like that of course
you'd want that but it's not gonna
protect the edges if I don't put the
case I'm not going to be able to rock it
with together and I'm kind of weird like
that I don't like having an air bubble
so anyway probably to be rocking it with
the case probably take off this screen
cover kind of sucks but hopefully the
gorilla glass holds up and actually you
know keeps it from getting scratched
anyway we swim to make a quick video
about it for you guys to let you guys
know how I protect my phone so let me be
taking this guy off soon and I probably
can do it another video of scratching
the heck out of it just to kind of show
you guys how well this screen cover
works because I'm taking off you
actually could already see I already did
a video while ago I didn't post it yet
but scratch my screen and this is not
coming off so I did definitely scratch
into the screen but anyway I'm talking a
lot I just wanted to show you guys that
quick but anyway thanks for watching if
you found the video helpful as far as
you know maybe you shouldn't get this
screen cover and the case together
because you might have issues like this
