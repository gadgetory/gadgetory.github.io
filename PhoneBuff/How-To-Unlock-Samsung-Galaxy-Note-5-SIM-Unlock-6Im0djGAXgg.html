quick video I'm gonna show you the
easiest way to sim unlock the samsung
galaxy note 5 allow you to use it with
any GSM carrier or SIM card that you
want both here in the States and when
you travel abroad so right up front I
want to let you guys know that this
method isn't free it does cost some
money but the money you can potentially
save on roaming charges if you travel
and the resale value it actually asks
your phone when you unlock it can make
the cost well worth it so the process is
actually very simple the first step is
to find the IMEI number for your phone
the quickest way to do this is to open
up your dialer and dial star hash zero
six hash and you'll get a prompt listing
the phone's IMEI next step is to go to
unlockriver.com
where you'll actually be able to get
that unique unlock code your phone needs
and just enter in your phone's
information so in my case we're locking
the 18 of the galaxy note 5 so we'll
select AT&amp;amp;T United States manufacturer
is obviously Samsung and out of this
huge list of Samsung phones you can
unlock find the galaxy note 5 and then
enter in the IMEI number that we got
earlier making sure that you double
check that you entered it in correctly
and then finally type in a valid email
address where you want the unlock code
sent to and then just hit unlock note
that the price with the unlock code
varies depending on the carrier and the
phone your unlocking in my case is
$44.99 with a delivery time between 1
and 72 hours and my experiences usually
takes around two hours but obviously it
could take up to 72 so be patient
anyways once you've paid for the unlock
code within 1 to 72 hours you'll get an
email that looks something like this
giving you the unlock code you need once
you have that turn off the galaxy note 5
insert a non-accepted sim card so in my
case since this is an AT&amp;amp;T phone we're
just going to insert an old t-mobile SIM
card I had laying around and then power
the phone's back on when it's done
booting up you'll get a message saying
invalid sim which is obvious since it's
locked to AT&amp;amp;T and all you have to do is
just unlock the phone and it'll
literally ask you for an unlock code at
which point you can enter in the exact
unlock code you got from the email and
boom your phone is officially unlocked
easy right okay guys that is pretty much
it for me in this video plenty of note5
coverage is still in the way so stay
tuned to the channel thank you guys for
watching and as always I'll see you guys
in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
