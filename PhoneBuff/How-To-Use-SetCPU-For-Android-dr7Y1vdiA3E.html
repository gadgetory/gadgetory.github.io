calm and today I'll be doing a quick
video on how to use setcpu for android
in order to be able to use this app you
do need to have root permissions on your
phone otherwise you won't be able to
actually change the clock speeds so with
that said I'll go ahead and open up the
app you'll be taken to this screen where
you have two options you could hit Auto
detect speeds which is recommended or
you can show other frequency sets like I
said recommended to choose this one but
if for some reason this doesn't work you
can hit this guy and it'll give you a
list of phones or processors that you
can choose from this choose whatever one
best matches your phone but like I said
only do that after you've tried this one
and if it doesn't work so let's go ahead
and select that for now and I'm just
going to say it's got requesting root so
I hit OK because he's been granted Super
User permissions if you get a pop-up
which you probably will the first time
you run this app it's going to ask you
to allow it or deny it hit allow and
make sure the little remember box is
checked alright so after you do that
you'll be taken to the main tab and from
here you can actually change the clock
speeds so at the top bar you have the
maximum clock speed and then at the
bottom bar you about you've got the
minimum and my phone is that currently
set at a thousand so I'll go ahead and
change this to 1200 and you can see the
values right over here underneath in
green
change as I slide this guy over if they
don't actually change there's a good
chance that what you're doing isn't
actually working if you're running an
HTC device what you'd want to do is hit
menu and go to know if you guys can see
that per flock to Saylor you're going to
hit that and it should disable the per
flock that comes with some HTC devices
and then after you do that you'll be
able to actually change the clock speeds
but a thing to note is most kernels
including the stock ones don't allow you
to overclock you actually have to have a
custom kernel that allows for
overclocking before you could actually
push it past the factory default so I
have a custom kernel it's the overstock
two point four point one for the Samsung
Vibrant there's a review on that on
phone both calm and there's also a how
to video on phone wealth column on how
to change or how to flash a custom
kernel so with that said let's go ahead
and set this at 1200 and next thing I
want to go over is the scaling governors
you've got an option typically from four
major ones and depending on your kernel
you have more options or less but the
four ones that you tend to see most
often are on-demand Power Save
conservative and performance you can see
mine set on conservative because this
one will go between your minimum and
maximum clock speeds but gradually go up
to the maximum as you put more of a load
on the processor the on-demand one works
in a similar way except for it doesn't
gradually go up it just goes straight to
the maximum performance pretty much like
the name says it stays at the maximum
the whole time so for in this case for
my phone would be at 1200 no matter what
whether I'm reading an article or I'm
running a 3d game and the Power Save is
the opposite of performance it'll run at
the minimum clock at all times and this
is mainly like the name says to save
power like I said I choose conservative
because you get a balance of performance
and battery life with this one so you
can choose whatever one you like but so
when I use and I actually recommend it
and most developers seem to do the same
and right here you'll see that there's a
set on boot option I haven't checked but
when you're setting your clock speeds I
definitely recommend to uncheck this guy
and test it out for at least a day or
two especially when you're overclocking
because there's a chance that you might
overclock to an unstable speed where
your phone will start
freezing or acting up and you could
reset it and go back to normal when this
is unchecked but when it's checked it's
going to keep going back to that
unstable clock speed in there's a chance
you might not be able to get back into
this app to set it back to the normal
speeds and you'd have to do a hard reset
you know and that's definitely something
you'd want to avoid so definitely test
it out before you check this but once
you do check it because if you don't
check it every time you restart you'll
have to reset or redo this process of
you know setting the clock speeds you
want that's pretty much it for the main
screen and the next tab is the profiles
tab and from here you get a actually
create custom profiles that allow you to
set the clock speeds based off of
conditions so I'll go in it enable and
I'll show you what I mean so the profile
for example right now is selected on
chain are charging you can make it so
the phone while is being charged kid go
to a certain governor so let's say
performance and I can make the minimum
clock speed you know twelve hundred so
while it's charging or while the phone
is plugged in I can make it so the phone
will actually run at full performance
and that way if I'm using it I won't
have to worry about it going to a lower
clock clock speed and I'll get you know
the best performance there's a few
options you can do
there's charging or charging while
you're on a AC adapter the USB when the
screens off when the batteries uh you
know below a certain percentage and you
can set that percentage phone
temperature and time so there's a lot of
things you could actually tweak uh
through this tab I don't actually use
them because I don't really have a need
for it and my battery life is fine
without it but if you want more control
it's definitely something you should
explore last thing you'll see is the
priority right here when you set
multiple prior are multiple profiles you
want to set the priority so that way you
could tell the app which one's the most
important so let's say
if the battery is less than 30% you want
it to run on Power Save mode even if
it's on charge you're going to set that
profile up the battery less than 30% and
you want to make the priority a little
bit higher then the other one you set
where when it when it's on charge it
runs that full full capacity so that way
you know if you're on a 30% and you plug
it in it's going to actually charge your
phone rather than just supply enough
power to power the processor um that's
pretty much for this tab and the next
tab you'll see is the Advanced tab this
is just so you can change the sampling
rate which you know tells the governor's
when do grade up or down the processor
speed I don't like I said I don't use
this and most people actually don't use
this but it's definitely something you
could do if you want more control over
you know your what your processor is
doing and when it grades the up speed up
the info tab just gives you just that um
this info on your phone in your
processor like temperatures and things
like that and it allows you to do a few
tests to test your processor and your
clock speeds and then the about is just
telling you what version you have and a
cool little thing actually is it lets
you change the theme so if you want to
go to like let's do a BIOS you could
change the theme of the setcpu app so
now you can see it it looks like this so
it's pretty cool feature but that's just
just for fun but that's pretty much it
on the app if you have any other
questions just visit phonebook calm and
drop us a message or leave a comment on
this video this is David from phonebook
calm and thank you for watching and I
don't forget to visit phonebook comm for
more cellphone news reviews and how to's
and the full how-to on how to use setcpu
is also on for both calm thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
