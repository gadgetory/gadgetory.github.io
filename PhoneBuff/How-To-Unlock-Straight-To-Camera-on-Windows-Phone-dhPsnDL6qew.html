comm and today I'm be doing a video on
how to launch a camera straight from
your lockscreen
ever since the unveiling of Android 4.0
or Ice Cream Sandwich a lot of people
been talking about the ability to launch
a camera straight from the lockscreen
and people and wondering if they could
do it on Windows Phone the answer is yes
you can do it and you actually did
something even better than that and
that's launch the camera from the
standby screen or when the screen is off
I'll show you how to do both so go to
your home screen swipe over to the
Settings app and when you launch this
you'll go straight to the system
settings you're gonna need to go to the
application so swipe to the right and
scroll down until you find pictures and
camera right here so you can see I've
launched it let me zoom in so you guys
can see what settings I'm clicking on so
you want to make sure that the press and
hold camera button to wake up phone is
on so this is off that's on and at the
same time you want to make sure that
that prevent accidental camera launch
when the phone was locked is off again
they'll tell you if it's off or on right
there so I have this off and I have this
guy on go back to my home screen zoom
out so I'll go ahead and lock the phone
and bring the lock screen up and what
you can see is let me put something
underneath my for the case alright so
what you will see is that straight from
the lock screen
I've actually press and hold the camera
button right here and launch trained to
straight to my camera so that's how you
do it straight from the lock screen
whoops and if you want to do the same
thing from the stamp right screen or
when the screen is off you can do the
same thing you're just gonna get the
phone press and hold the camera button
and it'll launch you straight to the
camera so you're able to take a picture
in literally no time so it's a lot
faster than you know unlocking phone
scrolling over and clicking on camera
well that's pretty much it's a quick
