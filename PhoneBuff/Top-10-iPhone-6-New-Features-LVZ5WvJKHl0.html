almost a year of rumors and speculation
the iPhone 6 and now the larger iPhone
six-plus are finally here Apple took the
wraps off the new devices a few days ago
and in that time I've had a chance to
really let it all sink in and I've come
up with the top 10 best new features
that both these iPhones bring to the
table but before we get into them I want

support the channel at the same time
alright let's get right into it top
feature number one display so the big
story everyone is talking about is that
Apple finally made an iPhone with the
bigger screen in fact they actually made
to the 4.7 inch iPhone 6 and even bigger
5.5 inch iPhone 6 plus but Apple making
the iPhone screen bigger isn't the whole
story as they also made the screen a
hell of a lot better as well both the
iPhone 6 and the 6 plus have higher
resolution displays in the 5s with the
iPhone 6 getting just enough of a bump
and resolution to retain that same 326
PPI or Retina mark across this larger
screen the iPhone 6 plus is getting full
HD 1080p resolution pushing its pixel
density all the way up to 401 in
addition to increasing the resolution
and sharpness Apple also boosted the
contrast ratios in their displays which
will give you wider whites and deeper
blacks finally with what Apple is
calling photo alignment the new iPhone
display should have more accurate and
Widing viewing angles in all making the
iPhone 6 the screen among the best in
the market to one-handed use the iPhone
has always been one of the easiest
phones to use with one hand however
because these new iPhones have bigger
displays one-handed use is obviously
going to take a hit
so in order to help reduce this Apple
has introduced a new feature called
reach ability essentially what this
feature does is move the top half of the
screen down to the bottom half making
anything that would otherwise be
difficult to reach easily reachable the
feature is activated with just a simple
DoubleTap of the home button and looks
to be a great option for one-handed use
especially when these sliding gestures
like the ones in Safari aren't available
3 design the iPhone 6 with its all-new
anodized aluminum build easily fits the
mold of what a premium flash of
smartphone should look like but we no
longer have the chamfered edges of the
iPhone 5 and 5s the back of the iPhone 6
curves over to the sides of the phone
and the cover glass on the front
actually curves down meeting those sides
giving the iPhone 6 a totally seamless
design combine that with the insanely
thin 6.9 and 7.1 millimeter thickness
and the iPhone 6 and 6-plus not only
look great but their design should also
help make them a little bit easier to
hold in the hand poor health the iPhone
6 is looking to take your health game to
the next level with the new m8 motion
coprocessor and the built in barometer
while the iPhone 5s had the m7
coprocessor and barometers are
technically nothing new in the world of
smart phones together with iOS 8 s
health app the iPhone 6 will be able to
track how many steps you've taken
determine whether or not those steps
were going up or down hill thanks to the
barometer and calculate with more
accuracy how many calories you've
actually burned throughout the day as a
result top feature number 5 speed so as
is expected with every new generation
the iPhone 6 has Apple's newest
processor in the a8 which Apple claims
to have a 25% faster CPU and 50% faster
graphics compared to the a7 found on the
iPhone 5s but what might be even more
interesting as the Apple claims the a8
is more efficient meaning it'll be able
to fire on all cylinders for a longer
period of time before the processor has
to slow itself down to prevent
overheating this should translate into
faster and more consistent multitasking
and gaming and one hell of a contender
in the phone book style speeds as we do
here in the channel but enough about the
a8 because the new processor isn't the
only way the iPhone 6 is faster with 802
11 AC Wi-Fi Wi-Fi speeds on the new 6
and 6-plus can be up to three times
faster than those in the
vests add to that up to 50% faster LTE
and the iPhone 6 looks to be an absolute
beast when it comes to performance 6
battery with a bigger phone comes a
bigger battery so despite the fact that
the new iPhones have a faster processor
and also have bigger displays of power
they still have an equal or greater
amount of battery life in every metric
compared to the iPhone 5s the iPhone 6
offers an average of 18% better battery
life than the 5s while the iPhone 6 plus
offers an average of a whopping 73%
better battery life which considering
how thin these devices are is pretty
damn impressive 7 camera iphone have
always had really good cameras on them
and the iPhone 6 isn't going to be an
exception with its all-new sensor and
autofocus system the iPhone 6 now offers
twice the autofocus speeds compared to
the 5s meaning your pictures and videos
will be much less likely to be out of
focus the all-new sensor also offers
twice the 1080p video frame rate at up
to 60 frames per second and maybe more
impressively twice the super slow motion
at 240 FPS which is just insane if you
end up opting for the iPhone 6 plus over
the regular 6 you'll also get optical
image stabilization which will help
reduce motion blur due to shaky hands
and because the exposure times can be
longer with OAS these six plus should
also perform a little bit better in
low-light conditions on top of all the
rear camera improvements both of the new
iPhones front cameras have also been
improved with a new burst mode so you
can all but guarantee that you'll
capture those Kodak moment selfies eight
Apple pay so the iPhone 6 now has NFC
which just like the barometer is nothing
new to the world of smartphones but
Apple didn't just slap NFC on there and
call it a day they also introduced what
they're calling Apple pay and
essentially what it is is a better and
more secure version of Google Wallet
that lets you make payments at over
220,000 stores and Counting right from
your phone every payment is password
protected by your touch ID fingerprint
and your actual credit card number is
never shared with Apple or any merchants
and instead a unique device account
number and transaction specific security
codes are created to help keep things a
little bit more private so there's
technically less of a chance of your
information getting stolen when using
the iPhone compared to using a physical
credit card this security element
alongside the convenience factor of not
having to bust out your wallet every
time may just be enough to make the
iPhone 6 and Apple pay the beginning of
a payment revolution 9 storage options
when it comes to their different storage
options there's really just two things
to note one there's now a new 128
gigabyte model available compared to the
Mac 64 gigabyte model on the iPhone 5s
and to the 64 gigabyte iPhone 6
now comes at the same price point that
the 32 gigabyte model came in last year
in other words for just $100 more you
can upgrade from the 16 gigabyte I phone
6 to the 64gb iPhone 6 which represents
a much better value in terms of storage
compared to what was available last year
or any year before that
ok we're finally there top reason number
10 iOS 8 so when the iPhone 6 officially
launches it'll come with iOS 8
pre-installed now there are a bunch of
great new features in iOS 8 that go way
beyond the scope of this video but the
reason why I've listed iOS 8 here is
combined with all the hardware features
that I just listed Apple seems to
finally be giving us what we've been
asking for for so long
I mean we've been asking for a bigger
screen since pretty much Andrea started
becoming popular in now we finally got
one we wanted third-party keyboards and
widgets and now we finally get that to
NFC check optical image stabilization
check again I guess what I'm trying to
say is that the iPhone 6 and 6 plus are
the biggest leaves the iPhone has ever
made and at least to me are the most
compelling iPhones ever but what do you
guys think is the iPhone 6
compelling enough for you to go out and
actually buy one and if so will you get
these 6 or these 6 plus let me know down
in the comments below but other than
that that's it for me in this video if
you liked it please give it a big thumbs
up to show your love and subscribe to
the channel for more iPhone 6 coverage
just like this thank you for watching
and I'll see you guys in the very next
