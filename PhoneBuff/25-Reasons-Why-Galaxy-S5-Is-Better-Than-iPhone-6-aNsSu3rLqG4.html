back to this form of style comparison
between these Samsung Galaxy s5 in the
Apple iPhone 6 so if you would subscribe
to the channel for long enough you know
that we do things a little bit
differently here at bulb up and instead
of your typical comparison we do it
phonebook style where we do two videos
looking at a bunch of reasons why each
smartphone can be considered better than
the other so that way after watching
both videos you can decide for yourself
which smartphone is the better
smartphone for you let's go ahead and
get right into it
reason number one Apple finally bumped
up the screen size with the iPhone 6 but
the galaxy s5 screen is still bigger at
5.1 inches and offers a higher
resolution and pixel density at 432 PPI
too while both phones offer bright
displays the s5 screen can become
significantly dimmer making it easier on
the eyes while using it in the dark
and acting as somewhat of a privacy
screen that only you can see when out in
public 3 another benefit of the s5
screen is that you can use it even when
you're wearing gloves which can be a
pretty big deal if you live in a colder
climate for yet another trick the s5
display has up its sleeve is air view
which gives you a preview of what your
finger is hovering over without actually
having to press it making it especially
useful for things like figuring out who
speed L is who's in the dollar reason
number five unlike the iPhone 6 the
Galaxy s5 is ip67 certified meaning is
both dust and water resistant which can
be useful not only in the times when you
accidentally get the phone wet but also
for when you do it on purpose like when
you're washing dishes and need to answer
a call 6 like it or not on the iPhone
you're stuck with the homescreen that
Apple gives you whereas on the galaxy s5
if you don't like the way something
looks you can easily change it with a
third-party launcher 7 and in addition
to being able to customize the
homescreen the s5 also allows you to
customize the lockscreen giving you even
more control over how your phone looks
and feels 8 while the iPhone 6 finally
comes with NFC it's limited only to
mobile payments whereas on the galaxy s5
not only can you make payments but you
can also use NFC for things like pairing
devices easy file transfer and
automating the things that you do on a
daily basis with NFC
tags 9 while the photo quality of the
Galaxy s5 and iPhone 6 are comparable a
big advantage the s5s camera has over
the iPhones it's its ability to record
video in 4k giving you four times the
resolution and sharpness of the iPhone 6
is 1080p reason number 10 while
recording video and 4k is great it does
create larger video files so thankfully
Samsung equipped the galaxy s5 with a
micro SD card slot allowing you to store
up to an additional 128 gigabytes of
video or whatever else you want via a
relatively inexpensive micro SD card 11
with private mode on the galaxy s5 you
can hide just about any file on your
phone like a picture or video for
example with it only being visible to
you when the password-protected private
mode is enabled 12 if you ever run into
trouble with the s5 you can triple tap
the power button to automatically send a
text to the people on your emergency
contact list giving them your location a
picture from the front and rear cameras
and a short sound recording so that way
they can get a better idea of where you
are and what's actually happening to you
13 with the toolbox feature on the
Galaxy S 5 you can have a persistent
floating menu on the screen wherever you
go giving you quick and easy access to
up to five customizable apps making
multitasking between them a breeze 14
speaking of multitasking on the galaxy
s5 you can actually put the bigger
screen to good use with multi window
which lets you use two apps on the
screen at the same time for the ultimate
multitasking experience reason number 15
unlike the iPhone 6 the Galaxy s5s
battery is removable meaning you can
swap it out with a freshly charged spare
or even get an extended battery if you
so desire 16 but there's a good chance
you won't even need to do that as the
Galaxy s5s 20 800 million battery will
keep you going for longer than the
smaller 1810 milliamp battery found on
the iPhone 17 and as if those two
previous points weren't enough if you
really needed a squeeze more life out of
a single charge the galaxy s5 also has
an ultra power saving mode that helps
the battery last you up to an additional
24 hours on just a 10% charge 18 if you
have a missed notification on the iPhone
6 this is what you
see when the screen is off on the galaxy
s5 on the other hand you get this
blinking LED light letting me know of
missed notifications without having to
turn the screen on in order to check 19
while the iPhone 6s App Store has
advantages of its own that you'll hear
about in the other video the Play Store
in the galaxy s5 has the advantage of
offering a two-hour return policy for
paid apps so that way you won't ever get
stuck paying for an app that you don't
end up wanting reason number 20 sure the
iPhone 6 can copy-and-paste
but with the galaxy s5s clipboard
feature you can keep up to 20 pieces of
text and images copied to the clipboard
letting you paste any one of them at any
given time 21 unlike the iPhone 6 the
galaxy s5 has an IR blaster which lets
you use your phone as a remote control
for things like your TV sound system
blu-ray player and if compatible even
your air conditioner 22 when you buy the
galaxy s5 you get over $500 worth of
freebies or what Samsung likes to call
galaxy gifts which includes things like
50 gigabytes of Dropbox three months of
LinkedIn premium and many other freebies
and specials available exclusively for
owners of the galaxy s5 23 the galaxy s5
lets you set default applications which
can be useful for when you want a third
party app to replace a system app for
example if you want to Skype to be used
to make calls when tapping on a phone
number from an email you can set Skype
as default over the dialer on the s5
whereas on the iPhone 6 you have to copy
the number down and open up the Skype
app separately 24 while you can
technically get Google now on the iPhone
6 the Galaxy s5s version of it is much
better integrated allowing you to do
things like say ok Google from any
screen and have Google now launch
automatically
alright reason number 25 the Galaxy s5
has USB OTG support which lets you
easily connect things like a mouse a
keyboard a USB flash drive in even an
Xbox controller to the phone with a
relatively cheap OTG cable so there you
have it those are my top 25 reasons why
the Galaxy s5 could be considered better
than the iPhone 6 of course the word
better is subjective so if you haven't
already I'd also check out the iPhone 6s
version of
this video which will be annotated
somewhere here on the screen or link for
you down below in the description
anyways that's it for me in this video
if you liked it please give it a big
thumbs up to show you love thank you for
watching it as always I'll see you guys
in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
