bluff and welcome back to part two this
two-part video series comparing the
Apple iPhone 5s and the samsung galaxy
s4
last time we looked at reasons why the
galaxy s4 can be considered better but
this time around is the iPhone 5s is
time to shine with 25 reasons of its own
on why it could be considered better
than the galaxy s4 if you haven't seen
the other video just yet you can find
the link right below that like button
but with that said let's go ahead and
get right into it
reason number one with this anodized
aluminum body chamfered edges and
sapphire crystal home button the iPhone
5s has a much more premium look and feel
to it in the plastic your polycarbonate
material is used on the galaxy s4 to the
retina display on the iPhone 5s offers
slightly more accurate colors and is
significantly brighter than the screen
on the galaxy s4 which helps make
visibility under direct light like when
you're outdoors for example much better
on the iPhone 5s than it is on the s4 3
thanks to its thinner lighter and more
compact design the iPhone 5s is easier
to use single-handed with all four
corners of the screen being easily
accessible even by those with smaller
than average hands for on the galaxy s4
you'd be hard-pressed to find any of
apple's apps on it but on the iPhone 5s
not only do you get all of Apple's
ecosystem you also get a good chunk of
Google's with apps like Google now
chrome Gmail maps and more all available
so you kind of get the best of both
worlds reason number 5 unlike the galaxy
s4 the iPhone 5s quickly receives
software updates just about as soon as
they become available
whereas on the s4 it can take weeks or
even months before you see an update
after it's released 6 the dedicated
vibrate switch on the iPhone 5s lets you
conveniently silence the phone without
having to turn the screen on the switch
also acts as a visual indicator so you
can tell if it's silent or not which can
help you avoid those embarrassing
moments when your phone rings when you
don't want it to 7 the iPhone 5s has a
fingerprint scanner which can be used
like your phone and can also act as a
password for things like downloading
apps while the s4 has unique lock
methods of its own the fingerprint
scanner on the iPhone 5s is much more
practical than any of them as it adds no
extra time to the process of unlocking
the phone while also maintaining a
certain level of security 8 the camera
on the iPhone 5s has a slow motion mode
which captures split
at 120 frames per second in
high-definition after you're done
recording a clip you can edit it and
slow down at just the right times to
make some really epic videos 9 while the
Galaxy s4 also has a burst shot mode the
iPhone 5s is works faster and lasts much
longer so you can almost guarantee that
you'll capture that Kodak moment reason
number 10 speaking of the camera on the
back of the iPhone 5s there is not one
but two LED flashes which work together
to give you better and more
natural-looking light when taking photos
11 the charging port on the iPhone 5s is
reversible which doesn't seem like that
big of a deal but if you've ever
struggled plugging in your phone at
night after turning off lights you'll
really appreciate this feature since it
makes things so much easier twelve the
battery life on the galaxy s4 and the
iPhone 5s are roughly the same but
because the iPhone 5s this battery has a
smaller capacity it's able to get fully
charged a lot faster than the s4 which
can be important when you're on the go
and only have a few minutes to let it
sit in charge 13 sure the galaxy s4 has
NFC but the iPhone 5s has airdrop which
not only is more convenient to share
files with it's also a lot faster at
doing it and can be used with multiple
people at once 14 on the iPhone 5s you
can easily see which apps have access to
what under the privacy settings if an
app has access to something that you're
not quite comfortable with you can just
switch it off without having to delete
the app entirely like you would on the
s4 reason number 15 with guided access
on the iPhone 5s you can hand your phone
to someone like your kid for example and
lock them into whatever app you want
without having to worry about them
getting into your personal information
16 speaking of kids if you're looking to
buy the iPhone 5s for one you can
restrict certain apps and even set
content guidelines so you don't have to
worry about them downloading anything
that isn't age-appropriate 17 if history
is any indicator the iPhone 5s will have
a better resale value down the line
compared to the galaxy s4 which means
that you'll get more cash back in a year
or two when you upgrade to another phone
18 unlike the Galaxy is for the iPhone
5s doesn't come pre-loaded with carrier
apps or blower installed that you may
not want or use 19 from just about
anywhere you can copy and paste on the
iPhone 5s you have the option to have
selected text read back to you which can
be useful when you're reading long
articles or
when you don't have time to look away
from what you're currently doing while
will save this Siri verse Google now
argument for another video
reason number 28 iPhone 5s is better
than the Galaxy s4 is the fact that you
can access the voices system by holding
the home button down even when the
screen is off 21
just like on the Galaxy s4 you can
access the camera from the iPhone 5s
lock screen but the difference here is
that you can access the camera even when
you have a password enabled unlike on
the galaxy s4 22 whether you're looking
at a stock app like contacts or settings
or if you're on the third party app like
Facebook or Instagram you can easily
scroll to the top of whatever page or
list you're looking at by tapping the
top of the screen on the iPhone 5s 23 if
you try to send a video file over 25
megabytes in size via email on the
Galaxy s4
you'll be met with this error on the
iPhone 5s you see no such error as the
phone automatically compresses the video
and just works seamlessly
24 while the iPhones app store no longer
has a significant edge in the total
number of apps available the quality of
its app selection with plenty of iOS
exclusives and iOS first apps landing
every year is still better than what's
available on the galaxy s4 Play Store in
fact in many cases when an app is
available on both platforms the iOS
version is better than its Android
counterpart reason number 25 as we
demonstrated in our speed test the
iPhone 5s with a 64-bit a7 processor
loaded both apps and web pages faster
than the Galaxy s4 and from our
experience with the two devices it just
runs a little bit smoother in general as
well alright guys those are my top 25
reasons on why the iPhone 5s could be
considered better than the galaxy s4
