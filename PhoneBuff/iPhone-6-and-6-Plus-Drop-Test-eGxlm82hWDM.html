the iphone 6 and 6 plus are finally here
this year with an all-new design that's
both bigger and thinner which begs the
question how do these new iPhones stack
up when being dropped well that's
exactly we're going to find out today in
this video when we drop each of these
phones once on their back once on its
side and then finally once on its face
to see just how durable apple's latest
devices up alright so we're going to
start off with the iPhone 6 on its back
note that we are using this platform
here with bubble level installed to help
ensure more accurate and more consistent
drugs so we drop it
and one two three
all right so you can see very minimal
damage I mean really nothing at all I
mean just a little scuff right here
maybe at the bottom but other than that
it bared very very well so that's
definitely a pass I so same drop now for
the iPhone 6 plus and one two three
again very very minimal damage got some
Scotch right over here at the top but
nothing that you'd really noticed so
overall once again it's a pass alright
so those back drop tests are relatively
easy so let's take it to the next level
and drop it on its side so you'll be
using our platform once again to make
sure we get the most accurate drop
possible 1 2 3
so let's take a look at the damage so we
get a little scuff right over here and
then along the bottom just a little bit
of scratches nothing really too bad no
dents or anything like that and again
really really good drop for the iPhone 6
let's go ahead and move on to the 6 plus
alright so the iPhone 6 did relatively
well for that side drop test it's going
to see how these 6 plus does go ahead
and line them up one more time 1 2 3
oh that is not good news you can see
that the screen is shattered we're going
to test it to see if it still works so
it still is functioning not sure if you
guys can see that on video but
definitely has a shattered screen and uh
along the bottom edge actually can see
some cracking right over here looks like
the screen is actually coming apart from
the body so pretty significant damage I
did land pretty cleanly on the side so
that one would have to be a bail all
right so the six-plus did get
significant damage on that side test but
the show must go on so we'll go ahead
and drop the iPhone 6 now on its front
to see how it fares so once again we're
going to line it up with our bubble
level in platform one two three
whoo and there you have it once again
crack screen looks like it's actually
coming apart once again so both iPhones
will they take some damage on the screen
it seems like they kind of comes apart
from that you know seamless design so
definitely you'll fail to see the screen
works and surprisingly enough it does
work and not sure if you can see it on
video but it is working it seems to be
fully functional actually but of course
if I want to use it as my thing
all right so the iPhone 6 plus already
technically failed the drop test but
like I said the show must go on the
screen isn't as badly cracked as the e6
or the iPhone 6 is now so we got to drop
the 6 plus on its face and 1 2 3
so uh when you first take a look at it
it doesn't seem like a sustained too
much damage compared to that first drop
I see something right over here so let's
see the screen actually works and once
again the screen is still working so the
display itself is relatively strong but
the glass in the front of course is
going to shatters but it didn't
relatively well on the face drop that's
considering it already had damage before
alright guys there you have it that is
the drop test for the iPhone 6 or 6 plus
that is it for me in this video if you
guys enjoyed make sure to give it a big
thumbs up subscribe the channel for more
iPhone 6 coverage just like this and as
