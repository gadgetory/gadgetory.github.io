this is the brand new HTC one its HTC
successor to last year's HTC One and it
has these same great aluminum build
quality that we've known to common love
makes you see but this year's model is a
little bit more slippery which probably
means that there's gonna be a lot more
people droppin it so that means we're
gonna be doing a drop to see just how
durable the phone is when we doing a
standard drops when we drop it once on
the back once on its side and of course
once on its face to see just how durable
the phone is alright let's get started
so the first drop test is going to be on
its back I'm gonna be dropping it as
flat as I can so that way we get a nice
good drop one two three
alright so it looks like the phone took
quite a bit of damage it has some
scratches and pretty deep ones actually
right here along the edges along the
bottom left a little bit more some more
on the top left and that the worst of it
seems to be right here on the top right
the screen itself is perfect actually
the whole front of the device seems to
be working perfectly fine so let's go to
the next drop test alright so it did
pretty good on the back drop test when
we doing a more extreme drops as now on
the side so we'll drop it in one two
three alright so as you can see there's
a little bit more damage along the
bottom of the HTC One I didn't really
get too much damage anywhere else of
course the front is still fine and the
screen is working perfectly fine but I
will see if that remains with the next
drop test alright so so far so good we
do have some pretty bad scuffs along the
edges but other than that can't really
complain the biggest drop test is the
one we're about to do right now we're
going to drop it straight on its front
and see how it fares so one two woohoo
that sounded bad alright so as you can
see it did suffer a pretty bad drop
right on its face
we do have cracking along the bottom
left all the way up to the top left the
top right of the screen seems to be okay
and the screen is actually still
functional which is a good sign but it
is definitely shattered in if you run
your finger across this you could
definitely cut yourself so how to say
that's a fail as far as that drop test
goes all right so that does it for me in
this drop test of the HTC One overall I
give it an OK score I mean the body
itself besides the scuffing along the
edges did pretty well because there is
no dents which typically some devices do
get dented and let us go to show you how
strong that aluminium build is of course
the front of the screen is still glass
or did shatter it's usable which is
definitely a plus but of course you
might cut your finger if you do so so I
wouldn't recommend that
but because the phone is still working
and it's still in relatively good shape
as far as the body goes we'll be taking
it to the next level to see just how
much damage the HTC One can take before
it cracks and I mean that literally so
stay tuned to the channel subscribe if
you haven't already and if you liked the
video hit that thumbs up button to show
your support alright guys I'll see you
guys in the very next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
