and in this video I'm going to be
benchmarking the brand new samsung
galaxy s4 we're here in New York City
for the unpacked event and first
benchmark outrun here is actually gonna
be quadrant and while this thing is
running I'll let you guys know that the
galaxy s4 are at least this version of
it is running a 1.8 giga hertz samsung
exynos 5 octa processor that's eight
cores and of course it has two gigabytes
of RAM which is pretty much the standard
nowadays on the high end android devices
and it's running on android 4.2 point2
so go ahead and finish up this benchmark
and you see a score of 11,000 782 so
obviously blows everything out of the
water as far as this benchmark goes at
least the devices are showing now how it
compares to newer devices coming out
with different processors we'll see but
pretty impressive we'll go ahead and go
to the next benchmark which is going to
be the n 10 to benchmark and I'll just
kind of skip through the process here so
that way you guys could actually see the
end result which is probably what you
guys are looking for anyway so this
final score on antutu is 20,000 105 so
again a really impressive score and you
know the obviously this is just a
benchmark and it's not going to be a you
know Bo and all for you know performance
tests but it is a good indicator and
from my use it seems like the galaxy s4
is really really fast i mean the galaxy
s3 is fast to begin with so you're not
really going to notice you know any lag
at all pretty much ever on the galaxy s4
at least from what we've seen obviously
we had to test it you know more
extensively before we can have a final
say but final benchmark here is the
Vilano benchmark and as you can see it
scored a 2076 in the HTML chapter and
824 in the metal chapter which again are
pretty impressive benchmarks and
definitely you know lives up to what you
would expect from that a core processors
but that's pretty much it for me and
this video as far as the benchmarking
goes of course going to be doing a whole
bunch more of coverage on the galaxy s4
make sure you subscribe to their channel
if you haven't already and as always
thank you for watching video and I'd
appreciate a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
