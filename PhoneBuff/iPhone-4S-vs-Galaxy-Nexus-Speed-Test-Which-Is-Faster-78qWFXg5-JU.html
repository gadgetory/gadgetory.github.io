both calm and today I'm going to be
comparing some apps on the iphone 4s and
the Galaxy Nexus see which one loads up
faster so i have google earth movies by
flixster photoshop express and
dictionary com I know that the operating
sister different obviously and the apps
are written differently but just for
comparative sake we'll just load each
one up at the same time and see how they
fare on each device so first up will do
movies and before I do that I want to
show you that there is no apps running
in the background on either device so
we're going to get a nice even
comparison test right here so we'll go
ahead and load up movies and looks like
they loaded up about the same time the
iphone 4s showed the application first
but as far as populating with all the
movies they're really close right there
you be the judge of that one and let's
do Photoshop Express next so the iphones
a lot faster in this case galaxy nexus
just finished right now will do
dictionary com and looks like they
opened up just about the same time that
once again tough to call and our last
but not least we'll do Google Earth so
it looks like the iphone 4s beat it to
it so I'm overall I'd say that the
iphone 4s is apps seem to load a little
bit faster that could be because the
apps are more optimized for it and maybe
the apps aren't yet optimized for ice
cream sandwich but that's the results
that we've done all right thank you for
watching the video this is David
phonebook calm and don't forget to visit
bumblefuck humph more cell phone news
reviews and how to's thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
