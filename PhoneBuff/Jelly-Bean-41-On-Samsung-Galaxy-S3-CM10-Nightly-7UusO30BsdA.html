this one I'm gonna show you Android
4.1.1 jelly bean running on my samsung
galaxy s3 this is actually the t-mobile
variant of the s3 and I'm gonna be
running it with the CM 10 nightly build
for this particular phone see M stands
for CyanogenMod just case you didn't
know considering the fact that it is a
nightly build it does mean that there
are some issues here and there it's not
quite yet a finished product but those
will be addressed until as soon as I it
is an official ROM I'll go ahead and
power this guy on for the meantime show
you guys how the boot up animation looks
so you saw a quick little Samsung splash
screen then we see the galaxy s3 splash
screen right over here like you would
normally on the stock you know 4.0.4
with TouchWiz but of course now we have
the Santa Jen mod boot up animation
which looks really really nice by the
way I definitely like it you know looks
nice and clean boot up time is
relatively quick on this ROM you can see
it's already done loading and we'll go
ahead and go into the settings first
thing so if you guys kids verified that
it is running android 4.1.1 so go to
about phone android version 4.1.10 jelly
bean easter egg and you know look these
guys around like you would on the Galaxy
Nexus with that stock jelly bean ROM hit
home and takes you right to the home
screen really really fast I mean pretty
much you know what jelly beans really
really fast on the Galaxy Nexus with
this 1.2 gigahertz or one gig of ram you
can only imagine how fast it is on a 1.5
gigahertz Snapdragon s4 with two guys
around mean this thing just flies pretty
much everything you do opens up you know
instantly and keep in mind you know all
these apps haven't been open yet so
they're not opening the background
they're just flying through really
really nice performance I'll go ahead
and show you the preinstalled
applications that come with TM 10 so
first thing you'll notice is Apollo here
at the top left this is basically like
Google music in a sense but the
difference is it actually gets your
album art which is pretty cool the
reason why I say it's like Google Music
is because when you actually play a song
so I'll go ahead and play a song really
quick and
the volume down really quick and we'll
go to the now plane you see it looks a
lot like google music of course you know
in a notification bar it looks just
about the same as you would see with
Google music so I'll go ahead and back
out of there that's pretty cool we'll go
ahead and go to the DSP manager knob
this basically allows you to enable
audio hacks like boosting the bass I
could do this for the Bluetooth for the
regular speaker and the headset of
course you have the equalizer here and
you could you know adjust this however
you like go ahead and hit cancel for now
going on quadrant here I installed
myself wrong manager I installed myself
as well do flash this thing in the first
place and the other app that you'll see
is torch basically just a little
flashlight pretty cool we can do strobe
mode and a high brightness doesn't seem
to work on the galaxy s3 I mean gives
you a warning except and it doesn't
actually turn on a flashlight so I just
leave it off and it works but anyway
those are the pre-installed apps Google
apps were actually not installed so for
example Google now even Gmail and things
like that were installed with the ROM
alone you had a flash hold separately so
I went ahead and did that I mean I can't
imagine why somebody wouldn't but I went
ahead and did that and Google now works
I'll go in and show you how that works
really quick who is the President of the
United States of America
hey I turned the volume up so it
actually will display it so didn't work
there for some reason
try it again say up how tall is Michael
Jordan so six six so you guys see it
works just like it does on the Galaxy
Nexus with that stock jellybean ROM so
it works really well we'll go ahead and
try another one remind me to walk the
dog in 15 minutes so setting alarm etc
so pretty cool
of course that's probably the main
reason why I wanted to get jellybean so
bad on my phone other than the speed
performance enhancements like with our
project butter but we'll go ahead and go
on to the next thing we'll go into the
actual settings now so let's go to menu
we'll go to settings and let's look at
you know what's different on this ROM
compared to our stock jellybean ROM so
up here over the wireless and networks
it's pretty much the same so I'm not
gonna go over that but you can see right
here it says interface so this allows
you to change the user interface from
the launcher so though from the launcher
go to your home screen change all these
different options in their home screen
for example let's say you don't want it
to say camera right there right that
little label you can go into the
settings and go to launcher and then
home screen and you go down to hide icon
labels enable it and boom it's gone so
that's a pretty cool little future well
go ahead and go back and show you a few
more you could disable the search bar so
if you don't want that Google now search
bar to show you can disable that so very
customizable I mean that's really what
you know rooting your phone and flashing
custom roms are all about you get a
whole bunch of options here this is the
launcher you know go to the drawer app
drawer you get more options generally
you know you can do the auto screen
rotate so that way even your home screen
can rotate like that so that's pretty
cool we'll go on to the next section
whoops went to the phone app go to the
next section which is the lock screen so
tap on lock screen of course you have
your screen security regular screen lock
with a face and lock and all that good
stuff
but you also could do things like
delaying and scrub the screen lock you
can press the menu button to unlock the
screen so instead of having to unlock
like that you could just tap menu which
you know if you're not that big on
security I mean you just want it to not
pocket al that might be a good option
for you some other options there whether
you can see is enabled so what that
means is when you go to the lock screen
or actually give you the weather see if
it's actually working right now so yeah
as you can see Laguna Hills 80 degrees
pretty cool nice clean look to it to
this wallpaper by the way is a cm10
wallpaper so imma go ahead and press and
hold on the home screen you see this
CyanogenMod wallpapers and there's an
option for no wallpaper so it's just a
black wallpaper basically but I'm gonna
go ahead and go over here and show you
some of the ones that come on here so
pretty nice little options of wallpapers
as you can see some nice images here and
pretty much the same you know
CyanogenMod so I'm just gonna go ahead
and stick with this one I'll go back to
the settings so while I'm here let's
show you the notification bar so if you
notice right now the screen kind of just
stuff flickered a little that's one of
the bugs currently with this version of
the ROM of course that can be fixed
tomorrow or the next you know nightly
brother comes out but that's something
to keep in mind notification bar you
have these this basically is power
that lets you have your Wireless toggles
right over here for Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS
this is actually my screen brightness
and I have a little flashlight toggle
which is pretty cool you can actually
customize what's on there to within the
settings so before I get into that those
finish this off
you see themes I don't have any themes I
just have the one that came on it so
that's that but on your system you can
go to the status bar and this is where
you can change things like the battery
percentage icon whether or not you want
it to show the clock and all the changes
are instant you don't that restart the
phone or anything like that again
battery you know status style but keep
it at percentage but you can make it a
regular icon or you just hide it all
together brightness control so for
example I want to make a brighter or
dimmer like that I could do it I'll go
ahead and disable that for right now
though and uh let's go to the
notification drawer because I said you
know the power widget so you can
customize what buttons actually show up
so you may go to sleep toggle 2g 3G
whole bunch of Wireless toggles over
here toggle the orientation bunch of
stuff like that so let's go ahead and
back out of here from now you can also
change the order so for example if I
wondered my flashlight to be over here I
could do that and you see it's
automatically reflected you know
instantaneously so really cool let's go
ahead and back out of here you could
also customize the wallpaper from here
but I'm not gonna do that font size of
course that's nothing really special
power mania so basically right now my
power menu I have power off the reboot
option and the regular ones that you see
with jellybean but want an option for
screenshot to show up there to I can do
that so it'll just take a screenshot of
wherever I am if you don't wanna press
that you know hold down and power button
if you keep messing up that's a cool
little thing that you can do a profile
switcher
so speaking of profiles go ahead and
show you what that is so before I jump
into a really quick bits go ahead and
show you the hardware keys basically you
customize what these keys do over here
by enabling them enabling the custom
actions and then like for example a long
press on the menu button I could have it
I can have it you know open up the voice
search for example so say I'm here and I
wanted to open instead of having the
press this all the time I just press and
hold this and boom it opens it up so
it's kind of cool to be able to have a
physical button to actually do that
functions go back into the settings
really quick and we'll go into where we
were settings when I was going to show
you the profile so profiles
I don't know if you guys are familiar
with HTC Sense basically you know what
HSN to get customized you know your
options with your whole phone with a
particular they call it scene well this
is kind of the same you know you could
choose whether or not what connections
you want to have you could choose you
know what volume is you want to set et
cetera all with the profile so for one
for default one for home one for night
one for when you're at work
pretty cool options here if you go to
application groups you could choose you
know what you want each particular
application to do go ahead and go out of
there though let's see what else is
different we have performance right over
here get a big old warning we're here
basically is like the setcpu app you
could change the processor of clock
speed etc so I could choose what kind of
governor it's using right now it's on
on-demand I could just a minimum and
maximum CPU frequency can't go higher
right now cuz I don't have a custom
kernel on here but if I did I might be
able to push that further set it on boot
so pretty cool to have that right there
I think I missed something there's an
Advanced tab right here this with a
whole bunch of Advanced Options over
here that you can you know mess with but
again those are advanced I'm not gonna
go into it that's pretty much it for the
settings let's go ahead and show you
what it looks like you know when you
actually receive a text message but
that's pretty cool alright so you can
see I got a text message and basically I
have a text message right here so this
is my screenshots gonna what get rid of
that guy really quick you see I have an
option not only to open it but I could
do a quick reply or call the number that
texts me so if I don't want to do a
quick reply opens up a little pop-up box
and I can reply right here instead of
having to actually go into the messaging
app which is pretty nice makes things a
little bit easier so I'll back out of
there what else what else is there oh
yeah the lockscreen right here you can
actually customize you know if you don't
want the camera say you don't use the
camera all that often or say you don't
want Google now from here you actually
customize that so I can go back in here
let's go back to the settings I thought
I'd cover everything but I knew is
missing something and you know with how
many features this ROM gives you it's
kind of you know hard not to so let me
find it really because under lockscreen
you go to slider shortcuts and basically
let's go up I could change it now from
being Google to you know let's say I
wanted to go directly to a contact or
direct dial which is cool if you call a
particular person a lot you have them
right from your lock screen swipe
to go to him instead of you know going
to Google now whatever how many cancel
cuz actually like Google now they're
another thing is you could have you know
your calendar display events on the lock
screen itself to so I don't think I have
any events my locks in my calendar and I
don't so anyway that is pretty much it
I'm going to run a quadrant test this in
case you guys want to see that wanna see
is just quadrant it doesn't really you
know I've ran a few home and doesn't
really make all that big of difference
but I want to let you guys see that so
I'll go ahead and skip through this
because this is boring to watch
all right so the benchmark is done you
see scored a 46:41 so not really higher
than you know which you would expect
sometimes actually might be even a
little bit lower honestly but honest as
quadrant I mean from the performance you
guys could see you don't need a
benchmark to show you that I mean
everything is really really fast cm10
you know this nightly bill is a great
way to have you know jellybean first of
all second of all that stock you know
Android experience on your Samsung
Galaxy I've been waiting for a long time
I can't wait till as you know it's
official what all the bug fixes are you
know done but in the meantime I'm
enjoying this a lot just wanted to make
this video guys for you guys so you guys
can see what it looks like if you don't
actually want to run to flash the you
know the nightly build on your phone cuz
you know sooner or later gonna want to
flash the next one so anyway that's
pretty much it for me in this video if
you found it helpful please hit the like
button it helps me out a lot and
subscribe to the channel if you haven't
already and I just want to give a big
thanks to the CM team and I left the
link in the description box below to the
