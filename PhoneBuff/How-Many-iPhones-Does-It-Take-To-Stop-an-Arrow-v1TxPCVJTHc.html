the making of this video
your discretion is advised what's up
guys david adjey here and welcome back
to yet another episode of vs. the show
where we work with professionals to do
extreme durability tests as you can see
today we're going to be stacking up a
whole bunch of iPhones I'm going to
shoot an arrow and see how many iPhones
it takes to actually stop the arrow with
us today is our sharpshooter then I'm
going to be shooting at the arrows
hopefully he can puncture all through
there gonna use a regular field test
arrow which is nice and compact so let's
go see what happens
these arrows do a lot more damage I give
him credit for us all
I imagine it will go through at least
three of them I'm putting my money on -
two - okay Price is Right you and go one
below you just want to save phones
that's why you know I know why I'm
nervous I'm just always nervous now
after what we've seen we've seen things
I've seen something
oh and another fire - it went through -
you know I think it's fine it's gonna
have its ups and we're out let it simmer
out how do we get - yeah wow you're
right
I I mean that tend to be I tend to be I
tend to be so the first ones running the
question is the second one gonna burn I
don't think it's gonna add - well you
look at the third one no hit three hit
three it a go oh yeah so I mean kind of
split know we sit through through three
through so what's with the different it
was two and a half two and a half two
and a half iPhones I'm just scared it's
gonna like explode in our face so don't
worry I'll do this do this even look if
you look at this one that phones no
longer gonna work actually I don't know
if you think this one's a good work I
don't know that's a pretty good I'm
gonna pull it out let's see if it's
gonna work no oh hell no no look at that
that's that it's not gonna work but we
still have two phones that we could call
each other from cool you can't pull that
one out there you go so we got we got
our iPhones covered but check this out
look at that front facing camera gone no
more selfies okay so look if we get a
close-up shot right here of the battery
so you see that's what's smoked up and
you see it's kind of puffed up it
expanded as it heated up like popcorn in
the microwave and luckily kept
everything else intact but I I guess the
best thing to do now look at the slo-mo
cam yeah let's check that out is music
oh look at all that glass look at the
camera just flying off I think that's
the front-facing camera oh my God look
at them all this rock back and forth
yeah always say all over town was it one
more time I like George Michael song
behind us
alright sex oh goodness grace
I phones well I see you see the screen
on the third one even came out almost
the same as the first two except we
didn't go all the way through I love how
it's wobbling - that's amazing
I love slow motion alright so there you
have it it takes two and a half i phones
to stop an arrow that was crazy but
anyway uh what do you think what do you
think I was really surprised on how
clean the impact was for both phones on
the slo-mo it was like watching a mirror
image both phones the damage-wise almost
look identical except for that phone but
this makes me very hungry for shitty
luck
yeah that shish kebab alright so that is
it for us in this video we actually have
more iPhones left so there could be more
