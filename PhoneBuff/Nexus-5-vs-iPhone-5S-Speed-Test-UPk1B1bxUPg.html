and in this video we're gonna be doing a
speed test with arguably the two fastest
phones in the world right now in the
Apple iPhone 5s on your left and the
Google Nexus 5 on your right now I'm not
going to be doing your typical
run-of-the-mill speed test here because
honestly doing the boot up app speed and
browser tests each one by one won't
really make more than a split second
difference in most cases so instead
we're gonna be switching it up a little
and run each phone as fast as we
possibly can through a virtual obstacle
course consisting of a bootable test and
twelve different apps and hopefully at
the end all those split second
differences will add up to a definitive
winner
so the Nexus 5 gets the early lead from
the boot up test and jump straight into
the first obstacle if you will and
starting up the stopwatch with the
iPhone 5s maybe a second or two behind
it so keep in mind that we are putting
both phones through the same exact
series of tests here waiting for each
phone to finish loading its tasks before
going on to the next test alright so it
looks like the iPhone 5s has caught up a
little with both phones loading up
Google Earth and as you can see the
Nexus 5 showed the earth first but there
is some stuttering going on whereas on
the iPhone 5s the animation is a lot
more smooth but either way it looks like
both phones are loading up the 3d model
about the same time so going in to the
score mobile tests they are
neck-and-neck and it looks like it's
going to stay that way at least with a
score mobile app because there is no
separation whatsoever
going into the Netflix app looks like
the iPhone 5s is maybe just a split
second ahead of the Nexus 5 and will lit
up this streaming video here to see
which one plays it first and as you can
see the iPhone 5s did end up loading it
up a little bit faster so it goes on to
the next step but right hot on his heels
is the Nexus 5 and looks like the Nexus
5 actually is really struggling with
this RDO app so I don't know what's
going on there maybe need some
optimization from the developer but
either way it is falling behind with the
iPhone 5s already on the browser tests
already loading the mobile vert site and
onto the full verge site whereas the
Nexus 5 is just now getting started with
the browser test and the iPhone 5s
pulling ahead going on to the social
media portion of this test where
it's actually struggling with the
Facebook app a little so we'll have to
see if the Nexus 5 could make a comeback
similar to what the iPhone 5s did
earlier in the video
so on the iPhone 5s you got the Google+
app loading up still waiting on that
verge website on the Nexus 5 going on to
Twitter is the iPhone 5s with the Nexus
5 just now starting with the social
media portion of this test so if it's
gonna make a comeback it's got to do it
now because the iPhone 5s is on the last
app loading up the most recent video
that I did on the channel and as you can
see the iPhone 5s did load up the videos
so it is just about done it took 1
minute and 58 seconds from when we first
started the stopwatch and as you can see
the Nexus 5 is still in the YouTube app
trying to load up that last video that I
uploaded and there you go finish loading
up the video and for some reason the
stopwatch stopped working when I opened
it up but for those of you who want to
know don't worry I got your back
it finished in 2 minutes and 15 seconds
alright guys that's pretty much it for
me in the speed test like I said in the
beginning you honestly won't notice the
difference between the two phones in
terms of speed unless you compare them
side-by-side like this and there are
much bigger differences to consider when
deciding on your next phone but these
type of videos are still fun to do so if
you liked it please give it a thumbs up
and subscribe to the channel for more
iPhone 5s and Nexus 5 coverage just like
this thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
