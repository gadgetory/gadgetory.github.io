and in this video we're gonna be
unboxing the blackberry z10 now this is
really BlackBerry's big push to get back
into the smartphone game so I'm really
interested to see you know how it's
gonna stack up and how its BlackBerry's
handle West is going to stack up against
the likes of Android iOS and even
Windows Phone so I'll be doing a whole
bunch of coverage the near future on
this device but for right now let's go
ahead and get into the unboxing and see
what blackberry included inside the box
alright so we'll start off this unboxing
by taking a look at the box itself first
as you can see on the front you have a
big old z10 logo and a BlackBerry logo
down there at the bottom on the back you
just get some legal jargon in a variety
of languages given that this is the
international model but what's
interesting here is the rim logo as you
may or may not know Rim technically
doesn't exist anymore the company
changes names of blackberry recently and
obviously it wasn't before they shipped
this product out so this very may well
be the last blackberry with the rim logo
on the box moving along on one side you
have your serial numbers and on the
other you just have a blackberry logo
which looks pretty nice on the top you
get some more blackberry branding and
then nothing at the bottom which means
we're ready to open up the box alright
so we'll go ahead and flip the box over
well cut through the piece of tape at
the bottom and flip it back pull off the
top cover and there you go you have the
blackberry z10 as you can see I got the
black version here which kind of blends
in with the box and they're just sliding
but it's very minimalistic design and no
buttons on the front and same thing on
the back the back just has the camera
and you have you know the little
blackberry logo in the center but we'll
go ahead and go over to the device in a
second but right now I want to show you
what's inside of the box itself so go
ahead and move this little phone holder
out of the way and I want to show you
guys so this is the international model
like I said before so you're gonna get
the international accessories now the
company I bought it from on Amazon which
I'll link to down in the description box
below was nice enough to include an
adapter you know for us us users but
anyways going further into the box you
get a whole bunch of documentation so
you know right here you have the safety
and product information and that you
haven't had a couple of different
languages and then you have your
QuickStart guides which you know go
ahead and
this guy up really quick to show you you
know what it looks like just basically
giving you idea of how to use your c10
and things like that how to get your
battery and so nothing really you know
crazy but going further into the box you
have some more documentation and I have
to say this is probably the most you
know documentation I've seen in a
smartphone or a tablet you know ever let
me know if you guys agree or disagree so
you have your headphones here which I'll
open up in just a second but first I
want to go further into the box so you
have your microUSB to USB cable here
which I'm sure you guys probably have a
dozen unless you're coming from a phone
like the iPhone but this one is kind of
nice it does have some blackberry
branding on it so you know that's a plus
if you want to use it but you know
typically I keep mine brand new in the
box just in case you know one one dies
or my dog screws it up I have a backup
now we'll go ahead and open up the
headphones headphones you know on here
aren't really high quality I wouldn't
say they do feel kind of plastic and
cheap but just like the USB cable does
have some blackberry branding on it
which is nice and you know at least they
included it and the last thing you have
in the Box is the 1800 million battery
so it's gonna be interesting to see how
this guy holds up but that's pretty much
it for the box let's go ahead and look
at the device so on the front of the z10
you have an earpiece at the very top a
two megapixel front-facing camera right
below it and then a 4.2 inch screen with
a resolution of 1280 by 768 giving you a
pixel density of 355 and then below that
touch screen you have a black way logo
and speaking of that logo you have one
again on the back at the very center and
this pretty much nothing else on the
back other than the eight megapixel
camera with LED flash that's capable of
1080p video on the right side of the z10
you have nothing but a volume rocker for
both volume up and down and in between
those volume buttons you actually have a
dedicated button for voice control on
the left side you have a micro USB
charging port as well as a micro HDMI
port for HDMI out which is something
we're not really used to seeing but you
know it's kind of nice to see that
Blackberry included that up on top
there's a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
a secondary mic and of course you have
your power button and finally at the
bottom you have nothing but your speaker
grille alright so with the hardware tore
out of the way I want to go ahead and
give you guys a quick sneak peek at the
software so first thing I want to point
out is that you actually unlock the
screen by swiping your finger up just
like that which is nice because
you don't really have to use that power
button all the time which you know isn't
all that easy to access anyway going
into the settings and under about you
can see that the phone is running on
blackberry 10 OS version 10.9 and to
back out of an application or to back go
back one step when you're in an
application what you do is you actually
tap that back button at the bottom left
and to exit out completely you swipe up
from the bottom which takes you to that
multitasking window where you could
actually close the apps out so go ahead
and click on photos over here and give
you a quick demo of the you know
fluidity of zooming in and out which you
can see it's nice and smooth I'll go
ahead and tap on edit which opens up the
photo editor and right here you can see
the multitask window just tapping those
X's closes the apps out swiping to the
left gives you the BlackBerry hub excuse
you all the notifications and stuff
going to the right is your app drawer
and now you can just see you know how
quick the OS is with this dual-core
Snapdragon processor everything is just
flying going into the notification bar
you can see you have Wireless toggles
for Bluetooth Wi-Fi alarm etc tapping on
any toggle will take you straight into
these settings where you know for
example here you could connect but I'm
gonna be going into much greater detail
on the BlackBerry z10 in future videos
so make sure you subscribe for that but
that is pretty much it for me in this
unboxing if you found it helpful or if
you liked it please give this video a
thumbs up it really helps me out a lot
