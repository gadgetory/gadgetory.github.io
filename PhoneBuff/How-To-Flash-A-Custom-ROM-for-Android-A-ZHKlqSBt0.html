from Falmouth comm and today I'll be
doing a video on how to flash a custom
ROM to your Android phone so first
things first you do need to be written
in order to be able to do this as you
can see I'm already rooted I have super
user permissions and second thing you
need is long manager which is available
for free on the Android Market so
download that guy and then launch it up
and the reason why you need this app is
because it allows you to flash
clockworkmod recovery instead of using
the stock recovery which this one allows
you to install is zip from the SD card
so that's we're going to install the rom
from so go ahead and tap flash
clockworkmod recovery it's going to ask
you to confirm which kind of phone you
have this case I have the samsung galaxy
s vibrant and as you can see it is
flashing the recovery hit allowing super
user requests and I exceeds that
successfully downloaded clockworkmod
recovery hit ok hit home and now you're
pretty much done with the app from here
so you're going to turn the phone off
sit power off and all is turning off
I'll show you how to boot into recovery
so what you're going to do is you're
going to press and hold the power button
and the volume down button
simultaneously so phone is an off yet
have to wait for it to vibrate but
you're gonna press these two guys
simultaneously and hold it until you see
the screen light up alright so the phone
is off now so I'm gonna go ahead and
press and hold the volume down button
and the power key simultaneously tell us
see the screen line up let go and it
should take us right into
clockworkmod recovery
all right so clockworkmod recovery is
loaded up and I'll let me zoom in so you
guys can see what I'm doing so when
you're navigating through the recovery
mode the touch screen actually doesn't
work so what in order to navigate you
need to press up and down on your volume
rocker to go up and down and to select
something you're going to press the
power button so before you do anything I
recommend doing the three wipes before
you install your ROM because if you
don't you might run into issues
so the first wipe is the factory reset
wipe data right here so I'm going to
press power it's going to give me a list
of a whole bunch of notes in one yes
you're going to hit that one yes and you
can see it did a factory reset the
second wipe is wipe cache partition same
thing go - yes wipe the cache and then
the third and last wipe that you want to
do is under advanced and it's wipe
dalvik cache so go to yes again and
there you go so I've done the three
wipes now I'm ready to install or flash
the ROM so you're going to go to install
zip from sd card and that you want to
put your the wrong you want to install
on your SD card before you even do any
of this and then go to choose zip from
sd card press the power button mine's at
the very bottom so it's a trigger 3.2
final I'm just going to tap the slight
button go down to yes to confirm that I
want to install it and there you go it's
going to be installing the ROM and you
want to let this go for a while it
should take somewhere between two to
five minutes depending on the phone and
the ROM but I shouldn't take too long
all right so you can see it's almost
done and I'll just skip to when it's
complete all right so the install from
sd card is complete as you can see so
install the rom and what you want to do
from here is go back and then hit reboot
system now so when I hit this it's going
to restart the phone and something
important to note is when your phone
loads up the screen where it looks like
it's ready for you to start using it
I'd recommend letting it sit for an
additional five to ten minutes because
sometimes a ROM will load things up in
the background and if you interfere with
the phone or started using it before
it's completely loaded I can lead to
some issues so let it sit for 10 to 15
minutes and then begin using it alright
that's it for me in this video this is
