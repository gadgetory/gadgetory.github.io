from pump up calm and today we'll be
doing a review on the high q-- mp3
recording app available from Google Play
so I have the Galaxy Nexus and I've had
a lot of issues with my voice recording
apps that I've used to use on some of my
older phones but for example I have this
voice recording app which is the most
popular one and for some reason every
time I record my voice it just sounds a
little bit muffled so I'll go ahead and
play it and hopefully you can listen to
it on camera and it comes through so it
play so of course while it works it's
it's just not clear and it sounds just a
bit muffled as if I was covering the
microphone which I was not so I'll go
ahead go ahead and go to high cue empty
recorder and um let's click on my voice
recording so I recorded both of these
files are both these sounds just before
I started this video and you know the
phone was in the same exact spot so
definitely we don't have to do anything
with that it's just how to do with how
well the quality or how good the quality
is on this app so this app lets you
record in a bit rate of up to 128
kilobytes per second which gives you the
best quality available on you can do
things such as change the gain to make
the sounds louder you can make it you
know two to four times louder and you
could also change the location of the
stored recordings um I just like to have
in my the recordings folder you could
choose to have the recordings added to
your music library and there's some
other options here such as single tap to
play and that's just so when I go over
to the list
I could play instead of before you so
default to this so that's what it like
what they have some of these I do wish
that the developer would add in is the
ability to delete uh multiple items at
once so right now you know you'd have to
delete one by one as you're trying to
clear them out which is kind of annoying
there's no other option really to go
around other than opening up a file
explorer
another app and deleting them all but
that's one thing I'd like to see another
thing I'd like to see is the ability to
when I record to be able to pause it by
pressing you know this but instead of
stopping it so I can only stop it and
start a whole new recording button those
two downfalls definitely have to say
this is the best sound quality as far as
quality goes the best sound recorder
that I've ever used and I definitely
recommend it alright that's it for me in
this review the statement from fumble
comm thanks for watching it and don't
forget to visit fumble comm for more
cellphone news reviews and how to's
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
