Philip calm and in this video will show
you how to set up your wireless
tethering our portable hotspot on your
Android phone so the first thing you
don't want to do is go over to your
settings and under settings if you're an
Ice Cream Sandwich and above you're
going to look for wireless networks and
then hit more otherwise if you're on 2.3
or below hit wireless networks and then
it should take you to a list of options
which looks something like this
regardless of the version look for
something along the lines of tethering
and portable hotspot tap on that guy and
to enable it you're just going to check
this Wi-Fi hotspot checkbox now before I
do that to activate it I'm gonna show
you my Windows Phone really quick that
doesn't have a sim card in it so it
relies only on Wi-Fi networks to be able
to connect to the internet as you can
see there is no connected network right
now and I'll go ahead and activate this
guy so I hit activate portable Wi-Fi
hotspot' while hitting the check box you
can see my notification bar gives me a
notification saying that the hotspot is
active and now when we look at my other
phone you can see there's an android
network available and it automatically
connected because I've connected it
before and there is no password so it
connects automatically but if you wanted
to change that for example I could hit
configure Wi-Fi hotspot and I can change
the name right here but I won't do that
for the pros in this video but I will
add a password so I hit security and
then WPA PSK and I'll just make a
password really quick I'll just do eight
zeros because you do have to have a
minimum of eight characters so I'll just
do one two three four five six seven
eight and then hit done hit save right
here and now my Wi-Fi network is
password protected so not just anybody
will be able to connect to you so if
you're just trying to let a friend
connect to you you know you'll have to
worry about everybody at the Starbucks
connecting to you and using up your
bandwidth anyways let's go back to my
Windows Phone and see you know what's
going on so it still or it doesn't say
it's connected network because it is
secure so before it was connected
because there's no password now it's not
connected if I try to connect see says
the network settings are different from
the one
selected so let's hit delete and I
actually have to reconnect so it batt
announced asking for a password so
entering the password so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
hit done and you can see it's now
connected to the network so now I can go
over to the Internet and let's just tap
on an article with a quick eye let's tap
on this guy and we'll see if the
Internet's working as you can see it is
it's floating up the article and there
you go you have internet on another
phone off of the Android phone and to
disable the portable hotspot all you
gonna do is uncheck it
so I unchecked it and now you can see on
this one if I wanted to click on another
article so let's click on reviews real
quick on phone buff let's see what
happens so you can see it's trying to
load it up but hasn't shown us anything
yet and we should get an error there you
go yeah says having problems displaying
the page because there is no internet
connection and that's because we
disabled it but that's pretty much it
