that iOS 10 is their biggest software
update yet so today we're gonna go over
ten of the top new features coming to
iOS top new feature number one Siri for
all third-party developers can now
utilize Siri which means you'll be able
to do things from asking Siri to hail
you an uber to sending your friend a
message via whatsapp to delete stock
apps you know those Apple apps that you
never use well you can delete them now
and redownload them later if you need to
from the App Store three mo bettah phone
app the phone app has been updated with
the ability to support services like
Skype transcribe your voicemails
automatically and my personal favorite
alerting you if an incoming call is
likely to be spam for homekit app with
apple's new home app you can control all
of your home care enabled devices from
one place so if you want to close the
blinds and the garage door you can do so
without having to switch between
different apps you can also set scenes
to automate multiple actions like
turning off the lights disabling the AC
and locking the doors with a single
press of a button when you leave your
house or go to sleep 5 improve the
iMessage iMessage got a whole lot better
with iOS 10 your messages can now be a
modified with just a few taps which is
even more useful since Apple made emojis
three times bigger
but if emojis alone aren't enough to get
your point across
you also have bubble effects which can
give your messages that extra oomph they
were missing before with animations for
a more personal touch you can send
handwritten notes and drawings or if
you're pressed for time
you're fine without saying anything at
all would have back reactions rich link
support means being able to watch that
YouTube clip a friend sent you without
having to leave the thread and an app
drawer allows app developers to add
special features that will work right
within iMessage itself oh and you can
finally turn off read receipts by
conversation so you can choose who gets
to know whether or not you read their
message 6 better keyboard the quicktype
keyboard now has improved contextual
awareness being able not only to predict
where you're likely to want to type
but also do things like offer your
current location when a friend asks you
where you are or even making the
person's contact information handy when
someone asks you for it the keyboard
also supports multilingual typing so you
can type in different languages without
having to switch keyboards CF it
improved maps Apple maps has come a long
way since his debut with iOS 10 bringing
some much-needed features to the app
maps now practically gives you driving
directions based off both your calendar
events and learning your routine you can
also search for points of interest like
coffee shops or gas stations along the
route with maps giving you an estimate
of how much of a delay the pitstop will
make 8 refreshed Control Centre iOS 10
gives control center a nice refresh with
two new panes that let you control your
music and your favorite scenes and
accessories from the home app 9
lockscreen enhancements and you raise
the wake feature lets you see your lock
screen by simply raising the phone up if
you have a missed message you can reply
to it right then and there using 3d
touch swiping the lock screen over to
the left reveals the new widgets pane
while swiping over to the right gives
you quick and easy access to the camera
and finally top new feature number 10
updated Photos app the Photos app in iOS
10 is taking a page from both Google
Photos and HTC Zoe photos will now group
your pictures into memories based off of
events locations and the people inside
of those photos it can also create
little video montages with music and all
bringing the past memory back to life
alright so those are the top 10 new
features coming to iOS 10 the general
theme is that iOS is opening up to
third-party developers kind of similar
to Android which is definitely something
I've been wanting for a while now so
kudos to Apple for finally getting it
done but anyways that is it for me in
this video thank you for watching and as
always I'll see you in the very next
episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
