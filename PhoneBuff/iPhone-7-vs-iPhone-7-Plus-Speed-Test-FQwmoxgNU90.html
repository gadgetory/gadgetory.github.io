all know that the iPhone 7 is a beast
when it comes to performance but did you
know that the iPhone 7 plus actually has
an extra gigabyte of RAM at 3 gigabytes
instead of just the 2 gigabytes found on
the smaller iPhone 7
now of course despite having just 2
gigabytes of RAM the iPhone 7 has had no
problem keeping all the apps in the
normal speed test open in the background
which you can't really say about some
Android phones that have double data
mounts so today we're going to be adding
a few more apps to the speed test in
order to push each phone to their limits
so we can see whether or not that extra
gigabyte of RAM on the 7 plus actually
adds up to extra performance but before
we get to the speed test I want to give
a big shout-out to Braintree payments
for sponsoring today's video so
developing your own mobile app can be
complex but integrating your own payment
option no longer has to be with
Braintree your business can accept
nearly every type of payment from any
device with just one integration
everything from pesos to PayPal to
Android pay and whatever payment option
comes next
Braintree simple flexible SDKs make your
job and your payments easier
learn more at Braintree payments comm /
phone buff all right let's get to the
speed test so you know the drill will
kick things off by starting to
stopwatches on each phone and then jump
into the first row of system apps where
like you'd expect the two phones perform
just about the same as each moves on to
the gaming row now because both phones
have the same nvme storage the same a10
fusion processor and they're both
running on the same exact software I
don't expect to see much of a difference
here in the first lab in fact there are
only two things that can possibly make a
difference here in the speed test the
first is obviously the extra gigabyte of
RAM on the iPhone 7 plus which we
already talked about and the second is
the difference in resolution with these
seven plus technically pushing more
pixels but as you can see here and as
we've seen in speed tests in the past it
doesn't look like a higher resolution
screen makes much of a difference with
the phone's loading up and even jumping
into the games here at about the same
rate and
the games you may have noticed that
we've added a few more games to this
speed test than we normally do in fact
many of you have asked why we include so
many games in the speed test in the
first place and the reason is simple
games are generally much heavier
applications than other apps like
Facebook and Twitter so they take more
processing power to launch and usually
take up more memory and RAM this in turn
helps push each device to its absolute
limits allowing us to see which device
actually performs better with a smaller
amount of total apps in the speed test
so yeah you may not play games on a
daily just as you may not create time
lapses as both devices are finishing up
here but these kind of apps do a great
job at showing you what you can
generally expect out of each phone over
the long run and from the looks of it so
far the experience you'll get from the
iPhone 7 and 7 plus is going to be
roughly the same
at least when it comes to initially
loading up apps with both bones
finishing up the first lap with a time
of 1 minute and 40 seconds okay so here
we go the moment we've all been waiting
for will that extra gigabyte of RAM make
a difference and yes the two gigs on the
iPhone 7 has been maxed out without
having to reload asphalt 8 as it does
Angry Birds
allowing the iPhone 7 plus to finally
pull ahead so let's see how the iPhone 7
handles the other apps and okay it looks
like it's keeping some of the other apps
ready to go in the background so that's
good news for the iPhone 7 with the 7
plus looking to have all the apps open
to the background finishing with a total
time of 2 minutes and 13 seconds with
the iPhone 7 and it's 2 gigabytes of RAM
actually holding up pretty well having
all the other apps besides those first
two games ready to go finishing 10
seconds later with the time of 2 minutes
and 23 seconds making the winner and a
new phone book style speedtest champ the
iPhone 7 plus that is it for me in this
video thank you guys for watching and as
always I'll see you in the very next
episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
