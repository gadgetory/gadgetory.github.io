something you may have noticed on the
Nexus 7 if you have one is that there's
no icon for the camera but I mean no
matter what you do or no matter where
you look you know under widgets or apps
or whatever it is there's no option to
actually open up the camera so it's
actually really easy to solve just go
into your Play Store hit search type in
Nexus 7 and then camera that should be
good enough and you see it says camera
launcher by Mota Cal thankfully they
made this you just happen stall of
course except and basically it gives you
that camera icon that you were looking
for so now you can see boom got the
camera tap on it and our front-facing
camera was not working and it's fully
functional this like it is with the
regular camera app you can take panorama
pictures videos regular pictures and you
can even do a time-lapse so anyway
that's it for me this videos want to
share that with you guys because I was
wondering where the heck that camera app
was basically I think Google pretty much
intended for people just used a video
chat but hey I want to be able to use my
camera for other things so anyway that's
it for me in this video we found it
helpful please hit the like button and
subscribe to channel thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
