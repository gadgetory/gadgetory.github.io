in this video i'm doing a review slash
how-to on the square up available for
both Android and iOS so with that said
I'll go ahead and open up the app and
I've already signed up and made my
account everything so when I open up the
app I'm taking this screen basically the
screen is just asked me for an amount to
put into charge so let's say $1 and I
could actually leave a description for
the transaction so I could say you know
for video purposes I shall go ahead and
do that so say phone buff video so phone
buff video excuse my horrible typing
alright
so phone buff video I can even take a
picture of something if I want to by
pressing this camera button and then to
make the charge I can either plug in the
credit card reader which they send to
you for free and I'll go over that in
just a second or I could say I wanted to
put in the credit card number manually I
could do that as well and hit authorize
card or I can hit cash and you know just
keep square in charge of my all my
finances all or all my transactions so
anyway I'm gonna go ahead and show you
the free card reader that actually send
you upon signing up so let me go ahead
and get that let me zoom out push this
guy out of the way for a second alright
so this is what they sent you in the
mail so it says square card reader and
I'll go ahead and open it up comes a
nice little packaging
alright so it says welcome to square
gives you some instructions and when you
open it up you have little stickers even
for a square Visa MasterCard Americans
and whatnot that you could post on your
sticker or whatever you want but here's
the reader right here so you pull it out
of that little padding you see goes into
your headphone jack has a little slit
right there and you can just swipe the
card right through so let's go ahead and
do that so I'm just going to go ahead
and get my phone and plug this guy in to
my headphone jack so plugged it in you
can see the phone recognized that I
plugged it in and I'm gonna go ahead and
swipe a credit card so this is actually
a gift card so don't get excited here's
the strip right here and I'm just going
to go ahead and swipe it and try
show you the screen at the same time so
there you go says authorizing approved
and there you go now it takes me to this
screen which is asking for a signature
so you can see the little line saw this
sign I'll do dayvid
yeah continue to receipt and right here
says SMS or email receipt so I can
either send a text message to the person
that bought something or I could send a
via email so you can see I got an email
saying that a transaction has been done
on my account anyway I'll go ahead and
send via email analysis do david at
phonebook calm so david at bomba calm
all right and it'll send me a receipt so
that way if i wanted to print it out I
could so basically the purpose of that
is if you're using this for business
your customers could actually get a copy
of the receipt email to them or text
them so that way the kid you know prove
that they bought something from you if
they need it for like a tax deduction or
anything like that so anyway we'll go
ahead and hit finish close to skip the
receipt by the way it says one dollar
paid thanks done and that's it it's as
easy as that pretty cool um and just let
you guys know it does charge you a 2.75%
fee so whenever you do use the app it
charges you 2.75 percent which is
honestly really reasonable considering
there's no minimum monthly fees
associated with it so definitely
recommend it think it's really cool to
have on your phone and a little card
reader just makes it even more awesome
alright that's it for me in this video
this day from FOMO calm thank you for
watching it and don't forget to visit
Bombo procom for more cellphone news
reviews and how to's thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
