in the market for a big phone
more than likely either the Galaxy Note
8 or the iPhone 8 plus has crossed your
mind and unlike in the past both of
these phones are actually using an
all-glass design samsung has been using
all glass designs for a while now and
they've made a number of durability
improvements over the years but for
Apple like this is the first time
they've had an all-glass phone since
2011 yes they're claiming that the
iPhone 8 plus is using the strongest
class to ever be used in a smartphone
which you know really only means one
thing it's time for a phone buff style
drop test but before we get into it I
want to thank tech 21 for sponsoring
today's episode so when tech 21 sent us
their Evo check case for the iPhone 8
plus they asked us to do what we do best
and put it to the test and when we did
the case handled the back corner and
face drops like it was nothing tech21
protects drop after drop with the iPhone
8 plus we tested still being in perfect
condition this is thanks to a
scientifically proven material with a
three layer protection system that
spreads out and absorbs the impact
energy preventing it from passing on to
your device the Evo check case is
available for both the iPhone 8 plus and
the Galaxy Note 8 in a number of
different colors so click on that first
link down below in the description and
get your phone the protection it
deserves all right let's get to the drop
test round number one backdrop and three
two one alright so the good news is that
Bullough phones remain fully functional
after that backdrop but the bad news is
both of them have their back glass
shattered the iPhone 8 plus looks like
it has more spider rubbing overall on
the back but the note eights damage
actually looks a lot more severe up at
the top right of the phone so really not
the best results from either device
round number two corner drop and three
two one
after that corner drop both phones get
some scuff marks on their aluminum bands
the damage really isn't actually all
that bad but it does look like the
scuffs on the note eighths are slightly
deeper than the ones on the iPhone given
the iPhone this slight advantage in
round number two round number three face
drop and three two one okay so while the
face drop cracks the glass on both bones
it's actually not as bad as I thought it
would be especially on the Galaxy Note 8
where most of its damage is contained to
the corners this is most likely thanks
to the curved edges on the phone and
it's a great result because most of the
actual touch screen remains unaffected
meaning you could probably use it
without cutting yourself at least not as
bad as you would on the iPhone where a
good chunk of the top right of the
display has some spider rubbing so easy
win for the note 8 in round number three
bonus round okay so with bow phones
still being technically usable we
entered the bonus round where we drop
each phone directly onto steel from much
higher up which should put the shock and
impact resistance of each phone to the
test
up first is the Galaxy Note 8 3 2 okay
there's no way nope we are still rocking
and 3 2 1
oh I see glass like blowing every time I
poles all right now we got some serious
chattering going all the way across and
drop okay I think this one actually
killed it because when they hit the
platform like I saw light kind of
dispersed around nope still working all
right
laughs rough can I survive all ten three
two one
and oops
turn it off working all right survived
all ten drops all right so the note
eight technically survives all ten drops
the screen is still responsive and still
fully functional however this is
definitely not something that you'd want
to use on a daily basis the glass on the
back of the phone suffered arguably more
damage than the glass on the front with
all the impact from the high level drops
spreading that pre-existing damage in
terms of functionality after doing our
10 point inspection everything on a note
eight still works save for the camera in
the flash which no matter how many times
we try to open it or restart it it just
wouldn't work so disappointing results
and let's see if the iPhone 8 plus can
do any better
three two one perfect drop with the
results still working three two one oh
my gosh
okay all right so literally a trunk a
chunk of glass Bella this is crazy I've
never seen that before
Wow super shatter screen but it's still
working
oh my god this is brutal okay three two
one
okay glass almost hit me hey my face
that is crazy this is getting dangerous
Oh No oh it's I think it's dead
this is dead I don't care if it's not
responding all right I mean it kind of
responds but then I like freaked out so
how about throw in the towel guys this
one's done so unfortunately the iPhone 8
plus doesn't make it all the way through
the bonus round like the note eight did
with it literally falling apart with
chunks missing from the back and that
the screen is completely unusable at
this point with a major portion of the
LCD being blacked out now I've seen this
happen on phones before and typically
once it gets to this point it's only a
matter of time before the damage spreads
all the way through the phone and it
completely gives out and as if that
wasn't bad enough just like with the
note eight the camera on the iPhone Ace
Plus doesn't work but to its credit it
at least launches the camera app where
the note aids didn't even let us do that
okay so with all the rounds complete
let's take a look at the score card
we're in the first round the iPhone just
barely squeaks past the notes eight it
also got the upper hand in the second
round but in the third round the no
dates made a comeback in a major way and
finished off the iPhone in the fourth
making it the winner here in this drop
test anyways that is it for me in this
video thank you guys for watching and as
always I'll see you in the very next
episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
