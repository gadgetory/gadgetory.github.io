today I will be doing a video on how to
switch a system apk file I already did a
video on how to delete a stock app this
is pretty much the same process except
for we're not actually going to be
removing it out we're going to be
replacing it so with that said just go
ahead and go into it you're gonna need
to have root permissions and you're
going to need to have root explorer so
once you have those two things go ahead
and open up root explorer you want to go
to the the file where you put the apk on
now I connected my phone to my computer
and put it on my SD card so I'm going to
go into my SD card and find the file so
I'm replacing the music player so I'm
playing home and show you guys what the
music player actually looks like you can
see it right here it's pink I'm going to
be replacing it one that's actually blue
the app itself is the same just the
icons different there's a minor updates
um
I'm putting on a newer version so let's
go back to root explorer and I'm gonna
hit move and then I'm gonna go down to
my root folder on my phone you can tell
you at the root by looking at the top
bar if there's a slash mark and there's
nothing behind it you're you're in your
root folder but if there's something
behind it you're not so just hit back
until you get to this and zoom out from
here where you want to where you want to
go is to a system folder so you see
right there it says system and then from
the system folder you go into the app
folder and this is where all your apks
are so my music apk is already in here
at least my old version I'm gonna hit
paste and it's gonna ask me do I want to
replace it because it already exists so
I'm gonna hit yes and now
let's go to my music player yep
there you go you see that the blue icon
now and it's working you know just
because it's the same app it works the
same but the little tweaks are fixes
that this new version brings are now
included on my phone so you can do this
with any app whether it be the music app
messaging um the browser doesn't really
matter the same process goes so yep
that's it for me this is David from foam
bluff calm thank you for watching the
video and I don't forget to check out
foam buff comm for cell phone news
reviews and how to's thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
