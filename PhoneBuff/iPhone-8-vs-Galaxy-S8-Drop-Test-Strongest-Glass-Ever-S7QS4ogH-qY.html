did a drop test on the iPhone 8 plus but
we still haven't done one for the
smaller and lighter iPhone 8 which just
like the H+ apples claiming to have the
strongest class to ever be used on a
smartphone now the jury is still out on
whether or not that statement has any
truth to it so today we're gonna be
dropping the iPhone eight side by side
next to another glass phone in the
Galaxy s8
to see which one is actually more
durable but before we get to the test
I want to thank tech 21 for sponsoring
today's episode
so when tech 21 sent us their Evo check
case for the iPhone 8 they asked us to
do what we do best and put it to the
test and when we did the case handled
the back corner and face drops like it
was nothing tech 21 protects drop after
drop with the iPhone 8 we tested still
looking flawless Tech 21 cases are drop
tested 20 times to ensure durability and
long-lasting protection to be able to
withstand the multiple drops that occur
in the everyday use of a smart phone the
Evo check case is available for both the
iPhone 8 and the Galaxy S eights in the
number of different colors so click on
that first link down below in the
description and get your phone the
protection it deserves all right let's
get to dropping round number one
backdrop in three two one
so that backdrop cracked the glass on
the Galaxy s8 but on the iPhone there's
not so much as a scratch the glass is
completely intact
and it shows no signs of damage this
result is actually somewhat surprising
given what we saw with the iPhone 8 plus
but you know maybe the smaller body or
the lighter weight played a role here so
really impressive results and an easy
win for the iPhone in round number one
round number two corner drop and three
two one
after that corner drop both bones get
some nasty scuffs on there aluminium
bands however the scuffs do seem to run
a little bit deeper on the galaxy s 8
given the iPhone the slight advantage in
round number two round number three base
drop right in three two one all right so
once again the Galaxy s8 has this glass
crack and just like with the backdrop
the results aren't actually all that bad
most of the S eights damage is contained
to the edges but the real story here is
the iPhone 8 with its glass once again
coming away unscathed I was thinking
that the backdrop might have been just a
fluke but nope the face drop gets us the
same exact result so Wow just a really
impressive result giving some
credibility behind Apple's statement of
using the strongest class ever on a
smart phone and easily earning at the
win here in round number three bonus
round okay so with both phones still
being technically usable we entered the
bonus round where we drop each phone
directly on to steal from much higher up
which should put the shock and impact
resistance of each phone to the test
last time the Galaxy s8 survived all 10
drops in the bonus round showing its
high level of impact resistance with our
10 point inspection finding it to be
fully functional of course the initial
damage from the first three drops was
only
masturbated in the bonus round with the
glass on both the front and the back
being even more shattered but let's see
if the iPhone eight can do any better
all right three two all right still
going no cracks three two one okay ooh
that's interesting
a little shatter on the back on that
drop so that is the impact and the front
actually is doing fine that's kind of
interesting the fat guy without the
front three two one okay
damn it on the back still looks the same
whoo so we have shattering on the run
club hook what three bonus drops to get
some shattering but it looks like screen
itself for working three two one
oh all right still going at some chunks
of glass is actually missing from the
front the back a little more spider
webbing but technically still works
camera still works
all right iPhone just one more and you
make it all the way through three two
one I don't wanna look at this one nice
come on can I survive
yes it did sweet so the iPhone eight
survives all ten bonus drops as well
actually being the first iPhone to ever
do so and while it definitely took a
beating and saw it's originally
undamaged glass cracked all over the
phone takes most of the check boxes in
our ten point inspection the touchscreen
still remains fully functional however
there is some damage to the LCD itself
which may or may not get worse over time
also the selfie cam seems to be affected
as well however this is most likely not
due to the camera itself but to hold
that cracked glass in front of it okay
so with all four rounds in the books
let's take a look at the score card
we're in the first round the iPhone
eight just dominated the galaxy s 8 with
its glass remaining fully intact the
iPhone got the edge in the second round
dominated again in the third the SI it's
got the edge in the fourth but overall
the winner by a huge margin is the
iPhone eight anyways that is it for me
in this video thank you guys for
watching and as always I'll see you in
the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
