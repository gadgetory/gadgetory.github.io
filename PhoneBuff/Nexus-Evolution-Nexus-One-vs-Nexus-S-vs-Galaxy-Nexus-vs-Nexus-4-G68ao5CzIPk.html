film buff and in this video we're gonna
be taking a look at the evolution of
Google's Flash for smartphones
otherwise known as their Nexus devices
now looking at this collection here you
may be counting 1 2 3 4 &amp;amp; 5 &amp;amp; you may be
thinking now wait a minute
that 4th box there is for the Galaxy
Nexus and the fifth one is definitely
for the Nexus 4 so what's inside that
first box well it's not a nexus at least
not technically these four here are your
actual Nexus devices or should I say in
next I so again what's inside of this
box well like we do on the channel every
now and then let's do an unboxing and
find out and the mysterious device
inside of the mysterious HTC branded box
is none other than the HTC dream or more
commonly known as the g1 as in the og
numero uno the smartphone that started
it all for Android so you know it just
had to include it in this video now
before we get into how these devices
evolved over time I want to let you guys
know that if you want to pick up any of
these bad boys which you know the older
ones are kind of like collector items
now you can find a link right below the
like button of this video for pricing
and availability so in the beginning
there was like I said the g1 which
launched with Android 1.0 when you look
at the phone it isn't something that's
necessarily nice to look at by today's
standards and to be honest it wasn't
nice to look at back in late 2008 either
I remember when I was rocking the g1
showing off all the cool things you can
do to my iPhone buddies and they just
look at the phone and say your phone's a
brick and it has an ugly chin and you
know what it was true I tried to sell
them on the idea that the chain was
designed to align with your face and
that it also protected the screen from
scratches when you lay it flat on the
counter but they didn't really buy into
it and just kind of went off with their
mms list video capitalist iPhones while
the g1 definitely didn't win any style
awards it did bring with it some
features that were much appreciated it
had a physical slide-out keyboard I had
a unique hinge that actually held up
pretty nicely the keyboard itself was
pretty good and even had a dedicated row
for numbers the g1 had buttons for both
making an ending calls as well as a menu
home and back button which we still see
on some Android devices today right in
between those buttons was a
Oh trackball which meant you were pretty
much able to navigate throughout the
entire OS without ever having to touch
the screen the TFT touchscreen and the
g1 was 3.2 inches diagonally and I had a
resolution of 320 by 480 on the back
there was a 3.2 megapixel camera a
speaker right next to where an LED flash
would normally be and a with Google logo
in the center on the right side of the
phone you had a dedicated camera button
on the left there was a volume rocker
and micro SD card slot there was nothing
up top and at the bottom he had what was
standard back then in a mini USB
charging port which also doubled as the
headphone jack so long as he had an
adapter yeah not having the built-in
headphone jack sucked pretty bad under
the hood you'd find a 1,150 milliamp
battery and just to put that in
perspective that's almost half of what's
inside the Nexus 4 the processor the g1
had on board was made by Qualcomm and
was just a single core clock to have 528
megahertz or 0.5 gigahertz for those of
you who don't remember the days when
mobile CPUs were measured in megahertz
the g1 had only 192 megabytes of RAM and
had just 256 megabytes of internal
memory which when you'd run out of space
after installing just a couple of apps
so after considering all these
jaw-dropping specs the next logical
question that comes to mind is what were
the dimensions well like my friend said
the thing was a brick with the thickness
of 17 millimeters and a weight of 158
grams but thankfully just like with the
specs Google improved on this with each
and every new Nexus flagship which
brings us to the nexus one or the first
real Nexus smartphone that launched with
the Android 2.0 Eclair though the Nexus
1 was manufactured by HTC just at the g1
you wouldn't think the same company made
both phones when looking at them side by
side while the g1 lacked polish Tim
didn't really look like the finished
product the Nexus One was arguably one
of the best design smart phones out in
early 2010 HTC and Google did away with
the slide-out keyboard making the Nexus
One 33% thinner than the g1 at eleven
point five millimeters and 18% lighter
at 130 grams who will also up the
display size from a 3.2 inch TFT to a
3.7 inch AMOLED screen while increasing
the resolution to 800 by 480 physical
buttons were replaced by capacitive ones
in the trackball made its second and
final appearance on a Google flagship
smartphone instead of the call and
button like on
gee one there was a power button added
up top along with the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack on the bottom the mini
USB charging port was changed to what is
now standard in micro USB and there was
also three pins at the bottom for
docking but the accessories never really
became widely available sound familiar
anyway with no dedicated camera button
there is nothing on the right side and
only a volume rocker on the left on the
back the width Google logo was changed
to just Google and the camera was
upgraded to a 5.0 megapixel shooter with
LED flash underneath the back cover
there was a 1400 million battery and
just like on the g1 there's a software a
micro SD card and a mini sim powering
the Nexus One was a qualcomm scorpion
single core processor clocked at one
gigahertz coupled with 512 megabytes of
RAM which were actually really exciting
specs back in the day with double the
processing power double the RAM a better
camera and a bigger screen with higher
resolution it's somewhat needless to say
that the Nexus 1 was a huge improvement
over Google's previous flagship but I
don't know if I could say the same for
its third flagship the Nexus S made by
Samsung which launched with Android 2.3
Gingerbread while there are definitely
improvements over the Nexus One they
weren't nearly as drastic at least not
on paper in fact to an uneducated eye a
lot of the major specs looked to be just
about the same the processor was still a
1 gigahertz single core they're still
just 512 megabytes of RAM the slightly
larger four inch Super AMOLED screens
resolution was the same as was the
cameras megapixel count now Spencer do
specs and real-world performance did
actually favor the Nexus S / the Nexus 1
but again the difference wasn't that big
now that's not to say that the Nexus S
was a disappointment while it didn't
improve leaps and bounds over the Nexus
1 in some departments it did bring with
it some things of the g1 and the Nexus 1
didn't even have one inspect sheet like
what well for one I had a VGA
front-facing camera which as hard as it
is to believe was something new to
Android and maybe even more exciting was
the fact that it had NFC capabilities
which automatically made other phones
without NFC feel outdated there were
officially no more physical buttons of
trackballs on the front with just four
capacitive buttons for back menu search
and home unlike the HTC one though these
buttons were nearly invisible when they
weren't illuminated which really gave
the Nexus S that sleek back look that
we've now come to associate with Nexus
devices like the g1
Google decided to make the Nexus S curve
to feel more natural when holding it
against your face except this time they
got it right and made it look way way
sexier with the curved glass no more
chin well at least not on the front at
the bottom of the Nexus S you had your
micro USB charging port and 3.5
millimeter headphone jack on the left
there was a volume rocker and on the
right you'd find the power button both
of which have remained in the same spots
in later generation Nexus smartphones
underneath the hood was a 1500 milliamp
battery a 100 million improvement over
the Nexus 1 and as you can see there was
no micro SD card slot which started here
with the Nexus S and unfortunately has
continued on with later generations but
the good news was that the Nexus S had
16 gigabytes of USB storage and 10 times
the internal storage which meant you
could pretty much install as many apps
as you'd like something you couldn't
really do with the first two google
flagships overall the Nexus S was really
a mixed bag it brought with it many
improvements along with a few
disappointments but thankfully Google
and Samsung's next attempt was at least
in my opinion much better the Galaxy
Nexus was a game changer for Android
launching with the totally redesigned
Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich
but the OS wasn't the only thing that
was redesigned the phone itself looks
very different from what we were used to
seeing with Android phones at least up
until that point continuing on with the
trend of less and less buttons whether
they're physical or capacitive the
Galaxy Nexus had none on the front you
just had an earpiece a 1.3 megapixel
front-facing camera and a huge 4.6
5-inch display that's right I said huge
because back then a 4.6 5-inch display
was huge relatively speaking Google and
Samsung stuck with a curved display
which had for the first time on a Nexus
an HD resolution of 1280 by 720 giving
you super sharp quality that none of
Google's previous flagships could rival
powering all those pixels was a 1750
milliamp battery a 250 million of
improvement over the Nexus S
under the hood was a dual-core Texas
Instruments OMAP processor clocked at
1.2 gigahertz and as if doubling the
cores in increasing the clock speed
wasn't enough they doubled the ram as
well up to 1 gigabyte for improved
multitasking on the right side of the
phone you had your power button and
three pins for docking which just like
what the Nexus One accessories never
became widely available for on the left
there was a volume rocker and up top
there was nothing but it's worth
mentioning
the phone had a tapered design where the
top end was much thinner than the bottom
measuring in at eight point nine
millimeters speaking of the bottom it
had a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack in a
microUSB charging port on the back was
for the third time a five megapixel
camera with LED flash of course just
like the Nexus S is five megapixel
shooter improved over two Nexus one's
the Galaxy Nexus this camera was the
best of the 5 megapixel Bunch delivering
better photo quality and 1080p video
capture out of all the Nexus devices I
think I'd have to say that the Galaxy
Nexus was my favorite mainly because it
helped take Android to a whole nother
level what's your favorite Nexus let us
know down in the comments below but
maybe before you do that let's take a
look at Google's latest flagship
smartphone and the last one we'll be
covering in this video the Nexus 4 the
Nexus 4 was manufactured by LG and
launched with Android jelly bean 4.2
when the Nexus 4 debuted it was
undeniably the best smartphone in the
world at least dollar-for-dollar it had
a beautiful non curved 4.7 inch HD IPS
display with a 1280 by 768 resolution
and it continued that sleek back look
that was introduced with the Nexus S
with nothing but an earpiece and a 1.3
megapixel camera on the Gorilla Glass
covered front on the back for the first
time on a Nexus smartphone there was no
removable back cover instead you were
met with the Gorilla Glass dotted
glitter pattern that's only really
visible when holding the phone at an
angle in the light the Google logo that
had appeared on all previous Flash's
tools changed to Nexis indicating that
Google wanted the Nexus liner to be
looked at as more of its own brand also
on the back for the first time since the
Nexus 1 Google of the megapixel count on
the camera to eight megapixels with an
LED flash under the hood there were
several significant improvements for one
the amount of cores in the processor was
doubled once again to a quad-core
Snapdragon s4 pro
clocked at 1.5 gigahertz following suit
the RAM was also doubled to a whopping 2
gigabytes to help power the larger
screen and the more powerful Hardware
Google and LG were able to fit in a
2,100 milliamp battery an improvement of
350 over the Galaxy Nexus all while
keeping the phone relatively thin at 9.1
millimeters the power button and volume
rocker appeared in the same spots as it
did on the Galaxy Nexus but this time on
the left side these are not having
we'll back cover there's also a slot for
a micro SIM card meaning that if you're
coming from the Galaxy Nexus you need to
change your mini sim as the card would
no longer fit for the first time since
the Nexus 1 the 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack was moved back up top and like all
the flagship google smartphones before
it the charging port could be found at
the bottom of the Nexus 4 with
everything I just mentioned about the
Nexus 4 it was already a big step up
from the Galaxy Nexus but Google and LG
had one final trick up their sleeves
with the introduction of qi wireless
charging sure the compatible accessories
took over four months to come to market
but having the ability to charge your
smartphone without having to plug it in
every time you wanted to do it just may
have been worth the wait okay so while
the Nexus 4 was definitely a big step up
from the Galaxy Nexus it was an
incredibly amazingly huge ginormous step
up from where Google started just a few
short years ago with the g1 with one and
a half times the screen size six times
the resolution four times the cords
three times the clock speed ten times
RAM double the battery and two and a
half times the camera with the addition
of NFC chip arla charging a front-facing
camera and a whole bunch of other things
that I probably forgot to mention it's
crazy to think how much these phones
have you balked over time and it only
makes me wonder well Google and his
partners have in store for the next
Nexus smartphones alright guys that is
pretty much it for me in this video if
