LastPass what's up guys David here and
the wopo 7 pro and the galaxy has 10
plus already went up against each other
in our speed test where 1 plus was able
to take the crown away from samsung to
become the new speed test champ and
today it's looking to take another title
away from the s10 Plus this time its
title as the fumble style battery test
champ now as you guys probably already
know our battery tests take a lot of
time to conduct we test over multiple
days and we even reran the SM pluses
test again after we received some
software updates so I wanted to give a
big thanks to LastPass for sponsoring
this video and allowing us to bring you
the extensive testing that you know in
love so we've all been through it you
try to log in to a website or an app and
you get that dreaded error message to
try again so you try another one of your
passwords and then another one and you
basically repeat this process over and
over again until you either finally get
in or you get locked out of your
accounts which is fresh rating but with
LastPass it doesn't have to be that way
LastPass can remember an unlimited
amount of your passwords for you not
just freeing up your mental load but
also letting you log in with literally
just a tap of your finger or a quick
scan of your face depending on the type
of phone that you have with the app
automatically filling everything in for
you we actually tested how long it takes
to log into a site with LastPass versus
typing it in the old-fashioned way and
yeah LastPass just makes things so much
faster
not to mention because you don't have to
remember all of your passwords you can
use the password generator to set up a
different password for all your
different accounts to seriously step up
your security game with additional
measures for security like two factor
authentication supported there's a paid
version of the app that costs just three
dollars a month and you know what's
great is there's also a free version
that still offers a lot of the features
that you'd wants even the ability to
sync across your devices so click on
that first link down below in the
description to get LastPass for free and
plate your passwords on autopilot big
things again till a spy's for sponsoring
this portion of the video but for now
let's get to the battery test
okay we'll start things off with the
phone test where we're making a one-hour
call on each phone considering that both
phones being tested here are running on
the same Snapdragon 855 platform and
that the displays are off for the
majority of this test I don't really
expect there to be too much of a
difference between the two but after one
hour there is a difference and a big one
at that with the sm+ dropping down to
94% and the 1 + 7 pro is still
indicating that it's at 100% now
obviously this can't be the case we know
we used up some battery so it's either
just an inaccurate reading or this could
be one plus this way of sort of nudging
people to charge their phones less by
reducing battery anxiety either way here
in the messaging app we're sending
randomized messages to our chat BOTS
which is texting back with the same set
of responses to keep things even we've
set both phones to their maximum
resolution and of course we've precisely
calibrated each displays brightness to
200 nits after one hour of texting back
and forth it seems like balance is
restored with the wampa 7 Pro dropping
15 percentage points down to 85 percent
and at the s 10 plus dropping only 8%
down to 86 so it looks like that battery
percentage indicator caught up with the
1 + is real battery life with this level
being more in line with what you would
expect here in the email test we've been
opening up unread emails to simulates
how you read email in the real world
we're after one hour of doing so the 1 +
7 Pro seizes battery drop another 10%
down to 75 while the s10 plus is able to
create some separation for itself with
it only dropping by 8% down to 78 giving
it a 3 percentage point advantage so so
far the results are in line with what I
was expecting the 1 + 7 Pro does have
any slightly smaller battery capacity at
4,000 milliamp hours compared to the
4100 on the s10 + and it's screen is
also slightly larger with no hole punch
or notch insights here in the browser
test each phone is cycling through the
same set of websites with a robot also
scrolling through
these websites again to better simulates
how you browse the web in the real world
after the one-hour browsing session the
s10 plus is able to add on to its lead
with it now five percentage points ahead
at 68% compared to the 63% battery on
the oneplus we'll see if oneplus can
turn things around here in Instagram
where each phone is on the home feed and
actually scrolling through the home feed
just like you would in real life and you
know this is especially important here
in this test considering that the
oneplus and pro does have that higher
refresh rate at 90 Hertz compared to the
60 Hertz refresh rate on the s10 plus
now while the higher refresh rate
definitely leads to smoother scrolling
it does come at the cost of higher power
consumption and after one hour the own
+7 Pro did seem to consume more battery
than the s10 plus with its battery
dropping by 11 percentage points down to
52 percent with the sm+ dropping by only
nine percent allowing it to pull a full
seven percentage points ahead about
halfway through this battery test moving
on to the standby test each phone will
idle for 16 hours this is a really
important test as if you think about it
most of the time your phone is actually
on standby whether it's in your pocket
or sitting there on your desk after 16
hours the oneplus 7 pro sees its battery
dropped by only 11% down to 41
while the sm+ dropped by even less at
only 10 percentage points down to 49
which is a definite improvement since we
last tested the s10 presumably thanks to
the software updates here in YouTube we
have both phones playing the same set of
videos with not only the brightness
calibrated but also the speaker's
calibrated to the same decibel counts to
make sure things are as even as possible
and after one hour of YouTube binge
watching it the s10 plus has its battery
dropped by 11% down to 38 while the
oneplus drops by a little more at 12
percent down to 29 so as we head into
the gaming test things aren't looking so
hot for the oneplus 7 pro slowly but
surely it has dug itself into a bit of a
hole here being almost 10%
and it's likely that its battery will
take an even bigger hits here in Altos
adventure where again that 90 Hertz
display may consume more power this game
does actually support higher refresh
rates so it's definitely gonna be a
better gaming experience on the oneplus
but after one hour it clearly comes at
the cost of power consumption with the
oneplus 7 pro dropping by a whopping 16%
down to 13 whereas the s10 plus dropped
by only 12% down to 26 marking the
biggest difference out of any test that
we've done so far and giving the sm+ a
nice cushy lead as we simulates
navigation here in Google Maps we're
after one hour the oneplus second Pro is
just barely hanging on with just 1%
battery remaining compared to these 17%
left on the s10 plus we'll see how far
that last 1% can take the oneplus 7 pro
into the Spotify tests we're just over
three minutes into the test the phone
finally gives out while the s 10 plus
still has 16% remaining so a pretty big
difference between the two we'll go
ahead and fast-forward the sm+ where it
was able to make it through the Spotify
test with 5% still left to go which
allowed it to get into these super
intensive snapchat tests where it
survives 11 additional minutes before
finally calling it quits
okay so with both phones out of juice
let's take a look at the results the 1
plus 7 pro was able to last 24 hours and
3 minutes which you know is not bad but
definitely less than the 25 hours and 11
minutes the S 10 plus was able to last
when you include the 16 hours standby
making the winner and is still the pump
of style battery test champ the galaxy s
10 Plus anyways that is it for me in
this video thank you guys for watching
and as always I'll see you in the very
next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
