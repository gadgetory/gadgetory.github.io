this video me unboxing the Nexus 7
tablet from Asus and that before I did I
so imma give you guys a quick look at
the box itself so on the front you see
the picture of the tablet it's angled
little way so you can see a seven of
course you have the nexus branding over
here asus branding right over here says
nexus 7 again on the back my box is kind
of beat up as you can see it says made
for Google Play it's a full-fledged
android tablet and peer google
experience on the right side nothing
there on the top nothing in the bottom
just the serial code and whatnot so
anyway i'm just going to go ahead and
open this guy up okay so kind of rip the
box a little but that's okay take this
guy out and now we're left without you
know what's really the unboxing which is
this part it says nexus nice and clean
nothing anywhere else so go ahead and
you know fast-forward this part because
he did tape it pretty good on here so
i'll go ahead and fast-forward me
opening this up with a knife real quick
alright so that's two pieces of tape
that I cut I think that's it so let's go
ahead and try to pull this guy out so
the box is like you know feels like
almost like recycled material to me I
don't know okay and there's the tablet
so the tablet was on there of course it
fell off as I was trying to open it so
it's covered in this whole plastic
material wrapped all the way around
we'll go into the device in a little bit
of course we have this little box in
here so this is the box that's holding
it to little cardboard inserts and
nothing else will move that out of the
way here's this little box where we have
the accessories that come with it so
let's go ahead and open this guy up so
USB cable as you'd expect it's USB to
microUSB and I'll just go ahead and pull
it out this is pretty open so the USB
cable looks like this has a little asus
brain i don't know if you guys can see
that on the tip of it pretty nice got
your nexus 7 warranty nexus 7 quick
start guide to you know show us how to
use the device but else got the wall
adapter actually says asus on here as
well so looks pretty nice a lot right
there is where the input goes of course
this goes into the wall and that is it
so no headphones you know it's a tablet
really didn't expect that just got the
USB cable and the charger that's pretty
much it pamphlets and the box but we're
after the device so let's go ahead and
take this plastic interlocking seasons
NFC right over here so kind of lets you
know where the NFC chip it on here go
ahead and pull it out so a first
impression so far within my hand it's
really light I you know definitely a
light device arm feels really good
actually the material on the back is
like it almost feels good I don't know
how to explain it almost like a leathery
material um yeah kind of like a brand
new basket water no well not that rigid
but anyway says Nexus run over here the
bottom says asus speaker grill right
here at the bar
of course you got that seven inch
display HD display that is on the bottom
you have your micro USB charging port
3.5 millimeter headset jack on the left
side we have nothing but this little lot
these little pins kind of like the
Galaxy Nexus head for probably a dock on
the top there's nothing on the right
side you've got your power button for
standby and then your up and down for
volume and that on the front I'll go and
turn on while I'm showing you the rest
so press and hold on this guy I'm really
glad I put on the side because you know
I mean being able to reach over like
this is much easier than going up over
here I've said that about you know
devices my device reviews as well I
always prefer on the side but there's
the boot up animation same one as we saw
on the Galaxy Nexus with jelly bean of
course this guy is running Android 4.1
jelly bean you have the NVIDIA Tegra 3
processor in here so the quad core
processor let's go ahead and hit next it
wants me to connect Wi-Fi let's go ahead
and do that really quick and i'll do it
off-camera really quick all right so
it's connecting to Wi-Fi so the tablet
got google i'm just going to hit know
for now because i don't feel like doing
x want to get into it so you just hit
this little next button says who does
this tablet belong to i'll go ahead and
put in my name so David Rahimi next and
Google services sure instead of complete
so pretty painless I didn't take any
long says authentication required for a
Google Play so I'm just gonna go ahead
and delete this another thing i didn't
mention in my review of jelly bean is
you can actually flip the icons this up
and it'll delete it so pretty cool but
anyway here is the tablet of course i'll
be doing a full review of it later on so
make sure to stay tuned in for that this
is how many apps you have pre-loaded
just basically one page not even go over
to the widgets and you have it there so
anyway that's pretty much it for the
unboxing on the nexus 7 hopefully you
guys enjoyed it
like I said stay tuned for more videos
coming up and be doing a whole bunch of
the next seven</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
