and in this video we're going to be
doing a speed comparison test between
what just may end up being to the top
smartphones in 2013 and the samsung
galaxy s4 and the HTC one both phones
here are the u.s. variants from AT&amp;amp;T
meaning that they both have the qualcomm
made Snapdragon 600 processor and are
each coupled with two gigabytes of RAM
there are a few differences however with
the galaxy s4 having a slightly higher
clock speed at 1.9 gigahertz with ddr3
RAM compared to the 1.7 gigahertz and
the ddr2 ram found on the HTC One will
start off the speed test like we usually
do here at phone buff and do a boot up
test to see which smartphone loads up
it's version of Android first while
these guys are loading up I want to let
you know that both phones are connected
to the same Wi-Fi network and both of
had their browsing history and cache
cleared out which is going to be
important for the browser test that we
do later on alright so as you can see
here the HTC One with this fast-food
optimizations loaded up faster with a
galaxy s4 following shortly thereafter
the next steps we'll do here is a video
transcoding test where we compress the
same video file down to a smaller size
which is a very processor and memory
intensive task that isn't really heavily
dependent upon software now this whole
process actually takes over 6 minutes so
I'm just going to skip through it here
so we can get straight to the results
alright so as you can see the two phones
are neck-and-neck in this test but the
slight edge here does go to the galaxy
s4 with a transcoding the video about 4%
faster than the HTC One did the next P
test we're doing here is the app speed
test where we load up the same map on
both phones to see which one loads up
faster maybe a split second faster with
score Center on the HTC One the videos
tab look to be just about the same and
on the headlines tab again pretty much
neck-and-neck no separation really we'll
go ahead and try to tap on an article
here to see if we get any kind of
difference and they're actually both
taking quite a bit of time this time but
there you go so you can see the HTC One
was about a split second faster than the
Galaxy s4 in this case so for the score
center overall give the lead to the HTC
One loading up the Flex our app we see
the splash screen first on the HTC one
but it looks like the Galaxy s4 I should
load up the thumbnails first the ad may
have played a part so we'll try another
movie listing and no real separation
here I mean maybe a split second faster
on the HTC one but nothing really no
worth mentioning which doesn't come at
much of a surprise considering that they
both have pretty much the same processor
the only difference is the clock speed
again so the fourth and final test will
do here is the browser test and at first
sight will load up it's going to be
phonebook calm and you can see the
content loading up first on the HTC One
but the status bar actually finishes up
first on the galaxy s4 so a little bit
of mixed results can't really see the
rest of the site because it's a mobile
site go ahead and tap on this article
and see if it makes any difference and
again we're not seeing much separation
here the status bar finishes first on
the galaxy s4 we see the content first
on the HTC One but we're not sure what's
going on behind the scenes so we'll go
ahead and go to the verge which
hopefully will give us some separation
because I'd really hate to end this on a
tie considering that the app speed test
was pretty much at I maybe a slight
advantage for the HTC One and actually
we're seeing it load up much faster on
the galaxy s4 so it's actually a pretty
significant difference well go ahead and
tap on this article right here in the
center so that we can see if we could
replicate that result and actually it
does so definitely faster on the mobile
site on the verge on the galaxy s4 we'll
go ahead and try the full site and see
you know which phone actually loads it
up first so for mobile site I'd say that
the edge definitely goes to the galaxy
s4 for the verge on phone book movie the
HTC one had the edge but this is the
real test which has a lot of content on
it and we're seeing the content first on
the galaxy s4 galaxy s4 says it's done
and now the HTC One is done so really
close but the edge does clearly go to
the galaxy s4 in this case similar to
how wasn't the video transcoding but
honestly both phones are super super
smooth them and you can see no lag
whatsoever and you'd probably be happy
with either or at least when it comes to
speed but overall I'd have to say that
the edge goes slightly to the galaxy s4
even though the HTC One in the boot up
test because when it came to the more
processor memory intensive tasks like
video transcoding in the browser the
galaxy s4 I had a bigger margin of
victory but honestly both phones are
super super fast
you wouldn't really notice a difference
unless you were doing a side-by-side
comparison like this and I'd say you'd
be better off making your purchasing
decision based off other factors which
will be doing a lot of videos on here on
farm above so make sure you subscribe to
that alright guys that is pretty much it
for me in this video if you found it
helpful please give it a thumbs up and
