quick video I'm going to show you how to
factory unlock the iPhone 6s which will
allow you to use it on any GSM carrier
worldwide it is worth noting that this
method also works with the iPhone 6s
plus and pretty much any other iPhone
out there now right up front I want to
let you know that this method isn't free
it does cost some money but the money
that you can potentially save on roaming
charges and the resale value it adds
back to your phone could make it well
worth it so the first thing you're going
to want to do is turn off Find My iPhone
which you can do by going into the
settings then iCloud then Find My iPhone
and then flip the switch to the off
position once you've done that go back
to the home screen and open up the
dialer and dial star hash zero six hash
to bring up your iPhones IMEI number
write this number down and make sure
that you get it right as you're going to
need it later next step is to go to
unlockriver.com
where you'll actually be able to get
that unlock code that your phone needs
and just enter in your information so in
my case the carrier is AT&amp;amp;T United
States but be sure to select whatever
carrier your iPhone is actually locked
to manufacturer is Apple when unlocking
the iPhone 6s and then we're going to
enter in that IMEI number that we got
earlier making sure to double check that
it's entered correctly finally putting
your valid email address as this is
where your unlock confirmation will be
sent so as you can see here the unlock
could take a while to process for me you
lose just a few hours but in some rare
cases it can take up to a few business
days so be patient and soon enough
you'll get an email that looks like this
telling you that your iPhone has been
successfully unlocked and from here all
you have to do is enter in an unaccepted
SIM card so basically any SIM card that
isn't from the carrier that your phone
is locked to so in my case since the
phone was locked to AT&amp;amp;T I'll enter in a
Vodafone SIM card and then all you have
to do is connect the phone to Wi-Fi and
that's it your iPhone will be officially
unlocked if you don't have Wi-Fi
available you can always just connect
your iPhone to iTunes and that'll do the
trick as well but anyways that is it for
me in this video thank you guys for
watching in as always I'll see you in
the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
