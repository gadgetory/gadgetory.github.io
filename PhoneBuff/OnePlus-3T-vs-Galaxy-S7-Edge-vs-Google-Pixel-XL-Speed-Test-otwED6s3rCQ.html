three phones are arguably the best
Android smartphones in the world right
now and for very different reasons
you've got the Galaxy s7 edge which in
my opinion has the best Hardware package
on any smart phone including the iPhone
7
you've got the pixel excel which has the
latest version of Android straight from
Google and then you have the one plus 3t
which is probably the best smartphone in
the world dollar-for-dollar so in
today's video we're gonna put all three
in a speed test to see how each stacks
up when it comes to performance but
before we do I want to give a big
shout-out to best fiends for sponsoring
today's video so I actually have it
installed my phone here so we're gonna
check out the game best means forever is
the second game in the Best Fiend
trilogy with the same characters and
story but it's a totally brand new and
different kind of game this is an
addictive clicker adventure game where
you slap tap and pretty much try to
upgrade everything in the game while
also trying to get as far as you can as
fast as you can and starting with this
update they're introducing new limited
time events where you can win special
rewards and it all starts off with slugs
in space so be sure to connect the game
to Facebook so you can compete against
your friends and download the game for
free at the first link down below in the
description all right let's get to the
speed test
so we'll kick things off by starting to
stopwatches on each phone and then head
right into the first row of system apps
where the 1 + 3 T and the pixel XL jump
ahead of the galaxy s7 with there
quicker animations with both phones now
neck and neck as they work on Photoshop
mix where it looks like the 3t has a
split second lead over the pixel as it
starts working on vid trim where all
three phones will have to transcode the
same exact video file and what's
interesting here is the pixel has
actually made up some ground on the 1 +
3 T here in vid trim with both homes now
neck neck once again as they start
working on subway surfers meanwhile the
galaxy s7 is lagging behind a bit
finally finishing with vid trim and
joining the other two in the gaming row
but now almost a full app behind just
over halfway through this first lab so
at least for this first lap it looks
like the real competition is between the
1 + 3 T and the Google pixel where
neither phone has really been able to
jump out ahead of the
and grab a definitive lead but that may
just change here and fit the fat with
the 1 + 3 T and it's higher clocked
Snapdragon 820 one chip pulling ahead of
the Google pixel and finishing up with
fit to fats as it moves on to the last
game in this game hero in smash hit
however the pixel XL is still right
there behind it so there's still a
chance for it to make a comeback but a
comeback by the galaxy s7 at this point
is probably not in the cards with it
falling further and further behind in
this first lap and based on the tests
that we've done so far in the past
things probably won't get any better in
the second lap speaking of which the 3t
is about to enter the second lap as it
finishes the last leg of the first
clocking in a time of 1 minute and 30
seconds with the pixel XL finishing just
6 seconds later with a time of 1 minute
and 36 so here we go the 1 + 3 T and
it's whopping 6 gigabytes of RAM is just
flying through this second lap having
all the apps including the games ready
to go in the background as it inches
closer and closer to lapping the galaxy
s7 will it do it and yes the 1 + 3 T
laughs the galaxy s7 finishing both laps
at a time of 1 minute and 53 seconds
while the galaxy s7 finishes just the
first lap in 1 minute and 55 so we'll go
ahead and fast-forward the other two
phones to the finish line where after
only keeping a few of the ABS ready to
go the pixel XL finishes with a total
time of 2 minutes and 57 seconds and the
galaxy s7 just struggles all the way
through finishing with a total time of 3
minutes and 51 seconds making the winner
and Android speedtest champ
the 1 + 3 T that is it for me in this
video thank you guys for watching and as
always I'll see you in the very next
episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
