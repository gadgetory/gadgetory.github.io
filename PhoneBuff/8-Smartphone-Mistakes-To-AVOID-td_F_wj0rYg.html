so smartphones we all have them we all
know how to use them but from time to
time we can all make some mistakes on
them
so in today's video we're gonna be going
over eight mistakes that you should
avoid making on your smart phone
starting off with mistake number one in
closing your apps a lot of people closed
the apps on their phone thinking that
it'll help speed things up by freeing up
system resources and it'll save battery
by preventing those apps from running in
the background but the irony is
generally speaking the opposite is true
closing an app means that your phone's
processor will have to reload that app
the next time that you use it which not
only slows things down because loading
apps takes time but it also drains your
battery because loading apps uses energy
so in most cases you'd be much better
off just leaving your apps alone letting
them run in the background and trust
that your smartphones OS is smart enough
to close them automatically when it's
most efficient to do so mistake number
two charging it wrong if you're the kind
of person who gets a new smartphone
every year or two then I wouldn't really
worry about how you charge your
smartphone but if you're somebody who's
looking to maximize your battery life
and how well it holds a charge in the
long term then there are a few charging
mistakes that you should avoid the first
mistake is leaving your phone on charge
all throughout the night sure while
smart phones are smart enough to stop
charging once they reach 100 percent
because just being on standby still uses
up some battery your phone will
eventually drop under a 100 percent
charge at which point the phone will
start charging up again back to 100% and
this cycle can repeat itself several
times throughout the night generating
excess heat which ultimately in the long
term can reduce your battery capacity
the other charging mistake that people
make is letting your battery drain to
low or charging it too high in general
it's advised not to let your phone drop
below 20% and not to charge it over 80%
as when you get to either end of these
extremes it puts more pressure on your
battery and ultimately degrades it at a
faster rate mistake number three using
the same passwords may be the biggest
single mistake that people make when it
comes to securing the apps on their
phones is using the same password across
multiple accounts the reason why this is
a mistake is if even just one of those
accounts gets hacked all of your other
accounts
that use that same username and password
can get easily hacked as well now
obviously using a different password for
like each and every one of your accounts
is pretty much impossible to memorize
which is where using a password manager
comes in this episode is sponsored by
LastPass which is a password manager
that can not only remember all of your
different passwords for you but it does
so securely with high level encryption
and multi-factor authentication which
was actually recently updated to support
both Microsoft and Yubikey with LastPass
you won't have to worry about looking
for your passwords or getting locked out
of your accounts as you can keep track
of all of your passwords safely in one
place and conveniently have those
usernames and passwords filled in for
you automatically and supported apps it
just makes the whole process of logging
into your accounts more secure and
easier than ever before so click on that
first link down below to learn more
about LastPass and put your passwords on
autopilot alright moving on number four
using social media apps to save photos
so while there's nothing technically
wrong with taking photos and videos
using social media apps the problem
arises when you start using these apps
to capture more and more of your life's
important moments because unlike the
photos and videos that the camera app
and your phone takes social media apps
heavily compress things in order to make
them more efficient to send which is
great for sharing but absolutely
horrible for quality the same photo
taken on a social app just pales in
comparison to what your phone's camera
app can produce so while I'm not saying
don't use social media apps to share
some of your life's moments I am saying
that it's important to remember that you
can always share a photo or a video that
you took using your phone's camera app
later on but you can never go back in
time to get all that lost detail back
from a photo that you took with a social
app mistake number five handing an
unlocked phone to a stranger now you may
be thinking like okay Dave who actually
hands an unlocked phone to a stranger
and up the answer is more people than
you think when people are out in public
and they're hanging out with like
friends or family they often look for
the first friendly face that they see
and they ask them if they can take a
photo of their group and more often than
not when they hand their phone over it's
unlocked so don't do that
sure you can't control whether or not
a stranger runs away with your phone
okay but if you lock your phone first
and then launch the camera app from the
lock screen at least if they do run away
with your phone they won't be able to
get into any of your stuff mistake
number six not cleaning your phone so
studies have found that the screens on
our smart phones can have up to 10 times
more germs on them than a toilet seat
that's pretty gross right but before you
go driving a bottle of glass cleaner be
aware that cleaning products containing
ammonia or alcohol can actually damage
your screens all your phobic coating the
stuff that keeps your phone fingerprint
resistant so it's advised to regularly
clean your phone with a moist microfiber
cloth which should at least wipe away
most of the germs without scratching or
damaging your screen mistake number 7
not downloading offline maps one of the
best features on a smart phone is the
built-in navigation system but what a
lot of people don't realize is if you
end up making a wrong turn and find
yourself in a cellular dead spots those
turn-by-turn directions that you rely so
heavily on will cease to work but if you
were to download offline maps your
navigation will still work without a
problem as long as you can get a GPS
signal which really only needs a clear
view of the sky so install a mapping app
that supports offline maps and download
maps for any area that you plan on
traveling to and finally mistake number
8 leaving your phone on the table so
there are actually two reasons why you
don't want to leave your phone in front
of you on the table the first is if you
have a drink or your friend has a drink
that drink put spill and cause liquid
damage to your phone if it isn't water
resistant but the second reason why you
shouldn't leave your phone on the table
is actually a little bit more
interesting in a recent study
experimenters found that people who left
their phones on the table during a
cognitive test performed significantly
worse than people who had their phones
in their pockets and they weren't using
their phones while was on the table and
it didn't matter if it was on silent or
if it was facedown if people had their
smart phones on the table it technically
made them less smart now that sounds
kind of weird right but the reasoning
behind it is we're so wired to check our
phones that even if we resist checking
it it still acts as a distraction it's
like trying to go on a diet and having a
warm chocolate chip cookie sitting on
the table
like sure you might be able to resist it
but it isn't going to help your odds in
the long term alright so those are eight
mistakes that you should avoid making on
your smartphone if there's a mistake
that you think should have made the list
but didn't let me know about it down
below in the comments anyways that is it
for me in this video thank you guys for
watching and as always I'll see you in
the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
