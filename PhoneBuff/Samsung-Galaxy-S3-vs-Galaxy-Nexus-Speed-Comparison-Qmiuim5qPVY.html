phonebook calm and in this video I'm
doing a speed comparison test between
two of Samsung's popular phones on the
left here we have the Samsung Galaxy s3
this is a t-mobile version and on the
right of course we have the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus this is actually the
unlocked HSPA+ version so we're going to
start the speed test starting with the
bloop test I'll turn these guys on at
the same time 1 2 3 hold it for a few
seconds there you go and now while these
guys are loading up I'll let you know
that they're both running on the same
Wi-Fi network I am gonna be doing a few
application speed tests and also a
browser test and I'm actually cleared up
the the browsing history on both phones
before I turned them off so we're gonna
get a nice even test obviously we expect
the galaxies through the wind here on
the left with that 1.5 gigahertz s4
dual-core processor on the right we have
a 1.2 gigahertz OMAP 4460 process from
Texas Instruments so as you see the boot
up test is already done on the s3 also
notable the s3 has 2 gigabytes of RAM on
the US version and the Galaxy Nexus of
course has 1 gig so like I said we
expect the guy on the left to win but
always nice to see you know how big of a
difference it is between the two
this guy was released in December at
least here in America and this guy was
obviously released in June so galaxy is
our galaxy s3 is done Galaxy Nexus just
finished up right now so I'll go and
unlock these guys so unlock this guy and
this guy and they can see the widgets
still loading up I have the same wit
just loaded up just DF quick quick
toggles and weather widget on both
phones so nice and even well go ahead
and start the first application test and
that will be let's do a Flixster so
little Flixster on both 1 2 3 and you
can see the s3 is done and followed by
the Galaxy Nexus so obviously that test
is a win for the s3 and I'll go ahead
and let the apps run in the background
so you can see on here they're running
right here and running right here
because you know Android is a
multitasking OS so we're go and see how
it performs obviously that's gonna give
a big advantage to the 2 gigabytes
channel of so
speed will be the score Center apps so
one two three and again the galaxy s3
finished up first Galaxy Nexus is still
going and there you go now it finished
so that was a quite a notable difference
right there go ahead and hit home on
both and we'll go to you next app speed
test which is the dictionary app so one
two three again the galaxy has do
finished up first wasn't that big of a
difference here but you know it was
about half the time that it took for the
Galaxy Nexus so far the score Center
Apple took longest but that takes long
in general so obviously difference will
be more noticeable so the next test I'll
do is the camera app so I've got camera
a shortcut right there got my camera
truck over here so I'll press it at the
same time so one two three and then I go
you can see you've loaded up first on
the galaxy s3 wait at home back out of
here and now we'll go ahead and do a
quadrant standard test just so you guys
can see the benchmark so I got quadrant
standard some world we here on this guy
where'd it go where'd it go there it is
school quadrant
I made a shortcut here on the galaxy s3
so let's tap both of these guys and you
know what actually I'm going to close
the background on are the background
apps for this test so we'll go ahead and
remove all here and on this guy let's
swipe it out definitely like that
feature on the s3 to be able to do all
once so go ahead and press run benchmark
and now what I'll do is I'll just go
ahead and like fast-forward this part of
the video and come back to it as soon as
it's done
cs3 is done you can see on the Left
we've gotten fast forward for the Galaxy
Nexus
all right so there you go both bones are
done so let's go ahead and yes on both
yes on both guys and we'll go ahead and
show you this guy first so you can see
the galaxy next to scored a 2010 on this
test
little bit lower than that normally does
but you know you get a range between
2000 and 2300 usually so that's that
we'll go ahead and look at the test on
here and you can see says your device at
the top four thousand nine hundred fifty
three so almost five thousand probably
could get five thousand off a fresh boot
but definitely impressive obviously you
know more than double the score on the
Galaxy Nexus and you know that was
expected but I wasn't expecting to be
that big so anyway that's that test and
we'll go ahead and hit home out of here
go ahead and close it just because so
close this guy out close this guy out
now let's go to the browser speeds has
probably the most you know applicable
test when it comes to actually speaking
of wheels notice the difference the most
so let's go over to the first site will
be foam buff
all right so one two three
there you go you can see the galaxy s3
loaded up the page we're still not
showing that stun loading but there you
go now it's done and the Galaxy Nexus
followed up right there so both pretty
fast but the galaxy s3 did get the win
there let's go ahead and go to the next
site which will be how we'll just do
nfl.com sounds good to me so nfl.com
alright so one two three again it loaded
up first on the galaxy s3 and now
followed up by the gods Nexus so pretty
big difference there that was just a
mobile site and I did it both load up
the same you know mobile sites so we'll
go ahead and go to the desktop version
so one two three
alright galaxy s3 showed up first it's
done and this guy's still loading up
there you go now it's done so like I
said both are pretty fast browsers but
obviously the galaxy s3 has the edge
think that gives you a pretty good idea
as far as the speed goes for the browser
overall you know it's a unanimous
decision you know the galaxy s3 wins in
the boot up test it wins in the app
speed tests and it wins in the browser
test camera loads up faster and I mean
overall you're gonna get a better
experience on here and that would even
really test heavily with the
multitasking you know you'd have a bunch
more apps open with the extra garam than
you would on the Gauss next but anyway
