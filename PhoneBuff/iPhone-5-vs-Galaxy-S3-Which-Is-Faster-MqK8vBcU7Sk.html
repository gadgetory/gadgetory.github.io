and in this will be doing a speed
comparison test between the Apple iPhone
5 here on the left against the Samsung
Galaxy s3 here on the right to see which
one obviously better performance both
devices are actually off right now so
I'm go ahead and turn them on at the
same time so one two three press and
hold the power button and wait until I
see something and there we go we'll go
ahead and let both of them run up their
respective operating systems and see
which one loads up faster while they're
loading let you know that both are
connected to the same Wi-Fi network and
the browsing history has been wiped on
both just be nice and even test see the
boot up animation on the Samsung Galaxy
s3 looks like the iPhone 5 is done I'll
go ahead and unlock and I could actually
navigate throughout everything right now
so it is definitely done now the galaxy
of three is done go ahead and unlock
here and again everything seems to be
pretty much finished so we'll go ahead
and start with our application speed
test now quick note obviously we're
running different operating systems on
each device we have Android on the right
and iOS on the left the application that
shows are made by the same developers
there's will be some differences in the
way they're written but it's the closest
thing you get to a you know real-world
test to see you know which ones gonna
give you the better performance as far
as you know the apps that you use on a
daily basis so we'll start off with
Flixter and I will go ahead and tap them
at the same time if I can so one two
three
so the splash screen for some iPhone
five and also it loaded first so when
when it comes to boot up goes to the
iPhone 5 will hit box office so one two
three and again the iPhone 5 loaded up
all the pictures little bit faster than
the galaxy s3 did go ahead and tap on a
movie so we'll do a will be an end of
watch so we'll tap on this guy and
seemed a little bit faster than iPhone 5
again but that was really close the
galaxy s3 made a little transition
animation which may be part of the
reason why it seems slower we'll go
ahead and hit home now take note that I
am pressing home so I'm minimizing the
applications on both the iPhone 5 and
iOS multitasks a little bit differently
than the way Android does Android more
or less has it running in the background
where iOS pauses it but I'm going to
take that into account when I actually
am done with all the application you
know test
I'll run them all over again to see if
the multitasking on Android makes a
difference so let's go to the next
application for now which is score
Center and again load it up a little bit
faster on the iPhone 5 Galaxy s3 is done
now so let's go ahead and go from tab to
tab so I'll swipe over again solve the
content first on the iPhone 5 I've got
to add first even on the iPhone 5 and I
felt listings and then MBA scores so
overall the iPhone 5 has been faster in
the first two apps let's go ahead and
look at the third app which is
dictionary this time it looked like it
was a little bit faster than the galaxy
s3 we even got a little pop up but I
moved by a millisecond but about the
same I will go ahead and hit home and
let's go to Instagram and I see I have
no photos upload is go ahead and tap on
this tab right over here and uh pretty
close I think that the image is
populated a little bit faster on the
galaxy s3 and take you know into account
that we're seeing much more content on
the galaxy s3 than we are on the iPhone
5
you know Instagram has been optimized
for that bigger screen so it's running
in a letterbox mode right now
so we're getting a hit home on that go
to Temple Run
so again splash screen first on the
iPhone 5 asked me to sign up for
something I'm going to hit disable for
now we still see the little load up
screen faster even though I had to go
through that pop-up galaxy s3 is still
running and there you go so fast on the
iPhone 5 in this case once again let's
go ahead and go to Google Earth so let's
hop on earth solve first on the iPhone 5
it's zooming in
looks like the galaxy s3 just content
sitting there I don't have it you know
pinpoint on the city this one's loading
up Las Vegas so let's go ahead and type
in New York so New York and we'll do the
same on here
New York hopefully goes in New York City
but you know I'll just type in city just
in case New York City New York City and
we'll hit search the same time 1 2 3
and basically we're going to see which
one actually renders up the image of New
York a little bit faster so looks like
the galaxy s3 is going a little bit
faster on both soon to be down squad and
zoom in so we'll try zoom in at the same
area and then you see the renderings a
little bit faster in the galaxy s3 the
iPhone 5 is just finishing up now
so galaxy s3 I'd have to give it the win
in Google Earth and let's go to messages
this see know how quickly the messaging
app opens up I only have like one
message thread and my galaxy s3 and I
don't think I have any in my iPhone so
tap it and they're about the same so go
ahead and hit home and the more
interesting test probably is going to be
the camera test
now which phone is going to allow you to
capture those Kodak moments better we'll
go ahead and tap camera at the same time
so 1 2 3 and definitely a little bit
faster on the iPhone 5 you know I saw
the viewfinder a little bit quicker so
we'll get at home and like I said it's
going to do in the beginning of my run
all the tests in Reverse all the top
will start with Flixter once again and
I'm just gonna go quickly through it and
you know let you guys be the judge of
which one's faster so
so for the most part you guys can see it
seems to be pretty much the same that
one lagged a little bit on Temple Run on
the galaxy s3 but you know the
multitasking doesn't seem to be making a
difference so that's good enough for now
let's go ahead and go to the next step
so first time I just going to close out
all these applications I might remove
all on here and then show you that the
applications are closed I'll go into the
task manager you see zero active
applications on the iPhone 5 I'm just
going to tap on this and exit out of all
these little applications here and now
let's go to the browser the browser
should be you know one of the biggest
indicators as far as overall speed so
we'll type in let's do phonebook comm
first all right 1 2 3 so solve the logo
first here and a little bit more of the
content the pictures and this guy seems
to be a lot done now the galaxy s3 is
done so a little bit faster on the
iPhone 5 note that they do render a
little bit differently you know the
galaxy s3 wasn't showing us anything and
all sudden it showed us everything so
wasn't as slow as it looked
comparatively but let's go ahead and tap
on an article right here and see if it
makes a difference again content a
little bit faster on the iPhone 5 got
the ads and everything
now the Galaxy s3 is done so we'll go
ahead and go to another website we'll do
New York Times all right 1 2 3 again a
little bit faster on the iPhone 5 iPhone
5 is done Galaxy s3 is still going and
now it's done so let's go ahead and tap
on an article over here we'll do this
one right here 1 2 3 again we're seeing
the content a little bit faster on the
iPhone 5 and it's done looks like this
one went to like a mobile version where
this one stay on our desktop it's still
loaded faster so that gives you a pretty
good idea as far as that let's do one
more website will do engadget.com
alright one two three and up even this
little pop-up seem to be a little bit
faster than iPhone 5 will it continue to
and gadget it's all the content here
first but that was pretty close in the
actual load time will tap on this LG
intuition review and that was really
close again um I think the galaxy s3
probably loaded up a little bit faster
in this case because I saw the
notification bar up here it had a little
circle going on the iPhone 5 which
indicates that it's still loading up
things in the background let's go ahead
and run a benchmark because obviously
you know these might may not be the
websites you go to and sometimes you
know when it comes to browser tests you
know one one device will perform fast
one or certain website and you know the
other device will perform faster on
another so we'll do a browser benchmark
I accidentally hit a pop-up but we'll go
to a browser mark I so I'm on the
browser mark web page on both will hit
run benchmark at the same time I'll go
ahead and do you guys a favor and skip
through this entire process so that way
you guys can see the score at the end
you
all right so the benchmark test is done
and pretty much how our you know web
test showed the iPhone five disk or
significantly higher than the Galaxy s3
with a score of one hundred ninety
thousand five hundred and fifty four
compared to a score of 110 thousand five
hundred forty two obviously when you run
the test you're gonna get different
results you know sometimes this will be
a little bit higher than 110,000 this
one would be a little bit lower but for
the most part you'll get consistent
results as far as which one is faster or
higher and that seems to be the iPhone 5
definitely you know it's the winner here
in this test even though a lot of tests
were closed in the boot of test 1 2005
most of the application suite tests went
to the iPhone 5 and then the browser
test 1 2005 now I'm not necessarily
saying the iPhone 5 you know hardware is
faster than the galaxy s3s you know I
think a big part of as to do with iOS 6
and the optimizations it has but until
you know the galaxy s3 gets jellybean
which is gonna be in the next couple of
months we'll have to you know say that
iPhone 5 is faster and again I'll be
running the test later so subscribe to
