Davey here from bumble calm and in this
video I'm gonna show you how to add an
email account whether it's a normal
account or a gmail account to your
Android phone so well the first kind of
email account I'll show you to add is a
regular one
it's go ahead and open up your email app
and you can see you'll have a field for
entering your email address and your
password so I'll go ahead and enter it
off-screen and then we'll go on to the
next step
alright so I went ahead and entered in
my email address and my password and
what I'm gonna do now is hit next and
it's you can see it's checking the
outgoing server and there you go now it
gives me the option to check or change
the frequency in which it checks so it's
not a pulsus meaning the phone will
check the server every you know 15
minutes or whatever interval you set it
to to see if you have an email so the
quicker you make it the more battery
life is going to take but of course
you're going to get more frequent
updates and the longer you make it the
more battery you're saved but you won't
be updated as often so depending on how
many emails you get a day you know
choose it based off of that I think
about 30 minutes is fine for me on this
email account and you also have some
other options like saying send email
from this account by default so this is
the email account that you want to use
first or your outgoing emails on your
phone go ahead and check that and then
also you can check if you wanted to be
notified if you want to sync it and of
course we want to down mine up and down
low - mints if you connect it to Wi-Fi
so I'll just go ahead and leave those
checked hit next and you can see again
it's asking me for the name of the email
account so I'll just leave it the same
it's gonna ask for my name I'll leave
that the same as well hit next and there
you go you can see it's syncing up my
email and I am done with that account so
go ahead and close this now and show you
how to add a gmail account so it works
in the same way
open up your Gmail app so I really have
one email account on here so it works a
little bit differently than it would on
your phone if you have no email account
but the way you gonna do it is press
menu and then go over to settings and
then hit add account right over here
add account and you can see it's asking
you to sign in to your Google account so
let's go ahead and type in my username
and password again off screen and I'll
get right back alright so I went ahead
and typed in my username and password
again
this time when I hit sign in and you see
saying it's gonna take a few minutes
there you go just asked me to join
Google+ I'm just not now for now and
it's asked me what I want to sing so say
I don't want to sync my browser and my
calendar of contacts I just want the
email I can just uncheck whatever ones I
want or don't want hit next and there
you go it's been added to my iPhone and
that's pretty much it you see I'm
getting notifications for my emails on
that yahoo account decided all right
anyway that's pretty much it from in
this video thank you for watching it and
don't feed a visit for calm more cell
phone use reviews and how to's thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
