bumble calm and in this video I'm gonna
show you how to add an email account
whether it's a normal account or a gmail
account to your Android phone so well
the first kind of email account I'll
show you how to add is a regular one
it's go ahead and open up your email app
and you can see you'll have a field for
entering your email address and your
password so I'll go ahead and enter it
off-screen and then we'll go along to
the next step
alright so went ahead and entered in my
email address and my password and what
I'm gonna do now is hit next and it's
you can see it's checking the outgoing
server and there you go now it gives me
the option to check or change the
frequency in which it checks so it's not
a pulses meaning the phone will check
the server every you know 15 minutes or
whatever interval you set it to to see
if you have an email so they'll quickly
make it the more battery life is gonna
take but of course you're gonna get more
frequent updates and the longer you make
it the more battery you're saved but you
won't be updated as often so depending
on how many emails you get a day you
know choose it based off of that I think
about 30 minutes is fine for me on this
email account and you also have some
other options like saying send email
from this account by default so if this
is the email account that you want to
use first or your outgoing emails on
your phone go ahead and check that and
then also you can check if you wanted to
be notified if you want to sync it and
of course we want to down line up the
download attachments if your connect us
to Wi-Fi so let's go ahead and leave
those checked hit next and you can see
again it's asking me for the name of the
email account so I'll just leave it the
same it's gonna ask for my name I was
leave that the same as well hit next and
there you go you can see it's syncing up
my email and I am done with that account
so go ahead and close this now and show
you how to add a gmail account so it
works in the same way
open up your gmail app so I really have
one email account on here so it works a
little bit differently than it would on
your phone if you have no email account
but the way you gonna do it is press
menu and then go over to settings and
then hit add account right over here
hey ID account and you can see it's
asking you to sign in to your Google
account so let's go ahead and type in my
username and password again off screen
and I'll get right back alright so I
went ahead and typed in my username and
password again
and this someone hit sign in and you see
you saying it's gonna take a few minutes
there you go to Sassoon to join Google+
I'm just gonna hit not now for now and
it's asked me what I want to sync so say
I don't want to sync my browser and my
calendar of contacts I just want the
email I get this uncheck whatever once I
want or don't want hit next and there
you go it's been added to my iPhone and
that's pretty much it you see I'm
getting notifications for my emails on
that yahoo account decided all right
anyway that's pretty much it for me in
this video thank you for watching it and
don't forget to visit wombocombo
cellphone news reviews and how to's
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
