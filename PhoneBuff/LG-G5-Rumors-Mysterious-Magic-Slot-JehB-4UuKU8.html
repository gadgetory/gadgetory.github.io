World Congress is just a few weeks away
where it is widely presumed that LG will
announce their new flagship smartphone
and the g5 LG has obviously been
tight-lipped in regards to what this new
flash it will be but there are a bunch
of rumors and leaks online that give us
at least some idea of what LG has been
cooking up the first major change that
will probably be coming to the g5 is an
all-new metal unibody design with what
is being dubbed a magic slot at the
bottom of the phone where you'll not
only be able to access the removable
battery but also be able to connect
things to the phone like a physical
QWERTY keyboard we haven't seen anything
like this done before on a phone so I'm
actually pretty excited to see if this
rumor turns out to be true LG's phones
have always had great displays and the
g5 will probably be no exception with
somewhere between a 5.3 and 5.6 inch
quad HD resolution screen on the g5 and
like to be 10 the g5 is also likely to
have a small secondary screen at the top
of the phone for things like
notifications and alerts pretty much the
whole room rail thinks of the g5 will be
powered by Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 820
with either 3 or 4 gigabytes of RAM and
while I'm kind of hoping that they have
4 gigabytes obviously I don't think 3
gigabytes would be the worst thing the
world considering that the g4 had pretty
good RAM management the battery life on
the g4 wasn't the best despite having a
three thousand million battery and
unfortunately some of the rumors online
are pegging the g5s battery to be even
smaller at 28 hundred milliamps mainly
due to the new design not exactly the
kind of rumor you want to hear but if
true I really hope that LG has some kind
of optimizations in store that will help
the new battery lasts a little bit
longer finally the last major rumor
we're talking about is the new camera or
should I say new cameras only shows a
supposed to g5 prototype housing dual
rear cameras with one of the sensors
being a 16 megapixel sensor and the
other being an 8 megapixel sensor for
better selective focus and a wider 135
degree angle so those are the most
important things we think we know about
the g5 of course these are all just
rumors and speculation at this point and
we'll know for sure soon enough when LG
officially announces the phone later
this month that's a wrap for me in this
video we'll be doing a bunch of fumble
style videos on the g5 when it comes out
so be sure
subscribe to the channel if you haven't
already thank you guys for watching him
I'll see you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
