calm and this video meet comparing
Google Chrome vs. Safari on iOS so we'll
go ahead and do a couple of website load
speed tests I'll go ahead load up phone
Bob calm for our first test
all right so it's worth noting that I
did actually clear out the web browsing
history and cache on both browsers and
also did a fresh boot up on both of
these guys so there's no background
running apps or anything like that so go
ahead and hit go at the same time one
two three and of course they're both
running on the same Wi-Fi network so it
looks like chrome actually finished up
first here followed by a safari so we'll
go ahead and not do a quick you know
multi-touch test so stup inches zoom on
this guy looks nice and smooth we'll do
a double tap test and seems like it
works pretty well let's do it of course
on Safari
we all know how that works for buttery
buttery smooth and double tap works
pretty well too let's go ahead and load
up an article a load of this article
right here it's because it's easy to
click on so one two three and again it
looks like it finished just maybe a
millisecond before on Chrome than it did
on Safari
of course you know there isn't a way to
tell what's going on in the bottom so I
try to scroll in my next test will load
up another article and I'll try to
scroll down to see if all the data is
being loaded up so we'll load up this
Apple Siri versus Samsung S voice and I
will tap it at the same time so one two
three and like I said I'll try to scroll
down and you can see again it did finish
up first on Google Chrome than I did on
Safari
of course Safari also loads up this
reader mode which allows you to tap
reader and read your text like this so
that might be accounting for the
difference let's go ahead and try
another site though because it's a
little bit too close to call right now
so go to nfl.com
and I just pressed a little comm button
right here on the top of the keyboard
and I don't know why but it lags a lot
for me um I usually avoid it but I just
wanted to point that out for you guys so
finally loaded up I'll go ahead and hit
go at the same time so 1 2 3 and again
it's done on Google Chrome and now it's
finished on Safari so so far we it looks
like I mean if you're gonna have to
point one to be faster outstate Google
Chrome let's go ahead and see the
desktop version hopefully this gives us
a clear winner so one two three all
right again just maybe a millisecond
before Safari Google Google Chrome
actually finished up so it definitely
looks like Google Chrome is the faster
browser we'll go ahead and just tap on
this article right here just to see if
we get you know get one more result
under the belt so we keep you know for
sure say Google Chrome's faster yep it
finished first again and it definitely
looks to be the faster browser because
it's a browser only video I'm just gonna
go ahead and go to another site let's go
to Yahoo you know the more results we
have the better so let's go to yahoo.com
this time I'm gonna avoid pressing that
little comm button up there so one two
three and again you can see this little
pop up for the current location actually
came up you know maybe a second or so
before it did on Safari so that pretty
much gives me the answer I mean what I
was looking for Google Chrome definitely
seems to be faster than it is on Safari
so anyway it's it for me in this video
hopefully this gives you a better ideas
for us you know the web browsing
