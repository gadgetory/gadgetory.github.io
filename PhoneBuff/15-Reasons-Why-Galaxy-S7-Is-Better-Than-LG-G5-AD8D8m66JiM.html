s7 and LG g5 are two great phones that
do a lot of the same things so in this
two-part Bumble of style video series
we're going to be looking at the
differences and reasons why one phone
can be considered better than the other
let's jump right in reason number one
ip68 water and dust resistance with the
s7 you don't have to worry about
accidental spills and can even clean
your phone after using it with dirty
hands two wireless charging built-in
wireless charging not only lets you
change your phone on any charging pad
but can also help lessen the wear and
tear on the charging port three multi
window multitasking use two apps on the
screen at the same time with many apps
supporting the multi window feature for
one-handed operation triple pressing the
home button will shrink the screen
making it a whole lot easier to use with
one hand
number five ultra power saving mode
going a step beyond the standard saver
mode ultra power saving basically
transforms your smartphone into a dumb
phone turning what would be hours of
battery life into days 6 dedicated heart
rate sensor using this sensor you can
easily track your heart rate with the
included s health app 7 samsung pick
Samsung pay works almost anywhere that
accepts credit cards compared to Android
pay on the g5 which only works at
terminals with NFC eight physical
buttons a physical home button with
capacitive back and recent keys makes
backing out of apps one-step quicker
without taking up any precious screen
real estate nine-game tools from walking
the capacitive buttons to recording
gameplay this feature takes gaming on
the s7 to the next level
number 10 SOS messages a triple press of
the power button can automatically send
emergency contacts and alert with your
GPS location photos from the front and
rear cameras along with a short audio
recording 11 smart stay this feature
uses the front facing camera to prevent
the phone's display from turning off
while you're looking at it 12 smart
alert when you have an unread mess
the SN will vibrate when you pick it up
letting you know about it without you
actually having to look at the screen 13
better low-light photos the lower f-stop
and larger pixels on the SMS camera
gives you better looking photos in
low-light 14 better display both phones
have great displays but the s Evans is
arguably the best display out there with
rich colors deep blacks and the ability
to change the screen mode to your liking
and finally reason number 15 easier to
hold the s7 is both shorter and narrower
than the g5 making it easier to hold and
use with one hand okay so those were
some of the best reasons why the s7 can
be considered better than the g5 but
again the word better is subjective so
if you haven't already be sure to check
out the g5 s video which will be
annotated somewhere here on the screen
and linked for you down below in the
