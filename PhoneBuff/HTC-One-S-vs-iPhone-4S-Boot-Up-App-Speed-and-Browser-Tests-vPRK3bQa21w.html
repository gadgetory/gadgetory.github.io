com and in this video and we're doing a
speed comparison test between the iphone
4s here on the left and the HTC one s
here on the right so this guy has the a5
dual-core processor at a hundred
megahertz and this guy is the 1.5
gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon s4
processor obviously these are two
different devices but in two different
os's but I just want to go ahead and
test it anyway to see you know what
consumers are what you will experience
with these device so the first test is
the boot up test I'll go ahead and press
and hold the power button at the same
time on both devices so one two three
and I'll hold it for a few seconds let
go and they're off so as you can see the
HTC One S screen doesn't turn on right
away when you press it like the iphones
does but you know rest assured I did
press the buttons at the same exact time
so you know don't think I press the
iphones before p1s anyways let's go
ahead and see which one loads up the
fastest
alright so looks like the iPhone
finished up gives me the lock screen I'm
going to unlock it and you can see I
could actually use the phone so
definitely the winner of this test the
1s is still loading showing us the
wallpaper now and the lock screen should
come up in just a second or two all
right there it is this unlock it you
still see it's loading up those widgets
and the apps on the home screen and now
anyway like I said there are two
different os's the code is different
written differently but you know this is
more of a matter of seeing you know what
you will actually experience you know I
don't really care about you know what
with one app or one phone multitask like
Android wear the iphone pauses in the
background I mean yes advantage for
Android but at the same time you know
most consumers aren't going to be aware
of that so I'm just trying to really see
you know which one is going to feel the
fastest so with that says go and start
our first test will do score center arm
will load up at the same time so load up
get score center on here I'm just let
you guys know I do have the phones on
the same Wi-Fi network so we're getting
as even as a test as we could get you
can see there's no background apps open
up well I guess maps open up in here
I'll go ahead and close out anything any
recent apps from the iphones history and
we'll go ahead and open up score center
at the same exact time so one two three
and in this test you can see that the
iphone did beat out the 1s I'm loaded up
first we'll go ahead and close it out so
we'll give the win for that app to the
iphone like close right here let's close
this guy out from the background just in
case and over here let's go ahead and
close it out so that way there's nothing
running in the background we'll go to
the next appt speed test which is
flixster so let me find flixster on here
there it is alright so hit him with the
same exact time one two three and this
loaded and advertisement up so wasn't
really I wasn't really able to see which
one load it up first i'll go ahead and
actually try it one more time so i'll go
ahead and close it out and i'll close it
out of the iphone so
close this guy out all right go right
back to the app shortcuts and we'll try
it one more time one two three all right
so as you can see the iphone beat out
the 1s in this test not by much looks
like the first time that one actually
beat out the iphone so you know what I
just want to be sure that I'm claiming
the right one as the winner will say
their 101 right now and I'll close up
scorecentre or I'm sorry flixster on
each phone one more time and we'll open
it up one more time see if we get easy
to tell winter so we'll go ahead and
load up flicks for one last time all
right so yeah the iphone is definitely
the winner of this app speed test so
we'll go ahead and close these guys out
close them out from the background all
right all right and let's do that last
appt speed test which is google earth
and i'll go ahead and tap it at the same
time so one two three so looks like the
1s actually showed up google earth first
and it's actually loading it up much
faster than the iphone 4s is so in this
case the win goes to the 1s you could
also see the iphone still loading up in
the notification bar so i'll go ahead
and zoom in and out just going to show
you how smooth the zoom feature is or
the pinch to zoom is on the 1s and then
i'll do it on the iphone 4s and I mean
honestly both are really smooth so you
guys can be the judge of which one is
better in that department I'll go ahead
and close these guys out again and close
it out on the 1's now I'll go ahead and
start up the browser test because this
is really the one I'm interested in I'm
sure you guys are interested in as well
I clear out the history and cache on
both devices so we're gonna get a nice
even test again we're on the same Wi-Fi
network so for the first website will
load up phone buff calm on each device
so phone buff calm on here and fumble
calm one here
alright so hit go at the same time so
one two three and they're really close
right now and the 1s is done now the
iphones done so the 1s actually beats
the iphone 4s in this initial test will
load up an article so we can be sure for
phone buff so let's have this article
right here one two three and again both
devices are off the one that's finished
maybe a millisecond before the iphone 4s
its overall on phone buff the one ss
faster but let's go to another site
because you know they load up you get
different results sometimes with
different sites will go to NFL com and
will do NFL com one this guy and will
tap go at the same time so one two three
and it looks like the one s has a lead
on the iphone 4s and it's done loading
now the iphone 4s downloading so again
the winner of this browser test is the
iphone 4 i'm sorry the HTC one s let's
tap desktop at the same time so we can
see the full version of the site so one
two three and i'll go ahead and zoom
this guy out while it's loading and you
can see the iphone 4s actually finished
before the one has did in this case so
so far i would say is two to one let's
load up an article on here so load up
this first one the one s is done and the
iphone 4s still going so their day about
out say actually over all the 1s beat
out the iphone 4s when it comes to the
NFL site and for our final site will go
to yahoo com so yahoo com one here and
yahoo com on here and hit go at the same
time so one two three and again the one
s looks like it finished before the
iphone 4s but let's load up the full
site so we could get up you know our
get a better idea as far as which one's
the king of browsing so hit desktop at
the same time one two three and again
the one has finished a second before the
iphone 4s state as far as the bar goes
and you can see that the notification
bar is still going for the iphone 4s so
again I'll give the win to the HTC One S
in this category will load up an article
so we'll load up I will do this article
right over here so let me zoom in on
here and we'll tap at the same time
actually all right we'll tap this
article 1 2 3 and the 1s is done and now
the iphone 4s is done so you get the
picture on the 1's is definitely faster
than the iphone 4s is when it comes to
the browser so overall you know like i
said the bootup test the iphone 4s Pete
out the HTC One S the app test was close
Google Earth will actually loaded up
fashion of 1s but these other two loaded
up faster on the iphone 4s and then the
browser actually was faster you know
unanimous unanimously on the HTC One S
than it was on the iphone 4s so mixed
results overall I'd have to say that you
know the iphone or I'm sorry the HTC One
S feels like the bastards own of the two
but you know obviously going to get
great results with either one so that's
