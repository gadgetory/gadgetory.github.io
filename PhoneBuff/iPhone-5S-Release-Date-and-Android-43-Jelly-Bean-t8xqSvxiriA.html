the very first episode of fumble q and
A's the show where you can ask me just
about anything you want related or
unrelated to mobile technology and where
I get a chance to ask you guys that's
right you a couple of weekly questions
via polls on our Facebook fan page you
can be part of the weekly polls by
liking us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino
Hamza f or HMG a app asks what new
features you want to see in android
jellybean 4.3 well given that google
just announced android 4.3 i can't
really go over a wish list since it
already exists but i will talk about
what's new in Android 4.3 just a little
bit and hopefully that'll make up for it
so android 4.3 is still sticking with
the jellybean name which has now carried
over since 4.1 so no key lime pie just
yet which right off the bat tells you
that this is just an incremental update
meaning that there won't really be
anything that will jump out are you but
there were definitely some nice new
features added like t9 dowling which by
the way would have definitely been on my
wish list for sure there's now
restricted profile so you can limit
access to certain absent content opengl
was updated to 3.0 which should help
improve the performance of high-end
graphics virtual surround sound was
added and will be supported on the new
Nexus 7 and finally there's now support
for Bluetooth Low Energy which will let
you connect various Bluetooth
accessories without draining your
battery too much I know it wasn't quite
a wish list but hopefully that'll do
yoni Miri asks what's your guess on when
the iphone 6 will be released july 2014
but if you're talking about the iphone
5s i'd say somewhere between late august
and early October Apple typically sticks
to about a one-year product cycle with
the iphone and considering that the
iphone 5 was released last September is
due any time now barring any kind of
manufacturing delays James asks what's
your favorite ice cream well trying to
keep a healthy lifestyle and all I don't
always eat ice cream but when I do it's
cookies and cream Sebastian Valencia
asks what was your first phone okay so
I'll take this is a two-part question my
first cell phone was the Motorola v 188
I got it when I was 16 years old and
given that was my first cell phone I was
actually pretty happy with it until of
course it started giving me static out
of the earpiece which eventually led to
this vicious cycle refurbished
replacement phones where the new phone
wouldn't necessarily have the same issue
but usually it have an entirely
different issue which sort of just drove
me crazy and led me to getting my second
phone after two years so I waited out my
contract and this is actually my first
smartphone in the HTC MDA or otherwise
known as the HTC mogul sure when you
look at him now is just a big bulky slow
and outdated paperweight but I remember
when I first got it I was just amazed at
all the different things I could do with
it having windows mobile which looked
just like windows XP made to fit on a
smaller screen size was just
mind-blowing to me needless to say that
bone was probably the reason that I got
so into mobile technology with all the
unlocking and overclocking I did with it
and unfortunately that euphoria that I
have that phone only lasted about two
months because my dog ended up biting
that phone but yeah thank God for
insurance I asked you via fumbles
facebook poll well phone do you guys
think is the best right now and the
majority of you at forty-three percent
voted for the samsung galaxy s4 coming
at second place twenty-seven percent of
those who voted said they thought the
HTC One was the best just under ten
percent of you voted for the almost one
year old iphone 5 which is pretty
impressive at to say and about seven
percent voted for one of the Lumia 920's
well there was the 920 the 928 or the
925 do you agree or disagree with the
polls results let me know down in the
comments below alright that's it for me
