cool new feature on the Galaxy Note 7 is
the phone's ability to scale its native
2k resolution all the way down to either
1080p like on d1 + 3 or even 720p like
on the iPhone 6s
now obviously Samsung's main intention
with this feature is to help improve
battery life as more pixels leads to
more power consumption so by lowering
the resolution in theory you should be
able to save yourself some juice that's
why it's under the power sitting mode in
these settings however what's
interesting is you have the ability to
customize this mode now and you could
actually lower the resolution while not
affecting the CPU performance so you
leave the CPU unaffected but you do
lower the resolution which begs the
question well the 720p note 7 perform
better than the note 7 at the regular 2k
resolution well that is exactly what
we're going to be testing here in this
video we're gonna be seeing whether or
not the low resolution actually makes a
difference and if so how much but before
we get into it I want to give a big
shout-out to Braintree payments for
making this video possible so developing
your own mobile app can be complex but
integrating your own payment option
doesn't have to be with Braintree your
business can accept nearly every type of
payment from any device with just one
integration everything from pay cells to
PayPal to Android pay or whatever new
payment option comes next
Braintree is simple flexible SDKs make
your job and your payments easier
learn more at Braintree payments comm /
Bombo all right let's get right into it
all right so on your left you have the
Galaxy Note 7 running at its native 2k
resolution and on your right is the note
7 scaled down to 720p so in the first
row of system apps there is no
separation between the two with both
phones performing almost identically and
so far here in the second row the phones
look like mirror images of each other
with each phone loading up subway
surfers at pretty much the same exact
rate so somewhat surprising results as
you'd expect them to be at least some
differences when loading up
but we'll see what happens here in Angry
Birds and yeah again the lower
resolution at least the way Samsung has
implemented it here has a made a
difference yet as both won't start
working on smash it it looks like these
720p note 7 has actually pulled ahead
and moves on to Photoshop mix so there
you go there's the first app that the
lower resolution has seemed to load
faster but it wasn't by much as the 2k
note 7 is right behind the 720p note 7
with both phones struggling here to load
up Photoshop mix so we'll see if these
720p note 7 could add onto its lead that
it gained from smash it and know the
opposite actually happens with the 2k
note 7 finishing 1st and moving on to
lab Civ so very mixed results thus far
as both will start working on creating a
time-lapse from the same exact video
file now I don't expect either phone to
have different results in this app as
the display resolution most likely won't
have an impact on processing the
time-lapses frames and yeah from the
looks of it both are rendering the file
at an identical rate with the 2k note 7
remaining only slightly ahead thanks to
it starting a bit earlier so at this
point I think it's somewhat safe to say
that a lower display resolution at least
the way samsung has implemented it here
doesn't make too much of a difference
when it comes to the speed test honestly
I was expecting the biggest difference
to happen in the gaming row as that's
usually where a higher resolution taxes
the GPU but I see I saw it didn't seem
to matter all that much of course which
is quickly launched and jumped into the
games and didn't actually play them
where a lower resolution would have
likely made a bigger difference but
either way when it comes to overall
performance the lower resolution
settings on the note 7 doesn't seem to
make much of a difference the 2k note 7
finishes the first stop at the time of 2
minutes and 2 seconds with the 720p
notes I've been finishing one second
later with the time of two minutes and
three seconds so obviously not enough of
a difference with either to call one
faster or slower it just looks like the
note 7 performs the same regardless of
what you set the resolution to but
nonetheless if this is an accurate
indication of how a natively lower
resolution phone would perform then the
idea of a lower resolution being an
advantage is obviously wrong but on the
other hand it might just be that
Samsung's
implementation is not an accurate
indication as technically those extra
pixels are still there whereas on a
natively lower resolution phone they
aren't let me know what you guys think
it is down below in the comments but
with both bones finishing the second lap
within one second of each other again
that is it for me in this video thank
you guys for watching and as always I'll
see you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
