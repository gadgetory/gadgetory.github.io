calm and in this video I'm comparing the
samsung galaxy note on AT&amp;amp;T against the
unlock samsung galaxy nexus so i'm just
going to be doing a speed comparison
test comparing the boot of times in the
devices how long it takes to load up a
couple of apps the web browser I'll do a
quadrant benchmark as well and a few
other tests just to kind of give you
guys better idea as far as which one is
the faster phone this guy has a 1.5
gigahertz Snapdragon s3 processor 1 gig
ram this guy has a 1.2 gigahertz TI OMAP
for 460 with one gig of ram so of course
you can't just look at the spreadsheet
you have to Testament in the real world
and that's what we're going to do right
here so go ahead and turn on both
devices at the same time so one two
three and I'll let go and I'll let's go
ahead and watch these two devices power
up and see which one turns on the
fastest
alright so the samsung galaxy note on
the left showed the lock screen first
you can still tell it's loading up some
of the background scans for the SD card
but I could unlock the phone so let me
unlock that guy so you can see it's
still a little bit Lykke because it's
still loading up things in the
background but we'll do the same thing
with the Galaxy Nexus now and you see
this one's a little laggy to its
reloading the home screens that unlock
it a little fast so for this test we're
just going to go ahead and give the win
to the Galaxy Note because this drop the
lock screen first and I was able to get
into the phone a little bit faster than
on the Galaxy Nexus so that's a win for
the galaxy note the first test that i'll
do is a few app test app speed test so a
little flixster on each phone so i'll
hit them at the same time and just let
you guys know they are both on the same
Wi-Fi network so we'll go ahead and hit
flixster and in this case the galaxy
note beat out the Galaxy Nexus so that's
that for that test will load up
scorecenter next just to get a better
idea so scorecenter and again the galaxy
note beat out the Galaxy Nexus so we'll
go ahead and go on to the next test
which is loading up dictionary so a lot
of the dictionary app and once again the
Galaxy Note II out the Galaxy Nexus so
obviously the 1.5 gear processor seems
to be doing what you'd expect it to do
on the spec sheet and that's beating out
the 1.2 TI OMAP but we'll go ahead and
run another test so actually i'm going
to do is close up these apps really
quick so close out the apps that are
running on here and we'll just close
these guys out really quick and we'll
load up now a quadrant standard
benchmark like i said so let me find
quadrant here and here where's quadrant
there it is all right so is open them up
and i'll go ahead and run the test and
obviously
I don't want to show you guys the whole
you know benchmark because that does
take a while so I'll just pause the
video and I'll skip to you when the
results are in so let's go ahead and
press them at the same time and like i
said i'll pause the video and continue
once they're done alright so both
benchmarks are done I was going to hit
yes on both and we'll get the scores so
on the galaxy note is scored a 2039 so
let me bring that up close to the camera
so you can see 2039 and on the Galaxy
Nexus pretty close but a little bit less
at 2004 so again the winner of this test
is the Galaxy Note so it speed it out
and the bootup test the app speed test
and now the quadrant benchmark so far so
it's three now we'll go ahead and run
our next test which is the google earth
test so this is more or less testing the
GPU on each phone because we'll be
loading up 3d graphics so excuse me on
that let me quote let me go ahead and
close out actually the apps that are
running in the background so close these
two out we're going to let Google Earth
to the same time on both phones so let
me find it on here alright so earth and
earth and we'll press at the same time
getting to load it up faster on the
galaxy note which seems to be the theme
now um both are set to my location let's
go ahead and load up Las Vegas so hit
search on each phone las vegas legacy is
early in the history on each guy and
what i'm going to be doing is loading up
the 3d buildings on each phone too and
I'm you pinching in and out just a kind
of test to GPU to see how well it's able
to handle the 3d graphics in Google
Earth to test GP that comes with these
processors so i'll get i'll go ahead and
now pause the video for about a minute
to let him finish uploading the
buildings and then i will go ahead and
run the test alright so we went ahead
and let both devices load up for about a
minute or so so we'll go ahead and test
the galaxy note first so i'll just go
ahead and pinch in and out and i try to
pay attention to how smoothly or laggy
each device is when
zooming in and out so i'll go ahead and
zoom in on this particular building so
you can see it did stutter a little bit
and it usually gets better as i zoom in
and out as it builds some cash for the
or what it's loading up and now let's go
ahead and do a 360 type of you so try to
rotate around let's take a look at the
building go while I'm doing it so let's
go ahead and do a 360 turn and now
basically you see it's like it looks
like frame by frame it's showing you the
3d buildings it's not really fluid it is
sort of choppy I'll go ahead and press
home and you can see it has to reload my
home screen with my widgets and whatnot
so I'll go ahead and load up the Galaxy
Nexus now and I will test this guy so
again will this zoom in and zoom out so
zoom in zoom out and again will do the
same thing with this guy and do a 3d or
a three or a 360 turn on this guy so go
ahead and zoom in a little bit let's
look up at the building a little all
right so 360 spin and um you know this
one is also not necessarily the
smoothest but I do have to say that it
definitely looks a lot smoother than it
does on the galaxy note and I'll go
ahead and press home and this guy as
well has to load up everything up in the
background again so both phones were the
same there but the Gaussian exes seem do
you handle the 3d buildings a bit better
than did the galaxy note so we're
actually give the Galaxy Nexus its first
win in that category and so now it's
three two one and we'll go ahead and go
on to the next test which is the browser
test so go ahead and load up the stock
browser on each device so let me go in
here and load up the browser so let's go
ahead and click on the same time
actually first of all I'm gonna do is
close up the google earth app already
closed down here
and close it out on here all right so
we'll go ahead and load up the stock
browser so one two three and as you can
see it loaded up a bit faster on the
Galaxy Note so i'll go ahead and now run
a few tests all right so i went ahead
and cleared up the browser history and
cache on both of these devices so i'll
go ahead and load up the first test i'll
just go to nfl.com on each device so
nfl.com on here and nfl.com on here and
i'll hit go at the same time so one two
three and now let's go ahead and see
which one loads up the fastest so they
were very close right here but it looked
like the Galaxy Nexus actually beat out
the galaxy note on this test will go
ahead and scroll down to the bottom and
that will load up the full version of
these sites so we'll go and hit desktop
at the same time one two three and you
can see the Galaxy Nexus has a lead on
the Galaxy Note right now and I'll let
you know as soon as one of those done
there you go so the Galaxy Nexus
finished the galaxy note is still
loading so obviously the winner of this
test again is the Galaxy Nexus we're
going to let load up on another website
will load up yahoo com so both the
mobile site and the full site on each
device so yahoo com yahoo com alright so
wait go at the same time one two three
and again you can see the Galaxy Nexus
is done loading the full site and the
galaxy note is still loading the mobile
site so kind of mess up on that test but
still kind of shows you the result that
we're looking for the Galaxy Nexus is
definitely faster I made a little of the
full website and basically the same
amount of time it takes a lot of the
mobile site on this guy and from the
other tests that I've done just by using
two devices I'll see that this guy's
browser is definitely faster but I think
that's more of a result of the ice cream
sandwich that's on the Galaxy Nexus then
is on the galaxy note with Jean
gingerbread
um once this guy gets the update i'll
redo the test and we'll see if the
results are the same or different but
for now overall I'd say the faster phone
is the Galaxy Note even though um the
Galaxy Nexus did beat out the galaxy
note when it came to a GPU performance
so if you're looking for a phone that
has a better graphics processor the
Galaxy Nexus is definitely going to be
the one that gives it four to you
otherwise in all other regards it seems
like the 1.5 gb snapdragon processor on
the galaxy note outperforms the Galaxy
Nexus and I only imagine once the galaxy
note gets ice cream sandwich we'll see
even more performance in Hanson's on
this guy but that's pretty much it for
