com and in this video i'm gonna show you
how i protect my samsung galaxy nexus so
if you follow the blog you know that
this is the phone that i actually used
on a daily basis all the other phones
are just test phones or review units
anyway as you can see you have a case on
here i also have a screen cover so just
want to show you our taco bottom a
little bit so first thing is the case
it's the distronic case i got this from
amazon i forget how much i gotta fire i
think it was like 12 bucks something
like that anyway this is the second
revision of the case they're also with
the revision now and the difference is
the volume buttons are cut out isaac see
mine aren't cut out they just have
little indentions to let you know for
the volume up and down but as you can
see all the holes in here pretty much
cover a certain aspects of the phone for
example you have your power button
exposed you have the little charging
dock thing exposed you have your micro
USB your microphone right over here and
of course your headphone jack exposed on
this side again like I said the volume
keys you can see on the new version the
case this is exposed as well and then at
the back you have your second microphone
exposed and of course your camera on the
back now this is actually a matte black
version it's a TPU gel type case it's
the matte black version you can see have
some scratches on here and obviously
that's what the use have had the phone
for a really long time now so like I
think about five months about it so
obviously expect there to be some
scratches but the phone itself is
perfectly protected forward to drop the
phone face front like this it the screen
would be pretty much protected because
you can see the case is lifted a little
bit so when it falls it's going to hit
the edges of the case not the actual
screen itself but just the case does or
my keys get into my pocket I've got a
screen protector it's the zagg screen
protector um I wonder if this logo will
show up on camera probably not there's a
little zag logo right here anyway on
this is that invisishield type
screen cover and you have to put it on
with a wet application and you squeeze
you out the water but I put it on and
this is probably one of the best screen
covers I've had works really well on the
Galaxy Nexus works well with the
Distronic case I really love it you kind
of see you kind of have that those
little ripples in the screen and you
know some people don't like it some
people like it I really don't mind it
doesn't reduce the quality of the screen
in any way um so I definitely recommend
it and you know we'll do the key scratch
test and I'll kind of show you so here's
the screen right now I'll go ahead and
get my keys scratch my phone screen and
let's see if anything shows up so you
can't really see anything sometimes
you'll see some smudges on the screen
you just wipe it off and sometimes I
even you know put a little bit spit on
my finger and wipe it off and I'll wipe
it off my t-shirt and it looks like new
so anyway that's a quick video showing
you how I protect my galaxy nexus if you
have a Galaxy Nexus I'd recommend for
sure the invisishield screen protector
the distronic case for looking for that
matte black look I definitely love it
it's sleek and kind of goes with the
color scheme of the phone anyway all
