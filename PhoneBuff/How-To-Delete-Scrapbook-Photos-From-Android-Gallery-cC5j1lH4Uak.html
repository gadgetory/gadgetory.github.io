to get rid of an annoying problem that I
had on my Galaxy Nexus after I installed
Google+ and I'm sure a lot of you guys

Google+ and that's the empty scrapbooks
or scrapbook photos album that shows up
in your gallery I mean no matter what I
do I can't get it off my phone I try to
delete it highlight it doesn't give me
an option to delete it so definitely you
get annoying and I'll show you how to
get rid of it you do have to do it
through the internet so I'm just going
to go ahead and jump on my computer to
show you how to do it but you could do
on your phone as well alright so the
first thing you'll want to do is open up
your web browser and then from here go
to Picasa Web google.com so it's Picasa

going to be taken to your web Oh
so of course you're not logged in do
that I already logged in so I'll go
ahead and show you how to delete the
album so what you're gonna do is I found
scrapbook photos right here in my list
of album I'm gonna go ahead and click on
it
and I'm gonna hit actions right over
here and then hit delete albums do
albums are you sure I say yes and it's
gone so I'll go ahead and show you on my
phone to see if it actually disappeared
there alright so now that you've done
that on your computer go ahead and go to
your gallery and you can see mine still
shows up the scrapbook photos but I'm
just going to hit menu and then refresh
