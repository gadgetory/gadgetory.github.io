Note 7 and the s7 edge have more in
common than just the number in their
names both phones have the same
processor the same amount of RAM the
same 12 megapixel camera the same
resolution and almost the same size
screen and battery yet the note 7 cost
close to $800 more than the s7 edge so
in this video we're going to be looking
at 10 reasons why the note 7 can be
considered better than the a7 edge to
help you decide whether or not it's
actually worth the extra money the jump
right in reason number one better
display while both the note 7 and the s7
edge have amazing displays the note
sevens is technically better it's larger
at 5.7 inches compared to 5.5 which can
make viewing content and watching videos
a bit more enjoyable the display is also
brighter with its maximum brightness
peaking at 1000 nits compared to 855 on
the s7 edge this should translate into
the note 7 being a bit easier to see
when outdoors and in direct sunlight and
thanks to this brighter display the note
7 also supports HDR video which
previously was only available on the
higher-end
4k TVs and projectors but now you can
get the same larger range of the darkest
and brightest colors right on the note 7
however there is a catch true HDR video
is pretty scarce right now as is hard to
find the content with only a few titles
from Amazon video currently supporting
it but luckily the note 7 does come with
a video enhancer mode which kind of
mimics HDR on regular videos like on
YouTube making a noticeable difference
compared to regular video on the s7 edge
finally the note centers display has
better auto brightness as is the first
phone to feature two ambient light
sensors instead of just one with a
sensor on the front and on the back the
note 7 won't get tricked as easily into
dimming the screen by things like a
temporary shadow as the sensor on the
back will detect different lighting from
the sensor on the front letting the
phone get a more accurate sense of the
true lighting conditions rounding to
more durable thanks partly to a having
Gorilla Glass 5 the galaxy note 7
handles drops significantly better
than the s7 with it not only taking less
damage when being dropped on the front
in the back but also being able to
handle much more internal shock with the
surviving 50 drops in our foam buff
style drop test 3 more ergonomic design
the SM edge kind of lives up to its name
with the size of the phone curving over
to a thin metal band creating these
edges that are kind of sharp and not
very comfortable to hold in the hand
thankfully Samsung addresses issue with
the note 7 with perfectly symmetrical
and rounded sides that make holding it
for extended periods a much nicer
experience for Less accidental presses
another issue with the S Evan edges
edges is your fingers and palms can
often accidentally touch the edge of the
screen which can get really annoying
really quickly while the note 7 also has
a dual edge display its curves aren't
anywhere near as pronounced which cuts
down on the accidental presses
significantly giving you the same
benefits of the edge panels without any
of the drawbacks reason number 5 s-pen
alright so the most obvious advantage
the note 7 has over the s7 edge is the
s-pen but it's not just the stylus
itself that makes the note 7 stand out
really it's the software that comes with
the s-pen that makes it special with
awesome features like being able to
translate text on-the-fly to easily
creating a Jif from any non DRM
protected video 6 usable and water while
both the Galaxy Note 7 and the s7 edge
are ip68 water and dust resistance both
phones are completely unresponsive to
the touch of your finger when underwater
but the difference is the note 7 has the
s-pen that we were just talking about
which works just as it does when it's
dry when it's underwater which is great
for switching between your camera app
and apps like snapchat when you're
snorkeling or when you just want to jot
down some notes while you're taking a
bath 7 iris scanner unlike the s7 edge
the galaxy note 7 has an iris scanner in
addition to the fingerprint scanner
which Samsung claims is up to 100 times
more secure now while using a
fingerprint scanner is generally more
convenient having an iris scanner as a
backup security method is nice when your
phone is wet and the fingerprint scanner
can't properly read your finger so again
advantage to the note 7 when the phone
is wet 8 USB type-c the note 7 has a USB
type-c port which in addition to feature
proofing the phone with a new standard
it has a benefit of being reversible so
you can plug in the charger in either
direction which is especially useful
when you're trying to do so in the dark
9 64 gigabytes of base storage
yes the note 7 cost more than the s7
edge but it also comes with more base
internal storage at 64 gigabytes
compared to 32 on the sm and edge which
may in and of itself justify the extra
cost and finally reason number 10 new
software features with the notes have
been being the latest smartphone from
Samsung it benefits from the newest
version of TouchWiz which comes loaded
with a bunch of new software features
there's a new secured older that lets
you password protect not only your
photos and videos but whatever apps and
documents you want as well the always-on
display supports more third-party
notifications compared to the one on the
s7 edge and in general the UI is much
more streamlined with everything being a
bit easier to find now some of these
software features may eventually make
their way onto the SM edge in a future
update while others may not and really
only Samsung knows for sure so for now
these features are exclusive to the note
7 alright so there you have it those are
the top 10 reasons why the note 7 can be
considered better than the Galaxy s7
edge now usually when we do these type
of comparisons here at Bombo this is the
part of the video where I tell you about
the video for the other phone but in
this case since note 7 is basically an
upgraded s7 edge there isn't going to be
another video now that's not to say that
the s7 edge doesn't have its own
advantages
but there are only three that I can
think of the first is obviously that it
cost less the second is it uses a
microUSB port instead of USB type-c so
if you get the SM an edge over the note
seven it can likely save you even more
money by not having to buy all new
accessories and then finally the third
advantage is the pixel density is
technically higher on the SM and edge
due to its slightly smaller screen which
may help a bit when using it with the
gear VR but outside of that the note 7
is the better phone now the question is
is it worth the extra money let me know
what you guys think down below in the
comments were these ten reasons enough
to sell you on the note 7 or will you be
going with the s7 edge instead anyways
that is it for me in this video thank
you guys for watching and as always I'll
see you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
