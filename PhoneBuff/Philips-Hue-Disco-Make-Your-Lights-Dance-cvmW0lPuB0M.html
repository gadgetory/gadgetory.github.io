this episode of appra crap are going to
be taking a look at the huge disco app
which works with the Philips hue lights
now in case you ever heard of Philips
hue already they're Wi-Fi enabled smart
bulbs that let you produce over 16
million colors using your smartphone and
this app is supposed to help take that
experience to the next level so in this
video we're going to take a look at the
three key features this app supposedly
brings to the table feature number one
moves things that lighting designs that
help you set the mood for different
types of environments for example I'm
really hungry
change it hey man look at his Christmas
lights I found I mean you did we should
go another feature number two adaptive
lighting using your phone's microphone
the lights changed based on what it
hears such as stupid David don't press
anything Harlem Globetrotter something's
wrong
feature number three stroke have your
lights flash on and off in a number of
different ways like turning your house
into a rave
the fuck away
fuck never stop on to the brain
or what usually happens after those
parties
that's the sound of money
I do too after messing on this app a
little bit what do you think is it app
or is it crap it's Kurt no it's an app
it's nothing I think that's a greedy
obvious agree um but it isn't perfect
there are a few cons the first of which
is it's not a free app that kind of
sucks right but for what you're getting
I can't complain right and uh I guess
the only other con that I could think of
is it's not necessarily perfect doesn't
switch with the sounds exactly in tune
yeah it kind of goes moreso off of the
peaks you know when it overlaps sounds
is a little little kind of hectic it
doesn't really go with the beat is yeah
exactly but the pros pros I mean you get
to control your house it's a freaking
light show in your house you can't
really what more do you want
I mean you buy you buy lights for this
reason and yet this one does it for you
I think I think it's a different like
the Philips hue app that comes with
lights yeah it lets you control your
lights but this one lets you program you
like you know it actually does something
with you lights it's the first thing I
want to show everybody when they come
into the studio yeah I'll go to my house
it's check this out I can turn my house
into a disco they have a lot of options
here and because you could customize it
yourself it's the world's your oyster
yeah that's your oyster the world's
oyster yeah yeah okay anyways that is it
for us in this video thank you guys for
watching in we'll see you in the very
next episode of app or crap
you think we should go Holly
Oh God - you hurt you hit the fucking
corner in my head ah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
