and in this video my show you how to
enable LED notifications on your iPhone
4 or 4s so obviously there's no
notification light on the front of
iPhone and that's not going to change
with this video but on the back there is
an LED flash and we can actually enable
the sky to flash every time we get an
incoming call our incoming text message
so go ahead and show you how to do that
the way you do it is open up the main
Settings app and then from here scroll
down to where it says general and then
from the general tab go down to where it
says accessibility so it's kind of near
the bottom and then scroll down from
here and under LED flash for alerts to
switch this guide to on and I'm going to
press home out of here and you do have
to actually lock the screen for the
notification to work so I'll go ahead
and lock the screen and then I'll flip
this guy over and do a quick test call
to myself to demonstrate how it works
okay so I'm calling myself and there you
go so you can see the flash sees me go
ahead and hang up on myself really quick
alright so that's for a phone call go
ahead and demonstrate also a text
message so I did lock the screen again
to make sure because it when the screens
on it doesn't actually work so I'll go
ahead and send myself a text message
alright so I went ahead and sent myself
a text message should be getting any
second and there you can see it flashed
like twice uh pretty much with the
vibrate and I got the text message so
that's pretty much how it works
um obviously you know it's preferable to
have on the front but that's the best
that you know it's currently available
anyway that's it from me in this video
