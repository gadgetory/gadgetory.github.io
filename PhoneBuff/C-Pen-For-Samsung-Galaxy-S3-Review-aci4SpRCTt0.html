and this vid opening a short little
review on the c-pen accessory for the
Samsung Galaxy s3 I know a lot of us
three owners out there are kind of
curious about the c-pen wondering how
well it works on the galaxy s3 and also
wondering it feels similar to the s-pen
on the galaxy note so hopefully I can
answer some of those questions here in
this video but first I want to show you
the pen itself at first glance you can
see you know it looks just like your
ordinary pen of course we have the
Samsung logo here on the little clip and
at the tip of course we don't have ink
we have a capacitive stylus and unlike
your ordinary capacitive stylus it's not
you know fat and squishy it's actually
you know rather thin and hard so you
know I can't really square sky in so
it's definitely gonna give me more
precise input than your typical
capacitive stylus let's go ahead and you
know test it on the galaxy s3 so have
s-memo open will open up a new note and
i'll just go ahead and write a little
bit so you guys could kind of see how it
works it's alright
hi there this is the C pen so I don't
know if you guys notice but when I wrote
the hi I mean looks like an N actually I
actually started up at least over here
and that it didn't register and that's
something I've noticed you know since
I've been using it when I'm writing at
an angle like this you know using the
side of the stylus it doesn't register
all the time you kinda have to press a
little bit harder for it to really get
it now if you're going flat on like this
it's pretty good I mean you're never
gonna really have to actually apply some
pressure but when you do go from the
side an angle like this you are gonna
have to so that's something to keep in
mind another thing to keep in mind to
use something that I've noticed is that
sometimes there's a little bit of lag
when you're you know writing
see if I could actually duplicate it
usually you know when I try to do videos
like this I can't for the life of me
duplicate it but hopefully we can so
let's go ahead and write bone buff flown
buff is a phone and Suzy is okay it's
not gonna work anyway you get the idea
you know I mean it does work pretty
well you know definitely a lot more
accurate than your typical stylist I
mean it's look it's a lot harder right
with those see no fat squishy ones I
could definitely feel like you know I
could write you know smaller so if I
wondered right like like that I can you
know something small where you know what
the ordinary style is I have to write at
least like that big so oh there you go
so I don't know if you guys saw that but
when I dotted the eye right over there
it did lag a little bit I'm glad that
happened so anyway yeah so there's
sometimes there's millisecond like I
mean it's not that big of a deal really
but something to keep in mind
nonetheless overall you know I do like
the c-pen and I do feel like it gives
you more precise input when it comes to
a stylus on the galaxy s3 and it's made
specifically for the galaxy s3 I mean so
much so that it doesn't even work with
the capacitive buttons where you know
your typical ordinary stylus does so
that's something you know to keep in
mind as well speaking of you know it
working specifically for the galaxy s3
just go ahead and test it on the Galaxy
Nexus here I mean this is a Samsung
device but as you can see no response
whatsoever from the touchscreen we're on
the you know Galaxy s3 the c-pen works
perfectly fine I mean it's not even just
using an estimate meaning it works you
know everywhere just like you would
think and definitely is really really
accurate so that's something you know I
like kind of weird how it doesn't work
with the capacitive buttons I wish
Samsung we don't would have made it but
I think it's the way they programmed it
to work as far as you know with the
TouchWiz software or with the screen I
mean you get better input as a result
but at the same time you don't get you
know some of the functions of being able
to use the capacitive buttons which
there's something I typically like my
capacitive stylus is you see what else
oh as far as it being like the s-pen you
know it is not I mean if you're coming
from the galaxy note with the s-pen to
the galaxy s3 thing and the C pen is
going to give you the same experience
you know you're gonna be disappointed
because this is a capacitive stylus you
know the s-pen is not the s-pen you know
works on different technology it's
pressure sensitive so you actually you
know push a harder make different kind
of strokes we're over here every single
time you make a stroke it's exactly the
same because the you know the inputs the
same so definitely not as accurate it is
however you know more comfortable to
hold in the hand I mean because it's
like a real pen and you know the size is
actually pretty decent you're not going
to be like cramping
so that's something to keep in mind as
well but anyway that is you know it for
me in this video something I want to say
guys I bought this guy on Amazon for
about $20 so that's how much it costs at
least it cost for me online I could
probably you know get a better deal
somewhere else I don't know but anyway
overall I'd have to say you know I don't
think it's a must-have accessory if we
really want to style this for you Galaxy
s3 then you know I would go for I mean
everybody paying $10 for you no ordinary
capacitive stylus I think it's worth the
worth to fork out an extra $10 to get
the C pen because you know it does offer
you a better experience but at the same
time you're not gonna get that same you
know s-pen experience that you know some
of you guys might be expecting coming
from the Galaxy Note but thank you for
watching the video and if this helped
you a little bit please give me a thumbs
up and subscribe to the channel if you
have not already thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
