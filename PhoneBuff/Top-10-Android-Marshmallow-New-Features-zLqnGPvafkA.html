recently announced the new version of
Android called M we don't know exactly
what dessert the M stands for just yet
my guess is either marshmallow or maybe
Mentos let me know what you guys think
down below in the comments
but after Google i/o and having the
Developer Preview of M installed in my
Nexus 6 I've gotten a pretty good idea
of what I think are the top 10 best new
features so we'll start off with
probably the coolest new feature at
number one in now on tap so if you've
ever used Google now you know just how
smart you can be and with now on tap
Google now is getting even smarter going
way beyond just grabbing information
from Google's own services in Android M
when you tap and hold on the home button
from any app Google now will scan what's
on your screen and give you relevant
information for example if you're in the
messaging app and a friend is talking
about a certain new movie tapping and
holding on the home button will give you
information like show times reviews and
links to related apps like Flixter if
the information you want isn't available
you can always just ask for it for
example if you're listening to a song on
Spotify by Eminem and want to know just
how old mmm is these days you can simply
say ok Google how old is he and Google
now will give you the answer using its
contextual abilities to know that you're
talking about Eminem without you
actually having to say so pretty damn
impressive to doze and pretty much every
new version of Android Google tries to
make battery life better and Android M
is no exception this time around Google
introduced a new feature called doze
which is set to significantly improve a
device in standby battery life by
putting apps into a deeper sleep so
effectively what doze does is give up a
little bit of app freshness during
standby in exchange for a longer battery
life of course doze only activates when
you have your phone or more likely your
tablet just lying there unplugged for
hours at a time
those will detect this idle state by the
lack of significant movement detected by
the motion sensors and will then
restrict app activity down to a bare
minimum
the result at least according to
Google's test is devices running on em
improve their standby battery life by up
to two times which is absolutely huge 3
app
back up whether you getting a new phone
or doing a hard reset eventually you're
going to have to go through the somewhat
tedious process of resetting up
everything on your phone right now
Android tries to help you with this
process by automatically reinstalling
your apps after signing in to Google but
none of your app's data and settings are
actually restored so essentially you're
still kind of starting over from scratch
in Android M however not only will you
have your apps automatically reinstalled
for you you'll also have them more fully
restored with em backing up up to 25
megabytes of data per app obviously you
won't have all your cache backed up so
don't expect things like songs in apps
like Spotify to be included but having
at least important data and settings for
your apps automatically restored is
definitely a nice feature to have for
fingerprint support so we've seen phones
with fingerprint scanners on Android for
a while now but these were always third
party implementations with em Google is
finally baking fingerprint support right
into the OS as long as the phone has a
fingerprint scanner you'll be able to
use it to unlock the device make
payments with Android pay which is
basically Apple pay but on Android
authenticate Play Store app purchases
and use the fingerprint scanner for
third-party apps since Google will be
giving developers access to the scanner
similar to how touch ID works on the
iPhone nothing necessarily mind-blowing
here but some much-needed catching up by
Android 5 app drawer and launcher and M
the app drawer has been updated to where
you now have the ability to search for
an app at the top see your most recently
used apps in the first row below it and
scroll through an alphabetized app list
that together should make finding an app
much easier the widget menu has also
been revamped to neatly organize widgets
by their respective apps and you can
finally uninstall an app directly from
the home screen instead of having to go
through the app drawer settings 6 app
permissions right now on Android when
you try to download an app from the Play
Store you're given a list of things that
the app wants access to like your
contacts location microphone or camera
if you want to give an app access to
even just one of the things on the list
well too bad either you give the app
access to everything that's asking for
or you can't download the app there's
really no in-between but
all of that is about a change with
Android M where you'll be able to
download an app without having to grant
it access to everything at installation
and instead you'll only be asked for
permissions at the first time the app
actually needs them so for example if
you've been using whatsapp and one day
you decide that you want to send a voice
message you'll be asked for access to
your microphone by asking for this
permission at the very moment that the
app needs it you'll have the contacts to
be able to understand why the app wants
the permission and can therefore make a
much more informed decision if you
decide to grant the app access great
you'll be able to use that feature if
you deny the app access obviously you
won't be able to use it but at least
you'll still be able to use the rest of
the app which just wasn't possible on
lollipop er below 7 adoptable storage
phones with SD slots are becoming
somewhat of an endangered species but
with Android M those SD slots are going
to be even more valuable than they are
today with the ability for a phone to
adopt an SD card as internal storage
meaning your high speed SD card will
work pretty much the same way your
internal storage does without any of the
limitations that SD cards have
traditionally had of course SD cards
have to be formatted and encrypted for
this feature to work so you won't be
able to use the SD card and other
devices for security reasons but that's
a cost that I think most people would be
willing to pay for effectively doubling
or even quadrupling their internal
storage 8 direct share Android has been
good about sharing options since day one
making it possible to share content from
one app using another and an M it's only
getting better with direct share with
this new feature
Android M will pick up on your sharing
habits to help reduce the amount of
steps that you need to take in order to
share things for example if you often
share pictures from your gallery via
hangouts to a specific friend Android
will present this option directly from
the share menu to be able to do it in
one click instead of having to press
share and then hang out and then find
your friend from a contact list it's not
a huge feature by any means but it's
actually one I'm really looking forward
to 9 USB type-c it looks like the long
run that micro USB ports have had on
Android is finally coming to an end with
Android M supporting USB type-c
so what will USB type-c bring to the
table
to justify having to throw out all those
extra microUSB cables a lot actually but
the main ones are faster charging a
reversible charging port to make it
easier to plug in in either direction
and two-way charging so not only can you
charge your phone but you can charge
someone else's phone with your phone
turning your phone into somewhat of an
external battery pack 10 web and app
experience so there are actually two
features that improve the web and app
experience in Android M the first is
chrome custom tabs which allows apps to
use a customized chrome tab when a user
clicks on a web link right from within
the app itself giving you the advantages
of chrome like save passwords and
security without having to leave the app
itself and open Chrome separately the
second feature is a blink swear clicking
on a link to a certain URL will
automatically open up the appropriate
app when available for example if you
get an email with the link to a tweet
clicking on the link will automatically
open up the Twitter app without you
actually having to tell the phone to do
so in a pop-up dialog you can turn this
feature off on a per app basis if you
want but for the most part just like
with custom tabs it should make handling
links you encounter on Android a little
bit more seamless so there you have it
those are the top ten best new features
in Android M the recurring theme at
least with most of the new features like
now on tap and direct share is that
Google is trying to make your smart
phone smarter by predicting what you
want before you actually need it making
Android a little bit more convenient to
use
