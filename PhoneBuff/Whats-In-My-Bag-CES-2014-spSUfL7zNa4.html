and I just made it to Vegas late last
night for CES and but I head off to the
show in just a little bit so you guys
want to see anything in particular let
me know on Twitter i'll put the link
right below that like button but before
i go to the show want to make a quick
video tringa is a kind of gear i used to
make the videos they see on these
channels so first thing you'll see here
is google glass my face and oxy i didn't
use this last year at the show but this
year because i have it i am using it in
Swiper no hands-free shooting but I to
apologize for the poor video quality and
audio quality which you're probably
gonna get but anyway it's go ahead and
check out my other gear so on this table
right here is pretty much everything
that I use to make videos and see it's
actually not all that much because this
year we'll see s compared to last year
I'm taking the less is more approach
where I just didn't take the stuff that
I actually need last year i think that
took way too much stuff in it not really
annoying and really heavy so anyways I
will cover the stuff on the table person
and we'll get into the bag first thing
you'll see here is my dell XPS 13 laptop
and actually don't know the model number
for everything here so i'll be putting
links in the description box to amazon
just case you guys are interested but
anyway this is my laptop that i use for
on-the-go editing main reason I like it
is because it's thin it's lights build
quality is nice it's kind of like looks
like a Mac really but anyway that's the
reason I liked it the reason I bought it
i am a windows guy or at least i was
because i did purchase new mac pro so I
will be switching over and probably
getting a new laptop next year but
anyway this laptop is it's decent notice
I has an SSD so you know it's pretty
quick reading and writing and the track
right is good but the drivers kind of
suck honestly and the resolution isn't
as high as I would like it's like 1300 x
768 versus 1080p or something higher
like on the retina display on the mac
pro or macbook pros so i'll probably
upgrading like i said but right now it
gets the job done it doesn't have the
internet ports which unfortunately in
this day and age some hotel like the one
I'm in right now still don't off
Wi-Fi which you know i get it i mean
eagerness faster obviously so i have a
second laptop which is right here is the
sony vaio it's actually my girlfriend's
not mine but it's a regular lot so it's
not an ultrabook has a ethernet port so
i can get those blazing fast three
megabytes speeds anyway back to the
table so that's the laptop will put that
right here this thing right here
technically isn't part of my gear
because I don't really use it to make
videos but because I'm a technology fan
and a lot of guys are I hadn't included
it something I take with me every single
time I travel whether it's for business
or for just fun and that's because it
gives you mobile audio via bluetooth or
auxiliary right here and it's a bose
speaker in honestly think delivers
really really loud and Chris founding
audio and out this little package you
can't really ask for more and that was
something I like to have when you know
just trying to relax especially in Vegas
here you know I am known to have a drink
or two sometimes when I'm in Vegas so
nice to be able to listen to the kind of
meeting like this tripod here is a
manfrotto tripod us actually one of the
first tripods I got and that it's not
really a high-end one it's not one I'd
used for the smooth movements that you
see on the channel I want to make those
pans but it's a pistol grip so it's
really made for just holding the camera
steady and the main reason I took this
one instead of one of my other ones is
because it's small its compact its
lights the other ones are like this long
so definitely got something I want to
carry on and the legs aren't really that
heavy so that is the tripod use now
let's go ahead and get to the main thing
which is you bag so I use like canon bag
again I don't know the model number i'll
link it down in the description but it's
i like it because it's really small has
a little shop here for around the
shoulder and a little handle if you want
to hold it but go ahead and open it up
and i will actually fit all my gear near
which i'm actually kind of proud of
doing because i have a lot of stuff in
here so first thing we look at is the
cameras let's the camera i use for all
my videos that you see on the channel I
got this actually relative by pretty
recently so maybe the last like 10
videos that you've seen I'm using this
camera it's the
in EOS 70d and the main reason I use it
instead of another one is because it has
autofocus kind of like a camcorder so
it's gonna be great for you know when I
go to show being able to look at
everything without having to worry about
focusing things which makes life so much
easier it's like a prosumer camera so
it's not a professional camera you know
it's not like the 6000 cameras that some
youtubers are used but that's why
something I will get in the future but
for right now this one does the job so
something I like anyway I will go into
the rest of the bag so obviously I have
a lens with the DSLR and up this is the
kit lens that came with the 10 and t4 I
that I bought a while ago I got rid of
that when i upgraded to this but the
reason why I'm using this instead of
when my other lenses is because it has a
vocal range or a zoom lens it zoom lens
so you go from 18 millimeters to 135
which is this really good for you know
running gun shooting so that is my
camera now obviously for audio I'm not
going to be using google glass i'll be
using the tascam dr 07 mark to so
something i recently got a little wind
screen on here and seems actually pretty
cool because you have the X Y and a B
configuration so you can kind of record
audio custom to how you want it's
similar to the zoom h1 but it's a little
bit better in my opinion as far as
versatility goes but that is what I use
for you could plug in another microphone
are in here like a road my car whatever
using our lab but that's what i use and
i'm probably be using this a lot for
like just handheld it's great for like
interviews and stuff so next is guess my
headphones these are my bose headphones
i got the bose speaker i got bose
headphones it's actually really old I
got this before I even started making
videos on phone buff and as you can see
they're pretty beat up so probably
upgrading a new feature I don't really
know a lot about headphones so if you
guys any suggestions let me know down in
the description or I've sorry let me
know down in the comments but so far so
good things are pretty portable too so
they fold up like that further on you
got the mouse which you know like I said
that the drivers or the trackpad sucks
on this thing so i use a logitech mouse
here
um not really much to say here I mean
it's just a mouse it works on a lot of
services so pretty good what does its
charger for my iphone wish is a phone
that I carry so here are two phones that
I keep in my bag the iphone 5s and of
course the nexus 5 i'm not going to be
actually using these phones when i'm at
CES mainly I use them for like
comparisons sake up a new phone it's
official see if one of these has it or
maybe just like you know side-by-side
comparisons if I decide to go that route
but it's also good to have a backup the
Nexus 5's probably i'll be using more so
because it takes a regular sim where
this is a nano-sim the 6 micro sim
because my main phone i use is the
galaxy note 3 don't really like TouchWiz
not a fan but it does have a lot of good
features main reason I use this is the
battery life screens amazing cameras
decent like the chem more on the iphone
5s but anyways those are the three
phones i carry on me and that that's it
for what's in here gonna check out
what's on the other side zippers here oh
of course extra battery so got one
battery here for the canon 70d got a1
sabe power like a third-party extra
battery pack it comes with two it's like
30 bucks or seems like that so super
cheap and a really good value for the
canon 70d so that is all that's in there
let's go ahead and check out this zipper
oh I just might charger for my laptop so
like I said I fit everything I mean
that's so it's a lot of stuff you think
about it all into that little bag I'm be
able to carry it wherever I go and get
decent result out of it so anyways that
is pretty much it for me this video so
that's the last I would cover that I'll
go ahead and save by you guys face to
face so anyway I'll follow me on Twitter
like I said hit me up on Twitter let me
know what you want to see a i'll put the
link right below and i'll probably
annotate it somewhere over here sorry if
we're wobbling my head so much with
google glass eye that's we're talking
suave my head anyways thank you for
watching the video guys and see you guys
in the very next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
