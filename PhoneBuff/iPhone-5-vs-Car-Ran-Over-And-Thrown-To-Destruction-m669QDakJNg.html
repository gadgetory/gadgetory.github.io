calm and this is the iPhone 5 from the
drop chest I did against the galaxy s3
hit 1 and I wasn't done with it I did a
drop test with a hammer I did a scratch
test the knife in my keys and the screen
is still working so my goal is to figure
out how much punish make it take before
the screen actually stops working so I'm
gonna take it to the next level I'm
gonna run this thing over with my car
high so I'm gonna put the iPhone 5 face
down in front of my car tire I don't
know put a face low because I don't want
glass my entire bus go ahead and see how
it fares
all right see how this thing did
well here are the tire marks that you
guys can see and let's go ahead and see
the screen is working and it's still
working okay so let's go ahead and go to
another test so the iPhone is still
working the screen is working our goal
is to make the screen stop working so my
next test is say you on the phone while
you're driving shouldn't be you know on
the phone you have Bluetooth let's say
you are for some reason and you're
driving along and whoever you're on the
phone with you know kind of makes you
mad you throw your phone out the window
you know in a split second out of anger
and you regret it let's see if your
iPhone will survive I saw go ahead and
jump in the car and I might throw this
thing out the window
I like Android more
let's see how it's fair I see it's
definitely way more scratched up on the
display but let's see if it works and it
does so let's take it to the next level
all right so like I said I'm gonna take
it to the next level this time I'm gonna
chug this thing up in the air and see
how it fares so step back
and there you go we have finally broken
the iPhone and as you can see display is
completely gone
it's not working and it's actually
opened up so that's pretty bad don't try
that at home anyway thank you for
