phonebook calm and today I will be
showing you how to pair your Bluetooth
to your Android device so in this case
I'm wearing my Plantronics headset to my
phone and go ahead and show you how to
do it so you're going to press menu to
begin with and hop into settings and
from settings you can go to wireless and
network i'll bluetooth of course is a
wireless control so we can go to
bluetooth settings and then we're going
to hit this little checkbox and turn our
Bluetooth on so the phone will
automatically start scanning for devices
you can see this is where you need to
get your headset so I'll show you what
I'm doing I got my headset right here
most of the time you're going to press
and hold the power button until a little
light search flashing on and off like
usually red and blue sometimes it just
moves sometimes it's a combination of
the two it just really depends on your
headset but I'll go ahead and show you
how to do it so I'm press and hold this
guy so I'm turned it on but I'm still
holding the button until I see it start
flashing now let go and let's see what
the phone is doing so I might search for
devices because once it doesn't find any
it stops looking so I hit search for
devices your phone might say scan for
devices pretty much the same thing I
already found it I'm just going to tap
on this guy and you see it says pairing
and are you going to give it a second
keep an eye on what your headset is
doing so it's still flashing at the
moment stop flashing and the phone says
it's connected and that's pretty much it
same steps go into whatever Bluetooth
you're hooking up so whether it's a
headset or a keyboard or whatever you're
trying to hook up pretty much that's
what you do this day from phone with
comm thanks for watching the video and
don't forget to visit fumble comm for
more cellphone news reviews and how to's
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
