calm and in this video I'm doing a
review on the t-mobile HTC One S right
here so before we get into the review
and talking about what I like and
dislike I'm gonna do a quick hardware
tour so on the front of device you have
your 4.3 inch Super AMOLED qHD display
that's 960 by 540 resolution you have
your home multitask and back buttons
here at the bottom which is pretty much
standard for Ice Cream Sandwich at the
top of the device you have your
front-facing VGA camera right here your
earpiece regular sensors and of course
your t-mobile logo on the back of the
device you have your 8 megapixel camera
capable of 1080p video capture your LED
flash little HTC logo right here Beats
Audio logo at the bottom you have your
speaker grille on the left side of the
device you have nothing but the microUSB
charging port on the right side you have
nothing but your volume rocker volume up
and down at the top you have your 3.5
milimeter headset jack your power key
right here core secondary mic right here
at the bottom you have nothing but your
microphone and if you wanted to put your
SIM card in you could prop this guy out
right here by pulling it like that you
see I have a spot from my micro or my
Micro SIM but there is no external SD
and of course the battery you can't pull
out so it's an internal battery and
that's what really what makes the phone
thinner than what it could be or what it
would have been if it was external
anyways with that hardware tour I'll go
ahead and get into what I like and
dislike about the phone starting with
what I dislike so that way I can end it
on a positive note and I'll just go
ahead and start with what I dislike also
one of the first things that I dislike
about the HTC One S on t-mobile is the
screen and I say that you know mainly
because it is t-mobile's flagship phone
it's the best one that they have on
their lineup right now and because of
that you know I just really expected an
HD screen I mean Timo was really the
only carrier in the u.s. that doesn't
have an HD device I mean Sprint Verizon
HD all do so that's definitely something
that I'm not too happy with it is a
Super AMOLED screen it is q HD so it is
a little bit higher resolution than
that's seen on the t-mobile Galaxy s2
but again it's not Super AMOLED plus so
you know that's a knock on it and also I
mean with a pentile display you just
really want to see an HD screen or
higher resolution to kind of hide the
sub pixel layout but you know what that
said it's not that big of an issue the
screen like I said it is pretty good I
mean I'm not too mad about it you know I
do enjoy it it's just really I just
expected something better but that's the
first thing that just like the second
thing that just like about the HTC One S
is the fact that it only has 16
gigabytes of internal storage so as you
can see you know when I pull this guy
out or the top off there's no slot for
an SD card so you're pretty much stuck
with what you got and there is services
like Dropbox which HTC has a partnership
with Google Drive you wanted to store
your files on Google servers but you
know is this a shame to see that you
know there wasn't an external sd card
and also you know only 16 gigabytes and
you know considering the fact that it is
t-mobile's flagship phone I just
expected more but that's all I'm gonna
say about that and the last thing that
really you know is surprising is the
Beats Audio logo over here I don't know
if you guys can see it but it's kind of
fading already I mean I've only had the
phone for a couple of weeks now and
that's probably mainly due to my case
which I took off for this review but
it's kind of chipping right here it's
kind of like painted on while the screen
are I mean the hardware itself you know
you can scratch and you don't see
anything on the actual body of the phone
that Beats Audio logo seems to be fading
a little bit and also the other thing
that you know I'm not too happy about
and you know really wish that
manufactures will stop doing is putting
the power key here at the top because
when you're using the phone you're
typically using like this you know
scrolling about and when you want to
turn off the screen or turn on you would
reach right here but this is where the
volume key is now to actually power the
screen off I have to either move my
thumb up all the way over here or after
you know move my index finger like this
to turn turn it off and turn it back on
so it's kind of a hassle I don't know
why agencies tend to stick with that
design Samsung seems to be pretty much
set on putting on the right side maybe
they're just doing it to differentiate
themselves but that's
I definitely would rather see on the
side of the device then on the top but
that's pretty much it when it comes to
the things that dislike because there's
definitely more like about the foam then
there is this like and I'll go ahead and
start talking about some of the things I
like starting with the design of the HTC
One S when I first got this phone and
you know till this day I still believe
that the HTC One S is the best designed
cell phone or smartphone I've ever used
and probably the best out there I mean
it says super thin only eight
millimeters are less than eight
millimeters thin it's I believe 7.5 the
phone is super light less than 120 grams
and the screen size seems to be just
about perfect I mean it's not small by
any means like the iPhone I'd say it's a
little bit of a small screen where this
guy it gives you the best of both worlds
it's bigger but it's not too big where
you have trouble reaching a corner of
the screens for example I can reach the
bottom left bottom right top right and
top left without having to move the
phone around so without having to
maneuver or you know tilt my hands or in
any way so definitely like the size
definitely love the design I mean not
just the size of it but the actual you
know way the device looks you have the
gradient gray the materials that age to
use the unibody aluminum design makes it
really tough I mean you can scratch the
phone all you want and nothing really
happens on here I mean there's no
scratches at all and you know I really
appreciate that it's about time phone
manufacturers start doing that if you
drop the phone you don't have to worry
about a big old scratch I mean I'm not
gonna test that theory but I you know
take HTC's word as far as it being
scratch resistant but that's pretty much
all I want to say about the design I
mean saying that it's the best design
phone or the best feeling phone or best
looking foam that I've ever had or ever
seen I think says a lot about it but
what that said I want to go over the
next thing which I love about the phone
name that's the processor I mean that's
the main thing that you know wanted me
to get this phone and that was the
Snapdragon s4 I saw the benchmarks
online and wanted to see how I performed
in real life and it pretty much performs
how I expected it to being just a
dual-core it's really fast everything
this flies in the West I don't see any
lagging whatsoever
everything a click or a tap on is pretty
much instant which is you know what
everybody wants on their phone I'm going
to run a quadrant benchmark standard
test so that way you guys could get a
better idea as far as the performance
goes so let's go ahead and pause the
video and let you guys see the results
as soon as this is done
