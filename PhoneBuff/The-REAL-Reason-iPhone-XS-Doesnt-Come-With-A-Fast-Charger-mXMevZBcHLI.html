supporting fast charging on all their
new iPhones finally given their
customers the ability to quickly charge
their batteries up to 50% in as little
as 30 minutes not only is this a really
convenient feature to have when you're
running low on battery in the middle of
the day but by finally supporting it
Apple has helped the iPhone kind of
catch up to its Android competitors who
have been offering the feature for years
but here's the thing unlike Samsung
unlike LG or Google or Huawei or
Motorola Apple's decided to think
different and not include a fast charger
in the box and instead they sell the
cable and adapter you need separately
for $70 which you know when you've just
spent a thousand dollars on a new iPhone
10s or even $1,100 on the 10s max you
kind of expect Apple to throw you a bone
right like every other manufacturer
includes a fast charger in the box so
why does an Apple well in today's video
we're gonna try to answer that question
looking at three potential reasons why
Apple may have decided not to include a
fast charger in the box and to start
things off we have to go over the first
reason that comes to mind the most
obvious reason to anybody who isn't a
complete Apple sheep and that's that
Apple just sees an opportunity to make
more money by not including a fast
charger in the box not only this Apple
increase the profit margin on every
single iPhone sold with a cheaper
charger but they also get to increase
the revenue from their accessories
business from anybody who wants fast
charging so from a business perspective
as long as people don't stop buying
iPhones because they're not including
fast chargers there's really no reason
for Apple to do so and the reality is
most people aren't going to avoid buying
an iPhone just because it doesn't
include a fast charger in fact I'd go as
far as saying that most iPhone users
outside of the tech community don't even
know what fast charging is so again why
would Apple just give it to them for
free giving away stuff for free isn't
exactly how Apple became a trillion
dollar company but who knows right like
maybe the extra profit isn't the real
reason maybe the real reason is actually
the opposite and that Apple is trying to
save you money by having the iPhone last
you longer
now I know that sounds crazy and it
probably is considering it's against
their main revenue model but hear me out
for a second
so because fast charging effectively
pushes more energy into the battery in a
shorter amount of time
it generates more heat than conventional
charging does and as both Apple and
Samsung will tell you on their websites
excess heat is generally bad news for
battery capacity in fact Apple goes as
far as recommending that you remove
certain cases from your iPhone while
you're charging it in order to help cool
things down so by not equipping each and
every new iPhone user out there with a
fast charger who most likely will only
charge their phone overnight anyways
we're fast charging doesn't really
matter Apple may be saving millions of
iPhones from excess heats which in
theory could help those iPhones last
longer sure it may not make a difference
in the first year or the second year
maybe not even in the third but
considering that Apple is now supporting
iPhones for longer than ever with the
five year old iPhone 5s still updated to
iOS 12 it could have a real effect so is
this the real reason you know while it
is interesting to consider I don't think
so at the end of the day if Apple really
only cared about battery preservation
they could always ship the iPhone with
fast chargers and just build in a
software feature in iOS 12 that defaults
the iPhone to slow charging Samsung has
a future just like this where you can
toggle fast charging on and off so
clearly Apple can do it as well but they
don't so while extending the life of the
iPhones battery may or may not be a
supporting reason for Apple it's
definitely not the real reason why
they're not including a fast charger but
let's shift gears now and move on to the
third reason why Apple may have decided
not to include a fast charger and maybe
more importantly why they may not ever
include a fast charger in an iPhone box
and that reason is Apple believes
Wireless is the future it's the reason
why they say they got rid of the
headphone jack and it's the vision that
will inevitably lead them to getting rid
of the charging port and getting rid of
that charging port would be a lot harder
of a transition if your customer base
was already used to fast charging
because as of right now wireless
charging is 2 times slower than fast
charging via a cable and given all the
troubles that Apple has had with air
power I don't know if it's guaranteed
that by the time the Apple does remove
the charging ports that wireless
charging will be equal to what you can
get with fast charging so there's a good
chance the Apple may be holding off on
making fast charging standard on the
iPhone because they plan on getting rid
of wired charging altogether by not
including a fast charger in the box and
by putting a pretty high price on fast
charging they ultimately reduce the
total amount of people who become
accustomed to it and therefore they
reduce the total amount of backlash that
they'll get when they remove the
charging port so which one is it what's
the real reason why annoyingly Apple
isn't including a fast charger in the
box is Apple just being greedy or are
they trying to extend your battery life
or are they setting themselves up for a
successful transition into a wireless
future personally I think it's more
about the money in the short term and
about the transition to becoming fully
wireless in the long term but what do
you guys think let me know down below in
the comments anyways that is it for me
in this video thank you guys for
watching and as always I'll see you in
the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
