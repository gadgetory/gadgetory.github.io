and this one i'm doing a speed
comparison test between the Samsung
Galaxy s3 here on the left against the
Nokia Lumia 900 on the right basically
both these guys are you know arguably
the best phone on their respective
platform I'll go ahead and start the
first speed test which is the Budapest
these guys at the same time and let go
when they vibrate alright so see which
bone actually turns on first they're
both wearing the same Wi-Fi network I
cleared up the browsing history on both
so when I do the browser test will be
nice and even I'm gonna be doing
application speed test obviously they're
running different OSS so the apps will
be written differently but they're from
the same developer so hopefully we get a
good idea as far as the experience at
least we'll get let's see which one
loads up first there's no sim card here
so I'll get a SIM card error but pretty
much as soon as I get that error it's
done so you can see pretty much at I I
mean as soon as I hit close and it shows
the Start screen this guy showed the
lockscreen so really really close been
pretty consistent to you I mean I've
done a whole bunch of tests and pretty
much they load up at the same time every
single time I'll go ahead and unlock
this guy and let's go right into our
application speed test so we'll do ESPN
first right here so 1 2 3 and there you
go you can see the ESPN app loaded up
first on the Lumia 900 so we'll go ahead
and back out of here and close this guy
out and let's it remove all which close
it out there we'll load up the next step
which is Flixter so on this one you want
to pay attention to the right edge of
the screen actually have to scroll over
because the first screen on this one
just shows the text where the Android
version shows all the pictures so I
really want to see which one loads up
all the pictures first
so I'll just swipe over so tap them the
same time and I'll try to swipe over and
you can see it took a little bit longer
for it to load up on the Lumia 900 so I
give the win to the galaxy s3 in this
test but really really close on both
I'll go ahead and close out the app
right there alright go to the next test
which is the dictionary.com test so or
app so we'll go ahead and load this guy
up 1 2 3
right there again the Galaxy s3 is the
winner so we'll go ahead and back out of
here and again I mean pretty much every
single test I've done here is you know
the difference is basically a few
milliseconds if any if that so press and
hold here remove all and just let you
guys know this is closing out the ABS as
you see and my task manager there's no
active app application so don't worry
about that the next test
I'll run is a little bit of Skype so one
two three
let's see which one logs in first I
heard the noise first one in gloomy 900
now on the galaxy s3 so the wind goes
over to the Lumia 900 and you know a
Skype being owned by Microsoft I kind of
expected that you see it's still logged
in here I'm gonna actually log out so
log out yes alright make sure it's
closed this time there you go and let's
go ahead and do a camera load up speed
so see which one camera actually
launches first so I'll type tap the
camera icon at the same time so one two
three you can see the viewfinder is
already loaded on here and now it's
loaded up on here so obviously the win
goes to the galaxy s3 and let's go ahead
and do the browser test so we can finish
this guy up so the internet is full run
here just regular old internet on the
galaxy s3 like I said I cleared out the
history so I'll go ahead and type in
phone buff and now we'll go ahead and
load those guys up at the same time
all right so I went ahead and typed it
in on both phones and I'll hit go at the
same time so one two three and you can
see on the Illumina herd the constants
actually showing first put the load bar
down here about sixty percent this guy's
in 80 but it's done now and we're still
loading up some content here as you can
see and it's not loading up the app ads
or anything on the illuminator which it
doesn't on Windows Phone it loaded up
everything on the galaxy s3 just like
you see on a computer there you go now
it's done so that's that I'll go ahead
and go to the next test which will load
up let's do yoga comm so I'll type in
Yahoo all right so I'll go ahead and hit
go at the same time one two three all
right it's done on the galaxy s3 and now
it's done on the lumia 900 obviously the
wind goes to the galaxy s3 and let's tap
desktop one two three
obviously we expect the galaxy s3 the
windows department because browsing
really you know depends upon processing
power as you can see it's done already
Lumina turns about 60 percent this guy
has a dual-core 1.5 gb processor what
versus a single-core 1.4 year processor
so I mean those are our results pretty
much overall I have to say obviously the
galaxy s3 is faster but Windows Phones
does a really really nice job as far as
making the OS very efficient because a
1.4 gear is pretty much competing with
this dual-core over here on the left
with 2 gigs around with vs. only 512 so
both ones will give you a great
experience but if you're looking for
faster browsing you're definitely get
that on the galaxy history over all the
apps you know while they're a little bit
more efficient on the Nokia Lumia 900
the shared processing power makes up for
that on the galaxy s3 and a lot of the
apps for opening up faster on this guy
put up tests as well even so overall the
winner is the galaxy s3 and that's
pretty much different in this video if
