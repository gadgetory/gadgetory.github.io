instead of doing a video sample on the
samsung galaxy note 10.1 so far from the
looks of it it looks pretty good this
actually the front facer so shooting in
720p off that 1.9 megapixel camera right
now i'm inside my car obviously so i
want to give you guys idea as far as the
sound quality and obviously the video
quality imma this guy around and
we'll go ahead and take a look at the
rear camera see you know what the
difference is obviously five medical
camera but that guy only shoots in 720p
as well so i'm not sure if it's gonna
make all that much of a difference so
anyway it's go ahead and turn scout
around alright so this is the rear
camera shooting from that five mix of
camera on the back of the galaxy note
10.1 and like i said earlier it's 92 in
1080p it's in 720p so kind of
unfortunate that samsung didn't you know
give 1080p on this 5 mix it like it is
on the Galaxy Nexus at least but anyway
you guys could be the judge of the
quality will go ahead and upload this to
youtube but as soon as i'm done and let
me know what you guys think if you like
the video thumbs up and subscribe to
channel thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
