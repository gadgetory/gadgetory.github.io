6s plus and the Galaxy Note 5 are
arguably - the best smartphones out on
the market right now so in this two-part
video series we're gonna be comparing
them
Bombo style where we're gonna be looking
at a bunch of reasons why each
smartphone can be considered better than
the other but before we get into it I
want to give a quick shout out to
Harry's for making this video possible
who actually have a special deal for you
phone box that I'll let you know about
in a little bit so stay tuned for that
but with that said let's go ahead and
get right into it
reason number one while both phones have
fingerprint scanners the one on the
iPhone 6s plus is more accurate works
faster and is better supported by
third-party apps to the Lightning port
on the 6s plus allows you to plug in
your charger in either direction making
it especially easy to plug in when the
lights are off at night 3 the iPhone has
a physical vibrate switch which not only
allows you to put the phone on vibrate
without having to turn the screen on but
it also acts as a visual indicator
allowing you to know whether or not your
phone was on vibrate with a quick glance
for the iPhone 6s plus has an aluminum
back instead of a glass back like on the
note 5 which makes it much less
susceptible to damage when being dropped
and also isn't anywhere near as much of
a fingerprint magnet reason number five
with 3d touch you have a whole new way
of interacting with the iPhone giving
you the option to do things like
previewing pop easily select text and
jump straight into shortcuts all by
applying a little more force to the
pressure-sensitive screen 6 while the
app store in the Play Store offer mostly
the same things the app store on the
iPhone still has the advantage of
typically getting new apps and their
respective app updates well before their
Android counterparts 7 speaking of apps
on the note 5 you obviously can't
download apps like Siri iMessage and
Safari yet on the iPhone not only do you
get all of Apple's apps you also get
Google's like Google now hangouts and
Chrome giving you the best of both
worlds eight as we found in our film of
style speed test the iPhone 6s plus
opens apps faster and keeps apps ready
to go in the background longer than the
note 5 giving you better overall
performance 9 the iPhone 6s plus has
more LTE bands in the note 5 making it a
better option for those who travel
internationally reason number ten if you
use up a lot of storage on your phone
the iPhone 6s plus might be your best
bet as Apple offers a 128 gigabyte model
of the 6s plus whereas the note 5 tops
out at just 64 gigabytes 11 if you plan
on getting one of these phones for your
kid the iPhone offers you more parental
controls with restrictions which allow
you to block content and actions through
a password-protected setting 12 with
family sharing on the iPhone you can
share your purchases from iTunes iBooks
in the App Store with up to 6 people and
your family without having to use the
same accounts or passwords offering a
significant savings advantage that just
isn't available on the note 513 unlike
on the note 5 the iPhone 6s plus gives
you an option to undo and redo tags
simply by shaking the phone which could
be a pretty big time saver 14 the iPhone
6s plus comes free of any unwanted
carrier apps and carrier logos which is
not something you could say about at
least some versions of the galaxy note 5
reason number 15 the fact of the matter
is people are taking more selfies and
with the iPhone 6s plus you can make
sure they look great even in low-light
conditions thanks to the front-facing
flash feature which works surprisingly
well thanks to the big and bright
display 16 because the iPhone gets us
updates directly from Apple you'll be
updated to the latest version of iOS
pretty much just after Apple releases it
we're on the galaxy note 5 it can be
months before you get an update after
it's been released
17 on the iPhone 6s plus you can tap the
notification bar while in any app to
automatically scroll all the way to the
top which can be useful from the list
get really long 18 historically speaking
iPhones have had better resale values
than galaxies so in a year or two
there's a good chance that you'll get
more money back for the iPhone 6s plus
than you would for the note 519 with
continuity you can move seamlessly
between your Apple devices doing things
from opening the notes you were taking
on your Mac on your iPhone to answering
a call from your iPhone on your iPad
reason number 20 not only does the 6s
plus this speaker produce richer and
fuller sound than the note 5s the iPhone
also has a more powerful headphone jack
making for a better overall audio
experience 21 from pretty much anywhere
you can copy and paste on the 6s plus
you have the option to have selected
text
back to you out loud which is ideal for
when you're reading a really long
article or when you can't keep your eyes
off from what you're currently doing 22
the iPhone 6s plus allows you to capture
true 240 FPS slow-motion video in 720p
which gives you better and smoother
slow-motion video footage 23 the iPhone
6s plus offers better landscape support
than the note 5 where the larger screen
is taken advantage of in apps like
settings the browser and even on the
home screen making the phone feel more
like a little tablet 24 unlike on the
note 5 when you connect a Bluetooth
accessory with the iPhone 6s plus you
get an icon in the notification bar
indicating the battery level of the
connected accessory and finally reason
number 25 not only does the iPhone 6s
plus offer a longer BER shot but it also
has live photos which make your photos
come to life with short three-second
clips to make reliving those moments
that much better
alright so before I get out of here I
want to talk about shaving and more
specifically the process of buying the
razors to shave which consists of going
out to the store waiting in line and
then overpaying for a pack of four
blades because really the only other
option is to get the cheap disposable
blades that end up cutting your face
which is obviously something you don't
want and that's really where Harry's
comes in offering you high-quality
German engineered razors at a fraction
of the price delivered straight to your
door and with free shipping so I've
personally been using their Truman set
that costs just 15 bucks and it comes
with a premium feeling handle three
super high-quality blade cartridges and
your choice of either shaving cream or
foaming shave gel and as a special deal
for your phone buffs Harry's is hooking
it up with $5 off when you use promo
code foam buff at checkout that's a
month's worth of Shaving for just 10
bucks so make sure you click on that
first thing down below in the
description and don't forget to use
promo code foam buff at checkout for $5
off alright guys that is pretty much it
for me in this video the Galaxy Note 5s
version will be annotated somewhere here
on the screen and will also be linked
for you down below in the description so
make sure you check it out if you
haven't already but anyways thank you
guys for watching it I'll see you in the
very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
