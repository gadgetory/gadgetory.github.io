this video I'm gonna show you how to
make folders on your iOS device whether
it's an iPhone or an iPad so the way you
do it is you find the apps that you want
to make a folder out of so in this case
I'm gonna do iTunes Flixter and Shazam
so I'll go ahead and make a folder by
pressing and holding on one of the apps
so in this case I'll press and hold
shows am tell you it starts wiggling you
see the little X's and I'm gonna place
it over top of iTunes so I place it over
top you get this little menu right here
I think is drop it right here or drop it
in the little icon hit the HOME key to
finalize my changes and you can see the
iPhone names the folder music by
intelligently being able to determine
that these two apps have to do with
music so that's great and all now let's
say I wanted to add a third app like I
said Flixster so put it in here and put
it in the folder again hit home to
finalize my changes and there you go now
I have three apps my folder but of
course music doesn't have to do anything
with Flixter so I want to rename this
folder to may be entertainment so the
way I do that is just press and hold on
any app within the folder you get into
editing mode hit this little X type in
entertainment so entertainment hits
space done hit the HOME key again to
finalize your changes and that's it so
now on your iphones home screen you have
the entertainment folder now let's say
later on change my mind I don't want
this folder anymore the way you delete a
folder is just take the apps out of the
folder one by one and the folder will
automatically delete and there you go
alright that's it for me in this video
this is Dave from formal comm thank you
