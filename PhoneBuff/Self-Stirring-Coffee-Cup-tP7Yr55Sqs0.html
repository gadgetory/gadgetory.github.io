second what do you know I mean caffeine
we're not sponsored just he just likes
Red Bull I wish we were sponsored what's
up guys david and jay here and today
we're gonna be checking out something
that we don't normally cover here on the
channel and that is a coffee mug now
this thing isn't just your ordinary
coffee mug it's a coffee mug that looks
like a camera lens and and it's self
stirring go ahead on box this thing
alright and uh if you guys take a look
at it you'll see it looks like your
ordinary lens and the package with a
nice with very luxurious expensive
packaging now one thing i want to point
out about the packaging is a distraction
guarantee so despite the packaging let's
you said well this this is this is
pretty good like i mean it has all the
focal length it has a focus ring the
zoom has auto focus manual focus and
there's also the stabilizer here which i
don't think it does stabilize now our
souls in the box earlier says yeah
that's a little switch that's concerning
to me with self stirring alright let's
see here and if you notice if you notice
ah penny can't can you
no it's can i am can i an i am like
will.i.am imagine like any other service
it opens up like so families so it's
like so i go i go talk about this i'm
little alright so you can see inside of
the thing that's the little steering
mechanism it doesn't look the sharpest
or the cleanest but is it just plastic
yeah it's a little plastic stirrer
now when i'm thinking you put batteries
in soap
like shoot Ripper days come our gun
trusty TV remote we go but hey but it's
freaking louder dude that's what it
looks like supposed to make a look at
that I want to see this here alright
guys so we filled it up with coffee and
milk the moment of truth is coming
whether or not this will make the work
will it actually stir the coffee for us
you want when you too long ago me turn
on the the stabilizer button yeah you
could do the honors by the way the paint
is coming off on this thing already
alright here we go and three two
it's it's work it's not doing oh okay
it's doing the whirlpool now it's oh
 struggling a little bit your chaser
is copying for your red coal does it
taste good
at least mmm how can you tell you're
drunk try it it's actually freakin good
tastes like tastes like mixed I mean
then again most of the credit goes to
the copy machine okay here we go so blip
that in the air right it looks
awesome okay here we go and he's gonna
over the best oh wow instance the
basically this thing that saves you from
using a spoon this another way
technology is making us lazier that's
really strong put a lot more Super than
I should have but it does work it does
work it does work it does worry Freeman
works bucks to put that let's put the
lid on all right so uh I guess that's it
I mean there's not much more we can say
about a coffee mug that looks like a
lens that stirs itself pretty much
everything that was needed to be said
about it was said in that sentence
anyways that is it for us in this video
if you guys liked it make sure to hit
that thumbs up button and uh as always
we'll see you in the very next episode
