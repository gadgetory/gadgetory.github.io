ball calm and in this video we're doing
a comparison between the Exynos 4 quad
on the samsung galaxy note 2 over here
and the Snapdragon s4 pro on the Nexus 4
to see which processor is faster between
the two now both are actually very
similar in the respect that they're both
quad cores and they have similar clock
speeds the X and O's world quad is
clocked at 1.6 gigahertz while the s4
pro is clocked at 1.5 meters so really
close both devices have to us ramps it's
gonna be as nice and even as we can get
it obviously the Nexus 4 is running on
Android 4.2 jelly bean stock while the
Galaxy Note 2 is running on 4.1 with
Samsung's TouchWiz UI so a little bit
different in that respect but the test
that imma be doing isn't really gonna
reflect that because it's not a
traditional speed test where I open up
apps or the browser I'm gonna actually
be encoding some video so basically I
loaded the same video from my computer
onto the devices and what I'm gonna do
is encode them at the same time and
basically we'll see which one actually
finishes processing the first and we'll
kind of get our answer as far as which
one processes a little bit faster so
well try to tap them at the same time
we'll turn the quality way up to 720p
and we'll make the video quality high of
course so we'll go to high and that will
just tap on the button at the top right
at the same time so one two three
both are transcoding now and I will go
ahead and see which one finishes first
the video is one minute and it was shot
in 1080p but it's basically compressing
it to 720p because really this is app
called video trim which is meant to make
your videos smaller so I'll go ahead and
skip to the results so we could actually
see you know which one finishes first
you
all right so it's done on the Nexus for
the Galaxy Note 2 is at 87% when this
one actually finished so basically you
know from this test you could conclude
that you know this is about maybe about
13% faster I was watching the speeds are
the rendering for the most part and this
one is about at most was about 15%
faster than it was on the Galaxy Note 2
now I know the benchmarks online
indicated that the s4 pro was gonna be
faster but this is more of a real-world
test I mean this is something that I
actually do quite often as far as
compressing my video so I gotta email
them and by the way the app is called
bit trim Pro I definitely recommend
checking it out because I love it but
anyway that's pretty much it for me in
this video I just wanted to give you
guys a better idea as far as you know
which processor is faster clearly we got
the answer here this Snapdragon s4 pro
is faster when it comes to processing
speed or processing a video now I can't
say if it's better when it comes to
gaming and graphics performance with the
Adreno 320 GPU but my you know hunch is
pretty much that it probably is and the
benchmark seemed to indicate that as
well so that is pretty much it for me in
this video you guys found it helpful
