bumble calm and in this will be doing a
comparison between the Tegra 3 processor
and the echinus four quad processor but
specifically looking at the GPS on these
guys so the twelve core GPU here the
omalley of four 100 GPU overclocked from
the version that we saw on the galaxy s2
and basically we're gonna see we know
which one actually performs better in
the real world we've seen benchmarks and
from the benchmarks that I've seen
online
it looks like the EGNOS world quad with
Mally 400 GPU out edges the Tegra 3
processor but I want to see how it looks
from your life but before we do that I'm
gonna run a quick benchmark just so you
guys could see I'll do quadrant and
since I'm not looking for the CPU speed
or memory speed I'm gonna go ahead and
uncheck the other options here in this
test I'm will be looking at the 2d in 3d
graphics I'll hit start really quick and
I'll just kind of skip through this oh
yes K this gives straight to the results
okay so the benchmark is done obviously
both of these vices are kinda show up at
the top because we only ran the graphics
portion of the test
so the Nexus 7 with its Tegra 3
processor scored a 1356 it looks like
356 but there's a 1 there it's not
showing up with 13563 oh I'll show it
13:56 as you guys could see and I will
go ahead and look at the economics for
quad and it scored a 17 22 so 17 22 so
like I said earlier the benchmark does
seem to favor the economic for of quad
we'll go ahead and hit home on these
guys and we'll go ahead and run Google
Earth to actually test the real-world
experience that you'll get with each of
these devices so I'm gonna run Google
Earth I'm gonna go to Las Vegas if you
guys are familiar with my GPU tests that
I've done in the past I'm gonna go to
Las Vegas let both devices load up the
terrain basically all the 3d buildings
that are in Vegas and after you know a
minute or so of letting each load up
I'll go ahead and do a pinch in pinch
out and just kind of pan around test
kind of see you know which one actually
performs more smoothly and honestly I
mean I could have ran games on here
obviously there's a Tegra enhanced games
on these type of three and you don't
have the uh neck unit for quad but like
you guys are seen on the channel you
guys could actually do a hack that you
know makes the non Tegra processors have
that same optimization so comparing
games isn't necessarily thing that you
know I want to do for the actual test
Google Earth really helps with that
because it really does put a lot of
pressure or strain on the processors
more so than any other game I've seen so
with that said I'm gonna go ahead and
zoom in and I'll let these guys load up
for a minute and I'll skip to the actual
test all right so I let both devices
load up for like a minute or two
hopefully they're both done I'll go
ahead and start the test on the Exynos 4
quad because I did load that one up a
little bit faster or a little bit before
I did it on the table 3 so anyway we'll
go ahead and pinch in and out so we're
looking at a 3d building this building
right here is the Venetian
now you guys could actually see it's a
Venetian right here so it's gonna zoom
in and out
and just kind of pay attention to how
smooth and or choppy the whole
experience is so I'll zoom in on it a
little bit more we'll do a 3d kind of
landscape and we'll move from side to
side look at some of the other buildings
all right and I will go ahead and look
at the Wynn building now and I will do
the same exact thing on the Asus Nexus 7
to test that technically processor and
the good thing about testing these two
tablets is that they're both running the
same resolution at 1280 by 800 so the
resolution you know won't play a factor
as far as you know one having the edge
over the other and of course both
devices are on the same Wi-Fi network
and now you can see pretty smooth I mean
for the most part everything seems like
it isn't you know lagging or anything
compare this to some of the other
devices I've done I mean much much
smoother compared to the dual cores you
know the Snapdragon s4 and you know
other processors like the OMAP 4460 this
quad core processor definitely can
handle it a lot better and I will just
kind of look at this last building
really quick we'll do a 3d view all
right so hopefully that gives you an
idea as far as the performance you could
expect out of that guy and we'll go
ahead and push this off and that now
let's look at the Nexus 7 with the Tegra
3 so all right well again do the pinch
in and pinch out and now we'll do a
little 360 view
and then we'll kind of pan around so let
me go back in front of it like it didn't
lust test it's a little pan and pretty
much it looks like I'm eating just about
the same kind of performance not really
you know something that I could say
easily one is better than the other
maybe you got a little bit choppy right
here with the tag of three but there's
you know the moments where the Eknath
for quad had you know it's choppiness so
really hard to tell i mean usually I'm
able to get a much better indicator as
far as you know one outperforming the
other when it comes to this it doesn't
seem like it's making that big of a
difference let's go ahead and look at
the win now of course you know this is
my opinion if you guys you know or
watching the video and kind of kid
rewind and fast-forward and look at the
direct comparisons you'll get a better
idea as far as you know one performing
better than the other but right now it
kind of actually feels like they're
pretty much the same I mean I don't know
it looks pretty good to me so let's go
to that last building that I looked at
right over here and we'll do the 360
view of it and I mean really really
smooth performance on the secretary so I
really can't say you know which one
performs better just from this
comparison you know you go off the
benchmark and you say you know the a key
notes for quad seemed like it did
perform better you know we'll take one
last look at it side by side so I'll do
a 360 view and you can see I mean it's
really really smooth I'll try to spin
faster actually see if that will give us
an idea so I'm spinning pretty fast and
it's handling it pretty well so we'll do
the same thing here we'll zoom in on the
same building and we'll try to spin it
fast
and again it seems to be handling it
pretty well as well and now you get a
remember I mean right now there's a lot
of 3d content being loaded on it doesn't
look like much maybe but if you feel
these two tablets I can feel them
getting hot through the screen you know
if I turn them around and thought the
battery those things are burning up
right now but again it looks really
smooth so anyway this wanted to do this
comparison video you know unfortunately
we didn't get a clear winner you know
you kind of have to go off maybe the
benchmark and assume that maybe idea
it's are the akeno's four quads better
but at the same time you know benchmarks
aren't a reflection on real-world
experience you know when it comes to
real-world experience it seems the same
and also the Tegra 3 processor has its
advantages because when it comes to
actually taking advantage of the great
you know graphics capabilities tank of
three actually does that more so than
the echinus because there's techni three
optimized games there isn't akeno's for
quad you know optimized games out on the
Play Store so you know you give the edge
for the benchmarks here you give the
edge for the better games and optimized
games here and from the real-world
performance they seem just about the
same to me and that pretty much you
gotta pick your poison but anyway that's
it for me in this video if you found it
