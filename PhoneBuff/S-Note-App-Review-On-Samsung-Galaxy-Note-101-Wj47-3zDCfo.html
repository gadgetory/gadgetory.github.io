in this video I'm doing a review on the
S note application available on the
samsung galaxy note 10.1 which I have
over here and also some of the other
galaxy note devices out there on the
market now when you first open up the
application you're taken to this screen
now because I do have it in landscape
mode we're gonna get a tool bar over
here on the left side that shows us all
the folders that we have within the app
and on the right side it's the contents
of the folder that's currently selected
so for example if I were to switch over
to a different folder you're gonna see
different content within it now these
are just pre-installed ones that Samsung
put on pretty much just to give you an
idea as far as you know what you could
do with this note application so for
example under the business folder I
could tap on something like financial
information and it would just give me a
quick example of you know what I could
do with this application you know giving
you this kind of ideas as far as how you
could use this application to your
advantage
something that is useful though is that
these two little notes right over here
which is productivity tool tips which
basically shows you how to use this
application to your advantage so it's a
quick you know guide as far as you know
what you do of course I will be doing
that in this video as well so you will
necessarily need that some s note tips
and tricks basically just to give you a
better idea as far as if you forget on
how to use something so anyway let's go
ahead and go right into it first thing
you need to do to open up a new note of
course its press this plus icon here at
the top you're just gonna tap on this
guy and you have to select between these
templates over here you can do a regular
note an idea note meeting note magazine
etc for the purpose of this video I'm
just gonna be going over the notes and
idea notes because the other ones are
kind of similar and you know pretty much
you get the point with the first two so
I'm just gonna tap one note and you can
see I'm taking to the screen which
basically I have a blank notepad now if
I wanted to scroll up and down all I
have to do is tap on the top left over
here which takes me out of edit mode to
view move view mode so I could view my
notepad if I want to bring that toolbar
back up I tap this arrow I'm gonna hit
edit mode again I get my toolbar and
from a to Worr I have different options
for example right now one the
handwriting
I could write whatever I want if I tap
on this guy I'm gonna get a whole bunch
of options to change the thickness of my
stroke with my pen I could change what
kind of you know penny would be for
example I can go from a pen to a paint
brush to I don't even know what that is
a pencil anyway you guys get the idea
can change the colors to whatever color
I want and of course like I said I can
make a thicker or thinner and you know
say I wanted that hit X and there you go
so that's that you have an undo and
forward button so I'm just gonna go
ahead and undo those two little strokes
that I did now what's really cool is you
also have this little formula bar or
formula toolbar option so you see the
little graph over here you can't really
do anything with it yet if you tap it
again you have an option you can do
formula match you can do shape match and
you can do handwriting to text now I'm
gonna do formula match first because it
does show up first so I'm gonna go ahead
and select that so you see over here I
have just a little chart now what's cool
with there's a say for example you want
to do an algebra problem or if you need
help with your homework or whatever
you're using it for which I had this you
know when I was in school for example if
I did you know hope might not work with
this think stroke let's go ahead and try
to make this a little thinner and it's
go black and we use a pencil alright
let's go right back to it so say for
example I had a homework problem
it was x squared + 25 X minus 43 equals
I don't know say 21 you would you know
have to solve that and obviously if
you're doing for homework you want to do
yourself but what's cool is you can use
the search button and it'll actually go
into dual window mode which is something
that you know it's on the Galaxy Note
10.1 which basically allows you to use
one application left side the screen one
application the right or if you go in
portrait mode it's it's a top and bottom
and obviously it's because this device
so powerful with this akeno's processor
and whatnot it's able to do it so anyway
we actually get the answer so this is
the input right that's what I put in and
then you actually get the graph you get
the alternate forms of writing it and
you get the solutions for X honestly
really also I like I said I really wish
I had this I'm definitely a great tool
here you know
if you're in school whether in high
school college and you want help I want
to be able to do your work on a tablet I
mean nothing's really gonna be that so
if you want to get out of dual window
mode you're just gonna tap this X now
first example let's say I wanted this
not because I'm right-handed I want this
on the right side and this on the left
side I could actually tap this button
right over here and hit switch windows
so if flip-flops them puts the work on
the left and I could continue doing my
work here on the right so that's it
gives you a quick idea as far as how
that works and go ahead and X out of
that and we'll go and show you the next
one which is shape match so let's do a
shape for example so let's say I wanted
to draw a triangle that's a pretty bad
triangle but you can see it kind of
fixes it up for me now if I wanted to
make you know a better one
I could probably like that let's say I
made a circle and you know if all this
kind of makes your shapes a little bit
you know better looking I'm gonna try to
change my pencil settings here I'm gonna
go to the pen because it seems a little
bit better now there's a erase function
right over here I'm gonna go ahead and
erase out of here and one more time I'll
demonstrate a square because I'm
horrible at drawing squares but
thankfully for this app it's whoops I
have to go into shape mode all right
right again let's do a square and you
can see it makes it perfect oh that's a
rectangle but you guys get the idea to
do a circle it's gonna make a perfect
circle for me no matter how big or how
small I want to make it so really cool a
bunch of shapes work you know I could do
a star and this is gonna make the edges
you know pointing straight lines flow
for example if I draw a line like this
are actually let's do a straight line
you can see it makes it perfectly
straight so I could literally draw a
rectangle one by one like that and it's
gonna look perfect last thing is
handwriting's text pretty simple to say
I write you know my name so it's right
David I don't know if it's gonna get
that there you go yeah I did so David
pretty much translates my handwriting to
actual typing which is pretty cool if
you prefer to write instead of type so
go ahead and get out of there when you
tap the text button this is where you
could actually type if you wanted to
type instead of using handwriting and of
course the eraser function I already
showed you you could erase everything on
the right side other than the back and
four buttons do you have an option to
input a some kind of picture for example
you could take a picture of your camera
you can scroll through your own images
in your gallery or a clipboard which is
what you copy and pasted Maps clipart
text box of shape so is this tap on
clipart and see what they have and when
I tap on this guy you can see I have a
whole bunch of little artwork that I
could choose from so I could choose you
know a little camera a little pencil
whatever it is kind of like it is on you
know Microsoft Word so pretty much
that's really what they're aiming to do
I could also record a memo if I wanted
and lastly you put my favorite function
on here especially because it's a big
tablet and if you really want to use you
know the s-pen there's this operator up
here which you can see I had it enabled
by the fact that it was highlighted in
blue what this does is it's basically
stands for s S Pen only so when I it's
on only in the S Pen washer so for
example right now I go like that well
that's kind of works I got out my finger
it works problem is you know something
I'm trying to write something and my
pinkie will start to write you know
because I'm using I place my fist or my
other side of my hand on the screen and
it kind of messes me up and I was
actually having trouble with it before I
even knew this existed then I typed this
guy now I could write all I want with my
finger and it's not gonna do anything so
that way only the S Pen recognizes your
input and you know honestly it works a
lot better just like a paper you know
your hand is gonna write down anything
on a piece of paper this really makes it
feel like you have a piece of paper in
your tablet so definitely really cool
functionality I'm go ahead and close out
of here now and we'll go ahead and take
a look at the other template that I said
I was gonna talk about which is the idea
note now for the most part this is
similar I mean you have the same tools
over here as you did as far as the
toolbar goes but the one major
difference is you actually have an
option to record a sketching so for
example if I tap on this and you can see
now it's flashing it's recording I could
actually write so I'll write you know
phone buff rocks ok so to actually view
the sketch that I just made all I have
to do is hit this play button so you
have to go into View mode like I said so
right now I'm in edit mode I'm gonna be
you know writing whatever I want on the
screen but when I tap on this the input
not gonna work is it's gonna scroll up
and down like I showed you earlier but
on the tool or you see I have an option
to hit play so I'm just gonna hit play
and you can see it pretty much recorded
everything
I was writing so it's a cool way to uh
you know look at you know what your work
and how you did it so I don't know just
a cool little idea that Samsung included
with their software I don't know how
useful it'll be for some people but I
thought it's pretty cool so I'm go ahead
and delete that we'll go ahead and back
out of here and yeah that's pretty much
it on the eslint application I mean so
far you know I've really really enjoyed
it you know I used it on the Galaxy Note
and I don't even know if they call it s
no I think they call it something else
I'm not sure but anyway it's a lot
better now and you know you have a whole
bunch options of course you get import
you know other notes you can share them
you can move them you could go to
settings and adjust some of the things
on here for example if you want s-pen on
audio our Auto video tags you know all
this stuff so anyway I'll go ahead and
back out of here and hopefully this
gives you a better idea as far as you
know what the S note application brings
to the table I'll go ahead and open up a
few of these other templates just to
guys we get a quick look at it
so here's the recipe template and you
can see you can add images of you know a
recipe you want to make so you just got
to tap and hold right over here and then
you would take a picture or go to images
and you know choose a picture that you
want to include in your recipe book for
example so I only have a screenshot now
let's go ahead and enter that as an
example and see how it works and there
you go so it enters in nice neatly into
the template and you know I could go
ahead and start writing my little recipe
and then maybe send it to somebody that
I want to share it with but anyway
that's pretty much it for me in this
video hopefully this gives you a better
day if you guys have any questions on s
note and how it works to sleep uh leave
them in the comments below and I'll try
to get back to them as soon as I can but
other than that that's it for me this
