February 21st Samsung is holding a
special media event for what is likely
going to be the unveiling of the galaxy
s7 and s7 edge while they haven't
released any official info on the phones
just yet there are a bunch of rumors and
leaks online albeit unofficially that
give us a pretty good idea of what to
expect the first thing worth mentioning
is the galaxy s7 is most likely going to
look a lot like the galaxy s6 with
Samsung taking a page out of Apple's
playbook with two-year design cycles the
leaked shows slightly curved edges
around the back of the phones similar to
what we saw Samson do with the note 5
but on the s7 the curved edges will be
going all the way around as far as the
screens though the SN will be roughly
the same size as the s6 with either a
5.1 or a 5.2 inch display with the s7
edge hitting that sweet spot between the
s7 and you know 5 at around 5.5 inches
there's been some mumblings about 4k and
if Samsung does end up going with a 4k
screen it'll likely only be on the s7
edge but my bet is that both phones will
be sticking with a quad HD resolution
and be on an improved version of
Samsung's Super AMOLED display
underneath the hood you'll get either a
Snapdragon 820 or Samsung's own Exynos
chip depending on your countries variant
but both Mary's will be coupled with 4
gigabytes of RAM which should make for
some interesting form of style speed
tests now one word that I'm hoping turns
out to be true is the return of both IP
67 water resistance and an expandable
microSD slot which has been sorely
missed since the galaxy s5 back in 2014
Samsung might finally be done with these
spec Wars downgrading the camera from 16
to 12 megapixels but will make up for it
with what will likely be awesome
low-light capabilities going from an
f-stop of 1.9 down to an unheard-of 1.7
one of the common complaints for the s6
and pretty much any smartphone nowadays
is battery life but Samsung looks to
change that by upping the battery from
26 hundred milliamps up to 3,000
milliamps on the s7 and a whopping 36
hundred milliamps on the s7 edge and
it's reported to be able to stay on for
17 hours of straight video playback on a
single charge so that's premium awesome
Samsung will likely include his own
version of the iPhones 3d touch making
the s7 screen pressure sensitive which
should allow for some quick and easy
shortcuts within touch
last Bonelli's may be the most important
rumor of all is the release date which
is believed to be on March 11th but to
reiterate all these are just rumors and
speculation at this point and we won't
know anything for sure and tell us
Samsung's big event later this month
that is pretty much it for me in this
video there will be a bunch of galaxy s7
coverage coming to their channel shortly
so subscribe if you haven't already give
this video a big thumbs up if you liked
it and as always I'll see you in the
very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
