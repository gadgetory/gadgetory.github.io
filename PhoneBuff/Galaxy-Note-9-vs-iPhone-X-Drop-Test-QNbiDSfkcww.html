very expensive smartphones and while
they're all glass designs do look nice
and enable certain features like
wireless charging it obviously makes
them much more susceptible to completely
shattering in the event of a drop now
both Samsung and Apple have taken some
steps in order to make these all glass
phones a little bit more durable Apple
is using what they claim to be the
strongest glass ever in a smartphone and
Samsung has been using a new stronger
aluminium that supposedly helps reduce
the total amount of shock that's sent to
the glass when it drops so today we're
gonna be testing both of these phones
side by side to see which
thousand-dollar flagship is actually
more durable let's get right into it for
the first time ever build a new website
run on your phone in just minutes with
artificial design intelligence
no robot required big thanks to Wix for
sponsoring this video we're with their
AI building a site on your phone is as
simple as answering a few questions
uploading some photos and picking a
theme that best matches your style or if
you want more fine control you can use
the drag-and-drop editor on your
computer like I did to get everything
looking just the way you want either way

round number one backdrop in three two
one
so after that backdrop the good news is
both phones still remain fully
functional but the bad news at least for
the note 9 is the rear glass is
completely shattered
it looks like the no 9 set the bulk of
the damage at the bottom left corner
with the kind of spider webbing up all
across the back the iPhone 10 on the
other hand did really really well with
its only damage being a tiny crack in
the glass that's kind of hard to see
here on camera and a small scuff mark on
that big ol protruding camera lens that
may have actually helped the iPhone
break its fall by the way it's an easy
one for the iPhone 10 in round number
one round number two corner drop three
two one
neither phone took too much damage from
that corner job
however the no.9 does suffer quite a few
scuff marks on its blue aluminum frame
which you know while not significant
definitely looks worse than the
scratches on the iPhone 10 stainless
steel giving the iPhone the slight edge
here in round number two round number
three base drop in the three to one
after that base drop both bones have
their screens cracked the no.9 suffers
the bulk of its damage at the bottom
rights with some severe spider webbing
up along the right edge while the iPhone
tends damage comes mainly to its top
left corner with the rest of its screen
remaining largely unaffected giving it
the win once again here in round number
three bonus round with both bones still
remaining fully functional after our
10-point inspection we entered the bonus
round where we'll be dropping them up to
ten times from just under five feet to
put the impact and shock resistance of
each phone to the test
last time the iPhone 10 was only able to
survive five drops before its home
gesture completely failed to respond
deeming the phone pretty much unusable
let's see if the Galaxy Note 9 can do
any better
three two one all right drop number two
and three two one
Oh baby I definitely saw some more glass
fly out of there and the bowl is still
working it's just crazy that this phone
still works in three two you know
like I'm so convinced every time I check
it that when I turn this thing around
its not gonna be working but it is three
two one you know what doesn't even sound
the worst of all the drop so I'm pretty
confident this thing's gonna work could
I be wrong Oh
turned it off on accident nope still
works
look at that Wow sue that s kind of
works
that'll be actually an interesting test
okay go home yep as ten still works just
play still fully functional we can make
a call so get up it passes
round number four impressive so after
conducting yet another ten point
inspection testing everything from the
screen and the buttons to the speakers
and sensors everything remains fully
functional even that variable aperture
sure the phone doesn't look pretty at
this point and will most definitely cut
your finger if you attempt to use it but
the fact that Samsung made the note 9 in
this resistant to impact internally is
very impressive
alright so with four rounds in the books
let's take a look at the scorecard in
the first round the iPhone 10 had just
crushed the note 9 coming away almost
unscathed in the second the stainless
steel frame on the iPhone was able to
outshine the no nines aluminum while in
the third both phones cracked but the no
nines damage was worse and finally in
the fourth round the no 9 was able to
turn things around with an impressive
showing of impact and shock resistance
but in the end it was the iPhone I was
able to tally in a higher overall score
making it the winner in this drop test
if you guys want to see how the Galaxy
no 9 in the iPhone 10 rank compared to
the other phones that we've tested check
