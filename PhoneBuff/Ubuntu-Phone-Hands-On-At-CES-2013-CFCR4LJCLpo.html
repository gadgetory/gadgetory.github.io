is fully touch optimized version of the
most popular Linux operating system like
you see it's very clean under the front
we can see any buttons because we don't
need because we use edges for all the
interactions and this one you see when
you turn the phone on first so so it's
locked I can't do anything said I put to
the barrier so I can access all the
functional example if I swipe from the
left I get access to all my favorite
apps it's not limited times you like a
special lock screen application and from
the right I just go back to the previous
case the top ID system I can support
envelopes
so now let's launch an app so this one
of our new apps the gallery is really
clean organic user and there's no part
of everyone and because of scrolling I
want to be my photos everything
disappears it's just
throw those 40
and this is where the reason how this
can be so clean is that we use the
bottom edge to hidin trivia with all the
options so if I want to edit the photo I
pull on this toolbar access these many
years here for example share which is
integrated to me cos so it's just like
one swipe and click the way I can share
any coke
and system like this on the top so so I
can access all the settings behind this
is usually on pounds the top bar icon
stone to anything but yeah I think I can
see it I can use it look I know if I
swipe across it can swipe it down and
treat my networks when I'm done I just
push it the way the same with messages
so this is one place where I see all my
messages and I can also absolute so any
message for if I gave away from the
notification bar that's cool so I don't
have to go to the app to reply to your
message i can see Stu is right here
where an interest jose costa many on my
workflow or whatever stealing the
application of interrupt video so one
lasting multitasking so new apps from
the left
and then how do I get back so that's
what the right bride dress ok so you
swipe over exactly to install a camera
I Sri camera
the both of us
doesn't know how do I get back to the
gallery so it's just why the gallery so
basically it's almost like the fact by
just swiping over to the right move it
right if you go through your active
education so that's why I swipe again
it's like a stack of God okay I got sure
that's a good way to switch between apps
books out yeah but if I want to see like
all my absolutely so I swipe again from
the left but a little bit further
everything I learned my apps page okay
goes to see all my running apps i can
manage them and you can see all the
other apps including the one to the
sofas and we'll have already been
installed yet do you close the apps or
do they like some lettuce self manager
so you will be able to close them so
like okay this will be added later on
yeah so how further notification how
would you get rid of like if you didn't
want to see that attack but one of the
texts you want to get rid of them oh
okay so it's just like so I to swipe it
up here or they say we're all
just as well as the app integration like
how you had that picture would that be
like you know you you'd be able to share
with facebook would you be able to do
with like other half the download on the
phone later on or is it just a certain
set up chalupa social I hope you like
apps content actually capabilities to
the OS okay for the wheel happens on
whether they are whether they are native
apps or web apps so okay so yeah this is
running on the Galaxy Nexus right so
it's going to be like release for a
download to be able to flash on two
bombs later on or zinc it will ya and so
that the community and a curse and
enthusiasts can hit parents out play
with and you guys going to do like bones
later on without with it shipping would
with what I have the core idea at the
CES so to hit like partnerships running
it
many batteries and areas of uses you
know if it's gonna be like a dual boot
of like you to Android and a bunt or is
this one are probably this here we have
replaced Android complete okay so that I
would assume that like it's possible to
hack your way any combination yeah but
God like then it's up to 250 you what
you want to do it was privileged to see
the phone app eyeballs out to make a
call how do you do that its twenty three
apps
oh there's a full full full power nap
and messaging sweet right right
integrated right next to each other
ignites out these contacts and so
basically all your communications were
right there in that one exact same so
here I can make blood flows okay so
basically it's all controlled via
gestures the edges are so absent
anything c'mon tatarskiy accessing your
system settings what are the other than
actually that without the settings look
like like the system settings
so they would probably look more like
gotcha
so and he said how long do you think
it'll take
where do we are gaining claiming the
light this year like what's called
fourth quarter over the next year
depending and it would that be like a
software built like so you people can
flash on their own phones would that be
like actresses so the class remove image
will come earlier so others an image
that you can flash money on the Galaxy
Nexus device okay simula oh yeah
come within okay and like how long have
you been using so this this bill is was
probably a little before Christmas ogre
series well and this shows you your
tweets right now so any luck sure so
this is a personal info graphic on the
welcome to me which grossed over time
based on your ponies
okay so depending on like how could
you've been tweeting your clothes
Brazil's will grow over time and reflect
your it is created by a an artist who
works on data visualization okay

really become come come alive I got
