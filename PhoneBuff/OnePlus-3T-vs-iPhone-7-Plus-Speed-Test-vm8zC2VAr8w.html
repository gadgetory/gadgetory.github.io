plus three is currently the fastest
Android phone we have ever tested here
on the channel but just a few months
after its release oneplus decided to
give it an upgrade to make it even
faster with new Snapdragon 820 one chip
replacing the lower clock Snapdragon 820
and the question on everyone's mind is
was it enough of an upgrade to dethrone
the current form of style speed - champ
in the iPhone 7 plus well that's what
we're new testing here today but before
we get into it I want to give a big
shout out to Braintree payments for
sponsoring today's video so developing
your own mobile app can be complex but
integrating your own payment option no
longer has to be with Braintree your
business can accept nearly every type of
payments from any device with just one
integration everything from pesos to
PayPal to android pay and whatever
payment option comes next
Braintree simple flexible SDKs make your
job and your payments easier learn more
at Braintree famous calm Splash Bamba
all right let's get to the speed test
all right we'll kick things off by
starting the stopwatch is on each phone
and then jump right into the first row
of system apps where the 1 plus 3t like
the 1 plus 3 before it gets the step
over the iPhone 7 plus already 2 apps
into the second row now in the last be
test with the regular one plus 3 it was
this Photoshop mix app where the iPhone
took the lead but this time around the 3
T was actually able to hold on only two
losses lead in lab sit where both phones
will create a time lapse from the same
exact video file so with the iPhone
finishing the time lapse it moves on to
subway surfers as the 1 plus 3t finishes
laps it in pretty good time joining the
iPhone in the gaming row where the
iPhone 7 plus looks to improve on its
lead powering through flip diving and
actually finishing flip diving before
the 3t finishes with subway surfers
putting it a full lap ahead just over
halfway through this first lap now while
they're still technically a hole in the
lap left to go if the 3t is going to
make a comeback it's probably gonna have
to do it soon as the iPhone has proven
that it can keep all the apps ready to
go in the background despite having just
three gigabytes of RAM but unfortunately
for the 1 plus 3t the iPhone is showing
no signs
slowing down at all just blazing through
this first lap finishing up with Netflix
and moving on to loading both the mobile
and the full version of the Amazon
website log in an impressive time of 1
minute and 15 seconds so as the iPhone
starts working on the second lap the 1 +
3 T is on the last leg of the first
finishing up with ESPN and moving on to
Netflix with the iPhone performing just
as you'd expect without having all the
apps so far ready to go in the
background ok so here we go the 1 + 3 t
finishes the first lap 18 seconds later
with the time of 1 minute and 33 seconds
as it looks to make up some ground here
in the second lap with it's quicker
animations showing us that like the
iPhone it can keep all the apps ready to
go in the background but unfortunately
it's too little too late with the iPhone
finishing first with a time of 1 minute
and 47 seconds with the 1 + 3 T and it's
whopping 6 gigabytes Ram finishing
strong just 12 seconds later with a
total time of 1 minute and 59 seconds
making the winner and still fumble style
speed test champ the iPhone 7 + that is
it for me in this video thank you guys
for watching and as always I'll see you
in the very next episode
