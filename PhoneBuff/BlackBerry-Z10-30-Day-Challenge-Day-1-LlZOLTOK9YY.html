buff and in my last video about the
galaxy note 2 and my experiences with it
I told you guys I was going to be
switching to a new phone and as you guys
probably already know now based on the
title in this video I'm going to be
doing a 30 day challenge with the
blackberry z10 now you may be wondering
you know what exactly is a 30 day
challenge well basically it's a period
of 30 days where i'll be using the
blackberry z10 primarily on my main line
so you know i'm not gonna be using any
other phone other than from phone book
purposes so i can really get to know the
phone both inside and out and more
importantly it gives me a really good
opportunity to answer any questions you
guys may have about the z10 both you
know big and small or the blackberry 10
operating system it's running on so
speaking of questions if you guys have
any let me know down in the comments
below or maybe even a better way to
contact me is on twitter at foam buff or
on facebook and i'll be sure to put
those links down in the description box
below but yeah i'm gonna be using the
blackberry z10 as my daily driver for
the next 30 days and I based off how
that goes I will decide whether or not i
keep on using it going forward or maybe
using another device but you know I'll
be trying to make a video every week or
so for the next month about the z10
sharing my experiences in my opinions
and of course answering as many of your
questions as possible now being
primarily in Android user it's going to
be truly a challenge to switch over to
z10 because of all the differences you
know with the operating system and also
the app selection you know on the
blackberry world compared to the google
play store you know even compared to the
iOS App Store which you're not very
familiar with an oxide using iphone a
lot in the past the z10 is gonna be
something new I mean I haven't really
used a blackberry for a couple of years
now and this one is completely different
any of the ones i've used in the past so
it's gonna be interesting but i'm really
excited to do this because i feel like i
knew it was coming into the mobile arena
it's good for us consumers because i
really do believe that competitions for
success and by blackberry coming in and
bringing new features trying to be
innovative it forces the other companies
to do the same which also really
you know gives us the win because we're
gonna have better choices to choose from
but that's not the only reason why I'm
excited about it now the phone itself
actually looks pretty impressive as a
4.2 inch screen that has HD resolution
which gives you a pixel density of 355
so that's going to be nice also has a
dual core Snapdragon s4 processor 2
gigabytes of ram and an 8 megapixel
camera which I'm going to be sure to
test and a couple of videos in the
future but definitely going to be
exciting and like I said I'd be doing a
video every week or so if you guys have
any questions let me know follow me on
Twitter asking the questions there
that's the best way for me to respond to
you quickly because it gives me a pop up
on my phone but yeah that's pretty much
it for me in this video if you guys
liked it please give it a thumbs up and
keep those questions coming alright see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
