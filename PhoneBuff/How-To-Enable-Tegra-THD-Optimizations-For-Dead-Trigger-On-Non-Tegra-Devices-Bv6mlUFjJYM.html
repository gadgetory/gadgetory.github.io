this video will show you how to enable
the Tegra optimizations on a non tech
device like the Samsung Galaxy s3 for
the game dead trigger so I'm going to
open it up before I actually do the hack
so that way you guys can see what the
game looks like without the Tegra
optimizations and obviously I'm a
compare it once we do the hack to see
what the differences are now keep in
mind you do have to have root access in
order to be able to do this so if you
don't have that do that first I'm go
ahead and load up a quick quest hit
accept and I'm just going to do a quick
walk through through the map so you guys
can get a good feel for what it looks
like without the Tegra optimizations
there you go so first thing you'll
notice is I have it on high quality so
keep that in mind if you're some low it
would look different I went to settings
you made it high quality I have smoke
coming out of these little vents and
that vent over here on the floor we
don't see anything but little like doors
of fences here's my first zombie I'll go
ahead and shoot these guys so pay
attention to how they look as they fall
now will you actually do have a water
effect which you know I previously
thought it was a Tegra only optimization
but we have water falling right over
here I could I walk through it and I get
that little water effect so try that
again so you can see it looks like
there's water dripping onto the screen
so pretty cool alright that should be a
good enough little demo of you know what
it looks like without the Tegra
optimization so I'm going to close out
of the application now the first thing
you're going to need to actually do this
hack is a root explorer so I'm using ES
File Explorer right over here because
it's free and it gives me the
permissions or the access that I need so
you're going to hit menu and then go to
settings and basically what you want to
do is make sure the up to root check box
is checked
make sure the root explorer is checked
and also the mount filesystem box is
checked once those three things are
checked you get back out of here and you
can see i'm on my SD card i'm just gonna
hit up and go to the root directory so
when there's a splash and nothing after
it means you're at the root directory
from here you're going to hit the data
folder it's going to look like that data
and then you hit data once again so data
slash data and then we're going to look
for the Matt trigger games folder so our
match finger games folder so I'm just
going to scroll down think I passed it
there you're madfinger games dead
trigger so I'm going to tap on that guy
alright so there's four files that you
can choose from the one we're looking
for is the second one that says combat
finger games got dead trigger dot XML so
I'm going to tap on that guy and open it
it gives me an option to choose what I
want to open it with I'm going to choose
ES note editor because that's the one
that comes with the file manager and
also I know that it works and you're
taken to this screen basically this is
where you're going to be able to edit
the options for the graphics so the
first thing we're going to look for is
unity graphics quality so right here at
the bottom you see it says unity
graphics quality it's going to scroll
that up a little and it says the value
is the one so I'm going to tap on that
and delete the one and replace it with a
two so you can see now the unity
graphics quality the value is set to two
I'm going to tap back to bring my
keyboard now and the next thing we're
going to look for is the graphics option
so I'm going to scroll down and now you
can see my keyboard came up which is
kind of annoying but can't really help
that so here you go says options graphic
detail value is set to two
so this one we just add one again and
we're going to set it to three so I'm
going to leta to put in a three double
check my work to make sure that it looks
just like that within the quotations and
then uh my head back hit menu and then
save so save save successfully I'm a tap
back to go back into here and now what
you're going to want to do is press and
hold on that file that we just edited
scroll down to where it says properties
and then hit the Change button on the
top change and take off all the
checkboxes for right so that way you
know when you open it up it doesn't
rewrite over it and restore the default
settings I'm gonna hit OK and then ok
once again now you see a file has been
added it's called madfinger games that
triggered XML dot bak I'm going to move
this guy out of here because that's
gonna again give me troubles down the
line so I'm just going to move it to my
SD card I'm a hit
okay and you can see it's out of there
now I'm just going to go ahead and exit
out and open up the game so we can see
if it worked and of course I'm gonna do
a walk-through to see the differences
that the tiger optimizations actually
make all right so before I actually go
into the map I'm going to go into the
settings and show you that the graphic
details details are actually now set to
ultra-high before it was only too high
and that's the highest goal either had
low medium or high
now it's ultra high if I press this plus
sign though it'll revert down to low
medium and high and I won't be able to
access ultra high again so make sure you
don't do that it's going to hit X out of
it and we're gonna go into the quest and
actually look at the differences that we
made all right so we have the map loaded
up so you can see a little bit of lag in
the beginning but we have the same smoke
coming out of this little vent but now
we have this water so before remember we
just had a little door fence doors we
still have those but now we have water
we'd actually shoot the water and get
splashes like that and it just looks a
lot better I mean it's a small little
optimization but makes the gaming
experience a little better and you're
going to get more of that ragdoll effect
that they talk about when you are
killing off these zombies of course we
still have that water effect over here
and we had it before so of course we're
still going to have it and I mean it's
pretty much that mean you guys could see
that the graphics are a little bit in
handsome it's not a night and day
difference it's just a few optimizations
that you get with the Tegra processors
usually and now with this hack you get
it you know with just about any phone
that gets supported so anyway that's it
for me in this video if you found it
helpful please hit the like button and
subscribe and if you want to look at the
XDA thread that you know the guy who
actually figured it out I put the link
in the description box so check that out
and big thanks to him all right thank
