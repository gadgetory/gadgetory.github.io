calm and in this video we're doing what
it looks like i'm lee scratching the
iPhone 5 with a knife I'll be dropping a
hammer on it and also be scratching it
with my keys just to see how it fares as
you can see this is the iPhone that I
use for my drop test I'm not going to
destroy a whole nother iPhone the screen
still works of course the back looks
perfectly fine and the edges as well but
we can go ahead and see how the back
fares first and we'll finish off for the
screen and you know see if this thing's
gonna get completely destroyed so first
we'll start with the keys so take one
look at the back really quick
as you guys can see it's pretty much
scratch list so see how well this
anodized material actually fared so
scratching it really hard with my keys
and you can see there's a whole bunch of
markings but they wipe right off so
pretty good I mean it's a really tough
material mean this phone like I said is
from the scratch or the drop test and
the back looks perfectly fine so the
anodized material is definitely holding
up again I'll do it one more time I'll
do circles end up I'm applying a lot of
pressure obviously you see a whole bunch
little circles I made again it's wiping
right off so the back of the iPhone 5
you know the anodized material is real
really strong really really durable
let's go ahead and try with something a
little bit sharper though right let's do
a knife so I'm just gonna tap like that
maybe poke it a few times alright so
there's no way you know that's gonna be
wiped off so you can see the scratches
are there I'm gonna go ahead and try to
see if it comes off and well I mean for
the most part it is coming off so it's
doing really really well in this scratch
as you can see that when I was kind of
stabbing with a knife those little holes
are still there they're not gonna come
off I don't think so
so I mean still pretty good I mean
you're never going to be doing that with
your iPhone obviously this is for the
occasional drop the occasional you know
key scratch so want to show you how this
phone is going to hold up pretty good
the back is pretty good let's go ahead
and
do the front now so let's go ahead and
turn off the display I'll do it on a
part of the screen that isn't actually
you know scratched up so I'll do it on
the bottom left so I'll start the keys
and really scratching it as hard as it
can
you know without it falling out of my
hand all right
you see the residue from all that
scratching go ahead and see if I can
wipe it off and uh looks pretty good I
mean doesn't look bad at all
we'll go ahead and try it with a knife
now so again same area and we'll do a
little bit of stabbing all right looks
like I hit the home button but the
screen itself looks pretty good swipe it
off my shirt really quick all right so
you can see it does look pretty good I
mean I'm not bad I mean there's I'm
looking at you know in person I'm not
sure how well it's coming up on camera
but it is pretty up you know clean so I
mean it doesn't look like it's scratched
up at all let's go ahead and you know
try it one more time with a knife so
again I'm gonna do that same area let's
move this out of the way so what we'll
do is it form the angle ready get the
sharper part I'll peel off the screen to
the side here okay so one thing I
noticed on the side this part right here
does you know easily get scuffed up you
know then every time with the knife ice
you know slash down it did make a little
bit of a little scuff right here you
guys can see all those little bumps
that's pretty much from the knife but
the screen itself really good I mean it
didn't really do anything so that
definitely looks good go ahead and try
to finish this guy off so um before I do
this you know let's look at the screen
still working now I'm gonna get the
hammer where you guys been waiting for
and I'm gonna drop it from right over
here this is about maybe six inches so
I'm just going to completely drop it
and you see you got a little bit more
shattered but screens still working so
let's try it again and again the glass
broke is just a little bit more but hey
it's doing pretty good this part of the
screen isn't scratched or cracked yet
let's see what happens and again and
again and again and I u.s. all I mean I
hit that thing really hard and it's
really good I mean I'm really impressed
by how Apple designs iPhone I mean like
I said the scratch started with the drop
test that I did the other day over here
kind of spread when I did the hammer on
this area obviously it's gonna be easier
to spread so maybe if it's a brand new
iPhone it wouldn't have done you know
this bad right here let's go ahead and
see if I can actually break this thing
all right so I practice a little bit
more but the display is still working
all right you know what I'll just save
that to it for another video I guess
because it doesn't want to crack I mean
the displayed won't stop working so
that's pretty impressive anyway that's
pretty much it for me in this video I
know it's kind of hard to watch guys but
anyway if you found this video helpful
in any way I mean helpful in the sense
that hey the iPhone kid takes some you
know some damage please hit the like
button it helps me out a lot and
