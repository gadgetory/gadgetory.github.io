bumble calm and in this video we're
doing a review on the volume plus app
available from the android market so
this app has several settings that you
kiddo just their speaker settings heads
and settings Bluetooth settings and in
call I'm only gonna go over speaker
because I don't have a headset or
bluetooth connected and in call settings
requires root access
so my speaker settings and honestly this
is the main reason you get this app
anyway to enable audio modifications you
have to hit this little checkbox and
once you do you can set the volume
levels to what you want so stock is at
zero and you can set it you know plus 1
2 plus 10 is what the developer
recommends of course the app goes all
over plus 20 sometimes when you go up
this high either it just doesn't work at
all as far as the sound goes Auto sounds
really distorted from my Galaxy Nexus I
hit it on 10 because seems to be a nice
range and that gives me a really good
sound or sound volume and doesn't sound
distorted so anyway
right now I'm going to disable it and oh
before I go on I want to show you that
you do have to set it up and your
settings as far as your sound settings
and go under music effects to make sure
that volume plus is checked because if
it isn't then the app might not work or
it won't work so we'll go ahead and go
back to the app so volume plus and I
haven't disabled right now so right now
it's not working
I have a song loaded up in the
background and I may hit play to show
you the before and after effects of the
app so hopefully it comes through on
camera and I'll try to be quiet for a
second so I'm going to play and pay
attention to the volume before and then
after I enable it
all right so that's a little sample now
let's turn this guy on the volume is at
ten and I'll hit play and then I'm gonna
halfway through playing I'm gonna
disable it so you guys can see that you
know effect right before and after or
after and then turning it on so so
hopefully that comes through on camera
um because it really is a noticeable
difference and you know without this app
on my Galaxy Nexus I absolutely hated
the speaker on my phone but now I love
it so definitely recommend it I think
it's two dollars available from the
Google Play Store but um that's pretty
much it thank you for watching the video
and don't forget to visit fumble comm
for more cellphone news reviews and how
to's thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
