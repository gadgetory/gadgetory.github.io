and today i'm going to show you how to
add a contact on Windows Phone 7 so the
first thing you're going to want to do
is scroll over to your main application
list and out from here you're going to
find the people app so there it is
people tap on it and you want to be at
the main screen so you don't want to be
looking at your Facebook newsfeed or
your recent contacts because you're not
going to be able to add a content from
there but from this main screen where
you have a list of all your contacts
you're going to want to hit the little
plus sign or plus icon at the very
bottom and you can select whether you
create a new contact or a new group this
case we want to do contact so I'll tap
on contact and from here you could add a
photo by tapping on this guy and we'll
go to your picture gallery and you can
select the picture of the person you're
adding and to add the name just hit a
little plus sign you type in their name
hit the little Save icon right here this
little floppy disc and same thing with
the phone number and you kind of see
just kind of go along as you want if you
want to add another phone number email
etc and once you're done adding this con
or adding all the details for this
contact just hit the little Save icon
again and that's it this person is now
in your contact book that's it for me
this is Dave for calm thank you for
watching the video and don't forget to
visit for more calm for more cellphone
news reviews and how to's thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
