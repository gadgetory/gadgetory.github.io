had the opportunity to get some hands-on
time with the galaxy s6 and s6 edge
before Samsung's official announcement
and since then I've been able to come up
with a list of the top 10 best new
features that make both the Galaxy s6
and s6 edge probably the most exciting
phones from Samsung since the galaxy s3
so we'll go ahead and kick this thing
off with top feature number one in the
premium build quality and design so
instead of going with a boring
evolutionary design update like in years
past
Samsung decided to start from Ground
Zero and build something completely new
dishing the cheaper filling plastic
materials that we've kind of come to
associate with Samsung in favor of much
more premium feeling glass and metal
with jewel tone colors including white
pearl black sapphire and gold platinum
both the front and the non-removable
back of the galaxy s6 are covered with
Gorilla Glass 4 there's a metal band
that wraps all the way around the sides
machine drilled holes for these speakers
go at the bottom along with those
stylish chamfered edges resulting in a
foam that feels very high-end and it's
just downright sexy to display Samsung
finally broke its habit of making the
Galaxy S 2 screen bigger year after year
with the galaxy s6 retaining the same
5.1 inch screen size that we saw in the
s5 because of this Samsung was able to
reduce the overall footprint of the
phone by making the bezels a little bit
thinner which should translate into
easier one-handed use now while the
screen size technically remains the same
the display itself is actually all new
Samsung bumped the resolution of its
Super AMOLED display up to 2560 by 1440
or quad HD giving you a crazy PPI of 576
this is 30% higher than wolves on the s5
and a whopping 76% higher than on the
iPhone 6 on top of that the display is
now over 30% brighter meaning you'll get
better outdoor visibility to go along
with those super sharp and super crisp
visuals that you'll get from the screen
3 performance so Samsung phones with
their heavy TouchWiz u eyes have never
really been known for their performance
but lately Samsung
been doing a better job at toning down
TouchWiz and including beefier specs on
their phones and with the galaxy s6 this
trend continues with the s6 packing
Samsung's own 64-bit octa-core exynos
processor coupled with not two but three
gigabytes of ddr4 ram and a u FS 2.0
storage which is basically a geeky way
of saying that the galaxy s6 will be
fast and will be one hell of a contender
in the phone book style speed test that
we do here on the channel for
fingerprint scanner so you may be
thinking the galaxy s5 already had a
fingerprint scanner why would it be
considered a new feature on the Galaxy
s6 well the s5s fingerprint scanner was
a swipe fee scanner where you'd swipe
your finger across the home button to
unlock your phone and to be perfectly
honest it didn't work very well at least
compared to the one on the iPhone 5s and
iPhone 6 but on the Galaxy s6 Samsung
has upgraded the swipe based scanner to
a touch based sensor like Apple uses
which should translate into a more
convenient and hopefully more accurate
fingerprint scanner top feature number 5
Samsung pay speaking of the fingerprint
scanner the Galaxy s6 will support
Samsung pay which will be rolling out
later this year it'll work similarly to
Apple pay on the iPhone with use of the
fingerprint scanner and unique
transaction tokens to provide more
secure payments but the key difference
and what's actually exciting about it is
it will also support MST or magnetic
secure transmission in addition to NFC
now what the hell is MST basically it's
a technology that makes the phone work
similarly to the magnetic stripe on your
credit card so having this technology
built right into the galaxy s6 means
that you'll be able to pay with your
phone at about 90% of retailers instead
of just these small percentage that
currently support NFC this feature is
huge and could be the beginning of the
end of the physical wallet 6 camera the
main camera on the galaxy s6 has these
same 16 megapixel resolution that we saw
in the s5 but don't let that fool you
into thinking that the quality of the
camera hasn't changed the s6 is
Suren lens has been vastly improved now
being able to capture more light with an
F 1.9 aperture meaning you'll be able to
take better quality photos and videos in
low-light conditions
the Essex s camera also features optical
image stabilization which will help
prevent blurry photos due to shaky hands
ir detected white balance along with an
auto HDR mode that intelligently uses
HDR for you when the situation calls for
it the auto issuer mode will also be
available on the front camera which has
been upgraded to a five megapixel
shooter with the same f 1.9 aperture so
you'll be able to take your selfies in
high resolution even when you're in a
low light situation like when you're at
a restaurant or a bar 7 charging just
like we saw with the note 4 the galaxy
s6 will support super charging allowing
you to charge the phone 1.5 times faster
than the galaxy s5 and get up to 4 hours
of use after just 10 minutes of charged
time on top of that the s5
also supports wireless charging without
the need for any special cases the
technology is built right into the phone
and will support both of the wireless
charging standards so if you see a
charging pad at a coffee shop or at a
bookstore you won't have to worry about
whether or not the phone is compatible
you can just set it down and note that
it'll work pretty awesome stuff 8
speaker to complement the amazing quad
HD display in the galaxy s6 Samsung has
worked to improve the audio experience
by making these single speaker on the s6
50% louder than the one on the s5
samsung also moved the speaker from the
back of the phone to the bottom which
could help prevent it from getting
blocked while lying flat on the surface
9 storage the galaxy s6 this new design
is definitely a plus but it does come
with the cost of having no microSD slot
so in order to help alleviate this
problem samsung upgraded the built-in
storage to 32 gigabytes for the base
model compared to just 16 on the s5 this
should help give most people more than
enough storage without the need for
expansion but if you're somebody who
thinks they'll need more storage Samsung
will be offering other models up to 128
gigabytes of storage top new feature
number 10 software like I mentioned
earlier samsung has been
lining touch was over the years getting
rid of a lot of the gimmicks and useless
features and adding features that
actually make the user experience better
I think the perfect example of this is
what happens when you double press the
home button before double pressing the
home button would launch s-voice not
very useful considering you have Google
now now when you double press the home
button it launches the camera app in
less than a second regardless of what
app you're looking at or even if the
screen is off this is actually useful
since sometimes you need your camera up
and running ASAP to help capture those
Kodak moments so there are a bunch of
other useful new features that Samsung
has added to the s6 that I'll be
covering in future videos so make sure
you subscribe to that also if you guys
are interested in possibly winning a
calcia Stix we have a giveaway going on
right now on phone book deals I'll be
putting the link that you need to enter
down below in the description so if
you're interested check that out but
other than that that is pretty much it
for me in this video if you liked it
give it a big thumbs up to show you love
and as always I'll see you guys in the
very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
