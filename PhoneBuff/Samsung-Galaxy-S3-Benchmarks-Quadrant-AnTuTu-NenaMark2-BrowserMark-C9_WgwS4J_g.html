this video we're doing a full
benchmarking of the Samsung Galaxy s3
this is actually a t-mobile variant just
in case you guys want to know that we'll
go ahead and start the benchmark the
first one I'll do is of course quadrant
I just restarted this phone so it's off
a fresh boot and I'll just go ahead and
start the benchmark again fast-forward
through the process so you guys get
straight to the score
all right so the benchmark is done yes
get our score and as you can see it's
scored a 48 65 so 4865 pretty good score
I get plus or minus 100 you know
depending on when I run this device or
this benchmark I've got you know 4949 50
before but just keep that in mind I'll
go ahead and close this out because we
are doing benchmarks so we'll go to the
next benchmark which is the antutu
benchmark and again I'll do the same
thing where I started fast-forward
through the whole process and let you
guys see the score so I'll just go to
test and start test and I'll fast
forward
you
all right so the test is done and you
can see it scored a 68 47 so again
pretty good score we'll go ahead and go
straight to the next benchmark so I'll
go ahead and close this guy out and
we'll run the Nano mark benchmark alone
and mark 2 and now this is mostly a
graphics test I'll go ahead and put it
in landscape mode and I will just hit
run and again I'll just uh fast-forward
to the results
you
our size you see you got 59.7 frames per
second right there we'll go ahead and
close out of it I'm pretty much this
like vsync could be pretty much locket
at that so I could probably do a lot
better but figured I might as well run
that test anyway and the last test I'll
run is the browser mark test which
pretty much tests the browser and the
browser alone so I've already loaded it
up here we're just gonna hit run
benchmark and again I'll skip to the end
you
also the browser mark benchmark is done
and you can see it scored a one hundred
nine thousand three hundred five so
that's pretty much it for my benchmarks
pretty good all-around just wanted to do
it says for all those guys that are all
you guys don't wanted to see exactly how
the galaxy has to be fared so anyway I
said for me in this video and found it
helpful please hit the like button and
