came as a bit of a disappointment that
the phone wasn't being powered by the
new Snapdragon 835 with LG instead
having to go with the Snapdragon 820 one
however using the older a21 chip doesn't
really seem to faze LG with them saying
that one of the benefits to using the
Snapdragon 820 one is that they've had a
lot of time to optimize for it add to
that that LG has added heat pipes of the
g6 to help it better dissipate heat and
prevent thermal throttling and in theory
the g6 should perform pretty well but -
just in theory right so today we're
going to put the g6 up against the 1
plus 3t which also uses a Snapdragon 820
one and against the current fumble style
speeds s champ in the iPhone 7 plus to
see how LG's latest flash chip stacks up
to the competition all right we'll kick
things off by starting the stopwatches
on all three phones where the 1 plus 3t
gets the step over the other two with
the g6 right there behind it and the
iPhone 7 plus is falling into third
mainly due to its slower animation the
g6 takes the lead loading the Facebook's
faster than the 3t only to lose it a few
seconds later to the iPhone 7 plus in
Photoshop Express as all three phones
are working on lapid the iPhone improved
honestly just glazing through the time
lapse while the g6 looks to maintain its
lead over the 3t finishing the
time-lapse and joining the iPhone in the
gaming row as the g6 and the three T's
start working on subway surfers the
iPhone moves on to flip diving putting
it a full lap ahead of the other two
early on in this speed test so at least
for now it looks like the real battle is
for second place as the g6 is trying to
hold on to its lead over the 3t for a
shot I winning the title of Android
speed test champ however going into flip
driving both phones are neck and neck
with the 3t actually taking the lead and
moving on two-fifths of fact meanwhile
the iPhone 7 plus is just about done
with the gaming row as it heads over to
the last row here in the first lap
powering through Spotify and moving on
to ESPN it looks like the one plus 3t
has improved on its lead over the g6
instead too fast showing us exactly why
it's been the fastest Android phone for
so long now at the 3t finishes smash it
and the gaming row the iPhone finishes
the first laps clocking in a time of 1
minute and 17 seconds now historically
the iPhone 7 plus has had no issues
keeping all the apps ready to go in the
background
despite having just three gigabytes of
RAM and that certainly looks to be the
case here on the Android side of things
only the one plus 3t which finishes the
first half at the time of 1 minute and
32 seconds has been able to keep all the
apps open thanks to its whopping six
gigabytes of RAM so it'll be interesting
to see how the g6 handles this second
lab as it finishes the first with the
time of 1 minute and 45 seconds
considering the g6 only has 4 gigabytes
RAM so there you go the iPhone finishes
the test with the total time of 1 minute
and 50 seconds with the 3t racing to the
finish line just eight seconds later
with the time of one minute and 58
seconds so moment of truth for the g6 it
does have the first game in subway
surfers open as it does flip diving and
fits fast as well as smash it so we did
have to reload Spotify but it did manage
to keep all the other apps open so
impressive results in the second lap
with the g6 within finishing with a
total time of 2 minutes and 19 seconds
making the winner and still fumble style
speed test champ the iPhone 7 plus now
we're going to take a look at the
individual app little times in a second
but before we do I want to give a big
shout-out to audible for sponsoring
