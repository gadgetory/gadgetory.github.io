from fawn Bluff comm and today I'm going
to show you how to turn off the
vibration on your android smartphone so
the first area where people complain
about vibration it's a lover a hater
type of thing but some people don't like
it so for example right now when I'm
hitting a key every time I hit a key the
phone is vibrating so to turn it off
you're going to go to your home screen
go to menu and then go to settings and
from settings you can look for something
along the lines of language and keyboard
or something similar so depending on
your phone it might be a little bit
different this case is language and
keyboard you're going to click on the
keyboard using out the only one I have
is touch input so I'm gonna tap that guy
and you can see I don't have any options
here your phone might look a little bit
different but what you're really looking
for in this case is under a text input
but what you're really looking for is
right here vibrate when typing so you
can see it's checked I'm just going to
uncheck that guy
you could also uncheck sound feedback if
you want I was going on check that as
well and I'll back out of it and when I
go to my keyboard now it's no longer
vibrating so that's how you turn off the
vibration on your keyboard if you want
to turn off the vibration on the button
presses itself for example every time I
tap something like fire tap menu the
phone vibrates type typing settings the
phone vibrates so to turn that off the
haptic feedback you're going to go to
sound you wouldn't really expect to be
understanding but that's where it is
you're going to scroll down and you can
see right here just vibrate feedback so
it's checked I can uncheck this guy so
now when I'm hitting any button it's not
vibrating at all so that's how you do it
and of course if you want to turn it on
you do the same thing but make sure
those bonds are checked this is David
