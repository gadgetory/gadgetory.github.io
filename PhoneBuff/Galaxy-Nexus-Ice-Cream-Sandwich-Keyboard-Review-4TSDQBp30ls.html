and today we'll be doing a quick review
on the keyboard on the Galaxy Nexus and
therefore ice cream sandwich so I'll go
ahead and type in a couple of sentence
on this guy just to show you how
accurate it is so the quick brown fox
jumped over the lazy dog so you can see
what i was typing for real wasn't
accurate at all but the autocorrect was
smart enough to get it right i'll go
ahead and type another sentence so right
now you are watching this video and now
you can see again it got it mostly right
this case instead of right now it's
happened right bow mainly because nmb
are right next to each other and how
anacrea i'm typing autocorrect didn't
know what i meant to say so i could
actually press and hold on it now though
and you can see it says replace so when
i hit replace it gives me a list of
suggestions and now he is one of them so
it's actually really good the accuracy
is really really good on this keyboard
and i don't really find myself having to
edit the text a lot but having that
option is really nice as well and i'll
also show you the inline spell checker
so i'll go ahead and type something
incorrectly so it's space and you see it
will underline it in red when you tap on
it it automatically will give you a list
of suggestions this case i guess system
would probably the closely into what i
typed and that's how the inline spell
checker works so it's nice additions
that they've added to this keyboard it's
a lot more accurate than it was on
gingerbread and honestly i've really
enjoyed it I feel like it's one of the
best keywords I've ever used on the
smartphone and that's comparing it to
phones like the iphone 4s and also of
course windows phone alright that's it
for me this is dave from mobile com
thank you for watching the video and
don't forget to visit bumblefuck home

to's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
