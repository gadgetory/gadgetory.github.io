calm in this video we'll show you how to
download an app or purchase an app that
the market or Google play's is already
telling you you purchased so I've loaded
up an account on here in which I haven't
purchased the setcpu app but I had an
apk on there the app already installed
on the phone and Google has registered
it as being purchased so when I try to
go into here and hit install and accept
and download you can see I get this
error saying it cannot be downloaded due
to an error
4:03 so let's say you actually want to
go ahead and buy the app again or for
the first time if on your account
there's no way to get past this on the
phone itself but you can't do it on the
computer and I'll show you how I thought
it completed go ahead and open up your
web browser I'm using Google Chrome for
this login to Google Play so go to play
Google com log in to your gmail account
and then on the search bar type in the
app that you're trying to download and
buy so mine is setcpu I went ahead and
opened up the page and what I'm going to
do is right click on installed and hit
inspect element so i right-clicked
got this little popup menu hit inspect
element and what you're looking here for
is above the line that's highlighted
there's a code right here that says data
is purchased and it's set to true what
you want to do is double click on here
double left click on true and type in
false hit enter and then go ahead and
hit X hit installed choose in the device
that you want to go on a continue and
now you have the option to actually buy
it so I could complete my purchase and
there you go now I've bought it and I'll
be able to download it on my phone and
I'm going to show you that I could in
just a second I saw back on my phone and
I'm gonna go ahead and go to the Google
Play Store I'm going to type in setcpu
and again it says purchased but this
time when I go to hit install and hit
accept and download it'll actually work
and that's pretty much it this day from
formal calm thank you for watching the
video and don't forget to visit
