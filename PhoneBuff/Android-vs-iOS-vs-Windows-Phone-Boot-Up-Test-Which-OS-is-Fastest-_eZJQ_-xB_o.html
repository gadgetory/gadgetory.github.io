bumble calm and in this video I'm be
comparing the boot up times between the
three most popular phones are three most
popular os's out there so first
obviously the luck you have Android in
the middle you have iOS on the iPhone
and then you have Windows Phone on the
HTC hd7 so before I do the test I wanna
let you guys know as far as the specs go
as far as processor speed and RAM the
Galaxy Nexus should technically win at
1.2 gigahertz dual-core with 1 gig of
ram the iPhone should come in second
with a 800 megahertz dual-core with 512
megabytes of RAM and then they should
come in third at 1 gigahertz single core
at 512 megabytes of RAM so I'm go ahead
and turn on these two at the same time
and this one right after because I only
have two hands and I will go ahead and
see which one loads of the fastest and
what the you know how close they are to
one another so one two three alright so
if you guys both on quickly go over to
the Windows Phone and got that guy on so
it got at about three seconds or cut
three seconds of slack for the Windows
Phone considering that I did it last so
we'll go ahead and see which one those
of the fastest alright so you can see
the Windows Phones is going through
these little animations and it's done so
when the phone loads of the fastest the
iPhone in this case loaded up the second
fastest and the Galaxy Nexus is still
going so go ahead and unlock these guys
just to show that you know they're fully
loaded and ready to go and the Galaxy
Nexus is still going and it's done so uh
it actually went backwards base off
specs you know this one was the fastest
second fastest and the you know slowest
or third path depending I want to look
at it um you know it's just bit of speed
not really that big of a deal
but just something to you know take a
look at and consider alright that's it
for me in this video the stable comm
thank you for watching it and don't
forget to visit for more
