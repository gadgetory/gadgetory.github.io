calm and in this video i'm giving you a
list of my top 10 reasons why you want
to root your android phone but before i
go into the list i quickly want to go
over what rooting are with what root
actually means basically the word root
comes from the lennox terminology which
refers to a user's access or permissions
to be able to you know access or modify
any file on the system so that has you a
little bit more confusing you were
before
just think of a Windows computer you
have your normal account your guest
account and your administrator account
root access or root permissions
basically is like that administrator
account letting you modify edit delete
otherwise change any file on your
Android phone so with that said let's go
right into the top 10 list of reasons
why you'd want to root your Android
phone in the first place reason number 1
is Wi-Fi tethering or USB tethering
basically the ability to share your
phone's internet or data plan now I know
Android 2.3 above has this ability built
in but the carrier is disable it until
you actually pay them a monthly fee when
you root your phone you bypass that
being able to share your internet access
with other devices without having to pay
you know other than your normal data
plan so definitely an awesome feature my
second reason to rooting your phone is
the ability to overclock its processor a
lot of times phone manufacturers will
leave some performance on the table when
they ship out the phones whether they
under clock the phone's processor or
just didn't push it to its full limits
basically overclocking it you know from
one gears to 1.2 1.3 gigahertz lets you
really take advantage of the phone's
full potential obviously you might give
them some battery life doing this but
there's no better way to get you know
better performance out of your phone
than to overclock the processor itself
but overclocking your phone requires you
to have a custom kernel flashed on your
phone so my third reason to root your
phone is the ability to flash custom
kernels and also custom roms basically a
custom kernel does what I just said it
lets you overclock your phone's
processor and if it doesn't let you
overclock it a lot of times will just
make the code a lot more efficient
letting you run a lot quicker with the
same frequency or may even save you some
battery life a custom ROM you know can
do just about anything I mean it will
give you new features and maybe even
change the way your whole OS looks
I mean if you don't like the way your
phone look when a ship you could
completely change the UI completely
change you know the features with the
custom OS as long as it's compatible
with your phone so I talked about custom
kernels custom roms so you know my
fourth point is the ability to customize
your phone in the first place now I know
Android is one of the most customizable
voices out there you know compared to
iOS and Windows Phone but you know when
you root your phone
it really takes that customization
ability to the next level you know
giving you options to change your
shutdown and mission change your boot up
animation you know change things like
the way that little icons look up in the
notification bar and much much more
there's apps like metamorph to let you
do things like this and I made a how-to
video on the channel offer not only
metamorph but you know whole bunch of
things i want be talking about in this
video if you guys want to learn more
about it but anyway um you know ruining
your phone just really lets you
customize your phone just the way you
like it
so my fifth reason to root your android
phone is actually the reason why i
actually got into rooting in the first
place and that's the ability to update
the OS earlier than you normally would
um no this happened back with the g1 you
know I had a long I think I was on you
know 1.3 or whatever it was before
cupcake and I really wanted cupcake and
I just couldn't wait for t-mobile and
Google to release it so I routed my
phone and got the leaked version flashed
it on my phone and you know I got 1.5
which you know sounds like forever ago
but anyway the same story applies um you
know I did with my Galaxy S again I was
on 2.1 waiting for 2.2 to come out and
you know what this was taking forever by
time we went through Samsung and Google
and t-mobile and all that stuff so I
just got the elite version flasher on my
phone and had it I think like four or
five months before anybody else did so
definitely a cool thing about rooting
phone is being able to get the latest
version the west similar to the way you
you would get it on a nexus phone
speaking of Nexus phones my sixth reason
why you want to root your Android phone
is the ability to remove bloatware or
preloaded apps to get more of that pure
google experience now whether it's a
carrier branded app or a manufacturer up
you know you just don't want it there's
really no way to get rid of it I know a
nice days you can disable it but it
still doesn't take it off your phone
when you read your phone it actually
lets you take it completely off your
phone
you know removes all traces of it and
you know what else could you ask for as
enter gets
better and better with these new version
one more features are being added to the
US and now one feature which wasn't
previously available which is point
number seven being able to take a
screenshot is now available in ICS and I
know on two point three certain
manufacturer do is let you take
screenshots as well but for most other
phones on two point three and below you
didn't have this ability to take
screenshots and now it's a real shame
but thankfully you root your phone you
could take a screenshot so if you're
stuck on 2.3 or 2.2 or whatever it is
root your phone and you'll have this
ability now just ruining your phone
alone isn't going to give you the
ability to actually take screenshots you
actually have to download an app that
lets you do that but those apps require
root access and speaking of that pulling
number eight will forget my fingers
right point number eight is a root only
apps that are available on Google Play
now the screenshot app is just one
example but there's a whole bunch more
there's some that lets you wipe out all
the cash on all your apps with one click
instead of having to go through each
application separately to clear the data
which is a great way to save a whole
bunch of internal storage and there's a
whole bunch more of more examples out
there I mean I can name them
there's over a hundred you know apps out
there that really take advantage of that
root access to give you abilities that
you would have normally not had and
that's really what makes rooting really
fun so definitely check it out once you
root your phone reason number nine for
ruining your Android phone is having
better backup
now I know you know you can backup your
contacts now you can backup your
pictures and things like that your Gmail
accounting you know we log in and stuff
like that but there really isn't you
know a way to fully backup your Android
phone other than if you root your phone
download an app like titanium backup
which not only backs up all that
information that I said before but it
also backs up your application data so
not only do get your ass but like say
for example you have a game with a high
score you probably don't want to lose
that you know probably work hard on that
if you back it up with root it actually
restores all that data so you actually
keep those high scores whenever you uh
flash your phone to a new version or
whatever it is you don't have to worry
about losing all that information so
definitely a better way to backup your
phone is with root access reason number
ten is because you
and I mean why not take advantage of all
those things that are listed before now
obviously there are some drawbacks to
ringing your phone it does void your
manufacturer warranty and that's a big
issue for a lot of people I know that
you know personally before if you
flashback to the stock room which you
have the ability to later most sometimes
manufactures don't have an issue with
that it's just if you try to submit a
rooted phone with a custom ROM on there
they're not going to help you because
they really can't because more than
likely the problem you're having is due
to the custom ROM or the fact that you
are tempered or tampered with the
software but anyway that's my list of
why you want to route your Android phone
hopefully it gives you a better idea as
far as if you want to do it or if you
don't want to do it but either way if
