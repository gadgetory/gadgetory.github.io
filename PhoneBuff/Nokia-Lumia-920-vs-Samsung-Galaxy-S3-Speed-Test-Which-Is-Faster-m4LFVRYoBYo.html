phonebook calm and in this video we'll
be doing a speed comparison test between
the Samsung Galaxy s3 and the Nokia
Lumia 920 to see which phone is faster
between the two now both phones are
packing some impressive hardware the
Lumia 920 has a 1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon
s4 dual-core processor with 1 gigabyte
of RAM and it runs on the Windows Phone
8 OS the galaxy s3 on the other hand has
the same Snapdragon s4 processor in the
US version but it has doubled the RAM at
2 gigabytes and runs on of course
Android 4.1 jelly bean ok so let's get
right into it the first test is the boot
up test so go ahead and power on both
devices at the same time and while these
guys are loading up I'll let you guys
know that bull phones are connected to
the same Wi-Fi network and they both had
their browsing history and cache cleared
out so it's going to be as fair as a
test as possible
so go ahead and wait to see which phone
loads up its respective OS first right
now we're just seeing each manufacturers
logo a boot up animation on the galaxy
s3 now and the galaxy s3 is done loading
we'll go ahead and unlock it and see how
long it takes to connect to the network
actually looks like it's connected now
and the Lumia 920 is now finished so the
win here does go to the galaxy s3 let's
go ahead and go on to the next test so
the next test we're doing is the
application speed test where we see
which phone runs the same app from the
same developer faster so the first step
that will load up is gonna be the Amazon
mobile app so we'll find it on the Lumia
920 and tap them at the same time it
loaded up faster on the galaxy s3 here
so we'll go ahead and back out and go to
the next step which is gonna be the
dictionary.com app tap those at the same
time and this time we loaded faster on
the Lumia 920 let's go ahead and go to
the next step which is going to be the
scores and rap and once again faster on
the Lumia 920 well back out of here and
go to Flixter and it was faster than
Lumia 920 here but it loaded up
differently so we'll go ahead and go to
the theaters tab to see which one loads
up the content first so this time the
content came faster on the galaxy s3 but
what's happened this listing here and it
was faster on the Lumia 920 so 203 times
those faster than the Lumia
so overall the Lumia gets the win for
the flick strap let's go ahead and load
up Twitter so scroll down at the bottom
and tap them at the same time and this
time it loaded it up faster on the
galaxy s3 so go ahead and back out over
here for our final app test we'll go
ahead and load up the camera on both
phones and just a split second faster on
the Lumia 920 here so overall the app
speed test does go to the Lumia 920
let's go ahead and go to the browser
test for the browser test we're gonna be
loading up a couple of websites but
we're not gonna be just looking at the
status bar along we're also going to be
looking at the content to see which
phone actually loads
all the content first so the first set
will load up is gonna be phone buff calm
so we'll go ahead and tap on the links
at the same time and we're seeing much
more content on the Lumia 920 right now
compared to the s3 Lumia 920 actually
looks like it's almost done loading and
the s3 now is showing content Lumia 920
is done and now the s3 is done so the
wind there goes to the 920 we'll go
ahead and tap on this article here and
now we're seeing the content first on
the s3 s3 looks like it's just about
done you pay attention to the YouTube
videos and you can see that the s3
showed it first so when there goes to
the s3 so pretty much for follow up it's
a tie
next I will load up it's gonna be
yahoo.com so we'll go ahead and tap on
links at the same time and seeing
content first on the 9:20 looks like the
9:20 actually finished first let's go
ahead and scroll down and go to the
desktop version so for the mobile
version v9 20 was faster tap on desktop
again seeing content a little faster on
the 9:20 but s3 has caught up and s3
actually finished up first so the win
here goes to the s3 so so far they've
been tied to go to the next test so go
ahead and load up engadget.com
so it's helping the links at the same
time seeing content first on the Lumia
920 satisfy finishes first on the s3 but
content wise the eluvian and 20 gets to
win so let's try to see if we could get
some separation here so we'll tap on
cnn.com on both phones and for the
mobile say it looks like the galaxy s3
finish first we'll go ahead and load up
the desktop site now so I'll scroll down
to the bottom and find that desktop link
so tap on full site at the same time
seeing the content first on the 9:20
they actually looked neck-and-neck right
now and luminous 20 seems to have taken
the lead the Lumia says it's done and
content wise I would agree
so the Lumia gets the win here so
overall it's a tie I mean in one site
the galaxy s3 is faster and another
Antonis faster so browsers seem to be
just about on par with each other
alright so that concludes the speed test
between the Lumia 920 and the Galaxy s3
and the boot up test the galaxy s3 was
faster and the app speed test the
illumina and Tony was faster and in the
browser test they actually ended up
tying so overall the phones are actually
tied in speed honestly if you're gonna
choose one over the other it's got to be
four features because when it comes to
speed these guys are both really really
fast and you can't really go wrong with
either so that's pretty much it for me
