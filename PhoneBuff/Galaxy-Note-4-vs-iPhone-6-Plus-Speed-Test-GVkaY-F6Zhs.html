iPhone 6 and the galaxy s5 not too long
ago but today we're going to be testing
their Big Brother's in the iPhone 6 plus
in the galaxy note 4 which to me is
actually the more interesting matchup
since the note is brand spanking new
just like the iPhone is whereas the
galaxy s5 had been on the market for a
couple of months when I went up against
the iPhone 6 so in this video we'll
really get to see the latest and
greatest both Apple and Samsung go at it
head-to-head any form of style speed
test are you mark get set go alright
as always both phones are coming off
your fresh reboot and are connected to
the same Wi-Fi network we'll begin this
first lap by starting the stopwatch on
each phone and then head into the camera
app where the Galaxy Note 4 has taken an
early lead flying through both the
gallery in Settings app and now working
on loading up ice rage but the iPhone 6
plus isn't letting it slow start hold it
back with both phones being practically
neck-and-neck going into Temple Run 2 as
both phones work on opening the game up
it looks like the iPhone 6 plus actually
loaded it a little bit faster
getting its very first lead so far in
this race but its lead doesn't last for
long as the note board just blows
through smash it and moves on to
Photoshop Touch neither phone was able
to create any kind of separation in the
Photoshop Touch app so with the iPhone 6
plus being just a split second behind
the note 4 this is really anyone's game
and speaking of games both phones are
loading up score mobile right now and
again neither phone was able to create
any kind of separation so maybe we'll
see it here in the Netflix app where the
note 4 finishes first in the iPhone 6
plus struggling a bit so the note 4
increases its lead as it loads up the
full version of the Amazon website with
the iPhone 6 plus just now getting
started with the mobile site alright the
Galaxy Note 4 finishes that first slap
for the time of 1 minute and 7 seconds
which is a relatively healthy 10 seconds
faster than the iPhone 6 plus this time
of 1 minute and 17 seconds but this test
is far from over as the second lap is
testing the multitasking abilities of
each phone getting each app back to the
very last screen that we left it on
during the first
lab and so far the no.4 looks like it's
doing a better job at it with its 3
gigabytes of RAM but it does have to
reload that Photoshop touch-up which
opens a door to a potential comeback for
the iPhone 6 plus which is currently
working on reloading smashing end going
into Photoshop Touch yep it has it ready
to go in the background as it does the
rest of the app so the 6 plus is closing
in but the no 4 finishes just in time at
1 minute and 51 seconds and the iPhone 6
plus finishing just 3 seconds later with
the time of 1 minute and 54 all right so
that was a nail-biter with Ino for
beating the iPhone 6 plus in the first
lap by 10 seconds which gave it enough
of a cushion to hold on to his lead in
the second lap with the iPhone 6 plus
was almost able to make a comeback but
in the end it did come up a little bit
short so the winner for this speed test
is the Galaxy Note 4 if you guys have
any questions about these speed tests or
anything like that drop a comment down
below and for the next hour or so I'll
try to answer as many of your questions
as I possibly can or just hit me up on
twitter at bomba but other than that
that is it for me in this video thank
you for watching it as always I'll see
you guys in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
