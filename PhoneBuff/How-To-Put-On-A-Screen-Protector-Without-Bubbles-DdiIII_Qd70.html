and in this video I will show you how to
put on a screen cover on your phone so
as you can see err you have a screen
cover on my phone and as you can see I
didn't do a good job at it I've got a
whole bunch of bubbles and these guys
aren't coming out I mean I try to get
them out and basically the reason why
they're there is because there's little
pieces of dust stuck underneath the
screen and it's not going to come out
with all the squeegee you know in the
world so anyway I'm gonna apply another
screen cover and this time we do it
right showing you guys what I did wrong
and that way you guys could avoid doing
the same because obviously you don't
wanna be wasting money like I just did
on this guy so anyway first things first
do it in a dust free environment
obviously I try to do that but even
though I did there still does so the
quicker it takes you to actually put the
screen cover on your phone the less
likely there's gonna be dust to go
underneath the screen cover so try to
get it right the first time because the
more you try you know the more likely
they're going to be dust getting stuck
underneath the screen and that those
little air bubbles at least when we
drive me crazy so I can imagine it's
going to have the same would happen to
you anyway uh really try to scrape clean
your screen like perfectly as you can
see there's pretty much nothing on my
screen right now so looks good I could
see little like air or dust particles
flying around with these lights that I
have anyway here's my screen cover and
pull this guy out it's your typical dry
cover it's not the wet apply ones I did
a video on the channel if you guys want
to check out how to do that so basically
it's pretty simple step one is peel this
side off and that this is just a little
plastic covering you put it on the
screen and then peel this other side off
to make it permanent so anyway that is
that I'm going to double check my screen
to make sure it's still super clean and
looks like it is I'm going to set it
down nice and slowly so that way doesn't
like make any dust fly up on top of the
screen
so anyways go ahead and do this so I'm
going to pull off step number one simple
enough and you know most of the screen
covers are the dry ones are like this so
now the mistake I made not only with the
dust thing but I try to put it on from
that bottom up and the reason why you
don't really want
do this is with the new phones
especially with front-facing cameras you
have to make sure the screen cover
aligns with that these little sensors
right here you have to make sure they're
not covered otherwise we're on a phone
call there the screen won't turn off and
your cheek will be dialing buttons and
uh this is notification light doesn't
really matter if that's covered but
anyway I would recommend doing it from
the bottom up so I'm going to put this
guy like this so typically you go the
other way but I think this way is better
so anyway this is the way I'm going to
do it so I'm going to put this guy down
now and I'm going to align it with the
camera if I can and the camera is kind
of covered by a little sticker but I'm
gonna try to do it as well as I can with
the earpiece and then there are little
sensors and the camera and of course I
want it to be straight with the actual
screen itself so that way it's like
going straight down and everything is
perfect so I'm going to align it as best
as I can I think that's pretty good it
looks pretty good from here of course
you can never really tell until you kind
of put it down and looks pretty good so
anyway what you're going to do is work
your way up so I came with a little
squeegee this brand of screen cover that
I got and just kind of squeegee your way
up like this and just work your way up
so anyway I'm working my way up slowly
what not that slow of course like I said
before you want to go kind of quick
because if you don't you risk for every
second you're risking more dust getting
trapped underneath the screen so anyway
I put it on hopefully it looks ok I'm
going to kind of squeegee out these air
bubbles with this uh part on so that way
I don't actually scratch my actual
screen cover because you know who wants
screen cover a brand new one that's
already scratched up so I'm just going
to go ahead and squeegee away for a
little bit all right that's good enough
right now I'm gonna pull off this screen
so you see it's kind of coming off I'm
going to hold this part down and there
you go and put it on you can see this
time it looks a lot better
got a few air bubbles here at the top
I'm just going to kind of squeeze you
away like I said now this screen cover
comes a little like protective layering
so I got that off right there you can
see that had a little
detective layering for the sensors and
that's kind of annoying we've got to try
to get that out it's going to flip it up
a little try to dig those guys out from
underneath the screen cover
there you go and uh looks a lot better I
mean you guys be the judge I mean looks
a lot better than the one I showed you
the beginning of the video and my
screens are now going to be protected
and see how it looks see the screen
cover doesn't even mess with it I got
the ultra clear one so that way it
doesn't you know mess up the screen
clear clarity obviously you're getting a
screen cover because you want to protect
the screen and you know on a Samsung
Galaxy s3 which is the one I'm using
here why wouldn't you want the super
clear move anyway that's it from me in
this video hopefully you know this gives
you a little bit of pointers as to how
to do it um so that way you could avoid
um trust me try to do with this method
because if you tried another method you
might not line up the camera perfectly
and then the front-facing camera would
be covered in this case it's perfectly
revealed same as the sensors and you
want to worry about anything down the
line you want to try to take it off and
put it back on cuz I pretty much
guarantee you as soon as you do that
you're probably going to get dust
underneath the screen but that's it for
