and necessary we're doing a benchmarking
on the HTC One X in this case it's
prints evo 4g LTE variant well go ahead
and start the benchmark and basically
what I'll do is I'll start it and then
I'll just skip to the results so you
guys can see the scores I'm going to be
doing the ante to nano mark quadrant and
limb pack benchmark so let's go ahead
and start with aunt into and I'll let
this guy load up and then I'll just go
ahead and skip to the results so let's
go test and start test
you
alright so the intensive benchmark is
done it scored a 69 88 so moving this up
closer to camera so 69 88 and that those
are the scores for the cpu GPU ram there
you go let's go ahead and run the next
benchmark so i'll go ahead and now
actually close this guy out and just let
you guys know i did do a fresh reboot
before I started this video so
everything's gonna be nice even we'll go
ahead and do quadrant next and I always
run the full benchmark and again skip to
the results
also the quadrant benchmark is done
let's go ahead and hit yes and there you
go we got our results so this time it
scored a 4797 and we'll go ahead and go
on to the next benchmark which is going
to be linpack so let's go ahead and open
up linpack and we'll just run the
multithread five times so we kind of get
an idea as well as far as the average
score so we're going to the first time
so we got 180 for 188 169 176 162 so
basically it's between you know 162 and
189 you know somewhere around 175
probably run average but anyway what's
running one more time 172 so yeah anyway
that's about average go ahead and go to
the next benchmark so let's close this
guy out and then let's run nano mark
this is mostly testing the GPU on the
processor so let's go ahead and hit run
and then again I'll skip to the result
alright so Nana mark benchmark is done
let's go ahead and back we scored a 58.9
as you guys can see right over here and
that's pretty much it for the benchmarks
on this guy I'll go ahead and do a quick
browser benchmark let's do the html5
test all right so you guys can see that
it scored a 270 out of 500 on the html5
test let's go ahead and do the browser
mark benchmark alright so let's go ahead
and run the browser Moroi benchmark
let's hit run and skip right to the
results
alright so the browser benchmark is done
it scored a 100 3109 so as my last
benchmark time running at six benchmarks
hope it gives you a better ideas for is
the performance to expect out of the HTC
One X this case the evo 4G LTE variant
and that's pretty much it for me this
