your Android smartphone or tablet but
for the life of you can't figure out how
to get your device to download and
install it well you've come to the right
place this is dan from Volcom and in
this video I'm gonna show you how to
force an OTA update on your Android
device okay so before I begin I want to
let you guys know that this method will
only work if there's actually an over
there update available for your devices
specific model so the first thing you're
gonna want to do is hop into your
settings and then scroll down to where
it says about phone from here you'll be
able to see which version of Android
you're currently running on and you'll
have an option along the lines of system
updates that allow you to check for a
new update if you're prompted to update
from here then congratulations you're
done but if you're unlucky like I am you
have to force the update by going back
to the settings looking for an option
along the lines of apps or applications
scrolling over to where it says all so
that way you can see all the
applications that are installed on your
phone and look for an app called
Google's services framework once you
find it tap on it and then hit that
clear data button what this does is
actually wipes out all that backend
Google information which includes the
update logs so that way your device will
think that it's never checked for an
update before the next step is to hit
the for stop button so that we actually
close the Google's services framework
app and then go ahead and back out of
there and check for an update like we
did before by going into your settings
scrolling down to where it says about
phone and then going to a system update
so you can see I'm still on 4.2.1 I'm
gonna hit system updates and it gives
you a random date for when you last
check for an update in this case it was
December 31st 1969 so way back when and
all you gotta do is this hit check now
and you can see my phone actually found
the 4.2.2 update on the Google server
and it's automatically downloading and
installing now this doesn't always work
on the first try in fact I had it
cleared the Google services framework
data and recheck for an update five
times before I was able to get it to
work so you might just have to do the
same if you've tried multiple times and
it still doesn't work for you I suggest
waiting a couple of minutes or maybe
even a few hours before making another
attempt and also I'll try restarting
your device to see if that helps but
anyways that's pretty much it for me in
this video if you found it helpful
please give it a thumbs up and be
sure to subscribe to the channel for
