10 and the Galaxy Note AIDS are two the
best smartphones in the world right now
but each of them brings different things
to the table so in this two-part video
series we're gonna be comparing them
Bumble style looking at a bunch of
reasons why the iPhone 10 could be
considered better than the notes in this
video and why the notes can be
considered better in the next video
which I'll be linking for you down below
in the description after watching both
videos we should have vote for which
phone you thought had the stronger
reasons but with that said let's go
ahead and get right into it make your
iPhone 10 modular with the Rhino shield
mod case which can not only protect your
phone from drops of at least 11 feet but
can change and be added onto according
to your needs
learn more at the link below reason
number one dual speakers love it or hate
it that notch at the top of the iPhone
10 does allow for a better audio
experience with a speaker at the top of
the phone and on the bottom of the phone
giving you stereo sound that is not only
significantly louder but it's also
fuller than the single firing speaker on
the note 8 which sounds almost tinny in
comparison to two-tone quad LED flash
the LED light on the back of the iPhone
10 not only supports slow sync flash
where you can light subjects in the
foreground of photos without losing all
the detail in the background but it also
works better as just a regular
flashlight with it being easier to
access from the lockscreen being
brighter than the LED on the note 8 and
with this brightness being user
adjustable 3 taptic engine the vibration
motor on the iPhone 10 offers a wider
range of frequencies than the one on the
note 8 so when you interact with certain
things on the screen the phone responds
in a way that feels a lot more natural
pushing in on an icon feels like a click
instead of a vibrate scrolling through
certain menus feels like spinning a
mechanical wheel and the special haptic
feedback in supported games makes things
just that much more immersive for 3d
touch the entire screen on the iPhone 10
is pressure sensitive which opens the
door for all types of things like
toggling through different app shortcuts
shooting a gun in a game by pushing in
on the screen instead of needing a
separate trigger button and easily
moving the cursor on the keyboard in any
direction reason number 5
so you can go back and forth as to which
phone produces better photos but when it
comes to slow motion video the iPhone 10
is the clear winner with it being
capable of shooting 4k resolution at 60
frames per second and getting 240 frames
per second at 1080p which is double what
you can get on the note eight six
augmented reality the iPhone 10 was
built with augmented reality in mind
with it having not just a dual camera
system on the back but the true depth
camera system on the front meaning not
only can you do things I play AR games
on your coffee table or get dimensions
with virtual measuring tape but you can
also do things with a front camera like
getting a 3d scan of your face to help
you find the perfect pair of glasses
these are just a few examples of what AR
can already do with way more coming in
the future
seven better app experience it's no
secret that app developers prioritized
for iOS which results in not only apps
and app updates coming to iOS first but
apps also seem to generally run better
on the iPhone 8 accessory ecosystem
similar to app developers accessory
manufacturers prioritize for the iPhone
as well since there aren't that many
different iPhone models compared to
Android phones so if you want a suite
docking station or a camera lens case or
other cool accessories you're much more
likely to find one for the iPhone 10
than you are for the Galaxy Note 8 9
Apple stores if you ever run into an
issue with your iPhone 10 like a broken
screen for example you can just walk
into one of the hundreds of Apple stores
around the world and get the issue
resolved usually on the same day reason
number 10 fast OS updates on the iPhone
you get updated to the latest version of
iOS pretty much as soon as Apple
releases it whether it's a major system
upgrade or just a quick little security
fix whereas on the note 8 it usually
takes several months before Samsung is
able to push out an update meaning not
only do you not get to enjoy the latest
and greatest that Android has to offer
on the note AIDS but more importantly it
means that you can be left vulnerable to
security flaws for way longer than you
would be on an iPhone 11 longevity if
you plan on using your phone for longer
than like two years the iPhone is
probably going to be the better bet
since Apple tends to support his phones
for longer
Samson case in point the galaxy s4
released in 2013
stop receiving system updates in 2016
whereas the iPhone 5s which was also
released in 2013 is still running on the
latest version of iOS 11 which by the
way the brand new Note 8 that just came
out like less than four months ago is
already running on an outdated version
of Android think about that 12 resale
value probably related to the fact that
Apple supports their phones for longer
than just a typical upgrade cycle the
iPhone tends to enjoy a higher resale
value than galaxies which means that
you'll get more money back when you
eventually trade it or sell it 13 tap
the top with tap to top you can
automatically scroll to the top of any
screen by tapping on the status bar this
works system-wide in any app and it's
great for when you're really far down an
email thread or a webpage and you want
to get to the top quickly without having
to swipe the screen a bunch of times 14
portrait mode not only the iPhone 10
have Apple's new portrait lighting
effects but because of the new true def
camera system portrait mode works on
both the rear and front cameras compared
to being limited to just the rear
cameras on the note 8 reason number 15
vibrates which the physical vibrate
switch on the iPhone not only makes it
easy to quickly put the phone on silent
whether the screen is on or off but it
also acts as a visual cue so you can
tell if your phone is on vibrate or not
with just a glance 16 easier one-handed
use the notates display is huge and hey
that's an advantage in its own right but
one of the downsides is it's really hard
to use with one hand the top corner of
the note is practically impossible to
reach compared to the iPhones and
depending on how big your hands are the
high placement of the fingerprint
scanner it can be uncomfortable to reach
17 parental controls better parental
controls with restrictions allow you to
block content and actions through a
password-protected setting meaning you
can make sure your kid isn't visiting
any websites that they shouldn't be and
even have the option to prevent them
from clearing the browsing history so
you can monitor their activity sorry
kids 18 iMessage if a lot of your
friends and family members have iPhones
iMessage is going to be an app that you
care about
iMessage not only lets you send messages
with read and received indicators but it
also has things like expressive messages
and emojis that use that new true depth
camera system you can play games right
within a chat window and engine
roll group messaging just seems to be a
lot more consistent nineteen spotlight
search with a simple swipe down from the
home screen you access spotlight search
that lets you search for anything
whether it's an app on your phone an app
on the app store that you want to
download a location in Maps or even
websites matching your search all in one
convenient place reason number twenty
true tone display while the OLED panel
on the iPhone 10 is actually made by
Samsung Apple did add some of its own
technology to it with true tone which
automatically adjust the display
specifically the whites to look the same
regardless of the environment that
you're in
twenty one Wi-Fi password sharing if you
have friends come over to your house and
you both have iPhones you can share your
Wi-Fi password with them automatically
with a single tap by having them trying
to connect you'll get a prompt on your
phone asking you if you want to allow
them to connect and without actually
giving them the password itself they'll
be automatically connected to the
network 22 attention awareness one of
the advantages that Samsung phones have
had over iPhones over the years was
smart stay where the phone would keep
the screen from timing out as long as
you're looking at it well with it's true
depth camera system not only does the
iPhone 10 match this feature but with
face ID it's actually able to add on to
it by keeping your notifications private
on the lockscreen until you look at the
phone and even intelligently lowering
the volume of alerts when it knows
you'll see them anyways 23 complete
phone backup if you get a new iPhone
whether it's a replacement or an upgrade
getting all of your things transferred
over is easy via iCloud or iTunes and
unlike the backup options on the note 8
you get all of your data including
individual app data and login
information whereas on the note aids
you're limited to more of the basics
when it comes to backup and the backup
is nowhere near as consistent 24
continuity if you own a Mac or an iPad
the iPhone has the advantage of allowing
you to move seamlessly between your
devices you could do things like opening
notes from your Mac on your iPhone or
answering a phone call from your iPhone
on your iPad and finally reason number
25 better text input so we already
talked about the ability to get cursor
control with 3d touch but there's
actually more to it so while a half
press on the keyboard gets you cursor
control when you add a little bit more
pressure to the screen you get the
option to highlight words and sentences
which when combined with iOS 11s drag
and drop features on which shake to undo
we do it makes situations where you're
taking notes are writing a long message
a lot easier on the iPhone than it is on
the note eight alright so now that
you've seen why the iPhone 10 could be
considered better than the note 8 click
over here to see why the note 8 could be
considered better than the iPhone 10
don't be closed-minded watch both videos
and again be sure to vote for which
phone you thought have the stronger
reasons but outside of that that is it
for me in this video thank you guys for
watching and as always I'll see you in
the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
