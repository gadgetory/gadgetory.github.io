today i'll be doing a how-to video on
how to delete a stock app for android
you're gonna need two things in order to
be able to do this one is root
permissions on your phone and two is
root explorer and now you can see the
logo for root explorer is right over
here i already have it on my phone you
get downloaded from the android market
and like i said you do need to have root
in order to be able to use root explorer
the app won't be deleting today is gonna
be the web browser the stock samsung web
browser that they load on here let me
see the app it's working you know and i
you could also see that I have the
Dolphin Browser installed that's the one
I actually use I never use this one so
for me there's no point to even have it
so that's why I'm going to delete it and
you could do it any app you want it
could be the browser like I'm doing or
things like contacts or calculator if
you have like aftermarket calculator and
you want to use that as your only one
you don't need the other one you could
just delete the stock one so what that
says it's going to how to do it so
you're gonna open up root explorer and
from roots for you want to make sure you
at the root folder of your phone just
going to look like that top bar just to
slash that means you're at the root
there's just something after it you're
in a folder so you want to back out of
it until you get to the very root and
from here you're gonna go to this system
file and a system file or folder it's
not this one that's sys it's the one
actually full on says system so right
there and from here you're gonna find
the app folder that's where all your
apps are stored so mine is on the very
bottom and you can see all my apks are
right over here the ones that I've
installed from the market are the ones
that came pre-loaded on the phone and
the browsers right here so you long
press on it and you get the pop-up menu
now you could delete it but I don't
recommend deleting it because because if
you delete it and something goes wrong
or later you find out that you
needed it the only way you'll get it
back is doing a hard reset so that's
definitely something you'd want to avoid
so what I recommend doing is actually
hitting move as long as you move the apk
out of the system file out of the system
app folder you'll are it'll go off your
phone so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
move it to my SD card I already made a
folder on my SD card I think I called it
backup apps there you go and now I'm
just gonna paste it right over here so
you see the browser avk has been moved
over here and my hit home going here and
now you can see it's gone it's no longer
an app installed on my phone if I ever
want to replace it I could just do you
know vice versa I could go to my XD card
and paste it right back into the system
at folder but now when I click this guy
it's automatically my default because I
don't have another option but you could
use this process for any app like I said
you can do it for the calculator the
browser the alarm clock doesn't really
matter same the same step-by-step
process will work for you and that's it
for me this is David from foam bluff
