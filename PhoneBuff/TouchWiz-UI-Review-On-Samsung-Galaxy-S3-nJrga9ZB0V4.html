and this will be doing a review of the
new TouchWiz on the Samsung Galaxy s3
I've already done a review on the phone
on the channel if you guys want to check
that out but I didn't really go into
details as far as the new TouchWiz go so
it's gonna be doing here I'm just gonna
be showing you some of the features that
it has so first feature is the lock
screen so roni unlock the phone you'll
notice that you have four little
application shortcuts right here which
you can customize and there's a how-to
on the on the channel as well but I put
my calculator camera and flashlight so
let's go and show you the flashlight so
you just swipe up on it and it goes
straight to the application which is
really nice actually looks something
like a flashlight or camera something
you want to get to quickly but anyway
that's that for the lockscreen also the
lockscreen has this little like
watermark effect so when i unlock the
screen from here you can kind of see
looks like there's a basically Milwaukee
Brewers liquid works with any wallpaper
that you have on there other than live
wallpaper so pretty cool feature next
thing I want to talk about is s voice
obviously this is one of the biggest new
features on the new TouchWiz and I'll go
ahead and show you how that works I've
done comparisons with teen s voice and
Siri on the channel but I haven't really
done that movie so let's go ahead and
ask it a few questions here what's the
weather like so we got a surveyor let's
try that again what's the weather like
there you go the forecast I can ask it
obviously these are like questions that
you know even voice actions could do and
you know what jelly bean voice Actions
has been really improved in that there's
also a video on that on the channel but
um there's some things that this could
do that voice Actions can't so it's more
conversational for example I could ask
it you know how it's doing how are you
doing I am doing so you can do things
like that um you know I get asked it
what's the best phone in the world
it's a personal choice but Samsung
Galaxy is really cool
so obviously it's gonna say Samsung
galaxys all pretty cool you know it has
all the other features that you know
Voice Actions does but it's more a
little bit more serial Ike The Voice
Actions we're like you know if I'd asked
a personal question like how are you
doing or what's the best phone voice
actually would do a Google search where
this guy actually you know it's more
conversational almost like you're
talking to our actual voice is an
assistant let's go ahead and you know
ask you to set a reminder and I'll go on
with the rest of new features
remind me to walk my dog in 30 minutes
yes so you can see set an alarm for 30
minutes from now
save the tasks and the cool thing is you
can actually scroll through your history
of your conversation so pretty cool
feature here we'll go ahead and exit out
of here honestly it's just as you know
pretty much everywhere all the functions
that you you know expect from voice
actions and a little bit of those Siri
type questions like you know asking you
how it's doing and whatnot so anyway
that's that let's go ahead and go into
the next feature which is motion control
so I've done you know a video on this
with the older version of TouchWiz but I
want to go ahead and show you you know
how these work they actually added a lot
samsung added a lot more motion control
so there's one that's direct call so
this one is basically if you're trying
to call somebody and you have their
contact open actually go ahead and tray
so this is pretty cool we hit learn
about direct call right within the
settings you actually try it out before
actually you know doing it on your own
phone so for example I have a contact
open right now but text message open and
I could actually you know move it up to
my face I'm not actually dead but if you
cover the sensors the you gotta
trick the phone into thinking I am so if
I could do it okay I can't really do it
right now but take my we're basically
when you bring the camera up or the
phone up to your face the proximity
sensor detects your face it closes off
the light and basically it'll
automatically call that contact so it's
go ahead and go back out of here
that's a cool feature there smart alert
which basically you know when your
phone's down and you pick it up it'll
vibrate and you know show you all your
notification there's tap to top of a
list so I'll go ahead and demonstrate
this guy so really cool the memory will
do this within the settings I don't have
to actually go within my contact so
anyway I could go here and this is for
any list on Android contacts just one
example I can just double tap on this
guy and exceeded scrolled up to the very
top so pretty cool I'm actually like
that one
there's tilt to zoom and you know I've
talked about this before let's go ahead
and try it so basically you're looking
at a picture you put two fingers on the
screen and you can just tilt up and down
to zoom in and out so that's another one
you could pan to move what icon around
from screen to screen you could what
else can you to pan to browse images so
this one's kind of different I'll go
ahead and enable it really quick so when
you're looking at a picture what you do
is you put your one finger on the screen
and you can actually move the phone
around and as you can see it's moving to
basically making me feel like you know
the picture I'm looking at basically
this is like a viewfinder but anyway
pretty cool little future there um some
of these are gimmicky honestly like I
don't really need them um some of them
were cool for this for example to shake
to update you shake it so it updates or
Reese cans for devices for on Bluetooth
like really don't really need that turn
over to mute this one's pretty cool at
me if you're playing a song and you just
tilt the phone or turn the phone over
it's gonna automatically pause it but
sometimes it gets annoying because the
speakers look back so I tend to turn my
phone over because I want to hear it
louder and then it actually pauses it so
it kind of basically kind of does the
opposite what I want so I turn that one
off
pama swipe the screen capture that I own
this basically just swipe over like that
and you take a screenshot so another
cool thing but that's pretty much it I
want to talk about motion the next thing
I want to talk about is the power saving
option so I'll go ahead and go into here
and when you turn this guy on so I'll go
ahead and do that you can see the what
it does is it limits the CPU so it
lowers the clock speed it lowers the
screen brightness
background colors and turns off haptic
haptic feedback basically that the
vibration because every time you type
and it vibrates it's gonna be wasting
batteries to get that little
thing going but anyway I'll go ahead and
demonstrate actually I'll show you the
clocks we saw I have set CPU installed
on here and you can see right now my
maximum clock speed is about a thousand
megahertz so basically 1 gigahertz
if I turn this guy off and the cool
thing is I could do it right from here
so by the way the notification bar has
all your you know Wireless toggles right
here so that's definitely a cool feature
of TouchWiz I'll go in turn off power
saving and you can see it's gonna be
jumped up to 1500 so see 1500 max so
pretty cool if you want to save battery
you know lower the clock speed and you
know you get better some of that cards I
mean there's like a lot of v6 cards
which you know basically turn up a few
of the cylinders to conserve gas the
phone does the same thing so that's that
the next thing is the battery percentage
icon you can actually turn it on right
here so it's nice to be able to see you
know how much battery you have just by
glancing at it instead of having to go
within the settings to get the exact
number and again there's a how-to on
that on the channel the other thing is
the LED indicator so you drop hop into
the settings in you could actually
customize the LEDs to you know chart or
light up when you're charging if you
don't want to do that you know turn it
off you can have it you know turn on
when the battery level is getting low
with I don't really see the purpose of
that I mean I feel like it's almost
gonna waste more battery you know having
it notify me
I want to battery's low but you know if
you're not looking the phone that's nice
to see and then obviously you want
missed events like a notification it'll
notify you with that and that's that's
where it makes the most sense but anyway
pretty cool that Samsung actually lets
you customize it it almost gives you the
feeling that it's like a custom ROM I'll
go ahead and show you the home screen
now so you could actually you know edit
now this is like pretty much been on
TouchWiz since of the first galaxy but
basically I can move around home screens
and edit them and delete them as I wish
I could add more home friends but one
what else do you get also do that with
the applications you hit menu and then
you have a few options to do you could
hide certain applications which is
pretty cool so for example if I don't
want some of this bloatware and I can't
uninstall it for example like chaton I
never use it it came pre-loaded on the
phone I can just tap on it hit done and
it actually hides it from my list so
that's definitely a cool feature I'm
having seen that before and I absolutely
loved
being able to hide all the stuff I don't
need so that way you know sure you know
one of the disadvantages is the
bloatware but if you could hide it you
know who really cares obviously some of
it you could actually disable with ICS
or it's started with ICS jellybean is
gonna have it too but anyway you could
disable something apps but anyway that's
a cool feature I'm gonna see if there's
anything else you go to view type and
you know go to a list if you want to be
ordered like this so for some people
find it easier actually like the grid a
lot more but anyway that's that another
thing I want to talk about is the the
face and voice and lock so I did a video
on this as well but it's a pretty cool
house Samsung has these like little new
features too and already great you know
ice cream sandwich so we'll go ahead and
go to security and then screen lock and
then that'll do that they have motion
unlock so I'll go ahead and show you how
quickly how this works so basically put
your finger on it and you tilt it
forward and it's gonna unlock like that
but the other one that's really cool is
the face and voice so yeah face unlock
you know but this is face and voice I
did a video on it so I'm not gonna go
and see here but basically it's gonna
use your face and your voice it's gonna
recognize your voice to be able to
unlock your phone so adds a little bit
more security to face unlock which is
pretty cool
another thing is Oh smart space so it's
going to display and our smart stays and
absolutely you know awesome feature I
actually this is my problem my favorite
feature of the new TouchWiz and it's
right here so basically it disables a
screen timeout if the device detects
that you know your face is looking at
the screen so it's gonna use the
front-facing camera it's gonna watch my
eyes or my face to see if I'm looking if
I'm looking away it'll turn off like
normal if I set it down it'll turn off
so right now screen time what's that one
minute I'm just gonna leave it at 15
seconds and that will go home now I want
you to pay us pointers for my face and
pay attention to the notification bar
because that guy is gonna show a little
eyeball see you right there it's
reliable meaning that it detects that
I'm actually looking at the screen and
it will it'll just stay on it it's only
at 15 seconds and you can see obviously
it's staying longer than 15 seconds now
if I set it down like this and I'll go
it in fast-forward to support because I
don't make you guys wait um I was fast
forward like 15 seconds and see what
happens though and you see you know the
line you have the password the lights
already dimming and it's gonna turn off
you know within a couple
so pretty cool feature I mean that's
part my favorite because you know I've
been I read a lot of stuff on my phone
he's the browser obviously the 4.80
screen like this you're gonna want to
read a lot of stuff or you know browse
the web and if it's turning off you know
every second was while you're using it
and yet the tap it every second it's
pretty annoying so anyway I'm gonna go
ahead and change the settings because
that's gonna annoy the heck out of me
anyway that's another cool feature to
see if there's anything else I mean
that's pretty much it I mean I went over
the the UI oh that's one thing actually
the launcher so the application so not
only can you hide them but if you guys
noticed unlike the regular Ice Cream
Sandwich when you keep scrolling it's
only going through your apps if I tap
widgets it's gonna go through the
widgets I actually prefer this compared
to like the Galaxy Nexus or stock ICS
where you know if I scroll over too much
it goes to the widgets because honestly
most of time I'm not looking for widgets
if I wanted a widget I'll tap it like
that slow sensing I think you know hit
the spot with that um they did a lot
better implementation I hope you know
Google actually implements this with
newer versions of Android but anyway
that's that honestly that's pretty much
it obviously is a pretty long video I
mean over ten minutes so anyway that's
my review or you know just basically
showing you guys the new features of the
new TouchWiz but if you've gone to
helpful please hit the like button and
subscribe I'll be doing more videos like
this actually I did a lot of videos on
the Galaxy s3 but imma be rooting it and
you know installing custom roms so stay
tuned and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
