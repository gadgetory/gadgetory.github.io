to you by $6.00 shirts what's up guys
David here for follow up and welcome
back to this bum bow style comparison
where we're pitting to the hottest
Android smartphones out right now
against one another in the HTC One m8
and the Samsung Galaxy s5 now if you're
new to the channel or don't know exactly
what a phone book style comparison is
basically what we're going to be doing
in this two-part video series is looking
at twenty five reasons why each of these
phones can be considered better than the
other end that way after watching both
you'll have a much better idea as to
which one is better for you let's go
ahead and get right into it
reason number one while especially will
tell you that the 5.1 inch display on
the galaxy s5 is only a tenth of an inch
bigger than the HTC one's in reality
because the s5 doesn't have on-screen
buttons it's usable screen size is
nearly half an inch bigger whenever the
m8 on screen buttons are visible which
is more often than not
- but despite its larger size the galaxy
s5 screen can be easier to use with one
hand with the screen rescaling feature
where you can easily resize the entire
screen to anywhere between three point
five and 4.3 inches diagonally with a
simple swipe in and out from the edge of
the screen 3 another benefit of the S 5
screen is the fact that you can use it
even when you have gloves on which can
be a big advantage if you live in a
colder climate for like I mentioned
earlier the s5 doesn't have on-screen
buttons and instead has a physical home
in two capacitive buttons which in
addition to freeing up screen real
estate can also be used as shortcuts
with the app switcher button acting as a
Menu key and the back button acting as a
multi window toggle when being long
pressed reason number five
speaking of multi window the Galaxy S
five allows you to use two apps on the
screen at the same time giving you a
significantly better multitasking
experience than anything you can get on
the HTC One 6 with a 16 megapixel sensor
the Galaxy s5s camera has four times the
resolution found on the HTC ones making
for much sharper and more detailed
photos 7 but it's not just the photos
that benefit from the high pixel count
as the galaxy s5 can also record videos
at up to 4k resolution which again is
four times higher than the HTC one's
1080
be eight while 4k video and 16 megapixel
photos are great they do end up creating
larger file sizes but thankfully Samsung
equipped the galaxy s5 with a USB 3.0
port which when connected to a computer
not only transfers files faster but also
charges up the battery quicker than the
USB 2.0 port found on the Asian c-19
because the power button sits at right
about where your thumb naturally rests
the Galaxy s5 is much easier to turn on
and off compared to the HTC One where
the power button is someone in
conveniently placed all the way up top
reason number 10 love it or hate it the
Galaxy s5 is made out of mostly plastic
but the advantage of using plastic is
the phone ends up being a lot lighter
thinner and is generally more grippy
than the mostly metal HTC 111 and on top
of that the plastic build allows for the
s5 to have a removable back cover which
opens the door to Samsung's wireless
charging kit that when installed allows
you to charge the galaxy s5 without ever
having to plug it in 12 but the back
cover isn't the only thing that's
removable as the 21 hundred million
battery is removable as well giving you
the opportunity to either swap it out
with a fully charged spare or even get
an extended battery if you so desire 13
unlike the HTC One the galaxy s5 is ip67
certified meaning that it is both dust
and water resistant which can
potentially save your phone from getting
damaged due to the elements 14 with
Samsung's s finder feature you can
search through your entire phone to find
exactly what you're looking for
regardless of whether what you're
looking for is in a contact a calendar
event a notes an app a text message or
just about anything else you can think
of all from one convenient place reason
number 15 so that home button we're
talking about earlier isn't just a home
button it's also a fingerprint scanner
which allows you to securely unlock the
s5 with a swipe of a finger and not just
that it can also be used as a password
for apps like PayPal 16 with the toolbox
feature on the Galaxy S 5 you can have a
persistent floating menu on the screen
wherever you go giving you access to up
to five customizable apps making
switching back and forth between them
quick and easy 17 with the Galaxy s5s
private mode you can hide just about any
file on your phone like a picture or
video for example which will only be
visible
to you when the password-protected
private mode is enabled 18 another mode
on the galaxy s5 is easy mode which may
not be something you fumble to ever use
but it's a great feature for those who
aren't as tech-savvy with it converting
the phone into a super simple interface
with extra large text 19 if you ever run
into some kind of emergency on the
galaxy s5 you can triple press the power
button to have the phone automatically
send a text message to the people on
your emergency contact list giving them
your location a picture from the front
and rear cameras and a sound recording
so that way they can get an idea of
what's actually happening to you reason
number 20 speaking of emergencies you
might just be able to avoid one by
staying on top of your health with the
Galaxy s5s built-in heart rate monitor
and s health app where you can not only
measure your heart rate but also keep
track of your diet and exercise
21 unlike the HTC One in the galaxy s5
settings you have a dedicated menu for
your phone's default applications which
make managing your default apps like a
browser or even a custom launcher a
little bit easier 22 when you have a
missed notification and pick the galaxy
s5 up it'll automatically vibrate
letting you know about it so that way
you won't have to turn the screen on and
off every time you grab your phone in
order to check for missed notifications
23 on the topic of notifications the
galaxy s5 notification shade offers easy
access to up to nine customizable
toggles while also giving you quick
control over your displays brightness
whereas on the HTC One S notification
shade you only get a button for quick
settings 24 if you're the type of person
who still makes and receives voice calls
every now and again you'll appreciate
the incall options found on the galaxy
s5 which range from a non obtrusive way
of notifying you of a call when you're
using an app to being able to record a
memo with the call information
automatically filled in all right we're
finally here
reason number 25 unlike the HTC One on
the galaxy s5 you can interact with the
screen without ever having to physically
touch it with air view interview lets
you get pop-up previews of what your
finger is hovering over which can be
helpful in certain situations like when
you're trying to remember which speed
dial number was assigned to who without
having to actually dial it in order to
find
all right so that's it for the galaxy s5
version of this video and if you haven't
seen the HTC ones version yet
it'll be annotated somewhere on this
screen or link down in the description
but before I leave you I want to give a
big shout out to the sponsor for today's
video in $6.00 shirts so a lot of you
guys have asked me about these shirts
that I wear in some of my videos like
the one I'm wearing right now or this
one or even this one end
I've actually been buying them from
$6.00 shirts before they became a
sponsor for the show and as you can
probably guess from their name these
shirts cost just $6 so if you want a
shirt like this one or what from the
hundreds of designs available click on
that personally down in the description
get yourself an amazing deal and help
support the channel in the process
alright guys thank you for watching and
I'll catch you guys in the very next
