Bumba and in this video series we're
gonna be helping you decide between will
probably end up being to the top android
smartphones in 2013 and the HTC one and
the Samsung Galaxy s4 now ultimately no
one phone is the best phone for
everybody each of us has our own
different wants and needs so I believe
that there's no better way in figuring
out which phone is best for you than
these type of videos so let's go over
not five nope not even ten but twenty
five reasons why the HTC One is better
than the galaxy s4 now Samsung fans
don't worry there'll be a video just
like this in favor of the s4 coming in
the near future so make sure you
subscribe to that but in this video is
the HTC one's time to shine and with
that said let's go ahead and get right
into it
reason number one the HTC One has a
beautiful all-metal build that just
screams quality everything from its
unibody design to is chamfered edges
makes the phone feel very high-end which
is something that you can't really say
about the galaxy s4 is plastic material
to the one has dual stereo front-facing
speakers audio is directional so it just
makes complete sense that the phone
speakers face you while you do things
like watching videos on YouTube for
example three not only are the two
speakers front-facing but they're also
louder and more importantly they deliver
better audio quality with built in amps
compared to the galaxy s4 single rear
speaker
for and as if that weren't enough HTC
made the audio experience both on the
speakers and on headphones even better
with the addition of Beats Audio which
really helps make your music popular
more reason number five
unlike the Galaxy s4 the HTC one's
front-facing camera has a wide angle
lens meaning that you can fit more into
the frame which makes it easier to take
self-portraits or video chat six
speaking of wide-angle lens the ones
rear camera fits a lot more into the
frame as well allowing you to take
pictures without having to back away
from your subject as often as you would
on the galaxy s4 seven since we're
talking cameras the ones ultra pixel
camera offers you superior low-light
performance meaning pictures you take in
darker scenes like when you're indoors
or at night come out looking better than
they would on the galaxy s4 eight in
addition to its better low-light
performance the HTC One has optical
image stabilization where there are
little Springs that help absorb the
movement of shaky hands which helps make
your pictures and videos come out
looking a little bit smoother 9 with HTC
Zoe the ones camera captures 20 still
photo frames along with three seconds of
video one second of which is before you
even press the shutter button which
helps ensure you never miss those
special moments even when you press the
button later than you should have reason
number 10 in the camera app on the HTC
One you also have the option to record
slow motion videos which allows for
variable speed playback in other words
you can record a video and slow down
just the right parts you want to make
your videos a little bit more epic 11
video highlights like the name suggests
highlights is a unique feature that
turns an ordinary day in your life into
its own little movie it does this all on
the fly adding awesome effects and
background music automatically that go
hand in hand with the media that you've
selected 12 with the great speakers and
camera features I just mentioned you can
rest at ease knowing that the ones 1080p
display has a higher pixel density at
469 PPI compared to the galaxy s4 is 441
making the HTC One screen one of the
best if not the best screen out there on
the market 13 of course with the PPI
that hide the difference isn't really
noticeable to the human eye however the
brighter and more natural colors on the
ones Super LCD 3d display compared to
that force along with this better
outdoor visibility definitely r14 with
such a great screen HTC did a really
good job I'm making sure it's Sense 5 UI
looked more polished less cartoony and
generally more consistent than the
TouchWiz UI you'd find on the galaxy s4
while this one could obviously come down
to personal preference most people agree
that the ones UI just looks a little bit
cleaner than the Galaxy s4 does reason
number 15 in line with HTC's effort for
a better looking UI the one comes with
significantly more HD static wallpapers
live wallpapers and widgets pre-loaded
on the phone that again really shows the
effort HTC made in regards to design 16
if you've seen the how to make Android
faster video on the phonebook channel
you know that restarting your phone
every once in a while can be beneficial
and with HTC's fastboot optimizations
everything from shutting down to loading
up the Android OS is faster than the one
than it is on the galaxy s4 17 blink
feed with blink feed you get a personal
live stream of what's most important to
you right on your home screen you can
customize the speed to include news from
the sources you want social media
updates from the accounts you want and
much more 18 kind of how blink feed
aggravates news and social updates on
your home screen the gallery app on the
HTC One can show you pictures and videos
from your online and social accounts
meaning you can see all of your friends
albums in the same app that you would
view your own in 19 while the one
doesn't have expandable storage like the
s4 does it comes with double the amount
of memory at about the same price point
as in for around $200 on contract you
get a 16 gigabyte galaxy s4 while for
the same price you get a 32 gigabyte HTC
one reason number 20 on the subject of
price the HTC One can be purchased for
as low as five hundred and seventy-five
dollars at full retail compared to the
over $650 for the Galaxy s4 and this is
comparing the 32 gigabyte one to only
the 16 gigabyte galaxy s4 21
multitasking view on the one you can see
up to 9 apps at once in your
multitasking window without scrolling
compared to the only three or four you
can see on the s4 which can help you get
in and out of apps just a little bit
quicker 22 while the galaxy s4 and the
HTC One
offer you data usage details allowing to
see how much data you used in a
particular cycle the one takes this one
step further giving you a breakdown of
your minutes and your messages as well
23 these are big phones we're talking
about so little things like being able
to swipe to the left and right to
navigate through apps and settings is a
definite advantage the HTC One has over
the Galaxy s4 things like switching from
the rear to the front camera is done
with a simple swipe to the left as is
navigating through your contacts or
phone app or other apps like the clock
and alarm which does make it a little
bit easier to use the phone with just
one hand compared to the tab interface
on the galaxy s4 where you have to reach
all the way to the top of the screen to
navigate between tabs 24 on the
international or unlocked versions of
the HTC One kiss mode is integrated
right into the OS which lets you give
your phone to a kids play on without
having to worry about them getting into
anything else
alright we're finally here reason number
25 on the HTC One if you do happen to
run low on space you can go into the
settings and use the make more space
feature that clears our application
cache and gives you the option to
uninstall apps or delete media all in
one convenient place reason number 26
and up can be found in a link to form of
calm right below the like button of this

than the S board that we didn't mention

us know alright guys that is it for me
