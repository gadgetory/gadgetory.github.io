very exciting video for you today with
the best of Apple and the iPhone 6s plus
the best of Google and the Nexus 6p and
the best of Microsoft in the lumia 950xl
all going at it head-to-head in a phone
book style speed test let's go ahead and
get right into it
all right so we'll kick this thing off
by starting these stop watches on each
phone and head into these system apps
where the Nexus 6p jumps into the lead
with his quick animations with the
iPhone 6s plus right behind it and the
lumia 950xl
falling into third place with its slow
start but all three phones are still
working on the same app with the iPhone
6s plus just blazing through Temple Run
2 already working on Angry Birds with
the Nexus 6p falling into second and the
Lumia 950 chugging along trying to make
a comeback but it's got his work cut out
for it as the iPhone is showing no signs
of slowing down just ripping through
this virtual obstacle course pulling
itself a full app ahead of the two
Snapdragon 810 packing smart phones
which are actually now neck and neck
with the Lumia 950 pulling ahead of the
Nexus if only by a split second so this
is still anybody's race especially
considering that we still have another
full lap to go
speaking of the iPhone is on the last
leg of this first lap loading up the
full version of the Amazon website as
the Nexus 6p jumps back into second
place ahead of the Lumia 950 working on
the Netflix app so the iPhone 6s plus
with its dual core a nine ship finish
that first lap in less than a minute
with a time of 58 seconds while the
octa-core Nexus 6p is still trying to
get some separation between it and the
similarly spec lumia 950xl
finishing up the first lap with a time
of 1 minute and 17 seconds meanwhile the
iPhone has just been cruising through
the second lap basically lapping the
lumia 950xl which finishes the first lap
in the same amount of time that it took
the iphone to finish boat labs at 1
minute and 23 seconds so now the battle
is for second place with both the Nexus
and the Lumia having to reload Temple
Run 2 despite having 3 gigabytes RAM
which the 2 gigabyte packin iPhone 6s
had ready to go in the background really
showcasing iOS optimus
patience but it is worth noting that
both the Lumia and the Nexus are pushing
way more pixels on their displays than
the iPhone which may or may not have had
an impact on their performance but
either way it looks like both phones had
at least some apps opening in the
background with the Nexus 6p just about
done with this second lap with the
browser ready to go in the background
and finishing with a total time of 2
minutes in 4 seconds with the Lumia 950
finishing 6 seconds later with a time of
2 minutes and 10 seconds making the
winner and still fumble style speed test
champ the iPhone 6s plus all right guys
thank you for watching and I'll see you
in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
