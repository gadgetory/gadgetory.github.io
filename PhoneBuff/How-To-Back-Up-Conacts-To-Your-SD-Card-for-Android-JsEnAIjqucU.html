today i'm going to show you how to store
your contacts onto your SD card you do
need to have android 2.1 or higher in
order to be able to do this but most
phones nowadays do have version 2.1 or
higher so without further ado i'll go
ahead and show you how to do it you're
gonna go into your people app or
contacts depending on your phone model
but in this case is people and from your
people app you're going to hit menu and
then import/export so this one has a
little picture of an SD card right there
on it and it gives you two outcomes you
get imported from an SD card so if you
had already stored contacts onto the SD
card you want to get him back but in
this case we're gonna export because you
want to see them onto the SD card it's
gonna give you options to select which
account you want to sync the contact
with so in this case I'll do my Gmail
because that's where all my contacts are
it says are you sure you want to do it
and then you just hit OK and you can see
it's exporting all my contacts right
there to my SD card so I'll be able to
you know swap the SD card and put into
another phone and be able to get my
contacts on the phone without even
having to sync my Google account but
that's pretty much it this is David
