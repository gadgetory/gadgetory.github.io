and I'm gonna be doing a quick video on
how to use metamorph and how to flash a
metamorph I'll just let you guys know
you do need to be routed so do that
before you do anything else the next
step in the process of course
downloading the file you actually want
to flush and downloading metamour from
the Android Market and once you've done
that hit menu and then go to settings go
to applications development and make
sure that the USB debugging box is
actually checked so mine's already
checked and we'll leave it the way it is
and make sure yours looks like that as
well and then load up metamorph so load
it up I said I had to open in the
background I'm gonna show you what it
looks like when you first open it up so
you get a little popup window saying
they need to make sure that the device
meets all the requirements
so it started tracks baseball is doing
is giving it super user permissions and
you could hit either unzip or extract a
new theme or pick an existing theme what
I want to switch out is my battery icon
so I have this one right now it's a
circular icon with the percentage in the
middle and I like it but I want to
switch it with one that matches my theme
a little bit better so I've already had
it before so I'm gonna go to pick
existing theme and it's the minimal mat
so let's hit go ahead and click on it
it'll it'll act the same way whether you
do a new theme or an old one who gave
you this pop-up menu and then you just
say it apply all so it apply and says
are you sure basically it's a warning it
continue and let it load it could range
for for how long it takes a load it
could be anywhere from 30 seconds to you
know 2 to 3 minutes depending on how
large the file you're flashing is
but for something as simple as a battery
icon it should take around I don't know
35 to 40 seconds so now it's asked me to
reboot now sometimes it doesn't ask you
to reboot it just kind of does it
automatically and from my experience
it's fine it still works and I've even
had it get stuck in the boot up
animation before I had to pull out the
battery put it back in but in it up it
ended up working so don't freak out if
that happens to you but you know as
always make sure you back everything up
before you make any changes to your
phone because you never know what could
go go wrong so we'll just wait for it to
load up so we can see if the if the
change occurred and by the way I am
running the trigger 3.2 final ROM and
there's a review on phone woof comm if
you guys want to check it out for the
Samsung Vibrant alright looks like this
loaded up show you my battery icon as
you can see it is different now and it's
one that actually matches my theme
better so yeah that's pretty much it
thank you for watching the video and
don't forget to visit bomba comm for
more cellphone news reviews and how to's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
