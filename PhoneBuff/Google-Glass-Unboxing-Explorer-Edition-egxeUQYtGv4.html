buff and in this video I have a very
exciting unboxing for you guys with
Google glass so earlier this year I was
invited into Google's Explorer program
for glass and just last week I had the
opportunity to go out to one of Google's
campuses in Los Angeles to pick up this
Explorer edition of glass which came in
this black bag here so inside the bag
you have this main box which has the
actual unit inside of it and then you
have these two smaller boxes for the
attachable shades and shields taking a
look around the main box and you'll
notice that google win with a very
simplistic design just white black with
nothing but a sticker on the top left
letting you know that this unit is an
explorer edition of glass list the color
which in this case is charcoal black and
tells you the box is made up of 100%
paper with a little joke letting you
know that you can write a letter to your
grandma or otherwise recycle it the two
smaller boxes for the shays and shield
have that same simplistic design as the
main box with nothing but a picture of
what's inside and a couple of glass
logos okay so I'll unbox the shades and
the shields in just a minute but right
now I'm gonna get straight into unboxing
what you guys have been waiting for so
without any further ado I'll go ahead
and pull off this top cover and just to
be straightforward with you guys I want
to let you know that I actually did
unbox this once before when I was at
Google for a little bit of training but
I did manage to keep everything intact
so it looks just as a would when its
brand new so for right now I'll go ahead
and move off the Google glass unit to
the side and first thing you see inside
the box is this microfiber cloth type
pouch that you can actually put glass
into for protection you know glass
doesn't Bend like a normal glasses so
definitely something nice to have don't
know if I'll use it all that often but
definitely think I should anyways the
next thing you see inside the box is
this micro USB to USB cable which just
like the Box on the outside is white on
one side and black on the other the wire
itself is all black but the little ends
are white and black and the charging
brick same story you have black on the
bottom and white on the top so it's kind
of cool to see you know this simplistic
design going throughout the whole Google
glass experience last thing inside the
box is this little envelope here which
comes with some paperwork of course and
it actually comes with some differ
sighs nosepads so you can get that
Custom Fit going for you with Google
glass which definitely something nice to
see because you know if it's not
comfortable you probably won't wear it
but that is pretty much it for the box
like I promised we'll go ahead and unbox
the shields in the shades so when I
first ones at Google's campus
I don't know these things were called
shields so I was wondering why Google
even included them but after the Google
employee told me that there are called
shields it made perfect sense I mean if
you have a convertible car or if you
drive a motorcycle and you want to use
Google glass at night which I don't know
if it's the best idea but anyway you
want to use them at night having these
clear almost goggle type shields makes
perfect sense cuz it protects your eyes
from the wind and also lets you actually
use glass without you know drying your
eyes up but I didn't think about it it's
nice that Google did I mean kind of
shows you that you know just like with
the nose pads they're thinking of
everybody so that way you could actually
use this you know in real life not just
you know in theory but here it is it
comes in this microfiber cloth you know
pouch almost just like with the actual
pouch I showed you earlier you see the
Google glass logo in the middle and now
pulling them out they're just clear and
go ahead and show you the shades because
these are what I'm actually gonna be
using more often than not so as you can
see these look like your typical shades
with the exception of course that
they're made to custom-fit to Google
Plus so on the back you have this XC
logo which stands for Explorer edition
on the top right you have this curvature
which is used to wrap around the actual
glass unit and speaking of which I want
to show you how to attach it because I
did find it a little bit tricky so we're
says XC there's actually a little ridges
where the bands on Google glass will
actually wrap around so you put it in
vertically turn it slowly to the right
because you are gonna be kind of
stretching the bands and once you get it
all the way up there they actually snap
back to give you that good snug fit all
right so with the unboxings out of the
way and the shades on we're ready to do
the product tour so first thing we'll
take a look at is the front of course
where you'll see the actual glass and
Google glass where the display is shown
and to the left of it you see that
wide-angled five megapixel camera on the
right side of glass the portion that
would sit right behind your ear is where
the battery stored and towards the front
you have the touch panel which is
actually all touch sensitive all the way
into that line that separates it from
the camera on the inside of the right
you have a sensor that detects whether
or not you're wearing it you have a
power button to turn glass
on and off and lastly you have a speaker
that actually vibrates sound into your
skull so you could hear up top you have
nothing but a button that you can press
to take pictures or hold to record
videos at the bottom you have your micro
USB port for charging and data transfer
and finally at the back of the right you
have an LED light that lets you know
when you turn the device on and off as
for the rest of glass you have a
titanium band the wraps all the way
around to your other ear on the left
side of which says designed by Google
and manufactured in California and
lastly you have these nose pads which
are adjustable by pinching oh and one
more thing when you actually look at the
glass piece from the left side it acts
like a little mirror which is something
that was pretty cool okay so there's
just a quick look at Google glass and I
have to tell you I'm super excited to
have the opportunity to use these things
on a daily basis then I know you guys
are excited about it too so if you guys
have any questions tweet me at foam buff
and I try to get back to as many of you
guys as I possibly can I'll put the
links to Twitter and phone books other
social media right below the like button

tweeting but that's pretty much it for

you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
