in this video I'm doing a size
comparison with the samsung galaxy note
on AT&amp;amp;T so normally i do my size
comparisons and each phones respective
review but considering the fact that the
note is such a big phone at five point
three inches i did want to compare it to
some of the other devices out there in
the market so with that said i'll go
ahead and bring in the probably the most
popular Android handset right now which
is the Samsung Galaxy Nexus this guy's a
four point six five inch screen and I
remember when this guy first came out a
lot of people are saying that this phone
is huge so I'm going to put them side by
side just to give you a better idea as
far as how big the note is in comparison
so I mean just by looking at that you
can kind of tell that the Galaxy Nexus
almost looks like a child's phone
compared to the Galaxy Note but let's go
ahead and bring in another phone which
is the iphone 4s this is a 3.5 inch
screen and we'll go ahead and put it
right next to the galaxy note or a
Galaxy Nexus and again you can see the
size difference I mean it's just a huge
jump from the iphone 4s to the Galaxy
Nexus and pretty much the same jump from
the Galaxy Nexus to the Galaxy Note i'll
go ahead and show you the size of a
credit card just in case you don't have
any of these phones here's a standard
credit card and this is the size that
you're looking at so for example the
screen size of the iphone 4s is just
about the size of the credit card of
course the Galaxy Nexus screen is bigger
and then you've got your galaxy note I
get this guy off of here which is a lot
bigger than the credit card so I'll go
ahead and put these three devices side
by side just to show you how thick each
phone is so put them side-by-side the
Galaxy Nexus does kind of curve so it's
kind of harder to measure it but you
know from the looks of it I'd say that
the galaxy note is actually the finished
so it is really big but it does make up
for it with its thinnest we'll do a
side-by-side with just the Nexus and
then just type on so hopefully this guys
coming through
camera are pretty good um like you can
see the bottom of the Nexus is a little
bit thicker than the top the top is
thinner but overall you know out say
that the galaxy note is thinner and
let's go ahead and compare it to the
iphone 4s and these two are close again
but the Galaxy Note does have a curved
back so it curves a little bit giving
the illusion that it's thinner and
actually I think it is but that's
basically just a quick comparison that I
wanted to do with the phones and you
know in the hand the iphone 4s you know
is the easiest to use I'd say as far as
one-handed use I could reach every
corner of the screen with relative ease
galaxy nexus of course you know it isn't
that bad for me I can reach just about
every corner I kind of have to stretch a
little to get this top left corner if
I'm holding the phone like this so it is
a little bit tougher and the galaxy note
i mean you pretty much do need to
address the phone i mean you're not
going to get with one-handed use all the
times I mean this is my you see my
finger is stretched yep to the 6 and you
know I'm supposed to be able to get up
to here so that just gives you a better
idea as far as what you can expect when
you get your hands on the Galaxy Note
