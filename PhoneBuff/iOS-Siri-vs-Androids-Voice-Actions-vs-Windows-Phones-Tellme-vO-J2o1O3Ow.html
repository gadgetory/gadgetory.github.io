in this video I'll be comparing iOS to
Siri
to Android voice Actions to Microsoft
Windows Phones
tell me service and basically I'm just
going to be running a few tests to
determine which one works the best and
at the end of each test I'll let you
know you know which phone worked or
which phones worked and which phone did
not so with that said let's go ahead and
run the tests so I have to press the
Android phone first because it doesn't
have a button take a press and hold to
activate voice command where these to do
so I'll go ahead and do that and run our
first test so I'm gonna ask the phone
for weather weather all right so you can
see that the iPhone and Siri loaded up
the weather perfectly on here on Android
you load up perfectly as well and it
loaded up perfectly on Windows Phone as
as well so don't take in the speed into
consideration here because this Windows
Phone is only running a single core 1
Giga processor so it's definitely more
of a dated phone then these two guys
which reflect you know the newer higher
end devices available in each platform
so for right now all to be worked and
let's go to the next test so in this
test I will ask the phone for movies
movies alright so looks like the iPhone
again it worked perfectly Andrew it
again work perfectly giving me my
theaters just like the iPhone did and in
this case it looks like Bing or telling
me just loaded up a local search for
movies which shows up you know has one
movie theater showed up but it doesn't
show all the other movie theaters so
it's not actual show times so what we
could do is rephrase the question on all
three phones again and this time last
four movies show times instead of just
movies movie show times
I found eleven three cheaters four
fairly close to you so the same results
on both the iPhone with Siri and Android
voice Actions and in this case on
Windows Phone and tell me it worked the
way it should have the first time and we
have our movie show times and we just
click on them and get the Showtime for
the whatever movie we're looking at all
right so the first test with the movies
only the Android phone and the iOS one
worked where the Microsoft Windows Phone
did not but on the second test all three
work so that means me to my next test
all right so in this next test I'm gonna
ask each phone a little math question to
see if they can answer them so I'll hit
this guy 5 plus 5 plus 10 all right so
the Siri
our Siri got the answer right saying 20
Google Voice Actions got the answer
right saying 20 and the tell me service
search 5 foot 5 foot 10 so what I do
know is that you know tell me doesn't
yet support anything like these to do so
in this case I OS and Android 1 where
Windows Phone did not all right let's go
to the next test which is sending a
reminder so I'm just gonna ask each
phone to remind me to eat in 15 minutes
remind me to eat in 15 minutes alright
so you can see Siri worked it's making a
reminder for me the Android phone only
did a Google search and the Windows
Phone did a Bing search so in this case
the iPhone and Siri win and the you know
voice Actions and time we did not so
let's go on to the next test which are
actually you know what I'll go ahead and
rephrase that question again so instead
of saying remind me to eat I'll just say
remind our set alarm in 15 minutes on
every phone so
that alarm in 15 minutes okay alright so
in this case I worked on Siri and on the
Android phone and it did not work on
tell me and the Windows Phone so these
two tie and this one looses and let's go
on to the next test now which is to ask
it when was Martin Luther King born so
we'll ask each phone when was Martin
Luther King born all right so on the
Android phone we have a direct answer
saying January 15th 1999 same thing on
Siri we got january 15 1929 and on the
telephone or Windows Phone we only got a
Bing search and we could actually see
the answer within the search results
just like you could on this Google
search over here but it's not a direct
answer like you get on both Siri and
Android voice Actions so I'll have to
say that Siri and Voice Actions wins and
again tell me losses in this test and
then the next test I'm gonna do is
asking for directions to Best Buy so
directions to Best Buy
all right so this case looks like the
Android phone got the directions that I
needed same with Syria and the Windows
Phone in this case did not so again
Android and iOS win with Siri and voice
Actions and when this one will tell me
loses in this case so we'll go ahead and
hit home on each of these devices and
we'll go to the final test and this one
kind of shows you the strength of Siri
compared to the other two and I'm just
gonna add I'm just gonna say I'm drunk
and see which each phone says so I'm
neither of us is driving alright so as
you can see you just got a Google search
for I'm drunk on the Android phone you
got a Bing search on the Windows Phone
and on the iPhone with Siri you actually
have the option to call a taxi so so
definitely more useful in that case so
overall I have to say that Siri is the
best of the three
voice command systems on each OS but you
know androids actually a lot closer to
most people would think because series
tends to be you know a lot more
glorified than Android voice Actions are
but the Android voice Actions for me you
know are just as functional as Siri I'll
say overall the voice recognition is a
little bit better on series than it is
on Android but as you can see from these
tests you know these two phones are
really close to where the Windows Phone
and tell me tends to fall behind a
little bit so we'll have to see what
Microsoft does in the future about that
and see how you know Google responds to
series challenge alright that's it for
me in this video this is David fumble
