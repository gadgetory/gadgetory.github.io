calm and spin I'm gonna show you how to
make an android backup on your phone so
obviously a first things first you have
to be rooted and after I have a custom
recovery installed like clockwork mod
I'm gonna go ahead and show you how to
do it so what you're going to do is
you're going to boot in to recovery mr.
music ROM manager do that really quick
so I'm just going to boot into
clockworkmod recovery I didn't feel like
doing the little combination there's
also a video a how-to video on the
channel if you want to learn how to do
it you know the other way by using the
app you know volume button power button
together anyway we're here and once here
over here what you're going to want to
do is it's pretty simple actually you
just go down to backup and restore so
I'm using the volume up and down buttons
to go up and down and once I want to
select one I highlight it and I'm gonna
press the power key so my hit power on
right here backup and restore so backup
and restore and then you're just going
to go to backup to internal sdcard now I
don't have an external sdcard installed
so obviously this is my only option but
I'm going to go ahead and tap on this
and you can see now it's backing up so
this does take a while and it really
depends on how much information you have
on your phone I don't have all that much
so it shouldn't take me that long but
really it does take you know over you
know could be anywhere between like 3 to
10 or maybe even 15 minutes depending on
your phone but just be patient wait for
it to finish and now let's go ahead and
skip to the part when it's done alright
so as you can see it is done it only
took about 3 minutes or so for my phone
um now I'm just gonna go ahead and
reboot phone so I'm gonna hit power you
can see the reboot system now was
highlighted let's go power up then I'm
going to show you um what you want to do
with the actual file that are actual
backup file and um while just loading up
I'll let you guys know that I you want
to do this like right after you root
your phone unless that's how I do it I
just routed my phone and I do this in
Android backups that way you know when I
would go out and you know flash custom
kernels flash custom roms in case
anything goes wrong while I'm messing
with it
you know it doesn't really have
something to go back on which is you
know the stock rom with the root access
so anyway this guy is done loading I'll
go ahead and show you where you want to
do with the backup file so I want I'm
gonna go ahead and my file explorer so
you see clockworkmod has now made a
folder I tap on this guy this is backup
and there you go now you have this
little backup folder now this folder
right here you actually want to maybe
connect your phone to your computer and
transfer this over to transfer this guy
over to your computer so that way you
never lose it just in case somehow it
gets deleted especially when it's on
your internal storage like that so put
it on your computer but it's somewhere
safe maybe even email it to yourself so
that way it's saved on your email
account because you don't want to lose
it because that's really you know your
backup just in case you ever mess up
your phone you're going to be able to
you know put this guy back on your phone
in do an Android restore so speaking of
named restore I'm gonna go ahead and
show you how to do that I'm going to rob
manager and boot into recovery really
quick and I'll go ahead and show you how
to do the restore so the restore again
is pretty much just as easy to doing the
backup you just go to the restore option
but I'll go ahead and show you anyways
alright so here we are I'm just going to
be using the volume keys again to scroll
so I'm gonna be going down to backup
restore same place we went earlier but
this time instead of going down to
backup I'm gonna hit restores so we're
gonna go is not to the regular restore
in my case because I didn't put it on my
SD card I don't have one in there so
it's not my internal so what you want to
do is hit the restore from internal sd
card I'll tap on this guy and you can
see right there's a time step for that
file that I just backed up I would tap
this guy and that it would restore my
phone and then after you're done you
just hit reboot system now and you'd be
done but obviously I can do that because
I just back it up and there's nothing
wrong with my phone so anyway that is
how you do it as I do a backup and
restore for an Android on the staple
