and in this we're gonna be unboxing the
brand new nokia lumia 920 from AT&amp;amp;T have
the box here as you can see on the top
of the box with nothing but a little 18t
globe sticker reminding us that there's
a $35 restocking fee on the bottom we
see it says Nokia Lumia 920 same thing
over here on the right side we have our
typical you know serial numbers and then
on the left side of this we you can see
the different device colors and you see
there's a little silver sticker online
on white because that's the color I got
on the bottom of the actual box we have
a picture of the Nokia Lumia 920 some
more branding and that's pretty much it
for the outside of the box let's go
ahead and open this guy up so flip it
open H&amp;amp;T did slip in a micro sim card
for me here and first thing we'll see is
the quick start guide you can see the
ATT club again Nokia Lumia 920 who
really cares about all that stuff what
we're looking for is the phone and you
know first impression the phone it's
definitely a lot heavier I'm have been
playing you know with the galaxy s3 for
a while the iphone 5 even the note 2 and
this one definitely feels heavier I
haven't looked at the specs as far as
which one actually is heavier but does
feel heavier but it does feel really
really solid feels well built I mean
pretty much like it was on the Nokia
Lumia 900 off except for this time it
doesn't have that matte finish has more
of a shiny finish like it is sort of on
the galaxy s3 but let's go ahead and do
a quick little tour of the device after
we're finished unboxing the rest of this
so see we have a little whoops we have a
little sticker right over here covering
this little sim card tool that we're
going to use to pop in our micro sim we
open it up box up further we have a
sticker for NFC says touch to connect so
says touch the upper back of your phone
to this NFC tag so some little NFC tag
pretty cool right here we have a
basically a little flyer telling us
where we can learn more about the phone
got our product and safety information
here got a USB wall charger here looks
pretty nice rounded the little USB
or is on the side and of course last
thing we have is our USB cable which we
can plug into the computer or of course
to charge it up no headphones included
so that's pretty much it on the box
let's go ahead and look at the device
itself so move the stuff out of the way
bring the device back into the screen
and we'll go ahead and power it up so
press and hold the side button you can
see the buttons are black on the volume
rocker for the power button and the
camera on the left side we have
absolutely nothing the top we have our
microphone 3.5 million headphone jack I
said microphone sorry the microphone
drove over here 3.5 million or headphone
jack is over here and we have our micro
sim card slot but basically you know I
can just show you the back and the
little sticker tells you everything is
so the headphone jack we have the sim
card slot got our volume buttons the
power/lock button of course dedicated
camera button which is standard on all
windows phones the micro USB charging
port at the bottom with our speaker
grilles and that's pretty much it on the
device so you can see it's still loading
up we'll go ahead and take off this
protective little layer here so that's
coming off you can see it says sim error
because i haven't inserted my sim as you
guys can see I had it on the box says
welcome to your Windows Phone get
started what language I want I want
English we'll go ahead and ignore that
for now accept and I was do recommended
settings and at this point I'm just
going to keep hitting next and next
trying to skip through this I could show
you the actual phone itself so while
that's loading I will take we don't want
final 360 look at the device definitely
looks like a really nice nicely built
device on of course the camera on the
back of the phone is the carl zeiss lens
with the up you know it's a peer of your
camera 8.7 megapixels with optical image
stabilization so the difference between
you know digital and optical
stabilization is optical actually it's
going on in the phone it's not just some
kind of software thing so when you're
walking around recording videos
technically it should be a lot smoother
because there's gonna be a little spring
kind of moving the the lens with you so
that way it kind of absorbs the shock so
setting up your phone a few more apps
you need to finish installing just hit
next on that underneath the hood we
a dual-core Snapdragon s4 processor I
know might not seem a lot considering
all the quad core phones were seeing but
really excited to see a duel because
honestly a single core was doing just
fine on windows phone they added a dual
core they doubled up the ramp to one
gigabyte and of course the added NFC two
thousand million of batteries so we're
going to see how well that is pretty
interesting to see you know how the
battery life is going to be under is
considering that the display is a 4.5
inch IPS display with a resolution of
1280 by 768 giving you a ppi of around
331 so definitely going to be one of the
sharper displays on the market I'm
really interested about the screen I'm
and that's one of the main reasons I was
excited about getting this phone because
it does have that you know IPS display
and it looks really really good from
what i've seen online of course this is
my first time actually using the device
in person and when i saw at the store
but we're still waiting on this thing
i'll just go ahead and skip to when it's
done all right so it says all apps have
finished installing that took a really
long time took like two and a half three
minutes so longer than i've ever seen on
a phone why it took so long maybe so
that i have a sim card in but there you
go windows phone 8 is running on this
Lumia 920 of course that's one of the
main things about it because it is one
of the first devices out there with
Windows Phone 8 so you can see right now
set to that Nokia blue theme and as you
can tell everything looks super super
smooth of course I'm gonna be going more
into that in the review really quick
though i'm going to show you let's go
ahead and see if we can actually take a
look at look at the calculator really
quick and get an idea as far as the
speed of the device are how smooth it is
open up calendar and you see everything
smooth virtually no lag at all we'll go
ahead and remove the sticker off the
back here so try to take this guy off
and there you go and there is the back
looks pretty darn clean take off this
little lens cover and there you go so
this is the Nokia Lumia 920 that's
pretty much it for me and it's unboxing

top Android phones and of course the
iPhone 5 but anyway that's pretty much
