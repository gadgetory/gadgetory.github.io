we're checking out how the only voice
assistant from the makers of SoundHound
and specifically looking at ten things
that Hound can do that both Google now
and Siri currently can't but before we
get into it I want to give a quick shout
out to a new documentary called
in search of the most dangerous town on
the Internet presented by Norton
security which is the company that makes
trustworthy software for Internet
security I just watched the documentary
it's only about 15 minutes long and it's
actually really interesting it's about a
city in Romania that's been dubbed
hacker ville where a lot of the bigger
hackers come from and it kind of goes
through their stories why they became
hackers and what they think about the
future and security of the Internet but
for example that more than 80% of
servers and web sites are currently
vulnerable so if you're into technology
or if you use the Internet it's
definitely a documentary that I
recommend checking out that you can
actually watch right here on YouTube by
clicking on this annotation or on that
first link down below in the description
alright let's go ahead and get right
into it all right so right off the bat I
want to let you guys know that Hound is
still in beta so you can't really expect
it to go toe-to-toe with Google now or
Siri just yet but even at this early
stage it can do some pretty incredible
things with using just your voice that
the other two voice assistants can't so
that's where we're going to be focusing
on in this video so for example let's
say you're looking for a hotel with
Hound you can get really specific giving
it a bunch of parameters to go off of
okay hound show me hotels in Las Vegas
that are on the strip cost less than
$200 a night and have over a four star
rating on March 1st through March 5th
showing ten results with availability
with more than four stars near Las Vegas
Strip for Tuesday March 1st staying for
four nights for maximum of two hundred
US dollars per night if you want to
further refine your results you can use
hounds contextual capabilities by
following up with ok hound
don't show me hotels without free Wi-Fi
and
sorted by lois pryce okay
showing ten results sorted by lowest
price that provides free Wi-Fi as you
can see the results were further refined
and even sorted by lowest price without
us having to ask the initial question
all over again you can also ask how
multiple questions at the same time
instead of having to do these follow-ups
so okay hound what is the stock price
for Apple and Google and Microsoft and
what is the market cap for blackberry
the stock price is 120 for 64 cents us
for Apple 521 59 cents us for Google and
44 dollars and 42 cents us for Microsoft
the market cap of blackberry is 4.5 4
billion and you get all four answers at
once without having to go back and forth
individually and you can do the same
thing with foods so you could get the
total calories for a meal without having
to ask for each individual ingredient
and adding them all love and instead you
could ask for them all at once and let
hound do the math so ok hound how many
calories in 18 strawberries two bananas
one orange one mango and one cup of
vanilla ice cream
there are 827 calories and 18 medium raw
strawberries to medium raw bananas one
raw orange one raw mango and 1/4 ounce
cup of vanilla low carbohydrate regular
ice cream another example is what are
the best restaurants that are closest to
me that are cheap here are several
restaurants with more than three stars
sorted by rating then sorted by lowest
price and how filters the results by
first the best rated restaurants and
then sorts them by distance and priced
prioritized by the order in which I ask
for them how it also has a mortgage
calculator built in so ok hound what is
the monthly payment on a $300,000 house
with $60,000 down 5% interest and a
30-year term your monthly mortgage
payment is one
288 and again you can follow up with
what if I put down 10% okay
using a down payment of 10% your monthly
mortgage payment is one thousand four
hundred forty nine dollars and 42 cents
and you get your new answer so what a
cool question I wasn't able to get
either go now or Siri to answer was
exactly how many days old I am
so okay hound how many days has it been
since April 26th through 1989 there were
65 days 6 8 26 all right try that again
how many days since April 26 1989 there
were 9,000 561 days since April 26 1989
now that was a pretty simple question
but how can do way more complex ones
like when will the Sun set 12 days
before Christmas in Seattle
sunset in Seattle will be at 4:17 p.m.
on Sunday December 13th 2015 pretty cool
right but maybe even cooler is being
able to play a game with your voice
assistance so ok hound let's play
hangman hangman guess your first letter
for example you can say HRH is in house
hey there are no ways try again
e there are no E's try again oh my gosh
I sorry that's not the word try again ok
I said I I as in intelligent there are
no eyes ah oh there is one Oh finally L
there are no LM again are there are no
R's damage I think I got one more shot
yeah one more guess remaining i'ma go
with s not sure but s as in Sally
there is one us all right that's what I
thought P as in PI I didn't understand
what you said is a letter or word or say
quit no I'll never quit P as in PI
there is one p alright M as in Mary
there is one M whoa build the whole word
you will alright so on that is pretty
much it for me in this video on hound
obviously like I said before it's not at
the same level as Google now or C
reaches yet it's in beta maybe in a
couple of years or maybe if Google ends
up buying this we'll see it in Google
now that's kind of actually what I'm
hoping for but uh anyways that is pretty
much it for me in this video if you
liked it give it a big thumbs up to show
your love and as always I'll see you
guys in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
