and welcome back to another episode of
farm bluff q and A's the show where you
could ask me just about any question you
want related or unrelated to mobile
technology and where I get to ask you
guys that's right your opinion matters
here weekly questions via polls on our
facebook fan page you can be a part of
the polls by liking us at
facebook.com/foxnewslatino you like
touchwiz our play edition the short
answer is i like both but if i had to
choose one and only one i think i have
to go with the Play edition while
TouchWiz has a bunch of great features
that are really cool especially when
you're trying to show off to your
friends sometimes they can just kind of
given the way with stock Android and the
quick updates that come along with it
the high-end hardware on the galaxy s4
just really shines and it's just an
awesome experience for me being the
stock android fan that I am Calum asks
is the new Nexus 7 a failure or success
in your eyes and what would you change
considering that the first nexus 7 was a
huge success I can't really imagine it
being anything but I mean this summer on
google in these suits took that winning
formula from the original nexus 7 it
made it even better by addressing some
of the weaknesses that had on the first
gen like including at NDP screen
doubling the RAM giving it respectable
dual stereo speakers which were
desperately needed and all the while
keeping the price relatively low as far
as what I change out of anything I have
to say the processor now don't get me
wrong the Snapdragon s4 pro inside the
Nexus 7 is still a piece and handles
just about anything you throw at it
flawlessly but I feel like in a year or
two it might get a little dated
considering the fact that it's not
exactly cutting it right now being
almost a year old but with that said I'm
really liking the nexus 7 which I'll
tell you more about in the upcoming
review Hunter your hendrickson asks how
many phones do you have in your
collection that's a good question and I
couldn't really answer off the top of my
head so I pulled out all those boxes and
not counting any review units I have
just over 20 devices at this point hmm
should probably do a giveaway huh Rob
coalfield asks do you think the
possibility of an iphone 5c lower cost
solution was meant to compete with the
HTC One mini and s4 mini I say yes and
no if the iphone 5c rumors end up being
true the new phone would definitely
compete with likes of the One and Galaxy
s4 mini but I don't think Apple would be
doing it only to compete with those two
phones instead they'll be doing it to
grab a bigger share of that entry-level
to mid-level smartphone market
historically Apple just slashed the
prices of existing iphone models when a
new one came out and those kind of acted
as their entry and mid-level options the
iphone 5c would still be serving the
same purpose but with two major
advantages for one Apple will be able to
market an entirely new phone I mean we
never really saw an iPhone 4 or 4s
commercial after the iphone 5 came out
but I bet we'll be seeing a bunch of
iphone 5c commercials which definitely
should help them capture more of that
market and the second advantage is Apple
could potentially increase the profit
margin with the iphone 5c compared to
just slashing the prices of existing
models by using more cost effective
materials in the 5c compared to that on
the more premium materials that used in
smartphones at the iphone 5 or 4s of
course as of right now the iphone 5c or
whatever Apple might call their budget
iPhone is still a rumor and is nowhere
near official but I think what makes
sense for them to do it considering the
two advantages I just mentioned at the
same time though Apple's been doing it
the way they have been for so long now
that it'd be interesting to see if they
actually change their sales model I
asked you guys via phone buzz Facebook
poll which mobile OS do you think will
eventually win the battle for third
place after Android and iOS and it seems
like most of you think it'll be windows
phone with seventy-six percent of the
vote coming in at second place and a
little bit of a surprise was a boon to
with eighteen percent of the vote and in
third or in Las depending on how you
want to look at it only five percent of
you think that blackberry will
eventually capture that up for grabs
spot behind Android and iOS as far as
the results go I totally agree with you
guys and think that Windows Phone will
be able to keep that spot as the third
place of West lockdown I mean what the
company is big as Microsoft backing it
and with great handset many
just like Samsung HTC and especially
Nokia really embracing Windows Phone I
don't really see any other OS even
coming close in fact i think the things
that are really holding Windows Phone
back right now our lack of apps compared
to android and iOS and the lack of ultra
high-end smartphones with 1080p screens
quad-core processors and all that stuff
once windows phone gets those two things
I think it'll still be in third place
but it will have much larger share of
the pie at least a alright guys
