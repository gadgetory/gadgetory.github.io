bought calm and in this video I'm doing
a review slash how to on the smart state
X app available from Google Play for
free that basically is the same thing as
a smart stay app that you see on
TouchWiz on the galaxy s3 which uses the
front-facing camera to detect whether or
not your face is looking at the phone
and be able to decide whether or not to
turn the screen off or keep it on past
the regular system screen timeout as a
result so anyway let's see if it
actually works it's a great feature you
know in theory I will go ahead and see
if it works the way you do it is you
first turn it on obviously when you open
the app let's go ahead and check start
on boot but you won't necessarily need
to do that you can choose between a few
options over here you can choose how
many scan lives it has it defaults to
two so I'll go ahead and leave it at
that and if you tap on smart timeout
you could actually go to the
accessibility settings I believe it's
only for phones with Ice Cream Sandwich
and later basically just tap on this guy
and turn it on so that way it takes the
user actions to delay scanning when it's
not required basically meaning if you
touch the screen it won't actually scan
because that will ultimately waste more
battery life you know you don't there's
no need for the phone to scan for your
face if you're touching the screen so
anyway I turned that guy on you could
also detect the scan time out I'll just
leave it as default at 3 seconds so
anyways go ahead and see how it works
I'm going to press home and show you
guys these steps so I'm gonna go ahead
and face it you know toward my face and
see what happens actually first I gotta
go into my system timeout so I'm going
to display the sleep timeout I'm gonna
set its 15 seconds so that way we can
see if it's working out so I'm gonna
face it towards me and see if it
actually that's my face and I'm just
gonna have to wait so he says scanning
face detected and the screen staying on
let's try to go for another cycle or so
to make sure that the screen doesn't
actually turn off so scanning face
detected and it's working so obviously
you know we went past the 15-second mark
here and we'll wait one more time just
to be sure and yeah seems like it works
pretty well of course I'm on the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus you know your results are
your you know experience may be
different depending
your phone now it's not scanning my face
obviously is facing the camcorder so I
doubt that you know it will work and
hopefully it doesn't work so that way it
actually turns the screen off and looks
like it did so so far so good I mean the
app seems like it works for me obviously
like I said I have the Samsung Galaxy
Nexus definitely a feature that I really
like I mean I think this is one of the
coolest features that was on TouchWiz
and to be able to download an app and
actually have it on your phone whether
you have TouchWiz or not you know use it
on maybe the HTC One X HTC One S using
on the Galaxy Nexus and even tablets
like the Nexus 7 it's really cool to
have it definitely you know something
good I'm gonna go ahead and see if I can
put it on my face now so it doesn't work
as good I would say as a smart stay on
the TouchWiz because you know touch was
like you could be it could be just
sitting here and all sudden you could
turn it to your face and it'll detect it
where this one's kind of gotta be
looking at you beforehand and then it'll
detect your face it's go ahead and
scanning see face detected so um I mean
honestly for a free app and you know for
one that isn't a cert I mean it's still
a work in progress I definitely give it
a thumbs up I'm just wanted to make a
quick video about it some of you guys
requested it so that is that if you
found this video helpful please hit the
like button and subscribe I'll put the
link to the application in the
description box below if you want to
download as well alright so from in this
video thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
