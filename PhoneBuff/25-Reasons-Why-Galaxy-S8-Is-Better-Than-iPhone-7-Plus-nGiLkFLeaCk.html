S8 and the iPhone 7 Plus are two of the best
smartphones in the world right now, but each
of them bring their own unique advantages
to the table.
So in this two part video series, we’re
going to be comparing them #phonebuffstyle,
looking at a bunch of reasons why the Galaxy
S8 could be considered better than the iPhone
7 in this video, and why the iPhone 7 could
be considered better than the Galaxy S8 in
the next video - which I’ll be linking for
you down below.
But before we get into the reasons, I want
give a shout out to VideoBlocks for sponsoring
today’s episode.

So check them out, create something special,
and share it with #creator2creator.
Alright, let’s get to the reasons.
Reason #1: Infinity Display - Put the Galaxy
S8+ next to the iPhone 7 Plus, and they’re
roughly the same size.
But turn their screen’s on, and it’s a
completely different story.
Samsung managed to squeeze in a huge 6.2 in
screen in roughly the same footprint that
Apple only managed to fit a 5.5 in screen
in.
Giving you all of the perks of having a bigger
display, without a phone that’s any harder
to hold in the hand.
2.
Futuristic Design - With the display’s new
taller aspect ratio, the curved edges on both
the front and the back, and the overall glass
and metal body, the Galaxy S8 just looks like
it's a phone from the future.
Which in comparison, kind of makes the iPhone
7 remind you of those old school TVs of the
past.
3.
Virtual Reality - Speaking of the future,
thanks to its higher resolution display along
with a partnership with Oculus, the Galaxy
S8 and Samsung’s Gear VR offer a great virtual
reality experience that you just can’t get
on the iPhone.
4.
Fast Charging - With Adaptive Fast Charging,
the Galaxy S8 charges a lot faster than the
iPhone 7 does.
Just 30 minutes of charge time can add over
40% to your battery.
Compare that to the 20% you get with the iPhone,
and the S8 is way more convenient to have
in situations like when you forget to charge
your phone overnight.
Reason #5: Wireless charging - In addition
to Fast Charging, the Galaxy S8 also supports
wireless charging, letting you charge the
phone by simply setting it down on a charging
pad.
Eliminating the need to ever have to plug
it in ever again.
6.
Headphone Jack - If you have a car that doesn’t
support Bluetooth Audio, the headphone jack
is probably going to be an important feature
to you.
But even if your car does have bluetooth,
and your headphones are wireless, having a
headphone jack is still a nice thing to have.
The headphone jack makes it easy to quickly
play DJ in a friend's car without having to
set up bluetooth first, and there are a lot
of accessories out there that still rely on
it to function.
7.
MicroSD Slot - On the iPhone 7, the amount
of storage that comes with your phone is all
the storage you will ever have.
Which might not be an issue for you if you
buy the highest storage and most expensive
model, but if you don’t want to spend all
that cash up front for something you might
never need, the Galaxy S8 has the option to
expand your memory by up to 256GB with a relatively
cheap microSD card.
8.
USB Type C - The Galaxy S8 uses a USB Type
C port, which is the new industry standard
popping up on more and more devices, including
Apple’s own Macbooks.
And there’s a good reason for it.
USB Type C offers faster data speeds, delivers
more power, and in general seems to be a bit
more durable than the thinner lightning cables
for the iPhone.
And bonus, Samsung includes a USB Type A adapter
in the box, which allows you to easily connect
things like a flash drive.
9.
Iris Scanner - Samsung claims that the Iris
Scanner is up to 100x more secure than the
fingerprint scanner, which is great and may
be important to you if you’re a secret agent
or something.
But I think the real value of the Iris Scanner
for most people at least, lies in it being
a convenient backup option for the situations
when your hands are wet or when you're wearing
gloves.
Reason #10: Quick Camera Launch - From any
screen, on or off, you can jump right into
the Galaxy S8’s camera with a double tap
of the power button.
This not only makes it less likely that you’ll
miss a great photo because you were fumbling
around looking for the camera icon, but it
also kind of encourages you to take more photos,
at least it does for me.
11.
Camera Features - The Galaxy S8’s camera
comes packed with a bunch of features that
you won’t find on the iPhone’s camera.
Bixby Vision detects what you’re looking
at and gives you relevant information, dual
camera simultaneously takes photos and videos
from the front and rear cameras, and face
filters can remove blemishes and even slim
down your face.
12.
Customization - On the Galaxy S8, you’re
not stuck the same old look everybody else
has.
You can truly make the phone more of your
own with hundreds of custom themes and icons,
that can change the way the phone looks system-wide.
13.
Ultra Power Saver Mode - If you ever find
yourself in a position where your phone’s
dying on you and you know that you won’t
have access to a charger for a while, the
Galaxy S8’s Ultra Power Saver mode can extend
your battery life from having just minutes
of battery life left to potentially having
several hours, by effectively turning your
smartphone into a dumbphone.
14.
Samsung Pay - So Apple Pay and Samsung Pay
do roughly the same thing, they both let you
pay for things using your phone.
But the difference is, Apple Pay is accepted
at about 5 million retail locations, which
sounds like a lot..
Until you consider that Samsung Pay is accepted
at over 30 million!
The reason for the difference is the Galaxy
S8 has technology that can mimic the magnetic
strip on your credit card.
So generally speaking if you can physically
swipe your credit card somewhere, then you
can probably pay using the Galaxy S8 - even
when the cashier doesn’t think it's possible.
Reason #15: Edge Panel - With the Edge Panel,
you can take advantage of the curved screen
on the S8 with panels of your favorite apps
and shortcuts, so that way you can conveniently
access them from anywhere with just a swipe,
regardless of which app you’re in.
16.
Split Screen Multitasking - The tall screen
on the S8 and S8+ make them ideal for split
screen multitasking.
But my personal favorite multitasking feature
on the S8 is Pin To Top, where you can pin
any part of the the screen to the corner,
and then jump into other apps, with the information
you pinned staying in the corner until you
no longer want it there.
17.
Separate App Audio - The Galaxy S8 has the
option to play audio from an app like your
music app separate from all of your other
apps.
So for example, if you’re listening to music
on a bluetooth speaker, and you want to check
a snapchat really quick, the snapchat audio
won’t interfere with the music playing on
the speaker and instead will just play on
the phone itself.
18.
Smart Select - On the Galaxy S8, you can take
a selective screenshot of exactly what you
want on your screen without the hassle of
having to crop anything out after the fact.
You can extract text from screenshots, letting
you copy and paste things you normally couldn’t,
and scroll capture lets you take extended
screenshots that automatically scroll the
screen down - perfect for when you want to
screenshot an entire article or when you want
to share a text conversation with a friend.
19.
Smart Stay - You know when you’re reading
something or you’re watching a video on
Instagram and you keep having to touch the
screen every few seconds to make sure that
it doesn’t turn off?
Yeah, you don’t have to do that on the Galaxy
S8.
The phone knows when you’re looking at the
screen, and will keep the screen on for as
long as you’re looking it.
Reason #20: Notification Cues - On the Galaxy
S8, you know about your notifications before
you even turn the screen on.
A feature called Smart Alert vibrates the
phone when you pick it up and have a missed
message, while the physical LED light flashes
app specific colors, like yellow for Snapchat
or blue for Facebook, letting you decide if
you even want to check your phone to begin
with.
21.
No Camera Hump - Unlike the iPhone 7 Plus,
the Galaxy S8’s camera lens doesn’t protrude.
Meaning you can use it while it’s lying
flat on your desk without it constantly rocking
back and forth like the iPhone does.
22.
Create A GIF - Whether you’re watching your
own video or a video on social media, you
can turn it into a A GIF easily by selecting
exactly what you want on your screen to be
in the GIF and then just hit record - the
phone takes care of the rest and automatically
gives you a GIF that you can share with your
friends.
23.
Secure folder - Secure Folder uses defense
grade technology to help you keep your more
sensitive data, whether it’s a photo, an
e-mail account or an app, private and completely
separate from the rest of your phone.
So for example, you can install app like Twitter
in Secure Folder, log into an account, and
that twitter app will be completely different
and separate from the Twitter app you normally
use outside of Secure Folder.
This is great for when you want to keep your
work stuff separate from personal stuff, or
for things you just want an extra layer of
protection for - like an app for your bank.
24.
Scheduled Messages - With the S8 you can schedule
your text messages to be sent at any time
in the future.
For example, you can schedule a text message
saying “Happy Birthday” to a friend several
weeks before their birthday, and have that
message sent to them automatically on the
day of.
Or you can schedule a text to your kid on
Trash Day reminding them to take out the garbage.
It’s a great way to automate the messages
you’re going to send anyway.
And finally, reason #25: Clipboard - Going
beyond just your basic copy and paste, the
Galaxy S8 lets you copy up to 20 pieces of
text or photos to the clipboard, and lets
paste them in any order you want later on.
Alright, so now that you've seen why the Galaxy
S8 could be better than than the iPhone 7,
click over here to see why the iPhone 7 could
be considered better than the Galaxy S8.
Don't be closed minded, watch both videos.
After you do be sure to vote for which phone
you thought had the stronger reasons.
But outside of that, that is it for me in
this video.
Thank you guys for watching, and as always,
I'll see you in the very next episode!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
