gonna show you a little-known trick to
closing all the apps on your iPhone at
the same time now those of you who have
Android or have had Android in the past
you know that a lot of Android phones
have an option to to simply press a
button and it closes all of your apps
instead of having to do it one by one
well no such option actually exists on
the iPhone and that's the reason for
today's video so prior to the trick you
only have two options one is you can
swipe away apps one by one like that
which depending on how many apps you
have opened up it can take a really long
time and the second option is of course
to restart the phone so you power it off
power back on and technically those
actually cleared out of RAM which again
is time consuming now I don't often
close my apps on my iPhone because
usually iOS does a really good job at
handling them and actually makes the
phone go faster so for example I have to
skate here open clicking on it you can
see it opened up right away now if I was
to close that app right there and then
reopen it again you can see it takes
longer so why would you want to slow
your phone down the second thing is also
this affects battery life as the
processor has to reload the app and
because it has to reload the app it uses
battery to do that so you're actually
wasting battery life as well I honestly
wouldn't close my apps if you don't have
to but there are certain situations
where it makes sense without any further
ado let's figure out how to actually do
it so it's actually really simple all
you have to do is press and hold on the
power button here and you wait until you
get the little slide to power off screen
now you don't actually touch the screen
you actually just press and hold on the
home button so I'll go ahead and do that
and hold it for a few seconds until the
phone takes you back to the home screen
and there you go alright so just to show
you that it work I'll go ahead and have
all these games opened up in the
background so I have smash it open I
have to skate open
I've got Angry Birds open as you can see
and I have got asphalt date open so I'll
go ahead and do the trick again press
and hold on the power button press and
hold on the home button and then just
wait and voila
so now I'll go ahead and jump back into
asphalt 8 as you can see the app is
reloading same thing goes for true scape
again has to reload the app now one
thing I do have to warn you about is it
does show up and the recent Apple is so
when you do the trick to close all the
apps it's still gonna show up here if
you have OCD it's not necessarily going
to take care of that problem it acts
more or less like a restart when you
restart your phone the apps still
technically show up even though they've
been cleared out of RAM parts I have
another tip for you guys you guys
probably already know this one but just
in case you don't if you do have OCD and
for whatever reason you want to close
all the apps and get them out of the
recent app list you can do so a lot
quicker than one doing it one by one
with three fingers so what I like to do
is I line up three apps on the screen
like this so I could have three of my
fingers fit on screen and then I just
swipe up so am i doing it nope there you
go
so it's not the easiest thing to do but
once you do it you'd actually close your
apps a lot faster so that is pretty much
it's for me in this video that's how you
close all of your apps with just one
step and a little bonus tip for you guys
you can swipe away apps three at a time
instead of just one but uh if you liked
this video give it a big thumbs up to
show your support
subscribe for more tech videos just like
this and as always I'll see you in the
very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
