bomb.com and in this video we're doing a
speed comparison test between iOS and
Android flagship tablets on the left you
have the Asus Nexus 7 tablet from Google
and on the right of course you have the
iPad 2 the third-generation in this case
so let's go ahead and start our speed
comparison test we're gonna do the boot
up test first so find the power button
so I'll press with the same time so 1 2
3 hold them for about 3 seconds each and
there you go set these guys down and I
want to load and let you know they're
both on the same Wi-Fi network and
browsing history has been wiped on both
browsers today I'll be doing a browser
test I'm also be doing app speed
comparison test but kind of hard to do
are kind of hard to find apps that are
similar because not only are they
different OSS but they're also you know
that the ipad apps are different we're
on the nexus 7
the app store it's basically the same
thing as you'd get on the phone so over
here you can see the ipad has finished
what like maybe 5 seconds before the
nexus 7 tablet did so obviously the boot
up test win goes to the ipad keep in
mind that the nexus 7 tablet is a $200
tablet the ipad over here the third
generation is a $500 tablet this guy has
a Nvidia quad-core processor at one
point three gigahertz with a 12 core GPU
and this guy has a dual core a5 x1
gigger processor or a dual core
processor with a quad-core GPU so keep
that in mind now I'm not gonna be
comparing the devices here I'm just
gonna be doing strictly speed so I'm not
you know considering the price I'm not
considering the resolution etc I just
want to see you know what device is
gonna give you the fastest experience so
with that said let's go ahead and start
our application speed test first
application on my run is Temple Run so
I'll go ahead and do that so one two
three
and we'll see which one actually loads
the game up first so the iPad actually
loaded it up first followed by androids
Nexus 7 we'll go ahead and close out now
I'm actually gonna close out the
applications here because I am you know
testing different os's and
you know the iPad won't actually
multitask where the next seven will it's
not gonna be fair if I don't do it so
anyway
let's go to the next app which will be
maps so one two three and again open up
faster on the iPad again I'll this swipe
this guy off which typically closes not
always but should do the job here we'll
go to Google Earth so one two three so
doing to Google Apps back-to-back this
time the Nexus 7 actually opened Google
Earth up first
so finally you know wins one of its home
court advantage apps close this guy out
here will swipe it out here and lastly
we'll open up Flixter now Flixster
they're both the tablet versions which
is nice so we'll go ahead and open up
one two three and that one was really
close I mean I couldn't really tell I
know that the left side loaded up first
on the Nexus 7 tablet and octenol
external force on the iPad but the
content seemed to load up first on the
Nexus 7 so I'll call it a tie but maybe
if I give it a win I'd say the Nexus 7
not really sure you guys can be the
judge of that one let's go ahead and
close this out but now let's get to a
test that really matters I mean to boot
up and the app speed test the apps are
different differently written so it's
not that big of a deal but the browsing
test is worse really gonna make a
difference because you know the Internet
you connect to it all the same so let's
go ahead and go to a few websites first
website we'll go to of course is
phonebook calm alright so I went ahead
and typed in phone whoof common both
imma hit go at the same time so one two
three and let's see which one actually
loads up first
so it looks like the iPad is actually
done now and this guy's still loading
and you know you could kind of tell from
the beginning that the iPad had a bit of
a head start on the rendering of the web
page compared to the next seven let's go
ahead and open up this application right
over here or this web page right here so
I'm going to tap at the same time and
we're seeing the content much faster
here got the pictures got the ads now
this guy's done so again the win goes to
the iPad alright so let's go ahead and
load up another web set we'll go ahead
and go to Engadget so one two three
again we're seeing the content first on
the iPad now just to note I did turn off
the pre loading you know rendering on
the Google Chrome browser because it
does load up you know things before
actually hit enter so the iPad is done
yeah loads up things before I hit enter
if I leave that optional I turned it off
to make it fair and again you know we
got the win for the iPad now let's just
do a scrolling test so I'm just gonna
scroll to the bottom you guys can see
you know no little check boards
everything is super super smooth and you
know zooming in and out is really really
nice so let's go ahead and try the same
thing on the next seven go over now you
can see see like it just went all white
so it wasn't necessarily look rendering
the whole webpage the way you know you'd
expect it to you know even when I go
back up you ready loaded that part in
it's always now it seems like it's doing
okay and let's go ahead and do the
pinch-to-zoom test and the print resume
is super super smooth so basically the
main difference is you know the browser
actually loads up faster on the iPad but
also you know when you scroll down
you're gonna get you know white you know
white page basically on the nexus 7
where you're not gonna get that iPad so
you're gonna get more of a desktop
experience on the iPad so anyway that's
the short you know speed comparison test
obviously the iPad 1 in pretty much
every category the only you know when
that really went to the next seven was
Google Earth and it's not that big of a
deal obviously you're paying $200 here
paying 500 hours over here so you know
keep that in mind
you know is that speed difference worth
$300 to you or maybe some other things
like the higher resolution screen but
whatever it is just wanted to do this
video for you guys to use could actually
know what the difference is if you found
