i'm finally back with another video and
in this video we're gonna be unboxing
the samsung galaxy camera which is at
least a product worth looking at and
2013 for two reasons number one it's
unlike anything we really used to seeing
and number two it just maybe what the
future digital cameras will look like so
what Samsung did with the Galaxy camera
is kind of same thing to deal with the
Galaxy Note in the sense that with a
note they took a tablet a smartphone put
the two together to make the Galaxy Note
or in this case note to same idea with
the Galaxy camera but instead of a
tablet they took a smartphone thank God
and a digital camera put the two
together and out came the Galaxy camera
now this is really similar to the galaxy
s3 because if you look at the spec sheet
they're pretty much the same I mean the
same Exynos four quad processor a gig of
ram a 4.8 inch display and of course is
running Android 4.1 jelly bean with
Samsung's TouchWiz UI but the major
difference obviously is the fact that
this is a dedicated camera or it's meant
to be used as a camera first instead of
a smartphone and that means it has a 16
megapixel sensor which is definitely a
blow the galaxy s3s camera or any camera
on a smartphone for that matter out of
the water and it has 21 X optical zoom
which means that you'll be able to zoom
in and zoom out without losing image
quality like you would on a smartphone
because smartphones don't have optical
zoom they have digital zoom which pretty
much just enlarges the photo where over
here you actually zoom in with the lens
and taking the same quality photo as you
would if you're zoomed out so anyways
let's go ahead and find out what's
inside the box
so we'll start off by looking at the box
itself first on the front there's a
picture of the camera some samsung
branding in the corner and at the bottom
there it tells you that the camera has a
16 megapixel sensor 21 X optical zoom
and has a 23 millimeter wide zoom lens
at the top of the box it just says smart
camera and lists the Samsung website at
the bottom you have your serial numbers
the left and right of the box are
completely blank and on the back you'll
find the specifications for the camera
which in this case is 18 T's version
which includes
HSPA+ of course it has that 1.4
gigahertz xml's 4 quad like on the s3 a
4.8 inch display which is what samsung
is calling an HD Super Clear LCD so a
little bit different from what you see
on the s3 which is Super AMOLED
and finally what really says this camera
apart is the fact that it's running
Android 4.1 jelly bean okay so we'll go
ahead and open up the box by taking out
our trusty razor and cutting the two
pieces of clear tape on each side so
we'll go ahead and pop off the top cover
and set it off to the side spin this guy
around and there she is so you can see
we got the white version here I know
that they have the black version as well
go ahead and pull it out of the box and
you see the plastic covering on the
screen reminding us that it's running
Android and it's got a quad core which
is just awesome when you think about it
take a quick look at the device before
setting it off to the side and now let's
check out what's inside the box so first
thing you see is the 18 T SIM card which
is already in the camera we've got a
Quick Start Guide and Terms &amp;amp; Conditions
which is available in both English and
Spanish course for the US version
nothing too exciting there so digging
further into the box we find a white
lanyard which you can connect to the
camera in case you're clumsy prevent
yourself from dropping around accident
of course we have a USB wall adapter and
with the wall adapter comes a USB to
micro USB cable which you can use to
charge it or to connect the cameras to
your computer and the last thing in the
Box is the battery which is sixteen
hundred and fifteen million so not the
same one on the galaxy s3 unfortunately
so you can't interchange them alright
that's pretty much it for the box so
let's take a look at the device itself
on the front you have a 16 megapixel
sensor with 23 millimeter wide zoom ones
capable of 21 X optical zoom on the back
you have nothing but the 4.8 inch HD is
Super Clear LCD which really gives the
camera a nice sleek look similar to what
you'd see on a Nexus device on the left
side you have a button to pop open the
flash and just below that you have your
speaker grille on the right you have a
slot for the lanyard that we saw earlier
in the box your micro USB charging port
and the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack at
the top on the bottom you have your
model numbers tripod head slot micro
HDMI port and a cover that opens up to
your battery micro sim and microSD card
slots and finally on the top you have
the flash that pops open that we
mentioned earlier a power slash standby
button and of course the shutter button
with the ring around it that lets you
zoom in and out when you first turn the
camera on you see this boot up animation
which is a little bit different from
what you'd see on the galaxy
smartphones and tablets after the boot
up animation you're taken to the setup
screen which is surprisingly only two
screens you have to go through before
you can access the camera which is much
appreciated when you do finally get to
the home screen you'll notice that it
looks very similar to the galaxy s3s
of course big difference here is that
the camera shortcut shows up on all your
home screens app launcher for the most
part looks the same just as everything
else does the biggest difference here is
the camera app itself this isn't the
camera app from the galaxy s3 or any
other Android phone for that matter you
get a whole bunch of shooting modes that
you can choose from and for example I'll
go ahead and choose best face and it'll
shoot in that mode being optimized for
whatever you want it to do if you don't
like those you go to expert mode and
customize it yourself you could change
your shutter speed you can change your
exposure values and you can change your
is those which is really nice because
you ultimately get complete control over
how your photo looks and when you're
spending this much money on a camera you
wouldn't really expect anything less so
I'm glad that Samsung included it okay
before we wrap up this video there are a
couple of things I want to show you guys
one is that you control the volume from
the zoom in and zoom out toggle over
here which is nice because there isn't a
dedicated volume rocker the other is the
way that the flash pops out when you
press this button you can see this pops
I like that you push it right back in
and it makes a pretty satisfying sound
as well which is nice for me at least at
the bottom you have the battery cover
which will go ahead and open up and show
you you know the battery the micro sim
and microSD card slot which you can
easily access as well as the micro HDMI
port if you wanted to connect it to a TV
but that's pretty much it for me in this
video if you found it helpful please
give it a thumbs up and subscribe to the
channel if you haven't already thank you
