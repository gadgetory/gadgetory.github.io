have a very special speed test that
involves a little bit of sibling rivalry
between these Snapdragon and Exynos
variants of the galaxy s7 but before we
get to racing I want to give a quick
shout out to Norton the go-to source for
internet security software who recently
released part two of their documentary
series the most dangerous town on the
Internet this latest episode covers what
are called cyber bunkers where
organizations can safely host and store
their sensitive data like many
documentaries of this type there are
plenty of heated moments for example
when the journalist gets cussed out by a
company that doesn't want to be
videotaped don't take any pictures of me
doesn't make me angry stay away from me
okay so not your friend it's actually a
pretty intense documentary so if you're
interested in cyber security you own a
phone or you use the Internet this may
be a documentary worth checking out
which will be linked for you down below
in the description all right let's get
to the speed test so you guys know the
drill we'll get this thing going by
starting these stopwatches on each phone
and then jump into the first row of
system apps on your left you have the
quad-core Snapdragon 820 s7 and on your
right you have the octa core Exynos
88-90 s7 which has quickly pulled ahead
in this first lap with it already
finishing up with Angry Birds and
starting to work on asphalt 8 but when I
even halfway through this first lap so
there is still plenty of time for both
variants to show off what they can do
and really it's this first lap that I'm
most interested in seeing as a phone's
processor can make a significant
difference during the initial loading of
an application so we're really getting
to see which processor is faster with
this type of usage and so far it looks
like the Exynos is edging out the
snapdragon with it being almost a full
lap ahead finishing up Photoshop mix and
heading into lab set where each one will
create a time-lapse from the same exact
video file so this could be where the
Snapdragon 820 makes up some ground on
the Exynos now at this point it is worth
noting that while the phones are almost
identical outside of their processors
from a hardware perspective there are
also some differences in software as the
Snapdragon variant being tested here is
from AT&amp;amp;T which has a bad habit of
putting bloatware on their phones
however we did disable all the
after we were able to beforehand so in
theory the software should make too much
of a difference
after finishing up Spotify the Exynos
variant of the s7 moves on to the last
leg of this first lap loading up both
the mobile and the desktop versions of
the Amazon website and there you go it
finishes the first stop at a time of 1
minute and 27 seconds which is almost a
good 10 seconds faster than the
Snapdragon variants time of 1 minute and
36 seconds and the Exynos version looks
to keep asleep with it actually keeping
at least most of these games open up in
the background which the Snapdragon
variant does not so an unexpected turn
of events with the Exodus version just
breezing through this second lap while
the Snapdragon variant is having these
same old issues we've seen other Samsung
phones have in the past struggling to
keep all the apps open in the background
despite having the same amount of
physical RAM so the xml's variant
finishes the race with a total time of 2
minutes and 3 seconds while the
Snapdragon variant is still stuck on the
gaming row so we'll go ahead and
fast-forward it to the finish line where
nearly 40 seconds later it logs a total
time of 2 minutes and 41 seconds ok so
very interesting results the excellent
did better than the Snapdragon variant
in that first lap which is kind of
something I expected but what surprised
me was that the Exynos variant also did
better in the multitasking lap which I
didn't expect since both phones have the
same amount of RAM and supposedly run on
the same software but either way the
Exynos variant is definitely the faster
of the two so it'll be interesting to
see how it does against the iPhone 6s
plus and other phones on the line so
enable those channel notifications so
you don't miss out on any of our
upcoming speed tests alright guys that
is it for me in this video thank you for
watching and as always I'll see you in
the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
