this video i'm gonna show you how to do
a hard reset a factory reset or a master
reset whatever you want to call it on
your Windows Phone 7 so the way you're
going to do it is go over to your app
list and go down to settings and tap on
settings from here you can go down to
the bottom where it says about tap on
that guy and then again go to the bottom
and hit where it says we set your phone
you're going to tap it and you can get
the warning at the very top saying
resetting your phone will erase all your
personal content including the apps
you've purchased are downloaded and will
restore all the factory settings
basically it'll become like a new phone
again all your information we wipe so
yes once you're sure you want to do that
it dealt with checks with you guys how
serious it is anyway yes again and you
can see this as restarting let the phone
do this thing when it restarts I might
take a little bit to actually turn on
but just let it let it do its thing
don't actually pull the battery out or
anything like that and once the power is
on you will have a fresh new phone with
no content and hopefully if you're
having issues no problems either all
right I said for me in this video this
