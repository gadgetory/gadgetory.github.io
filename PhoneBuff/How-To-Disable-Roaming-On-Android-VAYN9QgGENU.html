Famicom and in this video I'm going to
show you guys how to make sure that your
phone doesn't go on roaming mode or how
to turn on roaming or how to turn it off
so basically what you're going to do is
go over to your settings icon so you can
press menu in settings or just go to the
settings icon within your app list and
go scroll down to this wireless and
networks part of your phone so now you
can see how much it looks like this
might look a little bit different if
you're on a pre Ice Cream Sandwich
device but just going to hit more and
what you're going to be looking for is a
part of your phone that says mobile
networks right here so I'm just going to
tap on it and you can see now it says
data roaming mine's checked it's going
to uncheck it so that way the phone
doesn't automatically roam if I'm in a
weak reception spot or from traveling
and I don't have you know reception
along that area so anyway make sure
that's unchecked if you don't want to
incur roaming charges if you do or if
you plan covers it let's go ahead and
check that guy and hit ok so that way
you have reception everywhere you go
alright that's pretty much it for me in
this video this is Dave informal comm
thanks for watching it and don't forget
to visit former comm for more cellphone
news reviews and how to's thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
