stuff week here on YouTube
today is Tuesday reviews day and we're
gonna be reviewing probably the most
under hyped and overlooked product that
Apple announced last month in the iPad
Mini for now this video is being
sponsored by YouTube for awesome stuff
week where they're rolling out a new
feature called shoppable where you can
shop for a product that you see in a
video straight from the video including
this one just by clicking on that little
icon at the top right of your screen
it's actually pretty cool so check it
out if you have a chance but with that
said let's go ahead and get right into
it alright so first things first the
iPad Mini 4 is not a blown-up version of
the iPhone 6s in fact from a tech spec
standpoint it has very little in common
with the success as it doesn't have 3d
touch it doesn't have the new 12
megapixel camera and it doesn't run on
the a9 chip but on an iPad and
especially an iPad Mini this isn't
really that big of a deal at least for
now while the iPad Mini 4 looks almost
identical to the iPad Mini 3 the Mini 4
is actually a significant upgrade over
its predecessor which is something you
couldn't really say about the somewhat
forgettable and now discontinued iPad
Mini 3 really Apple should have called
the iPad Mini 4 the iPad Mini air as
it's both the lightest and the thinnest
iPad available right now measuring image
is 6.1 millimeters thick and weighing
only 298 grams which on a tablet is
incredibly light and makes using it for
those long video or gaming sessions much
more comfortable than any other tablet
on the market right now the display has
these same 2048 by 1536 resolution as
its predecessors but this new screen is
actually a lot better than the spec
sheet would indicate it now has a fully
laminated display which basically
eliminates the gap between the screen
and the cover glass giving you up to 44%
more color saturation it also has an
anti reflective coating which reduces
glare by up to 56% making it a lot
easier to see when using it under direct
light under the hood the iPad Mini 4 is
powered by the same Apple a8 chip that
we saw in the iPhone 6 but it is now
coupled with not one but two gigabytes
of RAM which allows you to take full
advantage of
new multitasking abilities like split
view where you can run two apps on the
screen at the same time and
picture-in-picture which lets you shrink
a video down to the corner of the screen
while you work on something else I've
been using the device for a couple of
weeks now doing a lot of multitasking
and gaming in between and so far I
haven't really noticed any hiccups or
slowdowns with the a eight so
performance is definitely not something
you'll have to worry about and luckily
neither is battery life as the iPad Mini
4 is ready to last for up to 10 hours of
web surfing and video and in my
experience it actually seems to last
even longer than that with me being able
to go pretty much three or four days
without needing a charge now for those
of you who are into taking pictures with
the tablet you'll be happy to know that
Apple upgraded the 5 megapixel camera up
to an 8 megapixel shooter that can also
do 120 FPS slow motion video and while I
can't say that I spent a whole lot of
time using the camera mainly because I
didn't want to be shunned from society
the few photos I did take for the
purpose of this review look pretty good
actually
especially when in well-lit conditions
unfortunately the 1.2 megapixel
front-facing camera wasn't bumped up to
5 megapixels like on the new iPhones
which is too bad since video calling on
an iPad offers a much better experience
than video calling on an iPhone thanks
to the larger screen so I would have
much rather seen Apple upgrade the
front-facing camera instead of the rear
camera but thankfully despite its
relatively low megapixel count the front
camera is still good enough to get the
job done the bottom facing stereo
speakers on the iPad offers surprisingly
good sound considering these size
limitations however I do wish Apple
would have adopted either front-facing
speakers like we've seen on several
other tablets or a four speakers setup
like on the new iPad pro as I did manage
to accidentally cover up the speaker's
quite a bit while I was watching video
and gaming which kind of took away from
the otherwise immersive experience and
up I guess the only other real complaint
I have about the new iPad Mini is the
lack of the physical mute / rotation
switch that the iPad Mini 3 and almost
every other iPad before it had which was
just a way more convenient way of
locking rotation compared to having to
go through control center the iPad Mini
4 replaces the iPad Mini 3 from the mini
lineup and comes in at the same price
points of 399 for the 16 gigabyte model
499 for the 60
for gigabyte model and $5.99 for the 128
gigabyte model if you want a Wi-Fi and
cellular model like I have here it'll
set you back an additional 130 bucks at
each storage tier now which model you
get completely depends on how you plan
to use it as you'll probably are
hopefully not take as many pictures as
you do on your phone but at the same
time you'll probably want to consume a
lot more media so personally I went with
64 gigabytes as I do like gaming on that
bigger screen but if you don't plan on
gaming and taking pictures and you plan
on using it mostly for streaming things
like Netflix or watching YouTube then
you just might be able to get by with 16
gigabytes but if you can afford it I
would recommend biting the bullet and
just going with 64 gigabytes so you
don't regret it later so I guess the
main question is is the iPad Mini 4
worth the upgrade and again it depends
if you already have the iPad Mini 3 then
I would say probably not but otherwise I
think the better display the addition of
the touch ID fingerprint scanner the
thinner and lighter design and probably
most importantly the ability to do
split-screen multitasking which you can
only do on the newer iPads by the way
makes the iPad Mini 4 the best small
tablet that money can currently buy
