and this video I want to show you how
the Galaxy Nexus and Ice Cream Sandwich
let's see you connect your USB devices
to your Android phone or tablet so
obviously the gun X doesn't have a USB
port you just have your micro USB
charging port right here so what you can
get is this adapter it's called the OTG
USB to micro USB adapter I got it off
Amazon it's about five dollars or so and
as you can see it has the USB port and
the micro USB side so I'm just gonna
plug this guy into my phone and connect
a couple of point devices so I'll
connect a mouse and a keyboard so first
up I'll connect my hardwired mouse so
you can see here's my mouse and here is
the other end of the USB so I'll go
ahead and plug it in really quick and
show you how this works so plug it in
and start to use it so it's kind of hard
to see right now on the screen that it's
on now let's go ahead and go over to the
settings and it might be a little bit
easier to see on camera the little
cursor so I don't know if you can see
that but I am controlling my phone from
my mouse and that was cool that could
actually edit or modify some of the
settings for the mouse for example I
could go to a pointer speed right here
and make it faster or slower depending
on how I like it
hit okay and you can see I'm using the
mouse just like I normally would you
know you just click on the button you
want are the thing you want just by
tapping it once and if you want a long
press you just press and hold and on the
left click and it grabs it for you just
like you would when you long press but
honestly I don't see how useful a mouse
really is on a touchscreen I think it's
kind of cool just to be able to do it
but I don't know how practical it is but
something I do think is practical is
connecting a USB keyboard so I'll go
ahead and unplug this guy and get my
keyboard alright so I'm gonna go ahead
and plug in my keyboard right here so
here's the other end of the USB again
I'll connect it right here like that and
let's see if I have my notepad open okay
so let's go to notepad
new text alright so I'll go ahead and
start typing on my keyboard so I'm in a
kind of weird position right now so I'm
not gonna be always have like I normally
do but hopefully you'll get the point so
right now I am typing on my keyboard
this is a lot better than typing on the
phone itself especially if I am writing
a long email so you get the point
pretty much everything works and not
only that you could actually not other
than typing you could actually cook
control some masters phone such as back
you press escape and it'll go back you
can escape out of there you can use the
directional pad to select things for
example I can go to my games tap on it
and choose what game I want just by
using the directional pad again hit
escape for that to back out of it so
it's pretty cool you can also connect
other devices like the Xbox 360
controller which I do for you know games
like GTA supported natively otherwise
you don't have to download an app that
you know lets you modify the control so
it works with other games but in the
future we see we should see more and
more games supporting this because it's
new to Ice Cream Sandwich and definitely
something I'd like to see alright that's
pretty much it for this video I just
wanted to give you a quick demo
demonstration thank you for watching it
and don't forget to visit 4.com for more
cellphone news reviews and how to's
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
