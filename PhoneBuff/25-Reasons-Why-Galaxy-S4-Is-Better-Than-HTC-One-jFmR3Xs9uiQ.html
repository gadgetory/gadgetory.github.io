last time we did a video like this which
you can find annotated somewhere in the
screen or right below that like button
up this video we looked at reasons why
the HTC one was better than the Samsung
Galaxy s4 but this time around is the
galaxy s4 it's time to shine so we're
gonna go over 25 that's right
25 reasons why the Samsung Galaxy s4
it's better than the HTC One now look
now every reason is gonna be that
must-have feature for you but that's why
we're going over 25 reasons so I'm sure
you're gonna find more than a few that
you're gonna really like and with that
said let's go ahead and get right into
it
reason number one the galaxy s4 has a
larger 5-inch display compared to the
4.7 inch screen found on the HTC One
giving you more screen real estate
without making the phone any bigger
- just like with this screen the galaxy
s4 has a larger battery as well at 2600
milliamps compared to the 2300 milliamp
battery found in the HTC One which
combined with this energy-efficient
Super AMOLED display gives you better
battery life overall 3 speaking of the
battery unlike the HTC One the galaxy
s4's battery is removable so you can
swap it out whenever you see fit for
while we're taking a look under the hood
yet another reason why the s4 is better
than the one is the fact that it has a
micro SD card slot meaning that you can
expand your memory up to an additional
64 gigabytes reason number five the
galaxy s4 has a physical home button
that feels more naturally placed at the
center and it also has a dedicated menu
button which makes accessing in-app
settings a little bit more convenient 6
on the topic of button layout the galaxy
s4 is power button is placed at the side
of the phone instead of up top like on
the HTC One which makes it a lot easier
to reach and if that isn't easy enough
for you you can also turn on the screen
by simply pressing the physical home
button 7 despite having a bigger screen
and a larger battery the galaxy s4 still
manages to be both thinner and lighter
than the HTC One 8 on the galaxy s4 you
can easily manage most of your settings
with wireless toggles in the
notification bar whereas on the HTC One
you have to go
through the main system settings to do
so 9 while this may change depending on
when you're watching this the Galaxy s4
comes with a newer version of Android
which could be a sign of things to come
as for our software updates go reason
number 10 the galaxy s4 is 13 megapixel
camera offers higher resolution photos
compared to the HTC One S 4 megapixel
shooter giving you better overall image
quality which is especially noticeable
when zooming in 11 speaking of the
camera the galaxy s4 gives you the
option to pause the video recording and
then resume it at a later time
letting you capture only the moments
that you want 12 the galaxy s4 has more
camera modes and options compared to the
1:1 of which that's worth mentioning
here is dual shot where the galaxy s4
takes pictures or records videos from
the front facing and rear cameras
simultaneously 13 another camera feature
on the s4 is the volume buttons can be
used to zoom in and out just like on the
one but they can also be configured to
take pictures or record videos which can
be easier to use especially when you're
taking self-portraits using the rear
camera 14 easy mode while this mode may
not be something you fumbles we use the
easy mode home screen is great for those
who aren't as tech savvy making the UI
is super simple with larger text reason
number 15 unlike on the HTC One you can
enable a battery percentage icon to show
up right in the notification bar which
helps you keep track of your battery
without having to fumble through the
settings 16 while both phones have 2
gigabytes of RAM the s4 uses faster ddr3
RAM compared to the DDR 2 and the one
and it also has more of that RAM
available to begin with 17 speaking of
RAM and the multitasking view on the s4
you can close all your open apps with
just a single button press whereas on
the one you'd have to close each and
every app individually 18 multi window
Android is great for multitasking in
general but the galaxy s4 takes this one
step further with multi window which
lets you run multiple apps on the screen
at the same time 19 on the galaxy s4 you
can interact with your phone without
having to physically touch it with air
view and air gestures simply hold your
finger over the screen to activate air
view which lets you get a sneak peek at
things like text messages and photos in
an album
you can wave your hand across the screen
to use air gestures which lets you do
things from answering calls the
scrolling down an article page web page
reason number 20 not only can you use a
screen without touching it but you can
also use it while wearing gloves are
using other objects which is great for
those of you who live in colder climates
or have longer nails wait did I just use
keys to touch the screen aren't I
worried that the screen will get
scratched honestly no I'm not and that's
because reason number 21 the galaxy s4
is better than the HTC One is that it
uses the newer more damage resistant
version of Gorilla Glass in Gorilla
Glass 3 which corning says is up to
three times more damage resistant than
the Gorilla Glass 2 found on the HTC one
22 with smart alert the Galaxy S 4 will
vibrate when you pick it up letting you
know you have a new message which is
nice because it means that you don't
have to wait for the led to flash or
turn on the screen to find out if you
miss anything like you would have to do
on the 123 although both the HTC One and
the galaxy s4 have Google now the s4
also comes with s voice which can do
certain things that Google's voice
search can like toggling wireless
connections or recording a voice memo
right into their pre-loaded voice
recording app and much more 24
integrated with s voice is voice control
where you can do just what the name
implies and control the Galaxy s4 with
just your voice to answer calls snooze
or stop an alarm and even take pictures
snooze ok we're finally here reason
number 25 the s and Galaxy S 4 most
likely stands for smart considering all
the quote unquote smart features that it
comes with including smart scroll which
lets you scroll up and down webpages
just by tilting your head smart pause
which like the name suggests pauses a
video when you look away and a whole
bunch of other smart branded features
which reminds me number 26 and 27 28 and
Beyond can be found in the link to
fumble comm right below the like button
