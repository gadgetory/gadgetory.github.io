due to popular demand i am back with yet
another fumble of style speed test this
time between the samsung galaxy s5 and
the HTC One m8 now for those of you who
are new to this channel or don't know
exactly what a fumble style speed test
is basically we're gonna be doing here
is racing each of these phones through
what i like to call a virtual obstacle
course to see which one is actually
faster in the real world alright so
before we get this Bombo style speed
test started i want to let you guys know
that both ones are connected to the same
Wi-Fi network and each is coming off
your fresh reboot so it'll be as fair of
a test as we can possibly get it so with
that said we'll begin to test by
starting these stopwatches in each bone
and heading into the camera apps where
the HTC one takes in early lead and
moves on to the Settings app so right
out the gate the galaxy s5 struggled a
bit with the camera but going into
Temple Run 2 and still being very very
early in the speed test it's looking to
make a comeback but the HTC One isn't
going to make it easy on the s5 with it
finishing up on Temple Run 2 n moving on
to the next up in this gaming portion of
this test in real boxing finishing up
Temple Run 2 in joining the HTC One and
loading up real boxing the galaxy s5 is
about 5 or so seconds behind the HTC one
which isn't insurmountable by any means
as we're just still half way into the
speed test but with the m8 showing
absolutely no signs of slowing down if
the galaxy s5 wants a real shot at
making a comeback I better do it sooner
rather than later so with the done
loading the vector app the HTC One moves
on to Angry Birds where the galaxy s5
finishes up vector but it seems to hang
up a bit while exiting out of the app
pushing it further behind the m8 which
with it trying to make a comeback and
all it's just about the last thing it
needed the HTC One is blissing through
the video transcoding part of this test
which really stresses the processors of
the phone's putting those quad-core
Snapdragon 801 chips to the test and
technically speaking because the s5s
processor is clocked slightly higher it
should be able to narrow the gap between
it in the one
here if only by a little but regardless
of whether or not this actually happened
in reality the s5 is now roughly ten
seconds behind the HTC One with only
four more apps to go before each of
these phones hits the finish line
finishing up the Netflix stream the HTC
One m8 moves on to the score mobile app
putting it about a full app ahead of the
galaxy s5 so the chances of a comeback
here are looking very very bleak for the
s5 but there still is that two-stage
browser test so if the HTC One happens
to struggle here and the galaxy s5
really chugs along there might be a
chance but as you guys can see the HTC
One is just showing no signs of mercy
and it's rendering that full verge site
with the galaxy s5 just now getting into
the mobile version of the verge site and
there you go you can see that the HTC
One finishes with an official time of
two minutes and 18 seconds the galaxy s5
is still chugging along trying to load
up all the content on the media rich
verge site and it looks like it's just
about done it finishes with a time of 2
minutes and 31 seconds making the clear
winner for this phone book style speed
test the HTC One m8 all right guys that
about wraps it up for me in this speed
test if you liked the video give it a
big thumbs up to show you love and if
you like the kind of videos we make here
