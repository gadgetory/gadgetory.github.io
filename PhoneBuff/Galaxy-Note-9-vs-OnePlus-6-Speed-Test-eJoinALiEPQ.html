and the 1 plus 6 are powerful phones we
know that they both have the snapshot in
845 we know that a listen they're
higher-end models they both have 8 two
gigabytes of RAM and we know that
there's a huge difference when it comes
to their pricing but today's speed test
is about what we don't already know and
that is whether or not the 1 plus 6 can
stay on top and remain undefeated or if
the note 9 can beat it and become the
new speed test champ let's find out with
the power in your smart phone and which
artificial design intelligence you can
build a website run on your phone in
just minutes
no robot required big thanks to Wix for
sponsoring this video we're with their
AI building a site on your phone is as
simple as answering a few questions
uploading some photos and picking a
theme that best matches your style or if
you want more fine control you can use
the drag-and-drop editor on your
computer like I did to get everything
looking just the way you want either way
you can start your own website for free
at the link below all right we'll kick
this thing off like we always do by
starting the stopwatches on each phone
and then jumping into the first row of
apps where the 1 plus 6 is able to get
the step over the note 9 in Starbucks
moving on to word as both phones work on
opening the same 500 page documents with
the 1 plus 6 actually being able to do
so at a faster rate
improving on its early lead as it heads
into excel where once again it's able to
finish first with it quickly launching
the camera app to take that selfie and
already working on editing that selfie
here in Snapseed but the note 9 is still
right there behind it joining the 1 plus
and editing the photo applying the same
filter and exporting the image and what
looks like to be roughly the same amount
of time let's see if the note 9 can make
up some ground here in laps it's where
each phone is gonna be creating a
time-lapse from the same exact 6 second
clip but from the looks of it the 1 plus
6 was able to process that time-lapse at
a slightly faster rate allowing it to
create just a little bit more separation
between it and the note 9 as it finishes
up with Google Trends and moves on to
the gaming row so while the no 9 has
fallen a bit behind here
it can still easily make the come back
at this point both phones have been
through some really intensive tasks and
as a result the temperatures on both
phones have gone up so there is a chance
that the improved water carbon cooling
system on the note 9 can actually help
it here in the first lap as in theory it
should make the no nine run cooler and
therefore prevent the odds of it thermal
throttling of course that cooling system
will only make a difference if the one
plus six runs into thermal throttling
issues itself which at least so far just
doesn't seem to be the case with it
edging out the note 9 through the gaming
row and just flying through the last few
apps here in the first lap as moves on
to netflix while the note 9 stumbles a
bit on ESPN allowing the 1 plus 6 to
gain its biggest lead on its way to
clocking in a time of 2 minutes and 3
seconds with the no 9 finishing the
first lap 8 seconds later with the time
of 2 minutes and 11 seconds okay so with
both phones officially in the second lap
and with both olds having a whopping 8
gigabytes of RAM I fully expect both of
them to keep all these apps open and
ready to go however it is worth noting
that the 6 gigabyte version of the note
9 did failed to keep Starbucks and
Facebook open at the end
so hopefully the no 9 with 8 gigabytes
will be able to do the job the one plus
six shows that it can do the job easily
completing the test with the total time
of 2 minutes and 38 seconds with no 9
having no issues either coming in 8
seconds later at the time of 2 minutes
and 46 seconds making the winner and
still form of style speech as champ the
1 plus 6 if you guys want to see how the
1 plus 6 in the note 9 ranked with all
of the other phones that we've tested
