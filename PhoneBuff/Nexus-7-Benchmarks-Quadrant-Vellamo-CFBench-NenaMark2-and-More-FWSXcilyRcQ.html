then this is going to be doing a full on
benchmarking of the Nexus 7 tablet from
google manufactured by asus so we're
doing a couple benchmark tests and be
doing volim oh quadrant nano mark
linpack CF bench and also a browser
market benchmark so let's go ahead and
get started we'll start off with volim
oh and I'll just kind of skip through
the whole test so that way guys can get
straight to the results so let's start
and I'll just kind of skip through it
you
so the balama bedroom work is done we'll
hit yes and we'll get the comparison
chart so I don't know if you guys can
see that it says your device are your
score right over here so it's right
underneath the HC one XL all right above
the HTC One X and it looks like we got
you know somewhere between 1500 2000
probably around you know 1750 and that
we can actually see that I let's go
ahead and hit last numbers yeah 1746 so
pretty good guest by me but let's go
ahead and let you guys see the
individual scores really quick for each
category so the base score for Sun
canvas was 5191 for deep-sea 66 103 and
I'll just kind of scroll through so you
guys can see each individual test score
and I also post these on foam buff com
so if you didn't get a catch it in the
video then go ahead and hit the link
below to see the article now we'll go
ahead and close this app out and we'll
run the quadrant standard or a quadrant
professional benchmark stress a so I'll
go ahead and run full benchmark there
you go so i'll go ahead and let this guy
go through again and let you guys see
the score
alright so the quadrant test is done and
you can see the device scored a 3808 so
a little bit lower than the Asus
Transformer Prime which also has the
same process and video take it three the
HT 1x a little bit higher than both of
those guys that's a high score is a kind
of expecting a little bit of a higher
score but honestly not that bad seems
like you know the Nexus devices seem to
score a little bit lower on these
benchmark tests than some of the other
devices out there so anyway we'll go
ahead and run neta mark now so put it in
landscape and again I'll skip to the end
so you guys can see the result
alright so scored a 55.9 as you guys
could see we'll go ahead and hit back
and close out of it again I was
expecting a higher score considering you
know some of the other phones with the
s4 processor which you know technically
they take a three you expect to be more
powerful switch in the Department of
graphics got a 59 so anyway let's go
ahead and run linpack now linpack I'm
just going to run a bunch of tests and
let you guys see you know kind of get
the feel for the average so i'll hit run
multithread and i got 67 138 1021 4098
and 134 so kind of you guys sees all
over the map um not consistent at all I
mean usually you know it does jump up
and down obviously but within maybe 25
plus or minus 25 this time I was getting
like plus or minus 70 so not sure if
this app is optimized yet for you know
this version of Android or this device
in particular but we'll go ahead and
take those scores for what the word and
let's run CF bench now so CF bench hit
full benchmark and again I'll skip to
the results alright so the benchmark is
done let's go ahead and scroll down to
the bottom so we see the results so I'll
let you guys take a quick look at all
the scores we got here let's go ahead
and zoom in and kind of scroll slowly
for those of you guys who are interested
hopefully the camera focuses seems like
it's not let me zoom out a little bit
there you go all right so i'll go ahead
and scroll slowly through these so you
guys could see the scores that i got for
each section and down at the bottom we
got the comparison with other devices so
you see the galaxy s3 is right over here
at the top HTC One X and then it says
your device so the score I got was you
know 20,000 611 then 5675 and eleven
thousand six hundred forty nine so
pretty close to the HT 1x as you know is
pretty much expected considering that
the same processor obviously this guy
you know as a different phone just
running a different version of Android
so take those things into consideration
but that is that for that test let's go
ahead and back out of here and let's run
our last test which is
the browser Merrick benchmark again same
thing I'll skip to the results
alright so the browser mark benchmark
test is done and as you can see you got
a really high score 130 1451 using
google chrome which is obviously stock
on the nexus 7 you know finally I feel
like we got a high score seemingly you
know what the devices deserves because
so far device seems to be really fast
and smooth obviously everything with
jellybean is but uh anyway that's it for
me in this video hopefully these
benchmarks help give you a better idea
as far as the performance expect but
keep in mind you know real world
performance is a little bit different I
feel like the bench warrants were
honestly I out on the lower side then
you know what you'd get in real life
I'll be doing comparisons with the next
seven with some other devices like other
android phones and maybe even the ipad
so stay tuned for those but you found
