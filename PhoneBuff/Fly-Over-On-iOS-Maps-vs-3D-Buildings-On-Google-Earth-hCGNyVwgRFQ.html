in this video meeting a comparison
between the flyover feature on iOS maps
and the 3d buildings on Google Earth
basically I want to see you know what
differences between the two I have a map
of Las Vegas loaded up on both devices
here and we'll be taking a 3d look at
the pelagic building so we'll go ahead
and zoom in on both phones here so zoom
in here zoom in here and at first glance
in love my first impression is that the
3d building here on iOS maps looks a
little bit more realistic than it does
on Google Earth I feel like the 3d
builds in Google Earth a little bit more
cartoonish I'll go I didn't zoom in a
little more so you guys could actually
see what I'm talking about
so zoom in that close here and like that
over here so bring it up close to the
camera so basically you can see you know
you see more of the detail on the iOS
maps and it just looks more realistic
you know you get pretty much a cartoon
looking you know 3d building on Google
Earth here I mean the detail is great
you know I'm not complaining about that
but it definitely does look more
realistic on iOS maps go ahead and take
a look at something else
we'll take a look at the we'll do we'll
do the water over here so let me just
zoom in on the water all right there you
go so you can see the water here is just
pretty much you know a blur of blue
nothing much there you know not a lot of
detail we'll do the same thing on iOS
Maps and you know still a blur of blue
but the only difference here is that you
know we see some sparkles in the water
the reflection of the sky so it does
definitely look a little bit more
realistic again that seems to be the
theme so far we'll go ahead and zoom out
now one thing Google Earth has that iOS
Maps is not you know when you're looking
at this 3d you know Bellagio building
you actually see the water show on
Google Earth I mean at least a freeze in
time of the water show so you can
actually see the water you know what it
would look like if you're actually to
look at it so pretty cool little feature
there
you know you look at i/o s maps and it's
off there's nothing there so that's a
cool little feature we'll take a look at
the little restaurant here it's called
the Jasmine restaurant I think it's a
restaurant I'm not sure but well look at
it first on the iOS maps on the iPhone
you can see you know it does look
realistic once again do it three look at
it you see the trees surrounding it and
I mean looks pretty good we'll go ahead
and look at the other side and this is
as close as I could get I can't get any
closer so we'll go ahead and try the
same thing on Google Earth and 3d
buildings so zoom in and you know right
away you can tell I'm getting a lot
closer to what I'm trying to get at then
I was on iOS maps and you know you
clearly see the Jasmine sign right there
you know it is a little more cartoony
but because we're able to get closer I'm
able to take a better look at it you can
see the trees aren't here on this side
but the trees look a little bit
different well you know the trees that
are there so you actually see it's like
kind of like a 3d tree here obviously
it's not completely rounded they're just
like little edges you know these little
like little basically branches coming
out of the tree not necessarily a full
tree we're on iOS maps looks a little
bit different see if I can take a look
at a tree so you get more of the you
know the full tree but then again you're
not able to look at as closely and if
you zoom out from here you can't really
tell that there are little twigs
basically so that is that let's go ahead
and turn around and look at the trees
over here so all right so we see the
street over here see the trees again see
how they look they're like kind of
almost like morphed into like one piece
instead of showing individual branches
there and then we'll take a look at this
little Highfill tower in Paris and 3
look at this guy so details really good
again it does look you know pretty
realistic here we'll do the same thing
on Google Earth so I'll turn this guy
around take a look at the trees really
quick so
you see there's more trees on Google
Earth you know seems like there's a
little bit more detail when it comes to
the trip itself and then we'll take a
look at the Eiffel Tower again and this
one looks pretty much the same as it did
on iOS maps I'd say it's a little bit
more realistic on iOS Maps than over
here but not too big of difference as it
was you know on the Bellagio building
itself so yeah I mean that's pretty much
it I mean that's the difference I've
seen so far between iOS Maps and Google
Earth basically I'd have to say Google
Earth maybe is a little bit more detail
as far as you know all the things you
can see but it looks a little bit more
realistic on iOS maps so that's pretty
much the difference you know they're
both great I don't know which one I
prefer you know sometimes I prefer the
iOS Maps one because it looks a little
bit you know more realistic so it's
pretty cool to look at it that way of
course you know we have Street View here
on you know Android wear iOS maps
doesn't have that yet or I don't think
it ever will but anyways that's pretty
much it for me and this video I just
wanted to show you guys the difference
you know I know a lot of you guys were
wondering you know what is flyover any
different from 3d buildings but that's
pretty much it for me in this video if
