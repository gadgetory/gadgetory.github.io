has officially unveiled the 5.1 inch
Galaxy s7 along with the bigger 5.5 inch
galaxy s7 edge while the two devices
look very similar to their predecessors
Samsung has added some great new
features that make these new galaxies
better than ever in this video we're
going to take a look at ten of the best
new features that come with Samsung's
latest flagships one design so the first
thing we'll talk about is design and to
be honest there isn't a whole lot of
change in the way the s7 looks compared
to the s6 but that's not necessarily a
bad thing as the Essex was arguably one
of the best-looking phones in 2015 the
galaxy s7 and s7 edge carry over the
same premium glass in metal materials we
saw in the s6 but this time the glass is
slightly curved around the back of the
s7 and around the back and front of the
s7 edge Samsung says these curves will
result in not only the phones being more
comfortable to hold in the hand but also
make the phones a little bit easier to
grip as well aside from that the only
other design changes worth noting are
the bezels are now even thinner than
they were on the s6 and the camera lens
now protrudes just half a millimeter
from the back marking a big improvement
over the s6 you'll have four color
options to choose from and what Samsung
is calling black onyx gold platinum
silver titanium and a white pearl so
overall a pretty good improvement on
what was already a great design to water
and dust resistance while the galaxy s5
had water and dust resistance it came
with the cost of a less than stellar
design with plastic flaps you had to
open close every time you wanted to
charge the phone the s6 on the other
hand had the great design that the s5
lacked but it came with the cost of not
having water resistance on the s7 you
finally get the best of both worlds with
the great design we talked about earlier
complete with ip68 water and dust
resistance along the s7 to be submerged
in up to five feet of water for up to 30
minutes at a time
and since the phone is sealed internally
instead of externally there are no
annoying flaps that you'll ever have to
worry about three performance Samson is
claiming that the s7 CPU is 30% faster
than the one on the s6 with the GPU
being a whopping 60 percent faster now
these numbers could depend on which
variant of the galaxy
seven Samson was talking about as some
regions like the US will be getting an
s7 with Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chip
while other regions will come equipped
with Samsung's own Exynos eight octa
trip but either way both variants will
be packing four gigabytes RAM for better
multitasking and both variants will have
a new liquid cooling system which should
allow the processor to work harder for
longer without having to throttle itself
down translation the s7 is going to be
stupid fast and promises to make for
some very interesting form of style
speed tests for gaming speaking of
performance the s7 and s7 edge look to
up your gaming experience being the
first smartphones to feature the Vulcan
API
samsung says this next-generation
graphics API will help deliver a PC
quality gaming experience on the galaxy
s7 and to complement it the s7 will be
coming with a new game launcher that
lets you control things like how much
battery a game is using whether or not
you want to be interrupted by
notifications while playing the ability
to lock the capacitive buttons to
prevent accidentally backing out of a
game and even a screen capture mode to
record your best gaming moments 5 hybrid
SIM card slot one of the biggest
complaints people had about the Galaxy
s6 was the fact that it didn't come with
a microSD slot like previous galaxy s
devices had and thankfully Samsung heard
these complaints bringing back SD
support on the s7 with a new hybrid SIM
slot that allows for either a dual SIM
setup or one SIM and one micro SD card
set up that allows you to expand the 32
gigabytes of internal storage by up to
an additional 200 gigabytes and a C card
on the s7 will work just like an SD card
did on the s5 allowing you to store
media and certain apps to the card
unfortunately the s Evan won't support
Android marshmallows new adoptable
storage feature Samsung's reasoning is
that the feature could cause confusion
for consumers since you can't just
remove an adopted SD card and put it
into another device it's a bit of a
letdown but I do get where Samsung is
coming from and hopefully there'll be a
workaround available for us foam buffs 6
fast charging the Galaxy S six supported
fast charging and the same will be true
on the galaxy s7 but on the s7 you'll
have support for fast wireless charging
where a 15 watt wireless charging pad
can charge the s7 faster wirelessly than
a standard wired charger good
considering that slow charging speeds
had been one of the knocks on
wireless charging this is a much welcome
feature seven always on display samsung
says that on average we check our phones
over a hundred and fifty times a day so
to make things a little bit more
convenient the galaxy s7 hasn't always
on display that'll let you see things
like the time the date and any missed
notifications without having to wake the
screen and thanks in part to the galaxy
s7 energy-efficient Super AMOLED display
this feature won't have too much of an
impact on battery life using up less
than 1% of battery per hour the
always-on display can be customized to
your liking with different clock styles
and photos available for download making
it one of those little features that I'm
really looking forward to eight battery
the battery life on the galaxy s6 was ok
it certainly wasn't the best battery out
there and it wasn't the worst either but
with their new phones Samsung looks to
improve battery life by including a
larger 3000 milliamp battery on the
galaxy s7 and a huge thirty six hundred
million battery on the s7 edge the
larger capacity along with new hardware
and software optimizations should make
the s7 last few easily throughout the
day maybe even two days in the case of
the galaxy s7 edge 9 edge panels both
the galaxy s6 edge and the s6 edge+
featured edge panels that give you quick
and easy access to certain apps with a
simple swipe from the edge of the screen
and the same can be done on the galaxy
s7 edge but the difference is on the S
Evan edge the edge panel is bigger with
the panel nearly doubling in size from
260 pixels on the s6 edge to 550 pixels
on the s7 edge this translates into more
information being displayed on the
panels which combined with the newly
released edge panel SDK should make the
edge panels on the s7 edge a lot more
useful than they were on the s6 10
camera samsung did something I never
really expected them to do with the
camera on the s7 and that is that they
lower the megapixel count down from 16
megapixels on the s6 to 12 megapixels on
the s7 as he phonebooks already know by
now a higher megapixel count doesn't
always translate into better quality so
Samsung finally stopped the spec Wars
and lower the megapixel count on the
phones in exchange for a larger sensor
with larger pixels the sensor can now
open up to an f-stop of 1.7 which is
larger than any others
fireball on the market and the s7 is
also the first smartphone to feature
dual pixel technology that are allowed
for crazy fast autofocus even in
low-light conditions combined the 1.7
f-stop and dual pixels on the galaxy s7
s camera less than 95 percent more light
than the galaxy s6 s camera which should
translate into a brighter and sharper
image but we can't judge the s7 s camera
until we've put it through our tests
based on the fact that the s6 this
camera was one of the best out there the
s7 s camera looks like it will take it
to the next level and possibly be the
best camera on a smartphone period so
those are our top 10 best new features
on the galaxy s7 and s7 edge we have a
bunch of coverage coming up on both
devices so be sure you subscribe to

any of our new videos thank you for
watching and as always I'll see you in
the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
