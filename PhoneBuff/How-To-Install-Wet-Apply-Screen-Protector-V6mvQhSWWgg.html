calm and in this video we'll show you
how to apply the zag invisible shield on
your phone you can see I got a Purdy HTC
One S so I've got my 1 s right over here
and I'm gonna apply this screen cover to
this phone but before I do it of course
I gotta take it out of the box so take
this guy out really quick and you can
see inside the box there's a screen
cover right here so I'll go ahead and
pull this guy out and I'll put it to the
side and I will get the rest of it out
so get rid of the box you see I have the
little solution space I'm go ahead and
open this guy up really quick so this is
Lucia spray it's important to keep this
so that to the side and I'll open up
just really quick I could get it open
alright there you go I should opened up
or I start recording anyway I'm you can
see you have a microfiber cloth to a
clean off your screen and then this
little rubber squeegee so make sure you
keep everything you can use your own
microfiber cloth obviously I was gonna
use the one on here you really want to
make sure that your screen is clean and
I'll put it yeah when you apply the
screen cover put put your phone in an
environment that isn't dusty or anything
so that way you know dust doesn't
actually go in your screen because you
really don't want to trap dust
underneath the screen cover and you'll
be stuck looking at it forever so anyway
I'm gonna go ahead and wipe off my
screen making sure there's absolutely
nothing on here alright so down my
screen cleaned and we'll go ahead and
apply it so what you're going to do is
you're going to take off the screen
cover from this little paper backing so
let's go ahead and take it off so you
can see the first layer is just the
little plastic protecting and second
layer is what you want so we're going to
pull this guy off try not to get your
fingerprints on them
and what we're going to do here is how
we're going to spray the screen cover on
both sides so I'm going to move the
phone out of the way and I'll go ahead
and spray this guy so make sure you hear
it in an environment you don't mind
getting a little bit wet so be kind of
generous with a spray I like to be
because seriously I do not want to have
to worry about it getting stuck on the
screen because that's no fun so anyway
we'll just do a few sprays on this side
and uh get the phone back so I let's try
the soft real quick I wanna get my phone
away anyway well put this guy on so I
didn't get the top left corner sprayed
so let's do that really quick all right
see how my screen is completely soaked
I'm going to go ahead and put it on the
phone so put this guy on the phone and
I'd be careful I mean try to get it on
you know right the first time so that
way you don't have to worry about it and
you know if it does get stuck you don't
have to worry about that don't worry
about the water too much right now
obviously you don't want to get it you
know in the port or anything but get
this guy on so the way you apply it to
just a tip is when you set it down from
the bottom kind of like work your way up
like that so then don't just place it
all at once
and if you mess up like me like okay
there's been a few times I've been
trying it and I just been messing up so
I'm just going to spray it one more time
because I want to make sure that this
guy doesn't get stuck so spray it again
really soaking it all right I'm try to
use two hands here keep slipping there
you go
so I've got this guy on there looks
pretty good so now I'm just going to
start squeezing it so when you squeeze
it you want to go from the inside out so
we're way way out from the inside out so
I'm going to hold the screen cover kind
of in place and just kind of slowly
squeegee the the screen cover so just
like that from the inside out and make
sure like when you when the water comes
out from the sides you wipe it off real
quick cuz you don't want your phone to
get like water damage so I'm just gonna
wipe it off really quick and I'll just
keep on going from the inside out
all right so as you can see um there's a
few little bubbles in here so I'm just
going to try to get it out over time
over the next couple of minutes and I
just keep working at it you know with
your phone Arwa with TS squeegee slowly
you know and firmly with this rubber
squeegee the great thing about the
rubber squeegee is not going to scratch
the actual screen protector and just
keep working at it from the inside out
and eventually you know most of the air
bubbles or water bubbles will be gone
and that once they are and you know
there might be a few left over just give
it a couple of hours maybe even when I
think they say 24 hours I was AG says it
could take for the bubbles come out but
anyway they eventually do and that once
it's done it'll look like this guy over
here so I got it on my Galaxy Nexus got
the screen protector I mean you can look
how clean it looks definitely love it
so you know somewhat fingerprint
resistant and that provides you know one
of the best protections for your screen
that you could possibly get without
making the clarity of the screen any
worse oh by the way don't freak out you
know your phone screen might not look
good when you are when you unlock it or
when you're looking at after your pot it
because it's still wet I'm just give it
a while and it will clear up but anyway
