calm and in this video I'm doing a speak
comparison test between the Qualcomm
Snapdragon s3 processor found on the
samsung galaxy note from AT&amp;amp;T and the
Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 processor their
latest processor found on t-mobile's HTC
One S so I'm just basically going to
open up two apps to see which one opens
up on each phone first and also I'm
gonna run two benchmark tests being
quadrant standard and it's in two so
anyway I'm gonna go ahead and do the
first test which is opening up Flixster
on each phone so I'm gonna try to tap
them at the same time before it does I
want to show you that they are closed on
both phones in the background and both
phones are on the same Wi-Fi network so
we're getting as in this test that we
could get for right now so with that
said I'll go ahead and open them both up
at the same time so one two three and
it's pretty close I mean this is a
fairly small app so both are more able
to open up at the same time we'll go
ahead and hit skip really quick and
again they're pretty close I'm really
hard to tell the difference let's see if
we could open up a let's say a video
from each one so open up battleship on
each one and then we'll hit play trailer
so play a trailer and see which one
starts playing first so it actually
started playing first on the samsung
galaxy note with the s2 processor of
course we expect the s4 processor to
beat out the s3 processor but yeah and
that test looks like the galaxy note
with the s3 is a little bit faster squad
and open up another movie so we'll do
dictate it really quick and then hit
play trailer and again two for two so it
definitely is a little bit faster on the
s3 now that might be because of TouchWiz
optimizations to the OS compared to HTC
Sense they're not stock Android so it's
kind of hard to test for that but we'll
go ahead and open up the next app and
that is score Center so one two three in
this up clearly the HTC One S with the
standard units for processor definitely
opened up a lot faster than did
the Gauss note so that's expected and
the difference is so large that I'm not
gonna go ahead and test it again well
let's go ahead and do the benchmarks now
so I'm just gonna go ahead and close out
those two apps and we'll close out those
two apps on here
I accidentally open up the camera all
right so let's go ahead and run the
quadrant benchmark so we'll do quadrant
at the same time and I'll go ahead and
run the test I'll pause the video really
quick while it's doing its thing and as
soon as it's done
I will unpause so I'm go ahead and press
this and again I'll just unpause it as
soon as it's done all right so both
benchmarks are done I'll go ahead and
hit YES on each device and see what this
chord so right here you have the Samsung
Galaxy Note and you can see it scored
8:30 to 12 which is a pretty good score
I mean it's actually one of the highest
scores I've gotten on this device and
here on the HTC One S with the
Snapdragon s4 is a 47 10 so obviously
just by this benford alone you could
kind of get the idea that the s4 is a
lot faster than the s3 as expected we'll
go ahead and hit home out of these guys
and now I'm gonna open up the next
benchmark which is antutu so we'll go
ahead and open this guy up and again
I'll run the test and I'll pause the
video and unpause it as soon as it's
done so it close on this guy will go
straight to the test and we'll hit start
and again I'll go ahead and pause it and
come right back to it as soon as it's
done alright so both tests are done and
as you can see the Galaxy Note with the
s3 scored a 64 68 and the stop dragon s4
on the 1s scored a 70 81 so again the 1s
with the Snapdragon s4 as expected wins
this if you're curious the s4 was
averaging 60 frames per second during
the graphics test where the s3 was
getting about 57 and that may have
accounted for some of the difference
here but overall I'm as you can see you
know other than a quarter benchmark
the two phones are the two processes are
pretty close when it comes to
applications and you know flipping in
and out of them there isn't too big of a
difference however I'm sure you know
with more intensive graphics-intensive
applications it's gonna make a bigger
difference with you know this having the
audrina to twenty five GPU versus Adreno
to 2000 hour clocked at 1.5 gigahertz so
you know overall I have to say that you
know it doesn't really it's not that big
of a difference I mean because the
reason why I was doing this video in the
first place is I was really hoping that
the AT&amp;amp;T version of the Galaxy Note was
gonna get at least the star dragon has
swore since it wasn't giving the akeno's
but overall I mean that s3 is fast
enough on the galaxy note for me you
know I did a speed test comparison with
the the Galaxy Nexus and it didn't beat
it out just like this guy did so they're
both really fast obviously gonna give
the edge to the 1s and you know it's one
of the fastest processors out right now
other than the new Snapdragon or I'm
sorry the akeno's 4 quad which as soon
as I get that out do a test and let you
guys see the difference there but anyway
that's it for me in this video hopefully
you know gives you a better day as far

processors if you found it helpful hit
