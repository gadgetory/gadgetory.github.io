phonebook calm and today I'm going to
show you how to pair a bluetooth headset
or any Bluetooth device for that matter
to your Windows Phone so first thing
you're going to do is go to your home
screen hop into your settings from your
application list from the settings
options you can go to Bluetooth and turn
bluetooth on after you do this you're
going to want to get your Bluetooth
device so in this case I have my plan
Tronics headset and you want to get into
pairing mode so read the manufacturer
instructions on how to do this but for
the most part it's usually pressing and
holding the power button until you get
some kind of notification that it's
impairing mode so in the case of this
headset it's a going to flash so it's
flashing blue and red
as you can see yours might be a little
bit different yours might flash just red
or might say a solid color but as long
as some pairing mode the phone will
connect so you see now it says headset
so the phone found the headset and you
can see now saying connected so keep an
eye on the flashing headset and you see
once it's connected the light goes off
and you see the phone says connected so
now I can listen to music or make phone
calls right on my headset anytime I want
um you know you don't have to do this
every time you connect the headset to
your phone it's just the first time and
the phone will save the settings so
anytime you boot it is on and the
headset is around the to automatically
connect alright that's it for me this
