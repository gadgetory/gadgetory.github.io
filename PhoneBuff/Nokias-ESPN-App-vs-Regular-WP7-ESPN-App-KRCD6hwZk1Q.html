and in this video I want to show you the
difference between the ESPN app on the
Nokia Lumia 900 and the regular old ESPN
app that you find on any Windows Phone
so go ahead and open up both of these
guys basically nokia is telling us that
their version is different it's
exclusive to nokia so we'll go ahead and
look at the differences obviously when
you first open it up you can see there
is a different UI definitely this one
looks better I my opinion at least but
right now you said this one's set on
basketball I'll go ahead and go to the
basketball session so you do have to
navigate a little bit differently than
you would over here if you wanted to
search a sport here you tap on that guy
in down add your sport that way but
anyway we're both at the or what the NBA
page right here so you see the finals
right now so i'll go ahead and tap on
this game on both of these guys and you
see both of them go straight to the
browser obviously the Lumia diner is
gonna be a little bit faster because as
a faster processor but pretty much the
same thing over here so I'll go ahead
and hit back out of here now on the NBA
page I'm not gonna go to other sports
because you know the finals right now so
might as well look here um scroll on the
Lumia you have the news scrollview here
you have news again scroll over and you
have the standings for the team's
regular season when you scroll over
there is no standings I over here this
is the video and then you have social
over here you have video then you're
back to scores again so you have the
video on both but this one has social
which is pretty cool because it gets the
Twitter feeds of you know people in the
NBA and not all the commentators and
stuff so definitely a cool feature to
have on here and if you go over here you
have the team's up tab which is kind of
like the standings because you get the
records and teams had and whatever
dividend there were so if you want to
look at for example the Pacific Division
you know see what the Lakers did you can
see that their 4125 and uh yeah so
anyway those are the differences but
other than that you know other different
the different UI and the social tab
they're pretty much very similar but
there is one key difference between the
Nokia one and that difference is the
live tile so I'll go and hit back over
here and hopefully didn't close yeah
okay so we'll go to scores
I've tile will enable that title so
let's tap on this guy and I just let you
guys on when you hit settings over here
you just have your mind sports options
my team's options and then just basic
ESPN stuff so definitely no option for a
live tile hey home pick over here tile
looks like that it's not going to change
in this case when you hit home we'll go
down we see that same ESPN icon or tile
but if we wait a second we should see a
live score right now I think there's a
baseball game going on right now all
right so I didn't give me the baseball
game it just gave me the the basketball
game i was looking at so once this game
starts going on the scores will show up
right here so i won't even have to open
up the app which is similar to what i
have on android aam have the ESPN app on
Android it has a widget which gives me
the scores which is awesome but on
Windows Phone you know you don't have
that whichever obviously don't widgets
but the live tile option is only
available on the Lumia right now Nokia
so definitely a cool feature but anyway
it's pretty much it for me in this video
hopefully that shows you to between the
two apps and I found this video helpful
hit the like when scribe and don't
forget to visit boom Bop com more cell
phone news reviews and how to's thank
