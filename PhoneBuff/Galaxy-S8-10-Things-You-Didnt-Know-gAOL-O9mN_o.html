probably know a good amount about the
Galaxy s8 you know that it has a big
beautiful infinity display and that the
fingerprint scanner is now on the bag
but is really hard to reach you know
that the navigation buttons are now
software based and that the home button
is always on and pressure sensitive and
finally you know that Samsung added a
dedicated button to the side of the
phone for their new voice assistant
called Bixby not that anyone was really
asking for it so today I figured why not
do something a little bit different and
talk about the things you probably don't
already know starting off with the
higher end a third model that not only
has more RAM at 6 gigabytes instead of
only 4 but it also has more internal
storage at 128 gigabyte it's double
what's available on the other models now
if this sounds like the galaxy s 8 for
you and for me honestly well the bad
news is you can only buy it if you live
in China or Korea unless of course you
plan on importing it but if you don't
want to import and have to give up
things like support for Samsung pay the
second thing you might not know is
Samsung is going to offer an unlocked
model of the Galaxy s8 without any of
the carrier bloatware just three weeks
after the initial launch but be warned
Samsung did a really bad job at updating
the unlocked Galaxy a7 last year which
you would think would kind of be the
other way around but it wasn't and
there's no telling if the story will be
any different with the s8 third thing
you might not know is there will
actually be two different chipsets on
the Galaxy s8 one with Qualcomm
Snapdragon 835 and the other with
Samsung's Exynos 88-90 five and
according to some benchmarks it looks
like the Exynos variant is going to be a
little bit more powerful of course we
all know the full story until our fumble
style speed test thumbs up if you guys
are excited to see that but to be honest
I wouldn't be surprised if the Exynos
variant outperforms
since this is exactly what happened last
year with the s7 the good news is the
fourth thing you might not know is that
all of the s8 variants will be using
faster ufs 2.1 storage compared to you
FS 2.0 which first debuted on the galaxy
s6 this faster storage should improve
things like multitasking app load of
times and file transfer speeds U of S
2.1 should also lead to faster BER shot
and panorama stitching in the camera
while also making photo thumbnails
the gallery load up faster as well which
brings us to the fifth thing that you
might not know which has to do with the
camera so with the help of a new image
signal processor or ISP the s8 is
capable of multi frame processing which
will take multiple photos when you press
the shutter and then use those multiple
frames to create a better looking final
photo this is a lot like what Google is
doing with the pixels hdr+ but it's
happening at a hardware level on the s8
meaning it should take less time for it
to process the photo this allows you to
review it right after you take it
without having to wait for the photo to
finish processing in addition to the isp
the s8 is actually using a new camera
sensor one of the new variants is sony's
IMX 333 which is the same sensor Sony is
using in their upcoming XE premium a
phone that's capable of shooting
slow-motion video at an incredible 960
frames per second but before you get too
excited from what I've seen it doesn't
look like the si will be able to shoot
at 960 fps but the point here is that
the sensor is technically new the six
thing like the camera doesn't look any
better on the spec sheet but is actually
better in reality in an improved battery
no I'm not talking about an improvement
in battery life on any given day but an
improvement in the life of the battery
in any given year according to Samsung
the essays battery degrades much more
slowly than the batteries on other
phones with it having an effective
battery capacity of 95% after eight
years worth of charge cycles for a
comparison the s7 has an effective
battery capacity of only 80% after a
year so if you do the math after a year
of normal charging the s8 battery would
be an effective twenty eight hundred and
fifty million hours compared to the s7
2400 milliamp hours so while the battery
life won't be any better than the s7 on
launch day over time the essays battery
should last you a little bit longer the
seventh thing that you may not know is
something that does show up on the spec
scene and that the s8 is the first phone
to use Bluetooth 5.0 now why does this
matter well in addition to having four
times the range of Bluetooth 4.2
Bluetooth 5.0 also offers two times the
bandwidth one of the benefits of this is
you can push audio over Bluetooth to two
different headphones or Bluetooth
speakers at the same time now while this
is definitely cool the future I'm
actually more excited about is an option
the s8 has two control audio output
at an app level so for example you can
set it so only the audio from your music
app outputs over to your Bluetooth
speaker while the rest of the phone's
audio whether it be a snapchat or a text
message ringtone will come through the
phone's speaker itself the a thing that
you may not know about the galaxy s aids
is it's also the first zone to support
gigabits LTE speeds which is over double
what the s7 can do now for most people
this is overkill as you probably don't
live in an area that supports gigabit
LTE but if you do then no other phone is
going to give you faster data the ninth
thing that you may not know about the
galaxy s AIDS is Samsung didn't
initially plan on putting the
fingerprint scanner on the back it was
originally supposed to be under the
screen where the pressure-sensitive home
button is but apparently they ran into
some issues where like things wouldn't
have been ready in time so they opted to
put the fingerprint scanner on the back
now like that sounds like a reasonable
excuse but at the same time I'm not sure
why they kind of put the fingerprint
scanner a little bit lower but hey at
least Hansen added a gesture that lets
you bring the notification shade down by
swiping on the scanner and then finally
the ten thing that you may not know or
at least there seems to be some
confusion about is no the s8 doesn't
have stereo speakers okay it's a single
bottom firing mono speaker and from what
I can tell it's no better than the
speaker on the s7 maybe only a little
bit louder however Samsung kind of makes
up for this by including AKG headphones
in the box which is supposedly a $99
value but then again they raise the
price of the s8 by $100 over what they
sold the s7 for last year so yeah the s8
is officially more expensive than the
iPhone who would have ever thought
anyways that is it for me in this video
there will be a bunch of coverage on the
s8 coming up soon so make sure you
subscribe if you haven't already thank
you guys for watching and as always I'll
see you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
