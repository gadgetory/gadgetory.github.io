like me to phones that you have been
heavily considering since like back in
November or the Google pixel to excel
and the iPhone 10 I mean these things
are among the best of the best when it
comes to smartphones and choosing
between the two isn't exactly easy so in
this two-part Bombo style video series
we're gonna be going over 25 reasons why
the pixel to excel could be considered
better than the iPhone 10 in this video
and then we'll be doing this same exact
thing in favor of the iPhone in the next
video which I'll be linking for you down
below after watching both videos and be
sure to watch both videos don't be
close-minded vote over here for which
phone you think has the stronger reasons
all right let's get right into it
subtle bear is the easy to use privacy
app that helps keep the activity on your
phone private from hackers and ISPs
while also letting you browse a more
open web from over 20 countries go to a
telecom slash phone buff or click on
that link down below to try it tunnel
bear for free reason number one Google
assistance in general the Google
assistant is just smarter than Siri and
while you can technically get the Google
assistant on the iPhone it doesn't work
anywhere near as well as it does on the
pixel on the pixel to the assistant is
easily accessible by squeezing the edges
of the phone
it comes with google lens which allows
you to search for things using just your
camera and because it's better
integrated with the system it can do
things like check what's on your screen
to give you relevant information and it
can even troubleshoot problems that you
may be having with your phone it's
seriously next level to better VR with
hundreds of apps already available
through Google's daydream platform the
pixel 2 coupled with the daydream view
headsets offers a much better VR
experience than anything you can
currently get on the iPhone 10 three
fast charging adapter both of these
phones technically support fast charging
but unlike the iPhone the pixel actually
comes with a fast charging adapter in
the box whereas on the iPhone
yet the cop up in extra 70 bucks in
order to get the same functionality for
multiple users with support for multiple
users you can create a completely
separate user account for someone like
your kid so you can install the games
and apps that your kid wants to use on
their own
profile and keep all of their stuff
separate from your profile that way you
can just hand them your phone without
having to worry about them getting into
your text messages into your emails and
you can even prevent them from making
phone calls reason number five quick
camera launch from any screen on or off
you can jump right into the pixel twos
camera with a double press of the power
button this not only makes it less
likely that you'll miss a great photo
because you were fumbling around looking
for the camera icon but it also kind of
encourages you to take more photos at
least it does for me six free unlimited
photo storage and there's no reason not
to take a bunch of photos because with
the pixel 2 you get unlimited photo and
video storage at full original quality
something that you'd have to pay a
monthly fee for on the iPhone with
iCloud 7 better selfies the pixel selfie
cam has a wider angle lens which lets
you fit more people or background into
your photos
it has front-facing flash even while
you're recording a video in low light
conditions and despite not having all
those special sensors in the iPhone
tends not the portrait mode on the pixel
tube just looks cleaner with it doing a
better job at not blurring the top of
your head in like your ears which tends
to happen a lot more on the iPhone 10:8
smaller camera humph alright so this is
the last point I'll make about the
camera on the pixel 2 and that said it
doesn't have a big ol protruding camera
lens like the iPhone 10 does so when
it's lying flat on a table you can
actually use it without the phone
rocking back and forth like crazy 9 File
Manager on the pixel 2 you actually get
a real file manager compared to the
limited one that you get on the iPhone
which not only allows you to manage the
folders and files on your phone like you
would on a computer but you can also
drag and drop content from your phone
onto a computer when you connect it
reason number 10 bigger screen the
six-inch screen on the pixel to excel is
not only taller and wider than the 5.8
inch screen on the iPhone 10 but it also
doesn't have a notch that's cutting into
it making it feel even bigger when
watching videos or playing a game
11 multitasking taking advantage of that
bigger screen the pixel to excel has two
different multitasking modes the first
is split screen where you can run two
apps on the screen at the same time
split across the middle with a second
being picture-in-picture which allows
you to run certain apps like
apps in YouTube to run in the corner
while you jump in and out of your other
apps allowing you to do more than just
one thing at a time 12 default
applications you can set your own
default applications on the pixel -
allowing you to permanently replace a
system app with any app of your choosing
for example if you decide that you'd
rather use Firefox as your main browser
instead of using Chrome well you can do
that whereas on the iPhone Apple just
won't let that fly and instead locks you
into the apps that they want you to use
as default which pretty much always are
their own 13 notifications the pixel -
does a better job at handling
notifications with a grouping
notifications per app instead of having
one app take over your whole lockscreen
and with a giving you the ability to
turn off certain categories of
notifications within an app instead of
having to disable all the notifications
outright 14 - our return policy the
pixel to zap store has a two-hour return
period where you can return an app
easily right from the phone itself so
you can try a new app and if it turns
out that you don't like it you won't be
stuck with the purchase and you don't
have to go through the headache of going
through iTunes on a computer just to get
your money back
reason number 15 fingerprint scanner
unlike the iPhone 10 the pixel 2 still
has a fingerprint scanner which not only
allows you to unlock your phone faster
than face ID but it also works with
special gestures that allow you to
reveal and hide the notification shade
with just a swipe 16 two year warranty
the pixel 2 comes with a 2-year warranty
from Google that protects you from any
manufacturer defects that you may
encounter with the phone which is twice
as long as the one year warranty that
apple provides for the iPhone 10 17
cheaper that's eight hundred and fifty
dollars the pixel to excel is a hundred
and fifty bucks cheaper than the
thousand dollar iPhone 10 which is
enough to buy you a case for the phone a
chromecast for your TV a Google home
Mini and still leaving you with twenty
bucks left over to buy any apps that you
may need from the Play Store 18
ambient's display both the iPhone 10 and
the pixel to have a future where when
you lift the phone you get to see the
time and your missed notifications but
the pixels ambient display feature takes
this one step further allowing this same
information to always be available when
the screen is off which can be
a lot more convenient than having to
pick it up every time 19 battery
indicators now only can you see the
battery percentage right there in the
status bar which due to the notch on the
iPhone 10 you can't but the pixel 2 also
gives you estimate for how long he
thinks the battery will actually last
you and how long it thinks it will take
for it to fully charge after you plug it
in reason number 20 longer battery life
while the difference in battery life
isn't quite as drastic as maybe the spec
sheet would have you imagine the bigger
battery on the pixel to Excel does seem
to last longer on average with it
typically having an extra 10 percent or
so at the end of the day compared to the
iPhone in my own personal daily use 21
repairability nobody ever plans on
dropping their phones but accidents
happen so one thing worth noting is the
pixel 2 is significantly cheaper to
repair than the iPhone 10 a broken
screen costs 220 dollars to fix on the
pixel compared to 270 dollars on the
iPhone while a shattered back can cost
up to a whopping 550 bucks on the iPhone
compared to just 160 dollars on the
pixel 22 sharing not only this is a
pixel to give you more options to share
content from one app to another like
being able to take a photo straight from
your gallery to be edited in Photoshop
but it also learns from your sharing
habits over time and starts to put your
most frequently used options
conveniently front and center 23 front
facing speakers both the iPhone 10 and
the pixel two have stereo speakers but
one area where the pixel 2 has the edge
is both of its speakers are front firing
whereas on the iPhone 10 only one of the
speakers is front barring while the
other is bottom firing which isn't
really a problem when you hold a phone
in portrait but when you hold it in
landscape like when you're watching a
video or playing a game that bottom
firing speaker can easily get covered up
by your hand which is something that you
don't have to worry about on the pixel
24 USB OTG with the included USB C 2 USB
a adapter in the Box you can easily
connect USB peripherals like a USB flash
drive a keyboard or even a mouse and
have them work just like they would on a
desktop computer reason number 25 now
playing the now playing feature on the
pixel 2 can automatically show you what
song is playing nearby so this
for example you're at a restaurant and
you hear a song that you like playing in
the background you can just glance over
at your phone and see the name of the
song and who it's by right there on the
lockscreen alright so those were some of
the best reasons why the pixel two could
be considered better than the iPhone 10
if you think I've missed any reasons let
me know down below in the comments but
before I jump out here I want to give a
big thanks to Tuttle bear for sponsoring
today's video so a few weeks ago I was
in Las Vegas for CES and pretty much all
week I was using Tuttle bear on my phone
because naturally I was connecting to a
lot of public Wi-Fi hotspots and using
tile bear I was able to encrypt all my
web traffic making it harder for anyone
monitoring these public Wi-Fi hotspots
to track my activity now using tile bear
itself is easy all you have to do is
open the app select the country that you
want to browse from and Tunnel bear will
securely tunnel you to that country
hiding your IP address in the process
try it son alert for free by visiting
Tunnel bear comm slash phone buff or by
clicking on that link down below in the
description which speaking of our the
link to the iPhone tens video down there
as well so be sure to check that video
out if you haven't already but anyways
that is it for me in this video thank
you guys for watching and as always I'll
see you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
