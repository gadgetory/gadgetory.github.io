calm and in this video we're doing a
review slash how-to on The Voice Actions
feature that comes with Android so
everybody in the comparison between
voice Actions and Windows Phones tell me
and of course the iPhone Siri but in
this video I just want to go more in
depth as far as what voice Actions
brings to the table and some of the
different features offers so first I
want to talk about the things that are
directly related to voice Actions within
the phone itself not Google searches
without doing the second half so let's
show you a few examples of The Voice
Actions features and then of course the
Google searches which really expands the
functionality so the first thing I'll do
is show you an example of how you can
navigate with voice items so navigate to
Del Taco you just give it the phone that
command and you can see it has this
little loading icon right here that's
only because a wants to give you a
chance to hit cancel if it got it wrong
but I could just tap on the nearest el
taco and it automatically give me
directions to that del taco so actually
let me close out of that because it'll
bother me later in the video so hit exit
alright so another example I'll just do
a text message to somebody so send text
to Google search what are you doing
today
and as you can see it's sending a text
to Google search which is in my phone
book and right here it got my message
correctly I can just hit Send if I want
cancel if I don't last feature that I'll
go over is making a call so will this
call let's say my barbershop call barber
shop there you go it's calling my barber
shop so if I hit dial I can just bypass
this waiting time hit cancel if I don't
want it otherwise it'll automatically go
to it so at home and now I really want
to go over to things that you know I
feel like really separate voice actions
from at least tell me because tell me
has a lot of these functions but it
brings it closer to Siri and that's
using Google search so for example you
can do math questions are equations with
your voice so exam four
sample 15 times 2/3 times 4 so you can
see there's a Google search as usual but
at the top you have an answer and the
answer is 40 you can see it wasn't
necessarily the most simple problem that
I gave it it's kind of complicated and
it still got it you know you can do
square roots you can do cosine and all
that stuff so pretty cool of course you
want to do a tip you say 15% of you know
30 bucks whatever your bill is and you
could get that another future is you
could answer that question such as when
was Martin Luther King born and again it
does a Google search but at the very top
and big bold letters do you get the
answer so really quick way of getting to
information without having to type
anything it's very accurate with the
voice on if it's not sure it'll just
give you a few suggestions as far as
what it things said and you can just tap
on it another example is let's say I
wanted to show a friend a picture of the
Xbox because they've never heard of it
somehow
so I could just say picture of Xbox 360
and you can see it doesn't Google search
for it and I've got all these pictures
right away without having to you know
type it in myself hitting the Images tab
and whatnot I just have it right right
here at the front screen so very quick
way of doing things
let's do a couple of more examples so
the first one I'll do is the weather
weather and as you can see I just said
weather because I do have my location
enabled on my phone it's automatically
able to check I'm in Laguna Hills and it
gives me the weather if I wanted to do
movie show times movie show times I
could do the same thing without actually
having to say what city or state I'm in
because it knows my location and it
knows right here these are the theaters
are close to me I can just tap on the
show time I want and you know go from
there so pretty cool if you don't have
the location enabled just say you know
show times and in your city so for me it
be show times look in the Hills another
example is you could actually do
translations right from here so for
example say I wanted to know how to say
hello in
I could just say translate to Spanish
hello and at the very top it says hello
is Ola so again another cool function
that actually replaces my translating
app and speaking of apps that Voice
Actions could actually replace will do
the dictionary too so define dog and you
can see at the very top it has my
definition and it's not just the
definition it's actually interactive
where I can tap on this little icon
right here and actually get the
enunciation so so you can see you know
it's full-featured it pretty much
replaces my need for having a dictionary
app on my phone and it's definitely a
lot quicker than you know opening up my
dictionary app but those are you know
the few examples that I I'll go over I
mean if you want more just hit the links
in the description box below go to
phonebook calm I talked about in more
depth there but you know this video is
getting kind of long so I don't want to
go on anyways found it helpful hit the
