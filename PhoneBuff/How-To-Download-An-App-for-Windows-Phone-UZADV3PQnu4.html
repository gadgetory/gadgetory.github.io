and in this video i will show you how to
download an app from the Windows Phone
Marketplace
so the first step obviously is to open
up the marketplace and I'm just gonna
break this video down into parts first
part I'm just gonna show you how to
download an app second part I'm gonna
show you how to find an app and in terms
of whether or not that app is worth
downloading so the first part we're
gonna click on apps I'm gonna scroll
over to just all apps really quick and
go over to three and then just click on
Adobe Reader and you can see at the very
bottom you have the option to install
tap on that guy and you can see it's
being downloaded and it'll be
automatically installed on your phone so
you see right here it's being downloaded
and as soon as it's done downloading
it'll install and it'll there you go
that's it so it's done downloading so
now go back to the workplace for the
second part of the video and I really
want to show you how to find the good
app so I'm gonna do the same thing and
go to apps but show you some of the
categories so you have the featured apps
right over here
you have your categories that you can
scroll through like entertainment music
video tools and productivity etc you
could go look at the new apps that are
out you can look at the top apps and
like I said the featured app so we'll go
ahead and go to a category let's say I
won a travel actually I helped in
Fitness out so let's hop on health
health and fitness
you have your top applications on this
first screen so I've over to the right
you have your free apps and then your
new apps and the apps within a
subcategory from that section so let's
say I want to die in nutrition app and
again you can get your top apps so say I
want the weight tracker app I can
actually either buy it by pressing Buy
or try it so this is if you because this
is a paid app if it was a free app such
as let's go back one step and look at
free let's say might Fitness Pal it'll
just give me the option to install so
once you're at an apps page you could of
course read the description hit show
details right over here and you could
read what the apps all about it's
probably the best way to determine
whether or not you want an app on your
phone the next thing you look at is what
the phone requires access to so the very
bottom you
see that this app requires access to
your camera your data services phone
identity and that's pretty much for that
you can read the reviews to see what
other people with Windows Phones are
saying about it get their star rating
and also little comments that they leave
and then lastly you look at the
screenshots to see if the user interface
is pretty much what you're looking for
but that's pretty much it it's really
easy and there's a lot of apps on the
Windows Phone Marketplace now there's
over 50,000 so definitely a lot you
could choose from alright that's it for
me in this video it's david bohm with
calm if you found this video helpful hit

forget to visit phonecall calm or cell
phone use reviews and how to's thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
