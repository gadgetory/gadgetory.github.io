on your screen right now are arguably
the two most popular smartphones in the
entire world and the Samsung Galaxy s4
and the Apple iPhone 5s so like we do
all the time here on the fumble channel
and this two-part video series we'll be
going over a bunch of reasons why each
of these smartphones is better than the
other up first is a galaxy s4 where
we'll be looking at any whopping 25
reasons why you can be considered better
than the iPhone 5s let's go ahead and
get right into it
reason number one the galaxy s4 screen
is a full inch or 25% bigger than the
iPhone 5s is making everything from
browsing the web to playing your
favorite games a lot easier on the eyes
too not only is a screen bigger but it's
higher 1080p resolution which gives you
better sharpness also allows for more
content to appear on the screen at once
so you won't have to scroll around as
much 3 since we're talking about the
screen it's worth mentioning that the s4
screen works even when you're wearing
gloves which can be really important
especially if you live in a colder
climate for unlike the iPhone 5s the
galaxy s4 has a removable battery so you
can carry an extra battery on you and
swap it out whenever you see fit and
never really have to worry about your
phone dying on you again reason number 5
the s4 has an expandable microSD card
slot meaning you'll be able to add more
memory whenever you need it just by
throwing an SD card in there 6 the
capacitive buttons on the s4 4 menu and
back make navigating in-app settings and
screens just a tad more convenient which
does make a difference over time 7 the
galaxy s4 has LED notifications which
let you know if you have any new
notifications just by looking at the
phone without having to actually turn
the screen on 8 but if that doesn't do
the trick for you the s4 also has smart
alert which will vibrate the phone when
you pick it up and have missed
notifications so you don't even have to
look at it 9 using the front-facing
camera
the galaxy s4 will keep the screen from
turning off and rotating when you don't
want it to by detecting your face and
eyes with smart stay and smart rotation
reason number 10 similar to smart stay
and smart rotation the s4 also has smart
scroll and smart pause which again uses
the front-facing camera but this time to
scroll up and down webpages and to pause
the video when you look away
in other words you can control the phone
with just your head 11 the s4 has a
feature called air view where you can
get little previews of what your finger
is hovering over so you can see what
you're about to tap before you can do so
12 unlike the iPhone 5s the galaxy s4
has NFC capabilities which allows for
things like tapping two bones together
for file transfer but maybe more
importantly can be used with NFC tags to
automate some of the things you do on an
everyday basis 13 with the galaxy s4 you
can easily connect your phone to just
about any computer without installing
any special software on it and access
all your files drag and drop as you like
and in effect use the phone as a flash
drive with USB mass-storage
14 while you can download and use Google
now on the iPhone 5s the Galaxy s4 has a
much better integrated version of it so
you can find the information you need
before you need it no matter what you're
currently looking at instead of having
to go in and open the Google now app
separately reason number 15 sure the
iPhone 5s has Siri and as we just
pointed out also has Google now but
something it doesn't have is voice
controls where you can take a picture
answer a phone call snooze an alarm and
much more with a simple voice command
here it is in action
snooze capture 16 the Galaxy s4 has more
lock screen options with custom lock
screens available and different ways to
protect that lock screen including a
pattern base unlock a combination of
face and voice unlock and more 17 unlike
the iPhone 5s the galaxy s4 has more
keyboard options that you can download
so you can find a keyboard that's just
right for you with different styles and
input methods available like gesture
typing you may be noticing a trend here
and reason number 18 only adds to that
with the s4 having more homescreen
options don't like the way the
homescreen looks just download a new one
and swap it out in a couple of seconds
19 speaking of home screens on the
galaxy s4 you can completely hide or
otherwise disable apps that you don't
want or use that are pre-loaded onto the
phone reason number 20 the galaxy s4 you
can add widgets right onto your home
screen so you can get the information
you need right then and there without
having to open a full-blown app 21 at
the top of the s4 you have an infrared
blaster which allows you to use the
phone as a remote control for your TV
cable box blu-ray player and even your
sound system 22 a small but useful
feature on the s4 is t9 dialing which
lets you spell a contacts name on the
dialpad to quickly call them instead of
having to search for their contact
within the address book 23 with iOS 7
the multitasking on the iPhone 5s has
drastically improved but it's still no
match for the multitasking power on the
galaxy s4 with options like multi-screen
which allows you to use two apps at once
on the screen simultaneously 24 unlike
the iPhone 5s you can easily connect an
xbox controller to the galaxy s4 with an
OTG cable so you can play games as if
the phone was its own little console
alright we're finally there
reason number 25 in the past the iPhone
was always known as the easier phone to
use but with easy mode on the Galaxy s4
with its super simplified UI in large
fonts the s4 is a phone that someone
switching from a basic phone will most
likely find it easier to use okay there
you have it those are my top 25 reasons
what the galaxy s4 is better than the
iPhone 5s have reasons that you think I
missed let me know down in the comments
below like I said in the beginning the
iPhone 5s version of this very same
video is just around the corner so make
sure you subscribe for that and as
always thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
