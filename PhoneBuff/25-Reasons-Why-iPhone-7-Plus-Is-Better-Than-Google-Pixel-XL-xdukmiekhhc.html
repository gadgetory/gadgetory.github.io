7 plus and the Google pixel Excel are
easily two of the best smartphones out
right now
so in this two-part Bumble style video
series we're gonna be looking at a bunch
of reasons why each phone could be
considered better than the other but
before we get into it I want to give a
big shout out to graphics dot-com for
sponsoring today's video
so graphics talk has the largest
unlimited download library of graphics
photos vectors and images on the
internet with over three hundred
thousand-plus to choose from now most
websites charge you per graphics so if
you want to use their images and
commercial projects it will cost you as
much as thirty dollars per image so as
you can imagine things can get really
expensive really quickly when you're
designing your websites running a blog
or a YouTube channel or you're making do
yourself or art projects that you might
want to sell but with graphic stock you
get unlimited downloads for just one
annual fee and all memberships come with
a 100% royalty-free agreement now it's
usually priced at $99 a year but for
this holiday season graphic stock is
offering an exclusive $50 discount so
click on the link down below in the
description to get $50 off your annual
membership or go to graphics dot-com
slash holidays alright let's get right
into it
reason number one ip67 water and dust
resistance with the iPhone 7 plus you
don't have to worry about accidental
spills and can even clean your phone
after using it with dirty hands but it
goes beyond just the accidental spill
really changing the way you use the
phone and letting you do things that you
couldn't do before like taking it into
the shower with you to listen to music
to design the old metal back on the
iPhone 7 plus is not only less
susceptible to damage than the half
glass back on the pixel but it's also a
heck of a lot less of a fingerprint
magnet 3 touch ID the iPhones
fingerprint scanner is supported by more
third-party apps allowing you to use it
for security more often than you can on
the pixel on top of that the scanner is
on the front of the device instead of on
the back letting you unlock the phone
while it's lying flat on the table
without having to pick it up every time
like you do on the pixel for vibrate
switch this allows you to easily put the
phone on vibrate but maybe more
importantly it also acts as a visual cue
to save you from accidental rings reason
number five do
speakers having two speakers instead of
only one with one speaker at the bottom
and one at the top the iPhone 7 plus
offers both louder and fuller audio
making watching videos or listening to
music that much better 6 parental
controls better parental controls with
restrictions allow you to block content
and actions through a password-protected
setting meaning you can make sure your
kid isn't visiting any web sites they
shouldn't be and even have the option to
prevent them from erasing browser
history so you can monitor their
activity 7 family sharing you can share
apps and purchases with up to 6 people
and your family which can offer you a
pretty significant savings on music and
apps 8 better apps the App Store the
iPhone often gets new apps first by
weeks or even months gets updates for
apps first and sometimes even gets
better versions of the same apps as many
developers make development for iOS
their priority 9 text-to-speech you can
have selected text right back to you out
loud pretty much anywhere you can
actually select text which is nice when
you want to read something that is
really long without having to look at
the screen like for example when you're
cooking or even when you're driving
reason number 10 dual cameras so I'm not
gonna lie both phones have great cameras
but the difference is the iPhone 7 plus
has two of those great cameras instead
of only one with the second camera
equipped with a telephoto lens allowing
for a 2 X optical zoom meaning you can
zoom in up to two times without losing
any quality 11 bluetooth battery
indicator with supported accessories you
can see the battery level of a connected
Bluetooth accessory and the status bar
which can let you know when it's time
for a charge 12 higher storage model
available so neither of these phones
have expandable SD slots so if you're a
heavy-duty user that likes to keep a lot
of photos music apps and games on your
phone the iPhone 7 plus may be a better
option as there's an available 256
gigabyte option compared to the max 128
found on the pixel 13 iMessage iMessage
not only lets you send messages with
read and received indicators but it also
has expressive messages where you can
send a message with bubble effects and
more which can give your messages that
extra oomph they were missing before 14
more accessories available
with the iPhone having a similar design
for the past few years and using the
same lightning port for even longer
there are naturally more compatible
accessories for the iPhone 7 plus
compared to the pixel and it's
relatively new USB type-c charging port
reason number 15 3d touch 3d touch lets
you physically push in on the iPhone
screen with the extra pressure acting as
an alternate input method this allows
you to do things ranging from firing a
gun and a first-person shooter to
opening up app shortcuts for the camera
my personal favorite is the cursor
control you get when you press in on the
keyboard
making editing your text super quick and
easy 16 tap to top you can tap on the
notification bar in any app to
automatically scroll to the top of the
app which can be especially useful when
you scroll really far down a social
media feed 17 Google ecosystem available
so you obviously get apple's apps on the
iPhone but you also get some of the best
apps from Google like Google now hallo
and more whereas on the pixel outside of
Apple music you don't really get any
other Apple apps like iMessage or Siri
so with the iPhone is kind of like
you're getting the best of both worlds
from Apple and Google 18 raised awake
this feature automatically turns the
screen on when you pick up the iPhone so
you can see the time in any missed
notifications quickly without actually
having to unlock the phone 19 better
landscape support whether you're in
messages or in the settings the iPhone 7
plus often offers additional
functionality when the phone is held in
landscape for example in the browser
holding the 7 plus in landscape makes it
easy to switch back and forth between
different tabs like you would on a
desktop computer whereas on the pixel
yet to take the extra step of tapping on
the tab menu first making the browsing
experience on the 7 plus feel more like
you using a little tablet reason number
20 taptic engine the taptic engine on
the iPhone 7 plus allows for a whole new
level of haptic feedback with it being
more responsive and having a much wider
range of frequencies this results in the
interactions with your phone feeling
more real for example when you scroll
through a list it literally feels like
you're turning a padlock is sensation
that the regular vibrations on the pixel
just can't
twenty-one more LTE bands the iPhone 7
Clause has more LTE bands in the pixel
making it a better phone for traveling
internationally as it's more likely to
be fully supported in the country you're
visiting 22 brighter display the display
on the iPhone 7 plus is significantly
brighter than the one on the pixel XL
which should translate into it being a
bit easier to see when outdoors and
under direct sunlight 23 live photos
this feature lets all those photos you
take come back to life with short
three-second video clips making reliving
those moments that much better 24 reach
ability
unlike the pixel XL the iPhone has a
feature that makes using its large 5.5
inch display easier with one hand where
a double top of the home button brings
the top half of the screen down putting
those corner icons easily Within Reach
and finally reason number 25 faster
performance as shown in our foam of
style speed tests the seven-plus is
significantly faster than the pixel XL
offering faster initial load up times
and a better ability to keep apps ready
for you in the background okay so now
that you've heard the reasons why the
iPhone 7 plus can be consider better
click here or in the link down below in
the description to see why the pixel XL
can be considered better and then after
watching both videos let me know which
phone you think has the stronger reasons
or if there were any reasons that matter
to you that didn't make the list let me
know about those too anyways that is it
for me in this video thank you guys for
watching and as always I'll see you in
the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
