and today and we're doing a quick video
comparison on the browsers on the iphone
4s and the Samsung Galaxy Nexus I've
cleared out the history on both the
browsers I've closed out the apps on
both the phones in the background and
they're running on the same Wi-Fi
network so we can get as even as the
test as we could get and we'll go ahead
and load up NFL com for our first test
alright it go at the same time if I can
so it looks like the iphone 4s loaded up
the site a little bit faster alright
we're going to go to the full website
Galaxy Nexus is done and now the iphone
4s finished so looks like God's next is
a little bit faster loading the full
site and we'll go to yahoo com now
hey you go at the same time all right
the I'll load it up around the same time
right there that was kind of tough to
call you be the judge of that one will
go to the desktop versions Galaxy Nexus
looks like it finished first here and
let's go to fumble calm for our last
test
alright it go
alright so the iphone 4s actually
finished first here so kind of mixed
results as you can see honestly they're
they're pretty close I guess it just
depends on the site like the Galaxy
Nexus is loaded nfl.com faster and from
my experience it loads it faster pretty
much every time but other sites is kind
of like up in the air mobile sites seem
to load faster on the iphone 4s so
they're they're really close it's really
tough to call but both are really fast
browsers and they're both really good
browser so that's it for me this is
