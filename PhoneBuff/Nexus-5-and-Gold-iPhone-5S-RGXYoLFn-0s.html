technology and where I get to ask you
guys that's right you sitting down
watching this video a couple of weekly
questions via polls on our Facebook fan
page you can be a part of the polls by
liking us at facebook.com slash palm
Bluff and get your questions answered by
asking us on Twitter at Bombo I'll put
all the links you need down below but
with that said let's go ahead and get
this show started argit asks hey what do
you like more more RAM on the phone or
more cores for example two to three
gigabytes of RAM with a dual-core
processor or one or two gigabytes of RAM
with the quad core well with the ranges
you gave me you actually pitted a pretty
easy choice which would be two gigabytes
ram with a quad-core processor but I'm
pretty sure you're talking about the
lower end of the range so between the
phone with two gigabytes of RAM but a
dual-core processor
versus a phone with a quad-core
processor with just one gigabyte of RAM
my choice would be the phone with more
RAM I said this for a couple of reasons
for one na√≠vi app out there it's gonna
support those extra cores so a lot of
times they won't even be fully utilized
but second and probably more importantly
I feel like the OS which I'm assuming
we're talking about Android here does
much better with multitasking and just
running more smoothly in general when it
has more RAM to work with and this isn't
just my opinion motorola which is owned
by Google kind of surprised everybody
with their flagship smartphone and the
Moto X being shipped with just a
dual-core processor instead of a
quad-core which has kind of becomes a
standard nowadays yet the Moto X still
runs really smoothly despite having less
course so I doubt the same could be said
if it had shipped with just one gigabyte
of RAM instead of two then Dyson asks
who do you think will make the Nexus 5
okay so speaking of Motorola they're one
of the two companies currently being
rumored as a manufacturer of the next
Nexus the other company is LG which
happened to make the last Nexus
smartphone in the Nexus 4 as far as
which company between the two I think
will eventually go on to make the Nexus
5 my money's on LG I don't have any kind
of inside information on
anything but historically speaking Nexus
smartphones have been made by the same
manufacturer for two generations I kind
of go into this in my Nexus evolution
video which if you haven't seen will be
linked down in description below but in
that video I make the argument that the
first Nexus smartphone was actually the
g1 which technically isn't considered
Nexus but it had the same story as any
Nexus we've ever seen in that it was
running a stock version of Android and
maybe more importantly it was designed
with significant input from Google
anyways about a year after the g1 Google
introduced us to the Nexus One or the
first real Nexus what did the Nexus One
have in common with g1 well a lot
actually but the main thing here was
that they were both made by the same
company which was HTC after the Nexus
One came the Nexus s followed by the
Galaxy Nexus a year later and yep you
guessed it both of those phones were
made by the same company which this time
around was Samsung and then you have the
current Nexus in the Nexus 4 made by LG
now I don't know if it's just a
coincidence but I find it really
interesting that LG is one of the two
companies being rumored to make the
Nexus 5 out of all the companies out
there given the pattern that we've seen
so far and that pattern by the way it
doesn't just exist with Nexus
smartphones it's with the Nexus tablets
as well with the first and second
generation Nexus 7 being made by the
same company in ASIS of course this
little theory of mine is just that a
theory but the next Nexus is made by LG
and the Nexus 10 is made by Samsung then
we'll know that there's some kind of
agreement going on where when a
manufacturer signs on the Nexus program
they have two generations of course
right now rumors say that the next tends
to be manufactured by Asus next time
around so we'll have to wait and see
Johnny asks what are your thoughts about
the new iPhone being gold I don't know
honestly if the rumors are true and the
iPhone 5s does come in a gold Berrien I
guess it'd be nice since having more
options is always a good thing but
personally I don't see myself ever
rocking a gold iPhone and asked you guys
on Twitter and most of you said that you
wouldn't either but at the same time I
think Apple could have some success with
it considering that having an iPhone is
almost like a fashion statement for a
lot of people with it being so popular
and showing up in TV shows and movies
and all that stuff so I really don't
know but tell me what you guys think
down in the comments below
bench Atkinson asks where can you get a
lot of
Android figures are talking about these
Android figures or maybe these ones well
you could actually get them in a number
of places but personally I always get
mine on Amazon I'll buy those blind
boxes where you don't know which ones
coming in the mail which is actually
kind of addicting but I'll go ahead and
link it down there in the description
boy yeah I asked the via phone Bob
Collins weekly poll would you want one
big giveaway or multiple small get boys
and right now it's really really close
when I check the poll last night doing a
giveaway with one big prize like a
smartphone or a tablet had the lead and
now doing a giveaway with multiple small
prizes like Google or iTunes gift cards
has lead so I'll leave this poll open
for you guys to keep on voting in so
that way you can decide what the next
phone book giveaway will be like the
link to the poll is down in the
description all right guys that's it for
me in this episode of bumble q and A's
