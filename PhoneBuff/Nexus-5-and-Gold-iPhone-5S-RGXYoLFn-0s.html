phone buff today what's up guys david
here and welcome back to yet another
episode of fun book you neighs the show
we can ask me just about anything one
related or unrelated to mobile
technology and where I get to ask you
guys that's right you sitting down
watching this video a couple of weekly
questions via polls on our Facebook fan
page you can be a part of the polls by
liking us at facebook.com slash film
buff and get your questions answered by
asking us on twitter at phone book i'll
put all the links you need down below
but with that said let's go ahead and
get this show started argit asks hey
what do you like more more RAM on the
phone or more cores for example 2 to 3
gigabytes of RAM with a dual-core
processor or one or two gigabytes of RAM
with the quad core well with the Rangers
you gave me actually pitted a pretty
easy choice which would be two gigabytes
ram with a quad-core processor but I'm
pretty sure you're talking about the
lower end of the range so between the
phone with two gigabytes of RAM but a
dual-core processor versus a phone with
a quad-core processor with just one
gigabyte of RAM my choice would be the
phone with more RAM I said this for a
couple of reasons for one na√≠vi app out
there is gonna support those extra cores
so a lot of times they won't even be
fully utilized but second and probably
more importantly I feel like the OS
which I'm assuming we're talking about
Android here does much better with
multitasking and just running more
smoothly in general when it has more ram
to work with and this isn't just my
opinion motorola which is owned by
google kind of surprise everybody with
their flagship smartphone and the Moto X
being shipped with just a dual-core
processor instead of a quad core which
has kind of become the standard nowadays
yet the Moto X still runs really
smoothly despite having less course so I
doubt the same could be said if it had
shipped with just one gigabyte ram
instead of two then Dyson asks who do
you think will make the Nexus 5 okay so
speaking of Motorola there one of the
two companies currently being rumoured
as a manufacturer of the next Nexus the
other company is LG which happened to
make the last Nexus smartphone in the
nexus 4 as far as which company between
the two I think will eventually go on to
make the Nexus 5 my money's on LG I
don't have any kind of inside
information on
something but historically speaking
nexus smartphones have been made by the
same manufacturer for two generations I
kind of go into this in my Nexus
evolution video which if you haven't
seen will be linked down and description
below but in that video I make the
argument that the first Nexus smartphone
was actually the g1 which technically
isn't considered Nexus but it had the
same story as any nexus we've ever seen
in that it was running a stock version
of Android and maybe more importantly it
was designed with significant input from
google anyways about a year after the g1
google introduced us to the nexus one or
the first real nexus what did the nexus
one have in common with g1 well a lot
actually but the main thing here was
that they were both made by the same
company which was HTC after the nexus
one came the Nexus S followed by the
Galaxy Nexus a year later and yep you
guessed it both of those phones were
made by the same company which this time
around was Samsung and then you have the
current Nexus in the nexus 4 made by LG
now I don't know if it's just a
coincidence but I find it really
interesting that LG is one of the two
companies being rumored to make the
Nexus 5 out of all the companies out
there given the pattern that we've seen
so far and that pattern by the way it
doesn't just exist with nexus
smartphones it's with the nexus tablets
as well with the first and
second-generation Nexus 7 being made by
the same company in ASU's of course this
little theory of mine is just that a
theory but the next Nexus is made by LG
and the Nexus 10 is made by samsung then
we'll know that there's some kind of
agreement going on where when a
manufacturer signs on the next program
they have two generations of course
right now rumors say that the next tends
to be manufactured by asus next time
around so we'll have to wait and see
Johnny asks what are your thoughts about
the new iphone being gold I don't know
honestly if the rumors are true and the
iphone 5s does come in a gold burien i
guess it'd be nice since having more
options is always a good thing but
personally I don't see myself ever
rocking a gold iPhone and asked you guys
on Twitter and most of you said that you
wouldn't either but at the same time I
think Apple could have some success with
it considering that having an iphone is
almost like a fashion statement for a
lot of people with it being so popular
and showing up in TV shows and movies
and all that stuff so I really don't
know but tell me what you guys think
down in the comments below bench acticin
asks where can you get a lot of cool
we'll Android figures are talking about
these android figures or maybe these
ones well you could actually get them a
number of places but personally I always
get mine on Amazon I'll buy those blind
boxes where you don't know which one's
coming in the mail which is actually
kind of addicting but i'll go ahead and
link it down there in the description
boy yeah I asked you via phone book
columns weekly poll would you want one
big giveaway or multiple small get boys
and right now it's really really close
when I check the pole last night doing a
giveaway with one big prize like a
smartphone or a tablet has the lead and
now doing a giveaway with multiple small
prizes like Google or iTunes gift cards
has lead so i'll leave this poll open
for you guys to keep on voting in so
that way you can decide what the next
phone book giveaway will be like the
link to the pole is down in the
description alright guys that's it for
