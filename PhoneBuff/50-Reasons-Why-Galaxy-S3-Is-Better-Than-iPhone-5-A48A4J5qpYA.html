calm and in this video we're gonna be
looking at 50 reasons that's right
50 reasons why the Samsung Galaxy s3 is
better than the iPhone 5 now I'll be the
first to admit not all 50 reasons with
me that must-have killer feature for you
but there's 50 reasons so I'm sure
you're gonna find more than a few that
you really like iOS fans don't worry
I'll be doing a video just like this in
favor the iPhone 5 in the near future so
make sure you subscribe for that but
right now it's the galaxy s3 is time to
shine so with that said let's go ahead
and get right into it
reason number one the galaxy s3 has NFC
capabilities meaning you can easily
share things like your pictures music
videos and apps and a whole bunch more
just by tapping your phones together
number two the s3 has DLNA this
technology allows you to share your
media wirelessly with other DLNA enabled
devices such as TVs computers and even
gaming consoles like the ps3 third
unlike the iPhone 5 the galaxy s3 has a
micro SD card slot letting you expand or
swap out your memory whenever you see
fit
reason number four the galaxy s3 has a
removable battery meaning you can swap
it out whenever you want number five the
s3 has LED notifications that let you
know when you have a new notification
such as the text or an email just by
glancing at it without having to
actually turn the screen on 6 while the
iPhone is finally up this display size
to 4 inches this pales in comparison to
the 4.8 inch display found on the galaxy
s3 speaking of the screen unlike the
iPhone 5 the s3 Super AMOLED display has
a true HD resolution at 720p 8 unlike
the iPhone 5 the galaxy s3 lets you add
all sorts of widgets to your home screen
which are basically apps that run in
your home screen letting you see and
access things right then and there
without having to open anything 9 the
galaxy s3 has live wallpapers which are
animated and interactive backgrounds
reason number 10 sort of like widgets
the s3 has Wireless toggles in its
notification bar making it easy for you
to turn things like Wi-Fi Bluetooth and
GPS on and off 11 unlike the iPhone 5
the galaxy s3 is actually available on
all major carriers 12 unlike the iPhone
5 the gallon
cs3 gives you multiple ways to lock your
phone including patterns base unlock and
the combination of face and voice unlock
reason 13 the galaxy s3s lock screen
lets you unlock straight into whichever
for customizable apps you want 14 the
galaxy s3 has smart stay which uses the
phone's front-facing camera to keep the
screen on when you're looking at it in
other words you won't have to keep
tapping the screen to keep it from
timing out while reading something
because the phone will do that for you
the fifteenth reason why the galaxy s3
is better than the iPhone 5 is palpable
a which lets you continue watching your
videos with picture-in-picture while you
do other things on your phone 16 you can
buy the c-pen made to work specifically
for the samsung galaxy s3 which gives
you much more precise input than your
average iphone capacitive stylus 17 the
galaxy s3s camera has a feature called
best shot which takes multiple pictures
at a time and lets you choose the best
one from the bunch while automatically
deleting the other ones if you want
reason 18 with more and more carriers
doing away with unlimited data the
galaxy s3 has built-in data usage
controls that allow you to set both
warnings and hard limits to make sure
you don't go over you also get a nice
breakdown of which apps are using that
data which can help you reduce
unnecessary data usage 19 just like with
data usage you can get a breakdown of
the battery stats as well which let you
see not only how much battery you've
used but also what's using it up in the
first place
reason number 20 multitasking with the
galaxy s3 you get true multitasking and
not just the pausing of the apps in the
background not just that you also get
snapshots of the app while task
switching instead of just plain old
icons like on the iPhone 5 21 while it
isn't as relevant as it once was having
Adobe Flash within the browser is still
an advantage the galaxy s3 has over the
iPhone 5 giving you a more full web
experience 22 unlike on the iPhone 5 the
galaxy s3 isn't limited to just one app
store you can download other app markets
like Amazon's app store for example to
have on your phone in addition to the
Play Store
giving you more options reason 23 on the
galaxy s3
you can attach just about any type of
file you want to an email like you would
on a computer whereas on the iPhone
you're limited to just pictures and
videos also on the iPhone 5 you're
limited with what apps you can share
things with whereas on the galaxy s3 you
can easily share things with just about
any app you have installed on your phone
ok we're halfway there 25 while the
iPhone 4s had Google Streetview
the iPhone 5 does not and as a result
it's another reason why the galaxy s3 is
better than the iPhone 526 follow
explorers on the s3 you can use the file
explorer that makes it easy for you to
manage what's on your phone letting you
copy paste and delete things in bulk not
to mention the follow structure looks
exactly the same when you connect it to
your computer making it easy to drag and
drop files to and from your computer
effectively letting you use your phone
as a USB flash drive 27 haptic feedback
you can make it so the s3 vibrates when
you touch things on the screen like when
you use the buttons on the keyboard for
example making it feel as if you are
physically touching the keys 28 you can
control a bunch of things with just your
voice on the galaxy s3 like the camera
the alarm and even the music app capture
take it cheese foam buff Android capture
this isn't the same thing as a voice
assistant this is actual real-life voice
controls without ever having to push a
button 29 driving mode one of those
toggles in the notification bar
mentioned earlier is for driving mode
which conveniently reads aloud incoming
messages to help you keep your eyes on
the road reason number 30 browsing
options on the galaxy s3
you can enable desktop mode which makes
websites think you are on a desktop you
can save a page for offline reading and
you can open up incognito tabs if you
want to browse without a trace
31 t9 dialing on the galaxy s3 you can
simply type in a person's name with a
dial pad and it will bring up their
contact making the process of calling
someone that much quicker the 30 second
reason the s3 is better than the iPhone
5 is the ability to wirelessly install
and uninstall applications from
Playstore simply log into the play store
on the computer with the same account on
your phone and you'll be able to
wirelessly manage your device 33 the
galaxy s3 with its Android OS obviously
better app integration for example
Google Voice can be used to make calls
using the device's native phone app on
the s3 whereas on the iPhone 5 you have
to use the Google Voice app itself and
that's just one example out of the
hundreds if not thousands of apps out
there reason number 34 with the power
saving mode the s3 can lower its CPU
clock speed to a more energy-efficient
frequency it can also turn off other
features that may be draining a battery
helping you prolong your battery life
when you need it most
35 unlike on the iPhone 5 if you buy an
app on the galaxy s3 and you change your
mind you can actually get a refund
within 15 minutes 36 on the galaxy s3
you can hide and or disable apps you
don't want on your phone we're not just
talking about third-party apps here
we're talking about just about any
application on the phone so if you
download a third-party calendar for
example you can either hide or outright
disable the stock one so it doesn't get
in your way
37 the galaxy s3 lets you send certain
phone numbers straight to voicemail by
adding them to the reject list making it
a perfect way to avoid someone you'd
rather not talk to 38 direct call when
looking at a contacts card or text
message thread all you have to do is
bring the phone to your ear in order to
call them 39 double tap the top whenever
you're looking at a list on the s3 all
you have to do to scroll to the top is
double tap the top of the phone itself
40 smart alert in addition to LED
notifications you can set the s3 to
vibrate whenever you pick it up if you
have any new notifications 41 tilt to
zoom just in case you don't feel like
using multi-touch you can simply place
your fingers on the screen and tilt the
s3 back and forth in order to zoom in
and out 42 sometimes it can be hard to
move an app shortcut from one home
screen to another so on the s3 you also
have the option of panning while holding
an icon to move it around 43 thermals or
needs if you're listening to music on
the s3 and you wanna quickly meet it you
can simply turn the phone over 40 for
easier screen shots on the s3 all you
have to do to take a screenshot is swipe
your palm across the screen
which is a lot quicker and easier than
holding the power and home buttons on
the iPhone 5 alright we're almost there
the 45th reason the galaxy s3 is better
than the iPhone 5 is third-party
launchers third party launchers let you
customize exactly how your home screen
and app drawer look and can also give
you all sorts of options that you
normally wouldn't get 46 just like
third-party launchers the galaxy s3 can
get third-party lock screens meaning you
can find the one that best matches your
style reason number 47 third-party
keyboards on the galaxy s3 you're not
just stuck with one keyboard whether you
want to use the jellybean keyboard with
this next word prediction or a keyboard
that lets you trace your words there is
most likely something out there that's
just about perfect for you number 48
unlike the iPhone 5 the galaxy s3 uses a
universal microUSB charging port meaning
that it will work with most of your
other devices ranging from smartphones
to tablets and even bluetooths reason
number 49 the Galaxy s3 has USB host
meaning with a simple adapter that cost
less than $10 you can natively connect
USB keyboards mice and wait for it and
xbox360 controller
alright we're finally here the 50th
reason why the galaxy s3 is better than
the iPhone 5 is share shot and buddy
photo share share shot camera mode makes
it so that other phones can see the
pictures you take while you're in that
mode and buddy photo share detects the
faces in the pictures you take and gives
you the option to either email or MMS
that picture to all the people in it
with one single tap okay guys that's it
for me in this video obviously I didn't
go over every single reasons why the
galaxy s3 may be better than the iPhone
5 but hey that's with a common support
