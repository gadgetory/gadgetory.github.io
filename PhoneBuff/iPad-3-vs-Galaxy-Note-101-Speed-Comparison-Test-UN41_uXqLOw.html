calm and in this video we're doing a
speed comparison test between the
Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 here on the
left and the third generation iPad here
on the right I'll start off the speed
comparison test with a boot up test
obviously this doesn't matter all that
much when it comes to tablets because
you know you're not really going to be
turning them on and off all that often
but not only does it help me see you
know which one boots up faster but it
also clears out the RAM in the
background of both devices that way the
other speed tests have a fair comparison
so of course this has the boot up
animation and sound on the iPad you just
get the Apple logo and there you go so
we see the lockscreen first on the iPad
followed by the Galaxy Note 10.1 both of
them are seem to be fully loaded so
you're going to give the win to the iPad
maybe by a second again it was so close
and also that test is kind of irrelevant
as far as you know when it comes to
tablets so that's the result for that
test let's go ahead and go into the test
that we actually care more about which
is the application speed test so I'm
going to run a similar apps on both
devices obviously I'm only going to do
the ones that are by the same developer
there are different OS so they're gonna
be written a little bit differently you
might get different results but
nonetheless it is a reflection of the
experience that you'll get all right so
for our first test will open up Temple
Run at the same time so one two three go
solve the splash screen first on the
iPad and the game seems to be loading up
a little bit faster followed by the
Galaxy Note 10.1 so pretty safe to say
the win here goes to the iPad all right
we'll go ahead and close it out and I'll
open up the next step which is Flixter
so one two three go
content seems to be finished loading a
little bit faster on the Galaxy Note
10.1 than it was on the iPad let's go
ahead and try to open up another movie
so let's do will do premium rush I
should notice is already loaded that
let's do up ParaNorman so one two three
and that's how I actually looked up with
the constant the content actually looked
to load up a little bit faster on the
iPad let's go ahead and try a another
movie we'll do The Expendables 2 so 1 2
3 again the iPad seemed to load up all
the thumbnails like sort of these
pictures a little bit faster we are
seeing a little bit more content though
on the galaxy note so keep that in mind
for that test I mean pretty much when
we're in the applications seemed like
the iPad is faster but opening it up was
a little bit faster on the galaxy note
10.1 let's go ahead and open up Google
Earth so one two three and Google Earth
opened up much faster on the galaxy note
10.1 than it did on the iPad we'll go
ahead and exit out because we don't even
need to see anymore after that result
and let's go ahead and go to Google Maps
so one two three and again seemed to
render a little bit faster on the iPad
of course this is actually looking at a
bigger area so that might be a factor
let's go ahead and try to look up a
certain area actually we'll do we'll
just type in Las Vegas on both alright
wait go at the same time so one two
three and again we see the map a little
bit faster on the iPad this guy's
actually still loading and there you go
so pretty clear result maps is faster on
the iPad obviously I wasn't closing out
the applications here on the Galaxy Note
10.1 so they are running up in the
background using a ram we're on iOS the
applications are pause so what I'm going
to do now is I'm gonna reverse the test
and go in start all over basically with
each application to see how the
multitasking is affected when it comes
to running the same apps so one two
three with Temple Run and was faster in
the iPad this time so even though you
know they handle multitasking a little
bit different it was still faster on the
iPad will open up Flixter one two three
again
seem to load up a little bit faster as
far as response time are they're both
loading up pretty much instantly but the
iPads animation seemed to respond a
little faster we'll go to Google Earth
so one two three and this already has
you know the map we loaded up
like we did earlier so pretty much the
same results for getting one two three
and again so this seems like the iPad
maybe responds a little bit faster not
really sure if it's going to be like
faster as far as real-world performance
there is just the animation for the most
part so anyway let's get down to the
real test which is the browser test
because ultimately this is the one that
really you know test the devices and
this one really shows you as far as
which processor is more powerful so
let's go ahead and load up our first
website which is phonebook I'm just
going to google searches and tap the
Google results at the same time all
right so I have googled phone buff on
both I'll go ahead and try to make this
link as big as I can so that way I don't
mess up so one two three seeing the
content a little bit faster here
actually this loaded up the main part of
the page will see the ads a little bit
faster here and that was really close I
mean pretty much you know this loaded up
one section of the website first and
then this followed with another section
and back and forth you guys can be the
judge that will go ahead and open up an
article we'll do this article right here
in the center so one two three saw the
content first in the iPad saw the
picture first on the Galaxy Note so
again they're really really close I
don't see don't even feel comfortable
calling a clear winner here because I'm
looking at it through my camcorders a
little viewfinder and you know I have to
watch it again and again a video to
really be able to determine the winner
will go to another website hopefully
there'll be some more separation we'll
go to New York Times alright so I
googled New York Times will make it nice
and big here so I could actually tap
them so one two three solve the content
first on the iPad and looks like the
iPad finished up just a little bit
before the Galaxy Note 10.1 let's go
ahead and type on an article so we'll do
this first article so one two three
so we saw we got an advertisement
actually on both and as you can see the
ad opened up a little bit faster see if
we get skip the ad so try to zoom in
here well it looks like I already
skipped on here on both anyway so that
one loaded up pretty much at the same
time so as you as you see the results
are really really close I think it
really depends on what website you go to
so we'll try to go to Engadget next so
one two three go
so again we're seeing the content first
on the iPad some of the ads over here on
the right side ad at the top and it's
done so yeah it finished maybe just a
second maybe half a second faster than
the Galaxy Note pretty much that's been
the theme I mean throughout from the
boot up time from the applications to
the browser for the most part the iPad
just seems a little bit faster not sure
if that's hardware or software related
obviously this guy's a quad-core
processor this guy has the dual-core a5
X I'm just going to do a benchmark so to
see what the benchmark says will do the
browser mark been shrunk on both ISO
just hit run and I'll skip through the
whole process so that way you guys can
just see the final scores
you
all right so both of the devices are
done with the browser mark benchmark go
ahead and show you the score for each so
on the Galaxy Note 10.1 we got one
hundred fifty eight thousand one hundred
and eighty eight so definitely a really
high score on this guy go ahead and show
you the iPad and the iPad scored a 98
thousand three hundred twenty one now
obviously it's a huge difference between
the two devices when it came to real
world test seemed like it didn't make
that much of a difference in fact this
guy's seemed to perform a little bit
faster of course that depends on which
websites you go to you know very may
well be that you know a lot of website
you go to the Galaxy Note 10.1 actually
loads a more faster
honestly when it comes to speed though
between the two I don't say it's pretty
much at I I mean even though technically
you give the edge to the iPad based all
the comparisons that we did earlier in
the video for the most part everything
will just maybe a millisecond behind or
maybe half a second behind on the Galaxy
Note 10.1 and you really have to look at
the other features of device to really
distinguish you know whether or not you
want the Samsung Galaxy Note or if you
want the iPad and depending on the
screen resolution the RAM the future is
exceptional but anyways that's it for me
in this video if you found out 'full

up button it really helps me out a lot
and scrub to the channel thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
