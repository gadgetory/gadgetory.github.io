you by Squarespace click on the link
below and use offer code buff to get 10%
off at checkout what's up guys david
here from buff and the samsung galaxy s5
and the apple iphone 5s are two of the
most popular smartphones out right now
so in this two-part video series we're
gonna be comparing them but we're not
going to be doing your typical
comparison n instead like we've been
doing since all the way back in 2012
we're gonna be doing it in the often
imitated but originally found here foam
buff style where we look at a bunch of
reasons why each of these smartphones
could be considered better than the
other so that way after watching both
videos you'll have a much better idea as
to which phone is the best choice for
you let's go ahead and get right into it
reason number one the galaxy s5 screen
is significantly larger than the iPhone
5s is making everything from watching
your favorite YouTube videos to browsing
the web a bit more enjoyable and easier
on the eyes to the si screen also works
with gloves which can be a big advantage
of you're somebody who lives in a colder
climate 3 another trick the S size
display has up its sleeve is air view
which gives you a preview of what your
finger is hovering over without actually
having to press it making it especially
useful for things like figuring out
who's speed-dials who's in the dialer
for while the photo quality of the
Galaxy S five in the iPhone 5s are
comparable a big advantage the S 5 s
camera has over the iPhones is his
ability to record video in 4k giving you
four times the resolution and sharpness
of the iPhone 5s is 1080p reason number
five while recording video in 4k is
awesome it does create larger video
files so thankfully Samsung equipped the
galaxy s5 with a USB 3.0 port which
allows for faster file transfer to a
computer than the lightning port does on
the iPhone 5s 6 speaking of large files
the Galaxy s5 has a micro SD card slot
allowing you to store up to an
additional 128 gigabytes of 4k video or
just about any other type of media you
want via a relatively inexpensive micro
SD card 7 unlike the iPhone 5s the
Galaxy s5s battery is removable meaning
you can swap it out for a freshly
charged spare or if you can get an
extended
if you so desire eight but there's a
good chance you won't even need to do
that as the Galaxy s5s 2,800 milliamp
battery will keep you going for longer
than these smaller 1440 milliamp battery
found on the iPhone 9 and as if those
two previous points weren't enough if
you really needed to squeeze more life
out of a single charge the galaxy s5
also has an ultra power saving mode that
helps the battery last you for up to an
additional 24 hours on just a 10% charge
reason number 10 the stock keyboard on
the galaxy s5 has a dedicated number row
while also having the option of long
pressing for secondary symbols but if
the stock keyboard isn't for you on the
s5 you have the option to download
third-party keyboards so you will be
stuck with just the keyboard of the
phone came with 11 just like you to
download and install third-party
keyboards on the galaxy s5 you can also
download third-party launchers allowing
you to customize your home screen and
app to look just the way you like it and
not the way some company thinks your
phone should look twelve on the topic of
customization the lock screen and the
galaxy s5 can be customized to with
different unlock effects different
clocks and even a wallpaper that
automatically changes every few hours
showing you different places all over
the world 13 the galaxy s5 has NFC
capabilities meaning you can use your
phone for things like making payments
tapping your phone to another compatible
phone for easy file transfer and maybe
best of all you can use NFC tags to help
automate some of the things that you do
on an everyday basis 14 unlike the
iPhone 5s the galaxy s5 is ip67
certified meaning it's both dust and
water resistant which can potentially
help save your phone from damage due to
the elements reason number 15 with
private mode on the galaxy s5 you can
hide just about any file on your phone
like a picture or video for example with
it only being visible to you when the
password-protected private mode is
enabled 16 if you ever run into trouble
with the s5 you can triple tap the power
button to automatically send a text to
the people on your emergency contact
list with your location a picture from
the front and rear cameras and a short
sound recording so that way the people
who receive the message can get an idea
of where you are in what's actually
17 on the galaxy s5 you can add widgets
to the homescreen so you can get the
information you need right then and
there on your home screen without
actually having to open a full-blown app
18 if you have a missed notification on
the iPhone 5s this is what you see when
the screen is off on the galaxy s5 on
the other hand you get this blinking LED
light letting you know of missed
notifications without having to turn the
screen on in order to check 19 with a
toolbox feature in the galaxy s5 you can
have a persistent floating menu on the
screen wherever you go giving you quick
and easy access to up to five
customizable apps making multitasking
between them a breeze reason number 20
speaking of multitasking on the galaxy
s5 you can take advantage of all that
extra screen real estate with multi
window which lets you use two apps on
the screen at the same time for the
ultimate multitasking experience 21
while the app store on the iPhone 5s has
advantages of its own that you'll hear
about in the other video the Play Store
on the galaxy s5 has the advantage of
offering a 15-minute return policy for
paid apps so that way you won't end up
getting stuck paying for an app that
doesn't really live up to the hype 22
while the iPhone has always been known
as one of the easiest smartphones to use
the Galaxy s5 with easy mode enabled
takes easy to a whole nother level with
a super simplified interface and extra
large text that may be a better choice
for those of us who aren't as tech savvy
23 on the back of the galaxy s5 you have
a built-in heart rate monitor that comes
along with Samsung's s health app where
you can not only measure your heart rate
but also keep track of your diet and
exercise all in one convenient place 24
unlike the iPhone 5s the Galaxy s5 has
an IR blaster which lets you use your
phone as a remote control for things
like your TV sound system blu-ray player
end if compatible even your air
conditioner
reason number 25 when you buy the galaxy
s5 you get over five hundred dollars
worth of freebies or what Samsung likes
to call galaxy gifts which includes
things like 50 gigabytes of Dropbox
three months of LinkedIn premium $15
worth of in-game credits for cut the
rope too and many other freebies and
specials available exclusively to owners
of the galaxy s5 alright that about does
it for the galaxy s bias version of this
video so if you haven't already I'd also
check out the iPhone 5
this version which will be annotated
somewhere here on the screen or link for
