this video I will show you how to make
your Android phone more secure using
androids built-in security settings so
the way you do it is go over to your
settings options and from here scroll
down to where it says security and from
here you can see you have a whole bunch
of options to make your phone a little
bit more secure first of which is the
screen lock obviously you know this
prevents other people from getting into
your phone if they don't know the
password so let's go ahead and set one
really quick let's do a pattern and I
just hit next really quick and I'll draw
a quick pattern hit continue draw a
quick pattern confirm so now basically
it's gonna lock as soon as I lock my
screen I think it said five seconds
homes can wait five seconds all right so
now when I go to unlock my screen tap on
this guy you can see it's asking for a
password can't get into the phone and
let's say press that guy so type in a
password and there you go so that's one
way now you can make the pattern not
visible so that way you know if
somebody's you know over your shoulder
they won't be able to see your password
which is obviously a good idea because
you know if they see it they'll be able
to memorize it pretty easily so that's
another thing I recommend now another
thing you should do is go to your info
and enter your information so tap the
check box and say put your name and
maybe a contact number other than your
phone so if you ever lost your phone and
someone else found it now they won't be
able to get into it but they would be
able to see your information so say for
example I put in my email address or
something like that so some way that
someone could contact me if they found
my phone I could just hit that lets go
back and now if I lock my phone you see
it has my name right here obviously I've
had my email address you know if
somebody found my phone obviously can't
get in because they don't know my
password but they know my email address
and that way they can email me and
contact me to get it back so anyway you
see doesn't show the pattern by the way
anyway we'll go down and same thing with
passwords make it non visible so that
way when you're typing in your passwords
to maybe your bank accounts or email
accounts or whatever it is someone
looking over shoulder won't be able to
tell what you're typing in another thing
is your
unknown sources don't let you know other
applications or applications not from
Google Play to be installed unless
you're sure so I like to leave this guy
unchecked just in case I accidentally
stumble upon something that tries to
install my phone because the ones from
Google Play are going to be more secure
and you know typically they aren't going
to be malicious and other things you
could do is encrypt your phone now this
is if you're looking for like a lot of
protection on your information
encrypting does take a while it says it
could take up to an hour so you actually
have to plug in your phone to the
charger before you could actually do
this basically does encrypts all your
information sets a password so when you
turn on your phone you actually have to
decrypt it every single time it's the
best way to get you know encryption on
your information stop waits your
information is safe but it does take
quite a bit of time so I'm just going to
go ahead and skip that for now and the
last thing I want to show you is the SIM
card lock because this is a GSM phone
you can actually set a lock on the SIM
card itself so someone found your phone
they can't just pull out your SIM card
and use it on another phone but the
reason why I'm not going to do are
demonstrate this right now is because I
don't know the password to my SIM card
because my carrier did put a password
and if I try to guess what it is a
couple of times it's going to lock my
SIM card basically making my SIM card
you know no good and I definitely don't
want that so I wouldn't recommend doing
this unless you know the SIM cards
password or PIN already so that way you
don't have to worry about messing it up
but that's pretty much it for me in this
video um you know these doing a few of
these basic things can make your phone a
lot more secure and a lot less like it
from other people getting into it and
you know taking your information but
that's pretty much it for me in this
video if you found it helpful beats the
like button and scribe and don't forget
a visit from webcam or cell phone news
reviews and how to's thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
