time now right I'm talking back before
the iPhone or Android even existed and
it was for a good reason
HTC was one of the most innovative
companies in the mobile phase and they
actually played a significant role in
shaping what the modern smartphone is
today but unfortunately for HTC the
market share has been plummeting year
after year after year and I don't think
anybody would be surprised if one day
HTC announces hey we're not going to
make smart phones anymore and we're only
going to focus on VR so at least when it
comes to smart phones 2017 really feels
like a make-or-break year for HTC of
course people were saying the same thing
back in 2016 and probably the year
before that
but the smartphone game is more
competitive now than ever so if you're
an HTC fan you're really expecting HTC
to have something special office please
in 2017 and what do we get the first
flash of smart phone of the year from
HTC in the u ultra if you can already
tell how I feel about you ultra let's
just say I'm not a fan that's not to say
that the U ultra is a bat phone it's not
a bad phone but at 750 dollars it's
definitely a bad Buy now I get where HTC
was coming from in pricing this thing
they're using similar specs to the
Google pixel and the LGB 20 so they
probably figured why not price it in
that range
well HTC if you're watching here's why
the U ultra just doesn't have a unique
selling advantage strong enough that
would make someone want to give up 750
dollars for it in 2017 the V 20 by no
means is my favorite smart phone but it
at least has a wide-angle rear camera a
removable battery and a great stack the
pixel isn't the best looking phone out
there but it at least is always the
first to get updated with security
patches and the newest version of
Android and it also has an amazing
camera with no camera hump in sight the
u ultra on the other hand doesn't have
any real advantages outside of the dual
speakers and maybe the selfie cam but
considering that it came out almost six
months after these other two it's simply
not enough to cut it and no I'm not
going to count the gimmicky second
screen as an advantage just like I don't
count it as an advantage of the V 20 now
making your phone better than the v20
and the pixel even though it came out
six months later is one thing okay
but the you electric not only isn't
better than those other two it's
significantly worse the all-metal build
that HTC has been known for is gone and
instead it's been replaced by an all
glass design I'm not going to lie
okay the design does look nice good job
on that HTC but you could have at least
added wireless charging like Samsung and
LG did when baby to switch to glass
whatever okay I get it not everybody
cares about wireless charging that
everybody needs wireless charging but
what about the headphone jack
yes companies like Apple moved away from
it but at least when they did they added
water and dust resistance to their phone
and not even Apple okay not even Apple
had the courage to take away the
headphone jack while also not providing
an adapter in the Box one word courage
the u ultra definitely runs on the
bigger side with really big bezels that
have been okay if it had a battery those
big as the one on the main nine but
instead HTC you put a battery that's no
larger than the one on the galaxy s7 no
not the galaxy s7 edge but the regular
smaller galaxy s7 and don't even get me
started on that camera humph like come
on HTC it's 2017 really and uh laughing
the u ultra should have been faster
right I get that you had to underclock
the processors to make up for the tiny
battery and the gimmicky second screen
I also get that the Snapdragon 835
wasn't available to you at launch but
the u ultra is expensive all right
you're late to the game so why couldn't
there have been six gigabytes of RAM to
make up for the older processor I just
like a lot of you guys I just don't get
what HTC is trying to do with the U
ultra I'm thinking that they're pivoting
like maybe going after the kind of
people who only care about taking
selfies and there's definitely some
evidence to support that strategy
coca-cola had its first major sales bump
in ten years after putting people's
names on their cans but I don't think
even the most self-absorbed people out
there are going to buy the u ultra just
for better selfies and being able to see
the reflection in the back maybe at a
lower price point like Opel bones but at
750 dollars people could just buy an
iPhone which to many counts as a fashion
statement in and of itself now this
doesn't mean I'm giving up on
Yeah right I'm still a fan I'm still
holding out hope a should be already
confirmed that they'll be launching a
new phone with a snapdragon 835 later
this year but if HTC keeps making the
same mistakes time and time again I
think their days in the smartphone game
or unfortunately numbered what mistake
are they making outside of the Oh
known as the you ultra to me it's that
they keep trying to compete with Apple
and Samsung as Apple and Samsung price
points they just don't have the money to
market their phone like Apple and
Samsung do and they don't have the
resources to invest in R&amp;amp;D like Samsung
and Apple do in fact I think the only
companies that even have a shot at
challenging Apple and Samsung at the
high-end or companies like Huawei LG and
maybe Sony as at least those companies
has money coming in from different
profitable divisions and they also have
unique hardware advantages producing
either their own processors their own
screens or their own cameras HTC doesn't
really have any of that so I just don't
see them competing at the high-end price
point and there's nothing wrong with
that a company like oneplus doesn't have
those financial or hardware advantages
either but they've managed to carve out
a nice little niche for themselves
they've got a pretty solid fan base and
I think HTC can do the same I mean
people already or loyal to HTC or were
loyal tation see but in order for HTC to
kind of rebound they're going to have to
give up the battle that they've been
fighting since 2010 when they started
losing the market share to Apple and
Samsung like that market share is not
coming back as you see unless of course
you have something's big up your sleeve
for your next phone which in that case
can I have really access courage anyways
that is it for me in this video let me
know what you guys think down below in
the comments what she Asians you do what
will it take for them to win you back as
a customer out of that thank you guys
for watching and as always I'll see you
in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
