Instagram you're doing a review on the
HTC evo 4g LTE from sprint basically
this guy is sprint's variant of the HTC
One X but of course being an EVO it does
have a few extra features which I'll get
into later on in the video but for now
go ahead and do a quick hardware tour on
the front of device you have this big
display its 4.7 inches going diagonally
it has 1280 by 720 resolutions with an
HD screen giving you a ppi of 312 at the
bottom of the front you have a capacitor
back home and multitask buttons on the
top you have your 1.3 mega so front
facing camera capable of 720p video
capture get your earpiece right over
here at the top of the phone you have
your power button right over there your
secondary microphone and 3.5 millimeter
headset jack on the bottom of the device
you have nothing but your mic main
microphone on the left you have your
micro USB charging port on the right you
have your volume rockers volume up and
down and your dedicated camera button on
the back of the device you have your 8
megapixel camera capable of 1080p video
capture you've got your LED flash got a
kickstand so I'll go ahead and try to
pull this guy out if I can there you go
so you got a kickstand which is unique
to the evo and HTC logo sprint logo got
this matte black look with a shiny at
the top get your speaker grill right
here at the bottom and let's go ahead
and pull this guy off this guy is
removable the phone does have NFC
capability you see it has a whole bunch
of little connections here for the back
cover you've got a mic or microSD slot
that you can actually expand which is
really nice it's right over here i don't
know why i'm pointing fears right over
here also the phone on the inside has a
non-removable 2,000 milliamp battery
underneath the hood the guy has a 1.5
gigahertz Snapdragon s4 dual-core
processor and one gigabyte of RAM so
that's pretty much it for the device
where is the hardware it goes it's about
eight point nine eight millimeters thick
so definitely a thin phone it is pretty
light as well as own
134 grams or four point seven two ounces
so feels really good in the hand pretty
sturdy build quality but let's go ahead
and talk about what I like and dislike
if you guys follow the channel you guys
know in reviews I start with what I
dislike about a phone and I end it with
what I like I like to end on a positive
note I with all my phone so anyway I'm
gonna go ahead and do that and talk
about a couple of things that I wish
were a little bit different on the EVO
4G LTE alright so the first thing that I
dislike about the evo 4g LTE is the
shiny back cover I mean I think a lot of
people actually notice this and dislike
it I know there's a few people out there
who like her a lot of you guys who like
it but I'm not one of them I feel like
this guy picks up a lot of fingerprints
and it just doesn't go with the phone I
mean the whole phone is not black you
know on the front it's all a matte black
on the sides it's matte black of course
you have the silver aluminum outline but
anyway on the back it's matte black over
here and it's that anodized material the
HD uses basically scratch resistant
resistant which is really nice to know
you scratch all you want you see a
little bit of residue but that's really
just your fingernail anyway the back
cover this top part this doesn't go with
it thankfully it is removable so my hope
is that maybe somebody on the you know
third some third-party maker makes a
custom back cover that is matte black
just like the rest of them but
considering that has all these little
connections I see that being a lot
harder than it sounds so we'll see if
that happens if it does I'll be really
happy because it will take away one of
the things I dislike about this phone
making it you know all that much better
I'll try get this guy on correctly the
next thing that dislike about the evo 4g
LTE and this pretty much with all HD
devices is the lock screen button
location they put them at the top of the
device now it's fine for the smaller
devices even on the HTC One S being a
4.3 inch screen this guy's 4.7 inches so
it's definitely a bigger device so I
find it a little bit harder to out you
know reach all the way up here and press
the power button to turn the screen on
on a phone like the galaxy s3 you have
it on the slide which does make it a lot
easier for me also on the galaxy s3 of a
physical home button which brings the
screen on as well over here these guys
are capacitive so obviously it's not
going to do anything unless the screen
is on in the first place so that's
another thing I dislike and the last
thing I dislike is the non removable
back
re you can't pull this guy out I mean if
you run out of juice you're out of juice
you get a charge it up obviously they
have a two thousand million battery
which is actually more than the typical
1x so that's nice to see that HD did
that but at the same time I just wish I
had the option to choose you know as I
see they gave us option issues with that
memory with the expandable memory card
but unfortunate they didn't do the same
with the battery but anyway those are
the things that I dislike I mean
honestly not that long so I just three
things the rest of what I like and we'll
go ahead and talk about some of those
things right now alright so the first of
many things I like honestly I'm not
gonna be able to go through all of them
but the first thing that I like is the
screen on the EVO I mean the screen is
4.7 inches it's an HD screen so it's
1280 by 720 but it's also a super lcd2
screen so you don't have that you know
shared the sub-pixel layout like you
would on the galaxy s3 with the AMOLED
screens it's a lot brighter than you
would expect an ambulance screen and has
a higher PPI 312 so I mean everything
this looks clear I did a screen
comparison on the channel between this
phone and the galaxy s3 if you guys
don't check it out personally I like
this one a little bit more mainly due to
the fact that when I'm out in the Sun I
can see the screen a little bit easier
than I can the galaxy s3 because it is
brighter I don't have to you know try to
cover the glare from the Sun like this
because the screen is bright enough for
me not to have to do that so that's the
first thing that i really like but with
an HD screen like this and also
considering that this is a 4g LTE phone
on the second thing that i like is the
kickstand so obvious is unique to the
evo brand on sprint go ahead and pull
out the kickstand this guy's a little
bit harder to take out than it looks but
kickstand is nice and sturdy and you
know what more would you want then being
able to watch you know HD video or in
this case Googler somehow i managed to
open that on this week is set it down
and look at it that way but that's not
it you could actually flip this guy over
and go the other way if you want a
different slope so if you want a
different angle you get hit like that
this one's a little bit less of a slope
which I you know is obviously a nice
thing to see so you have two different
options kind of with the same kickstand
like I said it's really sturdy put it in
like that and once it's in you don't
even feel it it's like it's not even
there so it is one of those things are
an extra nice extra if you don't like it
guess what you don't have to use it if
you like it then great um I definitely
like it so that's another thing that I
like about the
Evo and another thing that alike is the
camera button it's actually a dedicated
button so normally you have to press you
know the camera but you have to put on
your home screen or app dog in order to
access it and I'd go with you know
pretty much every Android phone i have
they seem to have gotten rid of that but
it's nice to see that HTC came back with
it yeah makes it really easy to take
pictures and launch your camera I will
say that it seems to lag sometimes to
open up the camera from here for example
if I were to close out the camera so i
think i just close it out and press and
hold this guy you see it's lagging a
little yeah okay i'll let go and now it
open so takes a really long time but of
course once it's open it doesn't take
that long well maybe it does so anyway i
don't know why i mean i was obviously
the software issue because if i tap this
guy boom it opens up right away and
that's one of the things I like and
that's one of the things I'll talk about
so now we talked about the data cameras
talk about the camera itself I mean
launches up really quick if you're using
the software button at least I'm sure
you know once they do update it'll fix
that hardware issue as far as it lagging
but one thing with HTC sense is in the
HD image chip is you're able to take a
whole bunch of pictures at one so it's
brush a photo mode by pressing and
holding took a bunch of pictures of my
little android that has his ears chopped
off on furniture unfortunately I could
choose the best shot just like that and
takes absolutely great pictures takes
great video try to the video sample I
did on the channel as well gives you a
better idea as far as the video and
audio quality that you could expect out
of this a megapixel camera on the back
how next thing that I like about Thea
phone is the speed so like I said
earlier it has a 1.5 gigahertz
Snapdragon s4 dual-core processor so
this phone is definitely no slouch it's
really really fascinating which you'd
expect out of any phone with the s4
running Android Ice Cream Sandwich 4.04
so go ahead and show you that right now
since I mentioned it where is the
software information there you go so
it's actually android 4.0 3 i'm sorry so
once it gets the update it will trickle
to 4.0 for or i'm not sure if they'll
just skip it altogether and go to jelly
bean but anyway I really fast experience
I mean the apps pretty much open as soon
as you tap on them so definitely
something that I really enjoy in here I
did a side-by-side comparison as far as
the speed goes with the galaxy s3
galaxy s we did edge it out a little bit
consider he does have an extra gigabyte
of RAM the scale has one galaxy s3 s2
but I mean really we're talking the
difference of milliseconds so it's not
that big of a deal and honestly it's
like comparing a Lamborghini and a
Ferrari if I had to say one which one is
what I say this one's a Ferrari just
because it's black and red and those are
Ferrari colors but anyway you're going
to get a really fast performing device I
absolutely love the performance that
appeared match that with the screen the
dedicated camera button and the little
kickstand you have a great entertainment
device in the uniform EVO 4G LTE and you
know like the name implies as 4G LTE
which makes screaming all your online
content really really nice in here but
um that's pretty much you know all I
want to say I mean I do like the micro
expandable SD card slot which is nice
because a lot of phones are seem to be
dishing those at least the last recent
HTC phones have been doing so so as I
see that especially you know since I
consider that entertainment device
really you want to have a big memory
card so you can store all your movies
and shows and whatnot and music on here
obviously has Beats Audio beats by dre
by dr. dre which is nice you have HD
voice capabilities which is you know one
of the first phones with HD Voice on
sprint's network like I said it has NFC
so it comes pre-loaded with Google
Wallet see if i could find that so tap
on this guy and bluetooth 4.0 and stuff
like that so I mean you got everything
you know we thought you'd expect out of
a high-end phone on here overall I mean
I i do recommend this phone I love it
it's really close between this in the
galaxy s3 I mean if you want you know
certain things you might go for the
galaxy s3 if you want you know more
about entertainment device i'd recommend
the evo 4g LTE because that kickstand in
combination with the you know i think
it's a better screen as far as in the
brightness and clarity and dedicated
camera button you can't really go wrong
with the evo 4g LTE so you really put
aside what you like but if you go over
things that you know I that I pointed
out as far as disliking it then this is
definitely a device reap anyway that's
it for me in this video if you found it
helpful please hit the like button and
subscribe like i said i'll be doing a
lot more videos i'll be doing a in-depth
review of the touch or I'm sorry the HTC
Sense UI so that way you guys can get a
better ideas for us you know what to
expect from since if you haven't
the before but anyway thank you for
