of me doing a review on the HTC EVO 4G
LTE from Sprint basically this guy is
Sprint's variant of the HTC One X but of
course being an Evo it does have a few
extra features which I'll get into later
on in the video but for now let's go
ahead and do a quick hardware tour on
the front of the device you have this
big display it's 4.7 inches going
diagonally it has 1280 by 720 resolution
so it's an HD screen giving you a PPI of
312 at the bottom of the front you have
a capacitive back home and multitasking
buttons on the top you have your 1.3
megaphone facing camera capable of 720p
video capture got your earpiece right
over here at the top of the phone you
have your power button right over there
your secondary microphone and 3.5
millimeter headset jack on the bottom of
the device you have nothing but your mic
main microphone on the left you have
your micro USB charging port on the
right you have your volume rockers
volume up and down and your dedicated
camera button on the back of the device
you have your 8 megapixel camera capable
of 1080p video capture
you've got your LED flash got a
kickstand so I'll go ahead and try to
pull this guy out if I can there you go
so you got a kickstand which is unique
to the Evo and HTC logo sprint logo got
this matte black look with the shiny at
the top got your speaker grill right
here at the bottom and let's go ahead
and pull this guy off this guy is
removable the phone does have NFC
capability you see it has a whole bunch
of little connections here for the back
cover you've got a mic or micro SD slot
that you can actually expand which is
really nice it's right over here I don't
know why I'm pointing clear it's right
over here also the phone on the inside
has a non-removable 2000 milliamp
battery underneath the hood the guy has
a 1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon s4 dual-core
processor and one gigabyte of RAM so
that's pretty much it for the device
where's the hardware goes it's about 8.9
8 millimeters thick so definitely a thin
phone it is pretty light as well it was
134 grams or 4.7 2 ounces so feels
really good in the hand pretty sturdy
build quality but let's go ahead and
talk about what I like and dislike if
you guys follow the channel you guys
know in reviews I start with what I
dislike about a phone and I end it with
what I like I like to end on a positive
note with all my phone so anyway I'm
gonna go ahead and do that and talk
about a couple of things that I wish
were a little bit different on the Evo
4G LTE alright so the first thing that I
dislike about the Evo 4G LTE is the
shiny back cover I mean I think a lot of
people will actually notice this and
dislike it I know there's a few people
out there who like her a lot of you guys
who like it but I'm not one of them I
feel like this guy picks up a lot of
finger prints and it just doesn't go
with the phone I mean the whole phone is
matte black you know on the front it's
all a matte black on the sides it's
matte black of course you have the
silver aluminum outline but anyway on
the back it's matte black over here and
it's that anodized material that HTC
uses basically scratch resistant
resistant which is really nice you know
you scratch all you want you see a
little bit of residue but that's really
just your fingernail anyway the back
cover this top part this doesn't go with
it thankfully it is removable so my hope
is that maybe somebody on the you know
third some third party maker makes a
custom back cover that is matte black
just like the rest of them but
considering that has all these little
connections I see that being a lot
harder than it sounds so we'll see if
that happens if it does I'll be really
happy because it'll take away one of the
things I dislike about this phone making
it you know all that much better try it
get this guy on correctly the next thing
that dislike about the Evo 4G LTE and
this pretty much with all HD devices is
the lock screen but in location they put
them at the top of the device now it's
fine for the smaller devices even on the
HTC One S being a 4.3 inch screen this
guy's 4.7 inches so it's definitely a
bigger device so I find it a little bit
harder to out you know reach all the way
up here and press the power button to
turn the screen on on a phone like the
galaxy s3 you have it on the slide which
does make it a lot easier for me also on
the galaxy s3 have a physical home
button which brings the screen on as
well over here these guys are capacitive
so obviously it's not going to do
anything unless the screen is on in the
first place so that's another thing I
dislike and the last thing I dislike is
the non removable
we you can't pull this guy out I mean if
you run out of juice you're out of juice
you gotta charge it up obviously they
have a two thousand million battery
which is actually more than the typical
1x so that's nice to see that HTC did
that but at the same time I just wish I
had the option to choose you know as I
see they gave us option issues with that
memory with the expandable memory card
but unfortunate they didn't do the same
with the battery but anyway those are
the things that are disliked I mean
honestly not that long Sony just three
things the rest of the one I like and
we'll go ahead and talk about some of
those things right now all right so the
first of many things I like honestly I'm
not gonna be able to go through all of
them but the first thing that I like is
the screen on the Evo I mean the screen
is 4.7 inches it's an HD screen so it's
1280 by 720 but it's also a super LCD to
screen so you don't have that you know
shared the sub pixel layout like you
would on the galaxy s3 with the AMOLED
screens it's a lot brighter than you
would expect an AMOLED screen and has a
higher ppi 312 so I mean everything this
looks clear I did a screen comparison on
the channel between this phone and the
galaxy s3 if you guys want to check it
out
personally I like this one a little bit
more mainly just the fact that when I'm
out in the Sun I can see the screen a
little bit easier than I can the galaxy
s3 because it is brighter I don't have
to you know try to cover the glare from
the Sun like this because the screens
bright enough for me not to have to do
that so that's the first thing that I
really like but with an HD screen like
this and also considering that this is a
4G LTE phone
the second thing that I like is the
kickstand so obviously unique to the Evo
brand on Sprint go ahead and pull out
the kickstand this guys a little bit
harder to take out than it looks but
kickstand is nice and sturdy and you
know what more would you want then being
able to watch you know HD video or in
this case Google or somehow I managed to
open that on this week is set it down
and look at it that way but that's not
it you could actually flip this guy over
and go the other way if you want a
different slope so if you want a
different angle you get hit like that
this one's a little bit less of a slope
which you know is obviously a nice thing
to see so you have two different options
kind of with the same kickstand like I
said it's really sturdy put it in like
that and then once it's in you don't
even feel it it's like it's not even
there so this is one of those things are
an extra nice extra if you don't like it
guess what you don't have to use it if
you like it then great I definitely like
it so that's another thing that I like
about the
evo and another thing that alike is the
camera button it's actually a dedicated
button so normally you have to press you
know the camera button you have to put
on your home screen or app dock in order
to access it and I do it with you know
pretty much every and refer when I have
they seem to have gotten rid of that but
it's nicely that HTC came back with it
yeah makes it really easy to take
pictures and launch your camera I will
say that it seems to lag sometimes to
open up the camera from here for example
if I were to close out the camera so I
think I just close it out and press and
hold this guy you can see it's lagging a
little yeah okay I let go and now it
opens so takes a really long time but of
course once it's open it doesn't take
that long well maybe it does so anyway I
don't know why I mean that's obviously
the software issue because if I tap this
guy boom it opens it right away and
that's one of the things I like and
that's one of the things I'll talk about
so now we talked about the cameras talk
about the camera itself I mean launches
up really quick if you're using the
software but at least and I'm sure you
know once they do update it'll fix that
hardware issue as far as it lagging but
one thing with HTC Sense is in the HD
image chip is you're able to take a
whole bunch of pictures at once so it's
brush photo mode by pressing and holding
took a bunch of pictures of my little
Android that has his ears chopped off on
furniture unfortunately I could choose
the best shot just like that and takes
absolutely great pictures takes great
video check out the video sample I did
on the channel as well gives you a
better idea as far as the video and
audio quality that you can expect out of
this a megapixel camera on the back next
thing that I like about Thea phone is
the speed so like I said earlier it has
a 1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon s4 dual-core
processor so this phone is definitely no
slouch it's really really fast in which
you'd expect out of any phone with the
s4 running Android Ice Cream Sandwich
4.04 so gonna show you that right now
since I mentioned it where is the
software information there you go
so I stacked Android 4.0 3 I'm sorry so
once it gets the update it or trade go
to 4.04 or i'm not sure if they'll just
skip it altogether and go to jelly bean
but anyway really fast experience I mean
the apps
pretty much open as soon as you tap on
them so definitely something that I
really enjoy in here I did a
side-by-side comparison as far as the
speed goes with the GOG
three galaxies we did edge it out a
little bit consider he does have an
extra gigabyte of RAM the scale has one
galaxy s3s too but I mean really we're
talking the difference of milliseconds
so it's not that big of a deal and
honestly it's like comparing a
Lamborghini and a Ferrari if I had to
say one which one is what I say this
one's a Ferrari just because it's black
and red and those are Ferrari colors but
anyway you're gonna get a really fast
performing device I absolutely love the
performance that appeared it's match
that with the screen the dedicated
camera button and the little kickstand
you have a great entertainment device in
the unifor Evo 4G LTE and you know like
the name implies it as 4G LTE which
makes streaming all your online content
really really nice on here
but um that's pretty much you know all
want to stay I mean I do like the micro
expandable SD card slot which is nice
because a lot of phones are seem to be
dishing those at least the last recent
HTC phones have been doing so so it's
nice to see that especially you know
since I consider that entertainment
device really you want to have a big
memory card so you can store all your
movies and shows and whatnot and music
on here obviously has Beats Audio beats
by dre by dr. dre which is nice you have
HD voice capabilities which is you know
one of the first phones with HD voice on
Sprint's Network like I said it has NFC
so it comes pre-loaded with Google
Wallet see if I could find that so tap
on this guy and Bluetooth 4.0 and stuff
like that so I mean you've got
everything you know we thought you'd
expect out of a high-end phone on here
overall I mean III do recommend this
phone I love it it's really close
between this and the galaxy s3 I mean if
you want you know certain things you
might go for the galaxy s3 if you want
you know more of an entertainment device
I'd recommend the EO 4G LTE because that
kickstand in combination with the you
know I think it's a better screen as far
as you know the brightness and clarity
and dedicated camera button you can't
really go wrong with the Evo 4G LTE so
you really put decide what you like but
if you over the things that you know I
that I pointed out as far as disliking
it then this is definitely a device Reap
anyway that's it for me in this video if
you found it helpful please hit the like
button and subscribe like I said I'll be
doing a lot more videos I'll be doing a
in-depth review of the touch or I'm
sorry the HTC Sense UI so that way you
guys can get a better ideas for us you
know what to expect from since if you
haven't
before anyway thank you for watching the
