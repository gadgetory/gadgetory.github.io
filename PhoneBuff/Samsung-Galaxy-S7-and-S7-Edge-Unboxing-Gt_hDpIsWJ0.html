than most holidays the galaxy s7 is out
and in our studio we've got the black
onyx and silver titanium models from
AT&amp;amp;T and since the packaging is
identical on both phones we'll take a
look at just one of the boxes any meenie
miney mo will go with you black a7 so
first thing I've got to say is thank you
AT&amp;amp;T for not messing up the packaging on
the s7 s like you did with the note 5 as
that packaging was damn ugly
first thing you were greeted with is the
phone itself we'll go ahead and put that
to the side as well as the QuickStart
guide inside of this little black box we
have the SIM tool to access the new
hybrid micro SD slots as well as a
health and safety guide that almost
nobody ever reads but that's not what
you're here for let's get to the meat of
the video we have your typical Samsung
fast charging power brick a 4-foot micro
USB cable and what's new for this year a
micro USB 2 standard USB adapter so
you'll be able to easily plug in a
keyboard a mouse or a flash drive to the
phone and for those of you who wanted
the new USB type-c port instead of micro
USB just to be able to charge another
device with your phone you can actually
do that here with this adapter so that
is actually pretty damn cool you also
get this little hard plastic carrying
case for the earbuds and it's nice
because you can actually reuse it unlike
Apple's ear pod case which can really be
a pain to try to reuse the earbuds look
pretty nice and come with an extra pair
of rubber covers so you can swap the old
ones out when they get all gross and
waxy finally last but not least you've
got the phone itself and while not a
whole lot looks to have changed in terms
of design at first glance it really
didn't need to then us seven looks
amazing and it's got all the right
curves in all the right places
I can't wait to test anything out we've
got a bunch of coverage coming up soon
so make sure they enable those channel
notifications so you don't miss out but
anyways that is it for me in this video
give it a big thumbs up if you liked it
and as always I'll see you in the very
next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
