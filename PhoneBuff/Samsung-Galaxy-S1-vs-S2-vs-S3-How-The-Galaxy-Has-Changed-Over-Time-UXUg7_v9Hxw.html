and this we don't want to talk about how
the Galaxy S lineup has changed over the
years starting with the original Galaxy
S 2 the galaxy s 2 and now that the
galaxy s 3 just want to talk about the
hardware a little and also the software
so on the left with the Galaxy S the
original actually the t-mobile variant
the US version it has a 4-inch screen
going diagonally it was 800 by 480 and
resolution Super AMOLED of course you
have the four capacitive touch buttons
at the bottom and on the back you have a
five major so camera this particular
variant then I have a front facing
camera but for the ones that did it was
a VGA camera galaxy s2 in this case
Sprint's Epic 4G Touch variant had a
bigger screen as you can see it's a
noticeably bigger at 4.5 inches some
variants were 4.3 inches but this guy
was 800 by 480 so the same resolution
but the difference was this guy is Super
AMOLED plus so the sub pixel layout is a
little bit different they weren't shared
sub pixels giving you a little bit
better quality than you get over here
and you can see you have the same 4
capacitive touch buttons as you did on
the original Galaxy s4 the US version
again the international version had a
physical home button with the up
capacitive buttons on the sides and the
back has a 8 megapixel camera and on the
front you actually have a 2 megapixel
front facing shooter on this guy so
pretty impressive
you know improvement from the original
and then now we have the galaxy s3 which
are obviously hung up from the screen
Department just keeps getting bigger and
bigger this is a four point eight inch
display but the difference between the
this and the last two is the resolution
has finally been kicked up to 1280 by
720
now the screen type is Super AMOLED like
it is on the original galaxy s so it's
not super amoled plus but you know with
the higher resolution it really does
make up for that shared sub pixel layout
so definitely obviously the better
screen is on the galaxy s3 now what's
interesting is on the US versions on the
bottom you have only two capacitive
touch buttons kind of like the
international versions work for the s-1
and s2 with the physical home button
here at the center and on the back you
have an 8 megapixel camera similar to
the one found on the galaxy
- so not that big of a increase or
improvement from the galaxy's tube on
the front the front facing camera is 1.9
megapixels basically around the same as
it was on the galaxy s2 again obviously
the quality difference can be a little
bit different because there are
different lenses but as far as the
megapixel count they're pretty much the
same let's go ahead and compare the
phone side-by-side you can see all three
had the power button at the right
obviously the spacing is a little bit
different but for the most part you know
close to the right thumb so you could
turn on the screen easily at the top all
three of them had the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack over here on the Galaxy S
one air and s2 galaxy s3 they flipped it
over to this side the charging port is
actually at the top for the s1 where on
the s2 and s3 there at the bottom and on
the left side you have the volume rocker
for all three versions and you can see
the thickness you know pretty much it's
gotten thinner over the years there
wasn't dramatic dramatic difference
between the s1 to s2
however the s3 is noticeably thinner
than both of these guys and obviously
you know with it being this much bigger
that's a definitely good thing because
it doesn't make it much more pocketable
so that's the you know outside look at
it on the inside you had a 1 gigahertz
processor on the original Galaxy S and
this is for an international version and
you know the wording that came in the
States it was a 1 gig of processor it's
a hummingbird processor on the s2 yet a
little bit of differences now the
international version had the akeno's
1.2 gigahertz processor which actually
the sprint version did as well but some
US variants had the qualcomm snapdragon
s3 processor clocked a little bit higher
at 1.5 gigahertz so that's the
difference there the s3 has all US
version had the Qualcomm Snapdragon s4
processor at 1.5 gigahertz but the
international version had a the akeno's
processor like this guy but it was a
quad-core obviously at 1.4 gigahertz so
a little bit you know slower frequency
but of course you have four cords major
difference between the Galaxy s3 in the
US and the international version is this
guy has 2 gigabytes of RAM this guy's 1
gigabyte of RAM and this guy only has
512 so basically if you think about it
as far as the US versions the ram has
doubled every single time with every new
galaxy s so pretty impressive me really
think what you're doubling the RAM every
single time and the processors you know
not necessarily doubled from here to
here it was doubled but from here to
here wasn't really double but definitely
dramatic increase our improvement on the
s3 you know I do like a lot and
considering it is pushing a high
resolution resolution screen definitely
needed that processing power but anyways
that's pretty much it for the hardware
it's going to talk about software see
how TouchWiz has actually changed
TouchWiz on the original galaxy as you
know it's very simple you had the a
black background over here scroll to the
right and I left once you scroll it to
the right you're pretty much stuck and
you have three apps right here that you
can customize got the notification bar
just for little toggles that you could
turn on and off and just all grey
notification shade so that's pretty much
it when you press many you had you know
these typical little options and go into
settings and looks like this so that's
the way the TouchWiz looked on the
Galaxy S the original on the galaxy s2
TouchWiz looks a little bit different
the background is now clear so you could
actually scroll through your apps and
not have to look at a back background
they also got rid of the little the
application used to have a little square
border around them like over here all
little apps had square boards they get
rid of them over here which I definitely
prefer because it looks a lot cleaner
and now you have the scrolling motion
which could scroll like that I'm not
sure if this one had it yeah I don't
think it did but so yeah that scrolling
motion with TouchWiz 4.0 now when you
press many obviously without having Ice
Cream Sandwich it looks like this
instead of the little six icons over
here so it definitely looks a lot
cleaner the notification bar looks a
little bit better you have more toggles
now you have five toggles instead of
just four like you did over here and you
know makes it a little bit easier to
access what you're looking for and on
the s3 you know it's probably mine
obviously my favorite version of
TouchWiz now on the app dock you have
four apps that are customizable versus
three and that's thanks to the high
resolution screen the notification bar
you've got not only do you have five
toggles right here but you know you
could actually scroll over you have an
extra four so you have nine total
toggles that you can turn on and off
much more control at your hands you
as a setting button here to go straight
to the settings course as an ICS type
option the app drawer looks pretty much
the same it is see-through but now it's
you can scroll all the way through
instead of getting stuck at the end
widgets are available right here as well
so you know it follows kind of the theme
of Ice Cream Sandwich but with Samsung's
TouchWiz touch on top of it so that's
pretty much how it looks you know things
here obviously there's a lot of changes
you know that happened in the software
versions over here just basic software
you have the introduced motion controls
on the galaxy s2 and that they took it
to the next level with the galaxy s3
with features like smart stay where the
camcorder are the camera on the front
detect your eyes to see you know what am
I looking at to determine whether or not
to turn off the screen
um and a whole bunch of other features
but anyway just wanted to do a quick you
know talk about I mean you know it's
really nice to be able to look back at
technology to see how it's progressed
over time kind of gives the ideas for us
I know it's kind of early but what the
you know next Galaxy S will look like
the s4 you know what kind of pot will
probably have see a quad-core processor
for sure and that you know who knows how
much RAM they'll put in what kind of
screens we'll see but anyway so when it
is quick video for all you you know
Android fans like me all you Galaxy S
fans like me I'm you know I've owned
every single one of them since they've
come out and definitely I love them and
you know definitely of the improvements
feel like Samsung really you know is the
flagship manufacturer for Android
because not only they make the Nexus
phones but their Galaxy S lineup is the
best selling Android phones out so
anyway that's it for me in this video if
you found it you know helpful or if you
liked it hit the thumbs up button and
