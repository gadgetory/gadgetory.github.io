in this video we're doing a benchmarking
of the samsung galaxy note 2 i'm really
excited to benchmark this guy because
you know the international version of
the galaxy s3 had the icky nose for quad
processor at one point 4 gigahertz and
the US version had a snapdragon but i
had to key west ram this one has the
best of both worlds as the enkei nose
for quad and also it has to give us ram
but not just that thanking us for quad
is clocked at one point six gears so
it's even faster so with that said let's
go ahead and benchmark it before I go
ahead and do that though when I quickly
show you that it has 1.75 gigabytes of
RAM available which is a big improvement
over the samsung galaxy s3 so let's go
ahead and run the antutu benchmark first
I'll just kind of run the benchmark and
skip through the whole process so you
get to see the end result all right so
I'll go ahead and go to the test tab and
hit start test and like i said i'll go
ahead and skip through this whole
process and show you the end score
I so the benchmark score is done and
scored a thirteen thousand six hundred
and forty let's go ahead and go on to
the next test which is going to be
quadrant and we'll hit run full
benchmark
alright so the quadrant benchmark is
done and it scored a 6564 let's go ahead
and go on to the next benchmark which is
going to be Alamo and we'll go ahead and
just run all chapters
you
also the Vilano benchmark is done on
html5 is scored 1791 and on metal scored
629 we'll go ahead and hit yes compared
with other devices and you see is scored
pretty much at the top underneath it is
the HTC One X everything else is below
it you can see the galaxy s3 over here
definitely blew the galaxy s3 out of the
water in this test let's go ahead and
look at the metal test and again at the
top with the HTC One X being right below
it so let's go ahead and go on to the
next benchmark which is going to be CF
bench and we'll just hit run full
benchmark and skip to the results
alright so CF bench is done and let's go
ahead and see the score we got so you
can see you got 26,000 7514 915 so
that's actually higher than the galaxy
note 10.1 tablet so really really
impressive there and last been drunk
will do is nano mark this one pretty
much locks it at 60 so we'll see if it
reaches that
alright so we got 57.7 frames per second
pretty much you know at that that
maximum as far as what it's locked at 60
frames per second but overall really
really impressive benchmarks you know a
pretty much performed exactly how I
thought it was going to and it's nice to
say that because a lot of times you know
you'll see a highly suspect device but
yet it doesn't perform up to what you
think this one actually does real world
performance has been the same everything
flies on here with Android jelly bean
and the process around here is super
fast the RAM helps multitasking awesome
awesome device definitely the fastest
android phone I've ever used that's
pretty much it for me in this video if
