buff and in this video we're going to be
comparing the Snapdragon s4 pro to the
Snapdragon 600 now we're not really
looking to see which one is faster here
as being the newer trip from Qualcomm we
fully expect the Snapdragon 600 to
outperform its predecessor but what I
really want to show you guys is how much
of a difference there actually is
between the two using a real-world test
that isn't dependent on synthetic
benchmarks or isn't heavily dependent on
software optimizations because the Nexus
4 that represents the s4 pro here is
running on pure Android 4.2 while the
HTC One with the Snapdragon 600 is
actually running on a modified version
of Android with HTC Sense 5 over top of
Android 4.1 so the first thing we'll do
here is turn both devices on to make
sure all the background apps are closed
out making this test as fair as possible
don't really mind the results of the
boot up as the HTC does have fastboot
enabled which makes it boot up a bit
faster than the wood with fastboot
turned off now before we begin the test
I want to let you know that the
Snapdragon s4 pro is a quad core chip
clocked at 1.5 gigahertz while the
Snapdragon 600 found in the HTC One is
also a quad core but it's clocked at 1.7
gears all right so with that out of the
way let's go ahead and begin the test
which will be transcoding the same video
file on both phones at the same time to
see which phone and its respective
processor finishes the task first
basically what's going on here is the
phones are compressing the video file
down to a smaller size which is actually
something that a lot of people use on
their Android phones considering that
you can email files larger than 25
megabytes
therefore transcoding a video file is
indeed a real-world task and the
processor you have under the hood can
make a big difference and how long you
end up waiting to do this okay so this
is actually a pretty big file with
transcoding here at 332 megabytes so
I'll go ahead and fast forward the video
until one of the processors is almost
done alright so as you can see here the
Snapdragon 600 packing HTC One finished
transcoding the video while the s4 pro
inside the Nexus 4 was about 70 percent
done making the Snapdragon 600 at 1.7
gigahertz about 30 percent faster than
the s4 pro at least when it comes to
this
memory intensive tasks now really quick
I want to show you guys that software
still does play a big role in the
perceived speed by doing a quick browser
test so I'll load up Bombo com on both
phones using Chrome and as you can see
they both load it up at about the same
time loading up the verge even seem to
be a little bit faster on the nexus 4
which I'm willing to bet was a result of
the enhancements made with Android 4.2
compared to the Sense 5 version of
Android on the HTC one loading up an app
gave similar results with again the
Nexus 4 and it's technically weaker
processor actually loading things up a
little bit faster so answering the
question in a title of the video yes
there is a significant difference
between the Snapdragon s4 pro and the
Snapdragon 600 as you'd expect there to
be and as there should be but it'll
probably only be noticeable to you when
you're doing tasks that aren't
necessarily heavily dependent upon
software alright guys that is pretty
much it for me in this video if you
liked it please give it a thumbs up and
