and today i'm doing a video on how to
turn on your data network what happens
to a lot of people is they'll be using
their phone they could call they could
text but they can't access facebook they
can browse the internet and they can't
send emails in other words they can't or
they're not connected to their data
network show you what that looks like at
the very top of the status bar you can
see there's no icon next to the signal
bars there's no e or 3G or 4G or
whatever it may be for your phone that
basically is telling you that there's
your phone is not connected to the data
network so there's two ways to turn it
on and it depends on the model of your
phone but at least one of these methods
should be available so you're going to
hit menu from the home screen and hit
settings and then let me zoom in you can
go to wireless and network and from here
you're going to scroll down and find
mobile networks so mobile networks right
there go ahead and click on that and you
can see use packet data isn't activated
so I'm just going to go ahead and check
that it says do you want to do that
whatever okay and see the top bar you
see my little H popped up so I'm
connected to the data network now
another way to do that if this option
isn't available and it's kind of similar
with a lot of things or a lot of systems
items in Android is it's not available
there you know press and hold the power
key from the home screen or actually
doesn't really matter where you do it
from and you can see right there it says
data network mode so right now it says
it's activated I'm just going to turn it
off so you get to see you do you could
toggle it on and off right from there
too that's actually easy easier way to
get to it you can see now I have no data
so that's basically I do it or you could
use a trick to let someone borrow your
phone and don't let them go through your
Facebook turn off data network I won't
know how to turn on alright that's it
for me this is david bohm Volcom thank
you for watching the video and don't
forget to visit for more calm for more
