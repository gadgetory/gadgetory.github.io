have a foam bob style drop test with the
all new Google pixel two XL where we're
gonna be dropping it side by side next
to the iPhone AIDS plus to see which
phone is most durable but before we get
into it I want to give a big thanks to
tech 21 for sponsoring today's episode
so when we tested tech 21 Evo check case
for the pixel 2 XL the case handled the
back corner and face drops like it was
nothing TAC 21 protects the drop after
drop with the pixel we tested still
being in perfect condition this is
thanks to a scientifically proven
material with a three layer protection
system that spreads out and absorbs the
impact energy preventing it from passing
on to your device you can pick up the
Evo check case at your local verizon
store or by using the links down below
in the description so check it out and
get your phone the protection it
deserves alright let's get to the drop
test round number one backdrop in three
two one
so both screens are still fully
functional after that backdrop but the
difference is the iPhones rear glass
gets shattered while the pixel to glass
remains fully intact
the only real damage to the pixel are
actually just a few small scratches on
the aluminum at the bottom but compared
to the iPhone AIDS results the pixel
easily gets the win in round number one
round number two corner drop in a three
to one
oh all right so both phones get dinged
up after that corner drop but the damage
does look a little bit worse on the
pixel with the pixel scuffs running a
little bit deeper giving the slight edge
to the iPhone in round number two round
number three base drop and three two one
oh my gosh okay after that phase drop
both won't suffer similar damage along
the bottom but where they differ is up
top where the pixels front glass just
looks horrible I mean the iPhone screen
got shattered too but on the pixel there
are literally chunks of glass missing
from the top and all that cracked glass
up top unfortunately also distorts the
selfie cam so it's an ugly win for the
iPhone in round number three bonus round
all right so while neither phone looks
great they're both still technically
fully functional so they both move on to
the bonus round where they'll be dropped
from much higher up directly onto steel
really put in the shock and impact
resistance of each phone to the test
last time the iPhone eight plus was able
to withstand eight additional bonus
drops before it finally gave outs with
this inner LCD being severely damaged
and not really responding to the touch
while its rear camera and flash
completely failed so let's see if the
pixel two can do any better and three
two one
glass flying around everywhere but
phones still working so like we there's
pretty much no glass left at the top
that is nuts 3 2 1 geez 3 2 1 oh man oh
man so now at this point we have three
little dimples in the screen we have
almost no glass left at the top and does
it work oh if I wanted dial nine-one-one
I get dial 1 1 but I can't no matter
what I do
dial 9 so at this point I'm gonna have
to cut it off so this guy's out so after
5 drops we had to throw in the towel the
pixel twos inner display has a few dead
spots and unfortunately it doesn't
respond to the touch on the entire top
half of the screen nor does the response
hit anything along the bottom right
making the phone pretty much unusable
and up the damage to the top of the
phone only got worse in the bonus round
with so much glass missing from the
front that you can actually see some of
the components underneath so not a
pretty result all right with 4 rounds in
the books let's take a look at the score
card in the first round the pixel two
just dominated the iPhone sustaining
almost no damage to the back the second
round was much closer with the iPhone
just barely squeaking past the pixel in
the third round the pixel made the
iPhones shattered screen seem somewhat
acceptable and finally in the fourth the
iPhone was able to outlast the pixel by
three additional drops however in the
end it was the first round with the
iPhone shattered and the pixels didn't
that made all the difference along the
pixel to just barely get the win here in
the drop test anyways that is it for me
in this video thank you guys for
watching and as always I'll see you in
the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
