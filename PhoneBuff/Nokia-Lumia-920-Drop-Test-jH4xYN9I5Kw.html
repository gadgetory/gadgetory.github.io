and in this video we're gonna be doing a
drop test on the Nokia Lumia 920 to see
how tough and how durable this phone is
we're doing a traditional drop test
meaning we're going to drop it from the
hip we're gonna drop it from the chest
height and then of course going to drop
it from the head height to see you know
if it's going to be able to survive all
those drops so with that said let's go
ahead and start with the first set which
is going to be the hip test alright so
we'll put this thing in my pocket and
basically pretend as if I'm pulling out
my pocket and I'm gonna drop it on
accident so let's go ahead and start it
so one two three alright so let's take a
look at the damage you can see that the
touch screen is still working so that's
definitely good pretty much everything
on the front looks like it did before
because it landed mostly on the back so
let's take a look at the back side and a
little bit of scuff marks right here
along the top not sure if that's coming
through on camera and then on the bottom
left is where it's at the majority of
the damage which was right over here you
can see definitely started ripping away
a little bit at the phone itself but
other than that everything looks pretty
darn good so let's go ahead and take it
to the mid height test
alright so the Nokia Lumia 920 survived
the hip drop test let's go ahead and
take it to the next level which is going
to be the mid height drop test but
instead of me actually doing the drop
test I'm having a little nephew come in
drop because honestly I don't really
drop my phones all that often but he
definitely does so let's go ahead and
bring him in alright here he is and this
guy is definitely going to drop this
phone I'm sure a lot of you guys can
relate to this so we're going to handle
the phone and see how long it takes form
to actually drop it and then see the
damage on it all right so let's go ahead
and hand over the Nokia Lumia 920 to a
baby and let them do their magic
so see how long it takes him to actually
drop this thing take a job in no we
don't eat it we drop it you like that
one down much you want to drop it
alright so we'll just go ahead and skip
until he actually drops it because it
might be a while seems like he likes the
phone and there you go we finally got
her to drop that was really hard to
actually shoot because we have no idea
when this guy decides to drop it but
just go ahead and take a look at the
damage slow and it seems like the
Boyce's is actually talking alright so
let's go ahead and take a look at the
damage looks like the screen is still
working perfectly fine fact the whole
front plate looks like it was undamaged
at all let's look at the back and the
tops pretty much the same I mean a
little light scuff right there at the
top right that wasn't there before on
the top left is from the previous drop
test of course in the bottom left we had
the damage but this time we do have some
damage along the bottom right side so a
little bit more of the same this one
actually fared a little better than the
initial drop test which is quite
surprising probably the angle that it
fell on but pretty good go ahead and
take it to the next level which is going
to be the pretty much head height drop
test
I saw the Nokia Lumia 920 has done
really really good so far let's go ahead
and put it through its final test which
is up here from the head I don't know
how it's going to do let's go ahead and
find out so say you're on a phone call
and all of a sudden whoops whoops whoops
now that sounded pretty bad so let's go
ahead and check out the damage all right
so let's check out the results
so you can see the touch screen is still
working on the front we'll look at the
edges so top left and top right look
fine bottom left and bottom right look
fine as well so the front plate in
general didn't take any damage from
these drop tests that we did let's look
at the back and you can see pretty much
nothing we have the little light scuff
marks here at the top that you could
barely even see on the bottom of course
the original drop test we did right here
second drop test right here and along
the left edge is where the third drop
test did it damage I mean
a really loud sound but it seems to be
pretty good I mean yeah some light scuff
marks and considering does the white one
actually shows up so if you were to get
the black Lumia 920 I imagine that it
wouldn't show up as bad but that's
pretty much you know the damage or the
third job test and really impressive all
right so that's the drop test for the
Nokia Lumia 920 honestly really really
impressed with the results I mean the
phone looks pretty much on damage some
scratches obviously but it's still in
working condition if you found the video
helpful you know if you liked it
everything he did a good job please give
it a thumbs up and also if you haven't
already subscribe to the channel and
looks like you want to do a second drop
test but we'll save that for another
video thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
