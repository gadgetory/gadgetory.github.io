quick video I'm gonna show you one of
the easiest ways to factory unlock the
samsung galaxy s7 which will allow you
to use it with any GSM carrier or SIM
card anywhere around the world now right
up front I want to let you guys know
that this method isn't free but then
again the money you could save on
roaming charges when you travel and the
resale value unlocking your phone
actually adds to the phone could make it
well worth the cost so the process
itself is dead simple first thing you're
going to want to do is find your phone's
IMEI number which can be done by opening
up the dialer hitting star hash zero six
hash which will open up a prompt with
the phone's IMEI the next step is to get
the unique unlock code your phone needs
from an unlocking service our partners
and trusted sources unlock rivers so
we'll be using them here where you
simply select the carrier your phone is
locked to which in my case is AT&amp;amp;T in
the United States under manufacturer
you're obviously going to want to select
Samsung and then under model find the
galaxy s7 from this huge list of Samsung
phones you can unlock where at least for
AT&amp;amp;T there are two versions of unlocks
you can choose from one is a standard 3d
six-day delivery while the other is an
express delivery for those of you who
need to get unlocked as soon as possible
note that the cost of unlocking varies
from carrier to carrier and the standard
or express options may not always be
available next enter in that IMEI number
that we got earlier making sure to type
it in exactly as it appeared on your
phone otherwise this whole process won't
work and then finally type in a valid
email address where you want the unlock
code to be sent after that just hit
unlock and within the quoted timeframe
after purchasing you'll get an email
that looks something like this giving
you that unlock code that you need once
you have it turn off the Galaxy a7
insert any non-accepted sim card into
your phone so in my case since this is
an 18 t galaxy s7 I'll put in a Vodafone
sim and then power the phone back on
when they
phone is done booting up you'll get a
message saying invalid sim as you kind
of expect and all you have to do at this
point is unlock the phone and it'll
literally ask you for an unlock code
just enter in the unlock code that was
sent to you via email and voila your
Galaxy s7 is now factory unlocked easy
right alright guys that is it for me in
this video thank you for watching it as
always I'll see you in the very next
episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
