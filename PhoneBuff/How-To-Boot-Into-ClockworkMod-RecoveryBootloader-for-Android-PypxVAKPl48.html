today I'm gonna show you how to boot
into bootloader on your Android phone so
while booting into bootloader comes in
handy for a lot of reasons one because
it lets you flash custom roms and
kernels if your rooted and another one
is it helps bypass sometimes if your
phone is stuck on a certain screen it
helps to restart so for example I've
seen a lot of times where people's
phones get stuck in this screen or the
animation screen and no matter what they
do they can't get to put up the
operating system so one way around it is
to go into bootloader and restart from
there so of course I can't replicate you
know make my phone frozen on the screen
well this is assume it is and no matter
what I do is stay stuck on the screen
what you're going to do is plop the
battery from the back and you turn the
phone off and you pop the battery right
back in and what you're going to do to
go into bootloader is you're going to
hold the volume up and volume down key
simultaneously along with the power key
until the phone turns on so I'll go
ahead and do that so I'm holding the
both the volume up and down at the same
time then I'll press power hold it for a
few seconds bone turns on and you can
see I'm in bootloader so I could
navigate by pressing volume up and down
and I can restart the phone by hitting
start right here and I press the power
key and you see the phone's going to
restart and a lot of times this will
help get you past being stuck on this
screen alright that's it for me in this
video this is Dave from 4.com thank you
