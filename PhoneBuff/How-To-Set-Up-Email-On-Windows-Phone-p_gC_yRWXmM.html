this video i'm going to show you how to
add an email account on your Windows
Phone so from your home screen scroll
over to your main apps list and go to
settings from here you're gonna look for
email and accounts just like over here
tap on it and then hit add an account at
the top and from here you can choose
what can account you want to add so in
this case I'll just add a yahoo you
account and I'll enter in my email
address up here and my password down
here off screen and that will get back
to the steps as soon as I'm done alright
so I finished up typing in my email your
password as you can see I'm just going
to hit sign in here at the very bottom
and there you go the accounts been added
so you can see right here says it's
adding it there you go and I could
rename the account right here if I
wanted to I could also change how often
it downloads the new emails over here so
obviously the shorter the amount of time
the more battery life you can always so
if it checks it every 15 minutes you're
gonna waste more battery to check it
every 30 minutes it'll be less so I'll
just put on an hour because that seems
fine for me you could also choose how
long you want or how far back you want
it to download email from I just hit it
set it as the last seven days of course
you get changed your name and some other
settings if it's not working correctly
but pretty much for the most part that's
all you need to do hit the check mark
right here at the bottom and you're done
alright that's pretty much it for me in
this video if you found it helpful hit
the like button and scribe and don't
forget to visit Bombo calm or cell phone
use reviews and how to's thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
