phonebook calm and in this video we'll
show you how to configure the universal
search feature on your Android phone so
as you can see I have my search widget
right here at the top of my screen and
to actually configure what is searches
through so basically instead of having
to search just the web and the default
applications a searches I could actually
decide which one to search by tapping on
the text field hitting menu and then
tapping on settings after he hit
settings go to searchable items and then
you can check or uncheck the apps that
you want the universal search to search
through so for example my apps are
checked meaning that when I search for
up app I have installed on my phone
it'll find it I can have it searched
through my browser industry but I don't
really want that I have it checked to
search through my color note which is my
note application my messaging is checked
so that way if I'm looking for a
specific text message somebody sent me
like you know when to meet them up or an
address
I could actually search for that which
makes a lot easier instead of scrolling
through the eyes my people is actually
unchecked right now I'm just gonna go
ahead and check it and then place row
I'll leave checked and play a probe my
music app I'll leave tracks so now I'll
go ahead and show you how to actually
use it so for example let's say I'm
looking for a song I just type in let's
say headlines is a song that I have my
phone and so these are actually the
words are the songs that all have the
word head in it so I've been L there you
go so now you see headlines there I just
tap on it and it's gonna start playing
the song I can go home and search for
something else so let's say I'm
certainly for a particular app this is I
just say I want Chrome so I guess that
CH or you see Chrome comes up right away
so pretty cool feature I mean that and
it works through contacts that you see
my contacts are actually showing up out
here anyway and let's say they don't
want my contacts I just go right back
go to settings go to searchable items
and take people off and now when I go
back you can see that it won't actually
search through that so pretty cool
functionality if you wanted to clear
your history as you can see I have a
history right here I can just go same
thing go to settings go to Google search
and then just tap clear on device search
history tap on that guy hit clear
history and I'll go
back go back and you can see there's no
history there but that's pretty much it
