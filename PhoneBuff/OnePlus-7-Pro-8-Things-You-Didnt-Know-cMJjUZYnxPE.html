the information that even one plus was
putting out bit by bits you probably
know a good amount already about the 1
plus 7 Pro you know that it has a new
higher resolution notch list 90 Hertz
display you know it has dual stereo
speakers a triple camera system and
improved vibration motor and that it's
one of the first Android phones to
support faster ufs 3.0 storage but in
today's video I want to talk about some
of the things that maybe you don't
already know about the phone some of
them big things and some of them just
small little quirks so we'll start off
with that pop-up selfie cam now if
you're like me you might be worried
about having a moving part in your phone
and it's durability but oneplus says
that they tested the pop-up camera over
300,000 times and they've actually built
a fair amount of software into the phone
to help protect it so if you switch back
and forth between the cameras like a
madman over and over and I did this just
because it looked cool you get a little
warning telling you to essentially take
it easy if you try closing it by
manually stuffing the camera back inside
with your finger it automatically
retracts and warns you not to do that
and if you try to open the camera while
something is blocking it it'll make this
weird sound for a while and then it just
gives up letting you know that it's
blocked
but maybe the coolest thing about the
selfie cam software is its fall
detection so if the camera is open and
you accidentally dropped the phone it'll
automatically retract which is pretty
good especially when you consider that
you know the selfie cam when it's popped
up you can even have a case on the phone
it's gonna be exposed so it's good that
it goes back in and stays fully
protected now the second thing that you
may not know about the oneplus 7 Pro has
to do with the camera as well this time
the cameras on the back of the phone and
it is actually a bit of bad news and
that's the fact that you can't record
video using the wide-angle camera you
can obviously take photos with all three
lenses but when it comes to video at
least for now it's limited to just the
main lens and the telephoto lens so if
you're thinking about using this thing
like a little GoPro yeah that's not
gonna happen
the third thing that you may not know
over the phone is a small one
in the new sim tray compared to the
oneplus 60 before it this new sim tray
is tiny it still dual SIM the tray has a
saw on each side of the phone for a
different SIM card and from the looks of
it it seems like there's a larger seal
around the tray for water resistance I
know that one post didn't have this
phone officially IP rated but this at
least is a good sign so the fourth thing
that you may not know about the oneplus
7 pro is that while it has the same USB
C port as the 60 in terms of raw data
transfer speed dois +7 is way faster
with USB 3.1 compared to USB 2.0 on the
60 alright
the fifth thing that you may not know is
a new software feature that won't plus
implemented into the 7 pro called the
Zen mode enabling this mode basically
disables your phone for 20 minutes at a
time so you can focus on whatever it is
that you're doing without your phone
distracting you now while this may sound
a lot like screen time or like digital
well being it's not because you
literally can't disable it once it's
started there's no home button there's
no back button you can press and you
know I thought for sure that if I
restarted the phone it would go back to
normal but nope it still doesn't work so
I like it I mean when you turn on Zen
mode it's a real commitment not to use
your phone letting you have date night
or whatever it is and allowing you to
reclaim some of your attention at least
for 20 minutes without any temptation at
all ok the sixth thing that you may not
know about the oneplus 7 pro is its
fingerprint scanner is a lot better than
it was before on the 16 not just because
of the 3 element lens and the larger
sensor compared to that phone but also
because of the new algorithms that do an
even better job of learning your
fingerprints so it works faster and more
accurately now usually you can't really
show the progress these types of
algorithms make on a phone but with the
fingerprint scanner you actually can so
here I registered a fresh scan of my
finger and while it works when I use it
just right when I turn my finger over to
the edge it doesn't work no matter how
many times I try but as I unlock the
phone successfully with that finger over
and over the phones algorithm learns
more about my finger and slowly but
surely starts adding it to the database
eventually
getting to the point where that seemed
sideways unlock that I was trying it
earlier works nearly every time this
means that you don't go into the
settings and register that same finger
multiple times in an attempt to improve
accuracy at first the fingerprint
scanner is not gonna be that great but
the more you use it the better it gets
I literally hated the fingerprint
scanner when I first started using this
phone but now that I've used it for a
while now that I've trained it it's
improved to the point where it's no
longer an issue it actually works pretty
damn well and you know while still
preferred the old style of fingerprint
scanner like the one on the pixel the
scanner is no longer a deal breaker for
me moving on the seventh thing they may
not know has to do with those curved
edges on the phone no there's no edge
panel like on the Galaxy phones and no
I'm not the biggest fan of curved edge
displays but oneplus did add a nice
little animation when you receive a
notification it's a small little quirk
for sure but it's something that does
add a bit of value when phone is just
sitting off to the side and you get a
notification and finally the eighth
thing that you may not know about the
oneplus 7 pro is it has a new cooling
system that oneplus is calling ten layer
liquid cooling which is supposed to keep
the phone running strong even after long
gaming sessions now from my experience
with the phone with the dual speakers
and the 90 Hertz display the phone
definitely still gets hot but more
importantly it hasn't led to the
processor overheating to the point where
there's thermal throttling
of course we'll learn a lot more about
the phone's performance once we do our
speed test but that's pretty much it for
me in this video I do have my review of
the phone coming soon along with the
speed test and the battery test wants
the phone's become publicly available so
subscribe if you don't want to miss out
on those hit that thumbs up button if
you liked the video I was trying to give
you guys some different covers compared
to what you're probably seeing in your
feed thumbs down if you didn't like the
video it still helps me get better and
uh I'll see you in the very next episode
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
