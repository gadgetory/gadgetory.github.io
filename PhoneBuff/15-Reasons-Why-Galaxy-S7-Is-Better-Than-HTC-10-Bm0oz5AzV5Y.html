looking for a new Android phone odds are
that the galaxy s7 and HTC ten have
crossed your mind
so in this two-part bump of style video
series we're going to be looking at 15
reasons why each phone can be considered
better than the other let's go ahead and
get right into it
reason number one wireless charging
built-in wireless charging allows you to
charge the phone on any charging pad
whether you're at home or at a coffee
shop to ip68 water and dust resistance
the s7 won't get damaged from accidental
spills this also allows for easier
cleaning after using the phone with
dirty hands three quick launch camera
from any screen on or off you can
quickly launch the camera with a double
tap of the home button so you never miss
a photo for microUSB charging port
unlike the HTC tens USB type-c port the
SMN comes with the long time standard
micro USB input which means less new
cables you'll end up having to buy
number five one-handed operation triple
pressing the home button shrinks the
screen making it a lot easier to use
with one hand six multi window multitask
run two apps on the screen at the same
time taking full advantage of the large
5.1 inch display seven Samsung pay this
works almost anywhere like a normal
credit card compared to Android pay
which only works at terminals with NFC
technology eight heart rate sensor using
the sensor you can easily track your
heart rate with the included s health
app 9 included OTG adapter with the
included adapter you can easily connect
USB peripherals to the phone like a
keyboard mouse or flash drive number 10
always-on display
this feature shows the time and date
when the screen is off for quick
information at a glance 11 private mode
this allows you to hide sensitive files
like pictures or videos which are only
accessible to you by fingerprint or
password 12 SOS messages triple pressing
the power button can send a quick alert
to emergency contacts including your GPS
location a photo from the front and rear
cameras along with a short audio
recording 13 smart stay this feature
uses the front facing camera to prevent
the phone's display from turning off
while you're looking at it
14 smart alert if you have an unread
message the SN will vibrate when you
pick it up letting you know about it
without having to look at the screen
reason number 15 game tools from locking
the capacitive buttons to blocking
alerts while you're playing this feature
takes gaming on the s7 to the next level
alright so those are the top 15 reasons
why the galaxy s7 can be considered
better than the HTC 10 now the word
better is subjective so be sure to watch
the HTC 10s version which will be
annotated somewhere on the screen and
linked for you down below in the
