6 and the galaxy s5 are obviously two
the most popular smartphones out right
now so in this two-part video series
we're gonna be comparing the two but
we're not going to be doing your typical
comparison and instead we're gonna be
doing your foam lifestyle where we do
two videos looking at a bunch of reasons
why each smartphone could be considered
better than the other so that way after
watching both videos you'll get a much
better idea as to which phone is
actually the better smartphone for you
let's go ahead and get right into it
reason number one the iPhone 6 with its
anodized aluminum body curved edges in
sapphire crystal home button has what
most people would consider to be a much
more premium look and feel to it than
the more plasticky galaxy s5 - in
addition to the build quality the iPhone
6 is also smaller thinner and lighter
than the galaxy s5 making it easier to
hold in the hand 3 while this advantage
is becoming less and less of a selling
point for iOS the fact still remains
that right now the iPhone still has a
better selection of apps with more iOS
first and iOS exclusive apps available
then the Play Store does on the galaxy
s5 for speaking of apps like you'd
expect on the galaxy s5 you can't get
any of Apple's apps like Siri iMessage
or FaceTime but on the iPhone not only
do you get all of Apple's apps you also
get a good chunk of Google's with apps
like Google now hangouts and more all
available for free on the App Store so
you kind of get the best of both worlds
reason number 5 but there are some apps
that you don't get on the iPhone 6 and
those are those annoying and uninstall
about pre-loaded carrier apps that
plagued some of the versions of the
galaxy s5 6 under the privacy settings
of the iPhone 6 you can see what an app
has access to on your phone and if you
don't feel comfortable with something
the app has access to you can just
switch it off without having to delete
the app completely like you would on the
galaxy s5 7 on the iPhone 6 you can tap
the notification bar while in any app to
automatically scroll to the top which
can be especially useful for when the
lists get really long 8 the Lightning
port on the iPhone 6 is reversible so
you can plug it in to charge and either
direction
making connecting it at night when the
lights are off so much easier on the
iPhone 6 than it is on the galaxy s5 9
when you want to email a large video
file on the galaxy s5 you're met with
this error message with no suggestive
solution whereas on the iPhone 6 sending
that same video file results in the
iPhone automatically compressing the
video and sending it seamlessly reason
number 10 while both the iPhone 6 and
the galaxy s5 have fingerprint scanners
the one on the iPhone is compatible with
more third party apps and is also much
more convenient to use as you don't have
to swipe your finger across it making
things like unlocking your phone a lot
quicker 11 with guided access you can
lock the iPhone 6 on any app that you
want so you can hand your phone off to
your kid and let them play with the
phone without having to worry about them
getting into anything else 12
unlike the galaxy s5 when you connect a
Bluetooth accessory to the iPhone 6 you
get an icon in the notification bar
indicating the battery level of the
connected accessory 13 historically
speaking iPhones have had better resale
values than the galaxy asses so in a
year or two there's a good chance that
you'll get more money back for the
iPhone 6 than you would for the galaxy
s5 14 from pretty much anywhere you can
copy-and-paste
on the iPhone 6 you have the option to
have selected text read back to outloud
ideal for long articles or when you
can't look away from what you're
currently doing reason number 15 because
the iPhone 6 gets us update straight
from Apple you'll be updated to the
latest version of iOS just about right
after Apple releases it whereas on the
galaxy s5 it could take anywhere between
a few weeks to several months before you
get an update after it's been released
16 on the back of the iPhone 6 you'll
find two LED lights that together give
you better and more natural-looking
light when taking photos than the single
led found on the galaxy s5 17 speaking
of taking photos the iPhone 6 is per
shot is faster and lasts for much longer
than the Galaxy s5s
all but guaranteeing you that you'll
capture that Kodak moment 18 but
sometimes those Kodak moments are better
off being captured in slow motion and
with the iPhone 6 not only do you get
720p 240 FPS slow motion video
you also get audio to go along with that
making reliving those moments even more
epic 19 of course in this day and age
the front cameras and our phones are
becoming just as important as the rear
cameras and thankfully the iPhone 6 is
FaceTime camera doesn't disappoint
offering better image quality than the
Galaxy s5s
while also supporting birdshot to help
ensure you get that perfect selfie
reason number 20 as we saw in the film
of style speed test we conducted the
iPhone 6 with its custom a a chip
outperforms the galaxy s5 giving you a
smoother and more responsive experience
overall 21 the dedicated vibrate switch
on the iPhone 6 lets you conveniently
silence the phone without having to turn
the screen on the switch also acts as a
visual indicator so you can tell if the
phone is silenced or not with a quick
glance which can help prevent those
awkward situations where your phone
rings when you don't want it to 22 the
iPhone 6 is speaker offers both louder
and better quality sound than the
speaker found on the galaxy s5 making
listening the music and maybe more
importantly watching videos a bit more
enjoyable 23 while the ability to make
mobile payments via NFC is something
that now the iPhone 6 and galaxy s5 can
both do with Apple pay the iPhone 6 also
gives you the ability to shop online via
apps of the browser and make payments
with nothing more than your fingerprint
24 the iPhone 6 supports up to 20 LTE
bands doubling the LTE support bound on
the galaxy s5 and making it a much
better option for staying connected
while traveling abroad
alright we're finally here reason number
25 with family sharing on the iPhone 6
you can share your purchases from iTunes
iBooks in the App Store with up to 6
people and your family without having to
use the same accounts or passwords
offering a significant savings advantage
that isn't available on the galaxy s5
alright that about does it for the
iPhone 6s version of this video so if
you haven't already I'd also check out
the galaxy s5 version which will be
annotated somewhere here on the screen
or link for you down below in the
description anyways that's it for me in
this video if you liked it please give
it a big thumbs up to show you love and
as always I'll see you guys in the very
next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
