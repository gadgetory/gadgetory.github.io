bluff calm and in this video we're doing
a speed press test between the Apple
iPhone 5 here on the left and the
samsung galaxy note 2 here on the right
to see which phone is faster between the
two well go ahead and start off with a
boot up test so I'll go ahead and power
on each device and let them load up
their respective voices which by the way
is Android 4.1.1 jelly bean on the
Galaxy Note 2 and iOS 6 on the iPhone 5
both devices are connected to the same
Wi-Fi network and the browsing history
and cache have been wiped so it's gonna
be nice and even as far as those tests
go we have the Apple a6 dual-core
processor running on the iPhone 5 and
the quad core Exynos 4 quad processor at
1.6 gigahertz on the galaxy note 2 so
from the boot up sense we can see that
the iPhone 5 did seem to load up a
little bit faster maybe a couple of
seconds and we'll let these guys finish
loading up everything while they're
loading up I'll let you guys know that
you know the a speed test obviously
they're gonna be written differently as
far as the apps go but they aren't the
same apps written by the same developer
so it's as close as we get it so with
that said let's go ahead and start so
first I will run is calculator and that
was really close to mean pretty much a
draw only difference there is probably
the transition animation so I'm just
gonna call that one a draw we'll go
ahead and hit home and go on to the next
step which is gonna be YouTube tap them
at the same time and see which one
actually shows us the content first
because you know when it comes to apps
you want to see the content first or
faster and this case it was faster on
the Galaxy Note 2 then it was on the
iPhone 5 maybe by a second or two I will
go ahead and go to the next app which is
gonna be Google Earth so tap those guys
at the same time and again a little bit
faster on the Galaxy Note 2 in this case
so so far the Galaxy Note 2 is opened up
to applications faster being YouTube and
Google Earth and the calculator was a
draw of course we'll do Temple Run and
this time seems to be faster on the
iPhone 5 yeah so it's going through a
slow transition animation here and now
it is on the Galaxy Note 2 go ahead and
exit out of
next up will be wordpress so tap these
guys at the same time and a little bit
faster on the iPhone 5 and not only that
die from five actually loaded up the
content as far as the articles I wrote
on bone buff where the Galaxy Note 2
just loaded up this little menu so
pretty impressive there for the iPhone 5
so right now it's 2 and 2 Google Earth
and YouTube open up that's from the note
2 and then Temple Run and WordPress
faster on the iPhone 5 so let's go ahead
and go to Twitter and faster on the
Galaxy Note 2 here so Galaxy Note 2 now
house three wins go to dictionary and
faster on the Galaxy Note 2 um we got
this little pop-up but it was maybe you
know half a second faster we'll go ahead
and go to the next tab which is gonna be
Flixter and seem to be a little bit
faster on the iPhone 5 in this case and
last up will do is gonna be score Center
and faster on the iPhone 5 again so
because these apps do multitask a little
bit differently we're gonna go kind of
backwards or in reverse order as far as
opening the application so we're gonna
go to score Center and this time let's
actually move around so we'll go from
one tab to the next and seems faster on
iphone 5 still let's go ahead and go to
movies by Flixter and we'll go to
another tab we'll go to go to theaters
so tap theaters and pretty much the same
thing here we'll go to dictionary and
you know it's pretty much the theme is
they're running at the same speed so now
let's go ahead and do the camera app so
go ahead and tap camera at the same time
and see which one actually shows the
viewfinder first so that was really
really close really tough call you guys
might have to be the judge of that one
if I had a guess maybe a little bit
faster on the galaxy note 2 but I'm
really not sure I would have thought you
know watch that in slow motion almost on
video instead of seeing in you know real
person so that's the application speed
test pretty much I'll call it a draw
means some apps open up fast from the
galaxy note 2 some apps open up faster
on the iPhone 5
typically what the Android you know the
iPhone or the iOS was always faster
compared to Android but now with
jellybean and this super powerful
processor on the Galaxy Note 2 seems
like it took care of that issue boot of
tests was loaded faster on the iPhone 5
but now let's go to the browser test so
this is you know one of the most
important tests I think when it comes to
speed test and that's how fast can each
device render a website first website
we'll go to is gonna be foam buff calm
alright so I just did a quick google
search for foam buff so that way the
Galaxy Note 2's you know pre loading
feature doesn't play a part here go
ahead and tap on the link at the same
time and see which one actually loads
the website up first so seeing the
content a little bit faster on the
iPhone 5 and seeing the ads first on the
Galaxy Note 2 and they're both done now
so I mean when it comes to the status
bar the iPhone 5 actually showed that it
finished first loading up the initial
pictures as faster than the iPhone 5 but
the ads and everything else loaded up
faster on the galaxy note 2 and taking
into account that you know we're seeing
much more information on the galaxy note
2 you know it probably makes up for that
difference I have to call Taiwan a draw
really because it was too close to call
well go ahead and go to this article
right here hopefully we get some better
separation so again faster content on
the iPhone 5 pictures faster so that way
I could give the win to the iPhone 5
because it was pretty significant and
you know it seemed like it actually made
a difference so let's go to another
website will go to NFL also did a Google
search for NFL tap the first link and
you see we're seeing the content first
on the iPhone 5 pictures and articles
and still waiting on the Galaxy Note 2
so we got a little pop up on iPhone 5
asking for us to download the app and
now the Galaxy Note 2 is done and that
pop ups are gonna come up any second out
but we'll go ahead and go to another
site which is gonna be in gadget also we
googled Engadget we'll go ahead and tap
on the first link at the same time and
looks like with all the cons that little
fast from the iPhone 5 it's done loading
and now the Galaxy Note 2 is done
loading we'll go ahead and look at the
full site because that was a really
close one tries to see if we get some
more stuff
raishin tap on desktop seeing the
content first on the iPhone 5 seeing
some you know little banners here
loading up first on the galaxy note
though now everything else loaded up on
the iPhone 5 and we're still waiting on
the Galaxy Note 2 so I have to say that
it is faster on the iPhone 5 once again
alright so we'll go ahead and tap on one
of these articles so we'll tap on the
central one right over here tap them at
the same time and really close right now
but it looks like the iPhone 5 does have
a slight edge iPhone 5 says it's done
but we're actually seeing the
advertisement for surface here faster
and I probably see on the top
notification bar it's still loading
things in the background so the win
actually goes to the Galaxy Note 2 here
still hasn't even showed us the
advertisement so that's something to
take into consideration to finish off
the browser test risk and go ahead and
do a quick browser like benchmark
alright so loaded up the browser
benchmark site we'll go ahead and start
the benchmark and I'm just kind of skip
through the whole process and get
straight to the results
you
also the browser drunk benchmark is done
and both devices scored a really really
high score the Galaxy Note 2 got a score
of one hundred eighty-two thousand seven
hundred and seventy and the iPhone 5
scored a one hundred eighty 6868 so only
eight about you know four thousand you
know point difference really really
close and that's pretty much what was
reflected you know in the actual
browsing test I mean both were really
really fast some websites loaded up
faster on the iPhone five some loaded up
faster on the galaxy note 2 but as far
as you know overall speed I'd have to
call it a draw between these two devices
I'm actually you know pretty impressed
I've always known you know iOS is a
little bit faster as far as these speed
optimizations that's why they you know
lesser Hardware then Android can but
with jelly jelly beans speed
improvements it seems like it's actually
really really fast on the galaxy note 2
of course when you actually test
multitasking you'll do better on the
galaxy note 2 because it does have more
RAM and actually they could handle more
application running at the same time
compared to the iPhone 5 with one
gigabyte of RAM but overall I mean both
devices are super super fast you know I
really I really can't give the edge to
any one device here but that's pretty
much it for me and the speed test if you
