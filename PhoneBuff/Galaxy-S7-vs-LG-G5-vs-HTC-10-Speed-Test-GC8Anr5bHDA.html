plus three speed test is coming I
promise but first things first we have
to figure out which phone it'll face so
today we're pitting three phones against
one another in the Exynos variant of the
s7 the LG g5 and the HTC ten all these
phones faced off against the Snapdragon
variant of the s7 in the previous
episode and all of them came out
victorious so let's find out which phone
is the Android speed test champ and
which phone will defend that title in
the next episode on your mark get set go
alright so right off the bat the LG g5
takes the lead being the quickest to
snap a selfie with the galaxy s7 right
behind it and the HTC 10 falling into
third as the HTC 10 tries his best to
make up for its sluggish start the g5
looks to keep its lead being the first
to move on to asphalt 8 but the galaxy
s7 is still hot on its heels looking to
make a comeback in the speed test and
actually does as it passes the g5 and
moves on to clash of clans so as you can
see this is still anybody's race even
the HTC 10 which is now a full lap
behind the other two with it barely
getting started on clash of clans and
the galaxy s7 ahead of the pack working
on Photoshop mix but if there is going
to be a comeback it's most likely gonna
have to be in laps it where each fall
will have to create a time-lapse from
the same exact video file so the two
phones to keep an eye on right now are
the s7 and the g5 as both aren't laps it
with both processing the same video and
the g5 is actually recaptured the lead
with it passing the s7 and continuing to
add on to its lead frame by frame so a
great comeback by the g5 we'll see if
the HTC 10 can do the same since it has
the Snapdragon processor as well and
yeah it looks like it is going at a
faster rate but it might be too little
too late as both the g5 and now the s7
have both moved on to ESPN and Netflix
so as the galaxy s7 finishes ESPN the g5
finishes with Netflix putting it a full
lap ahead and really redeeming the
Snapdragon 820 processor which just look
weak under the hood of the u.s. variant
of the s7 but on the g5 it's firing on
also
finishing the first lap with a time of 1
minute and 36 seconds the galaxy s7
finishes 6 seconds later with a time of
1 minute and 42 seconds with the g5
having to reload Angry Birds so this
just maybe with the s7 regains the lead
and it has Angry Birds open and ready to
go in the background as it does asphalt
8 so yet another comeback for the s7
while the ACC's hadn't finished that
first lap with a time of 1 minute and 56
seconds and despite its lackluster first
lap the HTC 10 is flying through this
second lap having most of the apps ready
to go so it just may make a last-minute
comeback with all three phones at this
point just sprinting towards the finish
line and the s7 gets there first with
the HTC 10 almost completing the
comeback finishing second and the g5
coming in third water race what a finish
with the winner and Android speed -
champ the galaxy s7 thank you guys for
watching it as always I'll see you in
the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
