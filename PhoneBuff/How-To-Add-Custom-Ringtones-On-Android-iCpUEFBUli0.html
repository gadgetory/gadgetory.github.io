in this video I'm showing you how to set
your own custom ringtone on your Android
phone so first things first I want to
show you how to set your ringtone to
begin with so what you're going to do is
go to your settings you could also press
from the home screen menu and then
settings but in this case I'm just gonna
go to the Settings icon doesn't matter
how you get here as long as you get here
go to sound once you're here though and
you can see right here you have an
option for phone ringtone so when I hit
this you see I have a whole bunch of
ringtones in this list these are just
pretty much the stock ones that come
with Android and if I wanted to set one
I can just tap it hit OK and I've
changed my ringtone
but let's say the song I wonder our mp3
file I wanted isn't included in here so
the way I could make it show up in that
list is I go over to a file explorer so
I've download the ES File Explorer from
the Android Market it's free and I
definitely recommend it what you want to
do is from your the very root of the
phone as far as you can go you want to
go over to a folder called ringtones now
if that folder doesn't exist you should
create it by pressing menu and then new
and then of course yet folder and then
name it ringtones but I already have it
created so what I want to do is go over
to my music file where I have all my
music stored and let's say I wanted to
make this song my ringtone so what I'll
do is copy it and then hit back and go
over to ringtones and I'm just going to
go ahead and paste it so paste right
there and there you go I've pasted it
into the ringtones file and now when I
go over to my settings and then go into
my ringtone list you'll see that it
actually shows up right there
so you hit it hit OK and I've got the
song that I wanted as my ringtone and
that the same thing applies when you're
trying to do text message notifications
as well it would show up in a folder
called notifications right here so I
already have the ones I have but if you
wanted to something else as your text
message notification you just paste it
in here and it'll show up in the list
when you go to set it alright that's it
for me in this video this is David foam
