bluff and in this video we'll be doing
what it looks like and doing a
durability test on the HTC one we
actually have a couple of tests we'll be
doing
one is the key test which is probably
the most practical most realistic out of
this whole test we're also gonna be
doing a knife scratch and stab test to
see how tough the screen and also the
actual body of the phone is and the
final ring of doing a hammer drop or
mallet drop test to see how much
resistance the screen could take and
also maybe we'll slam it on the back a
couple of times to see you know how it
fares so with that said let's go ahead
and begin with the easiest test out of
the three released what seems to be the
easiest test and that's the key scratch
test to see you know what's going to
happen to the screen so we'll actually
turn off the display and I'll show you
the display right now no scratches or
anything like that couple of finger
prints you might be able to see but for
the most part it's pretty much perfect
condition so let's go ahead and actually
wipe this off really quick and start
scratch test so got a key right here I'm
going to be doing these rough edges
right here scratching it all across the
screen so and I'm going to be applying
quite a bit of pressure because I know
the screen has Gorilla Glass and gragas
is really really good at resisting
scratches like this in fact they're
actually built to resist scratches like
key so I expect it to pass this test and
uh looking at it you can see no doubt
man we have to wipe it off usually I
have to wipe it off nothing here this is
Gorilla Glass 2 I will try on the back
though this is what I'm actually more
interested about because knowing that
the screen has Gorilla Glass I expected
that you know but on the back I want to
see how this full metal body actually
handles scratches because yeah the
phone's beautiful but you know will it
be able to survive or you not get
damaged without a case so I don't know
if you guys could see that but there is
a whole bunch of little scratch marks on
the back we're going to go ahead and try
to wipe it off so get this microfiber
cloth and
they do wipe off seems like some residue
there let's see if I could rub it off my
finger
yeah so I guess my finger has the magic
touch because all of it went away so
first scratch test you know what the key
I'd say it's a pass you know the screen
pass with flying colors obviously the
screen still works we didn't put any
kind of real pressure on here to make it
crack or anything like that so scratch
test for the key is a pass let's go
ahead and bring out this humongous
kitchen knife so again we'll try the
screen and what we're going to do here
actually is also test these fine edges
over here on the east see when these
fine finished edges because it's similar
to what it was on the iPhone 5 member
when I did the iPhone 5 test it did
actually sustain a quite a few scratches
here so first we'll do the screen so and
I am applying pressure I'm not you know
scared to put pressure on it I actually
have a lot of trust and Grill does have
test a grill glass quite a bit at my
time and all right so that should be
enough punishment for now and again I I
don't really see anything I mean I don't
see anything in person and on camera
nothing is obviously showing we'll go
ahead and try to clean this off see if
that does anything and yeah I mean it
looks beautiful 100% perfect so we'll go
ahead and test the back so this is again
the one that I'm much more interested in
let's do a little bit of stabbing
actually what we'll do stab me up after
so again you can see there is scratches
on the back and uh you know I be pretty
bummed out if I saw this on my phone go
ahead and try to wipe it off and the
microfiber cloth doesn't seem to do a
job it seems like actually lick my
finger a little to get some moisture and
rub it off of my finger end now these
scratches are definitely a lot deeper
actually and it doesn't seem like it's
actually coming off so try to really rub
them off here now actually there some of
these they're really light and they're I
think you can see that with that angle
they're really
the light scratches but they're not
coming off um I'll go ahead and try to
rub it off a little bit more and yeah I
mean you you definitely could see them
not from a distance obviously I can't
seem fear but when I look up close with
my eye I can actually see them so uh I
think yeah there you go so you can see
it right there those scratches are not
coming off so definitely something to
keep in mind you know like I said it's a
beautiful phone but if you drop it and
get some scratches in here it might not
come off light scratches like with keys
shouldn't be an issue so I throw it in
your pocket or purse with some keys
probably won't be an issue but like I
said you could see the scratches and
I'll try to wipe it off later more I
mean it doesn't look like it's actually
going to wipe off it looks like they're
pretty permanent as far as that knife
test goes obviously you're not gonna
slash your phone with a knife hopefully
so uh not that big of an issue but
definitely something to consider so now
let's go to maybe the most exciting test
which is the mallet smashing time so
we'll go ahead and take this guy and
start smashing the screen to see you
know if you could take you know moderate
pressure obviously like I said if you
drop this thing on the floor face down
from like five feet up it's gonna crack
I mean any glass is going to crack so we
want to see what it does with this thing
so
all right so you could hear how loud
that was because obviously I was
applying a bunch of bunch of pressure
but screen still working let's go ahead
and clean it off see if that left any
kind of residue but now the screen looks
perfect so so far from the test that
we've done only real damage is again
these light light scratches so actually
I forgot I actually skipped the side
scratch so I want to scratch these
little fine edges over here so oh yeah
yeah you can definitely see that try to
get a better angle so you can see those
scratches there and those things are not
coming off so it's just like the iPhone
I mean it looks really really nice but
it is prone to scratching this part at
least so go to the glass screen actually
really good when it comes to scratch
resistance obviously is not scratch
proof and it will actually end up
scratching these more usually elements
that are harder than the screen itself
like sand or something like that I might
do a test of that in the future if you
guys want but for just regular scratches
if you drop it on the on on the floor
the screen is gonna be good
the back might get scratched up it's
pretty resistant but if you get it a
kitchen knife like this then yeah and it
apply as much pressure as I did you'll
get some light light scratches and then
like I said on these edges you're bound
to see some scribe actually while trying
to see is how vulnerable it is by doing
the key so the key you know shouldn't be
that bad all right so you can see the
markings on on this part but I think
that wipes off yes so it wipes off and I
don't really see anything actually no I
do yep even with the key you can see
scratches here on the edges so you know
it's a beautiful phone I would love to
hold it or use it without a case but
maybe a case is worth investing in
because it can get scratched up
especially along these edges because it
scratches pretty easily the back is
pretty distressed resistant in the front
the glass it's pretty good but anyways
that's pretty much it for me in this
video if you found it helpful or if you
liked it please give it a thumbs up and
I might be doing a discretion
destruction video our more videos like
this on the HTC one if you guys want to
see them let me know down in the
comments but anyway thank you for
