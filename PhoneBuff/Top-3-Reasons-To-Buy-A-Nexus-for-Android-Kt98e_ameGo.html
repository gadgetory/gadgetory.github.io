and in this video i'm giving you the top
three reasons or top three advantages to
buying a nexus branded android
smartphone over just about any other
type of android smartphone out there so
obviously can make an argument for
against the next to sign up but for the
purpose of this video i'm doing an
argument for it giving you the reasons
why I actually picked up the Galaxy
Nexus and also why I plan on buying the
next Nexus phone once it drops with
android 5.0 pain so the first reason is
developer support and basically what
that means is this is the phone or the
next is the phone that app developers
are actually using to test a rap song to
make sure that everything works
flawlessly to make sure there's no bugs
or force close issues or anything like
that so what does that mean for you it
means that if you have a nexus phone
you're going to get greater developer
support your phone is going to run the
apps you know the way that developer
meant it to be ram and you know just
gonna have a better experience but it's
kind of like a double-edged sword
because in the beginning when you get a
nexus phone for example when I got the
galaxy nexus with Andrew four-point-oh a
lot of the apps were actually broken so
it's kind of backward I mean lot of apps
were incompatible with the Galaxy Nexus
because developers hadn't yet made their
apps compatible with it but a few months
down the line everything was sorted out
you know now this won't mean pretty much
every description that you see with a
app it says it works on the Galaxy Nexus
so that's an advantage on the next
advantage is that there's no
manufacturer blower on this guy I mean
that's an awesome thing on obviously the
verizon version of the Galaxy Nexus has
a few apps on their from verizon this is
the unlock hspa+ version and if you look
at it mean there is no apps on here from
t-mobile just the carrier I'm running it
on on there's no apps from Samsung it's
just pretty much pure Google and
obviously that's you know something that
you're gonna like live you don't want
things that you on your phone that you
haven't installed yourself obviously you
could get a lot of stuff that you know
its value added by the carrier
manufacturer but I know personally I
like to have the choice and I feel like
you know if you really wanted something
there's now for that so that's the
second advantage and the third one is
probably the main reason why you'd want
to get in
this phone is the longevity or the
support that you get with this guy so
this guy is running Android 4.0 Ice
Cream Sandwich obviously I shoulda has
been out since November and yet you know
only eight percent of the phones out
there are actually running it so in the
first one being the galaxy nexus of the
next one after the Galaxy Nexus was the
next success and obviously it took about
three or four months for it to get that
and a lot of people are complaining
about that saying oh the next phone
supposed to get updated fast but the
reality is still get updated a lot
faster than most of the other android
phones out there and even new android
phones up before they launch so getting
a nexus keeps you updated and not only
that I mean it's not about just the
speed of updates it's also how many
updates you get as far as the lifespan
of the phone so if you look at this
chart right now you can see that the
Nexus fondant in this case it's the HTC
nexus one it was getting updated to the
next version of android a lot more often
a lot faster and basically longer than
any other android phone and it was
compared it was like basically
comparative to the iphone at that time
which was always getting the next
version depend even if it was the older
model so basically what that means is
the nexus is pretty much the only phone
that has the same longevity as does a
phone like the iPhone and you know
that's something I really noticed i mean
i got the galaxy s with timo which is
called the vibrant it had 2.1 when it
came on and i was really hoping to get
2.2 because all the speed improvements
the one not and by the time i got 2.2
2.3 already been released so it's almost
already like old news and I always felt
like I was one step behind with that
phone obviously i rooted it and got the
new version on there but most consumers
aren't going to do that so that's
definitely a disadvantage to not getting
a nexus fungus with a nexus phone you
don't have to worry about that if you do
like rooting well you know phones better
support in the developer community then
the Nexus phones anyway so that's pretty
much I mean the main reasons I mean you
get updated to the latest version of
Android in your phone lasts a lot longer
um you're going to have the phone that
developers are actually using the apps
to test on and also you're not going to
have manufacturer blow around here
taking a memory for no reason and also I
mean you don't have to scroll through a
whole bunch of pages that you don't have
to I mean definitely a lot
love there any way is this one to make a
quick video about that um that's pretty
much it for me thank you for watching
