let's finish oh you the differences
between the old D to Bob that came with
Ice Cream Sandwich compared to the new
YouTube app now just recently updated by
Google so I just opened both of these
guys up and they both took me to this
page where I see my recent videos from
the channels I'm subscribed to on the
right on the old version you have
smaller thumbnails with the text on the
right and on the new version you have
larger thumbnails which does look a
little bit better with white text over
top of them not that big of an issue to
me either way I mean I it's I think it's
better looking but at the same time I
feel like this is a little bit more
efficient because you see like six
videos at once compared to just three
but not that big of an issue I do like
the new way to navigate around the new
YouTube app so for example over here on
the old version if I want to see my
categories I'd swipe over to the right
wanna see my account so I were again I
see my channel stats my uploads
favorites playlist etc on this version
what you do is you just swipe over to
the left and you can just tap on account
right here at the top so you actually
see some more information this time or
different information so I see my video
views in total for my channel compared
to just my channel views which is nice
you also have an extra tab or two which
is watch later and history when I go
back out of here I also have the option
to see all the channels that I'm
subscribed to and their specific videos
as you can see they're showing up right
here so pretty cool way to navigate over
here I have to hit subscriptions and
then find the channel I want tap on that
channel and then go to it that way so a
little bit faster to get to you know the
videos do you want from the channel you
want I wanted to regular categories like
I have over here under browse I just
keep scrolling down and there they are
but again not that big of a change um I
do like it I think it's a little bit
more convenient at least for the way I
use YouTube app but what I think it
really excels in I suppose the new app
is the way you watch videos so I'll go
ahead and load up this video really
quick on both phones so let's go to
uploads and load up this video so as you
can see both videos are loading up but
it does look a little bit
so this one's volume up is up anyway um
as you can see you see the like bar
right here it's actually showing green
verse over here you just have regular
text which is nice you have the option
to subscribe right there where over here
you don't so I mean a little bit of
differences you see the description the
same way nothing different you have the
related comments tab and nothing changed
but I don't know if you guys can see
that right here you have a red little
red slider that I could actually
fast-forward and rewind on the video
which is awesome but over here there's
no such option you know in order for me
to fast-forward I actually have to take
this guy and tilt it which you know I
always do because I do watch a lot of
YouTube on my phone and I have to swipe
over like that so it's nice to be able
to watch it in that portrait mode if I
wanted to and be able to fast-forward
the same time so definitely a cool
advantage right there but other than
that I mean there isn't really that big
of a difference between the YouTube app
obviously you know with any new version
it's better I do like it I feel like
everything's a little bit bigger if you
guys noticed that I feel like the like
buttons bigger that text is a little bit
bigger but anyway that's pretty much it
for me in this video just wanted to make
a quick video showing us the differences
if you found it helpful please hit the
like button and subscribe thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
