ball calm and today I'll be giving you a
quick look at the camera on the Galaxy
Nexus and Android Ice Cream Sandwich so
a lot of people in saying that the
camera on the Galaxy Nexus is
disappointing mainly due to the fact
that on the back you have a 5 micro Sol
camera instead of a 8 megapixel camera
like you would see on devices like the
iPhone 4s and even Samsung's own galaxy
s2 and all those devices came out before
the Galaxy Nexus so somewhat surprising
to see only a 5 Mixel camera on this guy
but with that said the image quality is
still really good although it isn't as
good as the iPhone 4s and the Galaxy s2
in my opinion it's pretty close and I
really don't think that the focus was
really on the image quality so much as
it was to the features of the camera
rings through Ice Cream Sandwich on the
Galaxy Nexus so with that said I'll go
and show you what I mean all right so
I'll go ahead and launch the camera and
first thing I want to show you is the
amazingly fast shutter speed that this
camera has so I'll press the shutter
button and I just took three pictures in
the time that it would take probably to
take one picture on some of the other
high-end smartphones available on the
market so well you may not get the best
image quality you definitely do get the
best opportunity to capture your Kodak
moments so to speak
according to show you the video route of
camera and you can record in 1080p which
is really nice but I think that
distinguishes this between other phones
is you can actually zoom in and zoom out
why are you recording the video so it
gives you more of a camcorder feel which
I'm really impressed with I'll go ahead
and give you a walkthrough of some of
these settings so I'll go to camera turn
on settings and you have the ability to
turn flash on off or put it on auto you
could have dress your white balance you
can change your exposure settings put
different scenes on and I decide whether
or not you want to store your location
and the picture size which currently is
set to 5 megapixels of course
I'll go to the video settings and uh
same thing you get the flash again you
can turn it on or off you could turn or
change your white balance on the camry
of these effects that are new with
Android Ice Cream Sandwich things like
silly faces and background which I'll
show you in a little bit you also have
time lapse and you can change your video
quality and also again whether or not
you want it to store your location so
I'll go ahead and show you the funny
faces effects that it has surround the
front-facing camera really quick and you
can see I have it on squeeze so it
squeezes my face and the coolest thing
about it is I could actually move my
face around and it'll track me so I
don't have to you know just stand still
in the middle for it to work
I got should go up down and side to side
and that works just fine so pretty
impressed with that and I'll let me show
you another one to actually turn the sky
back on I'll show you in space so you
have to leave your phone steady like
that it basically just takes a picture
of the what the front-facing camera is
seeing and it will detect any change so
when I drink bring my finger over it
looks like my fingers out there in space
with the Android guy so that's pretty
cool and yeah of course you could record
a video like that too
and last but not least you have panorama
mode on the camera and this lets you
take you know full 180 angles of
whatever picture you have I don't have a
lot of room to actually demonstrate this
but just take my word for it it works
really well and overall I'm pretty
impressed with the camera that comes
with the Galaxy Nexus although I do wish
that it had better image quality I'm not
complaining by any means I'm happy with
it it's a lot of fun to play with all
those effects and it takes decent
pictures alright that's it for me this
is Dave from foam off comm thank you for
watching the video
