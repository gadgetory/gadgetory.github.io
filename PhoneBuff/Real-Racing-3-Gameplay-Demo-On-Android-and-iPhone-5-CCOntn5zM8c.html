bluff and in this video i wanted to do a
quick gameplay demo of real racing 3
which is now available for both Android
and iOS on the respective app stores and
the price is actually free that's right
EA has released this game for nothing of
course there are some in-game purchases
you can make to unlock things faster and
things of that nature but the bottom
line here is you get to play a console
quality game with basically console
quality graphics for your mobile devices
running Android or iOS for absolutely
free as you can see here the game runs
pretty smoothly on my galaxy note 2 of
course your experience may differ a bit
depending on what device you're using
i'll go ahead and demo the iphone 5
really quick just for comparison's sake
so as you can see you know both phones
run the game really smoothly of course
they're both really high-end phones I'm
really gotten to delve into the game
itself just yet but believe me I will be
doing that over the next couple of weeks
just wanted to make this video showing
you guys the graphics I mean I've been
waiting for this game since pretty much
back in September when Apple have their
event for the iphone 5 so yeah I mean
that's pretty much it for me in this
video I definitely recommend checking
out the game I mean the game is free so
you really don't have anything to lose
well actually make sure you download it
over Wi-Fi as it is a pretty big file
and you know to download over your
mobile data connection you might lose
you know that data but I have to give
credit to EA games for the game that
they put together here which you know
they allow you to play for free which is
awesome course you know like I said we
could do those add-ons that you could
buy to accelerate you know how quickly
you progress in the game but you know
they allow you to play online and do so
so much more which I can't really get
into you're considering is just a quick
demo but I might be doing a review on
the game in the future so stay tuned for
that anyways like I said that's it for
me in this video if you liked it please
give it a thumbs up and subscribe to the
channel for more mobile tech videos just
like this thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
