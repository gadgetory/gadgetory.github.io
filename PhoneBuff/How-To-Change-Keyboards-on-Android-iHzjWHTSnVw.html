today i'll be doing a video on how to
switch out your keyboard i just
downloaded the Gingerbread keyboard from
the market and i'm gonna show you guys
how to actually activate this guy 30 hit
the HOME key alright you can see that I
just installed it and what you want to
do is you're going to hit menu and then
settings and from the settings menu let
me zoom in for you guys to see you're
going to look for something along the
lines of language or keyboard depending
on your model phone it's going to be
different but something similar to that
are close enough to that should I say so
you can see there's a two keyboard
options really there's a gingerbread
keyboard and the touch input this is HTC
Sensation so that's the sense keyboard
which is currently activated you can
tell by if I hit search can see it
alright anyway I want to activate the
Gingerbread keyboard so the way I'm
going to do that is hit that checkmark
hit OK and what you'll notice is though
a lot of people run into this they'll
think that that will do it they'll hit
something and pop up the keyboard and
will notice the same old keyboard comes
up so what are you supposed to do at
this point what you have to do is long
press so find that empty text field so
at the very top the empty text field
won't press and hold and you can see
that little pop up and as the pop is
gonna look therefore on your phone this
is sense so it shows up like that on
other phones is a little rectangle or a
box that shows up in the middle of the
screen so anyway you can hit input
method and you can see it's on touch
input which is the sense keyboard I'm
just going to hit Gingerbread and voila
you've got the Gingerbread keyboard up
and running and this works with any
keyboard and if you want to switch it
same idea you're going to be able to
actually do it from right from here
instead of having to go through the
settings you just say input method
touch input and there you go the reason
why I went to the settings first is for
the ginger wiki where you had the first
activator for some reason alright but
that's pretty much it this is David
