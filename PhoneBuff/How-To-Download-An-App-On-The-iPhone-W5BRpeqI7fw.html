in this video i'm going to show you not
only how to download an app on your
iphone but also how to determine whether
or not an app is worth downloading so
first thing I'm going to show you is how
to download an app so I'm just going to
go to a free up really quick and just
hit download so what you're going to do
is press the either the free button up
here or the purchase button up here so
in this case it's free I'm gonna hit
install app again and see the app is
being installed so i just recently
installed an app ready for this so
that's why i didn't ask me for a
password if you haven't a little pop-up
box will come up asking you to type in
your itunes password do so and the app
will be downloaded installed
automatically on your phone now quickly
go back to the app store and show you
how to actually tell whether or not an
app is worth downloading first thing you
want to look at and the most obvious
thing is the rating so this one has been
rated four and a half stars out of five
stars based off 2045 ratings second
thing of course is you want to read the
description to see if the app is
actually going to do what you want it to
do third thing is look at the pictures
of the app to kind of get a feel for the
user interface and the features of the
app of course you can look at the
ratings in more depth if you want to do
by pressing on that guy and also at the
very bottom you have the most recent
update to the app so this one was
updated on April 7 2012 which was just
about a week ago so it tells me that you
know the app is being supported by the
developer you know the developer is
releasing updates constantly because if
you see an app that has been updated for
like two years you know the app is
probably going to have some bugs with
the on it it's probably not going to
have as many features as you'd like and
that you might want to you know look
look elsewhere but that's pretty much it
for me in this video this is dave
infocom thank you for watching it and
don't forget to visit bomble com or cell
phone news reviews and how to's thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
