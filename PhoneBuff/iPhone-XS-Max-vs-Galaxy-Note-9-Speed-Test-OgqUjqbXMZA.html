the match up we have all been waiting
for since all the way back at the end of
2017 when the node age surprised
everyone and beat the iphone 8 plus in a
speed test but today it's apples chance
to finally redeem itself with the all
new iphone 10's max which is not only
powered by Apple's new 812 Bionic chip
which they claim low zaps up to 30%
faster but it also is packin more RAM at
4 gigabytes instead of just 3 the note 9
on the other hand comes equipped with
this Snapdragon 845 coupled with just an
insane ADEs gigabytes of RAM so it's
gonna be a close one will be a 12 Bionic
chip and the 4 gigabytes of RAM that be
enough for the iPhone 10s to outperform
the no 9 or will the note 9 be able to
beat it and back up all the smack that
Samsung has been talking about Apple in
their ads let's find out
with the power in your smartphone and
which artificial design intelligence you
can build a website run on your phone in
just minutes

okay so we'll kick things off by
starting the stopwatch us on each phone
and then jump right into the first row
where both phones just fly through
Facebook and start working on Starbucks
with the iPhone finishing the app first
and already moving on to Microsoft Word
where each phone will load up the same
exact document with the iPhone just
ripping through it and already working
on Excel with it being able to finish up
with Excel before the note 9 finished
with word putting it a full lap ahead
very early on in this speed test
die phone 10s was actually able to load
both Excel and Word 2 times faster than
the note 9 so it'll be interesting to
see if the no.9 can someone stop the
bleeding here in the second row and turn
things around by cutting into the iPhone
sleeve but at least so far that doesn't
look like it's going to happen with node
9 exporting the photo and Snapseed at a
slower rates and exporting the video
clip here and premieres significantly
slower as well allowing the iPhone to
turn that one Apple II did had earlier
into a full to app lead with it already
halfway done with the gaming row as the
no.9 stuttered in the browser test so
very interesting results so far it seems
like apples claimed that the 812 Bionic
ship can load apps up to 30% faster
holds true but at the same time at least
some of the difference could also be
attributed to the optimizations in iOS
12
either way the iPhone status max moves
on to the last row here in the first lap
as the no.9 continues to fall further
and further behind
loading subway surfers flip diving and
fit the fat at a slower rate but the
iPhone did stutter a bit in ESPN giving
the no.9 an opportunity to make up some
ground here in the first lap before both
phones start working on the second which
the iPhone is about to enter as it
completes the first lap in
pres of time of 1 minute and 49 seconds
where we'll get to see if the extra gig
of ram the Apple added to the 10s will
be enough to keep the no 9 from making a
comeback and so far the iPhone has kept
all of the apps open including subway
surfers in Napa Lloyd iPhone 10 always
seem to struggle the note 9 finally
joins the iPhone here in the second lap
taking a full 22 seconds longer to
finish the first and with the iPhone
keeping both Excel and word open things
aren't looking good for the notes
however the iPhone does fail to keep
Starbucks open but it likely won't
matter with the iPhone keeping Facebook
open allowing it to finish the test
first with a total time of 2 minutes and
33 seconds with the note 9 and its
whopping 8 gigabytes of RAM being able
to keep all the apps open completing the
task with a total time of 2 minutes and
47 seconds making the winner the iPhone
10s max for the updated speed test
