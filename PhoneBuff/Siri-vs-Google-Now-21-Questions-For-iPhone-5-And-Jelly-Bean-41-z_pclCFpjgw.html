this is gonna be doing a comparison
between Siri on the iPhone 5 and iOS 6
against Google now on the Samsung Galaxy
s3 and Android 4.1.1 jelly bean to see
which voices isn't comes out on top I'm
gonna be asking each a series of 21
questions to see not only which one
answer is more accurately but also which
one answers quicker because ultimately
when using your voice you want a fast
response otherwise you just type it in
it's worth noting that both devices are
connected to the same Wi-Fi network so
what that says go ahead and start the
test what's the weather like in Las
Vegas answered accurately however it's a
little bit faster on Google now how far
away is Las Vegas from here got our
answer here
looks like navigation is opening up on
the iPhone 5 and Siri got her answer
technically it took a little longer
because it actually opened up you know
for navigation I'm gonna hit end over
there so both were accurate however
faster on Google now again let's ask
another question when is Mother's Day we
got our answer already on Google now
looks like the iPhone 5 and Siri error
hanged up right now they're you know
it's basically circling searching for
something but hasn't give us a response
just yet it seems like Siri does that
once in a while I mean sometimes I ask
the same question and answer
automatically no right away just as fast
as Google now does however sometimes it
seems like there's a server hang-up and
it just takes a little bit longer than
usual like it did right there
so let's go on to the next question what
are some sushi restaurants nearby
looking for restaurants whose reviews
mentioned sushi okay these restaurants
alright though
we still on go now we got a list of
restaurants that serve sushi there's a
little bit faster than was on the iPhone
5 in Syria however it's worth mentioning
that the iPhone 5 in Syria was giving us
much more detail you know we have
reviews we have the address we have how
far it is away and also the price range
so you're getting more information on
Siri however it is a little bit faster
on Google now all right so that's the
next question make it reservation for
two at riptide tonight at eight o'clock
so on Google now just did a Google
search pretty much no results that I was
looking for and actually you know opened
up open table I can make a reservation
just like I wanted and hit make a
reservation right there so it actually
worked the way I wanted this guy just
made a Google search I got you know what
I said right but it didn't respond you
know the way I wanted so let's go on to
the next test how many u.s. presidents
have there been so we just got a Google
search over here we got a direct answer
of 43 on the iPhone 5 and Siri we
technically get their answer that we
want here in the results but it wasn't a
direct answer so we had to give you know
the edge to Siri here let's go on to the
next question
call Best Buy in Irvine so Google now
says cannot find any contacts to call on
Siri it actually gives us a list of best
buys I can just tap the one that I want
to call so it's pretty cool let's go on
to the next question what is 500 divided
by 22 radion boom now got the answer on
Siri now however like I said it was a
little bit faster on Google now so let's
go on to the next one how many inches
are there in a meter got the answer
already on Google now
here's what I found and now we got the
answer on Ceres so again the theme seems
to be it's a little bit faster on Google
now let's go to the next question how
far is the moon from the earth so we got
the answer again on Google now and now
we got the answer on Ceres so again same
answer however a little bit faster on
Google now so let's go to the next one
text Google search what are you doing
today search so both are working
correctly here I'll just have to tap
send and it would work I'm hit cancel
okay so both rocket they're both are
pretty fast right there so let's go to
the next question
wake me up at 8:00 a.m. so both of whom
set the alarm automatically which is
nice let's go ahead and you know let's
do the same type of question but a
little bit further into the future
wake me up at 7:00 a.m. on Friday sorry
alarms and reminders only support times
of the day but not dates also said on
Siri can't set an alarm for more than
one day ahead but it gives us an option
to set a calendar reminder which is nice
you know it kind of shows you that it's
a little bit more intelligent as far as
the voices isn't it kind of gets you
know your point as far as what you want
I'll hit cancel let's go on to the next
question
remind me to take the food out of the
oven in 10 minutes shall I create it so
both of them set the reminder correctly
this one actually said a that seems like
a calendar event but at 1:45 right now
it's 1:35 so both worked the way I
wanted let's go ahead and ask it a
sports question who do the rest gains
whoops let's try that again all right
let's try it again
who do the rest can spray this week so
Google now actually gave me the result
of last week's game you know reminded me
of how they lost
however the seer our Siri and iPhone 5
actually shows me the you know the
answer to the question I was looking for
it tells me who they're playing next now
and that it gives me the time we're so
it's pretty cool right there let's say
for example you're you know in a little
debate with one of your friends about
let's say another sport basketball about
Kobe Bryant versus LeBron James
you could ask it you know a question so
who is taller LeBron James are a Kobe
Bryant so over here we just got a Google
search you know of course we could find
it through the results I mean it tells
you LeBron James is 6/8 Kobe Bryant is
67 but over here you gets a direct
answer we get that height right over
here we can scroll down and see the
player cards for each let's ask it
another question wasps gape how many
points per game did Kobe Bryant score
last season so again we got a direct
answer on Syria for the sports question
on Google now I just you know did a
Google search and of course like I said
we could find it here but it wasn't
direct so we have to give the edge to
Siri there let's ask it another question
what does lol stand for gave us the
answer correctly however is a little bit
faster on Google now which is again the
recurring theme will be here all right
so let's go ahead and ask another
question what is the minimum wage in
California so we got the answer on
Google now eight dollars an hour and our
waiting on Siri and the iPhone 5
again it seems to be like hung up on the
server seems like there you go check so
it actually didn't give us a the answer
we're looking for it give us
I think the median income for California
or something like that then actually
give us the minimum wage and I don't see
minimum wage anywhere on here so
incorrect answer it also took longer it
was faster on Google now and it gave us
the right answer let's ask another
question like what does the iPhone 5
look like pictures of the iPhone 5 here
as far as the Google Images and over
here just asking for a web search
horsepower to top that it'll open up
Safari and do a Google you know web
search and it's actually web it doesn't
actually direct you to images which
would have been nice but anyways that is
the ask go ahead and ask our final
question so what is the height
requirement for Space Mountain actually
gave us a result of looking for which is
three feet eight inches to write Space
Mountain in Disneyland this one just
does a redirection and of course you
know you'd get your answer right here
because this is getting from same source
of course the answers are different here
but nonetheless you get the idea so
that's pretty much it for this
comparison as you can see overall Google
now is faster both of them were really
accurate you know there are certain
things that the iPhone 5 and Sirica dude
that Google now can't just yet and vice
versa as you guys saw with the last
couple of questions but that's pretty
much it for me in this video if you
