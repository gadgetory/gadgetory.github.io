pixel excel and the LGB 20 are two the
first phones in the world to run Android
nougat out of the box now they have
pretty similar specs outside of a small
difference in their processor so this
speed test like many will come down to
optimization but before we get into it I
want to give a big shout out to
Braintree payments for sponsoring
today's video so developing your own
mobile app can be complex but
integrating your own payment option no
longer has to be with Braintree your
business can accept nearly every type of
payment from any device with just one
integration everything from pesos to
PayPal to Android pay and whatever you
payment option comes next
Braintree simple flexible SDKs make your
job and your payments easier learn more
at Braintree parents comm slash bomba
alright let's get right into it okay so
we'll kick things off by starting the
stopwatch is on each phone where the
Google pixel gets a step over the p20 ad
each phone goes through the first row of
system apps and then move on to the
second row where there's a couple really
lightweight social media apps and then
heavier apps like Photoshop mix and vid
trim Pro where each file will have to
transcode the same exact video file
really putting their processors to the
test
so as the v20 starts working on vid trim
the pixel is just about done and moves
on to the gaming row now it is worth
noting that despite the pixel having the
newer Snapdragon 820 one under the hood
the LG and it's older Snapdragon 820
actually completed a transcoding task at
the same exact rate this is mainly due
to the fact that Google under clocked
the pixels processor in order to be able
to help improve battery life but either
way the pixel is proving to be a bit
faster at initially loading up
applications within now almost a full
app ahead of the V 20 as it finishes
loading flip diving and begins working
on fit the fat now while the V 20 has
dug itself in a bit of a hole there is
still plenty of time for it to make a
comeback with six more apps left here in
the first lap and the full second lap
ahead where the pixel will actually
struggle to keep all the apps ready to
go when it faced off against the iPhone
so it'll be interesting to see if the V
20 can fare any better than it
considering that it has the same four
gigabytes of RAM but before we can find
out what happens
second lab both balls have to finish
loading all the apps here in the first
with a pixel working hard at maintaining
its lead as it moves on to Netflix and
the v20 still one step behind it as it
completes ESPN okay so we're finally
here in the last leg of the first lap
with a pixel loading both mobile and the
full versions of the Amazon website
finishing the first stop at the time of
1 minute and 36 seconds and the b20
finishing seven seconds later with a
time of 1 minute and 43 seconds
so as the pixel has to reload Facebook
the b20 isn't doing itself any favors
having to reload the gallery and even
having to reload the settings so things
not looking so good for either phone
here in the second lap with a pixel
having to reload and actually struggling
with Photoshop mix and the same story
for the b20 with its 4 gigabytes of RAM
also not being able to hold Photoshop
mix in memory but some good news here
for the pixel as it manages to keep
subway surfers open as does the v20
however it fails to keep flip diving
ready whereas the b20 has its and the
rest of the games ready to go taking the
lead for the first time here in this
speed test so with the pixel continuing
to struggle here in the second lap with
it having to reload fit the fats the b20
finishes the speeds as strong with a
time of 2 minutes and 27 seconds with us
fast-forwarding the pixel to the finish
line where it finished 30 seconds later
with a time of 2 minutes and 57 seconds
making the winner for this feat test
that LGB 20 that is it for me in this
video thank you guys for watching and as
always I'll see you in the very next
