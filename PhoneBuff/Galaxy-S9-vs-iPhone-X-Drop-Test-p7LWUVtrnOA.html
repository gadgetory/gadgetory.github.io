months back when Apple launched the
iPhone 10 they said they're using the
strongest class to ever be used in a
smartphone and not to be outdone with a
galaxy s 9 and s 9 plus Samson is using
a new stronger aluminum that will
supposedly help reduce the total amount
of shock that's sent to the glass in the
event of a drop so today we're gonna be
doing a fumble style drop test to see
which one of these companies claims are
true and which one of these phones is
actually more durable but before we get
into it I want to give a big thanks to
tech 21 for sponsoring today's episode
so when we tested tech to anyone's new
range of cases for the Galaxy S 9 plus
they handled the back corner and face
drops like it was nothing
with the s 9 plus still being in perfect
condition text only one uses
scientifically proven impact materials
and innovative design and a rigorous
testing methodology developed by the
National Physical Laboratory to protect
your Galaxy S 9 plus drop after drop you
can pick up the range of cases at your
local Best Buy or by using the links
down below in the description so check
it out alright let's get to the drop
test round number one backdrop in three
two one
the good news is after that backdrop
both phones remain fully functional but
the bad news at least for the Galaxy S
nine is its glass is completely
shattered whereas on the iPhone 10 the
glass back is mostly intact I mean it's
not in perfect condition there is this
tiny little crack that's tough to show
here on camera but it's nothing compared
to the damage on the s9 and seems to
backup Apple's claim abusing the
strongest class on a phone giving it the
easy win in round number one round
number two corner drop three two one
so the corner drop leaves this mark on
both phones however the difference here
is between stainless steel and aluminum
with the iPhone 10 stainless steel band
showing only minor scratches compared to
the much more noticeable scuffs on the
s9 aluminum neither phone has any dents
or anything like that so they both held
up well in that regard but once again
it's an easy win for the iPhone 10 in
round number two round number three face
drop in three two one
after that face drop we get an almost
opposite result from what we saw in the
first round with the essence glass
remaining fully intact
there's no shattering there's no cracks
and a set of a few small little
scratches you would never even know that
this phone was dropped flat on its face
now the iPhone 10 it didn't do too
poorly either its glass didn't shatter
and only suffered cracks along the top
left but compared to the galaxy s 9
there's really no contest and it looks
like Samsung's improvements to the
aluminum housing and a slightly thicker
glass on the front panel really made a
difference giving it the win in round
number three bonus round all right so
this has turned out to be a close one
and with both phones still fully
functional after our 10-point inspection
they move on to the bonus round where
we'll drop each phone up to ten times
from just under five beats last time it
took five bonus drops before the iPhone
10's home gesture stopped working and
while the phone's other features still
technically remain functional not being
able to use a gesture that is needed to
literally unlock the phone forced us to
throw in the towel let's see if the
Galaxy S nine plus can do any better
three two one drop
oh no definitely cracked but obviously
the works camera whoo that front facing
camera that selfie cam that is uh that's
really not usable it's super crack right
there
but rear camera is still working so
let's go on I don't even think it's
there's no way first time it cracked
second time okay it works drop it I feel
like it just gets louder and louder
blast all over the platform screen
Victorino
screen still works so some dimples in
the screen right over here really bad
shattering up across the top adventure
the selfie cam just doesn't even work at
all whoo okay look at that it won't even
switch to the selfie cam that's
interesting well selfie cam is bad and
then I came to switch so at this point I
think the cameras are gone let's see
maybe dial nine-one-one okay so that
still works I still hear the
speakerphone working so we will go on
but it's a it's pretty damn close to
that and you rub it alright did it
survive 10 did it do it I don't know yep
touch screen is still good to go I can
lock it and unlock it which not all
phones can do and while I can't go into
the camera I could dial nine-one-one
which is you know pretty important
alright so the s9 + is able to survive
all 10 bonus drops of course it didn't
retain 100% functionality with the
selfie cam no longer working but the
good news for the s9 is we were able to
finally access the rear cameras through
eight quick shortcuts where we found
that the moving part that enables a
variable aperture is still working just
fine which hopefully is a sign that
it'll be able to hold up with regular
use
over time so with four rounds in the
books it's time to take a look at the
scorecard in the first round we learned
that at least when it comes to the glass
on the back the iPhone tends glass is
actually stronger in the second the
iPhone 10 stainless steel outshines the
s9 is aluminum in the third Samsung's
work on that aluminum and the thicker
glass paid off big time and finally in
the fourth the s9 proves that it can get
hit and keep on going for longer making
this a close one but a hard-earned
victory for the Galaxy S 9 Plus anyways
that is it for me in this video thank
you guys for watching and as always I'll
see you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
