Volvo calm and in this video I'll be
giving you a few of my tips to buying a
used cell phone so the first tip is to
take a full 360 look at the phone making
sure that there isn't any damage or a
lot of damage especially alongside the
corners I mean a few uh you know Nick
snacks are okay but a lot of them
indicate the phone's been dropped a lot
and that will probably not be a good
thing going down the line because you
never know how that affects fall on the
inside you want to make sure the screen
doesn't have access to scratches of
course like scratches or okay as with
any use foam you should expect them but
should it be excessive by any means turn
to the LCD on or the screen on and make
sure that the screen itself isn't
cracked because the cracked screen is no
good and the way you detect whether or
not a screen is cracked is there
shouldn't be any lines running through
the screen or any bleeding of the colors
of course you want to test the screen if
it's touchscreen itself by testing every
single corner so as I'm doing right now
you can see I'm testing every corner to
making sure to make sure that all work
because sometimes you can go home you
know think of the phones working and all
sudden realize that the bottom right
corner doesn't work and I definitely
don't want that to happen so after
you've checked the screen and the phone
itself you want to check the button so
make sure that the volume buttons work
so while you up and down the power key
the camera key and so forth you want to
make sure those things work because a
lot of times you can be you know going
through a phone and not even realize
that those things don't work when I also
make sure that if a phone has a little
like kickstand that it works of course
most phones don't have that but if it
does make sure that thing works properly
and the most important thing you want to
check for though with any use foam is if
the phone has liquid damage because a
lot of times the phone will look good
but it could be liquid damaged and the
way you check for that is looking at the
charging port so in this case you look
right here and make sure that the inside
looks nice and you know aluminum make
sure it's not green or yellow or any
kind of moldy colour which would
indicate corrosion which would be from
liquid damage you can also take a look
at the headphone jack making sure there
is any liquid damage in there the next
thing you want to check for water damage
is the battery itself
because the battery itself level or
indicator that's usually a white sticker
or a white sticker with little pink
design on it but it should be white for
the most part if it's a solid pink or a
solid red means that the phone's been
water damaged and you definitely want to
stay away from there
also you can check inside the device so
you can see in here there's a little
white sticker right there and make sure
that's the same color too because any
other color would indicate that the
phone's been water damaged of course
people can replace the battery tricking
you thinking that it's okay so you want
to check in there and also like I said
the charging port itself but uh that's
the steps you want to take for water
damage tracking but the next thing we'll
check for it is the ESN so if you're on
a or if you're trying to buy a CDMA
phone such as like a Sprint or Verizon
phone you want to make sure that you
call the carrier and verify that the
es10 is free meaning that it isn't
activated on another account which would
indicate a stone phone or if it isn't on
an account that you know has a pasty
payment which they lock the phone from
being used but once you've done those
things and everything checks out you're
probably going to be good to go and
hopefully you can enjoy your new phone
but that's pretty much it for me in this
