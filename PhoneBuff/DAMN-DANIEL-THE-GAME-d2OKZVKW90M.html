back to the second episode of app or
crap where we take a look at random apps
that we come across and let you know if
they deserve a spot on your phone today
we're looking at three different games
the first one is called Kirby late where
you have to make your way up without
hitting any obstacles the second app is
called dan Daniel yeah they made a game
out of that and finally the third app is
called fury where you had a fight with
bears with simple swipes across the
screen and to make things a little bit
more interesting we're gonna have a
little bit of friendly competition so
we're gonna bring in J our creative
director and a little bit of alcohol so
the rules are simple in each game we'll
give ourselves two attempts to get the
highest score that we can and whoever
loses that game will have to take a shot
now to add insult to injury the loser of
the three game series will have to take
a double shot at the end
totaling any possible 5 shots of vodka
in less than an hour let's get started
shall we
alright so attempt number one attempt
number one right here oh yeah oh god
alright
so go go all right uh-huh uh-huh oh no
oh yes
no my god I was so stupid
seven it takes so long for me to have a
No
okay yup so this is my first step right
yeah okay oh my goodness I forgot how
hard to see his I suck at this game I
hate this game
Oh God yeah hi oh this is such a great
and bad idea
thanks thanks barkeep no tips damn
Daniels up next right damn Daniel I
don't know much about damn Daniel as
much as David does I think it's just a
jumping game let's go and start it up oh
man this is actually hard when you have
like a burning throat kind of played it
okay here we go
attempt number one
it lag it lag in the eye so this game is
definitely crap from the get-go because
they lagged on me whatever
damn it
so I already had to take another shot ah
damn David okay alright well I got like
nothing in that one right yeah no see
they if you lose this one get the take
take a third shot and then the double
shot yeah
alright all I gotta do is beat you in
this one 33 one more try
oh man oh my god
hi 33 33 that's not 30 that's 33
Neverland yeah all right so we're not
doing the holding concentration I'm
looking for your shot oh come on
do I have fill yours up that much oh
yeah no wait oh god that's bad
I know I've noticed all right so I hear
your first pack - what is your first
dude shot number one thanks everyone for
watching
there you go sir it does not we should
buy a better alcohol next I'm taking all
this 400 come it's crying inside it all
right so uh Jays in the bathroom
probably throwing up I don't know anyway
I guess what they answer the question
curb you late first game app or crop I
say it's an app what'd he say so now
damn Daniel I see some apps crap yeah no
it does lag a bit and there's a lot of
ads it's like and there's no way to
remove it critical it has ads but you
could actually buy a paid version so
damn do I know right now Martha saves
crap it's going for one day and that
damn Daniel voice gets annoying if when
you hear it all the time
and then finally fury I think it's
pretty pretty safe to say that's an app
alright so we'll be linking the apps for
you down below in the description if you
want to try it you get a high score that
beats ours
tweet it to us but only I like two
attempts guys don't be cheatin playing
all day and trying to show off but
anyways that is it for me and J for this
episode we'll see you guys in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
