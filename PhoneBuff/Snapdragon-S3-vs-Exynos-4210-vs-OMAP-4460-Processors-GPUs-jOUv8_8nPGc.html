of comm and today I'm doing a comparison
between three different processors and
GPUs on three of the top Android
smartphones available today so on the
left you have the HCM a is 4G which is
running a 1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon s3
dual-core processor with the audrina 220
GPU in the middle you have the samsung
galaxy s2 which is running a 1.2
gigahertz Samsung Exynos 4210
2 core processor with the Mallee 400 GPU
and on the right you have the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus which is running a 1.2
gigahertz TI OMAP 4460
dual-core processor with the HDX 540 GPU
alright so I'm gonna be testing each of
these processors and GPUs with Google
Earth so I have each device on the same
Wi-Fi network and I've closed out all
background apps so I'll go ahead and
load up Google Earth on each phone and I
will wait for all three to finish
loading up so I'm not so much interested
in which one actually loads the fastest
I'm more so interested in which one's
gonna be able to handle the 3d buildings
on Google Earth better so I'll go ahead
and load up 3d buildings on each device
so check 3d buildings try three
buildings on the galaxy s 2 and then on
the amaze so it does take a while for
this to load up so I'll go ahead and
skip to about a minute or so until you
guys finish loading and then we'll zoom
in zoom out and see which one performs
best alright so it's been about a minute
or so and I've let each phone load up
the 3d buildings I have them all zoomed
in on one building I think it's the
Bellagio and we'll go ahead and zoom out
and zoom in on each phone to kind of
give you an idea of which one performs
better so I'm going to move out the
Galaxy Nexus and the galaxy s2 and I
will focus on the Amaze for right now
and then show you the other two right
after so I'll go ahead and zoom in and
zoom out so I'll four zoom out so you
can see how choppy it is that's because
there's so much data on this application
so I'm gonna zoom in a little bit
now I'm going to kind of pan around so I
just want to give you an idea as far as
how smooth each phone performs so you
can see you kind of get idea as far as
how smooth the amazes I was assuming a
little bit zoom out one more time and
what I'm do actually is look up at the
building so all right and then zoom out
so hopefully that gives you a better
idea as far as what kind of performance
you'll get with Google Earth with the
audrina 220 and the snapdragon s3
alright so go ahead and bring in the
epic or the galaxy s2 and we'll do the
same thing we'll just zoom in and zoom
out so you get told right off the bat
this one's a little bit smoother than
the Amaze so the echinus and the Mallee
400 I'll go ahead and zoom in and zoom
out from here again and then let's go
and look up at the building alright so
this gives you a better idea it's a lot
smoother than it wasn't the amazed with
the 1.5 gigahertz processor this is the
akeno's 1.2 gigahertz processor with the
Mallee 400 and that's but not least
let's look at the Galaxy Nexus and see
how this got performs so we'll do the
same thing again zoom in and zoom out
and it this one just crashed on me right
now so gives me an idea as far as the
processor in here go ahead and try to
load it up one more time doesn't always
crash actually sometimes it works pretty
good but from my experience the galaxy
s2 is usually the best as far as the
performance goes the Galaxy Nexus with
its TI OMAP 4460
usually doesn't crash on me but
sometimes it has and same with the Amaze
but don't try to load it up one more
time
all right so I've reloaded it and we'll
go ahead and do the zoom in and zoom out
again and this time is performing a lot
better of course I didn't crash but
we'll go ahead and zoom in again and
we'll go ahead and rotate it and we'll
zoom into where it is looking up at the
building so pull this guy that whoops so
hopefully this gives you a better idea
as far as what you'll get with this
processor and GPU so we're zooming up
all right so zoom in and out of here so
um this one did crash when I first
loaded it up and try to do it but right
now it looks a little bit smoother than
the Amaze but you have to consider in
the factor that it did crash on me and
you know the other two devices didn't so
I'm going to press home and I'll show
you what happens when I press home has
to reload pretty much everything on my
home screen like all the widgets and
stuff so let's look at the galaxy s2 and
see what happens so I'll just zoom in
and zoom out again really quick so zoom
in zoom out we'll press home and
everything that's already loaded so I
didn't have to reload the home screen
and then we'll get the amazed with the
Snapdragon processor and again we'll
zoom in and zoom out alright
press home and I didn't have to reload
the home screen widgets and whatnot so
it gives you a better idea as far as the
point to get I'll say in first place is
the galaxy s2 I'll put the amazing
second player because it didn't crash
and you know didn't have to reload the
home screen even though to the
performance-wise the Galaxy Nexus did a
little bit better with the TI OMAP 4460
but those are the results alright that's
it for me in this video this Dave form
of comm thank you for watching video and
don't forget to visit for more calm for
more cellphone news reviews and how-to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
