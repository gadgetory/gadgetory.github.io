and in this video be doing a review on
the samsung galaxy note 10.1 tablet I'm
really excited to do this review because
this is arguably one of the best spec
tablets if not the best spec tablet to
ever hit android but before actually go
into what I like and what I dislike I
want to give you guys a quick hardware
tour so on the front of the device you
obviously you have the screen which is
10.1 inches and given the fact that the
name is galaxy note 10.1 that's not
really a surprise the resolution is 800
x 1280 it's a TFT display and on the top
of the screen you have a 1.9 microsoft
front-facing camera similar to what you
see on the samsung galaxy s3 on the left
and on the right you have speaker grill
so it's nice to have dual speakers got
your Samsung logo here at the bottom on
the back of the tablet you have your
samsung level again 5 megapixel camera
with LED flash got your typical little
logos for Wi-Fi and 16 gigabytes
considering this is a 16 gigabyte model
on the left bottom left you have your S
Pen so you can just pull this guy out
and you see the Samsung logo got your
physical button right there which gives
you a whole bunch of different input
methods and also your S Pen tip which is
a pressure-sensitive so go ahead and
snap this guy back into place you guys
can see it's really firmly in there I'm
it's not gonna fall out or anything so
don't worry about that if you're
considering getting this guy on the top
of the device you have a power button
volume rocker follow up down micro SD
card slot you have a infrared signal and
then you have your 3.5 million headset
jack as expected on the bottom you have
your charging port and microphone and
that's pretty much it on the left and on
the right there's absolutely nothing and
that's pretty much it for the outside of
device on the inside you have a 1.4
Gertz a keynote for quad processor so
basically it's a quad core processor
with not one but two gigabytes of RAM
and obviously that explains why i said
this is the best spec android tablet
I've ever seen at least and you know
with 2gb RAM with a quad-core you know
it's going to be giving you great
performance but we'll get into a little
bit later as far as the rest of the
internals you have a seven thousand
million
battery and the device itself is not all
that heavy in only weighs about 600
grams so let's go ahead and go into the
review I'll first talk about the things
that I dislike and then I'll talk about
things that I think are just ok and then
finally I'll finish up with what I like
because I do love ending my reviews with
a positive note so with that sense go
ahead and get right into it also the
first thing that I dislike about the
galaxy note 10.1 is the build quality
now it's not necessarily the way it
looks I think it's a pretty sleek
looking device I especially like the
back I mean it kind of reminds me of a
lot I mean looks like a laptop to me
when you have it down like this but that
what I talk about build quality is kind
of a you know what most people complain
about as far as you know Samsung devices
in the past basically it's kind of
plastic II and I've never really you
know said anything bad about it in my
reviews for samsung phones but on this
tablet it really seems to make a
difference because i'll go ahead and
like kind of move it around and you can
actually hear it squeaks oh i'll try to
be quiet so you guys can hear it so i
don't know if that comes through on
camera hopefully does but take my word
on it it does squeak and i don't want my
five hundred or tablet squeak and sound
like a little plastic toy so that's a
downside I mean really it's probably not
that big of a deal maybe the you know
plastic material makes it you know more
resistant to getting damaged when you
drop it I don't know but anyway that's
one of the first thing is just like
second thing I dislike is the fact that
Samsung opted not to use a micro USB
charging port we have this Samsung
charging port so kind of suds
considering you know I have an android
phone I have you know a bunch of Android
devices or micro USB devices nowadays
because considering it's a standard and
the fact that this doesn't use it you
know it kind of makes it inconvenient to
take a whole nother charger with me you
know whenever I go out to places so
that's something that you know really
wish Samson would have included it but
you know I know there they went with
this for a bunch of reasons but
nonetheless I would have liked to see
that and the last thing that I dislike
is the fact that the galaxy note 10.1
doesn't have NFC capability i mean my
galaxy s3 has NFC capability and i'd
like to be able to beam things you know
to and from each of these devices and
the fact that doesn't have it really
isn't fortunate so anyway those are the
three things that i dislike and i'll see
that's not all
that bad considering that it's only
three but let's go ahead and talk about
you know what I think is just okay and
then we'll go into what I like all right
so what I think is just okay it's not
necessarily bad but I wouldn't consider
something that's good is the screen yeah
it's 10.1 inches it's nice and as you
guys can see it's pretty bright however
I feel like the resolution just isn't
all that high especially considering the
price point five hundred dollars is
expecting a better resolution screen at
800 x 1280 you know it's really not that
high i mean it's the same resolution you
see on the Nexus 7 which is a 7-inch
tablet this is a 10.1 inch tablet so the
ppi's can be even lower the ppi on this
guy is 149 so I'm a I'm getting you know
double that on my galaxy nexus on my
galaxy s three as far as the quality and
this kind of something I wish that they
would have done better now I'm not going
to complain i'll go ahead and show you a
little video that samsung included which
does kind of demonstrate the screen
quality so it's not that big of deal s
why i didn't put it as something that i
dislike let me go ahead and find the
gallery really quick there it is all
right so you guys could check this video
out um kind of impressed me so maybe
it'll impress you i'll go ahead and
fast-forward maybe so it is a little
demonstration as far as the screen
claudine you guys see it looks really
really nice um just which was better i
mean i don't know i couldn't expect it a
little bit higher resolution but like i
said it's not going to hinder your
experience 149 ppi isn't all that bad
screen is really bright the TFT display
and as you guys can see from this video
it you know isn't something horrible so
that's why i say something that's okay
um the next thing that I'd say is just
okay is the front and rear cameras I
mean it's a tablet I don't really care
all that much about the camera on the
front actually isn't that bad is one
point I make whistles but on the back
it's really the one that you know isn't
good at all I mean it's five megapixels
it's I I was kind of expecting it to be
kind of like the one we saw on the
galaxy nexus with five mixels but it's
not this guy doesn't really shoot video
although i'm gonna upload a video sample
on the channel to check that out but it
doesn't record in 1080p it's only 720p
which is definitely something that I
dislike in consider like I said this is
five hundred dollars i just kind of
accept
a little bit more um kind of feel like
it's made it you know fee it makes the
tablet feel a little more overpriced
when considering those two factors
anyway that's what I think is ok but you
know like I said it's not bad it's not
good just okay let's go ahead and talk
about what is good and why you'd want to
get this tablet over the others all
right so let's go ahead and talk about
what I like about this happen because I
know that's what you guys been waiting
for and honestly there's a lot to like
first thing that I really like and what
I feel like makes it stand out from any
other tablet on the market is the S Pen
so I'll go ahead and pull it out and
notice that this little dog opens up on
the right and basically these are S Pen
specific applications like s no s
planner which basically calendar crayon
physics you have photoshop touch and
florists office go ahead and open up s
pen and show you a little bit about you
know this application I did a full-on
review and in-depth you know walkthrough
on the channel so if you guys want to
learn more about it check that out but
i'll go ahead and show you some of the
features on here so one with the s pen
with the pressure sensitivity I could do
you know I could draw lightly and make
little lines I could push a little bit
harder make bold lines I could you know
switch what kind of utensil amuses right
now it's a pen I could use a brush so
for example if I want to do a brush I
can do light little strokes I can do
dark strokes like that really cool makes
it feel like you're actually holding a
actual paint brush in your hand you're
actually using you know a memo pad or a
piece of paper um now the cool feature
over here on the right is S Pen only
modes basically right now can use my
finger if I tap this my finger doesn't
work and what's great about that is
because if I'm using my hand and putting
my you know resting my palm down on the
screen it's not gonna affect my palm is
only going to check the s pen which
really is what you'd expect you know
when you're using actual piece of paper
your your palm is it going to you know
put ink on the paper but the pen will so
that's a cool feature like I said you
have a whole bunch of different you know
options here as far as utensils you have
different strokes that you do as well we
here on the right but that's pretty much
that you can also change the colors what
I really want to show you though is the
productivity tools which I find really
really cool basically the first thing
you can do is right here it's called
formula match so basically what i can do
is let's say I'm in you know algebra or
pre-algebra handa will do x plus
five equals 20 and I want to solve for x
right it translates you know my
handwriting to text right over here I
just hit Search and it's going to
actually search wolframalpha for my
solution so you can see x plus 5 is
equal 20 get a bar or a little graph
yeah you get an alternative form of
writing it and then you get the answer x
equals 15 now where was this you know
when we're in school or when I was in
school you know some of you guys are
obviously still in school and this is a
great taught me not for you know
cheating or you know having this do your
homework but if you really can't figure
something else it's a great way to help
you you know and helps you figure things
out and get the solution if the answer
isn't in the answer key so while we're
here we'll go ahead and talk about the
what is it called multiple window mode
basically what you have here is two
screens you can see I have my notepad
still open and I could actually still
use it and I have my browser open it's
not just Wolfram Alpha I could actually
go to you know any website i want so
I'll go to phone buff and you guys can
see phone book is rendering in the
background i'm still using this little
bit of light because i want to figure
out you know which screen i'm actually
or what side of the screen i'm actually
using but yes see i could use you know
phone book i can zoom in and out go to a
different article if i want and continue
using you know the s no application here
so for example if i'm taking notes on
something i could do that I'm right
handed so I'm not going to be able to do
on the left I guess it switches to the
right really cool functionality and this
is thanks to the processing power in the
ram they find on the galaxy note 10.1
you know otherwise it would be lagging
like crazy so this really shows you the
power go ahead and close out of here um
you know a few different things you
actually so it's actually called
multi-screen I don't know what I called
earlier but you could open up your
internet browser like we just did your
video player Polaris Office your gallery
and email we want to do video player
really quick while we're here and for
example let's say I wanted to take notes
on this video which i showed you earlier
I could do that you know I don't have to
use this I can just go back to regular
pen mode and take my notes as I wish and
really cool to be able to do that you
know while there's a video playing and
that this kind of is a sign of you know
how powerful this tablet so anyway well
go ahead and close out of here so i just
hit X really quick
so whatever side of the window you get
ice on it closes that while we're here
also i'll show you that you can tap this
guy right here and basically it takes
your video player and makes it a little
window and you can continue using you
know your web browser or whatever you
were doing before and still be watching
the video so again really shows you how
powerful you know the tablet is but i
believe the galaxy s3 has this feature
as well so um doesn't need all that much
power but really cool feature with
TouchWiz and honest as the secondary
like so other than the s pen and the S
optimized apps I really like touch was
because I feel like you know they add a
lot of value to the user experience that
you normally wouldn't get so I'm going
to close out of this video we're going
to hit stop I'm just going to hit home
um speaking of you know TouchWiz one
thing you'll notice over here is you
have your back home multitasking window
and you have your app screen right over
here but let's say for example I wanted
to hit here you would think it's your
regular ass but it's not these are your
little pop-up windows they could
actually so we used the video player
earlier and you could actually do
different things like for example I can
open up the calculator here and you know
follows for example in my estimate
application trying to figure out that
same algebra you know problem that was
on and how to use my calculator I could
actually do it while I'm in you know
this note so I could write that or I can
go over here use s note and use this guy
can move it around and continue using
the notepad I could set it down all the
way over here if I wanted to and if i
want to go to the main calculator app
i'll just tap the store arrow and it
goes right into it so really cool
functionality it works with you know the
music player s planner so you have a
little calendar your task manager world
clock and there's different ways to get
it there's a lot of shortcuts so for
example if I want to get it 2 2 s note
for example I don't have to go to
through the dock which you know I don't
think it's on here because I took it off
well you can edit hit edit and then add
it like that so anyway I don't have to
actually go through there I can actually
press the physical button on the S Pen
double tap the screen and it's going to
show up so I don't think it registered
it there you go so you guys can see same
idea you have your little pop-up window
you could use the application but if you
want for example if I wanted my
task manager instead of going here I
could just press and hold on home and it
brings my task manager app open i could
close all the app so let's go ahead and
do that right now so we'll go ahead and
all you guys can see close it out see
how much ram i have so 89 out of one
point seven eight available a bunch of
ram available you're probably never
going to use it all up right here you
guys notice the bottom you have a
screenshot button which basically you
press it you can take screenshots of
course if i wanted to use the S Pen like
I said earlier press and hold the screen
and take screenshots that way too so
there's multiple ways to do things on
the galaxy note 10.1 really cool
functionality TouchWiz is you know
something i like a lot on here because
like i said adds value things like you
know you're able to hide applications
are you're able to uninstall
applications and books so for example if
i wanted to install some apps i just do
it like that i mean really really easy
to uninstall applications I go out of
that mode I wanted to hide some
applications like this for example you
know what I don't use the screensaver
app and world clock hit done boom it's
gone I'm not uninstall it maybe it won't
let me uninstall it but at least I could
hide it and if you want to learn more
about touch woods check out the in-depth
review that I did I did on the galaxy s3
but pretty much getting the same
features here on the galaxy note 10.1
will go on and talk about the next thing
I like and that it's the infrared sensor
the infrared sensor is really cool to
have one here because there's
application pre-loaded which is called
peel they call it smart remote and
basically what this does is it you go to
your TV as long as it's supported and
you pretty much set it up and it's
really easy all you do is turn off the
TV you opens up and say turn on my TV
and automatically like scan through all
its little codes it'll turn the key box
is gonna turn on it yes and basically
control your TV from your tablet with
the infrared I just like it was the
remote and also you can control your
cable box so i have universe i set it up
with my uverse and i'm able to you know
go to my whole TV guide on here and then
change your channel so really nice
application really cool that they added
that future it really you know opens up
the opportunity or capability of the
tablet I want to be doing a video on
that showing you how to set it up in a
quick little review so check that out in
channel as well um next thing that I'm
really
happy about with the galaxy no tempo and
I you know when I almost think Samsung
floor is thank you for this micro SD
card slot because i feel like the
general trend lately has been not to
include these the fact is I has it is
also because I could know it's a 16
gigabyte model here to hire one but 60
gigabytes I could add a 32 gigabyte card
here which i can probably get a lot
cheaper than trying to get the higher
model and I have forty eight gigabytes
total which is awesome if I run our room
I get swapped at 32 gigabytes and you
know carry a few of them on me really
awesome feature I have next thing that I
like is the speaker positioning I mean
Samsung really seem to listen to us and
put the speakers on the front mean why
do you really need speakers in the back
or on the bottom when you're using your
tablet you're looking at it you know
like this you your face is facing the
tablet so why not have these speakers
pointing at you so that way the sound
you know is louder and not only you know
as a speaker position great which makes
you know the audio experience better but
the speakers are actually good
themselves to you know a lot of tablets
you know for example the nexus 7 doesn't
have that kind of speaker sound that
you'd expect this guy definitely isn't
like that it has a loudspeaker you don't
need any applications to amplify it it
gets the job done and that considering
it on the front you don't even need that
a lot of a speaker anyway so that's the
next thing that I like um that's pretty
much it i mean everything else I mean
you're familiar with as far as Android
tablets I mean you're gonna love it out
before the tablet experience but those
are the things I feel like make the
galaxy note 10.1 stand out overall I
have to give this tablet a thumbs up I
mean I kind of feel like it's a little
bit overpriced I wish to the price a
little bit lower considering there's
other options out in the market with you
no higher resolution screens like the
iPad which offer you know different
things with the same kind of processing
power but you know the s-pen experience
really really is what's really going to
make you want to get this tab over
another I said really three times
because I meant it i mean the S if you
like the S Pen you feel if you're
looking for a tablet that you can
actually work on and right and you're
looking for a tablet that's going to
help you with school for example or a
tablet that you going to be able to take
a lot of notes on this is it because it
really gives you almost like a lifelike
experience for us you know writing on a
piece of paper and like I showed you can
help you with your math homework can
help you draw shapes I you get if you're
not comfortable typing your right and
it'll kind
to text whole bunch of features having
Photoshop over here did a falling review
being able to edit your pictures on
Photoshop Touch which is preloaded by
the way normally this thing cost 999 you
get for free with the galaxy note 10.1
editing photos isn't all that easy
especially even on the computer you know
using the mouse it's not that easy to
follow you know for example if I'm
editing this or it's not easy to follow
uh his nose or whatever with the mouse
but with your pen it's really easy to do
and you're able to edit it you know just
like you want so if I wanted to make it
I look like that could do that and it's
really accurate the S Pen so just the
you know overall thumbs up for it so far
oh I forgot to mention this last thing
which which is what I like is the power
the power of the galaxy no tempo like I
said the processor the quad core 1.4
it's icky knows you have to give us ram
I mean you're gonna get better
performance on this tablet than most
tablets out there I did speed
comparisons with the nexus 7 8 beat that
out I did benchmarks on this guy and the
benchmark just blow everything out of
the water I didn't compare some of the
ipad and that is the performance
actually pretty much the same on those
two tablets but if you look at the
benchmarking when this guy gets jelly
bean it's gonna blow everything out of
the water I mean it has the hardware to
do it so I'm really excited about that
like i said though if you're gonna
consider getting it you consider the
pros and cons that i mentioned earlier
what's important to you how important is
the S Pen and also you know do you feel
like you know for five hundred dollars
it's worth it because like I said some
things you know don't reek of you know
or don't you really make you feel like
it's a five-hundred-dollar tablet like
the squeaky call build quality the
you're not so high resolution on the
screen things like that but anyway
that's it for me in this review just
wanted to give you guys you know my
experience with the tablet want to give
you my likes and dislikes if you found
it helpful in any way please hit the
like button and subscribe to the channel
and again check out all those other
videos that it did with the galaxy note
10.1 because this give you a lot better
idea as far as whether or not you this
is the tablet for you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
