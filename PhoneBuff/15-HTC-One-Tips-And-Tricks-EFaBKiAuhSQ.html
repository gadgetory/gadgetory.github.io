and you know I've been using the HTC One
as my main phone for a while now so I
wanted to share with you guys some of
the cool little tips and tricks that you
may not have known about that I've
learned along the way so without any
further ado let's go ahead and get right
into my top 15 tips and tricks on the
HTC One all right so my first tip is to
tap the notification bar to scroll to
the top of whatever HTC app you're
looking at so for example it works in
the settings it works in your phone app
to scroll through your contacts and
maybe most importantly it works in
blinkfeed where the list could actually
get really long tip number two has to do
is scrolling as well but this time it's
scrolling with two fingers to help you
find what you're looking for so for
example and the messaging app it lets
you scroll by the date because that's
how text threads are ordered whereas in
your contacts it lets you scroll by the
letter to help make finding the contacts
you're looking for a whole lot easier
number three is using the volume keys to
control certain apps if your version of
the one came with the HTC flashlight you
can use the volume rocker to change the
light intensity and on the remote app
you can use the volume rockers to
control unsurprisingly enough your TV's
volume while you can use the volume
rocker for apps like the ones I just
mentioned unfortunately you can't use
them to capture photos in the camera app
you can however with tip number four
capture an image by pressing anywhere on
the screen instead of trying to find the
shutter button by going into the camera
settings and then shutter options and
then finally checking the touch to
capture mode but if that isn't enough
trick number five is the fact that you
can use your Bluetooth headset to
capture photos by pressing on the call
button while connected of course if you
don't like to touch your capture option
and you don't carry a Bluetooth headset
around with you all the time you can
always use that wide angled front facing
camera and with tip number six you can
switch back and forth to it pretty
easily by simply swiping your finger
across the screen in either direction
since we're talking about the camera tip
number seven is to use continuous
shooting now you probably already knew
that the HTC One had this feature where
you press and hold on the shutter button
to take a series of pictures but you
might not have known about tip number 8
which is unlocking the continuous
shooting limit so you can take up to 99
pictures at a time to help ensure you
capture those Kodak moments
but I've got to warn you taking down
many pictures all the time will drain
your battery pretty good so tip number 9
is to use the power saver mode when
you're not really using your phone
heavily I actually use this all day on
the days when I know I won't have access
to a charger until late at night power
saver lowers your cpu frequency it
reduces your screens brightness turns
off vibration and puts your data
connection to sleep when the screen is
off which really does help conserve your
battery life tip number 10 is hiding
apps you can do this by swiping down in
the app drawer and hitting the Settings
button and then the height apps button
checking off the apps that you don't
need or use frequently leaves you with
only the ones that you do which makes
things a lot easier to find on a
day-to-day basis number 11 is similar to
tip number 10 in the sense that it helps
make your phone more efficient by hiding
and reordering things a little bit in
the phone app simply press the menu
button and then edit tabs where you'll
be able to uncheck the tabs that you
don't want to see and reorder the ones
that you do you can do the same thing in
the clock app but note that you can only
hide certain tabs like the stopwatch and
timer in this example tip number 12 is
something that most of you probably
already know which is how to take
screenshots but just in case you don't I
want to go over it really quick so
there's actually two ways to do it on
the HTC One the fastest way is holding
the power button while simultaneously
pressing the home button however in my
experience it isn't the most accurate
way which to me is holding the power
button and the volume down key at the
same time it takes a few extra seconds
to capture but for me it works a lot
better ok we're almost there tip number
13 is customizing your LED notifications
go into the settings and then display
and tap on notification flash from here
you'll be able to pick and choose which
notifications you want your LED light to
flash for tip number 14 is one that I
really like and that's enabling the
magnifier glass turning text selection
to do this go into the phone's main
settings and then accessibility from
here find the show magnifier option and
check it this will enable a little
magnification window when you're
selecting text which for me makes it a
lot easier to be precise when copying
and pasting now before I go over this
last trick I want to tip you off to
something and that's that there's more
tips and tricks to be found in the
article on phone book com which can be
found in the link right below that like
button of this video alright so the
final tip for this
assuming that you're using the stock HTC
keyboard is calibrating it to improve
its accuracy the way you do this is go
into the settings once again this time
tap on language and keyboard choose HTC
Sense input tap on advanced and hit that
calibration tool option the phone will
ask you to type a sentence like you
normally would and it maps where your
fingers naturally land to help me you
can input a little bit more accurate
okay that's pretty much it for me in
this video if you found it helpful if
you liked it please give a thumbs up and
