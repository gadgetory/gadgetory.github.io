something you love like music was
something you can't live without like
water
this happens does that pause on purpose
kind of yes this is a water bottle or
just a bottle combined with a Bluetooth
speaker here you go
on the back to in one bottle speaker
with bottle access boat lay speaker
support lay speaker where do I find this
stuff battery life class a high-capacity
battery 650 milliamps that right off the
bat waterproof design sound quality
other stuff we'll go ahead and open it
up got a micro USB cable for charging it
I assume plastic bottle itself really
lightweight actually so this is
obviously something that you're gonna
want to take with you on the go Oh on
the bottom of the product itself
you got your controls got your power
button play button volume down and up
right here you've got a little flap that
protects your micro USB ports and that
looks like a little SD card but an SD
card okay
does yeah - motor hold on - motor of
playing bluetooth mode derp or there TF
card mode which I don't know what a TF
card is I'm assuming it's like a micro
SD card that's what it looks like got
your little boo it's a little cup 200 -
compass north guys anytime you see a
video now you guys aw and you can see a
phone book video you know that North is
literally that way just slightly off
camera it's okay it's pointing at J
North is pointing at J
I am sure no anyway it's a little cup
you know so you put tea in here
wait speaking of tea is this tea I mean
dude you smell it it smells like pee up
it's tea
it says ours looked on sick you can't
save a non-toxic deodorant do not eat
non-toxic deodorant well why did it just
like yeah it smells like too much get
the cup right here see if this comes out
and it does who look that speaker itself
right there rather you got the speaker
you know that's the worst habit I have a
guy everyone was younger when ever to
see a speaker those exposed like this
like without the grill I'd always like
push it like as a button and it stays
stuck um enough talking about it right
time to test it got a water bottle yeah
yeah imagine okay your mother here move
little micro USB cable let's turn this
thing on
pair it to my phone enter your Bluetooth
I like that voice I don't know which one
it is I'm guessing is this 2 6 4 1 root
2 is connected bird tooth connected
that's what I heard this play this play
just like song that sounds like Soulja
Boy that I use a speed test sometimes
Wow all right
first impressions based off that sound
mi know you guys are hearing it through
the mic and you guys aren't getting the
full effect it's small but it sounds
freaking great I mean not great great it
sounds like pretty much like a like a
dedicated Bluetooth speaker that you'd
get maybe even a little bit better I had
some had some thud to it right the bass
let's try one more song cuz that sounded
good whatever
I don't think girl Ryu use the song it's
louder yeah this is where the sound is
escaping right here no no oh wait this
is lighting a blue so you get this
little blue light I'm assuming like any
Bluetooth accessory blue means you're
good well I probably gonna start
flashing red when the battery levels get
low this thing is actually made for an
active lifestyle you could take it
around put it in your bike rides you got
your water maybe Gatorade whatever you
want I think I got it on Amazon for like
25 bucks I'll buy it I'll buy it again I
in fact actually I'd buy it for as a
gift for a lot of people that like music
and like our active the battery size is
a little small like 650 milliamps or
something like that so it's alright not
gonna last longest damn this is freaking
cool give your bike a sound system and a
friggin drink at the same time you'll
hook up your bike I don't have a bike
now I won't when I'm gonna buy a bike I
guess that's pretty much all there is to
say about this little gadget
I'm impressed by oh actually you know
what one thing we haven't done can you
use the cup so what what's the point of
this though what's the point of this
maybe it's for more than just water you
know pouring like vodka in there it's a
little shot glass that's the only thing
I can think of all right guys um that is
it for me in this video I actually like
this product I'm gonna put a link for
you guys down below in the
description sound quality's good uh hold
you freakin water gives your bike a
upgrade gives your your backpack an
upgrade look at that it swims alright
guys thank you guys for watching if you
liked it give it a big thumbs up to show
you love and as always I'll catch you
the next one I'm gonna patiently wait
for the air to turn off so Kevin Durant
sure the cancer Lakers Kevin Durant if
you're watching if you're watching this
video there's still time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
