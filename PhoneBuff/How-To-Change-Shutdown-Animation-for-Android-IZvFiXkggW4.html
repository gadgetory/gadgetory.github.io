today I'll be doing a video on how to
switch out your shut down animation on
your phone so in order to be able to do
that you are going to need to have root
explorer and in order to be able to root
use root explorer you're going to need
to have to be rooted so make sure your
phone is rooted and download root
explorer from the android market if you
haven't already and with that said let's
go into how to actually do it so you're
going to open up blue tips for you want
to go to the root folder of your phone
so you can see at the top bar there's a
slash nothing behind it that means you
have the root if there's something
behind this slash it means you're in a
folder you want to back out of it and
tell you about the very root of your
phone so once you do that what you want
to do is you want to go in to where you
downloaded the shutdown animation so I
put my on an animation on my SD
card so I'll go ahead and find that
shutdown animation here it is basically
the shutdown animations is a bunch of
pictures that the phone will
automatically you know go through when
it shuts down so I'm just going to
select all so I hit menu multi select
and then select all and i'ma hit copy
and from here you want to go back to the
root like I was telling you guys earlier
and go to the system folder so system
and from the system folder you want to
find the media folder and I should look
like this in the top say system slash in
on media might be named something else
depending on your phone but it should be
somewhat similar if not the same so go
into video after I go into the media
folder and from here you see is this a
shutdown
click on that and this is my old
shredder animation it's actually the
same one because someone I like I don't
want to replace it but I'm just showing
you guys how to do it so I'm just going
to hit select all so and then delete so
it's kind of delete and now you want you
want to hit paste and it's going to
paste the one that you're copying over
from your SD card and um that's it it's
as simple as that you're just going to
need to probably do a quick reset on
your phone or if a will are in order for
it to actually work but um it's pretty
much it's something really easy to do
alright thank you for watching the video
