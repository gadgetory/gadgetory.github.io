fumble calm and in this video i'm gonna
try to answer a question a lot of guys
when asked me lately and that's which
phone is better between the samsung
galaxy s3 and the LG nexus 4 and
honestly it's a really tough question
answer because both phones are great
both have their pros and cons and both
our flagship devices the galaxy s3 is
Samsung's flagship the Nexus 4 is google
slide ship and they both bring a lot of
different things to the table but
ultimately there is one phone that's
better for you between the two and I
can't really say you know one is better
than the other for everybody because
ultimately comes down to personal
preference but in this video we're going
to find out just what phone it is that
you would want Adam to we'll start off
this head-to-head between the galaxy s3
and the Nexus 4 by comparing the build
quality and design of each phone the
galaxy s3 has a polycarbonate body and
is available in pebble blue white red
and even black depending on your carrier
the s3 is both lighter and thinner than
the nexus 4 and because of this and it's
curved design it's a little bit easier
to hold in the hand the nexus 4 in the
other hand currently only comes in black
but it does feel like a more premium
phone than the s3 because of both a soft
touch material on its edges and the
gorilla glass covered front and back so
when it comes to looks and design I
don't think you could go wrong with
either phone the s3 gives you more color
choices and feels better in the hand
while the nexus 4 feels more premium and
has a sleek black look we've gone to
love from nexus devices now let's talk
screens both devices have beautiful HD
displays with the galaxy s3 having a
four-point eight inch Super AMOLED
display with 1280 by 720 resolution and
the nexus for having a 4.7 inch IPS
display with a resolution of 1280 by 768
the advantages of the s3 screen are
because it doesn't have on-screen
buttons like the Nexus 4 you get to see
your content in 720p all the time and
it's super amoled display gives you
super deep blacks and helps conserve
battery life the advantages of the Nexus
4 screen is that it has a higher PPI
which stands for pixels per inch and
unlike the galaxy s3 it doesn't share
sub pixels which helps the overall
quality of the screen I really like the
true 720p experience and the deep blacks
you get on the galaxy s3 but at the same
time I like the sharper and brighter
screen on the next
or a little bit more but just like with
the design this one could actually come
down to personal preference how about
battery life well both phones have 20
100 milli amp batteries and everything
else being equal they should perform
about the same but the thing is
everything else isn't equal with its
energy efficient screen along with
Samsung's Colonel optimizations the
galaxy s three last about seven to eight
percent longer than the nexus 4 does on
an average days use on top of that the
galaxy s3's battery is removable giving
it the clear advantage in this category
so which phone performs better first off
I want to let you know that both phones
are really fast and each has more than
enough power to get the job done the
galaxy s3 has either a dual core
Snapdragon s4 with two gigs of RAM or an
ex-analyst for quad with one gig
depending on the model and the Nexus 4
has just one version with a quad-core s4
pro coupled with two gigabytes of RAM as
expected with the newer hardware the
nexus 4 is faster and booting up opening
applications and loading websites giving
it the advantage in the performance
category both phones have 8 megapixel
cameras with LED flash but just like
with the battery the specs here don't
tell the whole story from my experience
the galaxy s3 takes better quality
photos with more accurate colors and
seems not to need a steady of hands to
capture a clear shot features wise the
galaxy s3's camera has a little bit more
with things like birdshot and photo
filters the nexus 4 does however have
the new 360 panorama mode that came with
android 4.2 which is pretty awesome but
then again the s3 will probably get that
feature too when it gets updated to 4.2
somewhere down the line so when it comes
to the cameras the edge goes to the
galaxy s3 call quality is about the same
on both phones when using tmobile but
there is a noticeable difference in the
speakers you be the judge of which one
is better while I play the same song on
each phone
as you can see or hear in this case the
s3 speaker is louder than the nexus 4
especially when laying on its back so
again the galaxy s3 gets the win in this
category on the software side of things
the galaxy s3 has Samsung's TouchWiz UI
over top of Android which includes nice
little features like wireless toggles
smart stay and smart rotation which use
the front-facing camera to control the
screen and motion controls which allow
you to do things like swiping your palm
will cross the screen to take a
screenshot and a whole bunch more but
it's the software on the nexus 4 that
really draws you to the phone being a
Nexus device it runs Android the way
Google envisioned it to be and you'll
pretty much be one version of Android
ahead of the galaxy s3 and other non
Nexus devices most of the time so you'll
get to enjoy the latest and greatest
from google at least a couple of months
before everybody else does like some of
the other categories this again comes
down to personal preference well I like
the value add ons TouchWiz brings to the
galaxy s3 I also like the pier google
experience and the super fast updates
you get on the nexus 4 the last thing
we'll take a look at our notable
features on each phone unlike the nexus
for the galaxy s3 has full 4g LTE
support it has a physical home button
which keeps you from accidentally
pressing at times it has an expandable
microSD card slot and it supports OTG
and MHL output unlike the galaxy s3 the
nexus 4 supports qi wireless charging
which means you can finally ditch the
wire completely and the slippery display
let your fingers easily glide across the
screen which is great for gaming so
there you have it that's our breakdown
of the galaxy s3 in the Nexus 4 like we
said in the beginning of the video both
phones have the pros and cons and
deciding on which phone is best for you
isn't just a matter of adding them up
but it's also looking at which pros and
cons are most important to you alright
