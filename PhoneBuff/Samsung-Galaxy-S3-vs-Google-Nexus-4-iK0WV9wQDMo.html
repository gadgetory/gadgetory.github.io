fumble calm and in this video I'm gonna
try to answer a question a lot of guys
would ask me lately and that's which
phone is better between the Samsung
Galaxy s3 and the LG Nexus 4 and
honestly it's a really tough question to
answer because both phones are great
both have the pros and cons and both are
flagship devices the Galaxy s3 is
Samsung's flagship the Nexus 4 is
Google's flagship and they both bring a
lot of different things to the table but
ultimately there is one phone that's
better for you between the two and I
can't really say you know one is better
than the other for everybody because
ultimately comes down to personal
preference but in this video we're gonna
find out just what phone it is that you
would want add them to we'll start off
this head-to-head between the Galaxy s3
and the Nexus 4 by comparing the build
quality and design of each phone the
Galaxy s3 has a polycarbonate body and
is available in pebble blue white red
and even black depending on your carrier
the s3 is both lighter and thinner than
the Nexus 4 and because of this and it's
curved design it's a little bit easier
to hold in the hand the Nexus 4 on the
other hand currently only comes in black
but it does feel like a more premium
phone than the s3 because of both a soft
touch material on its edges and the
Gorilla Glass covered front and back so
when it comes to looks and design I
don't think you could go wrong with
either phone
the s3 gives you more color choices and
feels better in the hand while the Nexus
4 feels more premium and has a sleek
black look we've gone to love from Nexus
devices now let's talk screens both
devices have beautiful HD displays with
the galaxy s3 having a 4.8 inch Super
AMOLED display with 1280 by 720
resolution and the Nexus 4 having a 4.7
inch IPS display with the resolution of
1280 by 768 the advantages of the s3
screen are because it doesn't have
on-screen buttons like the Nexus 4 you
get to see your content in 720p all the
time and it's Super AMOLED display gives
you super deep blacks and helps conserve
battery life the advantages of the nexus
4 screen is that it has a higher ppi
which stands for pixels per inch and
unlike the galaxy s3 it doesn't share
sub pixels which helps the overall
quality of the screen I really like the
true 720p experience and the deep blacks
you get on the galaxy s3 but at the same
time I like the sharper and brighter
screen on the Nexus
or a little bit more but just like with
the design this one could actually come
down to personal preference
how about battery life well both phones
have 20 100 milli amp batteries and
everything else being equal they should
perform about the same but the thing is
everything else isn't equal with its
energy-efficient screen along with
Samsung's kernel optimizations the
galaxy s3 lasts about seven to eight
percent longer than the Nexus 4 does on
an average days use on top of that the
galaxy s3s battery is removable giving
it the clear advantage in this category
so which phone performs better first off
I want to let you know that both phones
are really fast and each has more than
enough power to get the job done the
galaxy s3 has either a dual-core
Snapdragon s4 with 2 gigs of RAM or an
ex-analyst 4 quad with 1 gig depending
on the model and the nexus 4 has just
one version with a quad core s4 pro
couple of with two gigabytes of RAM as
expected with the newer hardware the
Nexus 4 is faster in booting up opening
applications and loading websites giving
it the advantage in the performance
category both phones have eight
megapixel cameras with LED flash but
just like with the battery the specs
here don't tell the whole story from my
experience the galaxy s3 takes better
quality photos with more accurate colors
and seems not to need a steady of hands
to capture a clear shot features wise
the galaxy s3 camera has a little bit
more with things like bersia and photo
filters the Nexus 4 does however have
the new 360 panorama mode that came with
Android 4.2 which is pretty awesome but
then again the s3 will probably get that
feature too when it gets updated to 4.2
somewhere down the line so when it comes
to the cameras the edge goes to the
galaxy s3 call quality is about the same
on both phones when using t-mobile but
there is a noticeable difference in the
speakers you be the judge of which one
is better while I play the same song on
each phone
as you can see our here in this case the
s3 speaker is louder than the Nexus 4
especially when laying on its back so
again the galaxy s3 gets to win in this
category on the software side of things
the galaxy s3 has Samsung's TouchWiz UI
over top of Android which includes nice
little features like Wireless toggles
smart stay and smart rotation which use
the front-facing camera to control the
screen and motion controls which allow
you to do things like swiping your palm
will cross the screen to take a
screenshot and a whole bunch more but
it's the software on the nexus board
that really draws you to the phone being
a Nexus device it runs Android the way
Google envisioned it to be and you'll
pretty much be one version of Android
ahead of the galaxy s3 and other non
Nexus devices most of the time so you'll
get to enjoy the latest and greatest
from Google at least a couple of months
before everybody else does like some of
the other categories this again comes
down to personal preference well I like
the value add-ons TouchWiz brings to the
Galaxy s3 I also like the pure Google
experience and the super fast updates
you get on the Nexus 4 the last thing
we'll take a look at our notable
features on each phone unlike the Nexus
4 the galaxy s3 has full 4G LTE support
it has a physical home button which
keeps you from accidentally pressing at
times it has an expandable microSD card
slot and it supports OTG and MHL output
unlike the galaxy s3 the Nexus 4
supports qi wireless charging which
means you can finally dish the wire
completely and the slippery display lets
your fingers easily glide across the
screen which is great for gaming so
there you have it that's our breakdown
of the galaxy s3 in the Nexus 4 like we
said in the beginning of the video both
phones have the pros and cons and
deciding on which phone is best for you
isn't just a matter of adding them up
but it's also looking at which pros and
cons are most important to you alright
that's it for me in this video if you
