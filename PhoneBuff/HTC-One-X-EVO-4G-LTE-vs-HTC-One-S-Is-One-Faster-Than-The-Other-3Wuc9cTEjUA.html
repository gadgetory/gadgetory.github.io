in this video we're doing a speed test
between the HTC evo 4g LTE from sprint
basically this guy is sprint's variant
of the HTC One X against t-mobile's HTC
One S over here on the right so I'm
going to go ahead and start the speed
comparison test by turning both of these
phones on pressing holding the power
button the same time both phones
actually have HTC's fast boot setup
enabled so let's go ahead and see which
one actually loads up the android OS
first both ones are running the same
version of Android both have HTC sense
for both have dual-core 1.5 gigahertz
processors and a 1 gigabyte of RAM so
very equal little maybe just a split
second faster on the EVO 4G LTE here or
the HTC One X than it did on the 1's so
we'll have to give the win over to the
evo 4g LTE usually I don't like to give
a win to a phone if it's just a split
second but considering these guys are so
equally matched because because they're
basically the same phone other than the
screen mainly the 1280 by 720 resolution
I have to give the win to the h 2 1 xt
on the left so let's go ahead and go to
the application speed test well load up
flixster for our first test so one two
three and up this actually opened up
first on the HTC One S so go ahead and
hit home we'll load up the next
application which will be scorecenter so
one two three load up first on the HTC
one x or EVO 4G LTE let's go ahead and
load up let's do a Google Earth so one
two three and of course both apps are
gonna be running in the background on
our on each phone that one is pretty
close this guy's actually zooming in on
a city where this guy isn't but load up
around the same time let's go ahead and
just back out of here and go to let's do
a calculator both of them have the same
calculator app so one two three exactly
about the same time so let's do Google
Maps one two three
so pretty much as you'd expect I mean
pretty much exactly the same performance
out of both of these guys on the high
resolution screen though doesn't seem to
be bugging the HTC One X or even 4G LTE
its handling just as well as the HTC One
SS but technically you would think that
the one has to be a little bit quicker
considering the lower resolution which
puts less of a demand on the GPU then
necessary so much to CPU but let's go
ahead and launch the cameras on both
phones to see if we get any kind of
separation here so one two three and
again pretty much load at the same time
hopefully the browser test will give us
a better indicator as far as you know
one being faster than the other I'll go
ahead and load up the internet on both
devices I did clear up the history on
both phones so we'll go ahead and do our
first test and of course that's foam
buff com so let's type it in here
alright so i typed in phone buff on both
browser just go ahead and hit go one two
three populated first on the 1's see the
advertisements personal 1s the 1s is
done and now the evo 4g LTE or HTC One X
is done so have to give the win there to
the 1s go ahead and load up this article
right here one two three
alright so the one is done and now the
protection agency when X is still
actually when X still going so again the
wind goes to the one s so surprisingly
you know the one s does actually seem to
be performing faster it's go ahead and
go to another website might just be
phone buff will go to nfl.com one two
three alright so this time it's actually
faster on actually nevermind this load
of the full HTML websites go ahead and
go to yahoo com I don't know why this
one loaded the full site will do yahoo
one two three so again a little bit
faster seemed like on the 1x let's go
ahead and load up the full desktop
version on each device and both are
still loading and the one s is done and
now the 1x is M so so far I mean it
really does look like the one s actually
has a little bit of an advantage when it
comes to the browser may be due to the
resolution resolution difference but
let's go ahead and open up an article
will do let's do best tattoos on
Olympians so let's go ahead and tap this
article at the same time one two three
and at this time it seems like you're
loaded it up a little bit faster on the
HTC One X so i mean overall i have to
say that maybe if you're going to give
an edge to a browser maybe you'd give it
to the HTC one s but i mean like in this
test the 1x actually one out let's go
ahead and do a quick benchmark maybe
that will give us the best answer will
do the browser mark test so our
something's going to do a quick
benchmark here we'll hit run benchmark
at the same time i'll just skip straight
to the results so you guys all have to
look at the whole process and then
hopefully you know the scores will tell
us a better swear as far as which phones
browser is actually faster alright so
the browser market benchmark is done and
as you can see the 1s actually scored
less with
89600 37 where this guy got 90 5800 so
you know take that for what it's worth
you know from the test that I did look
like the 1s was actually a bit faster as
far as you know they're being separation
but the benchmark tells us otherwise and
you know that was validated by the last
tested the 1x actually want so I mean at
the end of the day these phones are
pretty much equal so you know either way
you go you're going to get a nice fast
device you know mainly due to the fact
that the Bulls run in the same processor
is like I said in the beginning of the
video they're both running HTC Sense for
one gigabyte RAM basically everything
the same other than the resolution but
anyway that's it for me in this video
