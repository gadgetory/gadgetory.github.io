finally back with another video this
time a drop test of the brand spanking
new Galaxy Note 5 now if you've been a
subscriber of the channel for long
enough you know that we don't do your
typical drop test here at Bombo and
instead we do things bomb buff style
where with the help of a professional
drop test machine we give you the most
accurate and consistent drop tests on
YouTube so that way you can take the
result from this drop test video and
compare them to the results of a
previous drop test video that we have on
the channel to surely get an apples to
apple or Samsung to Apple comparison to
get a feel for how durable and how tough
a phone is relative to another because
at the end of the day that's all that
really matters every phone is eventually
going to break every phone is eventually
going to crack but what we want to see
is how long it takes to get to that
point and how well one phone does and
the same exact test compared to another
to truly figure out which one is more
durable with that said let's go ahead
and get right into it
all right so for this first test we're
going to be dropping the note 5 on its
back from 1 meter onto tile whoo and
just like the s6 the note fires back
cracks from that first drop it actually
did worse than the s6 did with the
cracks on the note 5 spider webbing a
lot more throughout the back panel but
it is worth mentioning that these cracks
aren't on the very top layer of glass so
you can still technically run your
finger across it without really risking
it cutting you at this point
next we're dropping the note 5 on its
side from the same height
and as you can see very little damage to
the bottom of the foam there's almost
nothing there so it's actually pretty
impressive for the final drop on tile
we're gonna be dropping the no.5
face-first from one meter and it still
works the glass is definitely cracked
mostly along the left side of the phone
with some spider webbing going across to
the right but the phone still does
function with no real damage to the
display itself all right so this next
drop is onto concrete and this back drop
onto concrete is what pretty much did it
for the galaxy s6 so let's see if the
note 5 can fare any better okay so the
back glass is now completely shattered
as you'd kind of expect and it's so bad
that even the camera's glass is cracked
but the phone still works which you
couldn't really say about the s6 at this
point but at the same time it's not
fully functional like some of the other
phones we've tested with the bottom
right of the display on the note 5 not
responding to the touch so the rest of
the screen worked but that bottom-right
area just wouldn't work I try to reboot
it and no good so while it technically
survived this drop that the Essex failed
it is still a bit of a disappointing
result so still two more drops left to
go the first of which is dropping the
note 5 on its side again but this time
onto concrete
so while the front in the back of the
note five are covered in glass which
makes it a little more fragile the side
of the phone with that metal band seems
to be among the studies that we've
tested with very little additional
damage from that concrete side drop last
drop is also the hardest drop and that's
a face flat drop onto concrete okay so
the glass is way more shatter than
before and the display now has visible
damage with a vertical shriek on the
right side which interestingly is where
the screen wasn't working earlier so in
the end the note 5 does better than the
Galaxy s6 in this drop test but still
not as good as some of the other phones
that we've tested so if you plan on
picking one of these guys up be careful
or get a case all right guys that's
pretty much it for me in this video
thank you for watching in as always I'll
see you guys in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
