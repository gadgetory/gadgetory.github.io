something that has been going on on
YouTube for a long time now in fact
there's something that's been going on
in the tech review game for a long time
now that just really really bothers me
and honestly I think if you guys knew
what was going on I think it would
bother you too what am I talking about
I'm talking about how many factors like
Apple and Samsung are paying certain
reviewers for I'm not gonna say fake
reviews but for positive reviews now
just to be clear when I say a
manufacturer is paying a reviewer the
form of payment I'm talking about is not
the one that you're thinking where
they're physically writing a check out
to the reviewers name in fact if that
was the case it wouldn't really bother
me that much because at least by law at
least by law that relationship has to be
disclosed to the audience so that what
you guys will know what's up you'll
understand that hey no matter how hard
this reviewer is trying to be unbiased
he's trying to be honest at the end of
the day it's sponsored content right
it's sponsored content you understand
that this can be a background level of
bias and that's why that law is in place
to begin with no it's this other form of
payment this indirect form of payments
that doesn't require a check to be
written and therefore doesn't require a
disclosure and maybe the worst part is
even if there was a disclosure where the
reviewer actually said hey this is my
relationship with the manufacturer I
think it would fly over most people's
heads and most people wouldn't really
register it as being a payment but trust
me when I tell you you know I've been to
this tech game for a long time it is
definitely a payment so what is this
indirect payment method that many
factors have actually been using for
years to manipulate the media to get
positive reviews to words
early access what do I mean by early
access and how the heck is that the same
thing as being a payment so to
understand it you kind of that step into
the mind of a reviewer or a youtuber so
I'm just going to give you an example
and hopefully it'll make things clearer
hypothetically speaking let's say a
company like Apple or Samsung doesn't
really matter who let's just use Apple
as the example let's say Apple goes up
to a reviewer and says hey you know that
iPhone 8 that's gonna be released next
week well we want to give you an a small
group of cherry-pick reviewers exclusive
early access so that way you guys can
work on your videos and post your videos
before any other reviewers and before
the general public gets their hands on
the device what do you think are
you interested and unless that reviewer
is somehow brain dead like there's no
way he's not going to be interested
right because anybody who's been doing
reviews for long enough knows you get
something as hot as the iPhone eight
before everybody else and you post your
video before everybody else like your
video is gonna do really really well
so let's just say this reviewer gets his
hands on the iPhone eight and tomorrow
morning on YouTube he posts the first
iPhone 8 unboxing he shows you what the
phone looks like shows you what's inside
the box goes over a lot of the new
features and all that good stuff and
it's literally going to be on YouTube
tomorrow morning are you going to watch
it like for real it's on YouTube
tomorrow morning the iPhone 8 a legit
one are you going to watch it but of
course you're gonna watch it right I'm
gonna watch it
everybody's gonna watch things shared
all over social media spread all over
the web and before you know it this
simple iPhone unboxing video is gonna
have millions and millions of views
thanks to Apple giving this reviewer
early access so while Apple may not have
paid this reviewer directly in cash
because he got early access and got
millions of views and because he's
putting ads on those millions of views
the reviewer ends up getting paid right
I think there's just no other way to
look at it the reviewer ends up getting
paid and it's not just the money that he
makes off of that one video in the short
term but also all the money that he'll
make from the new subscribers that video
gets in the long term so it's a huge
bump for any reviewers business and you
know the way I look at it is having
early access is almost as good as having
money in the bank which kind of leads
you to the next question
which is why like why would apple juice
to give this reviewer early access
instead of that reviewer what would
Apple essentially be paying this group
of reviewers instead of that group of
reviewers and I think when most people
ask themselves this question the first
answer that really comes to mind is well
these reviewers have the largest
followings right there are the biggest
channels out there and it only makes
sense that Apple and Samsung would want
to work with them to get the maximum
amount of exposure that's definitely
true to a certain extent right like you
can't just be any bum off the street and
expect to get the iPhone 8 early that's
just not how it works like they're not
gonna work with you unless you have a
decent following and produce decent
videos but at the same time like I don't
think you have to be the biggest tech
channel out there to get early access
because I really don't think that these
manufacturers are after the raw exposure
these review
bring to the table if exposure was the
only thing that these manufacturers were
after then why not just send a review
unit to every tech channel that has over
300,000 subscribers it's not like they
can't afford it and that strategy is
sure to get them more exposure than they
would otherwise no you see that's not
what they're after manufacturers know
that their early videos the ones that
come on before everybody else or what
the majority of people end up seeing and
because they know this they want to make
sure that when people end up seeing
these videos when they see these reviews
that they're positive right they don't
want just any review they want positive
reviews and the reason why they want
that is these are manufacturers what
they do what they're here for is to sell
products the PR people that work for
them they're here to get the maximum
exposure for that brand that's positive
so they could sell products I'd never
forget that now I know a lot of you guys
may be watching this and thinking I
don't know Dave maybe you're just being
salty dude like maybe you're just
jealous mad because these other tech
channels are getting this early access
because they're the bigger channels and
okay like okay sure
I'm not getting really access all right
and I'm not the biggest tech channel out
there but I know how these manufacturers
think and the reason why I know how to
think is because I have gotten early
access and I got it back when I had only
300,000 subscribers which you know once
again kind of blows the theory that you
have to be the biggest tech channel out
there out of the water so back before
the galaxy s6 was announced like before
anybody had even seen the phone Samsung
invited me and a few other youtubers out
to get exclusive early access and they
give us enough time to work on our
videos before they actually announced
the phone so that way we could actually
post our videos at the same time as
their press events and while other
reviewers you know we're just waking up
but wiping the eye crust out of the eyes
and sipping their coffee our fully
polished videos were out and ready and
surprise surprise those videos did
really really well I did a top 10 you
features video and that thing's got 1.8
million views now for foam buff
especially back then that was a lot of
views normally those kind of videos get
like maybe four or five six hundred
thousand views so the differential of
1.2 million the extra revenue that came
with those 1.2 million views and all the
new subscribers that came as a result I
attributed to Samsung giving me early
and then something interesting happened
you know after having this relationship
with Sansa for years that started off
with them inviting me out to press
events and you know even send me
Christmas gifts and then eventually led
to the highest point where the gaming
exclusive early access all the sudden
like you just stop talking to me like
they almost cut me off I felt like I was
blacklisted I didn't get it like I
didn't get why the video I produced for
them when I got early access did really
well 1.8 million views 20,000 plus likes
and overall is a very positive video
because I was just talking about the new
features but then I looked back at the
channel and it started to make sense you
know this is me speculating okay I can't
prove it but it started to make sense to
me where you know the video I posted
after I got back so this like a month
later I got my own phones I posted the
drop test right the phone bust out drop
test we use a professional machine and I
compared it side-by-side to the iPhone
being all glass the galaxy s6 didn't do
so hot in fact it did pretty badly it
turned off completely after four drops
where the iPhone made it all the way
through next video was a speed test
between again the iPhone and the HTC
unfortunately for the galaxy s6 again it
lost it came in last place now look I
felt bad about the results of those
videos right I mean like Samsung had
just invited me out to get early
exclusive access this is a huge favor
they're doing me all the benefits that
come with early access and you know Here
I am posting not one but two videos
where it shows that their phone doesn't
stack up as well to the competition at
least in those specific tests but like
what am I supposed to do like those were
the results so the videos went live they
collectively got millions views and as a
result I feel like I've been blacklisted
this is just me speculating right like I
can't prove that the negative exposure
from those two videos is why Samsung
decided to stop working with me I mean
it could have just been you know my
haircut or they didn't like that I grew
a beard like you can't say for sure but
you don't have to speculate for too long
to kind of put two and two together and
come to the conclusion that yeah is the
negative exposure that just wasn't worth
it for Samson anymore and like I'm not
picking on Samsung and I'm not the only
one that's been blacklisted right like
Apple has blacklisted other publications
for covering the whole bendgate thing
and there's articles about I'll be
putting those down below in the
description if you guys want to check
them out but I guess the point I'm
trying to make here is getting early
access for a reviewer is all
as good as having money in the bank okay
it's almost as good as having money in
the bank and reviewers know this and
trust me when I tell you that
manufactures know this - these are
billion-dollar corporations they have
some of the smartest people in the world
working for them they are not dumb like
they know what they're giving to a
reviewer when they give them really
access and as a result they use that to
manipulate the media to essentially get
positive reviews if you're consistently
giving a manufacturer positive reviews
and you have a decent enough following
like you're probably going to
consistently find yourself on that
manufacturers early access invite list
like that's just how it works if you
don't and you do or say something that
pisses a manufacturer off then you can
kiss that early access and all the
benefits that come with it
goodbye I know I did but you know as a
reviewer I don't want to play puppet to
a manufacturer right because like as
soon as you have to start thinking on
whether or not what you say or do in a
review might offend or piss off a
manufacturer at that point you're not a
reviewer anymore like you're a puppet so
the next time you see a reviewer who's
consistently getting early access just
keep in mind that you know that early
access comes with a price like I'm not
saying that these reviewers are or not
being honest and are being dishonest
like I don't think that's the case but
at the same time it comes with the price
and that price is having to dance this
line of you know giving an honest review
while also not pissing off a
manufacturer so let's just start calling
early access what it really is right
like just as you would call any form of
content that's been paid for sponsored
content early access is essentially
sponsored content and I'm not saying
there's anything wrong with that there
isn't anything wrong with that it's only
wrong when the audience doesn't know
about it right I mean that's why we have
laws in place to protect the consumer
obviously early access is a loophole
that manufacturers have found so our
only defense to it is really awareness
and hopefully this video has given you
that awareness has armed you with that
awareness so next time you see a video
you know what's up anyways that is it
for me in this video thank you guys for
watching and as always I'll be keeping
it real with you in the very next
