smartphone season is officially underway
I'm excited to bring you guys more
videos thumbs up if you are excited to
today with a speed test between the
first flagship smartphone of the year
from ACC and the u ultra going
head-to-head with the current bumblestop
recess champ in the iPhone 7 plus now
the U ultra is an interesting phone from
ACC it's not quite what I was expecting
from them and to be honest the spec
sheet isn't all that impressive
especially given its $700 plus price tag
but then again if you look at the iPhone
7 plus the spec sheet its specs aren't
mind-blowing either but yet it remains
the fastest smartphone in the world so
the question is the HTC optimised view
ultra enough to actually change that or
at the very least keep up with the
iPhone let's find out but before we get
into it I want to give a quick shout out
to Full Sail University for sponsoring
today's episode Full Sail offers
technology degree programs both on
campus and online to help you build a
skill set for the tech industry learn
more at the link below alright we'll
kick things off by starting the
stopwatch is on each phone and then
immediately taking a selfie where the U
ultras faster camera launch puts it
ahead early on in the speed test as it
moves on to the second row with the
iPhone just a half step behind but as
we've seen time and time again while the
quicker animations on Android phones
helped give them an edge in the
lightweight application the iPhones
faster storage and 810 processor make up
for it in the heavier applications like
Photoshop and lab Sid where the iPhone 7
actually takes the lead process you had
time lapse like it was nothing having
already moved on to the gaming row
however the Snapdragon 820 won under the
hood of the U ultra has proven that it's
no slouch either with it completing the
time-lapse fairly quickly pushing the U
ultra on through the gaming row where
it'll try to cut down on the iPhone
bleed but the iPhone is once again
proving why it's the undefeated Pombo
style recess champ just blazing through
all these heavy-duty games as this their
lightweight application with it now two
full apps ahead so the chance of seeing
it come back by the HTC are getting
slimmer and slimmer and I do have to say
that the U ultra is looking a bit slower
here in the first lap compared to some
of the other Snapdragon 820 one phones
we've tested like the pixel
for example but who knows we do still
have a few apps left to go in the first
lap with the whole second lap ahead
where historically HTC has done a pretty
good job at managing its RAM but
unfortunately for the U ultra so has the
iPhone with it now going through the
second lap after finishing the first
with the time of 1 minute and 17 seconds
and just as we've seen in previous be
tests the iPhone is having no issues
keeping the apps open in the background
with us pausing on each apps to make
sure that the app is actually open as
sometimes the iOS shows you a screenshot
of the last saved space but yes all the
apps are actually open with the iPhone
racing to the finish line and looking to
laughter you ultra and it does finishing
with a total time of 1 minute and 49
seconds with the U ultra still working
on loading both the mobile and the full
versions of the Amazon website
finishing the first claps 10 seconds
after the iPhone finished both laps with
the time of 1 minute and 59 seconds so
we'll go ahead and fast-forward the ACC
to the finish line where unfortunately
it's 4 gigabytes of RAM proved to be
insufficient as it struggled to keep all
the apps open having to reload almost
every single app outside of Photoshop
lapses and subway server surprisingly
with it completing the test over 8
minutes after the iPhone with the total
time of 3 minutes and 30 seconds making
the winner and still fumble style speed
test champ the iPhone 7 plus now before
we take a look at the individual app
load up times I want to give a shout out
