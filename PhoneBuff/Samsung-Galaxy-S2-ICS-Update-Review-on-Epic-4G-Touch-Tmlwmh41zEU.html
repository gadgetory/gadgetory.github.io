this video we're doing a review on the
new ice cream sandwich update on the
samsung galaxy s2 in this case it's on
the sprint epic 4g touch i'll go ahead
and show you you know the general update
that you would get with any galaxy s2
and then some of the sprint specific
features but let's go ahead and go into
the settings so we can see that i am
running on android 4.0 for if you tap on
this guy you do get that little easter
egg press and hold on it and you get a
whole bunch of a little ice cream
sandwich android so pretty fun but let's
go ahead and talk about the features
first thing you'll notice is the lock
screen so i'll go ahead and lock the
screen when you unlock it you have your
typical background or wallpaper but now
when you unlock you actually have this
little lock right here you could drag in
any direction so you're not to drag you
know the picture off the screen like you
would before you can drag in any
direction and unlock like that so pretty
cool to see that it's kind of like it is
on the new galaxy s3 our new TouchWiz so
it's nice to see the samsung you know
included that feature if i unlock it
what actually you could also do is get
the weather to show up on the lock
screen so i'll go ahead and go to the
display settings really quick it's going
to check whether and I let it get my gps
location so i'll lock it again you see
now it's showing the weather so another
cool feature makes a little bit more
handy to have your weather right there
instead of having to unlock it you know
a lot of us you know use the widget up
here i don't have mine up right now but
typically i do and it makes it easier to
have it around the lock screen so that's
nice next thing once i was a
notification bar first thing you'll
notice is the 4g icons a little bit
different we go ahead and turn off Wi-Fi
really quick and turn on 4G um you'll
notice that it's basically like the 3g
icon you basically get the up and down
arrows for upload and download honestly
i don't really prefer this one because
the old one actually gave you you know
the signal strength that you have 4g now
you just get the download and upload but
really isn't that big of deal for me
another thing that you'll notice on the
notification bar is the battery
percentage i'm not sure if my camcorder
will be able to catch that but anyway
you can see the little white text right
over here that's a battery percentage it
says eighty-six percent and again this
is
you can actually turn off in the
settings if you don't want it so this
battery percentage icon kind of similar
to what it is on the galaxy s3 and
actually enable and disable the same way
by checking unchecking this guy so you
see it's they're not there and there
again so anyway that is that um you
don't have the option to go into your
settings from here which is kind of
disappointing because I did like having
that you know quick short cover here
because instead of you know I rather do
that than having to hit menu and then
settings I know it's really the same
thing I mean it's two button presses but
i don't know i just got kind of used to
that so anyway that's one thing that
like um let's talk about the launcher so
go ahead and open up the app launcher
and it looks pretty much the same as it
did before but the main difference now
is you can actually go to sprint ID so
this is for the sprint variant the epic
4g touch specifically you can go over to
what's called my ID it's already
pre-loaded and download or anything and
boom you have the stock ICS launcher
which is definitely something that you
know i like to have I mean just having
that choice is nice i actually prefer
this launcher maybe because I'm so used
to my galaxy nexus but I know some of
you guys like touch was more because
really matter i mean doesn't hurt to
have the choice if you want to go back
you just tap on the samsung ID and boom
you have your regular touch with
launcher so that's definitely a cool
feature multitasking you press and hold
home and you know you get the typical
ICS multitasking if you wanted to close
your apps out just slide them over to
the left like that you can see has an
option for task manager it moves up to
the middle when you have no apps you
know i can tap on this and i can see no
applications okay look at my ram clear
the memory whatever i would do before um
let's see another thing is a screenshot
so before you take a screenshot when you
know pressing the power button and the
home button at the same time and it
still works but now you can actually do
the regular ICS way which is hold a
volume down and then power so you
actually have two methods take a
screenshot not really a big deal i me if
you're used to the home method but
sometimes you know if you're pressing
and holding the home button and it
brings up the applications it could get
confused with that so it's a little bit
easier to do with the volume down I
should prefer using the volume down but
anyway that's not that big of a deal
another thing is the swype keyboard so
i'll go ahead and load up the keyboard
really quick let's go ahead and load up
a
of the calendar really quick and make a
calendar event so anyway see the swype
keyboard looks a little bit different
basically just the newer version of it
works pretty well obviously you know an
improvement over the older one so it's
definitely to be better another thing is
the settings let's go ahead and go over
to the same so first thing you'll notice
is actually when I press the menu button
instead of having a little short like
six short cut squares over here at the
bottom you have this more out this
longer little rectangular box and this
is a little bit cleaner and that's the
general theme with ICS and if i tap into
settings you can see I have these
wireless toggles right here for quick
and easy access honestly it's not that
big of deal mean on the Galaxy Nexus is
the great thing because you know you
have your settings shortcut it's really
easy to get to but on a phone with
TouchWiz all these chakras are available
up here so really no need to have it
over here of course you have a data
usage which you know I'm using a lot of
data on this phone but this one's nice
to be able to you know control your data
but if you're on sprint you have the
sprint you know epic 4g touch you don't
really even need it that's why I set the
limit so high because they kept on
bugging me as far as the warning so i
took that thing off so anyway that is
that the settings are new and refreshed
like it is on ice cream which go ahead
and show you really quick that it
doesn't face unlock so you could use you
know this guy's front-facing camera it's
under security of course so I tap
security and go to screen lock you can
also set their set it to be a no screen
lock by hitting none which is I don't
know I mean some people like it that way
every time you press the power button it
takes you straight into what you want to
get into anyways just go ahead and go to
security and screen lock you see
facelock I get set it up right now as I
normally would I'm not gonna do it I was
Troy you guys that it does work anyway
close out of there um but yeah that's
pretty much it i mean overall you know
the updates been really good i mean if
you have if you don't have to galaxy or
if you have the galaxy s2 more likely
already got this update um mainly this
video is probably for those of you guys
who haven't got it and are considering
buying this guy specially now that I
know a lot of the carriers are lowering
the price on it and it's a really good
deal because it's a really great phone
mean great camera great front-facing
camera
screen with a super amulet not the
highest resolution obviously but um
definitely something I like anyway so
far you know I have to give it a thumbs
up for the update no major hiccups no
glitches only glitch I kind of noticed a
little bit was when I press the home
button sometimes the see how the
backgrounds like great out sometimes the
bottom bar doesn't get great out it just
like these little icons like show bright
and it kind of looks weird but other
than that so far so good everything's
working good it's nice to be able to
have google chrome working on here um
yeah this is you know seven-minute video
just talking about update hopefully it
helps you guys out if you like it please
