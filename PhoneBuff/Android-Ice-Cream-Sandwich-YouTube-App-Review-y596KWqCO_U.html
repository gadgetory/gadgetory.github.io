and today we'll be doing a quick video
on the youtube app on Ice Cream Sandwich
so the main thing I want to go over is
the differences on this app versus on
2.3 and the truth is there isn't much
other than the user interface you can
see it looks a lot cleaner than it did
on gingerbread and main difference is
when you go to your account instead of
having to hit menu and then channel and
to get your favorites and whatnot you
have it all right here on one screen you
can see the top bar of here the icons
are changing based off of the screen and
Matt so I could upload a video of them
here and from here I could hit record a
video and you can see it's a white
background with black text this looks a
lot cleaner go ahead and compare it to
the gingerbread version of the app so
you can see side-by-side comparison and
I you can see just looks a lot cleaner
on the Galaxy Nexus and four-point-oh
them does on 2.3 to get to your channel
from here you have to hit menu and then
my channel we hear you to scroll over
twice to get to your favorites you just
tap this guy over here you have to
scroll to the side and that's pretty
much it the functionality wise they're
about the same I just looks better on
here alright that's it for me in this
video this is dave from phone book calm
