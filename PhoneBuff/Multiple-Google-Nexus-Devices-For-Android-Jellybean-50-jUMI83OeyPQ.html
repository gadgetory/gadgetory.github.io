mobile com and in this video we talked
about the recent report by the wall
street journal which tells us how google
is planning to change the way they go
about launching the newest version of
their android OS this time being dubbed
as jellybean five-point know so
basically what Google is gonna be doing
differently this time around is instead
of working with just one manufacturer
exclusively like it's done in the past
with that HTC with the Nexus One and
Samsung with the Nexus S and more
recently the Samsung Galaxy Nexus they
can be working with multiple
manufacturers at the same time building
multiple Nexus devices now this is still
very much rumor there's just a report
from The Wall Street Journal although
they have a pretty good track record
with the rumors um I can't say for sure
if it's a hundred percent accurate
anyways it make a lot of sense if it
were because one it would lead to
manufacturers releasing updates a lot
quicker than it normally would if they
do build a Nexus device and the reason
for that is um with ice cream sandwich
for example only samsung had access to
the ice cream sandwiches code that's why
it's been six months now since I from
Sam came out and most devices out there
don't have ice cream sandwich other than
a few that launched and was like the HTC
One series and a pu samsung devices have
gotten the update but other than that
for the most part you know most phones
still in Gingerbread and obviously five
or six months down the line you want you
know most entrances to be updated to the
latest version like they would be on iOS
and on Windows Phone and obviously that
has to do with androids fragmentation
and I think having multiple
manufacturers working on a Nexus device
would lead to faster update times so
that would take care of the preparation
issue for google another thing is it
will also get rid of that concern that
people have google buying motorola um
you know think that it would give
motorola unfair advantage for giving
everyone early access to the code for
the next version of the OS obviously
you're letting everybody compete in the
market and another thing is for google
it will help them control their apps for
because with the the new Nexus phones
what they'll be doing is selling it
directly on google play like they do the
Galaxy Nexus so this guy is only 400
bucks on the Google Play Store and
imagine the galaxy are the next
Nexus devices are stead of Nexus devices
will be similarly priced maybe a little
bit higher when it's new but pretty much
you'll be cutting out the middleman so
lower price consumers to get an unlocked
phone but more importantly for google
they'll be able to control the apps
actually come on the phone so for
example on verizon the Galaxy Nexus
doesn't have google wallet obviously
there's a workaround for that but you
know the average consumer isn't going to
go through the hassle of doing the work
round and they're going to end up using
verizon's version of that payment
gateway NFC payment gateway and
obviously Google wants you to use their
version as they get paid for it so
anyways that's another advantage for
Google for us be multiple Nexus devices
can't really complain about them and
that sounds really exciting being able
to get you know different models to look
at for that pure Android experience
that's always been updated to the latest
version of the OS that's pretty much it
for me in this video just wanted to let
you guys know about the news and
hopefully this rumor turns out to be
true because I would definitely love to
see multiple Nexus devices and obviously
i think i put it would appreciate
getting faster updates on android all
