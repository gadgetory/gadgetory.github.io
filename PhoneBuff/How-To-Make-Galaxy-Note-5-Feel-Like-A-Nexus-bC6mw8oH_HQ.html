enjoyed that intro be sure to give this
video a big thumbs up I was able to make
the intro all dramatic with music and
sound effects from clips I got from
audio blogs which is a
subscription-based royalty free stock
media site that gives you unlimited
access to over a hundred thousand audio
clips and as a special deal for you foam
buffs audio box is giving you a free
7-day trial where you can download up to
a hundred and forty clips now these
clips are valued at almost 50 bucks a
pop so if you do the math it adds up to
an amazing deal so if you're interested
in getting some sound effects and music
for your videos for your songs or
whatever other creative work you do take
it advantage of that 7 day free trial by
hitting that first link down below in
the description all right let's get to
getting rid of that cartoony look that
comes with TouchWiz and do all that
beautiful hardware some justice by
making the phone look and feel like a
nexus alright so the first step to next
applying the note 5 is to install a
theme with material design to do this go
to settings find themes and then tap on
theme store from here find a theme
that's called either material or
material design and note that while
there are some material themes out there
that cost money there is one available
for free if you can find it once you've
found a material theme click download
and when it's done press apply after a
few seconds the theme will finish
installing and voila the settings and
the UI in general now look much much
closer to stock Android and way less
cartoony so this step alone can make a
huge difference but we're not done yet
step number two is to install the Google
Apps that you'd normally find on a nexus
phone so go to the Play Store and
download things like Google Calendar
Google messenger Google camera Google's
clock app and a few other google apps
all of which I'll be putting the links
to down below in the description after
you've installed the Google Apps step
number three is to disable both Samsung
and any carrier bloatware that may be
pre-loaded onto the phone do this by
opening up the app drawer hitting edit
and then tapping on the little minus
icon next to the apps that you don't
want so in my case I disabled all the 18
T apps along with some Samsung ones like
s voice and milk music disabling these
unwanted apps not only makes the phone
look cleaner but it can also help the
phone run a little smoother as well so
you didn't think we're going to stick
with a touchwiz launcher did you no way
step number four is to install a new
launcher you can either get Google's own
launcher which I'll link to down below
or you can download a third-party
launcher like nova launcher that in
addition to having this stock look also
comes with icon packs to match the icons
on Nexus phones either way after
downloading your launcher of choice
press on the home button and you'll be
given an option to choose your default
launcher since we're gonna be sticking
with the nova launcher we'll tap on nova
here which in turn will disable the
touchwiz launcher after you've set it as
a default launcher open the app drawer
and go into nova settings if you bought
the paid version first thing i'd
recommend doing is going into the apps
and widgets option selecting hide apps
and then hide any samsung system apps
that you downloaded google ones to
replace like the camera and calendar i'd
also hide any apps that you wanted to
delete earlier but couldn't when done
with that go to the look and feel option
in nova settings tap on icon theme and
set it to android lollipop
this will change the icons for apps like
the dialer to look just like they do on
Nexus phones instead of using Samsung's
more cartoony icons last thing you need
to do to get the launcher looking just
right is to set the correct grid in icon
sizes and nova settings so go to the
desktop option and set the desktop grid
to 5 by 4 then set the icon layout to an
icon size of 125 percent do the same
exact thing under the app and drawers
option and the dock option and you
be set last but not least the fifth and
final step is to get rid of those
annoying TouchWiz sounds by going back
into the main system settings
tapping on sounds and notifications then
ringtone and sounds and then switching
off both touch sounds and screen lock
sounds your sanity will thank you and
that's it you've not made your note5
feel like a Nexus took a little bit of
work I know and obviously TouchWiz is
still running behind the scenes but this
is the closest thing you can get to the
stock Android experience without having
to actually route the phone anyways that
is it for me in this video thank you
guys for watching in as always I'll see
you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
