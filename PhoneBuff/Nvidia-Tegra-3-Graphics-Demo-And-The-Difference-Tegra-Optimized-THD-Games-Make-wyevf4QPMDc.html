comm and in this video i want to talk
about the Tegra 3 processor and gaming
on Android and how it differs from some
of the other processors out in the
market in this case I'm using it on the
Asus Nexus 7 tablet from Google which
does have the NVIDIA Tegra 3 processor
with a 12 core GPU before I go into
comparing it you know with other
processors let's open up this global
application by Nvidia basically this
application is made to show off
detective threes graphics capabilities
and you know you see all kinds of
reflections shadows really good graphics
over here and everything this runs at a
really nice framerate and you just kind
of get an idea of you know what the
Tegra 3 processor is capable I mean
these are pretty much you know console
quality graphics which is pretty amazing
to have you know on your phone or on
your tablet so cool little split-screen
mode that you could actually enable
which shows you you know what it looks
like with all the effects enabled versus
with the effects disabled which you know
might happen depending on what kind of
phone that you have or what kind of
processor your device has so you could
actually enable the some of the effects
if you want and still be able to notice
the difference between you know the
Tegra 3 version maybe the regular
version so anyway that's a quick little
application you know thought I'd show
you guys that if you guys have the Tegra
3 processor in your device I'll
recommend checking it out it's pretty
cool but anyway let's go ahead and look
at you know what we really want to see
which is the difference that the sight
of three processor makes on the games on
Android you know when you go into the
Play Store and you go to an application
for example shine runner which is the
game one will show you the difference in
graphics it says you know enhance for
Tekken 3 right here enhance for Tekken 3
it says super detailed water and
on-camera splash effects exclusively for
Detective 3 devices so let's go ahead
and check out you know what it looks
like so I'm gonna go ahead and hit shine
runner on this tablet i'ma hit shine
runner on my samsung galaxy s3 which has
the Qualcomm s4 dual core processor and
obviously that's not a Nvidia processor
it's gonna look a little bit different
so I'm not gonna be able to do at the
same time
think see if I could zoom out a little
nope all right I'll go ahead and play it
on here really quick and then show you
what it looks like on the Tegra 3 so as
you can see I mean this game has really
nice graphics regardless of you know
what you're on but you know I'll show
you the difference in a second I really
can't say anything bad about her and it
looks really nice to me when I first
downloaded this application you know I
thought it did look you know really nice
but anyway that should be a long enough
little demo to give you an idea of what
it looks like now let's look at it on
the Tegra 3 and open up a map really
quick alright so I'm just gonna point
out the differences oh if you look at
the water
the water's quality is a little bit
better you know it looks a little bit
more realistic but you know another
effect that really sticks out at you is
uh when you jump on a ramp if I could
get up on this one you get a little
splash and you can see the whole screen
you know looks like it got wet so pretty
cool little effect I mean it's not you
know a big deal but it's nice little
enhancements that you know game
developers are adding to their games
because the second three processors did
one handle it into you know the little
effect does make a difference
another example is dead trigger so we'll
go ahead and go into debt trigger
description over here on the Play Store
about what it says for the secretary so
says supports extended effects on Tegra
3 devices let's see right here says
spectacular ragdoll effects Tiger 3 only
water simulation and take it 3 only so
I'll see what that's all about
I'll go ahead and do the same thing open
up dead trigger on here
open up dead trigger on here and we'll
see the difference so this one you know
it's not as notice we kinda have to play
a little bit longer I'm not sure if I
want to be able to actually find you
know a place in the map where it
actually has water or things like that
but you know give it a shot so
all right so here's the non Tegra 3
version obviously the graphics are still
really good I mean game developers are
doing a great job
you know the s4 processor in this case
isn't a slouch by any means
it definitely looks good but see if I
could walk around you know which I was
able to get in the same map but well
this will just have to do basically know
what let's look for the differences in
here so ok it looks like I'm gonna have
to shoot off these guys heads really
quick all right
so here's some water right here it's
gonna go and step on it you can see the
screen you know kind of made this little
like dripping effect so I'll walk
through it again and you have just
little things like that you know when
you're actually going through a map and
there's like a puddle of water on the
floor it looks a little bit more
realistic on the type of three devices
but nothing really huge but just wanted
to show you guys the difference between
that you know I'm sure as game
developers you know get you know more
and more used to the Tegra 3 devices
they're gonna be able to take advantage
of it much more a good way to actually
look for applications that support the
Tegra 3 processors is searching THD and
then Tegra so tht basically center like
Tegra HD and then you type in the word
Tegra alongside of it and if you're
pretty much gonna get a list of
applications that have been optimized
for the Tegra 3 processor it's pretty
cool way to get around it you know this
is how I found a lot of the games that
are optimized protector so obviously
Shadowgun you know madfinger games makes
their games
technically optimized and there's a few
others and some of them look really
really nice obviously you could also go
to the Tegra zone I downloaded this on
the tablet you know as soon as I pretty
much got it and you know you have your
typical you know news that you'd get but
you could go to games and do certain
little filters depending on what kind of
game you want but these are all Tegra 3
games Ortega
two games so pretty cool games like you
know Max Payne obviously are gonna
support the Tegra processor so anyway I
wanted to show you guys you know a
little bit more about you know what the
Tegra processors all about and you know
what it kind of offers you in the gaming
world of on Android so if you found this
video helpful please hit the like button
and subscribe to the channel if you have
any questions on you know how the Tegra
3 you know experience is different from
you know some of the other phones like
the galaxy s3 with a Qualcomm maybe the
Galaxy Nexus with the OMAP whatever it
is leave them in the comment I'll try to
get back to you as soon as possible
