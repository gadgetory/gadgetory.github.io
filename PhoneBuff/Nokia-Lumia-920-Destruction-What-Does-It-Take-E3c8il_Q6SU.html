in this video I will finish what I
started with the Nokia Lumia 920 I
already did a drop test and it survived
I did a hammer a knife test and it
survived the thing actually looks like a
champ so I'm gonna take it to the next
level to see just how much damage you
can take before it actually cracks and I
mean that literally so I'm gonna run it
over with my car and then we do a whole
bunch of other crazy stuff if it
actually survives that test so let's go
ahead and get right into it alright so
we'll go ahead and place this thing in
front of my car tire face up
all right so we got some tire marks on
here but see if the screen works and it
does so that means we get to go to the
next level
all right so survive the car test let's
take it to the next level
almost smack it with this piece of wood
as if we were baseball and the Sivas
fries that so I'll go ahead and back up
good now do with the screen facing it so
all right so you probably shouldn't try
that because the screen isn't turning on
now it doesn't actually look cracked but
I'm trying to power it on and it's not
responding I'm gonna go ahead and try to
see if I get gets thing to turn on and
if so we'll continue if not this is
probably the end of this test also the
Lumia 920 is still not responding maybe
I took a little bit too far obviously
I'm never gonna do that with your phone
but I did promise you guys I was going
to crack the phone and technically it
hasn't cracked to see if you guys could
actually see it I mean it has scratches
on the screen but it's still actually
not cracked so I'm gonna see how long it
takes out to crack this thing open and
we'll go ahead and start that by
throwing it up in the air so I'll go
ahead and back up and I'm a truck it in
air pretty high
I saw something fly out but it's just a
SIM card or so put pop that thing back
in pop back in and you see the damage
right here
I mean big-time damage on the corner but
that's how bad it still hasn't cracked
so we'll go ahead and let's go ahead and
throw it against the wall all right so I
said I was gonna throw on a wall but
there actually isn't a wall here what I
meant is the light post so I'll go ahead
and throw it against light post and see
if it finally cracks the loop so I'm
going to throw it as hard as I possibly
could against this little stone part
right over here so
there you go finally cracked it so
that's what would it probably take for
you to crack your phone this thing did
really really well the drop test handled
like a champ that's why the most
realistic one hammer and knife test and
key scratch test they're pretty good
obviously my goal here in this video was
to destroy it seems like I've done that
and it's kind of coming out of this
little frame I'll go I didn't do it one
more time to see what it looks like on
the inside
fail
so those you guys are curious what it
looks like on the inside of the Lumia
920 this is the front screen glass cover
thingy
completely came off you've got the layer
right over here for the screen I'm
trying to cut myself with all this glass
got this protective little I don't know
what the hell this is but anyway that is
that and difficult for it out completely
I don't want to cut myself so I mean I
don't know if you guys can see that what
it looks like on the inside pretty
interesting I mean how often will you
get an opportunity to see what it looks
like on the inside
I'll go ahead and try to see if I could
take this thing out completely
you know what I'm going to smash it
really quick on before
all right so you see the parts on the
floor over here it's all over the place
here's what's left inside the device and
oh there you go so here's the battery
you guys are wondering what that looks
like
so actually looks pretty cool you're
some of the other chips this is where
the SIM card slot goes or they see used
to used to be over here and some of the
other parts so anyways that is pretty
much it for me and this torture test on
the Nokia Lumia 920 obviously I took
this thing to the most extreme level
it's a really durable phone just don't
smack it against you know a light pole
or don't hit it with a big wooden stick
and you'll probably be good but anyway
that's it for me in this video if you
liked it if you found it helpful I don't
know how you find it helpful maybe shows
you how durable the phone is but anyways
if you liked it please give it a thumbs
up and you haven't already subscribe to
our Channel because we're doing a whole
bunch of more crazy stuff like this and
don't worry I have another Lumia I'll be
doing review very soon so thank you for
