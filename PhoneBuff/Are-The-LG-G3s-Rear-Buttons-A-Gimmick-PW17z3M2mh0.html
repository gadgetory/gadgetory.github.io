g3 is power and volume buttons aren't on
these sides of the foam and they're not
up top either instead they're on the
back of the phone which kind of makes
you wonder is LG onto something that no
other manufacturer has seen the notice
or our rear buttons just another gimmick
well we'll find out in a sec but before
we do I want to tell you about the
sponsor for today's episode in simple
mobile founder on the idea that your
phone is an extension of your own

the channel at the same time alright
let's get right into it so based on the
title you guys know that I obviously
don't think rear buttons are a gimmick
in fact it's actually the opposite I
think they're awesome and I have 5
reasons to back it up the first is
they're really easy to reach the g3 with
this 5.5 inch display is obviously a big
phone yet almost everybody have handed
it to has had no problems reaching the
buttons on top of that the buttons are
also ambidextrous with them being just
as easy to use with your left hand as
they are with your right reason number 2
is somewhat related but it has to do
specifically with when you're on a phone
call normally if you want to adjust the
volume in call you have to feel around
for the volume rocker and sometimes even
pull the phone away from your ear in
order to do so on the g3 you don't have
to worry about any of that as your
finger naturally rests on the rear
buttons allowing you to change the
volume both quickly and easily the third
reason why I'm loving this rear button
setup is I can use the buttons even when
the phone is inside of your pocket if
you're getting a phone call for example
you can silence it by pressing one of
the volume buttons if you're listening
to music it's the same story
sure you can tek
we do the same with a traditional button
layout but with rear keys
you only need one finger compared to
having to pinch your phone with two or
more if that is you can actually figure
out where those buttons are in the first
place
reason number four is one that I hate to
bring up but I've got to do it and
that's taking selfies taking a selfie
using the on-screen shutter or side
buttons can shake the phone which
results in blurry pictures on to g3
because the volume button is where your
finger naturally rests you can take a
selfie while holding the phone steady
every time finally the fifth reason why
I think rear buttons are awesome is they
make it a lot easier to take a
screenshot as you may or may not know to
take a screenshot on Android you need to
press the volume down and power button
simultaneously on the g3 those buttons
are right next to each other which means
that you can press both of them at the
same time with the same finger in other
words you can take one-handed
screenshots of course while all these
benefits are great there are some
drawbacks one of the major ones is you
can't access the buttons when the phone
is lying on its back
however LG has done a pretty good job at
minimizing this with knock-on but it's
still something worth noting the other
drawback isn't really a drawback so much
as it is a change and that the rear
buttons do take some getting used to for
me it was kind of weird at first but
after a day or so it started to feel
just as natural as buttons on any other
phone last thing I want to mention
before I head out of here is the
indirect benefit that rear buttons bring
to the table which are thinner bezels
look at the g2 and now the g3 and they
easily have some of the thinnest bezels
around that's why the g3 can have a
screen that's almost half an inch bigger
than the Galaxy s5s while maintaining
the overall same footprint I don't know
about you but that benefit in it of
itself makes rear buttons worth it for
me but what do you think let me know
down in the comments below but other
than that that is pretty much it for me
in this video thank you guys so much for
watching and I'll see you in the very
next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
