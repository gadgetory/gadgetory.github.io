could happen to your head if you and
your careless friends decide to ignore
this disclaimer you have been warned
what's up guys david MJ here and welcome
back to another episode of vs. the show
where we work with professionals to
conduct extreme durability tests and
this test today we're gonna see what
happens when you're talking on the phone
and an arrow it goes right in whether or
not that person survives I have to say
else close what's going on oh oh
all right so here we are at the testing
ground with our ballistics-gel head this
is legitimate ballistics gel that we got
online I'm at it mimics human flesh 100%
so if an arrow goes through here and it
penetrates that's what's gonna happen to
you if you could shot with an arrow in
the head what's up with her whether it
got here he used to have a neck or
whatever see what happened was in love
the office and melted a little we gained
a double chin yeah he kind of reminds me
of Julius Caesar and back then you know
gaining weight was a sign of wealth
right so we'll go ahead and call him
Caesar
so will Caesar survive when he gets shot
will die - protect him how deep will the
arrow go inside of his head I don't know
but the professional we're working with
today is Nicole and if she's gonna be
shooting this thing
she shouldn't be unleashing her wrath so
will Caesar survive
Nicole's wrath let's find out here we go
guys I mean she's like point-blank away
so I don't imagine that phone doing too
well
oh my god I'm nervous oh wait how part
of thing I don't know I don't know I owe
my green I know that's what that's like
there's a chance you might have survived
though pull this guy off did it go
didn't go oh well I phone same Caesar is
there no there's like pieces of imprint
but not not enough to break the skin
it'll oh you're gonna save your life
you're gonna have glass in your ear but
it's not gonna be in your head well you
know what I do want to see what it looks
like a slow motion okay all right so
let's see what happened
so hey if it doesn't kill you it'll
definitely give you a concussion oh my
god his face squishes right there so
that's concussion I don't that's not
good
he'll survive I think I think he said
he'd survive I mean look at his face but
he survives I think that's a concussion
all right so taking a closer look at the
phone it definitely bent but it did not
break uh-huh you can see right here so
let's go ahead and take a look at this
side it went all the way through but the
screen stopped the arrow the arrows
point actually is not going through the
screen here which is kind of surprising
right there is you're kind of expected
go through I I honestly thought at least
Pierce do and puncture the head but I
think because the head was so flush
against it it kind of just created a
wall for it to kind of just absorb all
the impact I mean if you guys saw that
high-speed camera that guy's face is
wobbling everywhere so I imagine you'll
have a really really gnarly bruise or
fractured skull but you won't be dead
you can see that the chips going through
items at the a9 chip I don't know but I
mean there you have it the iPhone can
protect your head from a German arrow so
congrats Apple you guys might save some
lives I don't know like some old war you
know back when they used to use bone
arrows that is it for us and this
episode we have more episodes coming
