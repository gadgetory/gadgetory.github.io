from bomb.com and in this video I'm
going to show you how to do one of my
favorite features an Ice Cream Sandwich
and that's how to disable a app so you
can see right here I have two
calculators I have the one that comes
with the phone which is this your basic
old calculator and then I've downloaded
this scientific calculator from the
market so obviously this is the one I'd
rather use so I don't have a need for
two calculators in my phone so what I'm
going to do is actually disable this the
system calculator so I'm just going to
go over to my settings on Ice Cream
Sandwich so I'm just going to go from
the notification bar and what you're
going to do is scroll down to apps and
then because it is a system app and not
one I've downloaded I just go to all and
then I'm just gonna scroll down to
calculator and I'm gonna hit this
disabled button right over here so as
soon as I hit it I get a little pop-up
notification saying if you disable a
built-in app other apps may misbehave
and that's if it's related to other apps
in this case I'm never going to use the
calculator so let's hit OK and there you
go it's been disabled now I want to go
to my home screen you can see the icon
has been automatically removed and it's
also been removed from my launcher and
that's pretty much it that's how you see
it lapse thank forward to the video this
is david fumble calm and please don't
forget to visit phone with dr. hall for
more cellphone news reviews and how to's
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
