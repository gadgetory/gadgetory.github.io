this video I'm doing a speed comparison
test between the Samsung Galaxy s3 and
the left and the Apple iPhone 4s here on
the right this is actually a t-mobile's
variant as you can see and it's the
unlocked version of the iPhone so we'll
go ahead and start our first test which
is the boot up test press power at the
same time so one two three hold it for a
couple of seconds
there you go felt both phones vibrate
while cigars are loading up will let you
know that I did clear out the browsing
history on both phones so when I do the
browsing test it'll be very equal both
phones are running on same Wi-Fi network
both phones have their SIM cards pulled
out um and when I do the app speed
comparison test you know I'll be loading
up the same apps by the same developers
but keep in mind that they are different
OSS so it's not gonna be a reflection of
just pure processing power it's going to
be a reflection of you know how each OS
is optimized iPhone 4s showed the
lockscreen first we're going to unlock
both phones for at the same time and I
will go to the phone application just to
see know which one is downloading first
you can see that the iPhone did look
like it is like a few seconds you know
ahead of our second or so ahead of the
galaxy s3 so we'll give it the wind but
honestly my own test that I've done
before this video you know one boot up
test the galaxy s 301 and the other one
the iPhone 4 will win so honestly it's
more close to a draw but more
consistently die phone worn so I give it
the win here let's go ahead and go to
the first app speed test so we'll go to
we'll do score center first so one two
three and you can see that the iPhone
did finish up first loading give me an O
SIM card error which a day Android has
given me for a while now so we'll go
ahead and close it out on both phones so
actually gotta go like this obviously
the iPhone just really depositing the
apps in the background but I'm doing it
more or less for the galaxy s3 sake
because the galaxy is gonna be running
them in the background so we'll go to
the next test which will be the Flixster
test so go ahead and find Flixster one
two three load it up first on the iPhone
4s in this case so the iPhone gets its
second win so it loaded up
score Center faster and it loaded up
Flixter faster so two wins for in that
category and the next app speed test
I'll do is the dictionary app so
dictionary on both phones one two three
and there you go you can see that the
galaxy s3 did load up the dictionary at
faster so guys first win for the app
speed comparison and I'll go ahead and
close this out
close the paused app out and remove it
from there and just let you know
removing it does actually take it out as
you see my task manager shows no running
applications because I closed out from
that list the next test I'll do is uh
let's just do the game Temple Run so tap
one on here got Temple Run right here on
this guy so I'll tap them at the same
time one two three and it looks like the
iPhone is a little bit ahead you see it
has my paused game which I had a
horrible score on and this one did too
but obviously the wind does go to the
iPhone for us here again keep in mind
you know I feel like iOS is a faster you
know are more optimized the West and
Android is hopefully that changes with
Android 4.1 jelly bean which I was just
announced today by the way and you know
Google said that they made a lot more or
a lot more buttery smooth is out there
work so anyway I will go ahead and go to
the next test
which will be the camera load up test so
I'll go ahead and load up the camera on
both phones at the same time to see you
know which ones going to show the
viewfinder first so one two three
and again the iPhone 4s loaded up just a
little bit faster than the Galaxy s3 so
overwhelming from those apps we test the
clear winner is the iPhone 4s we'll go
ahead and close it out here and we'll go
on to the next test which is the browser
speed test and that this one is actually
the biggest you know reflection of
actual processing power because the OS
doesn't make as much of a difference
here
um we'll go ahead and close this guy out
I don't know why that's showing I'll go
to clear out the history just in case I
forgot thought I cleared it out but you
know what I'd rather be safe than sorry
so we'll go to Safari clear it out
really quick go back home and let's do
the same one here just
in case so go here privacy insecurity
clear history clear cache all right now
we're back and now let's go to fumble
comm for the first test I'll go and type
in phone bluff
all right so type in Pokemon both phones
I'm gonna hit go at one two three and
they're off so let's go to see the
iPhone is showing up more content first
the Galaxy s3 is still loading they got
a Galaxy s3 is done and now the iPhone
4s is done you can see in a notification
bar it's showing a little circle so
diving for our the galaxy s3 definitely
was the winner here we'll go ahead and
load up an article we'll load up
how to set contact specific ringtones on
the iPhone was tapped right here one two
three again the iPhone seems to be
showing the content first but in this
case you see is still loading it seems
like the galaxy s3 is actually loading
up the whole page first so overall the
wind goes to the galaxy s3 for phone
buff let's go to let's do NFL comm
really quick and hit go at the same time
so one two three and that was really
close I think they finished just about
the same time again it seems like the
iPhone 4s loads it up in a different way
where it shows the content first and
that on the galaxy s3 doesn't show the
content first but then all of a sudden
all that comes on the train so really
makes it really tough to call um well
hook got it go ahead and hit desktop at
the same time on both these guys so we
have the full version one two three and
there you go the galaxy s3 is done now
the iPhone 4s is actually done or says
it's done but it's still loading things
up in the background so um the wind
clearly does go to the galaxy s3 and
overall you know it's the faster browser
and you know I feel like you actually
get a better browsing experience even
with a bigger screen and the higher
resolution so anyway that's the speed
comparison test um you know if you lie
feel like iOS really makes a difference
for the app speed and maybe the boot up
test when it comes to those tests but
the sheer processing power goes to the
galaxy s3 for sure with the 1.5 gb
dual-core processor the s4 compared to
the 800-meter a5 and also you got 2 gigs
of ram with only 512 but anyway that's
it for me in this video hopefully this
is a better idea as far as the
performance differences between these
two devices I've found helpful please
