out there right now okay the rumor mill
has been turning out new rumors left and
right and if even half these rumors turn
out to be true the next iPhone will
likely be one of the most exciting new
iPhones in years now we'll start off by
talking about the new models as you guys
know Apple's naming scheme has been
pretty consistent over the years with
the iPhone 5 5 s 6 6 s 7 and yes there
will probably be a 4.7 inch iPhone 7s
and a 5.5 inch iPhone 7s plus the 7s is
expected to be your typical s upgrade
and that's cool in all but that's not
what has me excited
you see 2017 is also the 10-year
anniversary for the iPhone itself which
Apple first launched back in 2007 with
the iPhone 2g so you just know that
Apple has something big planned and that
big plan may come in the form of a third
model a higher-end model currently
rumored to be called the iPhone 8 this
higher-end iPhone is going to be
different first off it's rumored to have
a 5.8 inch OLED display Apple reportedly
has already inked a deal with Samsung to
produce these OLED displays which should
provide a better contrast ratio and be
more energy efficient than the LCD
displays the Apple is currently using
and yes you heard me correctly the
screen size is rumoured to be up to 5
point 8 inches now if you've ever
compared a 5.5 inch iPhone 6 or 7 plus
two other 5.5 inch smart phones like the
galaxy s7 edge you know that the iPhone
is a lot bigger due to having these
really big bezels so a bigger screen on
an iPhone kind of seems like a bad idea
but here's the thing Apple just may make
up for the years of having huge bezels
on its phones with an iPhone 8 with
virtually no bezels we're talking less
bezel than the galaxy s 8 and the LG G 6
to the point where a 5.8 inch screen
could fit into a device that's roughly
the same size as a 4.7 inch iPhone
however while this rumor of a nearly
bezel açaí phone sounds amazing for it
to actually become a reality a few
things need to happen for
on the iconic home button that has been
a staple of the iPhones design since day
one will have to go we've already seen
several Android manufacturers do this
already with them moving the fingerprint
scanner from the front of the phone over
to the back but the rumor is that Apple
won't be doing the same with them
instead innovating the fingerprint
scanner right into the iPhone 8 display
itself sounds pretty far-fetched right
but when you consider that companies
like synaptics have developed
fingerprint scanners that work under
glass and that Apple itself already has
patents that describe being print
sensors that work through a display all
of a sudden it seems a little bit more
likely after that the patent that Apple
has for integrating and ambient light
sensor into the display and a nearly
bezel if iPhone AIDS might just be a
thing of course I don't think they'll be
able to integrate a front-facing camera
into the display any time soon so there
will probably be at least a little basil
at the top but who knows now speaking of
the front-facing camera it's supposedly
going to get a big upgrade the rumor is
that the front-facing camera will have
3d sensing capabilities using technology
from a company called prime sense which
Apple actually acquired back in 2013 for
context prime senses the company that
played a big role in helping Microsoft
develop the Kinect sensor for the Xbox
360 what exactly these 3d sensing
capabilities will be used for on the
iPhone is largely unknown at this point
but there's a good chance that the
iPhone 8 will have either iris scanning
like we've seen on phones like the note
7 or even facial recognition there's
also a possibility that Apple have an
API for developers to use this new
sensor for augmented reality functions
from helping you find the right size for
your clothes to scanning your head and
putting your face in a video game going
back to the display since the physical
home button will likely get the boots
the bottom part of the 5.8 inch display
will likely be used for a functional
area making the actual usable portion of
the screen roughly 5.2 inches again
we've seen Android phones do the same
thing with on-screen buttons but since
iOS doesn't have a back or a recent key
like Android does the bottom strip will
likely act more like the touch bar on
the new MacBook Pro which may be even
more useful on an iPhone than on a
MacBook once Apple opens it up to
developers now if you stop and think
about it for a second
the not so game-changing features in
previous iPhones have kind of been
slowly leading up to this touch bar you
have 3d touch from the iPhone success
which so far hasn't been all that it's
cracked up to be but all of a sudden it
becomes really useful as it will help
differentiate between things like a
DoubleTap on the virtual home button for
each ability and a double press of the
virtual home button for Siri but 3d
touch alone wouldn't be enough to make
this work just try 3d touching the
camera app on your iPhone 6s or seven
and you'll see what I'm talking about
it just feels awkward pushing hard into
the screen twice but yet a double press
on the iPhone 7 solid state hobo and
doesn't feel awkward thanks largely to
the improved taptic engine that came
with the iPhone 7
that makes it feel like you actually
double-clicking a physical button so I'm
excited about the touch bar I really
hope that this rumor turns out to be
true and if it does it could be that
game-changer that Apple has been looking
for in terms of design in addition to
the bezel is fronts the back of the
iPhone 8 may feature glass instead of
aluminum like the last four iPhones have
had with a stainless steel frame like we
saw on the iPhone 4s now love it or hate
it glass backs do offer some benefits
like better wireless signal and the
ability to wirelessly charge we've
already seen Apple implement wireless
charging on the Apple watch so it
wouldn't come as too much of a surprise
if the iPhone eight ends up supporting
it too speaking of charging there was
recently a big new rumor that the iPhone
may end up dishing the Lightning port in
favor of a USB type-c port now if this
turns out to be true this would be a
huge departure from what Apple has ever
done with the iPhone adopting an
industry standard charging port instead
of its own proprietary one that's never
happened before and to be honest I have
my doubts
sure Apple has a very real problem with
the fact that if you go into an Apple
store today and you buy the latest
iPhone and the latest MacBook you can't
connect it to without using an adapter
but I just can't see Apple doing what
every other manufacturer has done and
use an industry standard it just doesn't
seem like something Apple would do not
to mention that they can make money off
of it with their MFI or made for iPhone
licensing program so I think the more
likely solution to Apple's domville
problem is
changing the regular lightning to USB
type a cable that comes in the box to a
lightning to USB type-c cable this way
consumers can connect their new iPhone
to the new MacBooks and Apple gets to
keep making money off of their lightning
accessories which seems much more like
something Apple would do either way
because of USB type-c the iPhone 8 is
rumored to also support fast charging
which honestly if you've never had a
phone with fast charging its a really
big deal okay let's just use and talk
about performance as always the new
iPhone is expected to get a faster and
more energy-efficient processor in the
811 chip you don't really need a rumor
or leak to tell you that that's common
sense but it is worth noting that the
Meucci is rumored to be designed with a
10 nanometer process which will help the
a11 deliver those increases in
performance and efficiency rumor has it
that the iPhone 8 will also come with
three gigabytes of RAM like on the
iPhone 7 plus which thanks to iOS is RAM
management is kind of like having 6
gigabytes of RAM on Android at least
when it comes to absolutely in terms of
battery life things are kind of up in
the air you have a bigger screen a bunch
of new features and a smaller overall
device which usually means a smaller
battery so if anything you'd expect
battery life to be worse but some rumor
suggests that the iPhone 8 will actually
have better battery life thanks in part
to the more efficient OLED display the
more efficient a 11 processor and get
this a bigger battery now you may be
thinking how will I have a bigger
battery right light but that sounds
crazy but the rumour says that despite
its smaller overall size with the help
of a stacked logic board design and an
l-shaped 2 cell battery pack
we're talking a 2700 milliamp hour
battery over a nineteen hundred and
sixty million battery and the iPhone 7
to put that into perspective the bigger
iPhone 7 plus had a 2900 million
batteries and that thing lasts all day
long so if Apple can actually pull this
off man the iPhone 8 is going to be
really hard to beat now there hasn't
been a whole lot of rumors about the
rear cameras on the iPhone 8 yet so it's
possible that we'll see a largely
unchanged dual camera system with only
slight improvements in low-light
capabilities and maybe optical image
stabilization on both the wide and the
TEL
for the lens where the iPhone 7 plus
only had oh is for the wide lens other
things you can probably expect from the
iPhone aids or in improved ip68 water
resistance rating over IP 67 which
basically translates into being able to
submerge the phone in up to 1.5 meters
of water for 30 minutes compared to just
one meter of water for 30 minutes not a
big deal I know but maybe it'll give you
a little bit more confidence to take the
phone into the shower with you Siri
should also be getting smarter with
apples acquisition of tearing an AI
company based out of Seattle which came
just in time as competition from
Google's assistance and Samsung's Bixby
is heating up and there's a chance that
the OLED display will be curved just
like the 2.5 D glass on the iPhone 7 is
curved right now so like not galaxy s7
edge curve but 2.5 D curves like on the
iPhone so don't get too excited the
iPhone 8 is expected to be announced and
launched in September alongside the
iPhone 7s and 7s Plus which again are
rumours looks similar to the seven but
will have a lot of the new features that
are coming with the 8 of course not all
the features coming to the iPhone 8 will
be on the 7s as Apple will likely try to
distinguish the ADEs from the other two
since rumors suggest that Apple plans on
selling the iPhone 8 for upwards of
$1,000 now that's a lot of money but
then again if these rumors pan out
you'll be kind of getting what you pay
for
otherwise there will still be the option
for the 7s and the 7s Plus which should
sell for somewhere around what the
current iPhones are selling for now
however just to reiterate everything
here is based off of rumors and
speculation and nothing is official
until Apple announces the phone later
this year if you want to stay updated on
the latest rumors and leaks from the
iPhone 8 hit that subscribe button give
this video a thumbs up if you liked it
and as always I'll see you in the very
next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
