and where I get to ask you guys weekly
questions via polls on our Facebook fan
page you can be a part of the polls by
liking us on Facebook and get your
questions answered in upcoming videos by
asking us on Twitter I'll pull all the
links you need down below but with that
said let's go ahead and get started
Terrain asks hey my ask for is getting a
little bit slower can you please tell me
how to speed up the phone okay so I
already made a video covering the top
five speed tips to make your Android
phone faster which I'll link down in the
description box below but for the s4
specifically I'd recommend turning off
some of those s features that you may
not even be using disable to double tap
for SOS feature on the home button and
try restarting your phone every once in
a while to help clear out the RAM these
tips in addition to the top five I tell
you about in the other video should
definitely help boost your performance
just a little bit kamal asks why doesn't
no Kia use Android they would have
demolished Samsung a long time ago
there's no question that Nokia or Nakia
can make an incredible Android phone I
mean the high-end Lumias the company has
put out so far have great build quality
absolutely amazing cameras solid
speakers in just about everything else
you'd want in a smart phone when it
comes to hardware which leaves thousands
of Nokia fans like you wondering why the
company doesn't just go ahead and make
an Android powered Lumia well while the
possibility of Nokia making an Android
phone will technically always exist the
likelihood of it actually happening
unfortunately isn't all that great why
well it really comes down to the
business side of things
Nokia decided a long time ago that it
would have a better chance of success by
partnering with Microsoft and being the
leader on the Windows Phone platform
compared to fighting for second or maybe
even third place on Android behind
Samsung which by the way just completely
dominates Android right now
being responsible for nearly 95 percent
of the profits earned from selling
Android phones in the first quarter now
think about that number for just a
second if samsung was responsible for
95% of the
in the first quarter that means a
company like Nokia would have to
differentiate itself from all the other
Android manufacturers like LG Sony HTC
while way etc who are all scratching and
clawing for that remaining 5% and on
that note that Nokia could have
demolished Samsung a long time ago
all you have to do is just take one look
at a company like HTC and the struggles
has had financially despite making
arguably some of the best Android phones
out and you quickly realize that maybe
Nokia made the right decision by going
with Windows Phone and partnering with
the company with deep pockets like
Microsoft Samson this has too much of a
grip in the android market right now for
someone to come in and beat it anytime
soon and considering that Nokia sold
more phones than anyone once upon a time
their best shot at reclaiming that title
might just be with Microsoft in the
corner Jason asks what do you think
about the rumors that the iPhone 5s will
have a fingerprint scanner rumors about
the iPhone 5s having a fingerprint
scanner have been going around for a
really really long time now so I'd be
kind of surprised if they don't turn out
being true but as of right now most of
the rumors point to the home button
doubling as a scanner itself allowing
you to just swipe your finger down the
button to potentially unlock your phone
now that in it of itself is really
really exciting and should make the
process of unlocking your phone a lot
more convenient than your traditional
password but I think that's only
scratching the surface of what a
fingerprint scanner would actually bring
to the table I can see the fingerprint
scanner being used for things like
activating different user profiles
automatically entering in stored
passwords being used to make payments on
NFC with passbook or potentially NFC if
the iPhone 5s supports it and a whole
lot more in short I think it'll be that
big innovation that Apple has been
looking for so long as they implement it
in the right ways with that said though
they may or may not be the first ones to
come to market with it considering that
recent leaks suggest that the HTC One
Maxx will have a fingerprint scanner and
it might be announced on September 4th
so it's gonna be interesting see what
happens but I think Apple will have a
much better ability to implement it
since it does control iOS completely
whereas HTC you know only has their skin
and they don't control Android as a
whole is DVF on both coms weekly poll
what are the most important specs in a
smart phone I'll let you guys vote for
up to three things and the top three
specs you guys voted for as the most
are in order the battery at number one
the processor at number two and finally
the display at number three as far as
the results go I have to say that I
agree with you guys if I could only
control up to three specs on a
smartphone I think those would be the
ones I'd choose but if I had up to five
specs I could control I think I'd go
with Ram and probably the camera next up
on my list but I don't know what would
be your top five let me know down in the
comments below all right guys this is it
for me in this episode of Fung Bluff Q
