years we've done a series of videos here
on the channel where we take a look at
50 different voice commands a virtual
assistant can do we did a video for
Google for Siri for Alexa and we even
did one for Cortana but today it's big
speech turn so big thanks to Samsung for
sponsoring this video it's a video that
Abby wanted to do for a while now so I'm
excited we can finally bring it to you
because Bixby is a lot different
compared to the other assistants I mean
it can answer your typical questions
like what's the weather but really what
makes Bixby unique is it gives you more
control over the phone itself you'll see
more of what I'm talking about as we go
through the list so well with that said
hi Bixby are you ready let's do this 50
voice commands coming right up alright
so the first set of commands we'll go
over are the ones that help you manage
your phone calls and your messages
directly so hi Bixby add Michael Jordan
to my contacts with his phone number
being three one two five five five nine
one 77 okay it's been added call Michael
Jordan on speakerphone block the last
number who called me you can tap or say
block
what's Pizza Hut's phone number done I
found 21 such contacts let's choose one
now read me my last text message here
you go
it's from Jasmin got stuck in
construction traffic be home soon
deletes all text messages with the word
password do you want to delete a message
yes
all right it's deleted hi Bixby take a
screenshot and send it to John with
messages would you like to send a
message now what's cool is that this
type of in-app control isn't just
limited to system apps or like Samsung's
own apps it also works with some
third-party apps like Instagram for
example I don't actually have Instagram
installed right now so hi Bixby download
Instagram from the App Store all right
I'm downloading it post the last photo I
took to Instagram with the caption best
meal ever
let's check first then tap the button to
share open Facebook and post happy
birthday on Jasmin's wall you can tap or
say post open YouTube and search phone
buff sure let's check out what I found
open google play music and set a 20
minute timer got it I set the timer look
for Asian grocery stores on Yelp got it
here's what I found
get me an uber from here 288 ranch
let's pick a destination give the uber
driver five stars and comments thank you
you can check first then tap the button
to submit okay so as you can see we
picked up a couple of things and that is
because Bixby also has vision we're
using the camera it can help you
identify what you're looking at so for
example tell me more about this wine and
there you go using Vivino it gives you
all the information and reviews that you
need which can definitely make your
purchasing decision at the store a lot
easier but maybe even more impressive
with bixie vision is this ability to
translate text so scan this text and
translate and boom just like that it
automatically detected what language was
in and they translate it for us so
really impressive and uh in addition to
busy vision big speaking also used your
camera and your photos to do other
things like hi big speed open the camera
and take a panorama photo delete the
last three photos I took let's see I
found three photos you can check first
then tap or send elite show me the
gallery Trash folder sure let's take a
look at the Trash folder here show me
photos from San Diego looks like I found
seven pictures create an animation from
my last per shot
you can edit first then tap or say save
so it automatically made a gift for us
which you know is pretty cool of course
vics we can also do your more typical
things that you want an assistant to do
like reminding you of stuff so hi Bixby
remind me to get gas when I leave the
office got it I'll remind you about that
start recording a voice memo taking
notes and say don't do that again got it
take a look and we'll save it in my most
recent reminder to the always-on display
sure
let's check before setting this as your
always-on display so you can see that
that reminder is right there on the
screen when the screen is locked and
your other reminders and things like
your calendar events will also show up
in Bixby home so you can access that by
swiping over to the left or pressing on
that dedicated button and basically you
get content that's featured from your
apps things that big sweet things that
you're gonna want like sometimes I'll
show you a override that it thinks
you're gonna take and all sorts of other
stuff but going back to the commands we
have one more reminder which I thought
was pretty cool
in high bixby remember where I parked my
car or sure I've memorized where you
parked for later now for certain
commands you might find yourself using
them more often than others and for
those commands Bixby actually lets you
create quick Mane's that can help you
make things just a little bit easier so
for that remember where I parked my car
recommend that we just used we can
actually change it to something a little
bit easier something a little bit
shorter like parking spot so now when
you say hi Bixby
parking spot okay I memorized where you
park and boom just like that with a
shorter command you get the same exact
result that you would have with the
longer command so it's something that's
really useful and you can use it for any
single command that you want anyway
that we went over and any of the ones
that we're going to go over in just a
bit so speaking of that hi Bixby how
long will my battery last all right
looks like the estimated battery life is
10 hours 23 minutes
how long until my phone is fully charged
all right
it'll be charged in 1 hour 24 minutes
keep my screen on for 10 minutes ok I've
set it to 10 minutes optimize my phone's
performance okay optimizing now awesome
your phone rating is excellent turn on
the flashlight okay I turned it on turn
on the Wi-Fi hotspot got it hotspot is
turned on pair a bluetooth device got it
let's choose a device to connect you
here open my files app and show me my
download folder done that category is
right here show me my most recent app
and split screen view all right here's
the app delete my browsing history let's
select the ones you want to delete open
a private tab in the browser okay I
turned on secret mode hide tinder sure
thing I hid tinder you may be thinking
like those are grades but what about the
more basic commands that are still
really useful
well base we can do those too so hi
Bixby start a 25 minute timer okay it
started what time will the Sun set the
current time for
sunset in Temecula is 619 p.m. what is
25 centimeters in inches the answer is
nine point eight four two five one nine
six eighty-five start the stopwatch sure
I've started it change my 7:00 a.m.
alarm to 8:00 a.m. you got it I edited
your alarm find the nearest coffee shop
okay let's take a look at the search
results what's the traffic like to
Irvine all right here's the routes
adjusted by Google Maps you know while
it's nice that big we can do these
things again what really makes Big Z
unique is its ability to control your
phone and your apps so we'll go ahead
and finish off with those so hi Bixby
search for all unread emails and mark
them as read okay I marked that email as
read measure my heart rate okay
let's measure your heart rate how many
steps have I taken today all right
you walked 57 steps all right so there
you go those are fifty Bixby voice
commands
I obviously need to get my steps in so
