little bit later so pretty cool oh oh my
got a strike right outside this cage
holy crap Jay Jay what's up guys david
adjey here in today's episode what's up
with your voice lose my voice man do you
want me to do the intro yeah go ahead
okay all right here we go hey guys so as
you can tell David is losing his voice
but nonetheless in this episode epic rap
we're going to be taking a look at a
virtual reality game called rocket Oz on
the gear VR now because of the game you
know there's gonna be a challenge and
when there's a challenge a winner wins
and a loser suffers stop pointing at me
and today's unusual act of cruelty
whoever loses will have to read a
children's book with a mouthful of
peanut butter I am Batman alright guys
let's go ahead and get right into it
start June
okay gosh I can't give it all go
oh good come on no no no please if we
just give one more rocket we didn't want
to lose this one I guess before I start
to get I want to look around a bit
because this is pretty amazing I
seriously feel like I'm in Space Jam
swatch teacher Amma
why the Jetsons
400 thank you such a high score okay
so already around 2:00 and I'm at 600 so
Davis prediction is way off
I am literally for the sake of a theme I
am lightyears ahead of David now victory
around Rockets away everyone Rockets
away uh so buy one finally I was hoping
to go like three you know our little
series before we do the challenge we're
gonna go in and talk about the game so
overall what your what your takes an app
it's an app it's I've been messing
around with VR for a long time and still
it's my favorite it's my favorite game
it's my favorite game on there yeah it
makes you feel like you're in a this
feels real yeah I would say the biggest
draw for that game is production value
you know gameplay - sound design - I
mean it's miss aesthetics it's made by
oculus so let's maybe I'll kind of I
guess it's kind of expected but I mean
that's the way we are should be done
yeah the other question we need the
answer is can you get a Disneyland like
experience while playing this game and
did you yeah it it totally reminds me of
that that one ride at Disneyland sorry
ride Toy Story Toy Story Mania the
shooting game he's right I mean like
it's it's it really does feel like you
get that really cool crisp VR experience
at home at home or in the office on the
stupid head office or on the street or
in a boat
it doesn't matter hey are in a chain
with no voice I don't know why in this
challenge he's reading a children's book
which if you guys remember from our
Alexa video will be green eggs and ham
he's gonna read the last three pages of
green eggs and ham so I go out and hold
on to that sir and of course as promised
we're gonna do that peanut butter
challenge okay like don't be like too
crazy
what that's not that bad
that's not that bad you're otherwise
they eat it all right you're so annoying
I'm waiting for my book and I will
