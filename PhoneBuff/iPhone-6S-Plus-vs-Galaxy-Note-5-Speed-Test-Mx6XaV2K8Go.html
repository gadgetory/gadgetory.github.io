we did a film of style speed test the
galaxy note 5 beat out both the g4 and
the oneplus 2 so today it's going to
defend its title as the reigning speed
test champ against what I guess you can
call the number one contender in the
iPhone 6s plus so that way we can see
which one of these top the line
smartphones offers the best performance
let's go ahead and get right into it
alright so we'll get this thing going by
starting these stopwatches on each phone
and then jump into these system apps
like the camera and the gallery where
the Galaxy Note fires faster animations
give it a slight edge over the iPhone 6s
plus but going into Temple Run 2 it
looks like the success plus has caught
up with both phones being neck-and-neck
heading into Angry Birds now it is worth
noting that the no 5s display is packin
more pixels in these success pluses
which may or may not make a difference
during the gaming portion of this test
but either way the iPhone with this a 9
chip takes the slight lead over the note
5 working on Photoshop mix and then
heading into the score the note 5 is
literally just a split second behind
making this one of the closest matchups
we've seen so far the last light of this
first lap is loading up both the mobile
and the full versions of the Amazon
website and it looks like the 6 plus is
gonna hold on to a split second lead
finishing up the first stop at the time
of 49 seconds with no fire finishing
just two seconds later at 51 seconds so
the question going into this
multitasking lap was how would the two
gigabytes of RAM on the 6s plus stack up
against the 4 gigabytes of RAM on the
note 5 and as you can see the 6s plus
handles multitasking perfectly with
their having all the apps ready to go in
the background giving it a huge lead
with it crossing the finish line with a
time of 1 minute and 13 seconds and
despite having double the amount of RAM
at 4 gigabytes the galaxy note 5 still
had to reload most of the apps in the
second lap which obviously costed
greatly with it finishing 16 seconds
after the success plus with a total time
of 1 minute and 29 alright so same old
story with the note 5 the Exynos chip
does great during that first lap where
we initially load up the apps but in the
second lap for whatever reason TouchWiz
doesn't keep all the apps open
background despite having four gigabytes
of RAM to work with but I think the
bigger story here is that the iPhone 6s
plus not only cruise through that second
lap like we've seen a couple of devices
do before but it also beat the note five
in that first lap as well now I know
what some of you guys may be thinking so
what the 6s plus only beat the note by
by two seconds in that first lap and
fair enough but when you consider that
note five beat both g4 and the one plus
two
despite its RAM management issues and
you take a look at the spec sheets on
those devices it really starts to put
into perspective how much faster these
6s plus is compared to pretty much any
other smartphone so I can't wait to see
which phone eventually dethrones these
6s plus from its current position as the
phone book style speed test champ
alright that is it for me in this video
be sure to subscribe to their channel
for more speed tests just like this and
up I'll see you guys in the very next
episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
