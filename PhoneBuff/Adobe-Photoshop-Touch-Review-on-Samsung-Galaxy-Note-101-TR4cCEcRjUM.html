bluff calm and in this video we're doing
a review on the Adobe Photoshop Touch
app available on Android and on iOS this
version however is on Android as you
have to see I have my Samsung Galaxy
Note 10.1 which Photoshop actually came
pre-installed with otherwise it's $9.99
from your OS is the respective app store
I'll go ahead and talk about you know
some of the features that comes with it
compared to how it is on the computer
and also how I like it so first up us go
into something I really like which is
this tutorials so you can see you have a
whole bunch of drawers here you actually
have 15 so you have 15 different effects
or 15 different things you could
actually do with this Photoshop Touch
application so I'm just gonna go ahead
and choose one out walk you through and
show you how exactly you know the
tutorial goes and in the process shows
you some of the features that you could
do so for example in this tutorial is
going to teach us how to replace colors
we're going to change the red stop sign
to a blue stop sign so pretty simple my
hit began tutorial and you see at the
bottom it says tap the toolbar and
scroll to the magic wand tool so
basically it's going to walk me through
step-by-step on how to do it really cool
feature here so you see that says it
points out the magic wand tools on the
tap on this guy and now that I know how
it looks because a little icon I'll tap
on it and it says step one I'll tap next
and say tap tolerance increase the
tolerance to 50% so you can see
tolerance is right over here it's a now
I'll just leave it at right there 54% is
good enough we'll go to the next step
which is tap the red area of the sign to
select it so I'll just tap on the red
area you can see it's been selected
somewhat I'll hit next it says tap the
add to selection icon and tap the areas
inside the o and the P of the stop sign
so I'm just going to hit the add to
selection button and I love the way it
points it out to me on the tap inside
the Oh like it asked me to and inside
the P on my hit next and it says tap the
adjustments color balance enter red you
know it gives me the settings put in so
I'm going to tap color balance over here
so I'm just going to hit the settings
then I look for
color balance and say for example I
forgot you know what it just said I can
hit this little light bulb and it'll
tell me exactly where to go so a pretty
cool feature there and from here I'm
gonna enter in the settings so red it's
going to go to negative 100 green
negative 100 blue to positive 100
already change it because I already went
through this tutorial before but I'll
just hit apply and then hit next on the
slowest tutorial so let's tap select and
deselect so select deselect and close
the scroll up so basically this tutorial
completed you have reached the end so
I'm not going to close now you can see
the effect obviously you can zoom in and
zoom out too so really cool especially
with this s-pen if you're using the
Galaxy Note 10.1 makes it really easier
if you have some kind of stylus because
I'll go ahead and back out of here and
now let's go ahead and close the
tutorial and start another one that
requires a little bit more precision so
for example to clean up a background so
for example it wants me to take this
picture originally with these two people
in the background and remove them
without making it look like I did so you
hit begins tutorial this one seems a
little more advanced
it's a zoom in on the woman's head so
it's really nice to have it to be able
to do this on a tablet because I feel
like it's a little bit quicker
obviously I've used you know photoshop
on computers a lot but with the s-pen
and the touchscreen interface it's just
a lot faster so for example it says tap
on them and then select the lasso like
on some one click here hit the lasso and
it says draw a selection around her head
and upper right arm so her head right
over here so what's cool is with this I
could actually a lot more precise than I
am with the mouse I know that you know
on the computer you could use a little
adapter that lets you use your like hand
drawing to be able to select things
which is cool a lot of artists and
graphic designers actually have that I
don't have that because I'm not that
serious when it comes to photoshop but
to be able to do it that well on here is
pretty cool
hit next and says add to selection so
anything I missed up you know what I'll
find I don't need to do that step and
ask me to feather something and set a
value of 1px so I'll just hit feather
1px so set it to 1 hit OK and I'll just
kind of walk through and give you ideas
far as more of the future so it says
in verse to protect the r-selection we
made some a inverse so now when I mess
with everything outside of it it's not
going to mess with what I have selected
zoom out of the image so even tells you
how to zoom out by you know
pinching out choose the clone stamp tool
will choose it hit next tap the source
button so source and select the center
of the water between the two men
so here the two men center of the water
is right about there so mate source
again tap right there and then says use
the clone stamp to cover the man and the
woman in the background reset the source
as needed so I'm a brush and I'm just
going to tap on this guy and you can see
he is slowly being deleted basically
with water now I need to reset the
source because his head didn't get
replaced so I might tap right over here
and then brush again and you see now his
head's gone I would consider Lee do that
throughout the whole picture until
everything is gone not going to do that
here because then take quite a while but
you guys can see it is pretty easy to do
with this pen whole bunch of tutorials
which I absolutely love now let's go
back and go into the other options you
have you up here so you could tap this
guy to go to the Creative Cloud for with
Adobe you tap right here to set
something as your galaxy to your gallery
share it on Facebook share by email and
also upload it to the Creative Cloud hit
the folder if you want to add a new
folder move projects around if you want
to duplicate our project you're working
on so if you want to go maybe two
different ways with a current project
you could do that tap right here
obviously to delete a project share on
Facebook and it's going to ask you to
sign in don't want to do that right now
but go to the settings you kind of have
the same options here as far as you know
your preferences you could decide the
resolution that you want my tablet's
resolution is 1600 s I'm gonna leave it
at that
I can login to Facebook like I had
earlier help and about basically so
nothing really much in the settings
pretty much everything you need is right
over here in these toolbars at the
bottom you can start a new project right
here select the size of the canvas is
automatically go to the size of my
screen - this part of the screen which
is used for the home button and
notification bar if I wanted to add a
picture that I already have on my tablet
for example I have this one i'ma hit add
and I'll be able to photoshop this
obviously this is a screenshot of my of
my screen I'll actually don't have any
pictures on here but if you did you'd be
able to do all the effects that you're
used to - for example you tap this how
you get crop change the image size
rotate it around so I'll just do rotate
and you know I'll rotate it I'll flip it
counterclockwise and then all those
things that you'd want to do with your
pictures that means really nice to be
able to have a sunny tablet
honestly I feel like this is just as
functional as I mean not just functional
but pretty close to the functionality as
the version I have on my computer and
this is one of the applications you know
that you know I really couldn't say that
my smart phone or my tablet before could
replace my computer outright because
Photoshop is one of those applications
that I use on a daily basis for phone
buff when I you know upload pictures and
things like that but with this
application the only real thing I need
is a good video editing software on a
tablet then I'll truly be able to
replace my computer needs on with a
tablet right now obviously I can because
the video editing isn't there but it's
nice to see that the photo editing is
there definitely recommend it I mean if
you're going to edit a lot of pictures
on your tablet you're really into that
and you want to learn more and this is a
honestly a great way to learn how to do
these effects because it does help out
them you can add people's tattoos and
you know you can make a picture look old
and all that stuff and a whole bunch
more these are just such tutorials they
include so anyway that's pretty much my
quick walkthrough review of the
Photoshop application I do like it a lot
you know I definitely recommend it at
$9.99 I definitely think it's a fair
price considering you know a lot of
these features that come available on
the computer version which is you know
over $200 so definitely worth the money
in my opinion if you get the galaxy note
10.1 it's even better it comes
pre-installed so it was actually free so
I got this guy for free really happy
with that but anyway that's it for me in
