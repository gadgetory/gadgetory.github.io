have a speed test between the best font
from Google and the pixel 3x so going up
against the best phone from Apple in the
iPhone 10's max taking a look at the
spec sheet the iPhone is powered by the
a12 Bionic chip coupled with 4 gigabytes
of RAM while the pixel is rocking
qualcomm snapdragon 845 and just like
the iPhone it also is packin 4 gigabytes
of RAM which you know I have to say is
kind of surprising that Google went with
4 gigabytes instead of something like 6
which most other ranger phones have but
at the same time the pixel probably is
running a leaner version of Android
compared to those other flagships and
it's one of the few Android phones
that's actually running on Android 9.0
so the question is will the pixel
software optimizations be enough to
overcome its seemingly limited hardware
or will the iPhone tennis max log yet
another victory against its Android
competition let's find out
alright we'll get things going by
starting the stopwatch is on each phone
and then jump into the first row where
the pixel 3 is able to get the step over
the iPhone loading both Facebook and
Starbucks at a faster rates as both
phones move on to word each is loading
the same exact 500 page documents with
iPhone being able to not only catch up
to the pixel but pass it moving on to
excel with the 10s max just blowing
through it and already moving on to the
second row so an impressive start for
the iPhone here in the first lap but the
pixel 3 still hasn't fallen too far
behind with it joining the iPhone here
in Snapseed where just like the iPhone
it'll edit that selfie that it just took
by adding a filter in expert in the
image out to storage where it looks like
the pixel did complete that task at a
slower rate allowing the iPhone to
improve on its lead as it just rips
through Premiere and already starts
working on the browser test with the
pixel expert in that video clip in
premiere at a slower rate as well
putting it a flap behind the iPhone
midway through this first lap so things
aren't looking so good for the pixel 3
but if you can manage to avoid giving up
any more ground to the iPhone here in
the gaming row it does have a shot at
making a comeback in the last row where
we'll be loading more lightweight
applications like Spotify
ESPN but unfortunately that doesn't look
like it's going to happen with the pixel
3 Excel taking significantly longer to
load both subway surfers and flip diving
and with things not looking any better
here in fit the fad along the iPhone 10s
max to pull even further ahead as it
finishes up with bullet force and moves
on to the last row where after quickly
loading up Spotify the iPhone is on its
way to turning that one athlete it has
over the pixel into a full-blown and to
athlete with it already moving on to
Netflix as the pixel struggles to finish
up with bullet force letting the iPhone
capture its biggest lead so far in the
speed test finishing the first lap with
a time of 1 minute and 46 seconds so as
the iPhone starts working on the second
lap the pixel is working on finishing
the first with it taking slightly longer
to load ESPN but being able to load both
Netflix and Amazon at a slightly faster
rates finishing the first lap 16 seconds
later with a time of 2 minutes and 2
seconds while the iPhone has been doing
an excellent job by keeping all the apps
open and ready to go unfortunately the
same can't be said of the pixel with it
failing to keep bullet force open which
is the first time in a really long time
that we've seen a phone failed to keep
an app open so early but we'll see if
the trend continues as the pixel moves
on to fit the fats where once again it
fails to keep the app open allowing the
iPhone to cruise to the finish line with
a total time of 2 minutes and 30 seconds
and us fast-forwarding the pixel to the
end where it fails to keep every single
app open finishing the test over a
minute later with a total time of 3
minutes and 35 seconds making the winner
by a huge margin the iPhone 10s
max in case you're wondering we ran this
test multiple times on each phone and
the results here were consistent anyways
that is it for me in this video thank
you guys for watching and as always I'll
see you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
