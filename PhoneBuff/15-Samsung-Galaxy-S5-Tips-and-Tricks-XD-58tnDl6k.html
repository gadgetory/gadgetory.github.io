pen samsung galaxy s5 is capable of
doing a lot of different things so in
this video i'm gonna be covering my top
15 tips and tricks that will hopefully
help you a most out of the galaxy s5 if
you already have it or at the very least
give you a better idea of what is
capable of doing if you don't let's go
ahead and get right into it alright so
since we're going to be spending a good
amount of time tinkering with the
settings in this video the first tip is
to change the way these settings are
actually displayed by opening them up
and pressing the three dotted Menu
button at the top right from here you
can select the view that you like the
most which in my case happens to be the
list view to something I recommend to
any galaxy s5 owner out there who
doesn't use s Voice's disabling the
double tap to S voice feature on the
home button do this by going into the
settings
tapping on s voice and then unchecking
the open via home key option this can
dramatically improve the responsiveness
of the home button as it will no longer
need to wait and see if you're double
tapping for s voice 3 speaking of the
home button when you press and hold on
it you get launched straight into Google
now pressing and holding on the apps
which will make it act as a dedicated
Menu button and pressing and holding on
the back key will toggle the multi
window mode on and off for one of the
best things about the Galaxy s5 is this
big 5.1 inch display but sometimes you
could get to be a little bit too big so
tip number four is to resize the screen
with a simple swipe in and out from
either edge of the display enable this
feature by going into settings
tapping on one-handed operation and
flicking the switch to the on position
the fifth tip is using the ultra power
saving mode to extend the Galaxy s5s
battery life from lasting anywhere
between a day or two all the way up to
well over a week do this by swiping down
on the notification bar tapping on the
view all button at the top right and
flicking on the ultra power saving
toggle now this isn't something they're
gonna want to do all the time as it
almost turns the Galaxy S five into a
basic flip phone but it's still a great
way to make sure your phone doesn't die
on you when you know you're going to be
away from a charger
for a long time six if you live in a
colder climate and one wear gloves while
using the Galaxy S five you can do so by
going into the main system settings
tapping on display and then checking the
increase touch sensitivity option which
will make this screen work much better
with gloves seven if you want to take a
screenshot on the Galaxy S five you can
do so by either pressing and holding on
the power and home button simultaneously
or by simply swiping the edge of your
palm across the screen which is the way
that I've personally found to be the
easiest eight you can hide apps from
showing up in the launcher by opening
the launcher hitting the Menu button at
the top right
tapping on hide abs checking all the
apps that you want to hide and then
hitting done to make them disappear nine
on the topic of hiding things if you
have a file like a picture a video that
you want to keep hidden you can do so by
turning on private mode by swiping down
the notification bar with two fingers
and turning on the private mode toggle
once private mode is on all you have to
do is go to the file you're trying to
hide press the menu button and then hit
move to private when you turn the
password-protected private mode off any
file that you moved into private will no
longer show up on the phone ten if
you've ever had your phone wake you up
in the middle of the night only for some
stupid notification turn out alone so
the tenth tip is to enable blocking mode
by going into the system settings
tapping on blocking mode and then
setting the switch to on from this menu
you can select exactly when you don't
want to be disturbed and what kind of
features you want to be blocked but if
house you ID be sure to specify which
contacts are allowed to wake you up in
case of an emergency
11 and speaking of emergencies if you
ever happen to run into trouble yourself
triple press the power button on the
Galaxy S five and it'll automatically
text to people on your emergency contact
list with your location a picture any
sound recording giving them a good idea
of where you are and what's happening to
you right away to enable this feature
and maybe even save your life in the
process go to the main system settings
tap on safety assistance then on send
help messages and then finally flip the
switch to the on position 12 a cool
little feature on the Galaxy s5 is
toolbox which is a persistent floating
menu that
you can tap on to access up to five
shortcuts from wherever you are you can
turn toolbox on via the notification
toggles and you can customize the
shortcuts that appear by going into
settings
tapping on toolbox tapping on edit
checking the apps that you want to show
up and then finally hitting save when
you're done using the features simply
press and hold on it
move it up to the remove option and let
go 13 while the Galaxy s5 has an LED
notification light for a stronger visual
cue that you have a new message go to
the main system settings then
accessibility tap on hearing and then
check the flash notification option to
have the flash on the back of the phone
light up whenever you get a new
notification 14 by default whenever you
swipe over to the left of the galaxy s5s
home screen you're taken to the my
magazine app if for whatever reason you
want to disable this pinch out while on
the home screen tap on the home screen
settings and uncheck the mine Magazine
option all right so the 15th and final
tip for this video is using the number
keys on the Samsung keyboard for your
own customizable shortcuts to do this go
into any app where you can see the
keyboard tap the Settings icon next to
the space bar and then tap on the my
shortcuts object from here you can set
up to 10 shortcuts one for each number
that are activated when you press and
hold on the respective number key you
can use your own commonly used phrases
or even information like your name and
address alright guys that's it for me in
