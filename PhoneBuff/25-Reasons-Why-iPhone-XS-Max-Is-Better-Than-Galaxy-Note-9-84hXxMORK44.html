10's max and the galaxy note 9 are both
really great smartphones that each have
their own unique set of advantages
so in this two-part foam buff style
video series we're gonna be looking at a
bunch of reasons why each of these
phones could be considered better than
the other in this video we're taking a
look at why the iPhone could be
considered better and in the next video
which I'll be linking for you down below
we're gonna be doing this same exact
thing with the notes after watching both
videos be sure to vote for which phone
you think has the stronger reasons but
with that said let's go ahead and get
right into it
applying a screen protector to your
phone isn't always easy and rarely
perfect so the folks of rats begin
created a better way to do it
with guaranteed alignments using a
custom design tray big thanks to
speaking for sponsoring today's episode
we're with easy fits you can install
their high quality screen protector in
three easy steps
just peel off the protective film put
the custom fit tray your phone and then
simply press down to get a perfect
alignment everytime the easy fit is
available for old and new iPhones from
the iPhone 8 and 8 plus to the iPhone 10
s and 10 R so click on that link down
below and get your iPhone the protection
it deserves reason number one taptic
engine the vibration motor on the iphone
offers a much wider range of frequencies
than the one on the notes so when you
interact with the a certain thing on the
screen the phone responds in a way that
feels a lot more natural to lockscreen
privacy on the iphone other people won't
be able to just pick up your phone and
read your missed notifications like text
messages or emails with the phone only
showing that sensitive information on
the lock screen after it verifies that
it's you that's looking at it with face
id3 intuitive interface you've probably
heard that the iphone is more intuitive
to use and just one of the many examples
of this is looking at the way folders
work on each phone so both phones show
you the apps inside of a folder before
you tap on them but the difference is on
the iphone the app show up exactly how
you'd expect them to with the
arrangement in the folder
the arrangement of the folder icon
whereas on the notes the apps don't
appear where you expect them to with the
arrangement of the folder icon being
completely different from the
arrangement in the folder itself again
this is just one of the many examples
that ultimately add up to a more
intuitive experience on the iPhone for
Apple stores if you have an issue with
your iPhone like a broken screen for
example you can just walk into one of
the hundreds of Apple stores around the
world and get the issue resolved usually
on the same day reason number five Wi-Fi
password sharing if you have your
friends come over to your house and you
both have iPhones you can share your
Wi-Fi password with them automatically
with a single tap by just having them
try to connect you'll get a prompt on
your phone asking you if you want to
allow them to connect and without
actually having to give them the
password itself they'll be connected
automatically six continuity if you own
a Mac or an iPad the iPhone has the
advantage of allowing you to move
seamlessly between your devices you can
do things like answering a phone call on
your iPad to starting a hotspot using
your iPhone on your Mac seven complete
phone backup if you get a new iPhone
whether it's a replacement or an upgrade
getting all of your things transferred
over is easy via iCloud or iTunes and
unlike the backup options on Android
phones you get all of your data
including individual app data and login
information eight spotlight search with
a simple swipe down from the home screen
you access spotlight search which lets
you search for anything whether it's an
app on your phone and app on the App
Store that you want to download a
location in maps or even websites that
match your search all in one convenient
place 9 iMessage iMessage not only lets
you send messages securely with
end-to-end encryption but it also has
fun little features like expressive
messages and an emoji along with more
useful features like being able to send
messages across all of your devices
reason number 10 parental controls
better parental controls with
restrictions allow you to block content
and actions through a password-protected
setting meaning you can make sure that
your kid isn't visiting any web sites
that they shouldn't be and
and have the option to prevent them from
erasing browser history so you can
monitor their activity 11 vibrates which
the physical vibrates which on the
iPhone not only makes it easy to quickly
put your phone on silent whether the
screen is on or off but it also acts as
a visual cue so you can tell if your
phone is on vibrate or not with just a
quick glance 12 longer support Apple
typically supports their phones with
software updates for much longer than
Samsung does case in points the galaxy
s4 which was released in 2013
stop receiving software updates in 2016
the iPhone 5s on the other hand also
released in 2013 is still running on the
latest version of iOS 1213 usable screen
real estate
the iPhones display gives you more
usable screen real estate than the notes
this is because the iPhone isn't
burdened with the navigation bar
allowing it to show you more content and
unlike the notes curved edges the
iPhones thin bezels don't cover the cost
of functionality or distortion when
you're doing things like watching video
14 face ID we unlock our phones over 80
times a day and with face ID those
unlocks are much more ergonomic since
you don't the stretch your finger all
the way up to reach a fingerprint
scanner and those unlocks are also more
convenient since all you have to do is
look at the phone which is especially
useful when you're authenticating in
password-protected apps reason number 15
faster performance as we saw in our foam
of style speed test the iPhone and it's
eight old Bionic chip is faster at not
only loading up applications but also at
doing tasks within those applications
like opening up a word document or
exporting a photo 16 fast OS updates on
the iPhone you can update it to the
latest version of iOS pretty much as
soon as Apple releases it whereas on the
notes
it usually takes at least a month before
Samsung is able to push out a security
fix and several months before they're
able to push out a system upgrade 17
resale value the iPhone tends to enjoy
higher resale values than the notes with
right now the iPhone 8 plus selling for
an average of five hundred and fifty
nine dollars used while the notes is
selling for only four hundred
$17 used meaning you'll get more money
back when you eventually sell the iPhone
18 better apps
generally speaking app developers seem
to prioritize iOS / Android which means
not only do apps and their respective
app updates come to the iPhone first but
sometimes particularly with games apps
never end up making their way over to
Android and stay exclusive to the iPhone
19 accessory ecosystem similar to app
developers accessory manufacturers also
prioritize for the iPhone so if you want
a suite docking station a camera lens
case or other cool accessories you're
much more likely to find it for the
iPhone than you are for the notes reason
number 20 3d touch the entire screen on
the iPhone is pressure sensitive which
means just by applying a bit more
pressure to the screen than you normally
would you can do things like previewing
links in an app without actually having
to leave the app shooting a gun in a
first-person shooter game without
needing a separate trigger button and
moving the cursor on the keyboard in any
direction without having to stretch your
fingers up to the cursor itself 21
better text input when you take 3d
touches cursor control with iOS is drag
and drop features and sprinkle in some
shake to undo inputting and editing text
becomes a lot easier to do on the iPhone
compared to the notes 22 true tone
display with true tone the iPhone
automatically adjusts the display to
look the same regardless of the
environment that you're in giving you a
more comfortable and consistent
experience 23 tap to top you can
automatically scroll to the top of any
screen by tapping on the status bar this
works system-wide in any app across the
phone and it's great for when you're
really far down an email thread or a
webpage and you want to get to the top
quickly without having to swipe down a
bunch of times 24 privacy in addition to
the little visual cues you get when an
app is using something like your
microphone because of their different
revenue models Apple has less of an
incentive to collect your personal data
which explains why in some instances
Android phones have been found to
collect almost ten times more data on
you than iPhones and finally reason
number 25
minted reality the iPhone was built with
augmented reality in mind with there
having not just the dual camera system
on the back but the true depth camera
system on the front meaning not only can
you do things like play AR games on your
coffee table or get dimensions with
virtual measuring tape but you can also
do things with third-party apps like
getting a 3d scan of your face to help
you find the perfect pair of glasses
okay so those are the top 25 reasons why
the iPhone could be considered better
than the notes but remember the word
better is subjective so be sure to watch
the Notes version of this video which
will be linked for you down below in the
description anyways that is it for me in
this video thank you guys for watching
and as always I'll see you in the very
next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
