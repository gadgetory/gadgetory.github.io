calm and in this video we're going to be
doing a review on the LG Nexus 4 by
Google well start off with a quick
hardware tour so on the top of the front
you have an earpiece and a 1.3 megapixel
front-facing camera of course you have
your large 4.7 inch IPS display and at
the very bottom of the front you have an
LED notification light for all your
notifications on the back you have a
slit speaker grill and LG logo a nice
almost matrix-like design on the back
that isn't quite showing up here of
course you have your nexus branding
being that it is a Nexus device and
finally at the top you have a 8
megapixel camera with LED flash on the
left side of the phone you have your
micro sim door and your volume rocker
for volume up and down on the right side
of the phone you have nothing but the
power button to turn the screen are the
device on and off at the top you have a
3.5 millimeter headphone jack and your
secondary microphone and finally on the
bottom you have your micro USB charging
port your primary microphone and two
little screws on each side to open up
the device alright so let's get right
into the review the first thing I want
to talk about is to build quality and
design on the nexus for my first
impressions of the phone where that it
felt like a premium device both the
front and back are covered in gorilla
glass with the back having this unique
sparkle design that shows up when light
hits it at an angle and I honestly feel
like it's a really nice touch on the
front the glass is smoother than your
average touch screen making it easy for
your fingers to glide across it I found
this to be especially useful when gaming
considering all the quick movements you
need to be able to make and because the
glass is so slippery I'm glad Google
decided to go with a soft touch rubber
material on the edges which gives you a
great grip on the phone while also
giving it a nice matte black finish when
it comes to size and weight the next is
for is on par with other top android
handsets like the previous nexus and the
galaxy s3 while technically it's heavier
and thicker than these two devices it
isn't really noticeable and if anything
it actually plays into the premium feel
of the phone speaking of premium let's
talk about the display the 4.7 inch IPS
plus display on the Nexus 4 has a
resolution of 1280 by 768 which Nets you
about 317 pixels per inch because its
width is 768 instead of the typical 720
you
you did a little bit of letterboxing
when viewing HD video but it's barely
noticeable and the extra pixels are
actually welcomed just about everything
on the screen looks sharp inaccurate so
to sum of this part of the review I had
to say that the screen is definitely one
of the best out there with a screen like
this you want to make sure the phone can
handle whatever multimedia you throw at
it and with the Adreno 320 GPU the Nexus
board does this beautifully the games we
tested ran without a hitch and kept
their high frame rates and getting in
and out of apps on the Nexus 4 was a
snappy as I've ever seen on any other
device thanks to both its software
optimizations with Android 4.2 and its
quad-core Snapdragon s4 pro processor
with to you bytes of RAM the benchmarks
tell a different story though with the
nexus 4 only scoring 4800 on quadrant
but this is most likely due to the lack
of optimization for android 4.2
especially considering that the Nexus
4's brother in the Optimus G scored over
7,000 all right onto the camera the
nexus 4 has an 8 megapixel shooter with
LED flash that takes pretty decent shots
but from my experience I wouldn't put it
on the same level as the cameras on the
galaxy s3 or the iphone 5 I mean in good
lighting conditions the pictures look
good but that's the same for just about
any high-end smartphone but in low light
especially with shaking hands the camera
on the Nexus 4 just doesn't perform as
well as some of the other top
smartphones but don't take that as me
saying the camera is bad because it
definitely isn't and if you're not
coming from another new high-end
smartphone the camera should still be an
upgrade okay so you've got a decent
camera a powerful processor and a killer
screen that combo may have you worrying
about the battery life a bit the nexus 4
has a 2100 milliamp battery under the
hood just like the galaxy s3 does and
just like with the 8 megapixel camera it
doesn't seem to perform at the same
level on average I got about seven to
eight percent less use on the Nexus
forged battery compared to the s3s but
the good news is it should still be
enough to get you throughout the day
call quality is about the same on the
Nexus 4 as it is on other high-end
Android smartphones and the speaker in
the back is loud enough to get the job
done but not quite as loud as on phones
like the galaxy s3 in the iphone 5 this
is especially true when the phone is
sitting down on a counter because the
slit style speaker grill almost gets
sealed off which drastically lowers the
volume
so far we've covered the hardware but
it's really the software that makes you
want a Nexus device with the Nexus 4 not
only are you getting the latest version
of Android you're getting Android in its
most pure form no bloatware no
third-party apps pre-installed you're
getting Android the way Google
envisioned it to be and you're pretty
much guaranteed to get updated to the
next version of android at least a
couple of months before most other
devices do you just gotta love that
overall I give the nexus for a thumbs up
while I wish I had a better performing
camera and battery and full 4g LTE
support I think that the beautiful HD
display the powerful quad-core processor
the pure Google experience and the
ridiculously low price point are more
than enough to make up for it alright
