decided to make the switch from my
google pixel XL which I switched to
about six months back to this Samsung
Galaxy s8 now I have a bunch of
different reasons on why I'm making the
switch but the gist of it is there's no
smartphone right now that comes close to
the s8 on a harder level this thing
straight up looks like it's a phone from
the future and while Samsung software is
far from perfect it has improved over
the years and comes with its own unique
set of advantages but what I want to
talk about in this video is not so much
why I switched to the Galaxy S AIDS but
why I didn't end up switching to the
Galaxy S 8 plus because I've always been
the kind of person to go with the bigger
model of a smartphone and my reasoning
has always been the same with a bigger
phone comes a bigger screen and a bigger
battery so when Samsung first announced
the galaxy s 8 and the s 8 plus I was
fully expecting the s 8 plus to win me
over but after using both phones for a
while now and going back and forth
between them for the first time ever I
think the smaller model is the better
option at least for me now before those
of you who bought the galaxy s 8 plus
dislike this video I know it's going to
happen anyway I'm not saying that the s
8 plus is a bad choice okay I thought
the IC plus was a bad choice then I
wouldn't have switched to the s 8 to
begin with and believe me when I tell
you that choosing between a 2 wasn't an
easy decision as the SI plus still has
the advantage of a bigger screen and a
bigger battery so why then like why
would I someone who's always used the
bigger phones are the bigger models of a
foam decide to give up the bigger screen
and the bigger battery for the smaller
s8 well first thing has to do with the
placement of the fingerprint scanner we
all know that Samsung messed up with
this placement and on the si plus with
it being such a cell phone it's just not
easy to read like I'm not going to be
one of those people who says it's
unreachable it's not reachable but it
isn't comfortable to reach either on the
regular s8 this would be right handed
this is really an issue now I can
already see the comments about how
Samsung offers alternative lock methods
and if you don't like the fingerprint
scanner you don't have to use it but I
don't really buy that argument ok facial
recognition is obviously insecure and
while the iris scanner is secure I don't
think it's a good option as a primary
lock method because if you're walking if
you're in direct sunlight or if you're
wearing sunglasses it isn't going to
work
well and it's always going to be a
slower two-step process the first weight
in the phone and then bringing it up to
your face that's not convenient to do
and that's not something I'd want to do
every time I wanted to access my phone I
know - some of you the fingerprint
scanner may seem like a small thing to
complain about but according to Apple's
data people unlock their phones on
average 80 times a day for me it's
easily over a hundred times a day but
even if you multiply 80 by 365 days in a
year and multiplies that over 2 or 3
years of ownership it adds up to over
50,000 plus minor inconveniences and
that's not even counting the mysteries
ok and trust me there will be miss reads
the fingerprint scanner on the s8 both
the S aids isn't the most accurate one
out there it doesn't compare with like
the pixel or the 1+3 and on the SI plus
it's even worse because sometimes you
don't reach up high enough and it only
gets a partial print the second argument
I have in favor of the s8 is unlike the
SI plus the top of the screen is easily
reachable with one hand on the s8 plus
with the new aspect ratio the opposite
corner of the screen is almost
unreachable without completely having to
adjust your grip for comparison the
regular or smaller si screen is about as
high up when you hold it in your hand as
the Google pixel excels or the iPhone 7
plus --is which for many people is
already near the limits of one-handed
use the s8 plus literally takes this to
a whole different level and unless you
plan on using Samsung's one handed mode
a lot I'd say that the s8 plus is a
two-handed phone and then my third and
final argument in favor of the smaller
galaxy s aids has to do with those air
quotes I've been using throughout this
video when I refer to the smaller s8
because while the huge display on the si
plus is amazing let's not forget the
smaller Galaxy s8 has a pretty damn big
screen itself I mean you see Samsung
fanboys laughing at iPhone users because
the smaller s8 has a bigger screen than
the seven plus but kernel people are
taking that seriously enough I mean
Samsung fits a five point eight inch
display or the surface area equivalent
of a 5.5 inch display into the width of
a 5.1 inch phone that's a big deal and I
don't think people ever bought big
phones because they just love the big
form factor I don't think people buy big
phones because they wanted something
else harder to hold in the hand
or something that took up more room in
their pocket no I think people buy big
phones because they wanted the bigger
screen and a bigger battery and while
you don't get the bigger battery in the
galaxy si let's be clear about that you
are at least getting a big screen and it
comes with all the advantages of having
a smaller overall device I watched a
movie on both homes just to test them
out and I found the experience on the
regular SH to be more enjoyable because
the difference in screen size was easily
accounted for by bringing the phone
closer to my eyes but the lighter weight
on the SI made holding the phone for an
extended period of time much less of a
strain than it was with the SI 2 plus
now don't get me wrong okay I'm not
gonna sit here and pretend that the new
aspect ratio on the SI changes
everything in certain situations like
when you're watching videos in portrait
on Instagram you're still limited to the
screens with which takes you right back
to making it feel like a traditional 5.1
inch display and in those situations I
missed a bigger screen on the sh+ also
at the end of the day when my s8 had 10%
battery remaining even though
technically enough in did the jobs I
still found myself missing the peace of
mind I had with the additional 5 or 10%
I was getting on the bigger model but
when you factor in the more convenient
fingerprint scanner the easier to reach
display a screen that is arguably big
enough and all the perks you get with a
smaller overall device and the fact that
it cost $100 plus I think this year the
smaller s ace has the edge but - is my
opinion ok it's just an opinion what do
you guys think which one / the SI did
you end up going with and why let me
know down below in the comments anyways
that is it for me in this video thank
you guys for watching and as always I'll
see you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
