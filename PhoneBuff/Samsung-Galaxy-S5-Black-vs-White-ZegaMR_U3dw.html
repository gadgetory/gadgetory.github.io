don't usually do comparisons between the
different colors of the same foam but I
happen to have both the black and the
white versions of the galaxy s5 in the
studio and after spending some quality
time with will probably end up being the
two most popular color choices I found
that there actually are some things to
consider between the two that go beyond
just the obvious color difference so the
first thing we'll take a look at are the
faces of each phone now besides the fact
that one is white and the other is black
the thing that immediately jumped out on
me when looking to these two phones side
by side were those two black dots on the
white version otherwise known as sensors
that are just kind of asking for your
attention whereas on the black version
those same sensors blend into the point
where they're barely noticeable the
earpiece on the white s5 is chrome which
nicely matches the side bands of the
phone whereas on the black s5 the
earpiece is blacked out just like it's
bezels giving it a much more subtle look
up top now speaking of those bezels on
the black version the black bezel is
flat black all the way through on the
white version you have a dotted pattern
going on which is similar to what we saw
last year on the Galaxy s4 at the bottom
of the s5 I found out the capacitive
buttons on the black version are easier
to see in direct sunlight
due to the contrast of the white light
against the black bezels and they also
seem to bleed less light in the dark
where the white versions capacitive lens
sort of look like they're surrounded by
a white bubble which reminds me while
the black s5 doesn't have a dotted
pattern on his bezels it does have what
looks like an air bubble going all the
way around the edge of the phone I don't
know if Samsung did this for design
purposes or if it's just a waterproof
seal that shows up only on the black
version but the good news is it's only
visible under direct light going around
to the back of the phones there isn't
too much of a visual difference outside
of what Samsung calls the charcoal black
and shimmery white back covers but there
is a difference in how these back covers
actually feel the black version is more
grippy and feels closer to a leather
material whereas the white version is
had bit less grippy and feels more like
a hard plastic material now the
difference isn't necessarily huge but
there definitely is a difference and
it's kind of hard to explain in words
over videos
so I think it's best demonstrated by the
sounds that each make when being
scratched if you're wondering why Samson
would make the white versions battery
door feel different from the black
versions it was most likely to help the
white version be more resistant to
staining which the black version
naturally doesn't have to worry about as
much and so far it looks like what they
did is working as my white Galaxy s5 has
no marks or stains but then again I've
only had it for a few weeks so we'll
have to wait and see how it fares over
time but besides that that's pretty much
it for the differences between the white
and the black versions of the Galaxy s5
and everything else looks identical from
what I can tell now personally I'm
leaning towards the black version just
because I like that clean and subtle
look in the front but I do have to say
that I like the way that the back cover
looks on the white version so I'm a just
a rocking it stormtrooper style with the
white back cover on the black version
but let me know what you guys think what
version do you plan on picking up or do
you even plan on picking one up at all
