have heard about VPNs before there are
several reasons why schools and
businesses use them around the world but
in today's video we're going to be
looking at why a regular person like you
and me would want a VPN installed on our
phones and personal computers so first
things first what the heck is a VPN well
not to get too complicated here
basically a VPN or virtual private
network allows you to access the
Internet in a way that is private secure
and anonymous VPNs create what's called
a secure tunnel between your device and
the server you're connecting to and they
encrypt all that data you send to the
server and receive back from the server
to keep any prying eyes from being able
to see it but the how here isn't as
important as the why so why should you
use a VPN of your smartphone well I'm
going to give you three reasons the
first we kind of already talked about
which is privacy and anonymity when you
connect to the internet you usually do
so using your ISP or Internet service
provider who can see what you're doing
online in what websites you're visiting
this may not be an issue for you as you
probably aren't doing anything illegal
or embarrassing but still knowing that
someone could be watching you do
something as normal as having a
conversation can be creepy
okay like a cut yeah we're when you use
a VPN all your data is encrypted so your
ISP can't actually see what you're doing
online and all they really see is that
you're connected to a VPN on top of that
the websites you visit online don't see
your actual IP address which can be
tracked to your physical location and
instead the websites only see the VPNs
IP address as all your data is
technically being rerouted through that
encrypted connection so again it's more
private and anonymous the second reason
you should have a VPN installed on your
phone is security especially if you use
public Wi-Fi hotspots like at a local
coffee shop which often have unsecure
connections that can be easily hacked by
using a VPN while on those Wi-Fi
connections all your data is encrypted
so the only thing a hacker or
eavesdropper can see is a bunch of
scrambled up encrypted data that doesn't
make any sense finally the third reason
a VPN can be handy is we are trying to
access content that is blocked or
otherwise unavailable in your home
country by using a VPN you can reroute
your connection through another country
essentially tricking websites into
thinking that you're visiting them from
the country you're rerouting to so it's
kind of like you're teleporting
digitally so let's say you're in the US
and you want to view content that is
only available to people in Germany
normally you're Sol but with a VPN you
can set your region to Germany and
access that content just like somebody
who actually lives in Germany which is
pretty cool so those are the three main
reasons why you should be using a VPN on
your phone but there can be a few
potential downsides to using a VPN the
first is because the data you're sending
across the Internet is being encrypted
and then decrypted back and forth in
that secure tunnel it's home school
Brown boo boo but that issue isn't as
big of a deal if you're using a VPN with
really fast servers or if you simply
turn the VPN off when you have a need
for speed the second issue is some VPNs
either charge you upfront to use their
servers or they charge you after you use
up a certain amount of data but again
this issue can be solved if you find a
VPN service that is free and on
which brings me to the sponsor for
today's video and opera VPN so opera has
their new iPhone and desktop apps
available for free with unlimited views
on their super fast servers and in
addition to offering all the benefits
that VPNs bring to the table their app
also have the option to block ads and
stop online trackers from following you
around the web just download the Opera
VPN app from the App Store open it up on
your iPhone hit install profile and
allow it to add the VPN to your settings
after that it's as simple as hopping
into the Opera app settings and flipping
the VPN switch to the on position super
easy and once you do it you'll see a VPN
icon in the notification bar letting you
know that anything you access on the
internets whether that's Facebook or
using the browser is now private and
secure our VPN is also available for
Android as well as being built right
into the new opera 40 browser for
computers I'll be putting all the links
you need down below in the description
so check them out but anyways that is it
for me in this video thank you guys for
watching and as always I'll see you in
the very next episode
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
