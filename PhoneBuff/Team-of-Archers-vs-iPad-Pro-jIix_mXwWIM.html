great amount of professionals if you
were able to acquire as many as we did
good for you but still do not stamp this
at home okay I I feel like a fool but I
feel really cool what's your thing
I hear that's that horsehair that's
pubic hair dude am I doing this right
what's up guys david and jay here
welcome back to yet another episode of
vs. the show where we work with
professionals to do extreme durability
tests we got the members of the Long
Beach State archery club and along with
Jay myself we've got a few pointers
we're not necessarily pros well we got
plenty of pros and back us up
so let's see what happens when we go
against the iPad pro I'm nervous about
this one
that's so far that plus resort my ball
is hanging out with a bunch of freshness
a321 and when I see one with a fire and
we all shoot it okay I can't do that
flippy thing like you do okay I wanna we
basically we go on fire guys all right
so three two one fire I'm nervous man
I'm nervous all right okay so I guess
everybody like get ready ready
all right so
three two one okay so uh see what
happened I think my arrow fell on the
floor no I hit the target still at least
first first let's see if this is my
arrow obviously this is my girl wait is
it is it oh did you beat someone okay so
anyway one two three four five six seven
eight eight arrows went through four
arrows missed one arrow hit the floor
this is j0 guys here so we got to zero
where's my arrow where is my arrow damn
damn damn whose is this one that one
went all the way in yeah that one's mine
too we shot it together we're friends is
your god damn it this is mine I was
hoping i okay alright so we're here at
the slow-motion booth let's see what the
hell happened somebody shot earlier I
know I got three oh yeah I was like
three and somebody shot a man shoot at
the same time somebody shot super-late I
don't know who that was I know who was
it who was it
alright so taking a look at the slow-mo
the first arrows set the tone for the
carnage to come cracking the screen upon
impact the second arrow added insult to
injury with this ripple effect that
maybe iPad screen looked like water as
opposed to glass soon after that the
other arrows started to fly in with that
fifth arrow hitting the screen but
failing to penetrate falling off
glorious Lee in slow motion you can see
my arrow missed there and while GG's
arrow did in fact hit the target it was
so off that it didn't even make the cut
last but not least the final two arrows
take the cake with the second-to-last
arrow impaling the iPad for
than everyone else's and then if you
noticed earlier one of the archers took
a bit longer to shoot but that extra
couple of seconds led to a near perfect
bullseye to finish off the iPad
all right so Jane I've decided we're
gonna do another test but before we do
the other test we have to see what the
first test did so we're gonna go ahead
and pull this arrow out so I can get in
here okay let's let's not break it in
half when we when we pull it off though
oh you like crunching oh wait slow slow
there you go
oh wow oh all right
so go oh that is pretty freakin awesome
that looks legit oh my god I want to
pull this Apple logo off if I can no no
I can't you can I suppose just pull
these guys out oh here you go arrow one
two oh god okay
well nope
yeah hey put it down bro sorry I should
really stop it so there you go that's
good I don't think we could run this
test again to be honest so as we were
trying to pull out the arrows the pin
caught on fire let's take a look at the
back right here so it didn't catch fire
when we shot it but it caught fire when
we tried to move the arrow out it's
almost like a cup like a like a bullet
you know like I went it's in there holds
the blood and we pull it out also the
blood gushes out that is called
electronic blood the question is whose
arrow was that that caused the fire is
there a name on this one no there's no
name on this one
Oh m'kay who's NK okay Wow look in the
call the cool aiming right for the
battery this well they make sure you
unleash the wrath alright guys well I
guess this test got run short but that
is it for us in this video hope you guys
