ready to the speed test between the
Galaxy Note 8 and the iPhone 8 plus and
you know while that test answered some
of our questions it did leave us with
others like how does the note 8 compete
with the 1 plus 5 which is the current
bump of style speed dash champ or how is
it compete with a Galaxy s8 which you
know outside of the RAM difference has
pretty much the same specs or at least
the ones that affect performance so
today we're gonna be doing a 3-way speed
test to help answer those questions but
before we get into it I want to thank
story box for sponsoring today's episode
so story blocks has the largest
unlimited download library of graphics
photos vectors and images on the
internet with over 400,000 plus to
choose from now most websites charge you
per graphic with it costing anywhere up
to $30 per image so as you can imagine
things can get really expensive really
quickly when you're designing a website
you're running a blog or a YouTube
channel or making art projects that you
might want to sell but with story blocks
you get unlimited downloads for just one
small annual fee I'll be using story
blocks to help me make my videos better
for years now so it's definitely
something I'd recommend checking out and
the best part is they're actually given
the phone buff audience a free 7 day
trial to this unlimited membership so go
to story box comm slash YouTube or click
on that link down below in the
description to start downloading and get
started today
alright let's get to the speed test okay
so you guys know the drill we'll kick
things off by starting the stopwatches
on each phone and then jump right into
the first row of system apps where the
note 8 gets the step over the 1 plus 5
with the Galaxy S AIDS falling
immediately behind as the si+ joins the
other two in the second row the 1 plus 5
is able to close that gap between it and
the no 8 in snapchat with all three
phones now working on Photoshop mix so
with the note 8 + 1 + 5 now neck and
neck it'll be interesting to see if
either one of them can create some
separation here in lapses and from the
looks of it the node 8 finishes laughs
it have a slightly faster rate putting
it ahead once again here in the speed
test but we still have plenty of apps
left to go in this first lap so this is
still anybody's race with a note 8
finishing subway surfers at a faster
rate allowing it to increase its lead
over the 1 plus 5 if only by a half step
all three phones work on loading flip
diving where the note 8 once again
finishes first with its sights set on
the dethroning the 1 plus 5 as the
book style speed test champ of course
that task is easier said than done with
almost 5 flexing it's higher clock
processor wiping out any advantage that
no aids had as both mounds move on to
bullet force with the SI plus finally
joining them where while it has fallen a
bit behind it's still not technically
out of the running
all right so the note 8 and the Wampus 5
move on to the last row where the 1 plus
5 actually takes the lead blazing
through Spotify and just bursting
through ESPN so a late lead change here
in the first stop let's see if the node
age can recover and uh no it loads a
Netflix up at a slower rate allowing the
one plus five to finish lap one first
with a time of 1 minute and 24 seconds
with a node 8 coming in a full 7 seconds
later with a time of 1 minute and 30 ok
so both the node 8 and the 1 plus 5 are
expected to keep all the apps open with
the node 8 having a whopping 6 gigabytes
of RAM while the 1 plus 5 has an almost
ridiculous 8 gigabytes ram and so far
both bones haven't had any trouble at
all with one plus 5 running away with it
thanks to its faster animations and more
responsive home button finishing the
test with the time of 1 minute and 48
seconds with the Galaxy Note 8 having
only just a few more apps left to go but
I think the more interesting story here
is how the no dates beat the galaxy si
plus in the first lap because outside of
the RAM difference which is clearly
being demonstrated here with the si plus
failing to keep subway surfers open the
note 8 and si plus have basically
identical processors and storage so the
difference between them is most likely
due to the no dates more updated
software so it'll be interesting to see
if the si plus gets any faster once
samsung updates it but for now the
results are what they are with the
winner and still bumble of style speed
test champ being the 1 plus 5 ok so here
the individual app load of times from
the first lap where you can see exactly
where the 1 plus 5 was able to beat out
the note aides
most likely thanks to its higher clocked
processor anyways that is it for me in
this video thank you guys for watching
and as always I'll see you in the very
next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
