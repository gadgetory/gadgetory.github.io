robots so war robots is the tactical PvP
multiplayer game that you want to be
playing right now we're talking six feet
six with over fifty million people
having already downloaded the game you
get to pilot your own combat robots gear
it up with hundreds of different
possible weapon combinations and crush
your opponents in battles the graphics
in the game are awesome there's a bunch
of robots maps and locations and the
game is available for free on both iOS
and Android so click on my link down
below in the description to get a
hundred gold and 100,000 silver and
in-game currency but on to the speed
test today we're pitting the 1+5 against
arguably the most popular Android phone
right now in the galaxy x8 these phones
share some similarities on the spec
sheet with both of them being powered by
the Snapdragon 835 in both using ufs 2.1
storage of course there are some
differences with the wall post having
double the RAM at eight gigabytes so
it'll be interesting to see not only
which one is faster but how big of a
difference there is between the two
especially on that first lap since on
paper they should perform roughly the
same so with that said let's go ahead
and get right into it ok so you know the
drill will kick things off by starting
the stopwatches on each phone and then
jump right into the first row of system
apps where after taking that selfie
faster than the Galaxy s8 the one post
takes the lead already moving on to the
second row now while the 1+5 animations
are faster than the animations on the
Galaxy s8 the difference isn't anywhere
near as big as it is compared to the
iPhone 7 plus so the s8 is still right
there behind it with the oneplus 5 only
managing to put itself a half app ahead
so far however even though both phones
are using the same snapdragon 835 look
at the oneplus process that time-lapse
at a faster rate adding on to its lead
as both phones start working on subway
surfers now it'll be interesting to see
if the oneplus 5 can run away with it
here in the gaming row as oneplus says
that they have the phone ramped up its
processor when loading heavy duty game
so in theory it should outperform the
si+ even though they both use the
Snapdragon 835 and even though they both
have ufs 2.1 storage and so far that
seems to be the case the oneplus 5
already moves
two bullet bores with it loading subway
surfers flip diving and fits a phat at a
faster rate allowing it to add onto its
lead as both phones are now working on
the last game here in the third row
where once again is the one four five
finishes first as it moves on to the
last row here in the first lap with it
just blowing through Spotify and ESPN
putting it a full two apps ahead of the
galaxy s 8 which finally finishes with
bullet fours and joins the 1 plus in the
last row but it wasn't for long as the 1
/ 5 finishes the first op with the time
of 1 minute and 27 seconds and begins
working on the second lap where it's
whopping 8 - pika bytes of RAM allows it
to easily keep all the apps open and
ready to go in the background creating
an almost insurmountable lead over the
SAS which finishes that first lap 16
seconds later at the time of 1 minute
and 43 seconds and just barely escapes
the embarrassment of being lapped by the
1 + 5 which completes the whole test
only 8 seconds later with the time of 1
minute and 51 seconds so we'll go ahead
and fast-forward the Galaxy s8 to the
finish line
where unfortunately the s8 failed to
keep most of the apps open in the
background it had to reload all the
games along with Photoshop snapchat and
Facebook which pushed it even further
behind with a finally completing the
speed test with a total time of 3
minutes and 4 seconds making the winner
and still fumble style speed test camp
the 1 + 5
here are the individual app load of
times where you can see exactly where
the 1 + 5 ran away with it in the first
lap and of course the second lap was no
contest with the 1.5 having double the
RAM anyways that is it for me in this
video thank you guys for watching and as
always I'll see you in the very next
