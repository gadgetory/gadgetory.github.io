I'm reviewing the Samsung Focus s
available from 18t so let's start off
and do a quick hardware tour on the
front you have a beautiful Super AMOLED
plus display which is 4.3 inches going
diagonally and has 800 by 480 resolution
on the top left you have your front
facing camera which is 1.3 megapixels
and your earpiece on the bottom of
course you have your standard capacitive
touch buttons for Windows Phone which is
back home and search on the very top you
have your 3.5 mm and a headset jack on
the right side you have your power key
and your dedicated camera key on the
bottom we have your micro USB charging
port and microphone and on the left you
have nothing but your volume rocker for
volume up and down of course on the back
you have your 8 megapixel camera with
LED flash capable of 720p video
recording and at the very bottom you
have your speaker grill so that's a
quick overview of the hardware let's go
ahead and dive right into the review
alright so the focus is obviously
running the Windows Phone operating
system version 7.5 mango go ahead and
show you the About section of the phone
so you can see it's running Windows
seven point five it has 16 gigabytes of
on-board storage of course says 14
gigabytes because 2 bits being used up
it's running on AT&amp;amp;T because it's
exclusive to AT&amp;amp;T and I'll go ahead and
run a benchmark while I give you some of
the other specs so we'll run WV bench
I'll go to speed and hit start test
alright so underneath the hood you have
a 1.4 gigahertz Qualcomm MSM 8255
processor with 512 megabytes of RAM so
it is a single core processor but of
course all windows phones are singing of
course so it's definitely on the high
end slowly a few processor out there
that are clocked higher like the one on
the HTC Titan at 1.5 gigahertz versus
1.4 of course is only a hundred
megahertz so it's not gonna make that
big of a difference and I'll go ahead
and skip to the results for this
benchmark and let you the scores alright
so the test is complete and the phone
scored a ninety six point twenty
six so pretty good score I'd say the
performance I get is just about the same
um I get really good performance on here
everything is buttery smooth and
applications open up pretty much as soon
as I tap on them I mean one of the best
performances I've are one of the best
performing devices I've seen on Windows
Phone I'll go ahead and run the browser
mark benchmark so we can see how fast
the browser is and again I'll just skip
to the results so you guys could see
what the score is all right so the
browser mark benchmark is done it scored
a 30 1102 so of course when this one
doesn't score as high as some of the two
core Android phones out or the iPhone 4s
but what performance has been pretty
good for me you know I don't necessarily
notice it lagging compared to some of my
Android phones so I'm pretty happy with
the performance of device but it's
pretty much all I want to talk about
performance because I really want to get
into what I love about this phone and
that's the design the phone is really
really lightweight it's only three point
nine ounces and it's only eight point
five millimeters thin or thick so
definitely want to finish Windows Phones
out there and one of the lightest feels
really good in the hand it reminds you
of my galaxy s the original one for
Android as far as the the feel in the
hand even though this is a 4.3 inch
screen and that one is a 4 inch screen
it pretty much is the same size so you
know you kind of get it you're getting
more screen size in the same form factor
so definitely happy with the design of
this phone the build quality is pretty
good of course it is that you know
plastic you feel that you get with most
Samsung phones but that's what makes the
phone lighter and I definitely feel a
lot more comfortable dropping this guy
on accident compared to the phone like
the HTC Titan because I feel like that
one would take a lot more damage than
this guy would um another thing I wanna
talk about is the battery life the
battery life on this phone is pretty
good I mean it gets me through it gets
me through the day and it doesn't you
know die on me especially with Windows
Phones battery saver option it seems to
help the AMOLED screen you know with the
black backgrounds definitely takes up
less juice and I wouldn't say it's the
best battery out there
I think the Italian might have a little
bit better battery life but I'm pretty
happy with this guy
and I think it'll get the job done
alright so the next thing I want to talk
about is the camera on a device it is an
8 megapixel camera like I said earlier
however I am a little bit underwhelmed
by it especially with the you know how
well the the phone looks and how nice
the screen is I really expected a little
bit more from the camera um it just
doesn't perform the way I described it
to you especially considering that
Samsung made it the galaxy s2 I feel
like has a lot better camera than this
guy and even the HTC Titan I feel like
has a better performing camera however
this does perform a little bit better
than the Nokia Lumia 800 from what I've
seen and let me go ahead and show you a
few pictures of the camera to kind of
give you a better idea so I took a
picture of some kandorians in a dark
environment using the LED flash and you
can see that picture quality isn't bad
here however I do feel like with a
little bit better image quality you'll
be able to see the ripples a little bit
better in the Tangerines this next
picture though is the one I'm you know
it's what I was seeing a little bit more
of that was kind of disappointed with
the hundred dollar bill here it's a
little bit blurry right here I'm of it's
coming through on camera but I have more
pictures up on film buff calm they could
actually you know click on and zoom in
on to kind of get a better idea of how
well the camera is but overall I let's
say I'm not necessarily impressed with
the camera but then again I'm not
disappointed either so you know take
that for what it's worth overall though
with the phone I'm happy with the it's
one of my favorite Windows Phones if not
the my favorite windows because it's
very thin which you don't see a lot of
them when it's fine I feel like windows
phones are a little bit thicker and the
screen on here is beautiful with its the
4.3 inch Super AMOLED screen the colors
really pop on here the blacks are very
black of course and another thing like
unlike the nokia lumia 800 this guy has
a front-facing camera 1.3 megapixel so
it's nice to see that samsung included
that it's a this feels like a really
high-end device feels like the galaxy s2
on android but a Windows Phone version
so that's my review for a more in-depth
look go to phonebook calm again that
link is in the description box below
alright listen from me in this video
stay tuned for more calm thanks for
watching it and don't forget to visit
