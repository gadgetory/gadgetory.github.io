excited for today's speed test for two
reasons
the first is the title of Bumble style
speed - champ is on the line if you guys
remember when we tested the 1 + 5 t
against the Galaxy S nine things ended
up in a tie so today we have a rematch
of sorts with the own u1 plus 6 having
the opportunity to reclaim one Plus this
spot as the undisputed champ but the
other reason why I'm excited about
today's video is in this video we're
introducing the biggest change to the
film of style speed test since we
invented it five years ago back in 2013
and that change is we're no longer gonna
be doing speed tests by hand and instead
we're gonna be doing it with a machine
which will not only allow our speed
tests to be more accurate than ever
which will not only allow us to do more
intensive tests than ever but maybe most
importantly of all it'll allow us to
bring you guys more speed tests than
ever so thumbs up for that anyways I'm
excited I hope you guys are excited I
hope you guys like it so let's get right
into it oh and one more thing we're
giving away a one plus six enter to win
at the link below all right we'll kick
things off just like we always do by
starting the stopwatch is on each phone
and then jumping into the first row of
system apps where the Galaxy S 9 is able
to take that selfie at a faster rates
but the 1 plus 6 was quicker and loading
the gallery evening things out as both
ones finish up with the calendar in
settings and move on to Facebook where
the 1 plus 6 is able to take the lead as
both phones move in and out of snapchat
and begin working on Snapseed which
thanks to our robot were actually able
to go deeper into with each phone
editing the selfie that ages took adding
a filter and exporting the image out to
storage where the s time plus was able
to erased the 1 plus 6 is lead lining
things up perfectly here in lapses where
it'll be interesting to see if there is
any difference between the two
considering that both phones have the
same snapdragon 845 processor and there
is with the oneplus 6 creating that
time-lapse at a faster rate putting it
ahead once again as both phones move on
to the gaming row so we'll see if the 1
+ 6 is able to add onto its lead through
these heavy-duty games but at least in
subway surfers the two load of the game
had an identical rate and in flip diving
is this
exact story the on plus six just can't
seem to give any real separation between
it and the s9 with the f9 + looking to
close the gap here and fit the fat which
it looks like it's actually loading
faster so heading into bullet force the
two phones are basically neck-and-neck
and with both phones having an abundance
of RAM for the second lap it will likely
come down to these last few apps in the
first lab where the stylus is able to
complete the comeback taking the lead
for the very first time in this speed
test but its lead with short lifts with
the one plus it's just the blazing
through ESPN passing the s9 as it starts
working on Netflix which it's able a lot
of faster as well giving the oneplus its
biggest lead as it finishes the first
stop with the time of 1 minute and 52
seconds with the s9 + coming in a full 5
seconds later with the time of 1 minute
and 57 so at this point the only hope
for the galaxy s 9 + to make another
comeback is if the 1 + 6 somehow fails
to keep one of these apps open and ready
to go in the background but considering
that the 1 + 6 has a whopping 8 2
gigabytes of RAM compared to the galaxy
s 9 6 gigabytes the odds of that
happening are pretty much slim to none
and just like expected both phones have
been able to keep all the apps running
in memory along the 1 + 6 to complete
the task with a total time of 2 minutes
and 32 seconds with the s9 + finishing 7
seconds later with a time of 2 minutes
and 39 making the winner and new pump of
style speedtest champ the 1 + 6 anyways
that is it for me in this video thank
you guys for watching and as always I'll
see you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
