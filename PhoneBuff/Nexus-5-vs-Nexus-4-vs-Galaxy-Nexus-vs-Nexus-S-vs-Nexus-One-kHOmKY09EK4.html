in this video we're gonna be doing a
speed comparison test between every
single Nexus smartphone from the Nexus
One all the way up to the Nexus 5 to see
how far both Android and today's
hardware has come let's go ahead and get
right into it so the first test will run
here is a boot up test to see just how
long each phone takes to load up its
version of the Android OS while these
guys are loading up I'll let you know
that both the Nexus One and the Nexus S
on the Left have a single cord one
gigahertz processor coupled with 512
megabytes RAM the Galaxy Nexus in the
middle has a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core
with a full gigabyte of RAM and the
Nexus 4 and five on the right half quad
cores clocked at 1.5 and 2.3 gigahertz
respectively both coupled with 2
gigabytes of RAM so as you can see the
Nexus 5 and the Nexus 4 finished at
about the same time maybe only a split
second difference following those two is
the dual-core Galaxy Nexus then of
course the Nexus S and just over 15
seconds after the Nexus 5 is the Nexus
One wrapping up the boot obsessed the
next test will run is loading up the
same exact app on each phone which in
this case is a game in Temple Run 2
which is both processor and GPU
intensive keep in mind that because the
resolutions are different the game
becomes more and more taxing as the
resolutions get higher which makes the
fact that the Nexus 5 loads up so much
quicker than even the Nexus 4 really
impressive with the visual quality
turned up to the maximum on each bone
the Nexus 5 is able to get a game up and
running for seconds faster than the
Nexus 4 three seconds after which the
Galaxy Nexus gets going and then in what
seems like forever in this day and age
but is only really 10 seconds later you
play temple run to on the single core
Nexus S and then finally eight seconds
after that or a hold 25 seconds after
the Nexus 5 the Nexus One finishes
uploading the game yeah if you're stuck
with a phone from early 2010 you lose it
about 25 seconds of your life every time
you play a temple run - alright so the
final test will do here is the browser
test where we'll be loading up the full
media Richford website now as you're
watching each of these load up keep an
eye not only on the status bar but also
in the pictures that show up behind each
story box as you'll notice the Nexus 5
and the Nexus
or both finish loading relatively
quickly just a few seconds apart the
Galaxy Nexus finishes quicker than
expected perhaps thanks to his dual-core
chip but the single cord Nexus S in the
Nexus 1 really struggle here so much so
that I'm just going to skip to when
they're done so we can test the
responsiveness on each phone which by
the way is just buttery smooth on the
Nexus 5 decent on the Galaxy Nexus and
then just gets really really bad when
you get down to the Nexus One okay that
about wraps up this video but I have to
say that it's amazing to see how far
both Android and today's Hardware app
come in just a couple of short years and
I can't wait to see what the future
holds but that's pretty much it for me
