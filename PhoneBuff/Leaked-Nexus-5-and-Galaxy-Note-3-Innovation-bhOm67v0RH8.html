and welcome back to another episode of
phonebook UAE's the show where you ask
me on Twitter and I answer and I ask you
on Facebook and you vote it's really as
simple as that this week we'll be
talking about innovations on the note 3
the mysterious Nexus 5 looking device we
saw in one of Google's videos 4k content
on 10 AP screens and vice versa and what
Android UI you guys like the most let's
go ahead and get started
miron asks what feature on the note 3
would you consider the most innovative
that's a good question
there are a bunch of things you could
consider to be innovative on the note 3
like it's inspired design with its
dished backing and paper resembling
sides the fact that Samsung was able to
fit in a larger 5.7 inch full HD screen
without making a device any bigger than
a note to the ever-evolving s-pen which
just keeps on getting more and more
features in there is a more practical
and the fact that the note 3 comes with
a whopping 3 gigabytes of RAM but out of
any of the things I just mentioned I'd
have to say that the 3 gigabytes Ram is
probably the most innovative because the
note 3 is the very first smartphone to
have that amount and I think having 3
gigabytes RAM is gonna make the
multitasking experience which is already
good on the galaxy s4 and the galaxy
note 2 just downright amazing on the
galaxy note 3
it'll also probably help the note 3 run
a lot smoother than the s4 considering
how much RAM TouchWiz actually takes up
Bernardo asks what is your opinion on
the mystery devices looks be it the
Nexus 5 or not okay so this question
from Bernardo was a response to the
picture I tweeted of the alleged Nexus 5
now seen in Google's KitKat Android
statue unveiling the mysterious phone
showed up at about 38 seconds into the
video where a Google employee was
holding it taking a picture of the
Android 4.4 mascot what makes me think
if the Nexus 5 is for one its head Nexus
on the back end clearly it wasn't a
Nexus 4 nor was it the Nexus 7 2 it
showed up in one of Google's very own
videos and three Google went on to later
pull down the video from YouTube which
to me makes it look like they
accidentally put the phone in the video
now it couldn't be a prototype but if
the Nexus 5 does come out
like the phone we saw in the video I
think I'd like it honestly I mean the
Nexus branding is suppose across
vertically in the phone just like it
isn't on the Nexus 7 judging from the
size of the thing it looks like it'll
house a five inch or so display and that
matte black look on the back cover is
something that I personally just really
like in fact that's why I customize my
Moto X here so yeah I like the way it
looks and I think it probably was the
Nexus 5 we saw in that video and I guess
we'll find out for sure in a couple of
months Miranda asks I was wondering
about 4k what I noticed the difference
between watching 4k videos on a 1080p
screen or watching 1080p videos on a 4k
screen you wouldn't really notice the
difference in watching 4k videos on a
1080p display since the content is being
down scaled to fit the screen but you
would definitely notice the difference
in watching 1080p videos on a 4k screen
since the content is being up scaled and
doesn't really take advantage of every
pixel but the main thing to remember
here is that this is only when you're
comparing 1080p content to 4k content on
that 4k display meaning regular 1080p
content shouldn't look any worse on a 4k
display than would on a 1080p display
hopefully that makes sense I asked you
via phone book coms weekly poll which
Android UI do you like the most and I
can't say I'm surprised that all that
the biggest chunk of you at 42 percent
said you liked stock Android the most
coming in at second place and just
barely edging out Samsung's TouchWiz was
HTC's Sense with 23% of the world
TouchWiz was really close though at 22%
with LG's and other manufacturer you are
sharing the remaining 10% when it comes
to you wise I usually prefer stock
Android like most of you since it is
Android the way Google intended it to be
but from time to time I do like having a
manufacturer you wire my phone since
they do add value in certain areas where
stock Android just doesn't and if I were
to choose one manufacturer UI over the
rest personally I'd go with HTC Sense
Sense 5 just runs buttery smooth which
isn't something you can say about all
manufacturer UI's and it adds a level of
customization to the phone like the HTC
one that stock Android can't really
match and I actually really like the
look of it so those are my reasons why I
like sense why do you like the UI you
voted for let me know down in the
comments below alright that's it for me
