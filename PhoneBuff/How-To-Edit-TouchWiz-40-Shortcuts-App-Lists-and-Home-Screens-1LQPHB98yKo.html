in this video i'm gonna show you how to
edit your TouchWiz 4.0 icons and
shortcuts that appear in your homescreen
and your app list so whether you have
the Samsung Galaxy s2 whether you have
the Galaxy Note which I have right here
this same process applies so for example
right now let's say I didn't want this
music player to show up on this bottom
bar and instead I want it on I want it
often just in my regular app list I
can't actually do that so you can see if
I press and hold in here nothing happens
if i press the app programs and say I
wanted to drag it back into the regular
list because it doesn't show up here I
press and hold in it it just goes
straight to my homescreen to make a
shortcut I was you can see it's still
here so I can't move anything on here
either it just lets me remove so
basically what you have to do is go to
your apps so you're looking at this app
screen press the Menu button and then
hit edit so once you hit edit it's gonna
say you need to switch to the
customizable grid view type in order to
be able to reorganize icons hit switch
and you only need to do this temporarily
because now you can see my icons won't
be listed alphabetically like they were
before so I'll just go ahead and pull
the music app off and now I freed up
that space right there and let's say I
wanted instead my files so I was press
and hold my files I could bring it down
you're gonna hit menu again once you're
done and then save
there you go see now you can see I've
edited this and of course now it's not
an alphabetical order like it was before
so you just have to press menu again go
to view type and now go back to
alphabetical grid which I had on before
of course you can go to alphabetical if
you wanted now you can see my or after
back in order the music player app shows
up where it should and the my files has
stayed the same and that's pretty much
it and of course we wanted to edit your
home screens you press menu from the
home screen hit edit and you do much of
the same thing you could remove home
screens like that hit yes and of course
you want to remove other home screens
you can do it just like that when I add
a home screen
hit the adds there plus icon and that's
pretty much it as far as editing
