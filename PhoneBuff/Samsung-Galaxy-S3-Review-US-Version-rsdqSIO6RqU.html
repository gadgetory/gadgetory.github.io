this video I'm doing my review of the
Samsung Galaxy s3 in this case I'm
actually using t-mobile variant so I'll
go ahead and do a quick hardware tour
before I get into what I like and
dislike about the phone so on the top
left you can see you have your LED
notification light of course you have
your earpiece and Samsung logo your
typical sensors right here and then your
1.9 megapixel front-facing camera
capable of shooting and 720p of course
you have your screen right here it's
four point eight inches going diagonally
it's 1280 by 720 in resolution that 720p
of course is Super AMOLED on the bottom
we have our physical home button which
we could press to bring on the screen we
have the menu button and the back button
it's a little bit different from your
typical ICS phone at the top of the
device we have our 3.5 milimeter headset
jack and of course we have our secondary
mic right here we have a little insert
right here we took it out put our
fingernail in to pull off the back on
the bottom of the phone we have our
micro USB charging port our main
microphone on the left side we have
nothing but our volume rocker for volume
up and down and on the right side we
have our power key to bring the phone in
and out of standby and of course turn it
off
on the back of device we have our LED
flash right here next to the camera or
eight megapixel camera right here and of
course our speaker grille t-mobile logo
in this case and at the bottom you have
your Galaxy s3 branding and that's
pretty much it for the outside actually
this pull off the back cover and you can
see you have your 2100 milliamp battery
this one is of course capable of NFC and
you can see right here is the Micro SIM
card slot and your micro SD card slot so
it's really nice to see that Samsung
included this you know I know
manufactures like HTC were opting out to
make the phones thinner or whatever it
is but really liked about that Simpson
included this because I love being able
to expand my memories go ahead and pop
this guy right back on and uh it's kind
of clicking a little pretty easy to take
it on and off by the way let's go ahead
and show you the version number of the
phone so already in the settings so this
guy is actually running of course Ice
Cream Sandwich
version 4.0 4 as of right now
um I'll go ahead and back out of course
you have your TouchWiz UI right here so
anyway that's pretty much it for the
overview let's go ahead and get into
what I like and dislike starting with
what I dislike force because I always
like ending on a positive note all right
so one of the first things that I
actually dislike what the galaxy s3 is
TouchWiz is UI not necessarily the
features or the value that it adds but
more or less the way looks I'm this you
know I I'm just kind of sick of I mean I
it's looked the same since the Galaxy S
and I had the original one in it looked
like this I mean as far as the settings
go it looks pretty much the same
of course the galaxy s2 looks the same I
mean I did a comparison you know right
then and there and it just looks pretty
much exactly the same so you wouldn't
think that you're on a new version when
you're in the settings which is kind of
disappointing because I feel like ICS
did a really nice job are at Google did
a really nice job with ICS to make the
settings look a lot better with that
holo theme it's a shame that Samsung's
been in opted to use that this doesn't
look as clean to me of course personal
purpose but anyway that's one of the
things it's really not that big of a
deal I mean if you don't really care but
you know I just think that there's
better looking you wise I feel like
sense actually does look a lot better
than TouchWiz does and I even like you
know ice cream sandwiches stock look
more than TouchWiz but anyway that's one
thing I dislike the next thing I dislike
is the keyboard so I'll go ahead and
open up a messaging and go to my
settings really quick actually not I
don't you already do so um whoops so
anyway I want to show you how the
keyboard worked um I just really don't
like the predictive text on here so I'm
typing a word like let's just do
whatever and you can see I spelt it
wrong so it corrects me right which is
nice which is what you want and that's
cool when it gets it but for example if
I if that's not what I wanted and go
back and you know I wanted to type in er
see how it says it gives me error
instead of just finishing the work for
ER to finish whatever
it gives me error so like I actually
have to press here and I don't know it
just gets kind of annoying it got it so
annoying to the point where actually
turned it off I don't have that problem
on my Galaxy Nexus using stock ICS or
even jellybean and I really feel like
you know this is the Samsung keyboard I
just feel like these stock keyboards a
little bit better of course there are
some advantages here and I'll go into
that really quick since I'm here if you
tap on this guy and hold it you can
actually go to your
education which you know we're used to
with Ice Cream Sandwich but you can
actually go into text mode to draw so I
could say you know I was right hi really
quick so hi
and you can see it types it out just
like it is on the Samsung Galaxy Note so
a lot of the notes features are actually
on this phone I'm go ahead and back out
of here and let's go ahead and talk
about the next thing I just like which
is the sound quality um not necessarily
sound cloudy when your phone actually
sounds really good when you're on a
phone call but I'm talking about sound
quality on the video so I don't actually
I'm not even gonna load it up on here
because I already did a 1080p video
sample if you guys watch that on the
channel I'll make a link down in
description the sound quality's picked
up a lot a lot of wind noise which you
know I've done it I've done videos in
that environment before and there's
always win in that environment and some
of the other ones don't pick it up as
much so this doesn't sound that good and
I've seen some other 1080p video samples
from other people and it sounds the same
so anyway that's what it dislike but the
good news is that's pretty much it I
mean everything else I likes let's go
ahead and talk about that because that
is my favorite part
alright so the first thing that I like
and I think you know this is something
that most of you guys can appreciate
right when you turn on the phone is the
screen I mean the screen on here is just
really really nice I know you know when
you compare it to phone like the Galaxy
Nexus and you think is the same in the
Galaxy Nexus is a four point six five
inch screen it's Super AMOLED 1280 by
720 piece pretty much the same stats
sort of resistance bigger technically
making the PPI on this guy lower so you
think the galaxy next to the screen is
better but it really isn't I've compared
to two side-by-side you can't tell the
difference in the PPI
samsung said that they made the pixels a
little bit closer to each other
because it is a pen solid display they
made it closer to kind of address that
issue so I can't really tell me you have
to really be under the microscope to be
able to tell but what I'm talking about
on screen is the size let's go ahead and
bring in my Galaxy Nexus really quick so
why I turn this guy off so you guys can
see I'm this is a four point six five
inch display but the difference here and
not only is this you know bigger than
the Galaxy Nexus
but the Galaxy Nexus actually has to use
a portion of those pixels are the screen
size for the buttons of course we have
physical buttons here so we're actually
using all four point eight inches and it
just really feels a lot bigger I mean
look at the screen size difference you
can put these guys down um you can tell
I mean the galaxy s3 screen is a lot
bigger than the galaxy
more so than the you know measurements
would tell you know four point six five
four point eight it's actually the
Galaxy Nexus actually measures at four
point five inches if you cancel out this
part right here so it's actually you
know point three inches bigger anyway
it's not just about the size um the
reason why I really like to display and
let's go ahead and show you some
pictures well you know babbling on about
this so we'll go to my gallery and uh
another thing I like is the camera so
I'll go ahead and show you some pictures
I took you know we'll take it we'll take
a look at my little nephew so anyway on
this picture I took on the phone itself
but what I really like about the screen
is it's always in 720p so on the Galaxy
Nexus you're only viewing 720p when it's
full screen on in this case it's always
taking up all 1280 pixels on this side
and 720 going this way so you're always
looking at 720p you're always getting
that 16 by 9 aspect ratio which is true
HD you know I feel like I get a true HD
experience on this guy even though the
Galaxy Nexus you know was one of the
first phones on Android I had you know
HD screen or 720p screen I feel like the
Galaxy s3 is really the first one that
really pushes it it's what it is you
guys can see this picture I mean I don't
know if it's coming through on camera
but this pictures is amazing I mean it
honestly looks like I took it off like a
SLR I mean maybe I'm exaggerating a
little but really really awesome picture
looks really really good anyway so two
feeders in one and knocked out two birds
with one stone right there I like the
camera and the screen let's go ahead and
talk about the next thing which is I
like the speed and you know it's kind of
hard not to talk about it this guy has a
1.5 gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon
processor underneath the hood and you
know the s4 processor has been shown on
benchmarks to outperform you know the
likes of the Tegra 3 and other quad
cores and that's really impressive to
see with just two cores and if obviously
Android probably isn't that optimized
for quad cores as it is for dual cores
but anyway the phone just flies I mean
everything I go to it just literally
flies I mean I can go straight back to
this application pretty much no lag at
all but it's not just a processor it's
the RAM to so we're pretty much used to
seeing just one gigabyte of RAM on
phones now we got to I mean this guy's 2
gigs of RAM
and two cores at 1.5 gigahertz real
you're gonna get an awesome awesome
experience
of course TouchWiz does a great job at
making the user experience a little bit
faster - and you compare similar stats
on phones between TouchWiz and then
maybe HTC sends and I always feel like
TouchWiz there's a little bitter little
bit of a better job with their kernels
to make it a little faster anyway like
the speed I already talked about the
camera but the Allens out the rear
camera the front-facing camera is 1.9
pet make megapixels so definitely looks
pretty good good let's go ahead and see
if I could load this front-facing camera
up really quick and uh well you guys are
just looking at the viewfinder but
anyway let's go ahead and put this in
front of it I don't know anyway uh the
quality on the front-facing camera looks
really good because it is higher in
megapixels shoots in 720p like I said
earlier in the video so do like both
cameras on here another thing that I
really really like what this one I
didn't even think I was gonna like it
that much until I started using it is
this physical button and this is
something that you know I like them the
iPhone instead of having to always press
the lock button which the iPhones up
here on this guy's on the side which I
love the layout to be on the side
instead of having the press which in a
big phone like this it's so much easier
you just gotta tap this guy and unlock I
mean it's so much better you know I keep
using it in flesh if you're left-handed
you probably really appreciate it
because you can just tap it and unlock
just like that so really really cool to
have that physical button you just press
and hold it to bring up your
multitasking option and um while I'm
here I might as well talk about this
when I first you know saw the galaxy s3
announced I I wasn't really happy about
the fact that they're using the Menu
button because you know I thought I felt
like that was old kind of like the UI
but I felt like it was something like
more old-school and you know they should
have had the multitasking button here
instead but I really gotta admit I like
having the Menu button
comparing it to my experience on the
Galaxy Nexus you know just a lot faster
and it always looks like this by the way
when you pop up so I'll open up a Google
Chrome right here and normally the
little three dots are right here when
you press menu do you see this comes up
in the middle of the screen so a lot
easier actually I think it's a lot
easier a lot faster to get to what you
want so big plus to have this menu I'm
never thought I would say that you know
before actually using the phone but I
love the home button you could double
tap it to bring up s voice which I'll
talk about in just a second but you
press
hold it to bring out your task and by
the way one thing I love about TouchWiz
I don't know I'm kind of going back and
forth while I talk about how I don't
like it's how I like it
I do like the features and one of the
features is having all these apps open
up in the background or I mean this is
not a feature of touch which so I'm
sorry that's Ice Cream Sandwich
happening like this and you can swipe
them off like that but if you want to
close them all one thing just hit remove
all we're just really really awesome cuz
on my Galaxy Nexus I have to like go
like that a whole bunch of times to
close them all out on this guy just that
touch of once and of course I could go
straight to my task manager see if they
really closed out and I'd clear out my
RAM and things like that so you guys cuz
yeah it does close out the application
for the most part but if I wanted to
clear my memory I can just tap clear
memory clears up my ram you guys can see
one point six two gigabytes available of
RAM so I have the two gigabytes one
point six is available so it's pretty
much an extra like 800 you're getting
compared to other phones really really
nice there let's see yeah another thing
I want to talk about the thinness I kind
of already mentioned it before but this
phone is really thin I mean they did a
really nice job to fit everything they
fit into the phone with a you know
external micro SD card and you know that
big battery because when I have in my
pocket it really feels like nothing's
there I mean you would think with the
phone this big it'd be kind of a problem
but you can't feel in your pocket at
least I can't
I know Locker would have held the phone
and you know I let them like use it for
like five minutes or something you know
kind of greedy with this guy but anyway
I let them use it for like five minutes
and they really say while the phones
really thin you could barely you know it
really makes up for how larger device is
because it's so thin um another thing I
want to talk about I like is actually
again a touch touch wiz thing and it's
the smart stay so I can't really
demonstrate it right now because it's
looking at the camera but and it plus I
have the displace to set to stay on for
like 10 minutes but let's say you have
this displayed is set to stay on for
just you know 30 seconds or whatever it
is to try to conserve battery life they
actually have this feature called smart
stay so what it does is if you're
looking at the screen the front-facing
camera will detect your face and if
you're looking at the screen you'll see
a little eye pop up over here like in
the notification bar and it means that
the screen will stay is staying on just
because it detects your face so if you
have a 30 second 30 second screen
timeout it'll actually you know keep the
screen on so if you're reading an
article there's no need to keep you know
tapping the screen every
you know 10 or 30 seconds to make sure
that it doesn't turn off because that I
know that gets annoying that's
definitely something that I've really
enjoyed by the way if you guys notice
this wallpaper in the background it's
actually a cool
Samsung wallpaper that you know lets me
put in as many stalks as I want and I'll
just randomly flash the stalks they also
have one for a news I'm going to show
you the wallpaper since I'm talking
about it and so you guys can see here's
the news wallpaper the stock wall here
there's a few other ones like of course
phase beam is old but windy weather
right here and deep sea which is pretty
nice I'm not gonna really enable those
but this wanted to give you guys a quick
look at it anyway I mean that's pretty
much all I want to talk about I mean I
don't know I mean there's so many things
I I alter I can honestly talk all day
about the galaxy s3 but obviously if you
guys could tell from the reviews so far
I'm really happy with it
I might load a custom ROM on here with
that to get custom software but I do
like TouchWiz I do like that value-added
features that they have I just don't
like the way it looks but other than
that I mean that galaxy s3 is just an
awesome awesome phone I've really
enjoyed my time with it and I really
recommend it but anyway that's it for me
and this review
hopefully I cover everything if we have
so many questions just drop them down in
the comments and I'll try to answer as
soon as I can but anyway that's it for
