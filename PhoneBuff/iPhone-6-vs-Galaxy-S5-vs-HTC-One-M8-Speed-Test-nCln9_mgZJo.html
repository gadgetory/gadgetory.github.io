we're gonna be doing a speed test that a
lot of you have been eagerly waiting for
between the all-new iPhone 6 the galaxy
is 5 and the reigning speed test champ
in the HTC One m8 so we're gonna be
doing this beat test like we do all our
other speed test and that's foam box
style where we raise each phone through
a virtual obstacle course to see which
one finishes first but before we get
into it if you happen to be one of the
millions of people who plan on picking
up the new iPhone 6 and that's partly
why you're watching this video I have a
great way for you to make some extra
cash you can get up to $400 when you
sell your old device on ebay that's for
the $200 more than you can get at other
places and what's even better ebay is so
confident that your phone will sell that
for a limited time only they'll actually
give you a hunger coupon if it doesn't
so take advantage of this awesome deal
by clicking on the first link down below
in the description go to ebay for the
wind calm and see how much your phone is
worth alright let's get right into it
alright as always all phones are coming
off a fresh reboot and are connected to
the same Wi-Fi network well begin the
speed test by starting the stopwatch on
all three phones and then head into the
camera app where they all do a
relatively good job at snapping a pic
going through the gallery app it seems
like the HTC One m8 is just a step ahead
with it already in the browser loading
up the mobile ATT site but hotter the
Steel's are both the iPhone 6 and galaxy
s5 where the iPhone 6 has actually
caught up and taken the lead finishing
the full ATT site and moving on to the
dictionary app with the galaxy s5
struggling on that browser test and
falling behind the other two all three
phones are now about an app apart from
one another with the iPhone 6 in the
lead loading up Temple Run 2
DMA in second getting into Google Earth
and the galaxy s5 in labs finishing up
Photoshop Touch but it's still very
early in this speed test so there's
still plenty of time for either the HTC
One m8 or these teams on galaxy s5 to
make a comeback but it looks like they
won't be able to do it in this lap as
the iPhone 6 is just blazing through
FIFA 14 and moving on to smash hit so if
either the galaxy s5 or the MA
or to make a comeback it'll have to be
during the second lap of this test we'll
be going through the same exact course
getting each app back to the last screen
we left it on in the first lab which
will really test the multitasking
abilities of all three phones but to get
to the second lap you have to finish the
first which the iPhone 6 just did with a
time of 1 minute in 17 seconds the MA
finishes just 7 seconds later with a
time of 1 minute and 24 seconds and the
Galaxy s5 is still stuck in that first
lap working on Angry Birds the m8 is
looking to take advantage of its quick
animation times an extra ram closing the
gap between it in the iPhone 6 and
actually catching up heading into
Photoshop Touch only to lose it once
again having to reload the app whereas
the iPhone 6 had it paused and ready to
go in the background which pretty much
puts an end to this test as far as the
winner is concerned with the iPhone 6
finishing the speed test with a total
time of 1 minute and 55 seconds so in
case you missed it following all that
action the galaxy s5 officially finished
the first lap with a time of 1 minute
and 37 seconds which is 13 seconds
slower than the HTC One m8 and a
whopping 20 seconds slower than the
iPhone 6 the m8 official time for this
race is 2 minutes and 9 seconds and well
the galaxy s5 had to reload every single
app in this second lap so I'm just gonna
fast-forward it here where you can see
it finished just under three minutes at
2:58 so there you have it the iPhone 6
is the new speed champ with at the
throne HTC One m8 still being one hell
of a fast bone and the galaxy s5 being
fast enough to get the job done but I
would no longer consider to be one of
the fastest phones on the market of
course there's a lot more to consider in
a phone than just performance just like
there's a lot more to consider in a car
than a zero to 60 time but it's still
something that's fun to test and
something that's still worth considering
anyways that's it for me in this video
if you liked it please give it a big
thumbs up and show you love and as
always thank you for watching it I'll
see you guys in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
