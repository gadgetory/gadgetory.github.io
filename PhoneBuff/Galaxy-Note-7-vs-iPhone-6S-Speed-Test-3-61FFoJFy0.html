success has had itself quite a year when
it comes to speed tests it started off
by beating the then speed test champ in
the galaxy note5
and then went on to beat a nexus 6p the
lumia 950xl
the snapdragon bearing of the galaxy s7
the Exynos variant of the galaxy s7
which beat a HTC 10 and LG g5 and then
most recently it defended its title
against the 1+3 and today it has come
full circle going up against these
successor to the phone that it started
off against in the galaxy note 7 take a
look at the spec sheet the note 7 is
packin the Snapdragon 820 processor with
4 gigabytes of RAM while the iPhone 6s
has apples dual core a nine chip to go
along with 2 gigabytes of RAM well the
note 7 take back the speed test title
that you know 5 lost or the iPhone 6s
pull off what has never been done here
at bomba and go undefeated in its
lifecycle on your mark get set go
alright so both phones jump right into
the first row of system apps taking a
selfie as they make their way on to the
gaming row with you note 7 having a
split second lead over the iPhone
success as each phone works on loading
up asphalt 8 but as we using the iPhone
dude time and again that split second
lead has been obliterated with the
iPhone 6s passing the note 7 and asphalt
8 and already finishing up with Angry
Birds so early in the speed test the
iPhone 6s has already built itself a
nice little cushion now being more than
a full app ahead of the Galaxy Note 7
and it doesn't look like it's going to
slow down at all with the iPhone just
ripping through Photoshop mix and
getting ready to work on laps it where
each one will have to create a
time-lapse from the same exact video
file so bad news for the note 7 is not
only is it digging itself further in a
hole as it struggles on Photoshop mix
but the iPhones dual core a 9 chip has
proven to be faster than the 820 in laps
it so the iPhone continues to add onto
its lead as it is just about done
working on lapses and looks to move on
to yes
all right so as you note seven finally
starts working on lab sit the iPhone
begins working on Netflix so only a few
more apps are left in this first lap for
the iPhone and then it has built itself
a huge lead over the note seven probably
one of the biggest leads I've ever seen
on a speed test here at bomba and I
don't know if the iPhone is done adding
on to it with it finishing the first lap
with a time of 1 minute and 21 seconds
while the note 7 is still working on
laps it so we may just end up seeing the
impossible here with the iPhone having a
shot at laughingly note 7 all it has to
do is keep enough apps open in the
background and so far has had every
single app ready to go so the iPhone is
closing in with it having both Photoshop
mixed and lapse it open as it does ESPN
and it's Lapsley note 7 passing it in
Netflix and finishing the second lap
with a bang with a total time of 1
minute and 51 seconds so a complete
blowout by the iPhone success we'll go
ahead and fast-forward the note 7 where
it's a 13 seconds longer to finish the
first lap then it took the iPhone to
finish both laps
the notes total time came in almost a
full minute later at 2 minutes and 49
seconds so disappointing results for the
note 7 amazing performance by the iPhone
success making it the winner and still
fumble style speed test champ thank you
guys for watching and as always I'll see
you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
