bluff calm and in this video I'm going
to show you how to enable guided access
on your iPhone or iPad you do need to
have iOS 6 or later installed in your
device for this to work but the first
I'm going to take is go over to your
settings options and then from settings
scroll down to where it says general and
tap on that and then from the general
tab scroll down to the very bottom to
where it says accessibility go ahead and
tap on accessibility and then about
halfway down from the accessibility tab
you'll see an option for learning and
guided access go ahead and tap on guided
access and you can see mine is set to
OFF which means it's disabled obviously
to enable it all we have to do is switch
the off switch to on we get two options
right over here one is to set a passcode
which I'll do in a second and the second
is to enable screen sleep which I'm
going to leave all for now because it
does enable the power button up top and
also makes the screen time out so I am
going to enable a passcode like I said
and I definitely recommend making a
passcode that's easy for you to remember
because you don't want to end up
forgetting it once enabled got it I
suppose you're going to be end up you
know getting stuck in a certain
application which definitely cause
headaches down the line but first I'm
gonna show you know why this is actually
practical for example I give my phone to
my nephew a whole bunch to play with
like games or whatnot and let's say for
example he opens up this game if I were
just give it to him without enabling
guided access what happens is he'll be
able to press home get into my phone get
into my mail get into my message and do
all the things that kids do and you know
I definitely don't want that to happen
so the way I could protect myself is
when I have the app that he wants to
play on open I get this triple click the
home button so triple click and you have
to do it really fast because if you do
it slow it'll just go back to the home
screen and you get a few options here on
the top right we get an option to start
top left as cancel the bottom left is
option so I'm just going to go ahead and
hit start and show you how it works so
I'm gonna go ahead and hit run again you
see I have full access to the app you
know I can play the game as you know you
normally would so it's not going to
limit the functionality of the app
itself but what it does limit is the
ability to do
other things for example let's say my
nephew is playing and he wanted to go
home so he would press the home button
and you can see it doesn't work so he
could press it doesn't work and it's not
just that he could actually even you
know try to press the volume buttons
nothing is working even the power button
up top won't work unless you of course
you enable that screen off option that I
talked about earlier but nothing works
so you're thinking you know how am I
going to get out of this well same way
you got in you're going to triple click
the home button and you're going to get
an option to put in your password so I'm
just going to go ahead and enter it in
really quick that's why I said it's
important to make one you remember you
get the same options again up top but
this time is to resume to end and of
course we have options in this case I
may end and you can see says guided
access ended now when I press home I
could actually get out of it which
basically restores my normal phone
functioning but it's a great thing you
know to have when you're giving your
phone to kids or just give me your phone
to somebody you know you don't want them
kind of pulling a prank on you going on
your Facebook but anyways that's pretty
much it for me in this video if you
