film buff calm and today I'll be
reviewing the Samsung Galaxy s2 in this
case it's Sprint's Epic 4G Touch variant
so I want to give you a quick hardware
toilet voice you have a four point five
inch display going diagonally and it's a
Super AMOLED plus screen with 800 by 480
resolution so the colors just really pop
on this screen the blacks are really
black and overall I just love the way
the screen looks I'm really impressed
with it
however I do wish that the resolution
was a little bit higher especially with
other devices out there with qHD
resolution or even 720p resolution but
then again you can't really complain
much because some of those other devices
don't have Super AMOLED plus they either
just have Super AMOLED or super LCD so
that's all talking about the screen for
now let's look at the rest of device
yeah the four capacitive buttons at the
bottom for menu home back and search on
the top of the device you have a two
megapixel camera
get your earpiece and the other sensors
on the right side you have nothing but
the power key to shut the screen on and
off or turn the device on and off on the
left side you have nothing but the
volume rocker on the bottom you have
your standard micro USB charging port
and your microphone on the top you have
nothing about your 3.5 milimeter headset
jack and of course on the back you have
this 1080p video camcorder with a a
micro camera LED flash got your Galaxy
has two branding right here Sprint logo
and on the very bottom you have your
speaker grille so that's just about it
on the outside of the device on the
inside of this guy it's running a 1.2
gigahertz akeno's processor coupled with
one gigabyte of ram so this is
definitely one of the fastest devices
out there so while Samsung definitely
has the hardware side of things down
with the galaxy s2 the question is does
the software match the incredible
hardware and thankfully the answer to
that question is yes because not only
does Samsung have this phone running on
Android 2.3.6 it has its TouchWiz 4.0
running over top of it now normally I'm
not
big fan of Android overlays I usually
feel like they're you know slowing down
the phone and they add unnecessary
bloatware but that's not the case with
TouchWiz I feel like TouchWiz gives me a
lot of value it doesn't slow the phone
down at all so I'm going to show you
what I mean
I have widgets running have a live
wallpaper and as you can see there's
this no lag go to my apps no lag at all
go ahead and open up the web browser so
you can see house buttery smooth they
zoom in and out I may have and I feel a
lot comm loaded there's a lot of Flash
content going on on this site and you
can see the scrolling is really smooth
the zooming is really smooth and this is
a really great experience especially
with that 4.5 inch display so go ahead
and as it are that I'm speaking of
performance go ahead and run a quadrant
benchmark sure a lot of you guys want to
see how well does vice perform so
remember it has a 1.2 gear high quino's
processor on this variant other galaxies
as twos may have a 1.5 bigger Qualcomm
Snapdragon processor so it depends on
your phone you're going to get about the
same performance I'd say because this
one's at one point to the echos the 1.5
with the Snapdragon pretty much performs
equal to the 1.2 thank you know so
there's not a major difference as far as
performance goes from what I've seen on
other galaxy s twos but we'll see what
this one scores on quadrant so hey yes
and I can see that bar is huge compared
to the rest and that's because the score
is 3709 so that's a really high quarter
score and honestly I know it's just a
benchmark but I feel like the device
actually lives up to that benchmark
score and the main reason I say that is
because over the last two or three weeks
that I've been using the device it
hasn't had any hiccups and it's handled
pretty much everything I've thrown at it
you know with no problem I'd say it's
even a little bit faster than the Galaxy
Nexus and the ACMA is 4G because in my
comparisons for the most part it beats
those other two out with the exception
of the web browser against the Galaxy
Nexus because of ICSS optimizations but
once this gets to update to ICS I feel
expect to perform at the same level if
not at a better level so that's enough
about the hardware let's look at the
software that's preloaded on this phone
because I think you get the idea it's
one of the fastest Android phones out
there if not the fastest but what that
sets about what's included with TouchWiz
and what Samsung included as far as apps
go so of course you have all share up
here you have Kies Air
I'm not going to go over the stock
Google Apps because you've seen those on
every Android device yet media hub you
have Nova 2 HD photo editor so this is
just a demo by the way that from Nova -
it's not the full game so you have photo
editor you have all your sprint
preloaded apps sprint TV and tell enough
if that's your thing I use Google
navigation but at least you have the
option on both on Sprint and oh one
thing that's really nice is these
preloaded apps are actually uninstalled
well now so show you right here so you
see Sprint TV sprint zone Sprint ID I
could actually go to my settings go to
applications manage applications and you
can see how the phones is flying through
the settings by the way so let's say I
didn't want sprint TV I could this
install that guy hit OK
boom it's gone and you can see it's gone
from here so I mean it's really nice to
see you know you could actually
understand apps that before you had a
root your phone to really get rid of
them so it really gives you the sense
that you could customize this phone to
be you know just the way you want even
though it has a custom overlay on it you
know kinda almost gives you like you
know a rooted experience without having
to be rooted you could even take
screenshots I mean all you gotta do is
press home and the power key and it
takes screenshots of that's pretty cool
of course that's the ICS future there's
a few ICS features that are new with the
Galaxy Nexus that are included with
touch with so it's like it kind of holds
you off until this gets the update but
I'm speaking of being able to customize
the phone to the way you want you could
resize the widgets which is really cool
because it lets you do things like that
so you can see the five-day forecast or
I could just see the weather alone
make it a little square like that so I
mean pretty cool options again this is a
ICS feature that's gonna come on the
phone regardless on any phone that gets
iced ICS but it's nice to see this phone
have it I mean granted this one also
came out six months before the Galaxy
Nexus did so pretty uh impressive to see
that on here you also have a editable
homescreen so I mean you have seven home
screens as default but you could press
menu hit edit and you can see I could
actually delete some of these home
screens so if I don't want them I get
taken them down all the way to one or up
to seven so again you can customize the
phone to just the way you like it if you
doubt the appleís to I mean you could
change the way it looks so you do a
customizable grade where you could order
it or have alphabetically like I do and
you can even make it a list if this
makes it easier for you to find your
apps so again it's a really customizable
really gives you a sense of control over
the phone we want to show you the photo
editor that's pre-loaded so I could see
already edited this picture of my dog I
want to do another picture let's do or
do this picture of the trees outside so
you see the quality of this camera by
the way it's just amazing but I'll go
ahead and edit it I'll do change the
saturation make it like that hit done so
it's really nice to have the ability to
edit photos on the go I mean before you
know you had to edit it on your computer
but now you can just edit right here and
that's natively its pre-installed on the
phone you know how to download out from
the market and this one works pretty
well too so nice to see that so another
thing I want to show you is the motion
settings on the phone is what they're
calling it so here's a picture I've
loaded up you could normally double tap
to zoom or you could you know pinch in
and pinch out to zoom but now what you
do is what they're calling motion
settings is you put two feet two fingers
on the screen and tilt it up and down
and it zooms in and out so that's pretty
cool you can do that with pictures and
the web browser you could also move
shortcuts around so normally you'd have
to move like
hold it here for like a few seconds and
you can see I mean Oh guys taking me for
our common last home screen alright but
anyway you die do you can move them
around like that but with motion
settings you could actually tilt the
foam and this makes it a lot easier to
pan around to what homescreen you want
so let's say I want to put it on this
first one like that drop it and that's
it so pretty cool feature right there
of course you have the notification bar
you have your toggle your Wi-Fi
Bluetooth GPS 4G and vibrate and sound
so it's really nice to see the shortcuts
right there
I know HTC has it we have to hit quick
settings and you get it I should prefer
this method because it's faster I mean
that's what trucks are about you know
how how long it take or how short it
takes to get to it which I said all
right you have lingo pre-installed on
the phone which is pretty cool
there's a review of lingo you can check
out on form of comm but that's pretty
much it on the samsung galaxy s2 i mean
you're gonna get a device that performs
really really well the web browser works
great and I've done comparison to get
some other devices so check it out home
for more calm and see how this one
stacks up
I really like the phone I recommend it
to you as long as I you think that you'd
be able to hold in your hand comfortably
because it is on the bigger side but you
know they make they made it really
really thin and really really light so
it kind of makes up for how big the
screen is
and when it's in your pocket it really
doesn't feel any bigger than an other
phone would I got a smaller phone but I
have noticed you know holding it with
one hand sometimes it can be difficult
to reach you know the opposite end the
screen you have to readjust your hand
readjust the way you're holding the
phone and kind of slide it down like
that which I you know may cause you to
drop it once in a while so I definitely
recommend getting a case if you plan on
getting this phone but otherwise I
really like it I recommend it I say it's
not one of the best answer phones I've
used to date definitely one of the
fastest so that's pretty much it is
