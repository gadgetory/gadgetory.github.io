in this video will show you how to send
and receive all those extra emoticons
that you know some of your friends may
have whether they have an iPhone or a
different Android phone and basically is
going to show you how to do it but first
I'm going to show you how to stock app
look so this is probably what your phone
looks like right now you have your
typical send field and of course your
message field type in hi really quick
and when you get back you can see
there's not very many other options you
can press menu and you do have some
Smiley's in here or some emoticons and
as you can see on the list isn't that
extensive so that's why we have this
video so I'm just going to go ahead and
go to the market and what you want to do
is download an app called Chomp SMS so I
already downloaded it install it on my
phone you don't necessarily have to use
Chomp SMS there's also another app
called ghost mess and a few others that
have the same functionality but since I
already installed it I'll go ahead and
show you how this one works so you can
see my message has already been imported
because it does import all your stock
messaging apps to this app and anyway
I'll type in the same message so hi
and I'm gonna hit this little plus icon
and you can see my list of emoticons so
these are kind of similar to the ones
that we saw with the stock Android app
our messaging app but when I click over
here it actually gives me the option to
install a plug-in an emoji add-on from
the market so I'll hit Play Store let's
go ahead and install this guy hit accept
and download
all right there you go so it's installed
now I'll go ahead and go back to the
Trump SMS app hit the plus sign again
and now when I go over here you actually
see I have a whole list of different
emoticons that I can scroll through for
the happy spaces I could also go through
little animals and a whole bunch of
different little symbols it's still
loading up right here but you get the
idea you have a whole bunch that you
know you normally wouldn't have and as
long as the person that you're sending
these to has you know the iPhone that
has this functionality or has an Android
phone that has this functionality like
an app like this um it'll work and
that's pretty much it thank you for
watching the video this is Dave mobile
comm and don't forget to visit foam
webcam or cell phone news reviews and
how to's thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
