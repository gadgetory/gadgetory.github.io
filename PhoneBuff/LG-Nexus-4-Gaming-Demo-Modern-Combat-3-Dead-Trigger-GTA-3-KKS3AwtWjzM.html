calm and in this video we're doing a
gaming demo on the LG Nexus 4 to give
you guys a better idea as far as the
gaming experience you'd expect out of
the Snapdragon s4 pro processor so go
ahead and skip to actual gameplay so you
guys can check that out I so I'll go
ahead and turn the volume up a little so
excuse my poor gameplay I'm trying to
play through the camcorder screen looks
like everyone is dead so try patience is
like the frame rates I mean looks pretty
good so far handling everything really
well throw a grenade up there see what
happens that's pretty cool little
explosion right there again frame rate
staying nice and smooth cool pet rock
reloj because i know i'm about to face
some guys here and i'll go ahead and do
what it wants me to so again everything
looks smooth so that's enough of modern
combat 3 we'll go ahead and go to the
next game which is going to be dead
trigger and I've mortal kombat 3 open up
in the background which hopefully gives
you a better day as far as multitasking
and you're just the sheer power of this
processor on the mixes for
I so I finally got a mission loaded
looks like this is actually just a
little simple one where I'm pretty much
when we shooting these zombies
everything looks really smooth start
trying to jump over try get some head
shots here and looks like that didn't
happen so again graphics look good game
informant seems just fine frame rate to
sing high so definitely a powerful
processor think we get that D as far as
that game goes and we'll do GTA finally
alright so I loaded up GTA 3 and we'll
go ahead and drive around a little bit
just to give you ID as far as how it
looks so let's get in and one of my
favorite parts about GTA is I'm not
going to follow the mission so try to
jump out of this car went wallets
driving so don't let me do that nope
looks like not so go ahead and try to
pick a fight with someone
okay doing a fight with the car okay
that guy's a gun that is not good yeah
don't bring a fist I guess to a gunfight
all right that bill is go ahead and try
it again alright cool got some money
let's get a new car no I don't want that
I whatever I'll take it all right forget
that I'm out of here and we'll just
drive around just a little bit more so
you get a better idea all right so
hopefully that gives you a better idea
as far as the gaming experience I was
gonna load up asphalt 7 but as of right
now it's actually seems to not be
supported fully because when I played it
has really really bad graphics so
obviously this thing could handle just
about anything you throw at it with this
quad core processor so I'm not going to
load that but anyway that's pretty much
it for me in this video if you found it
