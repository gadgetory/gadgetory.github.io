receiving many many requests today we're
going to be doing a speed test between
the Samsung Galaxy s6 the HTC One m9 and
the freshly updated iPhone 6 so if you
can subscribe to the channel for long
enough you know that we don't do your
regular speed test here and instead we
do it Bombo of style where we raise each
phone through a virtual obstacle course
to see which phone is the fastest let's
go ahead and get right into it alright
so as always all three phones are coming
off a fresh reboot and all three are
connected to the same Wi-Fi network
we'll start this thing off by taking a
picture on each phone and then move on
to the gallery app where no phone has
created any kind of real separation but
as we load up the first game in this
test in smash hit the galaxy s6 with
this octa-core processor just powers
through to take lead as we move on to
Temple Run 2 with the galaxy s6 further
increasing its lead as it finishes up
Temple Run to the one m9 and iPhone 6
are neck-and-neck with the iPhone 6 just
barely edging it out as it moves on to
Photoshop Touch so at this point all
three phones are about an app apart from
each other with the one m9 and last
working on score mobile the iPhone 6 and
second getting started with Netflix and
the Galaxy s6 in the lead already on the
browser test loading cnn.com but
fortunately for the iPhone 6 and one m9
we're just finishing up with the first
lap of this test so there's still is
time to make a comeback in the second
lab where we test each phone's
multitasking abilities the iPhone 6
finishes the first lap seven seconds
after the galaxy s6 at one minute
exactly with the one m9
finishing six seconds after that at one
minute and six so so far the Galaxy s6
has had to reload both smash it in
Temple Run 2 which leaves the door open
for the other two phones to make a
comeback and actually the one m9 has had
every single app ready to go in the
background with it just flying through
this second lap overtaking the galaxy s6
and finishing with a total time of 1
minute and 27 seconds the iPhone 6
having most of its apps ready to go in
the background also passes the s6 with
the time of
one minute and 34 and now the s6
finishes with a time of 1 minute and 37
ok so those were very interesting
results the phone that finished the
entire test first was the one m9 even
though it actually took the longest to
finish the first lab the phone that
finished the test last was the galaxy s6
even though it was actually the quickest
to finish the first lab so take what you
want from these results if you want a
phone that finishes loading a single
abdi fastest go with the galaxy s6 if
you want a phone that offers the
smoothest multitasking go with the HTC
One m9 and if you want something that
falls somewhere in between goatee iPhone
6 but that about does it for me in this
video thank you guys for watching in as
always I'll see you in the very next
episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
