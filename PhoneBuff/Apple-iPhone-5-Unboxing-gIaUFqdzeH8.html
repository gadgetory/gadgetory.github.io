phonebook calm and in this wouldn't be
unboxing the brand new Apple iPhone 5 so
you can see I have the box right over
here I just ripped off the little
plastic material first but I haven't
opened it just yet see the iPhone 5
little logo right here Apple logo force
a picture of the iPhone 5 on the side I
got the black version it's a 16 gigabyte
model go ahead and open this guy up
first thing you gonna be met with is the
iPhone 5s there's nothing on you know
this side of the box so go ahead and
push that out of the way pull this guy
out and Wow
you know my first impression really is
that this guy is really really light I
mean this is just 112 grams and weight
and definitely feels like I mean it's
probably the lightest phone i've ever
you know held almost feels like a phone
you know like when it doesn't have a
battery in it that's what it feels like
right now but i'll go ahead and power it
on while i'm you know giving you a quick
tour of it so you can see the buddha
been animation is pretty much the same
has been you know all the while you know
the same was the iPhone 4s just the
Apple logo I'll go ahead and peel off
the front protective plastic go ahead
and do on the back alright and I see
this material over here is a little bit
different got that anodized backing I'm
got a little smudge on there gotta clean
that off but worry about that later same
thing going on the front you know just
that Apple logo got your speaker grill
on the back at the lightning adapter
right over here you could put in a SIM
card over here got the power button over
here now headphone jack is actually at
the bottom now and the left side you
have your typical volume rocker buttons
and then the little switch if I switch
that over you see how it looks it's red
in there you can't really see it on
camera but it is red like it's always
been for it though because all the
materials black it doesn't really show
looks like it is done so you see that
longer screen at four inches giving you
326 PPI this phone is only seven point
six millimeters thick so it's definitely
you know thinner than some of the other
devices out there going to show you my
galaxy s3 and this guy and you know you
can see it does look thinner than the
galaxy s3 especially cuz it's curved
back I mean when you look at the top
doesn't look as bad but definitely is
thinner so we'll go ahead
and look at the box now enough of you
know look in the phone I'll be doing the
review and all that good stuff you guys
could watch that you know tune in for
that got the little possum that holds it
in here we have probably just a little
documents and stuff as always this hello
and teaches you how to use this thing
while you you know look at this really
you got foam book because I'm here to
tell you that got the here warranty got
some apple stickers out over here so if
you want to stop us slap that on the
back of your iPhone or on your computer
whatever you want move that out of the
way so now we have these three point
five millimeter you know headphones
these are ear pods so they're not going
with the typical you know headphones
that they used to which is nice comes in
its own little case so gives you more of
a finished product feeling it's almost
as if you know you bought this
separately really cool so I'm going to
try to open this guy up so opens up just
like that and you can see it is you know
three point five millimeters it's gonna
fit right into it and you can see how
it's designed now it's know it pretty
much goes more into you here you know
Apple talked a lot about this so I'll
probably be doing a review about it
later but for now I'll just leave you
here and put it back in this little case
looks all nice got your adapter for the
Lightning USB cable or yeah so here's
the lightning cable so it's pretty small
me about the size of like a micro USB as
far as this side over here which you
know plugs in right into the bottom of
the iPhone really easy to slip in and
out you know Google both ways so uh
anyway uh you can see the other end is
USB as regular and there's nothing else
in here um I can't even pull this guy
out so but that's pretty much it for the
iPhone 5 unboxing yeah as you can see
the device you know take one last look
at it I'll go ahead and I should at
least unlock it right so unlock choose
English United States trying to find a
cell your connection will you sell your
see if it works it's gotta activate my
phone but anyway we'll just do one more
360 tour of the iPhone 5 giving you a
better idea of sparse how it looks and
uh you might want to do a you know size
comparison really quick I'll probably
doing later but here you go here's my
Galaxy s3
here's iPhone 5se SC it's not you know
that much smaller compared to like how
the iPhone 4s looked because it is
taller however this guy's like I bought
the same thinness or a width of the
iPhone 4s just maybe a little bit
thinner we'll go ahead and enable that
setup as new iPhone let's go ahead and
do that for now continue skip agree
agree come on let me get into it so
there he go will automatically send and
then start using iPhone finally there
you go
we have the iPhone 5s home screen you
can see you have an extra row of apps
that we could put on the home screen
which is pretty cool throw them into the
settings real quick but anyways that's
pretty much it for this unboxing
