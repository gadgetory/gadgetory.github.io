7 and 7 plus are just around the corner
and while Apple hasn't given us anything
official as to what to expect there has
been a bunch of new rumors and leaks so
today we're gonna go over the top 10
things we think we know about Apple's
upcoming flagships let's get right into
it
one similar design so the first thing a
lot of rumors and leaks are suggesting
is a similar design to the iPhone 6 and
6s now historically Apple came out with
in all new design every other year but
for whatever reason it doesn't look like
that's the case this time around and
instead the new iPhones will get only a
refresh with something suggesting more
subtle antenna lines that only go across
the bottom and the top and possibly a
thinner body that may be as thin as the
6.1 millimeter iPod touch there's also a
photo that showed a new space black
color option that may be coming which I
really hope turns out to be true since
that way you can at least get an iPhone
7 that looks different from the old
iPhones to no headphone jack the rumor
that Apple's removing the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack has held up for quite
some time and if this rumor turns out to
be true it obviously means that you
won't be able to use your current
headphones with the iPhone 7 at least
not without an adapter yes this sucks
as do all changes this drastic but
Apple's actually not the first one to do
it with some other phone manufacturers
already having made the move so it seems
like that's the direction the industry
is slowly heading in and hopefully Apple
at least includes a 3.5 millimeter to
lightning adapter in the Box three
bigger battery the removal of the
headphone jack may not be all bad as it
can allow for a thinner phone like
mentioned earlier possibly a second
speaker where the headphone jack used to
be or maybe even allow for a larger
battery with the extra internal space
and one rumor is suggesting just that
saying that the iPhone 7 may come with a
nineteen hundred and sixty million
battery compared to these seventeen
hundred and fifteen million battery
found in the success if this turns out
to be true it should translate into
about an extra hour of battery life
which is definitely welcome but I do
have my doubts about this one as a
thinner phone doesn't usually come with
a bigger battery so will either get a
thinner iPhone or one with a bigger
battery and knowing Apple they'll
probably go for a thinner phone so I'm
not getting my hopes up for better
cameras the cameras on both the iPhone 7
and seven-plus will likely get a pretty
big upgrade with something showing a
larger camera on the iPhone 7 suggesting
better low-light capabilities and maybe
even optical image stabilization the
iPhone 7 plus on the other hand may get
an all-new dual camera system which in
addition to offering better low-light
performance may even allow for optical
zoom with 1lu lenses being for wide
shots and another for zoom considering
how good Samsung made the s7 s camera I
can see this rumored panning out as
Apple probably knows they need something
big to keep the iPhone's camera
competitive 5 a third model so we're
obviously expecting a regular and A+
version of the iPhone 7 but some early
rumors were pointing towards a third
option being dubbed the iphone 7 pro but
since then some other rumors of commands
said that the iphone 7 pro does
originally planned will become the
iPhone 7 plus so there's no telling if
there actually be a third option but
either way whatever Apple ends up
calling this third option or the
high-end option it's rumored to have the
dual camera system that we talked about
earlier along with a smart connector
which we'll be talking about next six
smart connector okay so I don't know
about this one but there is one
supposedly that shows either an iPhone 7
plus or an iphone 7 pro with a smart
connector like on the iPad the smart
connector lets you connect the
accessories like a keyboard to an iPad
so a keyboard on the iPhone I guess
would be cool I don't know how much of a
market there actually is for that but if
Apple ends up actually doing this
they'll probably have some other
accessories in store like maybe a way to
wirelessly charge the phone which would
be go7 3d touch home button an
interesting new rumor is that the iPhone
7 won't have a physical home button
which has been part of the iPhones DNA
since day one and instead it'll be
replaced by a 3d touch digital button
that'll sit nice and flush along the
front
now while the new button won't
physically click in which is something I
know that I'll miss it will come with
haptic feedback which in theory should
at least make it feel more like a
physical button but we'll see eight
water and dust resistance so one thing
that I phone users have been envying
since the day Samsung first announced
the galaxy s7 is water and dust
resistance but if it rumors suggesting
that the iPhone 7 will be waterproof
turns out to be true those days will be
long gone and honestly I can see this
rumour panning out as for one I think
Apple knows that it needs water
does resistance to compete with the
Galaxy s7 and - there's a good chance
that the iPhone 7 won't have a headphone
jack or a physical home button so
there'll be two less things that Apple
has to worry about ceiling 9 more base
storage some rumors are suggesting that
Apple will finally ditch the 16 gigabyte
base model and up the base model to 32
gigabytes which is long overdue rumours
are also suggesting that these storage
options will go all the way up to 256
gigabytes compared to the current max at
128 so if 128 gigabytes somehow isn't
enough for you the iPhone 7 may have you
covered 10 release date okay so probably
the rumor you want to hear about most is
when you can actually expect to get the
iPhone 7 in your hands well right now
rumors are suggesting an official
announcement by Apple on September 7th
with pre-orders opening up two days
later on September 9 the release date is
currently being pegged as September 16th
but I wouldn't be surprised at a
September 23rd release they've either to
give it a full two weeks from
announcement to release date all right
so those are the top 10 rumors and leaks
about the iPhone 7 and 7 plus of course
these are all just speculation at this
point and nothing is confirmed but the
good news is it shouldn't be too long
before Apple officially unveiled the
iPhone and you can bet that when they do
we'll have a bunch of coverage on it as
soon as we get anyways that is it for me
in this video thank you guys for
watching it as always I'll see you in
the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
