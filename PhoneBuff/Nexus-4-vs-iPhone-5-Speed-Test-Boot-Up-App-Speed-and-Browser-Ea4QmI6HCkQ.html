buff calm and in this video we're gonna
be doing a speed comparison test between
the LG Nexus 4 and the Apple iPhone 5 to
see which phone is faster out of the two
now both phones have amazing hardware
the Nexus 4 has a Snapdragon s4 pro quad
core processor with 2 gigabytes of RAM
while the iPhone 5 has a custom-made
Apple a6 dual core with 1 gigabyte of
RAM and of course these two devices have
different operating systems with the
Nexus 4 running on Android 4.2 jelly
bean and the iPhone 5 running on iOS 6
alright so let's go ahead and get right
into it so the first test is the boot up
so we'll power on both devices at the
same time and let them load up their
respective os's and while these two are
loading I'll let you guys know that both
devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi
network and that all browsing history
and cache has been wiped so it's gonna
be a nice and even test or at least as
even as we could get it we'll go ahead
and wait and see which phone actually
shows the lock screen first all right so
the iPhone 5 shows the lock screen first
now let's go ahead and wait and see
which one actually connects to the
network first and that is the LG Nexus 4
so the two kind of offset each other
making the boot abscessed a tie alright
so with the boot of test done let's go
ahead and go on to the next test which
is the app speed test so the first tab
will open up is gonna be Instagram so
what's happening at the same time and
you can see it loaded up faster on the
Nexus 4 we'll go ahead and exit out of
here and the next app will open up is
going to be Facebook so tap those at the
same time and you can see this time we
loaded up faster on the iPhone 5 and now
loaded up on the Nexus 4 so we'll exit
out of here and we'll open up the Amazon
mobile app and this one was actually
closed but I'll give the win to the
iPhone 5 because it did load the
pictures first so we'll exit out of here
and now we'll open up Flixter and again
we saw the content maybe a split second
faster on the iPhone 5 we'll go ahead
and go to the box office tab to see if
we gets more separation and yeah so this
time you actually see that you know the
iPhone 5 loaded the pictures first so
it's a clear win for the iPhone 5 we'll
go ahead and open up score Center and
again we saw the content first
the iPhone 5 so go ahead and exit out of
here and we'll open up Twitter this time
and this time the Nexus 4 gets a win so
we'll go ahead and press home and we'll
open up the YouTube app here so we're
waiting to see which phone is actually
gonna load up the content first and it
looks like the Nexus 4 yep the Nexus 4
is about done and now the iPhone 5 is
catching up so the win goes to the Nexus
4 and our final app will be the camera
and then loaded up just a little bit
faster on the iPhone 5 so the official
tally for the app speed test is 5 to 3
in the iPhone 5s favour all right so so
far these two devices tied in the first
test and the iPhone 5 won in a second so
let's go on to the third which is the
browser speed test all right so the
first test we'll do is load up foam both
calm so we'll go ahead and tap on the
articles at the same time and while
these guys are loading I'll let you guys
know that you know paying attention to
the status bar alone isn't necessarily
the most reliable indicator as far as
when a webpage is done loading in this
case if you actually watch the content
you can see that the ads and the
thumbnails load up faster in the nexus 4
despite the status bars loading at the
same time so the win actually goes to
the nexus 4 we'll go ahead and tap on
this article over here for our second
test and in this case looks like they're
neck-and-neck status bar actually
finishes first on the Nexus 4 but if you
pay attention to the YouTube videos you
can see that they actually finished
loading at about the same time so this
one's actually a tie so for our third
browser test well go ahead and load up
engadget.com so we'll tap on these links
at the same time and it seemed like the
iPhone 5 loaded up all the content maybe
a half second or maybe even less than
that faster than the Nexus 4 so the win
goes to the iPhone 5 here we'll scroll
down to the bottom and tap on the
desktop link to try to see if we get a
bigger margin between the two
so this website has a whole bunch of
content to load so it's gonna take quite
some time for each device and it looks
like the iPhone 5 loaded up most of the
banners and ads first and now I got that
Windows Phone 8 banner so the wind does
go to the iPhone 5 in this case we'll go
ahead and tap on this article right over
here for our third and final test on
engage comm seeing the content first on
the iPhone 5c some banners on the iPhone
5 and just about everything is done now
on the iPhone 5 so the win goes to the
iPhone 5 here for our next test we'll go
to 18 T comm so I'll go ahead and tap on
the links at the same time and it looks
like it's redirecting to the mobile site
iPhone 5 is done loading and now the
Nexus 4 is downloading so the win again
goes to the iPhone 5 so we'll go ahead
and load up the full site on both phones
opened up in new tabs and so far it
looks like the iPhone 5 actually has a
lead as far as loading all the content
and the iPhone 5 is done followed by the
Nexus 4 so that one was really close
maybe only a half second difference but
nonetheless the edge does go to the
iPhone 5 so the official tally is 2 to 1
for the browser speed test with the
iPhone 5 loading up both AT&amp;amp;T and
Engadget faster and the Nexus 4 loading
up bone Bluff faster ok so that
concludes the speed test between the
iPhone 5 and the Nexus 4 obviously both
phones are super super fast
both were neck-and-neck for most of the
speed test here but in the end the wind
does go to the iPhone 5 mainly because
they edged out the Nexus in both the
browser test and the app speed test
