we're taking a look at the night cable
from native Union
now this isn't your typical iPhone USB
cable nope it's an iPhone USB cable that
comes with a twist or should I say a
knot but before we dive in I want to
thank native union for making this video
possible as well as let you guys know
about a giveaway they're offering where
you guys can get a chance to win not
only this cable but some of their other
cables as well including a keychain
charging cable a two-in-one cable and a
battery booster by signing out for their
newsletter which will be linked for you
down below in the description so the
first thing you'll notice about this
cable is it's lame the days of having to
use your phone while lying in bed like
this because the cables not long enough
are gone at 10 feet you'll be able to
comfortably use it on your back like
this on your other side or if you really
wanted to you could roll over to the
other end of the bed without ever having
to unplug your phone but seriously after
having a ten-foot cable you'll never
want to go back to the standard one
which is only three feet long the second
thing worth mentioning about this cable
is the material it's made out of nylon
so it won't get all tangled up tangled
cables are my sworn enemies we've gotta
be in here in the studio that's full of
them that I avoid at all costs but aside
from it not getting tangled the nylon
also makes it feel more premium and
durable than most standard cables last
but not least is the weight is not the
main feature on this thing I don't know
how many times I've gone home late and
my girlfriend is already sleeping so I
can't just turn on the lights cuz
otherwise should get super annoyed with
me and I sit there searching for the
cable in order to be able to charge my
phone and that whole process is
eliminated with this way to not you
simply set it down and it'll stay
exactly where you left it which is
freaking awesome the way to not is also
adjustable so you can actually move it
along like this
and back up wherever you want it so that
way you give yourself more or less flak
depending on what you need so that way
you're never gonna be bending the wire
the cable or the charging port on your
phone which is pretty dope for those of
you who are interested in picking one of
these up it's available on both iPhones
and microUSB Android phones I'll be
putting all the links that you need down
below in the description other than that
that is it from me in this video I'll
see you guys in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
