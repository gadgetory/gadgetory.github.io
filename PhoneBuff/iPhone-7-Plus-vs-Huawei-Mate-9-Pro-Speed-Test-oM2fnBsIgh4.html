it's been a while since the last video
okay it's been a couple of weeks since I
last uploaded here on YouTube but if you
guys followed me on Twitter you know
that at the end of 2016 I was on holiday
break and when I got back I had the bad
luck of getting sick I'm actually still
a little bit under the weather so excuse
my nasally voice but if you guys are
following me I'm at bomba
pretty much everywhere so if you guys
wanna stay in the loop you guys want to
have the best way to contact me I'll be
putting links down below in the
description I'm also doing facebook
livestream so if you guys follow me
there I'll be a lot of fun but anyways
I'm finally back and I'm back with the
video that you guys have been heavily
requesting and that is a speed test
between these two phones right you got
the iPhone 7 plus and probably the
number one contender right now and the
huawei mate 9 now while we've been
talking this going up okay I've been
talking about how it's really fast and
how it uses machine learning to stay
fast over time I get optimizes itself so
I'm excited to see how it stacks up
against the iPhone this is the pro model
so it's got 6 gigabytes ram instead of
only 4 and of course it has the same
keren 960 processor found in a normal
may 9 but what that said let's go ahead
and get right into it alright look at
things off like we always do by starting
the stopwatch is on each phone and then
immediately taking a selfie where the
main nine Pro and it's quicker
animations gets the lead over the iPhone
7 plus already moving on to the second
row where the iPhone is actually
struggling a bit on the Facebook app
along the main 90 jump even further
ahead early on in the speed set but it
passed the tests or any indicator the
may 9 Pro is going to need all the help
it can get early on as the iPhone has
proven to be a beast when it comes to
the more processor intensive apps like
lasted where it actually closes the gap
between it in the main nine so going
into the gaming row both phones are neck
and neck as they work on subway surfers
where it looks like the iPhone has
actually taken the lead but if you know
what subway surfers and moving on to
flip guys but unlike many phones that
have come before it the main and Pro is
still hanging in there only a half step
or so behind the iPhone so it actually
has a real shot at making a comeback not
only in the second map with a 6
gigabytes of RAM but right here in the
first lab which is pretty damn
impressive but the iPhone 7 plus
sitting at the title of fumble style
speedtest champ or not
with this blazing through the asphalt 8
and finishing up with smash hit here
putting it a full app ahead as it starts
working on the last leg of this first
lap so with the mainline finishing the
gaming row it joins the iPhone in the
last row here as it powers through
Spotify and starts loading up ESPN as
the iPhone is now working on loading
both the mobile and the full versions of
the Amazon website and there you go the
iPhone 7 plus finishes the first lap
with a time of 1 minute and 24 seconds
with the may 9 pro coming in only 6
seconds later with the time of 1 minute
and 30 so this is the closest any phone
has ever come to be throwing the iPhone
7 plus with the may 9 pro and it takes a
gigabytes of RAM looking to make its
final run here in the second lap and
heartbreaker the may 9 Pro fails to keep
Photoshop ready to go in the background
which that's in fact 4 seconds in the
second lap but the make does have all
the other apps ready to go including the
heavy duty games however it looks like
it's too little too late as the iPhone
finishes the second lap with a total
time of 1 minute and 56 seconds where
the main item pro finishes 10 seconds
later at the time of 2 minutes and 6
seconds making the winner and still
fumble style sweet says champ the iPhone
7 plus but damn those a close one
anyways that is it for me in this video
thank you guys for watching and as
always I'll see you in the very next
episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
