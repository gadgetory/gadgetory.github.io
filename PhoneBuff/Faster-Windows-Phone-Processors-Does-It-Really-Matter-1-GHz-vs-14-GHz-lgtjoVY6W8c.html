from fumble calm and today we comparing
the one gigahertz processor you're
seeing on windows phones last year in
this case it's the 87 and the 1.4 Gears
processor we're seeing more and more of
this year with Windows Phones and in
this case it's the Samsung Focus s so
I'm just going to do a comparison test
between the two as far as which one's
faster
I'm obviously we expect the one on the
right to be faster considering
everything else is equal but how much
faster is what I really want to show you
to help you determine whether or not
it's actually worth it to spend the
extra money on a 1.4 gigawatts there's a
1 so I'll go ahead and hit flicker at
the same time
and they can see opened up maybe a half
a second or a second faster at most on
the folks s with the faster processor
I'll hit home on both and we'll open up
let's just go do Internet Explorer I
clear out the history on both phones and
they're both running on the same Wi-Fi
network so the first website we'll go to
is nfl.com cuz has a lot of content on
there and I will get a good comparison
so I fell calm and at the same time and
they can see the screen populates first
on the focus s with that faster
processor I'll let you know as soon as
each one's done so you can kind of get a
idea as far as how much faster so it's
done on the focus s and it's done on the
HT 7 now so we'll do another test cuz I
was talking a little too much so we'll
do yahoo.com and uh y'all going this one
it calm and I'll just let you know as
soon as each one's done so they're off
and the focus is done and this one's
really making a difference I don't know
what it is on Yahoo but definitely is
making a difference as far as how fast
the hd7 is loading is definitely going a
lot slower and it's done now so that's a
big difference and last thing we'll test
is just being I was hit search on both
phones at the same time and you can see
it opened up faster on the focus s but
not that much and then I'll do a voice
search weather all right so we got the
results already on the folks s followed
by the hd7 just a little bit after so as
you can see from these tests the system
apps or just the applications in general
load up just about the same I mean
they're a little bit faster than the
folks s but it's nothing too big where
you know it's worth spending an extra
$100 or so but the web browser is really
what makes the difference as you can see
switch with that Yahoo test and loaded
up I'd say at least a good 40% faster
than this so especially doesn't lie as
far as the web browsers go but
everything else it's a negligible
difference but those are the results all
right thank you for watching the video
and don't forget to visit pump up comm
for more cellphone news reviews and how
to's thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
