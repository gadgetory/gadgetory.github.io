we're gonna be taking a look at the
zerolemon solar juice external battery
pack which has a crazy battery capacity
at 20,000 milliamps enough to charge
most phones anywhere between 7 to 12
times off of a single charge and as
impressive as that sounds the capacity
isn't necessarily the most standout
future on the solar juice in fact if the
name of the device itself hasn't already
given it away the standout feature at
least in my opinion is this solar panel
that takes the entire front of the
device allowing you to charge the
battery pack with nothing more than the
power of light now is the solar panel
the only way you can charge the battery
pack of course not there's a microUSB
port right here on the side and honestly
this is what you're gonna want to use
more often than not as it charges the
battery pack much quicker than these
solar panels about 10 times faster but
in those situations where you run out of
juice when you're out camping or hiking
spending the day on the beach or maybe
you get stranded on a deserted island I
don't know what you guys do having a
battery pack with a solar panel built in
to effectively give you self sustained
energy it's a pretty cool feature to
have moving on next thing I want to talk
about is the build quality and design of
the solar juice so this thing is a bit
hefty and that's kind of to be expected
since it has such a large capacity and
it also features a very rugged and
seemingly well-built design that
zerolemon claims is both shock resistant
and rain resistant so this thing could
handle being rough house a little and is
built for an active lifestyle at the top
of the battery pack you have this little
buckle here that actually attaches to
this included hook so that way you can
put it on your backpack put it on your
gear and not only gain a little bit of
portability but also keep the battery
pack exposed instead of having it tucked
away in a pocket or in your bag so
you'll actually be able to get a little
bit of juice from the solar panel while
you're out and about at the bottom you
have two USB ports one of which is a 5
volt 2.1
port the other a 5 volt 1 amp port so
this one's actually gonna be for your
larger devices that are more
power-hungry like a tablet this one for
the smaller devices like a phone or a
camera and that what's cool is you can
actually use both ports at the same time
so you could have your iPad on one side
your phone on the other and charge both
of them completely and because the
capacity is so big probably still have
enough juice left over for the next
couple of days what's also interesting
is in between those 2 USB ports you have
a small LED light that you activate by
pressing the power button so actually I
think you have to press and hold and it
should turn on there you go so what
bright enough to temporarily blind me
it's about I'd say the same as your
typical LED flash on a smartphone nice
little feature to have built right into
the battery pack and the last thing I
want to show you guys are these four LED
lights here at the bottom of the front
so you just activate them by just
tapping the power button and up to four
lights could actually light up so when
you have four lit up it means that you
are good to go close to 100% battery
three of them light up you're at 75% to
at 50 and so on giving you an idea as to
how much juice you have left so when
there's two lights on you're at about
let's say close to 10,000 milliamps
which because the thing is so huge is
actually about the capacity of most
other battery packs out there so you're
gonna be able to go for a long period of
time without having to worry about
charging this thing so overall it's a
pretty cool battery pack a little bit
different from what I'm used to
typically seeing but I think it could be
a great option for somebody looking for
a battery pack with a huge capacity so
you don't have to charge it as often and
also somebody who wants something that
could be rugged and durable enough to
handle an active lifestyle the solar
juice is available for half off right
now on phone book deals it's also
available on Amazon I'll be putting all
the links you need down below in the
description so if you guys are
interested check that out but other than
that that is pretty much it for me in
this video thank you guys for watching
and as always I'll see you in the very
next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
