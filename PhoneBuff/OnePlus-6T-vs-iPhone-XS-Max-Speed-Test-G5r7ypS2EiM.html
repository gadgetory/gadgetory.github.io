championship matchup we have all been
waiting for is finally here where the
oneplus 60 will defend one Plus's reign
as the bump of style speech champ
against easily the number one contender
India iPhone 10s max taking a look at
the spec sheets both of these phones are
packing a punch the iPhone is powered by
Apple's 8-12 Bionic chip and four
gigabytes of RAM while the oneplus 60
has pretty much the same specs that we
saw in one plus 6 with a snapdragon 845
and AIDS gigabytes of ram but what's
different is it's now running on android
9.0 and with the 61 plus baked in their
new smart boost technology which takes
advantage of all that extra RAM to cache
apps for faster boot up times so it'll
be interesting to see if the oneplus
sixty can challenge the iPhone in the
first lap and if the four gigabytes of
RAM on the iPhone will be enough to
compete with the eight gigabytes on the
60 while the 60 remain undefeated or
will the iPhone Telus Mac's become the
new form of style speedtest champ let's
find out

this championship matchup underway by
starting the stopwatch is on each phone
and then jumping into the first row
where the 1 plus 60 pulls ahead right
out of the gates loading both Facebook
and Starbucks at a faster rates going
into Microsoft Word
it looks like the iPhone was able to
erase the 1 plus sixties early lead
taking the lead for itself as it moves
on to excel with the 60 falling just a
split second behind it both the iPhone
also loading excel at a faster rate it's
able to improve on its lead as it moves
on to the second row taking a selfie and
now working on editing that selfie by
adding a filter and exporting the image
out to storage while the iPhone has been
able to create a little bit of
separation for itself
the oneplus 60 has actually done a good
job at not falling too far behind but at
the same time the 60 isn't making up any
ground here in Premiere along the iPhone
to further improve on its lead as it
just blazes through the browser tests
and moves on to the gaming row which is
where historically the iPhone has
outright dominated the competition so
it'll be interesting to see how much of
a difference that new smart boost
feature on the 1 plus 60 can actually
make if it can at least minimize how far
the iPhone pulls ahead of the 60 here in
the gaming row the oneplus has a real
shot at making a comeback mattress later
in the second lap but as early as the
last few apps in the first and so far it
looks like the 1 plus 60 is holding its
own while it didn't load subway surfers
or flip diving at a faster rates it also
didn't load those games significantly
slower either which is something you
couldn't say about some of the other
phones that we've tested as the iPhone
10s max finishes up with Spotify and
starts working on yes
on the 1 plus 60 is working on the last
game here in bullet force loading the
game just a hair slower than the iPhone
and then just ripping through Spotify as
the 60 moves on to ESPN the iPhone
finishes up with Amazon finishing the
first stop with a time of 1 minute and
47 seconds so while the 1 plus 60 wasn't
able to make a comeback in the first lap
it was able to finish it just 9 seconds
later with the time of 1 minute and 56
seconds putting it in position to
possibly make a comeback here in the
second lap where we know that the iPhone
and it's 4 gigabytes of RAM can't quite
keep all the apps open at the end of
course that may not even matter
considering the amount of cushion that
the iPhone was able to build for itself
but either way this one is likely gonna
come down to the wire
where as expected the iPhone fails to
keep Starbucks open and surprisingly the
1 plus 60 fails to keep Excel open
allowing the iPhone to cruise to the
finish line with a total time of 2
minutes and 28 seconds with one plus 60
and it's whopping 8 gigabytes of RAM
also failing to keep Word and Starbucks
open but it did manage to keep Facebook
open finishing the test 18 seconds later
with a time of 2 minutes and 46 seconds
making the winner and new fumble style
speedtest champ
the iPhone 10's max in case you're
wondering we ran this test over and over
and we even waited for the 1 plus 60 to
receive a couple of software updates and
ran the test again and the results here
were consistent anyways that is it for
me in this video thank you guys for
watching and as always I'll see you in
the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
