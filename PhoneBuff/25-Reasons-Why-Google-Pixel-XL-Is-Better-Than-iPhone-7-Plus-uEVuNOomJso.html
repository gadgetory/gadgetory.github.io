picks walks out and the iPhone 7 plus
are two great phones that do a lot of
the same things so in this two-part
Bumble style video series we're gonna be
looking at the differences and reasons
why each of these phones can be
considered better than the other but
before we get into it I want to give a
big shout out to video box.com for
sponsoring today's video
so video box has one of the largest
stock video libraries on the web with
over two million stock videos after
effects and motion backgrounds and
within membership you get access to not
only two million clips for 40% off but
you also get over a hundred thousand
clips included for free with your
membership as well all memberships come
with a 100% royalty free agreement so
you can use their videos and all your
commercial projects from your blog to
your YouTube channel like I do and this
agreement is still valid
even if you cancel your membership so no
matter what you are protected from
getting sued by copyright holders when
you get your footage from video box
usually priced at $149 for a year for
this holiday season video box is
offering an exclusive $50 discount so
click on that first link down below in
the description to get $50 off your
annual membership or go to video box.com
slash holidays alright let's get to the
reasons reason number one Google
assistance the new Google assistant lets
you have a more natural conversation
with Google answering not just your
initial questions but follow-up
questions as well with its contextual
ability capable of keeping track of the
conversation and even capable of
scanning what's on your screen to give
you relevant information without you
even having to ask to notification
access the fingerprint scanner on the
back of the phone does more than just
unlock your device with a downward swipe
pulling the notification shade down and
an upward swipe putting it back up
giving you quick and easy access to your
missed messages 3 USB OTG with the
included adapter in the Box you can
easily connect things like a keyboard a
mouse or a USB flash drive just as you
would with a desktop computer for
multiple users with support for multiple
users you can create a completely
separate user account for someone like a
kid so they can have all the apps and
games they want on their accounts
without those apps and games
up on your account and maybe more
importantly they won't be able to see
your text messages or emails or anything
else that you want to keep secure reason
number five background updates while
software updates are great they can get
annoying as they render your phone
useless while the update is being
installed but with the pixel this isn't
as much of an issue as the OS updates
are downloaded and installed
automatically in the background meaning
no more waiting around for your phone to
update six LED notifications when your
screen is off and you have a missed
notification this is what you see on the
iPhone 7 plus absolutely nothing on the
pixel XL you have a physical LED light
that will flash blue for email yellow
for snapshot and so on which at a glance
will not only let you know that you have
a missed notification but also help you
decide whether or not you want to check
your phone right that moment 7 file
manager this allows you to manage the
files on your phone just as you would on
a desktop computer you can see all the
folders on your phone and the files
within them and have the ability to drag
and drop content from your phone onto a
computer like you would with a flash
drive 8 - our return policy the pixel
xl's app store has a two-hour return
period where you can return an app
easily right from the phone itself so
you can try an app and if you don't like
it you won't be stuck with a purchase 9
battery life estimates based off of your
daily usage the pixel Excel can give you
an estimate of how long you can expect
your phone's battery to last making it
easier to decide whether or not you need
to stop and recharge and when you do
recharge it'll even give you an estimate
of how long it will take to get to 100%
reason number 10 fast charging speaking
of charging with this rapid charger the
pixel Excel can get up to seven hours of
battery life from just 15 minutes of
charged time so if you forget to charge
your phone overnight you can just put it
on charge for a few minutes and know
that you'll pretty much be good for the
rest of the day 11 custom launchers with
the launchers in the Google pixel excel
you can make your home screen look and
work exactly the way you want it from
assigning special gestures to open up an
app
to customizing each individual icon
making your phone truly yours twelve
more capable widgets yes the iPhone
technically has widgets now but it's
limited to just one screen with the
pixel you can put widgets on multiple
screens just about anywhere you want for
example you can put a post a note right
on your home screen and have your full
monthly calendar on another thirteen
system control one of the biggest
differences between iOS and Android is
how much control you have over your
phone with the pixel letting you tweak
things from how fast your animations are
in developer settings to which icon show
up in the notification bar and system
tuner giving you complete control over
your experience 14 split-screen
multitasking with split-screen
multitasking you can use two apps on the
screen at the same time for example you
can open up your shopping list and
calculator to be able to quickly add
things up instead of having to go back
and forth between the two apps reason
number 15 better VR with its higher
resolution display and the resulting
pixel density the pixel XL offers a
noticeably sharper and crisper VR
experience add to that support for
Google's daydream platform and the
dedicated headsets and the pixel excel
easily has the edge for virtual reality
16 quick camera launch from any screen
on or off no matter what app you're in
you can quickly launch the camera with a
double tap of the power button so that
way you never miss a photo 17 default
applications you can set up new default
applications allowing you to permanently
replace a system app with one of your
choosing for example that quick camera
launch feature we just talked about it
can actually be set up to open up
snapchat instead of the regular camera
18 wider angle selfies the 8 megapixels
selfie cam on the pixel excel has a much
wider lens than the one on the iPhone
meaning you can fit more people or
background into your selfie without the
need of a selfie stick 19 no protruding
camera lens the pixel XL doesn't have a
protruding camera like on the iPhone 7
plus which means you can use it while
it's lying flat on a desk without
constantly rocking back and forth like
the iPhone does reason number 20
unlimited full resolution photo storage
included with the purchase of the google
pick
so is unlimited photo and video storage
in full resolution meaning every one of
your 12 megapixel photos and every
detail of your 4k videos can be backed
up in the cloud unlimited for free 21
less obtrusive volume indicator unlike
the iPhone the pixels volume indicator
doesn't cover almost half your screen so
when you're watching a video on Facebook
and decide to change the volume you'll
still be able to see what's going on
which is not the case on the iPhone 22
more ergonomic with this curvier edges
convenient button placement and smaller
overall footprint the Google pixel is a
bit more comfortable to hold in the hand
23 better do not disturb on the iPhone
the Do Not Disturb mode is limited to
just one preset schedule on the pixel
excel you can set different schedules
for weekdays and weekends
have do not disturb turn on
automatically during certain calendar
events and even decide whether or not
your notifications turn on your screen
24 on device support if you ever run
into issues on the pixel you have a
support menu right in the settings where
you can talk to a real person right then
and there 24/7 and if you want you can
even have the tech support
representative actually control your
phone to help solve the issue for you
and finally reason number 25 headphone
jack yeah so I can't believe I'm saying
this but unlike the iPhone 7 plus the
pixel excel has a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack so you don't have to
replace your old headphones or carry
around an adapter alright now that
you've heard the 25 reasons why the
pixel can be considered better click
here or on the link down below in the
description to see why the iPhone can be
considered better and then after
watching both videos let me know which
phone you think has a stronger reasons
in the comment section below I'd love to
hear what you guys think but anyways
that is it for me in this video thank
you guys for watching and as always I'll
see you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
