today i'ma show you how to get album art
on your Google music app on Ice Cream
Sandwich so go ahead and open up my
music up right now to show you that most
of my albums don't have album art it
just has that little default picture
that I assume sandwich has for your
music i'ma hit home and I'll show you
how to get your album art in here so the
first thing you're gonna need to do is
get an album art grabber or something
like that from the Android Market I got
this album art gab right here for free
and I had it running in the background
before I started this video so it has a
couple of my album arts I already
grabbed so I'm just going to go ahead
and go to the next step it's not
finished so I'd recommend waiting for
this to finish um you can see is right
now is 63 at 178 so I don't feel like
waiting the whole time so I can show you
how to do it so what you're going to do
is you're going to go to the settings
and you can go to applications and from
applications go under all because we're
trying to get the Google Music app which
is the system app so it's under all
we're going to go scroll down to music
and up from here what you're going to do
is clear data so when you do this it's
going to clear out everything in your
Google music app so that way when you
reopen it it's going to rescan your your
device and it will find the songs or the
albums with the album art embedded so
make clear data hit okay hit home and
I'll go to Google music and that's going
to take a while for it to scan my phone
but once it does you'll see that at
least the album's that have grabbed so
far will be added into the Google Music
app so let's see if it loaded up yet I
don't want to do that right now
there you go so you can see some of the
ones that I've already grabbed have now
been added in to my phone so if of
course I waited the whole time all of
these would have been filled out alright
that's pretty much it this is david

video and don't forget to visit Bombo
