go to be doing a review on the HTC Sense
for user interface found on the HTC One
series like the 1x the 1s in this case
the evo 4g LTE variant from sprint what
that says go ahead and get right into
the review first thing I look out out
and sense is the home screen so right
now I have five home screens on my phone
of course but I wanted more i can just
pinch out and hit add panel just like
that of course if i don't want seven
panels which is the maximum i guess
press and hold on them and remove it
just like that so pretty cool ability to
customize your home screen slick that i
could actually get it down all the way
to one if I really wanted so that's that
with the home screen the next thing I
want to show you is the app launcher so
of course first you have this app talk
right here which is customizable and
these icons actually show up on your
lock screen which I'll get into in just
a second but let's go ahead and look at
the app launcher so your apps are not
scrolling up and down anymore side to
side just like ICS and you have all your
page right here if you want to look at
the top apps that you use most often you
hit this frequent tab and these are the
apps that I use most often so I have
five apps going down and four across so
that's 20 apps in total most of the time
this will be you know the page where
you'll find app so you most commonly use
if you go to downloads these are the
apps that I've download myself from the
google play store and you have a little
Play Store icon right over here which is
a nice little shortcut so if we're
trying to get to a place where instead
of having to look for it or make it
separates work on the home screen use
tap on the sky and get right into it to
download whatever you want so that's the
app launcher what's really cool about
the app launcher is you have this little
cube effect which is pretty much
consistent throughout the whole UI and
I'll show you that within I each section
but not only kid you I do this little
cube animation but you can also edit
these tabs right here at the bottom so
say for example you know what I don't
really care to see this downloads tab
I've actually just press and hold on it
so press and hold and it says press and
hold I concert arranged so see I didn't
want this over here I could just delete
it like that and say I just wanted my
frequent tab to be first I could do it
like that as well so at home and all of
a sudden my
I launcher it has been customized to
exactly i want it i want the apps that I
use most often right then there and then
all my apps over here so of course you
know you don't have to do this but it's
an option that you do have let's go
ahead and take a look at the settings
though so I'll go ahead and hit settings
now you'll notice right away that the
settings look different from your
typical ICS device it's white background
and you know all the icons have been
customized by HTC also you have this
little cool scrolling animation which
definitely gives it a nice little look
you know it's a little bit more polished
you know basically the wherever you
scroll from is however many tabs it
makes i'm going to show you the personal
type tab premier so the personalized tab
is where you're going to customize a lot
of things on your phone just like that
your name implies so you have scenes on
the sense UI which is basically a
homescreen arrangement so as you get
remember I don't have anything on my
home screens other than that one page
with the clock widget I'll go ahead and
select Sprint's Steen right here so your
HTC device may or may not have this but
you get the idea I mean you're gonna
have something similar so you see my
home screen looks a little bit different
the background is different and I have
these widgets are already pre-loaded on
my home screen so pretty cool to have
you know scenes like that and you can
actually customize these scenes and
change them that way you know if you're
at work you can put your work seen on if
you're at on vacation Capri applications
teen on and so forth so for example this
is the work one if I wanted you know all
my productivity widgets and whatnot all
my homescreen I could do so so that's
definitely a cool functionality that HTC
Sense offers you you know not not many
other you either anything I don't think
any UI is offer you that same
functionality you could also change the
skins so the cooling what sense compared
to other UI is it really gives you the
ability to customize your phone to
exactly want almost to the level of
having a custom rom I mean maybe I'm
exaggerating a little but for example
right now my lockscreen i'll go ahead
and show you that looks like this so i
unlock it you know this background
whatnot and the little ring with silver
if i go over to the personalized tab and
go over to the skin let's say I like the
map back black look so this is the HTC
evo 4g LTE you know has that matte black
back cover so why not make
a soccer match I'm going to choose this
matte black look I'm going to tap apply
and it does take a second because it's
changing pretty much everything on the
phone so it has to reload a lot of the
UI and there you go even my clock widget
is not black of course my notification
bar is matte black like my little app
dock is matte black and let's go ahead
and look at the lock screen and you know
more of the same matte black so it's a
really cool way to kind of theme your
phone to whatever you want you can do
like a purple theme go ahead and show
you what they have really quick so they
have this Matt one that I have that this
orange is orange ish one right here
called fractured they have one called
infinite which has a green hue with the
dark gray they have serene aluminum
which makes everything look nice and
shiny and then this typical HTC One go
ahead and black back out of here another
thing I want to talk about sense is the
amount of wallpapers that come so if we
hit on HTC wallpapers unlike other
phones are other manufacturer you eyes
HTC loads a whole bunch of custom
wallpapers on here i made heart you just
have a bunch to choose from and a lot of
more you know really really nice you
know i have really really good quality
and for example if I wanted to choose
let me see I get picky when I have too
many options let's let's just choose
this little waterfall right here
actually we'll choose yeah which is this
so we'll choose this hit apply and there
you see I changed my background like
that and you know it's really nice to
have a little bit of options obviously
can download an app for that but I just
like the fact that they included
speaking of you know things that they
include widgets is another thing so to
add a widget is press and holding the
home screen and honestly there are so
many widgets that come with sense it's
crazy I mean other phones come with like
maybe 12 pages of widgets you see down
here it says 24 so you have 24 pages
worth of widgets and a lot of them were
done by HTC then you can kind of scroll
through so yup all these clocks you have
you know some apps that i download it
myself but most of them you know come
sloggin phone and also more from HTC all
these little toggles that you have I
mean really nice because it gives you
control over things that you normally
wouldn't
applications on market are just a google
play store you know don't necessarily
match the theme of your phone where of
course these ones look like just
everything else so you'd actually
customize our categorize what you're
looking at so for example if you want to
see widgets that you know we're just
from just for messaging you can tap on
it and see the messaging which is down
here so pretty cool of course we have
that same little cube effect here so we
can add apps and shortcuts if we wanted
but that's why I want to show you there
as far as the the wide variety of
widgets you could choose from another
thing is the browser so let's quick take
a quick look at the browser so let's go
ahead and load up phone book calm really
quick so foam buff calm and i want to
show you this cool feature that the HTC
Sense browser has that I haven't seen on
other Android browsers just yet I have
seen on the iPhones browser it's the
read feature so for example let's say
I'm reading this article the HTC One X
versus the samsung galaxy s3 loading it
up really quick and you know this is the
bumbo website you have to go through
some links you know you have some menu
options and things like that and maybe I
don't want to get that I just want to
read the article of course there's
advertisements and things like that so a
good way to get out of all that is you
just hit this little re feature right
over here you tap read and just like the
iphone it takes all that other stuff
away and you have nothing but the
article and it's a really really nice no
way to read things on your phone and
with the screen this big you know you're
going to be doing that a lot so if
you're in New York Times you're on you
know Huffington Post or whatever you
wherever you go for your news or
articles you can be able to read it you
know with just the text without having
to worry about ads and things like that
of course if you want to go back to fall
you just tap for like that so anyway
that's another feature that I like on
the UI another thing is the camera and
you know I have to talk about the camera
I've talked about it in the review when
I did it on this phone I did on the
review on the HTC One S but i have to do
again here because the camera you are
here is really nice you know one is the
ability to take burst shots like that so
I know phones like the galaxy s3 has the
same variety but it's not as you know
easy as I mean you have to hit menu
then turn it on and then do it this one
you can do it right then in there if you
want take one picture do it like that
going to take burst just press and hold
it if you want to record a video you
could just press this video button and
boom you're recording a video so really
cool that you can do all that right then
there of course you have all these
customization options right here for all
these different effects that you can
apply if you want more you can just tap
on settings and you know these are all
the options that you have over here and
if you tap on this affects page you have
the HDR panorama mode portrait landscape
whiteboard all these little effect so
let's go ahead and turn my whiteboard
and you can see this makes it a lot
brighter and let's do uh you know what
let's do uh I'll show you a slow-motion
video really quick so you can see that
the video recording icon has a guy
running in slow motion I could you know
this tap on this I'll just knock this
guy over and maybe just pull them around
like that stop recording the video let's
go ahead and watch it this should show
you how it looks force it doesn't record
audio but I think it's a pretty cool
feature just to be able to watch things
in slow motion I mean really cool of
course you wanted to speed it up you
just tap on this and I get the sped up
motion based off what you want anyway
that is the camera app which I
definitely like on the sense UI and the
last thing I just want to talk about is
the general you I man I kind of already
made inventions of it as far as the this
whole cube 3d effect that it has which
is nice but the UI is part the way the
UI looks probably my favorite features
about cents compared to the other you
guys out there I just feel like it just
looks the cleanest you'll not only do
you have all those options to customize
it and make it in matte black for
example like I did but when you tap on
for example the weather widget or the
clock widget your world clock has a nice
3d globe you know little things like
that that just make you feel like it's
higher end you know your timer and
stopwatch are beautiful here's your
alarm let's go ahead and look at the
weather for example so tap on weather
and you get this nice little weather
forecast right here I could go to hourly
and see a little graph as far as how the
weather is changing over time
get a four-day forecast get weather news
if i want i still have that 3d cube
effect going on I wanted to look at a
different time zone I let's go ahead and
do it I wanted to do this little
animation so let's see if I could get so
you see it's just through animations see
the clouds moving you could tap on it
once to get a full screen view just
really nice way to interact with your
weather app so anyway that is the
weather app course like i said it's
customizable so i'm going to show you a
little bit more as far as how these tabs
are customizable so this is my phone app
you know you have your groups call
history people and that they're all you
know have the cube but for example i say
i don't know i don't you ever use groups
on my phone so i'm just going to press
and hold on it it's okay there you go it
gets me into edit mode then i present
hold on it move it out of the way you
know what I don't really like I want
people over here I can do like that
reorder to exactly I want and that's why
I'm saying like you really have the
ability to customize your phone to
exactly how you want with the sense UI
but anyway that's pretty much it on
these sense user interfaces HTC Sense
for um I really do like it I know this
video went on for pretty long but I just
wanted to give you guys you know an
in-depth look as far as the things I
like there's a bunch of things that
obviously that you know I didn't cover
check out the video i did comparing the
sense UI to the TouchWiz UI on the
galaxy s3 that might give you you know
some of the things that I didn't cover
in this video but anyway that's it for
me in this video if you found it helpful
please hit the like button helps me out
a lot and subscribe to the channel thank
