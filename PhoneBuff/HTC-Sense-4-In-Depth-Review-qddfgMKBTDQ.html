gonna be doing a review on the HTC Sense
for user interface found on the HTC One
series like the One X the one s in this
case the Evo 4G LTE variant from Sprint
but what that says go ahead and get
right into the review first thing I look
out out and cents is the home screen so
right now I have five home screens on my
phone of course but I wanted more I can
just pinch out and hit add panel just
like that of course if I don't want
seven panels which is the maximum I
guess press and hold on them and remove
it just like that so pretty cool ability
to customize your home screen just like
that I could actually get it down all
the way to one if I really wanted so
that's that with the home screen the
next thing I want to show you is the app
launcher so of course first you have
this app dock right here which is
customizable and these icons actually
show up on your lock screen which I'll
get into in just a second but let's go
ahead and look at the app launcher so
your apps are not scrolling up and down
anymore side to side just like ICS and
you have all your pages right here if
you want to look at the top apps that
you use most often you hit this frequent
tab and these are the apps that I use
most often so I have five apps going
down and four across so that's 20 apps
in total most of the time this will be
you know the page where you'll find apps
that you most commonly use if you go to
downloads these are the apps that I've
downloaded myself from the Google Play
Store and you have a little Play Store
icon right over here which is a nice
little shortcut so we're trying to get
to a place where instead of having to
look for it or make a separate work on
the home screen you just tap on the sky
and get right into it to download
whatever you want so that's the app
launcher what's really cool about the
app launcher is you have this little
cube effect which is pretty much
consistent throughout the whole UI and
I'll you know show you that within each
section but not only could you do this
little cube animation but you could also
edit these tabs right here at the bottom
so say for example you know what I don't
really care to see this downloads tab
I've actually just press and hold on it
so press and hold and it says press and
hold I constantly range so see I didn't
want this over here I could just delete
it like that and I say I just wanted my
frequent tab to be first I could do it
like that as well so at home and all of
a sudden my
launcher it has been customized to
exactly I want it I want the apps that I
use most often right then there and then
all my apps will be here so of course
you know you don't have to do this but
it's an option that you do have let's go
ahead and take a look at these settings
though so I'll go ahead and hit settings
now you'll notice right away that the
settings look different from your
typical ICS device it's white background
and you know all the icons have been
customized by HTC also you have this
little cool scrolling animation which
definitely gives it a nice little look
you know it's a little bit more polished
you know basically the wherever you
scroll from is however many tabs it
makes I'm going to show you the personal
type tab premiere so the personalized
tab is where you're gonna customize a
lot of things on your phone just like
that your name implie so you have scenes
on the Sense UI which is basically a
home screen arrangement so as you get
remember I don't have anything on my
home screens other than that one page
with the clock widget I'll go ahead and
select Sprint's steen right here so your
HTC device may or may not have this but
you get the idea I mean you're gonna
have something similar so you see my
home screen looks a little bit different
the background is different and I have
these widgets are already pre-loaded on
my home screen so pretty cool to have
you know scenes like that and you can
actually customize these scenes and
change them that way you know if you're
at work you could put your work scene on
if you're at on vacation Capri
application scene on and so forth so for
example this is the work one if I wanted
you know all my productivity widgets and
whatnot all my homescreen I could do so
so that's definitely a cool
functionality that HTC Sense offers you
you know not not many other you either I
don't think any UI is offer you that
same functionality you could also change
the skins so the cooling what sense
compared to other UI is it really gives
you the ability to customize your phone
to exactly you want almost to the level
of having a custom ROM I mean maybe I'm
exaggerating a little but for example
right now my lock screen I'll go ahead
and show you that looks like this
so I unlock it you know this background
whatnot and the little ring was silver
if I go over to the personalized tab and
go over to the skin let's say I like the
matte back black look so this is the HTC
EVO 4G LTE you know it has that matte
black back cover so why not make
salamat I'm going to choose this matte
black look I'm gonna tap apply and it
does take a second because it's changing
pretty much everything on the phone so
it has to reload a lot of the UI and
there you go even my clock widget is not
black of course my notification bar is
not black like my little app dock is
matte black and let's go ahead and look
at the lockscreen and you know more of
the same matte black so it's a really
cool way to kind of theme your phone to
whatever you want you can do like a
purple theme go ahead and show you what
they have really quick so they have this
matte one that I have they have this
orange is orange ish one right here
called fractured they have one called
infinite which has a green hue with the
dark gray they have serene aluminum
which makes everything look nice and
shiny and then this typical HTC one go
ahead and black back out of here
another thing I wanted to talk about
cents is the amount of wallpapers that
come so if you hit on HTC wallpapers
unlike other phones or other
manufacturer UIs HTC loads a whole bunch
of custom wallpapers on here I mean hurt
you just have a bunch to choose from and
a lot of more you know really really
nice you know I have really really good
quality and for example if I wanted to
choose let me see I get picked when I
have too many options this lets us
choose this little waterfall right here
actually will choose yeah which is this
so we'll choose this hit apply and there
you see I changed my background like
that and you know it's really nice to
have a little bit of options obviously
can download an app for that but I just
like the fact that they included
speaking of you know things that they
include widgets is another thing so to
add a widget is press and holding the
home screen and honestly there are so
many widgets that come with sense it's
crazy I mean other phones come with like
maybe 12 pages of widgets you see down
here it says 24 so you have 24 pages
worth of widgets and a lot of them were
done by HTC then you can kind of scroll
through so yup all these clocks you have
you know some apps that I downloaded
myself but most of them you know come
sloggin phone and also more from HTC all
these little toggles that you have I
mean really nice because it gives you
control over things that you normally
wouldn't may
be applications the market harshest say
Google Playstore you know don't
necessarily match the theme of your
phone where of course these ones look
like just everything else so you'd
actually customize our categorize what
you're looking at so for example if you
want to see widgets that you know we're
just from just for message and you could
tap on it and see the messaging it
we're just on here so pretty cool of
course we have that same little cube
effect here so we can add apps and
shortcuts if we wanted but that's what I
want to show you there as far as the the
wide variety of widgets you could choose
from another thing is the browser so
let's quick take a quick look at the
browser so let's go ahead and load up
phonebook calm really quick so phone
buff calm and I want to show you this
cool feature that the HD sense browser
has that I haven't seen on other Android
browsers just yet I have seen on the
iPhones browsing it's the read feature
so for example let's say I'm reading
this article the HTC One X versus the
Samsung Galaxy s3 loading it up really
quick and you know this is a bumboat
website you have to go through some
links you know you have some menu
options and things like that and maybe I
don't want to get that I just want to
read the article of course there's
advertisements and things like that so a
good way to get out of all that is you
just hit this little reef feature right
over here you tap read and just like the
iPhone it takes all that other stuff
away and you have nothing but the
article and it's a really really nice no
way to read things on your phone and
with the screen this big you know you're
gonna be doing that a lot so if you're
in New York Times you're on
you know Huffington Post or whatever you
wherever you go for your news or
articles you're gonna be able to read it
you know with just the text without
having to worry about ads and things
like that of course if you want to go
back to four you just tap fall like that
so anyway that's another feature that I
like on the UI another thing is the
camera and you know I have to talk about
the camera I've talked about it in the
review when I did it on this phone I did
on the review on the HTC One S but I
have to do it again here because the
camera you are in here is really nice
you know one is the ability to take
burst shots like that so I know phones
like the galaxy s3 has the same variety
but it's not as you know easy as I mean
you have to hit a menu setting and then
turn it on and then do it this one
you do it right then in there if you
wanna take one picture do it like that
come on take burst please press and hold
it if you want to record a video you
could just press this video button and
boom you're recording a video so really
cool that you can do all that right then
there of course you have all these
customization options right here for all
these different effects that you could
apply if you want more you could just
tap on settings and you know these are
all the options that you have over here
and if you tap on this effects page you
have the HDR panorama mode portrait
landscape whiteboard all these little
effects so let's go ahead and turn on
whiteboard and you can see this makes it
a lot brighter and let's do uh you know
what let's do I don't know I'll show you
a slow-motion video really quick so you
can see that the video recording icon
has a guy running in slow motion I could
you know this tap on this I'll just
knock this guy over and maybe just pull
them around like that stop recording the
video and let's go ahead and watch it
this should show you how it looks
of course it doesn't record audio but I
think it's a pretty cool feature just to
be able to watch things in slow motion I
mean really cool of course you wanted to
speed it up you just tap on this and I
get the sped up motion based off what
you want anyway that is the camera app
which I definitely like on the Sense UI
and last thing I just want to talk about
is the general UI man I kind of already
made inventions of it as far as the this
whole cube 3d effect that it has which
is nice but the UI is powered the way
the UI looks the probably my favorite
features about cents compared to the
other UI is out there I just feel like
it just looks the cleanest you're not
only do you have all those options to
customize it and make it a matte black
for example like I did but when you tap
on for example the weather widget or the
clock widget your world clock has a nice
3d globe you know little things like
that that just make you feel like it's
higher in you know your timer and
stopwatch are beautiful here's your
alarm let's go ahead and look at the
weather for example so tap on weather
and you get this nice little weather
forecast right here I could go to hourly
and see a little graph as far as how the
weather is changing over time get a
four-day forecast get weather news
I still have that 3d cube effect going
on if I wanted to look at a different
time zone let's go ahead and do I wanted
to do this through animation so let's
see if I could get so you can see it's
just through animations see the clouds
moving you could tap on it once to get a
full screen view just really nice way to
interact with your weather app so anyway
that is the weather app of course like I
said it's customizable so I'm going to
show you a little bit more as far as how
these tabs are customizable so this is
my phone app you know you have your
groups call history people and that
they're all you know have the cube but
for example let's say I don't know I
don't you ever use groups on my phone so
I'm just gonna press and hold on it ok
there you go it gets me into edit mode
then I present hold on it move it out of
the way you know what I don't really
like I want people over here I can do it
like that reorder to exactly I want and
that's why I'm saying like you really
have the ability to customize your phone
to exactly how you want with the SNC why
but anyway that's pretty much it on
these sense user interfaces HTC Sense 4
I really do like it I know this video
went on for pretty long but I just
wanted to give you guys you know an
in-depth look as far as the things that
like there's a bunch of things that
obviously that you know I didn't cover
check out the video I did comparing the
Sense UI to the TouchWiz UI on the
galaxy s3 that might give you you know
some of the things that I didn't cover
in this video but anyway that's it for
me in this video if you found it helpful
please hit the like button it helps me
out a lot and subscribe to the channel
