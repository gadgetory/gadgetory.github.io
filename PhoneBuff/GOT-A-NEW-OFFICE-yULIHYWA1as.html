while since i posted a new video and a
lot of guys been asked me on facebook on
Twitter and here on YouTube where the
hell have been and it's actually a
two-part answer number one early last
month I was sick I don't know if it was
due to all that Halloween can hear what
but it did send me back about a week or
so and then number two and the main
reason why I haven't been able to post a
new video is I'm busy finding and moving
into a new office space which I finally
got so I post it on Twitter if you guys
were interested in seeing it a lot of
you guys said yes so in this video we're
gonna be checking out the new space but
not just that I'm not just be throwing
you the new space but also a lot of the
equipment I use since I've never really
done a desk tour or a gear tour other
than the one I did at CES last year
which was just my travel stuff so anyway
in this video I'm gonna show you some of
the equipment I use to make the videos
here you see on youtube but before I go
into that I want to show you guys what I
plan on bringing to you in the next
video guys ready it's the Nexus 6 so on
instagram i posted a picture of this guy
ask you guys a guess we're interested in
a speed test obviously you guys are but
i want to know here in the video are in
the comments down below what bones would
you guys like to see this pit against I
mean I'm gonna do it against the note 4
since that one the last be test and
probably the iphone 6 since that one
seems to be faster than the six plus and
also beat the heck out of the galaxy s5
and marginally by the HTC One m8 so
those three phones are already
slaughtered in but I'm thinking about
introducing maybe another phone I don't
know if you guys be interested in maybe
three is enough let me know I have this
guy over here which agency sent out to
me the Moto X new one so i don't know if
you guys want to see that in the speed
test maybe another phone let me know
down below in the comments and I'll see
what I can do to see if we get in if not
we'll just do those three that I
mentioned before but anyways let's go
ahead and check out the office space
you're ready all right let's check it
out
alright so welcome to the new fomba
office over here you got the desk that I
was just a second ago you see I've got
my camera mounted right here from the
best this is a canon 70d i'm using right
now and i've been using it on the
channel for a while now but i am
actually gonna be shipping it out
getting a new one soon that i'm super
excited about but for the meantime this
is going to be my camera got a lighting
kit over here you have a microphone it's
the sennheiser MK h 4 16 a lot of all
the model numbers memorized for all the
gear that i have so i've been making a
list down below in the description you
guys are interested check it out anyways
see on this desk get this recorder so
the mic hooks up into the recorder works
a lot better than the internal hams do
on the camera and gives you that crisp
and clear sound quality that you used to
get in here the channel over here in the
corner you can see we've got some
acoustic foam helps absorb some of that
echo back right now there probably isn't
all that much echo when I first moved in
there's a bunch of echo so I think
they're helping I call this area station
8 the reason why i like to call
stationing is mainly so they call this
PlayStation be because this is what I do
all the b-roll I I did a speedtest here
I do the 25 reasons village all that
good stuff and what I like about this
new office space is a lot bigger than my
last one was I mean this place isn't
really all that big to begin with lots
of was a lot smaller but having this
extra space allows me to have one set
you know configured without having to
change the lights every second like I
would before so I have station eight of
them ready I just go in front of it
shoot record I'm good over here same
thing underneath I've got this slider so
this is the Kessler stealth this thing
gets super super smooth slides and I've
got a manfrotto ahead on here the same
one that I have on my tripod but down
there more acoustic foam and this is
where here i'm going to show you this
little mini kitchen / coffee bar so
we've got a microwave cuz man's got to
eat got a little mini fridge nothing
really in there but some cold ones right
now always a good thing to have got a
sink oh like to have this guy over here
so this is a 3d model of the human brain
something that I'm really into outside
of tech so I've actually sees my main
passion outside of technologies
neuroscience yeah recognize this this is
from the job tests which by the way has
over 11 million views right now which is
insane this thing was to level off the
drops interesting over here this secret
room this is where a lot of business
gets conducted just kidding it's the
bathroom but what's weird about the
bathroom is normally a bachelor an
office-based but you don't have a shower
so I don't know if I'm ever gonna use it
guess it's nice to have just the case I
feel dirty performing in the video but
moving on we're going to go over here
and check out what all the magic happens
this is the desk that you guys probably
seen actually my older videos so up top
I've got this 4k monitor by del it's the
I don't know the model number check the
description again but it's the ultra
sharp so it's not that cheaper want that
you've seen on it cyber monday deals but
it is really good it has a really good
color accuracy really sharp image yet
logitech wireless keyboard and mouse and
now this one actually a little like
solar panels so I never have to charge
it which is dope just press this little
button you can see this little happy
face right here means that I'm getting
energy from the lights above when the
sad face is on flashes red no good
right here got a little headphone stand
so i can keep my desk looking nice and
clean got some headphones so these are
the bose around the ear too I used to
have audio technica headphones and while
they produced really good sound quality
the value is great even though this is
both on a lot of guys like all boses
over rated and overpriced these are the
most comfortable headphones that I've
actually personally tested considering
that I don't have any other speakers
connected and I wear it all the time
when I'm using my computer I need
something that's comfortable move it
along we got some Android figures which
has become addicted to collecting
unfortunately the little antlers keep
breaking off so I have to keep buying
new ones that some phones right here
microfibers pretty much everywhere
throughout the office and this is
something actually as special to me this
is a little plaque that YouTube said to
me for surpassing 100,000 subscribers
which is thanks to you guys and now you
guys have seen this in a couple of other
youtubers channels in I post a picture
of this on my Instagram and just once
again I want to say thank you guys
because you guys make it all possible
we've got to find a special spot to hang
it up haven't figured out yet over here
in the corner is a more acoustic foam
that's a special and a filing cabinets
printer this regular office stationery
Oh youtube also sent this out this will
stool with that plaxo kind of small I
know if I could sit on it but if
somebody comes in I want to sit here and
grab that chair they've got a seat
anyways moving along we've got a boom
pole so this thing is the I use this
with a see Mike that I bent over there
on that meat station a desk i plug the
mic in here swing it over to my desktop
I'm able to do voice-overs for those ski
tests and other videos that I do this
thing I actually have had this for a
while haven't been able to use it a lot
because the old ox base again
was a lot smaller this one's bigger so
I'm able to bring it in move it around
when I need to but it's a gym so you can
just kind of put the camera on here its
wings up and down nice and smooth and it
goes up to like 12 feet so if i use it
outdoors you get some really nice shots
we're just some plastic container
holding your regular office supplies the
more aggressive bone up there in the
order to help absorb that echo and up
that is pretty much it for the office
space out here you have your entry or
exit whatever want to call it and what's
cool is this spot is kind of secluded in
to its own so like I don't have any
direct neighbor with the people in
offices in different buildings but this
building is kind of stand alone in my
own downstairs I've got some storage
which it's too boring to show you guys
but other than that that is pretty much
it again let me know which phone you
guys I'm going to see or which phone is
you guys want to see pit against key
Nexus 6 and a speed test that is most
likely be run up my next video unless I
do something else but for the most part
that's what I'm thinking but other than
that thank you guys for watching and as
always I'll see you guys in the very
next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
