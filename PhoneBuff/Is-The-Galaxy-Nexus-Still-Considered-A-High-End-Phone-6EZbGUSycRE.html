this video we're talking about the
Samsung Galaxy Nexus and answering some
questions you guys have had about the
device are mainly is two questions I
want to talk about one you guys been
asking is a Galaxy Nexus still
considered a high in phone and two if it
is is it worth buying at this point in
time and now those are two good
questions to answer the first one you
have to compare the Galaxy Nexus to some
of the other high-end phones out there
in the market being the galaxy s3 which
is yet to drop but once it does
definitely be one the best available on
Android diving for us obviously the best
available on iOS and the Nokia Lumia 900
is one of the best available on Windows
Phone so how does the Galaxy Nexus stack
up well let's look at it the screen on
the Galaxy Nexus is four point six five
inches Super AMOLED 1280 by 720 p and
resolution giving you a ppi which stands
for pixels per inch basically the more
pixels per inch to clear the screen of
316 and the only phone out of the three
are compared to the Galaxy Nexus that
beats it is the iphone 4s which is 326
ppi and that's mainly due to the smaller
screen size on the iphone 4 f is 3.5
even though the resolution is 960 x 640
so overall I thought to say the Galaxy
Nexus is one of the better screens you
know everyone has the purposes some
people like smaller screens of people
like bigger screens like my galaxy s3
which has the same resolution but it's
bigger so the PPI is a little bit less
but you know I really like the screen
size in here I love the PPI um how to
say it's one of my favorite screens um I
haven't tried the galaxy s3 screen just
yet but out of the other two I do like
the one on here more courses personal
preference but anyway definitely
competes for a high-end foam so the next
thing we're talk about the processor the
processor is something that I've
complained about in the past about the
Galaxy Nexus it's not the i key notes uh
the dual core one it's not the s
Snapdragon s4 it's a TI OMAP for 460 but
for my speed comparison tests that I've
done with phones like the HTC One S with
ones like the iphone 4s it does compete
it is close it does get aided out a
little bit it you know can compete more
or less with the iphone 4s the HTC One
does kind of blow this guy out of the
water out of the water wouldn't say that
but the galaxy s3 definitely would
bullets got out of the water um and of
course the Nokia Lumia 900 only has a
1.4 year single core processor but
Windows Phone was just so fast the West
that it just makes up for that so I'll
have to say the processor it's kind of
like okay but I still say its high-end
um the next thing is the ram obviously
with the gig of ram it has more than
both the iphone 4s and the nokia lumia
900 and ties the galaxy s3 so high-end
in that regard the one thing for sure i
could say that isn't high end on the
Galaxy Nexus is the camera on the back
it's only five megapixels and you know I
got a lot of criticism when I first came
out nowadays you know with new phones
coming out with the One X and the galaxy
s3 is definitely going to be considered
uh you know not high grade in that
regard um it the camera is good I mean I
use it you know a lot and it does take
decent shots but it's just not as good
as the Nokia Lumia it's not as good for
us it's close you know I compared on
phone go com you guys want to check that
out but it's just not as good um I'd
have the same I haven't tried the s3
obviously but once i do i'm pretty sure
it's gonna you know perform better than
this guy considering that the s2 did the
next thing i want to talk about is like
certain features like bluetooth and NFC
this guy has NFC so does s3 die before
us and the Nokia Lumia 900 do not so
that's something to consider I see I'd
say that makes a high end because NFC is
definitely a new technology and high-end
phones typically have the new technology
Bluetooth the s3 and I forest at four
point oh this guy is three point 0 then
Lumia 900 has 2.1 so it's gotta it blows
right between those two categories so
I'd say it's still high in that regard
overall I mean I'd say yeah it is a
higher form the camera being the one
thing but remember the front facing
camera is still 1.3 mega missiles
capable of 720p so it is a high-end
front camera if that means anything to
and the next thing we talk about is is
the goggles nice is worth buying I mean
at three hundred nine dollars unlocked
from google for the hspa+ version which
I have right here that's definitely a
steal it just came out on sprint and you
know it's been on verizon obviously but
is it worth buying at this point I mean
should you wait for the galaxy s3
and honestly the answer really comes
down to a software i mean you know what
the Galaxy Nexus are going to get a pure
Android experience with an HTC like 1x
you're going to have to deal with sense
for the better or worse same thing with
the galaxy s3 but you know a lot of
those you guys add some value that the
stock ICS doesn't but of course you know
you're going to get updated faster on
the Galaxy Nexus than you are on those
other guys and with Andrew porno of
being able to disable apps kind of makes
up for the difference but um I'll say I
mean if you don't have if you're not a
prett in a contract on a gsm carrier
like AT&amp;amp;T or t-mobile I'll take a strong
look at the galaxy Ness because I've
worn indoors at full retail value
unlocked without a contract it's
definitely worth it um I'll really
consider if you're on attr on verizon
and sprint should I say um maybe I'll
take a look at I would take a look at
the HTC One X personally or on the
sprint is called the evo and I I might
just wait for the galaxy s3 power you
guys but if you're looking for a phone
right now you know like this month I'll
still take a look at the Galaxy Nexus if
you're an AT&amp;amp;T or Sprint take a look at
the evo or the 1x whatever your carrier
calls it but I if you're on t-mobile I
still think this is one of the better
devices I did a review on the 1's the
one that's definitely really nice but it
doesn't compete with the screen size it
doesn't have NFC so some of those
features are missing it does have a
better processor that s4 but anyway
hopefully this video gives you a better
idea as far as you know if you're gonna
get the Galaxy Nexus if you haven't got
one already or if you're gonna get the
galaxy s3 I mean I might not give the
galaxy s3 because I'm not that impressed
with it I don't know I usually end up
getting new phones and i see i see i'm
not gonna get it but I end up getting it
anyway I end up budging but anyways not
super impressed other than the processor
but the u.s. processor is going to be s4
so I don't know if imma get the galaxy
s3 anyways hope is good it helps you um
