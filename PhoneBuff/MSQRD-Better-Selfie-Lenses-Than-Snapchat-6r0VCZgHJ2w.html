the very first episode of a per crap
where we take a look at random apps that
we come across and share our opinions of
it with you guys in today's episode
we're gonna be taking a look at an app
called msqrd which uses facial
recognition like snapchat and Facebook
to to put a mask on you in real time so
with that said let's go ahead and check
out what this thing can do alright so
let's go ahead and fire the app up and
as you can see you're greeted with the
first mask you could say and kind of
looks like Sailor Moon I don't know if
you guys remember that cartoon I use the
watch it goes out a bigger sister going
up I think I'll skip on that face mask
we'll go over to Iron Man so shake your
head down shake my head down I am oh
shoot there you go oh that is dope so
you can see you can move your head
around and it does a pretty good job at
tracking you in fact I can move around
like this look left oh there you go so
because he jumped off a little bit oh oh
hello there oh this is for two faces
we're going to skip that for now and now
we're Snoop Dogg so oh that is freaking
dope see like you don't even need to do
makeup anymore like most people will do
will put makeup on and like take a
selfie now you don't need to do it you
have this app and it looks pretty damn
legit that looks real I can't wait to
see what its gonna look like putting
that camera with all these damn silly
face it without these masks on got a
monkey face alright party mode Oh
shouldn't drop our phones drop ties
coming up a little bit later guys this
is an app review okay see this one this
one looks legit even the classes looks
like I'm really wearing them so yes okay
then come out of my mouth
oh I was like what zombie is that a
zombie that's a zombie it's got to be a
zombie oh you and the teeth if you take
a look at the teeth even my teeth at all
act up that is freaking dope this this
is part my favorite one so far now
obviously I'm just going through the
filters you can take pictures so I'll
take a picture and I'm gonna take it oh
here we go oh it's got to access my
photos there you go you can share it
straight to Twitter save it to your
phone
you could also obviously record videos
and this is what I really have use it
for I think it's a little bit longer
than snapchat gives you but that
freaking dope and you can see now it's
saving the video processing it it does
take a little bit of time there you go
this one's able to track my face pretty
much everywhere I go it's a a very
natural experience you can just use it
record and go and pull the most part
unless you turn your face like all the
ways are there so I mean that's a pretty
wide angle to be able to shoot out
without it messing up I look up look
down that's that's freaking impressive
man I I love this freaking half right
now boot base gotta love the poop base
do they have a lot of filters they have
a lot of them I'm scrolling through I
don't know how many they have but I feel
relaxed I feel like going to Hawaii
laying down on the beach I thought it's
cucumbers oh those look like Kiwis okay
see this look pretty cool I just love
look how quickly attract my face I can't
say it enough this is freaking
impressive the fact that you can just
move around however you want
be natural deliver your message send the
video to your friends and not have to
worry about it glitching out on you like
that
this is like I don't know who's like
drunk paced Hey
all right so the question is is msqrd an
app or is it crap
Leonardo says it's an app it's really
easy to use it's a bunch of fun and it's
got tons of filters that you can use
with celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio
which finally want an Oscar by the way
and yeah I like it
thumbs up for sure just like you should
give this video if you liked it
subscribe to the channel and as always
I'll see you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
