up guys david here and i've got any
different video for you guys today
because today we're gonna be taking a
look at a toaster
but not just any toaster we're gonna be
taking a look at a hot dog and hot dog
bun toaster you guys probably remember
this from the techie on a budget episode
we did right before christmas it's a hot
dog poster okay what'd you say that
pretty cool tank you want to get it this
is one of the five items that we
purchased for under 100 bucks and you're
just going crazy about it in the
comments you guys wanted a full review
so here we are not only we can be taking
a look but we're gonna be using it we
really testing it so up real quick we're
gonna take a look at the toaster itself
if you look at the top here he actually
has a little smiley face so that's
pretty dope uh this is we're gonna put
the actual hot dogs in hot dog buns go
right in here so you can do two at a
time and uh see right here it says retro
series pretty cool design if you ask me
I like the red on here the brand name is
nostalgia now I mean I get the retro
design behind it all but I don't know
what you I didn't have one of these
growing up so it doesn't bring back any
nostalgia for me the ringing is a solid
for you you didn't you know it does look
like the cars logo alright so we got the
buns in this is taking a lot longer than
I thought we gonna take hot dog bun no
hot dog
got the buns in got the hot dog Wiener
in the buns gonna go down oh no this is
not a sigh it's not a handle boy stop
abort fun thing go down get in their
buns all right yeah I hope it actually
pops up so we got the buns in we got the
hot dogs into the little basket and uh
we're gonna wait I know I said perfect
hot dogs every time I'm gonna have a
little faith I'm have a little faith
guys they're like intertwining with each
other the hot dogs yeah something weird
going on scared of all right buns
out I'm put this on the bag that's yours
dude oh it came with this little like
toms that are metal I kind of feel weird
about putting something metal in a
toaster hey I worked pretty well
actually I got some ketchup some mustard
that kind of water I know you don't eh
let's uh squeeze it I was a good hot dog
that my friends is it perfectly cooked
hot dog it lives up to his name I guess
I should be able to do it considering it
only does one thing you can't toast
bagels
you can't toast bread or at least you
know regular slices of bread all it does
is hot dogs it's the master of one it's
not a jack-of-all-trades it's the master
of one so overall I think this thing
cost like 25 we got it for 25 bucks 30
bucks
I'll put a link down below in the
description so you guys can check it out
if you are interested if you're
interested in being on the cutting edge
of the toaster game
it's it's it's decent guys so uh yeah
that is pretty much it for me and this
video if you guys liked even or see more
content like this give this video a big
thumbs up and uh as always I'll see you
in the very next episode and cut do hot
dogs first thing in the morning with
cold coffee though ah</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
