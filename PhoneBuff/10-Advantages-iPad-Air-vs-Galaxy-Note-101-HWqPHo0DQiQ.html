and when you look at the iPhone 5s in
the Galaxy Note 3 side-by-side you can
easily tell that there are two very
different devices targeted at different
groups of people but yet when you look
at the iPad air in the Galaxy Note 10.1
which are both kind of just bigger
screen versions of their smartphone
counterparts the difference between them
isn't anywhere near as glaring and
that's because with their tablets both
Apple and Samsung are targeting a more
similar demographic within that 10 inch
tablet space but that doesn't
necessarily mean that the tablets
themselves are any more similar to one
another than the smartphones because in
many ways the opposite is actually true
so in this video and in typical
phonebook fashion we're going to be
looking at 10 advantages that each of
these tablets has over the other and
hopefully by the end you'll have a much
better idea as to which tablet is the
best one for you let's go ahead and get
right into it alright so the first
advantage the iPad air has over the note
10.1 2014 edition is it's better overall
performance while the specialy would
have you believe that the note 10.1 is
beefy quad core processor and 3
gigabytes of RAM could easily I'll
perform the iPad Air's dual-core a7 chip
with this 1 gigabyte of RAM this isn't
really the case while actually in that
performance is similar on both tablets
switching in and out of those apps or
just navigating throughout the UI in
general is much smoother and much more
responsive on the iPad with the note
stuttering and lagging from time to time
but that doesn't mean the Note 10.1
high-end specs don't make a difference
in fact because it has three times the
amount of RAM the Note 10.1 first
advantage over the iPad is this
impressive multitasking ability which
allows you to use two three or even four
apps on the screen at the same time
which really takes advantage of the
extra screen real estate and can help
reduce how often you have to switch back
and forth between those abs in the first
place
- now speaking of apps while Android is
quickly catching up as of right now iOS
still has more tablet optimized apps
available which is a clear advantage for
the iPad air
Samson does counter with the demands of
its own which is the single biggest
thing that separates the note 10.1 from
the iPad or just about any other tablet
for that matter in the S Pen simply put
the S Pen is what makes the Note 10.1
live up to its name giving you the best
note-taking experience available on any
tablet 3 on the subject of living up to
its name the iPad air is significantly
lighter weight makes holding the tablet
for long periods of time whether you're
browsing the web or watching videos much
easier and less cramping on your hands
than on the note 10.1 now while the Note
10.1 can't really counter the iPads
lighter weight directly it does come
with the advantage of having an IR
blaster allowing you to control your TV
right from the tablet so you can
conveniently manage what you watch the
big screen for but the IR blaster is in
the note 10.1 s only multimedia
advantage it's higher resolution screen
with its 16 by 9 aspect ratio makes for
a better video experience in the notes
than on the iPad where the iPads 4:3
aspect ratio results in a bunch of
letterboxing that effectively turns that
nine point seven inch screen into a
smaller eight point seven screen which
needless to say isn't ideal for video
but not all is bad with the iPads aspect
ratio in fact the advantage of having a
4:3 ratio is that it makes for a better
and roomier portrait experience that's
great for browsing the web or using apps
and combined with more realistic colors
on the Retina display the iPad air
screen still offers a great overall
experience 5 since we're still talking
about it the other advantage the note
10.1 has in the multimedia Department is
its speakers now both the iPad air and
the note 10.1 have loud and great
sounding stereo speakers but because
both of the iPad speakers are located at
the bottom you don't really get that
stereo effect on the note 10.1 on the
other hand you do get the effect with a
speaker placed on each side which is
just a better smarter design but of
course when it comes to overall design
well that advantage goes to the iPad air
with its premium aluminum body with just
amazing attention to detail that the
note 10.1 is polycarbonate or plastic
body can't really match
six while your purchasing decision may
not and honestly should not be based off
the tablets camera I'm still going to
cover it here for you guys so when it
comes to the cameras the two tablets are
split the higher resolution 8 megapixel
rear camera with LED flash is an overall
better performer than the ISAT camera on
the back of the iPad mainly due to the
flash more than anything else but the
front-facing camera is a bit better on
the iPad despite having a slightly lower
resolution so it really comes down to if
you prefer taking selfies or taking
pictures in really low light where a
flash is handy
7 unlike smartphones tablets aren't as
personal of devices and often get shared
with friends and family so the seventh
advantage the Galaxy Note 10.1 has over
the iPad air is this support for
multiple user profiles similar to how
you can set up different accounts for
different people on a computer you can
do the same thing with the note 10.1
with each member of the family being
able to make their own little space with
their own wallpapers their own apps etc
keeping everyone's stuff separate and a
little bit more private now
while the iPad air can necessarily
directly counter this advantage at least
for right now it does have the advantage
of being able to be used by you your
friends and your family for a longer
period of time with its battery lasting
anywhere between one and three hours
longer depending on the type of usage 8
another advantage the iPad air has over
the note 10.1 is its tablet friendly
gestures want to quickly switch between
apps just swipe across the screen with
all five of your fingers want to return
to the home screen pinch those same five
fingers in want to go back a step
simply slide one finger across the
screen gestures like these can make
navigating the West just a little bit
faster and more convenient and is a
really nice feature to have of course
when it comes to features Samsung's
Galaxy Note has more than enough to
counter things like smart stay keep the
screen on as long as you're looking at
it end touch whizzes motion controls
offer a few gestures of its own like
taking a screenshot by simply swiping
your palm across the screen 9 you're in
and you're out the iPad is always a
popular choice among consumers and
because of that it has the advantage of
having a larger selection of accessories
available as more and more third-party
manufacturers
trying to cash in on the IFS market
share but in advantage the note 10.1 has
that just may cancel out some of those
third-party accessories is this OTG
support which allows you to easily
connect your own USB peripherals like a
keyboard or mouse with a simple OTG
cable that can cost less than $10 which
can potentially save you some good hard
cash on accessories 10 speaking of cash
the entry-level 16 gigabyte iPad air
will run you a cool $500 well the same
entry-level 16 gigabyte Galaxy Note 10.1
sells for 550 making the iPad air much
too many people surprised $50 cheaper
however the Note 10.1 does have an
advantage that can't make up for this
price difference in that it has an
expandable microSD card slot so if you
need more than just 16 gigabytes of
storage an additional 64 gigabytes will
cost you less than $50 in the note
whereas on the iPad going with the 64
gigabyte model will cost you an extra
$200 so it really does depend on your
storage needs
alright guys it's pretty much it for me
in this comparison at the end of the day
both of these tablets do a lot of the
same thing so if you're just looking to
go on Facebook browse the web and play
some games here and there you can't
really go wrong with either but because
these tablets are so different one of
them is most likely a better fit for you
than the other so hopefully this video
has helped you figure out which one that
is anyways if you found the video
helpful that like button is sitting down
below in maybe more importantly there's
also that subscribe button which will
ensure that you'll be among the first to
get more mobile technology videos from
me just like this thank you for watching
it I'll see you guys in the very next
video
