and the galaxy does five with its two
gigabytes of ram and powerful quad-core
processor is a fast phone there's really
no doubt about it but like we saw on
some of the speed test we did there
definitely is some room for improvement
so in this video i'm going to show you
how to activate what I like to call
beast mode but Before we jump into it I
want to give a big shout out to the
sponsor for today's video in $6.00
shirts where I actually bought this
shirt and a lot of the other ones you
see me wearing in my videos before they
became a sponsor for the show so if it
what an awesome tee like the one I'm
wearing now are one from the hundreds of
designs available and you want an even
better deal why just six bucks a shirt
click on that first link down in the
description
get yourself an amazing deal and help
support the channel in the process
alright let's get right into it so the
first step in activating beast mode or
at least making the galaxy s5 feel more
responsive is turning off the DoubleTap
to s voice feature on the home button
so I already covered this in my tips and
tricks video for the galaxy s5 which
I'll link down below but in case you
miss it in you happen to be somebody who
doesn't use s voice do this by going
into the phone's system settings
tapping on s voice and then unchecking
the open via home key option this
results in the home button no longer
having to wait in C if you're gonna
double tap press voice which in turn
takes you to the home screen almost
instantaneously but it's still not
technically instant due to TouchWiz is
relatively slow animations which just
won't fly in this world where instant
gratification is almost the expectation
so step number two is to either reduce
or completely eliminate all animations
now doing this isn't as straightforward
as disabling s voice but it still
doesn't require any kind of routing or
jailbreaking at all you have to do is
unlock developer options you can do this
by going into the main system settings
tapping on about device then hitting on
the build number option about seven or
eight times until the phone tells you
that you are now a developer after doing
that hop back into the main system
settings tap on the newly available
developer options and set the window
transition and animator scales down to
either 0.5 X 2
the animation times in half or if you
feel like being really crazy
turn them off completely this pretty
much results in instantaneous home
button response and on top of that it
also makes opening and switching in
between apps feel a little bit faster as
well the third step in activating beast
mode is turning off the lockscreen
effect which you can do by going into
the system settings going into the
lockscreen option tapping on the unlock
effect option and then finally setting
it to none turning off the unlocked
effect makes getting straight into what
you want much faster on the galaxy s5
which can make a pretty big difference
when you think about how many times you
lock and unlock your phone every day the
fourth step is to uninstall or otherwise
disable unwanted apps that may be taking
up some of those precious system
resources despite the fact that you may
not even be using them so to find out
which apps are running in the background
go to the main system settings tap on
application manager swipe over to the
running tab and take note of any apps
that you don't want our use that are
hogging up Ram once you've got an idea
of the apps that you want to remove
swipe over to the all tab tap on the
applications that you want to delete are
disabled and then hit the uninstall or
turnoff buttons so those first four
steps alone should make the galaxy s5
feel like a much more responsive device
but if you're like me and you always
want to take it to the next level I've
got another step you can try out that
may significantly boost the performance
every apps so if you actually how Google
is making Android faster video that I
did a while back which I'll link to down
below in case you haven't seen it you
know that I'm talking about art but
before we go any further I have to warn
you that enabling art can cause some of
your apps to not work properly so think
long and hard before doing this last
step but if you just have a need for
speed or you want to try it out anyways
go into the main system settings go to
the previously unlocked developer
options tap on select runtime system
select the use art option and then
finally press the ok button to restart
the device and enable art along with its
more efficient a ot compiler now the
difference in speed and responsiveness
from all these steps isn't going to be
night and day as we're not changing any
of the physical Hardware on the phone
but we are tinkering with the software
just enough to where if you were to use
even just one of these
mm your s5 you should be able to see or
at least feel a slight increase in
responsiveness and of course if you use
three or more you'll be running on
full-on beast mode but that pretty much
wraps it up for me in this video if you
enjoyed it show your love with a big
thumbs up and make sure to subscribe to
