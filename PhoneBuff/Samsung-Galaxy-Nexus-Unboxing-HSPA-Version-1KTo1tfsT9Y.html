today we'll be doing an unboxing on the
phone we've all been waiting for the
Samsung Galaxy Nexus this is the 16
gigabyte unlocked hspa+ version so what
that says go ahead and take off the
cover so you have the device up front
quick hardware tour on the front you
have the 4.6 5 inch display it's a 1280
by 720 p resolution you don't have
capacitive buttons down here instead
they're gonna be on the screen itself in
Android Ice Cream Sandwich and up top
you have a front facing camera and of
course your usual sensors on the back of
the device you have your 5 megapixel
camera and an LED flash and the speaker
right here at the very bottom on the
left side you have nothing but the
volume rocker for up and down and on the
right side you have your power key and
these three little prongs which are
probably for charging it on some kind of
doc and on top you have nothing again so
let's go ahead and take this sticker off
so you can see the screen is just
beautiful so with that out of the way
it's look it with inside the box so you
have your Quick Start Guide from Samsung
you have these headphones for your 3.5
millimeter headset jack you have your
USB to micro USB cord you have your 1750
milliamp battery and last but not least
you have your USB the wall adapter and
that's just about it for the unboxing I
do it quick a size comparison for you
guys just so you guys could see those
you're wondering how big this phone is
so I'll compare the
austin texas to a couple of devices with
different screen sizes first up being
the epic touch 4g and this is a 4.5 inch
screen and I you can see I mean the two
phones are pretty much the same size
can't really tell that much of a
difference I'll say the Galaxy Nexus is
a little bit taller but as far as width
they're about the same let's compare it
to the HTC hd7 this is a 4.3 inch device
and you can see the galaxy's definitely
taller than this guy it's noticeable as
far as with their about the same let's
say the hd7 is a little bit wider but of
course the Galaxy Nexus is dinner
alright and the last photo compared to
is the 4-inch display on the samsung
epic the original one and you can see I
mean the Galaxy Nexus does look pretty
massive next to it and you also got to
take into consideration that the epic is
a lot thicker because of the slide out
keyboard so it's giving you the illusion
that it's actually bigger than it is let
me try to lift the Galaxy Nexus a little
bit to be the same the same height and
now you can see I mean it is definitely
a lot bigger so this gives you an idea
of how big the Galaxy Nexus is i'll go
ahead and hold it in my hand to show you
you know what it would probably look
like in your hand I'm about six foot so
and I mean I feel like I could reach
just about everything but I could see
where I would need to use or not used to
use two hands but I'll need to readjust
the way I'm holding the phone to reach
the opposite corner of the screen
alright that's it for me into some
boxing if you want more pictures and
information on the Galaxy Nexus this
visit form of calm and thanks for
watching video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
