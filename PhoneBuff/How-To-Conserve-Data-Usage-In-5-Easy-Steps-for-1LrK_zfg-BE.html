Volcom in this video I'm giving you my
top five tips to saving or conserving
data on your Android phone so tip number
one is to turn off your background data
on your settings so go over to your
settings go to accounts and sync and you
can either turn off all background data
by tapping the OP button and so this is
an Ice Cream Sandwich on gingerbread or
below what you're going to do is same
thing and go to settings and then you're
going to scroll down to accounting sync
but you could actually just uncheck
background data hit OK and I can see
these will automatically turn off so let
me hit OK and there you go it turns off
so anyway I'll go back to this phone and
as you can see I already turned off all
background data but say you don't want
to do that you know I want my Gmail
council sync I can just go into for
example my Twitter uncheck it and then
go over to like this email account and
uncheck it if I wanted to as well
so this is one way of you know reducing
the amount of things that are synced in
the background which of course take up
data so that's tip number one tip number
two is to either delete the widgets
you're not using so a whole bunch of
widgets on my home screen I'm now using
the widget just delete it right off
because every time those things sync up
with the server for whatever widget it
is for example this ESPN which is syncs
with ESPN servers CNN with CNN servers
etc so if I'm not using them just delete
them but otherwise let's say for example
this weather widget I I still want to
keep it on my phone but I don't want to
use as much data as it is right now I
could tap on it go over to the settings
now obviously the settings going to be a
little bit different for each widget but
I'll just use this is example so you go
to the settings in this case to be under
weather services and you can see the
refresh interval
I'm just going to push it to let's say
two hours you know sometimes I see
people with their phones set at 15
minutes and obviously if you set it 15
minutes every single you know hour
you're gonna check it four times where
if you have one hour two hours you're
checking a lot less and obviously you
don't really need it to check all that
often so anyway that's step number two
tip number three is to go over to your
settings if you're an Ice Cream Sandwich
or above and go to data usage and say
yourself a data warning and data limits
or examiner's going to set my data limit
right now I have 5 gigabytes and what
you can actually do is go over to your
app so for example go to Facebook and if
you wanted to restrict the app to only
use data when you're actually opening
the app itself on the screen you can do
that so you can just check this restrict
background data button hit OK and now
Facebook won't I use the data unless I
actually open the app myself so
obviously if I won notifications so I
can uncheck it but you get the idea
you can do this with just about any app
that shows up in this list and there's
definitely good ways to save yourself up
you know if you make bites here and
there up data so now step number four or
tip number four is to when you're going
your browser use the mobile web sites
whenever you cancel I know it's nice to
look at full web sites on your Android
phone because hey they can load them up
but honestly mobile web sites are not
only faster but they also take up a lot
less data and another thing you want to
do is go over to your settings and say
you're just like scrolling our browsing
through the New York Times you can go
over to bandwidth management within the
browser settings and uncheck load images
so that way when you go to New York are
the New York Times or whatever website
you go to you can just load up just the
text and that way you're not loading
images because for example you know an
article for example a poem of calm the
text will be only like 10 kilobytes
where the picture will be like 50 or 60
kilobytes so obviously if you don't
really need the picture and it doesn't
really even matter there's no point to
load it so that's step number four or
tip number four and the last tip and
probably the most important is to use
Wi-Fi as you can see my Wi-Fi is on any
time you can and you know you don't
obviously you're not always going to
have access to Wi-Fi but what you can do
is like for example on your Play Store
you can go over to the settings and what
you could do is set it to where apps
only update on Wi-Fi so if you have this
guy checked right here they'll only
update when you're on Wi-Fi connection
because you don't want to just be
updating apps you know when you're on 3G
or 4G because that's going to be using
up your data plan so that's one thing
you want to do if you're downloading
apps in general try to do it when you're
on a Wi-Fi connection if you're
downloading email attachments if you're
sending pictures to a friend or whatever
it is do it over Wi-Fi because those
things take up a lot of bandwidth and
you know it's just
really something that you could wait for
most of the time so anyway those are my
top five tips hopefully they help you if
