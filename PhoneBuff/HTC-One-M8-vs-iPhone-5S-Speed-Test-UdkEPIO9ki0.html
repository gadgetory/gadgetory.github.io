in this video we're gonna be doing a
speed test between the all-new HTC One
and the Apple iPhone 5s but we're not
going to be doing just any speed test
and instead like we always do here in
the channel we're going to be doing it
foam buff style where we put each of
these devices through the same virtual
obstacle course to see which one
finishes first between the two alright
so both phones are coming off your fresh
reboot both of them are connected to the
same Wi-Fi network and as you can see
neither of them have any apps running in
the background so it's gonna be a nice
and even test and with that said let's
go ahead and jump right into it by
opening and starting the stopwatch on
both phones next step up is the
calculator which both phones just slide
through the camera seems to be a little
bit faster on the iPhone 5s with it
already into the gallery app and on to
Temple Run 2 where the HTC One seems to
be falling behind a little bit maybe a
good 3 to 4 seconds but lucky for it
we're just half way into this pizza so
still plenty of time for it to catch up
next step up and this virtual obstacle
course is smash it where the iPhone 5s
takes advantage of its early lead HTC
One is just a few seconds behind but as
you can see it was able to narrow that
early lead the iPhone as head and going
into dumb ways to die it looks like both
phones are actually tied so going into
the Google Earth app we are neck and
neck
any phone could win this competition
could windows speed test and as you can
see the HTC One is loading up Google
Earth a little bit more jittery and
stuttery than the iPhone 5s but
nonetheless it does finish first so it
goes on to the next step which is
Netflix
where it loads up what is currently my
favorite show right now and house of
cards so the iPhone 5s is a few seconds
behind the HTC One but as we saw earlier
that could change within a couple apps
the HTC one loads up score mobile and
the score mobile article without a hitch
just getting into score mobile is the
iPhone 5s whereas the HTC One finish
this up dictionary.com and goes on to
the browser test where it loads up the
mobile Berge site looks like the
dictionary.com app is loading up on the
iPhone 5s whereas the full Versailles
and the final test for this video
was letting up on the HTC one so if the
iPhone 5s wants to make a comeback it
better do it now because that verge site
is just about done and actually there
you go one minute and 37 seconds is the
official time for the HTC One in this
form of style speed test Ivan Perez
finishes up with a time of 1 minute and
45 seconds making the clear winner for
this video the HTC one that is it for me
in this video guys I hope you guys
enjoyed I'm just about out of breath and
I'll see you guys in the very next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
