then this video i want to show you
what's on my android phone so in this
case is a samsung galaxy s3 from
t-mobile first thing you'll probably
notice on my home screen is the live
wallpaper i have running it's an app
called NFL live wallpapers that i
purchased about two years ago developer
actually made a newer version now but
this one works for me so i'm just going
to keep using it as you can see you
could pick from any one of the 32 NFL
teams i currently have the rest in
selector that's my favorite team you
choose the flag style camera speed wind
speed so you customize a few of the
things over here and something you could
also do is you can make it so it
actually rotates when you switch from
home screen to home screen so you get a
3d look at the helmet which really makes
it cool but I don't have that enabled
right now next widget you'll notice is
this little clock / weather widget which
is called HD widgets I did a review on
the channel on this i'm not going to go
too far into it but basically i like it
because it's clean you could customize
how the clock looks have a background
looks even where this little weather
icon shows up and when you tap on it you
get a 5 day forecast to keep track of
multiple cities etc so definitely like
it and then the last widget on my home
screen is little posted style widget
which is actually color notes so you
don't actually have to use it as a
widget it's an actual app itself too but
i use it as a widget as well so that way
you know if you keep track of what i
need to do and when you tap on it you
can actually check them off so it's a
great way to stay productive let's go
ahead and look at the apps now though
i'll go ahead and look at him from
alphabetical order so first one its
amazon basically I'm you guys probably
know how this one works i buy everything
on amazon that i can i get free shipping
with amazon prime thing but nonetheless
that's what i like this app right here
is called google analytics and it's
really for people who have websites you
want to keep track of you know your
visitors and how they got to you and
whatnot that's how I keep track of foam
buff next app is a beast mobile I don't
really recommend antivirus on Android so
I don't think you need it this one's
free so I don't mind it but the main
reason I use is because if you lose it
you keep track of it like located online
I'm not going to go into the stock apps
obviously because that's what comes on
the GALEX has to do with TouchWiz
normally so we'll skip right over to
Google Chrome it's what I use instead of
the stock browser because you know i
just find it to be fast
not like the interface we would early
win over color notes dictionary right
here basically you know to define words
but now with the better voice actions or
you know voice search I actually a lot
of times it's find myself tapping this
guy and saying you know what does this
mean and I get a definition right there
especially when I get the jelly bean
update on here I'm definitely probably
not going to be using this google earth
is another app i have facebook of course
this little app right here the
flashlight is something i really like i
even have it on my lock screen so when
you unlock my phone and unlock it i have
these four icons here that i paid you
know open up and it open straight to mag
messaging phone camera etc i really like
having flash right here because when i
open it boom it opens up my flashlight
and that way I could actually um you
know see or the keyhole is though I
might want to turn it into my house or
my car I don't have to worry about that
but it's called that one's called HD
flashlight so if you guys want that from
google play store it's actually free as
well have Flipboard and flixster this
app right here is called future SMS I
actually likes a lot because you know if
you're trying to send someone a text
message we don't want to send it right
now for example if you want to send it
somewhere off into the future you could
do that for example I use it a lot for
people's birthday so like their birthday
you know is tomorrow for tonight at
midnight outset a text saying happy
birthday that way automatically sends it
so you don't miss people's birthdays and
things like that pretty cool little app
that you know doesn't work for you let's
see what else Google+ don't really need
to go into that this app right here at
the top left is gym rats what I use when
I go to the gym I did a review on this
on bomba as well so I'm not gonna go too
far into it but basically you could set
up routines and then you could go
through them like for example you just
hit this little play and you know you
could go from exercise to exercise and
kind of walks you through them and if
you want to see a description of the
exercise and how to do it actually shows
you little pictures and whatnot so
that's definitely a cool app that I like
a lot and actually use that a lot hotel
tonight is an app that I have you know I
don't really you know have it on my
phone all the time I download it once in
a while when I need it but nonetheless
i'll go ahead and show you guys what it
is basically if you're like in an area
for example i go and when i go to vega
science also if I want to stay an extra
night it'll find hotels that haven't yet
been sold so the hotels will actually
sell those
rooms at a lower rate and then normal
and you know if you're booking in that
night you just need night to crash
somewhere it's a cool little app that
you get like really discounted prices
like I've gotten hotels in Vegas for
like five bucks or something like that
so crazy this app right here light flow
light basically it allows you to
customize your notifications so for
example if I go into here I can actually
change the notification color for all my
notification so for my gmail accounts
for my missed calls my gtalk for my low
battery etc for when it's charging so go
and show you like for example if I want
to have a notification on bluetooth is
on I could enable it I could choose you
know what color I want and all that good
stuff so that's definitely a pile
recommend checking out let's see what
else my xbox live basically I just uses
to keep track of you know who's online
on xbox live I don't really use it all
that much but you know I like having on
here because I can send messages to
people and receive their messages and
whatnot and see what new game throughout
so anyway that is that you guys see that
you know I can see what games are
playing madden 13 is pretty much the
game i play all the time now um let's go
on so we're do win over NFL teams you
know playbooks play music all the play
apps i have on here so real calc this is
the app i use instead of the stock
calculated because i don't know about
you guys but it reminds me of the
calculator is to use in an algebra when
i was in high school scientific
calculator works really really well and
it's free and it takes up you know the
full screen if you want it to so
definitely something i recommend you
know i can disable the regular
calculator app but I hit it i'll show
you guys that later s voice s memos the
typical you know s apps that come on the
galaxy s3 these are obviously not going
to be available to if you don't have
TouchWiz ESPN scorecenter so oh my
what's on my tablet video I actually use
Fox Sports but on this guy is ESPN
scorecenter because it seems like it's
you know more made for phones and it's a
good way to keep track of all the scores
for all your favorite sports so that is
that and that's free as well settings
icon don't need to talk about that So
Solid explore ICS by es file explorer
when i did my what's on my tablet video
a lot of you guys were recommending
solid explorer so i actually checked it
out and I do like it looks really clean
like the way you could actually a copy
files over from one place to another for
example I think if I turn it into if i
rotated over it'll do it let's see after
I tried all my tears so if I could go
from you know for example want to copy a
file from here so you see its internal
memory internal memory I could go into
for example here and then copy files
back and forth really cool way to you
know be able to explore your files
definitely recommend them that's free as
well speed test is an app that I use you
know basically anywhere i go i like to
see you know what my internet speeds are
so i'm on team always is tell this one
right here is Wi-Fi but you can see my
speeds like i don't know where i was
here i got 15 megabytes down per second
three megabytes up which is pretty good
you know t mobile's 4g network and over
here you can see i got some other speeds
but it's a good way to check out like
you know if you're trying to load a
website or youtube whatever if you want
to be able to tell is it your internet
slow is the phone that's low or is it
the service so it's a good way to kind
of figure out you know why is your why
is it basically not loading at the speed
you one um what I'll square I did a
review on that channel as well basically
this allows you to take credit card
payments at a percentage feel like two
point seven five percent a day when you
sign up you actually get a free little
reader you plug it into the headphone
jack of your phone and you get actually
basically swiped the card and they could
sign on the screen itself really cool I
don't really use it all that much but
it's one of that's for like really cool
that you want to have on there just to
kind of show off but i have used it in
the past you know someone's like oh you
know i don't have cash cow for
explaining a bill or not a bill but like
they I don't know we do something they
need to give me cash and they don't have
cash I just take credit cards so that's
pretty cool twonky server right here is
what I've used so Wi-Fi is all for now
it doesn't let me go into it but it's
what I used to share files from my phone
to my xbox so for example Ike if I have
music on my phone I kid you know turn on
this little server and then for my xbox
360 connect to it and then play the
music on my phone right for my TV you
know without having to actually transfer
any files ATT uverse is what I use to
control my TV so this is actually what i
use as far as my TV guide and also to
manage my recordings on my DVR and let's
see we're almost done here XD
a this is something I use to check out
the threads on XDA developers this the
free version it's okay i mean i like
going on the regular website so i find
it navigating a little bit easier but
sometimes when i share our when I
favorite a certain threat it's a good
way to keep track of it with that app I
skipped over WordPress so this is the
app that I actually used to manage foam
above you know if I get a comment could
read your comments here I could see the
stats I could you know change or edit
some of the article that I found like
grammatical mistake or whatever that's
pretty cool and in the last appt you
know that isn't stock is edge this is
what I used to get like my ringtones and
whatnot so my ringtones for my phone
itself or my text message notifications
so for example when I had cyanogenmod 10
installed on here so now I'm let's talk
by the way because haven't you know
realize that by now I'm on the stock rom
but when I had Santa jinhua 10 I like
the ringtone a lot which was a you know
their custom ringtone and I was able
actually find it on here and I still
used as my ringtone so that's the
mcdonald i like it kind of sounds like
like dubstep or something but anyway
that is what's on my phone i try to go
through that as fast as I could because
these videos tend to get kind of long
maternity 10 minutes now alright so it's
pretty much it for what's on my android
phone if you want more app ideas check
out how to men's video they actually did
it what's on my android phone video as
well and that they actually had a rooted
phone so they have a lot of different
apps that i didn't have over here
definitely worth checking out made a
link in the tradition box below they do
a lot of tutorials and reviews just like
i do so definitely a channel we're
checking out but anyway that's pretty
much it for me in this video if you
found it helpful please give me a thumbs
up and subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already all right thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
