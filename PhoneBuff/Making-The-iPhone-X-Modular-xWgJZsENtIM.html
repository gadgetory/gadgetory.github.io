heard of modular smartphones before or a
phone that can change or be added on to
over time but what you probably haven't
heard of yet is a modular smartphone
case so when Ryder Shield reached out
wanting to team up and sponsor a video
telling me that their new iPhone cases
were also modular it got my attention
because we've done drought tests on
rhino shield cases before we did one
where we dropped the oneplus three off
of the third story of a building and the
phone was able to survive that we'll
also be doing a drop test in this video
so stick around for that
but the idea of having that high level
of protection with the case that can
basically make your iPhone modular is
interesting so this is the Rhino shield
mod case and at first glance it looks
like a regular bumper it has a raised
lip on both the front and the back along
with their shocks red material that
allows your phone to withstand drops of
at least 11 feet and being a bumper the
phone's design isn't hidden like some of
the bigger and bulkier cases do so if
you want to maintain that design if you
want to be able to appreciate all the
hard work that the team at Apple put
into it then a bumper obviously is one
way they want to go but up the first
place where the mod case is different
from other bumpers is you can completely
customize the look of it the room on the
back of the phone and the buttons on the
side are removable so you can swap them
out with different colors to make
whatever unique color combo you want of
course given that the back glass on the
iPhone 8 or the iPhone 10 costs a lot of
money to repair you might want an extra
layer of protection on the back just in
case it like falls on a rock or
something and what's cool is the mod
case can actually transform from being a
bumper to a full-on protective case a
backplate already comes in the box that
you can just pop on and they also have a
bunch of different ones that you can
choose from you can do a simple setup
like this with a clear back and a white
bumper so you can kind of preserve the
idea of having a bumper or if you don't
care about hiding that Apple logo you
can do a whites marbled backplate that
we actually paired with white side
buttons that gives you a nice and classy
look and then there's my personal
favorite the carbon fiber back plates
with yellow buttons this to me looks
absolutely amazing I'm a big fan of this
I just
put it a Lamborghini wallpaper on there
just to kind of complete the supercar
look but again you can make hundreds of
different combos to match your own style
but the modularity on this case goes
beyond just changing it from being a
bumper to a full case or making them
look different there's also the option
to upgrade some of your phone's
capabilities like the camera so runner
shield has four different lenses right
now that you can choose from that you
can just twist on when you have lens
adapter installed there's a fisheye lens
which honestly I'm not a big fan of
because it's like I don't really take
those kind of photos but I am a fan of
the HD wide-angle lens that looks just
like a lens you'd get for a DSLR it even
comes with a lens hood and it gives you
a crisp and clear 110 degree viewing
angle with almost no Distortion
they also have a super wide angle lens
that has a crazy 165 degree viewing
angle if you really want to get like
everything into your shots and my
personal favorite is this combo lens
they have which can not only give you a
100 degree wide angle but you can also
twist off the top layer of the lens and
have it double as a macro lens letting
you get super close up to things to get
those macro shots that you normally just
wouldn't be able to now I think the most
interesting part about this case and
like the whole modular system is Rhino
shield says this is just the beginning
they have other things in the works like
back plates that can be used as a wallet
with little slots they're also working
on supposedly like a battery backplate
and there's even these two little slots
here towards the bottom that right now
can be used to insert a lanyard but
they're also kind of hinting that those
slots will be used for something else in
the future so I'm excited to see what
happens I'm excited to see the modular
system grow I think a lot of companies
have tried to do modular smartphones and
they kind of failed and I honestly do
think that a modular smartphone case
does make a little bit more sense
because a most people are gonna put a
case on their phones anyways and be you
can put this case on the iPhone you
already have you don't go out and buy a
whole separate phone now unfortunately
the mod case isn't yet available for
Android phones that will be coming later
but for now they still have their new
crashguard case available for phones
like the galaxy s 8 and the pixel 2
which are supposed to be even thinner
and tougher than they were before thanks
to a new
material but Before we jump out of this
video there's still one thing left to do
we have to do a drop test right we have
to test durability this thing because
it's a case and I also wanted to test
out these lenses like do a video test
for you guys so I figured there's only
one thing we can really do right do a
drop test filmed entirely on iPhones
using these lenses so let's go outside
alright so we are outside what you're
looking through right now is the lens of
an iPhone 8 plus we got the HD lens
attached like the big boy over here for
the side camera we have an iPhone 7 with
that awesome carbon fiber back plates
but the lens we have attached here is
the wide angle so like that 165 degree
angle it does give you a little bit of
distortion but I think it's the best
lens to put in this situation where we
want to make sure that it captures the
drop which speaking of here is the
iPhone 10 so I'll go ahead and put in my
pocket and drop it as if I did it on
accident it hurts it hurts
does it work though yep we're good so
next drop is a little bit higher up this
is probably the second most common drop
you got your chest heights say you're
texting and like your accident I sneeze
it's still I don't know I've done
thousands of drops s and yet it's still
you know hurts a little inside so phone
is still good it's that time it's that
time where we do the extreme test I mean
this is not so extreme but we're gonna
do something a little extreme right
we're gonna lift it up I'm about 6 foot
tall 3 2 1 okay it looks like it's good
so yes we are still good let's see the
the gesture works I remember before when
our their job tries to network all right
we're good I mean there you have it
that's the Rhino shield mod case it's
gonna protect your phone obviously from
these everyday drops we already did a
drop test with a crash guard from like
over 22 feet so I wasn't too surprised
still scared me a little but if you guys
want to learn more about the mod case
check out the link down below in the
description they're also giving you guys
10% off you guys are interested but I'll
put all the details down below so
outside of that that's pretty much it
for me in this video I think I've done
enough I'll see you guys and the very
next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
