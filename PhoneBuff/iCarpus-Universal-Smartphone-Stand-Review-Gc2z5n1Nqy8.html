and this will be doing a review on the I
Karpis Universal smartphone stand i
bought the sky for about twelve dollars
on amazon a couple of days ago and i've
liked it so much that I want to do a
video here sharing it with you guys so
before I actually show you know how it
works with a couple of different devices
want to show you the stand itself you
know you can see right here worse in the
spring system you have three problems
that hold your device the middle one
being the one that you actually moved
back and forth of course because it's on
the spring it actually snapped right
back into place and that's what holds
your device nice and firmly you see the
edges are rounded off so that way grips
your device and it's relatively thin so
I mean you'll be able to fit into your
pocket without it bothering you all that
much it's not thin enough where you can
fit it in your wallet or something like
that but you know if you're going you
have a particular in there if you got
you just holding your pocket and whether
it's in your shirt or in your pants and
you don't really feel it all that much
so it's pretty cool very very
lightweight and it seems like it's made
of good material I mean I've had it for
a couple days and it doesn't seem to the
spring will break of course if you pull
it too much a mite but I haven't done
that thus far so it's go ahead and show
you how it works in a couple of
different devices here's the iphone 4s
you would just pull the screen back and
put it inside of it just like that make
sure the rounded edges you know cover
the phone on that edge standing with
this edge and once it's in there
securely you could actually no move it
around and see how steady this i mean
it's not going to fall out and of course
the main reason you got it for is to be
able to watch you know videos or games
in landscape mode just like that you're
actually able to use your device to it's
pretty sturdy it's actually reversible
as well so you can do it but it doesn't
give you a different angle so that's
kind of unfortunate but the good thing
is you could actually also use it in
portrait mode like that and again it's
pretty you know firmware stable but
that's only because this device has a
very flat bottom if we're using the
device was kind of a curved bottom it
doesn't work as well show you that in a
little bit but anyway that's the iphone
4s do the iphone 5 great thing with
iphone 5 is because it's a little bit
taller you can actually adjust the
portrait mode angles a little more so
for example if you wanted a high angle
you could move this guy down just like
that and you get a pretty high angle
here if you want a lower angle kind of
move this guy down like that and you
know you get a lower angle so pretty
cool
also works the same way you know on
landscape like you would expect you able
to sit down and use your iPhone watch a
video whatever you want to do so those
are the iphones going to show you how it
works on the galaxy s3 so bigger device
you know when i first got a kind of
wanting you know is going to be able to
stretch out to cover this with and it
does and it doesn't relatively easily
you know i just put it on like that and
again holds it nice and firm and what's
really really well I mean to be able to
watch videos no all my phone like this
on youtube set it on my desk is really
really awesome like I said is reversible
if you want but doesn't give you a
triangle so I'm not gonna show you that
now port removes a little bit
differently galaxy s3 it's kind of
wobbly as you can see I mean technically
you set it down and it'll if you don't
touch it it'll work just fine but
because the bottom is kind of curved on
the galaxy s3 it doesn't actually have a
really really good you know stable grip
on it so anyway that's the galaxy
history you know i'ma show you how it
works with the case as well because now
some people might be wondering will work
with the case because a lot of you guys
you know have kids learning phones
there's like I do so it actually does
work you know just the same it's very
very stable and again it works just fine
I don't think the case does anything to
help the portrait mode on the galaxy so
you know it doesn't see kind of wobbles
we're on the iphone i wasn't doing that
so well last advice i'll show you and
it's the biggest device i have is the
samsung galaxy note obviously I you know
five plus inches you know and you're not
going to think that this little stand
will be able to do it but it actually
can and you see works perfectly fine
again very very stable and this is
pretty awesome and get the screen this
big being able to either stand is
absolutely awesome and Porsche mode
works really real on the galaxy note
because it does have a very flat bottom
you know you're able to use it without
it wobbling all that much but that's
pretty much it for my little review on
this stand you know I've liked a lot
definitely recommend it and you know
like I said for about 12 bucks something
that's definitely worth it you can hold
in your pocket pretty easily but that's
pretty much it for me in this video if
you found it helpful please give me a
thumbs up and if you haven't already
