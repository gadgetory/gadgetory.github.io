public comm and in this video we're
reviewing the samsung galaxy note this
is actually the AT&amp;amp;T version and before
i go into the review i'm just going to
do a quick hardware tour on the back of
the galaxy note you have an 8 megapixel
camera capable of 1080p video capture
you have a LED flash at the bottom of
the back you have your speaker grill
right here at the top of the device you
have nothing but your 3.5 millimeter a
headset jack at the bottom you have your
microphone right here your USB charging
port and of course the s pen which you
could pull in and out easily just like
that at the left side of the device you
have nothing but the volume rocker right
here at the right side you have nothing
but the power key so there is no
dedicated power or a camera button on
this phone and of course on the front
you have your 2-megapixel front-facing
camera your typical sensors and ear
piece right here at the bottom you have
your capacitive touch buttons for a menu
home back and search and of course what
either draws you in or you know moves
you away from the galaxy note is the
massive 5.3 inch going diagonally
display that Super AMOLED and is 1280 by
800 and resolution so with that said I
I'll go ahead and go into some of the
things I dislike and some of things I
like about the galaxy note starting with
what I dislike alright so the first
thing that I dislike about the phone and
probably the most obvious is the size it
is a little bit too big now I'm not
necessarily complaining about the screen
size obviously when you get the galaxy
note you're looking for that big screen
you're looking for that hybrid tablet
smartphone experience but obviously one
of the drawbacks to this is the
one-handed use now I could use the
bottom right of the screen no problem
the bottom left I can use all the
capacitive buttons here at the bottom no
problem even the top right so basically
I could access you know pretty much
everything on the phone with one hand
with the exception of the top left
corner so basically it from you know the
here up I can't use it so I'll go ahead
and open up a nap and show you you know
where it could be annoying so for
example let's say i'm looking at dvds on
flicks
and I wanted to go back home I can't
really reach the home by I mean this is
the farthest my finger will go of course
i could just tilt the phone with my the
back of my fingers and you know hit the
home button that way which is a
workaround but you know it is a little
bit of an inconvenience so not that big
of a deal obviously like I said if
you're going for the galaxy note you're
going for that big phone screen and that
tablet like experience but there is
something else that I dislike about the
phone and that's the processor inside
it's a Snapdragon s3 at 1.5 gigahertz
the dual core now it isn't slow by any
means but it isn't as fast as this icky
notes counterpart and the international
version which is you know much much
faster than this guy especially the
better GPU um and also considering how
you know when it came out I would rather
have seen the Snapdragon s4 at least in
this guy because the Snapdragon s4 is
also compatible with the up 4G LTE which
is the main reason why Samsung opted not
to include their icky nose processor in
this guy so with that said the last
thing that I dislike about the phone
which the good news is it will actually
change is the fact that it comes with
Android 2.3 pre-installed so again
considering how late this phones come
out for AT&amp;amp;T you know I would expect it
to come with ice cream sandwich instead
it's preloaded with two point three
point six um like I said an update
should be coming out soon so isn't that
big of an issue and you know by the time
you watch this video perhaps the updates
dirty out so you might be able to just
cross that one off your list but anyway
right now that's something that's a
little bit disappointing but you know
those are the main things I dislike what
the phone which is actually good news
because everything else I'm really happy
with the phone it compares a lot to the
samsung galaxy s2 I was just a bigger
version if you will but you know what
that said I'll go ahead and talk about
the things that I like about the samsung
galaxy note in the particular alright so
like I said the galaxy note is pretty
much you know the same thing as the
galaxy s2 other than the bigger screen
and a few differences and that's really
what i'm going to talk about because you
know the cameras on the front and the
back or
same the TouchWiz user interface that
you see is the same and even the
processor thus a dragon s3 you know with
steam than t mobile's and 80s version of
the galaxy s2 so what do I like about
the galaxy note and you know what's
different about it compared to the
galaxy s2 other than just the screen
size and the first thing and probably my
favorite thing is the screens resolution
or the screens clarity it's 1280 by 800
meaning it's an HD screen and it just
really makes everything that you look at
on the phone absolutely you know amazing
i mean i'll go ahead and go to the web
browser really quick and i did a quick
google search for phone buff and I mean
just scrolling through the google
results page it's just you know amazing
on here I mean it's so easy and so quick
I mean I have the galaxy nexus with a
4.6 5-inch screen yet you know for some
reason even though it's not that big of
a difference between the two um it just
feels so much better in here I mean it
really makes me feel like I'm on a
desktop more so than on a smartphone so
definitely a great experience there of
course watching YouTube videos is
amazing as well I'll go ahead and load
up a quick youtube video that I uploaded
recently and um you know this is nothing
like pulling out the galaxy note out of
your pocket and you know showing strong
some friends of youtube video you know
you guys all could huddle around the
phone and you know I'll be able to see
clearly what's going on the video
instead of you know on a tiny screen or
a foreign screen even I mean it just
makes a huge difference so anyway that's
one of my favorite features obviously if
you're looking at this review that's
probably what has you interested in the
galaxy know in the first place but the
next thing that I really love about the
galaxy note is the S Pen so the S Pen
you know if you haven't watched a review
yet you probably think is just your
normal stylus and you know it is in that
sense I mean it works just like a normal
stylus would um you can move from screen
to screen I could grab the notification
bar go to my apps and whatnot but the
key difference is one it has a button
right here that when you press it and
hold it in touch the screen it has a
totally different input and second the
little tip of this pen and the screen
allow for 256 different levels of
pressure sensitivity so I did a review
and how
you on the s pen and i'll put the link
in the description box below because i
rather just focus on the phone but i'll
just do a quick walkthrough as far as
the pen goes so like I said you can use
as a normal pen but if i press and hold
them the little button right here and
double tap I actually get this little S
Memo light application opened up and you
know i can write something like hi
really quick and let's say it when I was
taking notes on what I was looking on
sales at a website I could press right
here look at what i was looking at
before let go and go right back to my
note and you know make a note about
whatever i'm looking at so pretty cool
functionality right there of course you
could also take a screenshot by pressing
and holding on the button and then
pressing and holding on the screen takes
a screenshot automatically will open up
the editor in which you could you know
start editing the photo and then you can
save it share it print it whatever i'll
go ahead and discard this guy really
quick also cool thing what the s pen is
it replaces some functions of the or it
replaces these capacitive buttons too so
for example let's go ahead and open up
actually I open up the Play Store and if
i press and hold the button again and
swipe up it opens up the menu if I swipe
up again it takes the mini away but I
swipe down what happens is it goes home
if I open sky up again and swipe let's
say I go into the apps and swipe back
it'll it'll replace the back function so
I don't think I did that right there you
go so I backwards or holding the button
it replaces the back burner so basically
these three functions are replaced other
than the search key so really cool
functionality to spen and really quick
i'll show you the different level of
sensitivity so i'll just bring this guy
up and i'll show you if i make a light
if i press lightly on the screen i can
make a line right there so hopefully
that shows or you can see how thin that
is um vs that one so it is you know
really depends on how hard you touch the
screen so you can see this one is
thinner than this line right here not
sure if that comes through on camera but
believe me there is a difference as far
as how thin and how thick the lines are
just based off of how much I'm pushing
on the screen so it's kind of like a
real pen and
sense that when you press harder more
ink is going to be you know put on to
the memo pad but that's all I want to
talk about the s-pen like I said if you
want more information on that and you
know more in-depth look at it this look
at the video linked in the description
and the last thing that I want to talk
about for the galaxy note is the fact
that the phone is still fast you know
even though the Snapdragon processor
which I kind of complaint about earlier
it's still fast i did a apps PR
comparison speed person against a phone
like the iphone 4s or the Galaxy Nexus
and I did beat those guys out and also
you have 4g LTE so I'll go ahead and run
a speedtest really quick to show you
guys what kind of speeds you expect with
18 TS 4g LTE network so right now i'm
not in the best Arab what four out of
five bars so I'm not a full reception
i'll go ahead and begin the test and
show you guys the speeds that you can
expect I mean obviously every area
differs or varies but you know as you
can see right here I'm getting what 5.8
as probably and go up to 6 megabytes
down per second so 6.6 6.7 obviously
those are really really good speeds um I
don't know what happened the apps been
crash on me when it comes to the upload
test that's not doesn't have to do with
the connection with ATT I think
something's going on with the app anyway
um like I said you get about seven
megawatts down or at least I've been
getting seven mega mega bites down where
I am in laguna hills i'm sure some
people have gotten way higher than that
but it's been pretty consistent and it's
pretty good so really happy about the
data speeds um i'm going to do a
quadrant test right now just so you guys
can see what this device will score so
i'll just hit actually no first i'm
going to close out the apps in the
background so let me close these guys
out had a whole bunch open alright so
let's go to quadrant and i'll just
quickly run this test and instead of
making you wait through it and watch the
whole benchmark do its thing i'm just
going to go ahead and pause the video
and then continue it as soon as i get
the results alright so the benchmark is
done i'm just going to hit yes to get
the results
and right now scored a 1697 so that's
probably because i've been doing the
review that's actually a pretty low
score i usually get around 2000 you can
see another benchmark that I did when I
compared this phone to the Galaxy Nexus
they got two thousand that score but
anyway that's the quadrant score other
things they are worth mentioning the
camera it's good it's not great I think
a phone like the HTC One X has a much
better camera compared to the Galaxy
Note what else the speaker quality and
the call quality are pretty good on here
I mean I you know when I've made calls
on here it sounded you know nice and
clear when I listen to music on here it
sounds perfect so I mean overall I'm
really happy with the device I mean
there's like I said there's very little
that I dislike about it a lot to love
about it you know I just wish that you
know yeah it gets ice cream sandwich
sooner rather than later and the only
thing like i said you know that i wrote
what a rather seen was the s4 processor
maybe the enkei knows processor but then
again you know we wouldn't have had 4g
LTE so that's my review on the Galaxy
Note Oh actually you know what I must
show you a quick picture that I took on
this phone just to give you an idea of
the cameras quality and I also did a
1080p video samples so let's check out
the youtube channel for that or go on
form of comm so here's a picture I took
of my dog from this distance and now you
can just see how clear it is so it is a
good camera like I said it's just not as
good as the HTC One X from what I've
seen so far but overall um you know like
i said i'm really happy with the phone
cameras good call quality the speaker
quality the screen is amazing I the pen
like I said makes it very unique it
gives you a whole bunch of different
functions but the main reason you get
this phone is because you want a tablet
like experience with the you know
pocketable size which is exactly what
the galaxy note is you know it does fit
in my pocket it's not the most
comfortable thing our first but because
the device is pretty thin considering
how big it is it isn't all that bad so
anyway that's my review if you found it
