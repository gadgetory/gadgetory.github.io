and this video will show you how to take
screenshots on your samsung galaxy s3 so
the way you do it is uh the swipe your
palm across the screen so now your
finger or anything you're gonna get like
this edge of your palm right here and
it's gonna swipe it from one edge of the
screen to the other like that
and you can see makes a little animation
showing us you know which way we
actually took it so if i go the other
way it'll actually make the screenshot
the other way too so pretty cool but if
it doesn't work on your phone you
actually have to go into the settings go
under motion and then under motion
scroll down where it says palm swipe to
capture make sure this guy's checked on
cuz it was checked off you're not gonna
be able to do that but in some
situations that doesn't actually work
for example when I opened up Temple Run
and say I'm trying to take a picture of
my high score then I try that palm
method
nothing happens is the eyes can see so
the way you would do it in this case is
you're gonna press and hold the power
button right here and the home button
right here at the same time so just
press and hold it for a few seconds and
there you go now I'll just get home and
you can see that both of my screenshots
have been captured so let's tap on this
guy really quick there's my high scored
I just did with the old fashioned method
and then here's my home screen which I
did with the palm at it but anyway I
said for me this video found it helpful
