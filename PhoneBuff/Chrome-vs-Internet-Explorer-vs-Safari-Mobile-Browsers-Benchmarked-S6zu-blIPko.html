calm and in this video we'll be
comparing the Google Chrome browser on
the Galaxy Nexus here on the left to
Internet Explorer on the nokia lumia 900
in the center - of course Safari on the
iPhone 4s on the right so I'll go and
launch each browser up I cleared the
history out on each browser I'm just
gonna do a few benchmarks so first
benchmark will be browser mark so I'll
go ahead and load up browser mark on all
three phones all right so I hit go on
these two first and I'll follow with the
iPhone doesn't really actually matter
we're not comparing as far as which one
finishes first but we're gonna be
looking at the scores on each phone
alright so I just skipped to the results
because you know I don't bore you with
the whole process but anyway only left
the Google Chrome browser on the Galaxy
Nexus scored a 114 thousand two hundred
and sixty three and the Lumia 900 in the
center scored a thirty two thousand and
fifty and lastly the iPhone 4s scored a
eighty six thousand nine hundred and
twenty nine so clearly the winner here
is the Google Chrome browser on the
Galaxy Nexus scoring 114 thousand that's
all you know over twenty five thousand
more than the iPhone and the Lumia 900
definitely you know a lot lower of the
score obviously you know the hardware on
this guy's one point to Tigger
we've got an 800 megahertz dual-core
processor over here and then only a 1.4
gigahertz single core on the Lumia so
that stuff we're gonna have an effect
it's good and launch our next browser or
browser test which is gonna be the
SunSpider test alright so i've loaded up
the son sweater JavaScript benchmark on
each phone and i'll go ahead and tap on
them all around the same time so let's
do it backwards this time we'll do this
guy first
this guy second and this guy last and
again I'll list let them do this thing
and I'll pause the video and as soon as
it's done I'll start recording again
okay so this test is done and the lower
score on this one is actually better so
this the iPhone scored 80
233 the Lumia 900 scored a 67 71 so 6771
and the Android phone the on Google
Chrome scored a 16 24 so again the
Galaxy Nexus and Google Chrome beats out
the competition second place again is
the iPhone 4s and then the Lumia with
the Internet Explorer comes in last once
again so obviously again you know it's
pretty much going in order of the
hardware source the clock frequency and
the amount of course and through real
life performance I've seen you know
pretty much the Galaxy Nexus does have
the faster browser out of the 2 or out
of the 3 the Lumia is slower than both
the iPhone and the galaxy and the
galaxy's faster than the iPhone so you
know pretty much is going in the order
we expected but I'm gonna run one last
benchmark and this one is gonna be the
html5 test alright so I went to html5
test comm and you can see the scores are
pretty big here so no need to put the
phones close to the camera the Galaxy
Nexus in Google Chrome scored 8 371 the
internet explorer in nokia lumia 900
scored 138 and the iPhone 4s on Safari
scored 324 so just let you guys know it
isn't all about the for this test isn't
about the processing speed you know when
I use the stock browser here it gets
like 280 or something like that so this
test especially for html5 is just
basically testing the compatibility with
all the protocols and whatnot so anyway
the Google Chrome browser definitely has
the highest score and followed by the
iPhone so pretty much as a general theme
so overall I mean if you're looking for
the fastest browser browsing experience
you're gonna get it with Androids Google
Chrome obviously it's still in beta only
available in Ice Cream Sandwich and
above
you know Gingerbread and below don't
have it second best experience is gonna
be on the iPhone 4s with Safari I don't
know as far as iOS 6 I don't know what
improvements are gonna be coming to the
browser definitely expect some some
redoing this test and the worst
experience out of the three you know is
on the lumia 900 and internet explorer
obviously in Windows Phone
eight was just announced today or not
announced today but they had an event
today so definitely gonna be expecting a
lot better you know coming around with
Windows 8 but anyway that's it from me
in this video hopefully it gives you a
better idea as far as you know how each
of these browsers scores on the
benchmark test you know real-life
performance like I said it seems to
reflect these benchmarks but you know
results may vary depending on what site
you load especially when it comes these
two because they're so close but anyway
I said to me thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
