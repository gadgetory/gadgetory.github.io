calm and in this video i wanted to share
my thoughts and experiences that I've
had with the galaxy note 2 now I've been
using this phone as my daily driver for
well basically since October when the
first came out in the US and you know
that alone should tell you what my
overall opinion of the phone is
especially when you consider how many
phones I get to work and play with on a
daily basis in this line of work but I'm
still using it as my daily driver today
and you know I'm gonna be changing it
very soon actually which I'll tell you
about in the next video but for now I
want to share with you guys you know
what it's been like for me living with
the galaxy note 2 so let's go ahead and
get right into it so there are so many
things that really make you know having
the Galaxy Note 2 a unique experience
but out of all of them
I don't say the one that really stands
out to me is how many people have come
up to me and asked you know Oh what kind
of phone is that or hey is that the new
galaxy you had a couple of people come
up to me and ask is that the iPad Mini
now regardless of what people ask me the
thing is people are really curious about
the phone I mean I've never had a phone
get so much attention and you know for
those of you guys who are a little bit
shy I think it would be a good
conversation starter
but obviously the phone gets so much
attention because the thing is huge I
mean this is one big phone now for some
people that alone could be a
deal-breaker
in fact I've heard a lot of people say
oh you know I could never use a phone
that big you know I like it but it's
just too big and I can see why some
people would say that for example if you
have smaller hands it could be an issue
I mean it is a big bone and reaching
across the screen can be really really
hard you know as it is if you have
smaller than average hands might be a
deal-breaker and it doesn't really have
to adjust your hand size you can do with
your clothing too for example I know a
lot of girls up there you know who say
you know I'd really like to use that
phone but it's just too big to fit in my
pocket
and it's not just a girl thing by the
way it could be you know with for a guy
too if you wear tighter clothes or if
you have clothes with smaller pockets
but definitely is an issue if it doesn't
in your pocket you know if you're a girl
maybe you put in your purse but I don't
know how convenient that would be but if
this size isn't an issue for you or if
you just get over it but you know I'm
telling you once you use the phone for
about a week or two you really do start
getting used to it and you know when you
go back to another phone the other
phones will actually feel small and feel
like it's smaller than it should be but
anyways when people ask me you know why
I used to note2 over all the other smart
phones that I have I tell them you know
two things yeah more than two things you
just put two main things one is the fact
that the battery on this thing is
amazing I mean with the big phone comes
a big battery it's a thirty one hundred
million battery and I don't ever have to
worry about this thing dying on me and
you know some of my other smart phones
you know I would either have it die on
me I'd be worried about it dying on me
by the end of the night and with this
thing you can have a forty five percent
battery at four o'clock in the afternoon
and I won't really have to worry about
it which you know it's really nice I'm a
heavy user and that's something that I
definitely definitely you know
appreciate in the phone now the second
thing is probably the more obvious one
and that's the big screen I mean having
a big screen like that is really awesome
obviously it could be a drawback but it
could be a huge literally benefit in the
5.5 inch HD screen
watching you know videos or browsing the
web on the screen this big is just you
know better than anything you could have
on you know I spun with the smaller
screen size because this for example if
you're watching a YouTube video like
this one for example and you want to
watch it with a friend or our family
member you know you can just kind of gap
it around the phone and everybody will
be able to see what's going on on the
screen where if you have a smaller
screen size it's a little bit hard and
thankfully the speaker here is actually
good too so it only adds to that
experience now besides the battery and
the screen size you know this probably a
dozen other features that I really like
but if I were to go into a mall the
video would be way too long so the main
one I want to cover is TouchWiz now if
you follow that channel you probably you
know are wondering why I say that
because I'm generally a fan of the pure
Android experience but I really Samsung
really adding some value with TouchWiz
on the note 2 there are certain features
that I really appreciate it and you know
the top ones I'd say is one is the
messaging app the messaging app I really
like because it gives you the option to
schedule future text messages so for
example it's really really great for
sending a text message on its own
birthday at midnight another thing is
the alert repetition which is really
good for me at least because sometimes
when I get a text I don't check it right
away and then I end up beginning to
check it later
because it's the phone just in my pocket
and with this alert repetition it'll
basically you know do the same
notification you know I add a set
interval which I I think I've mine on 10
minutes basically every 10 minutes it'll
vibrate and you know make my ringtone or
sound my ringtone
and until I actually go in and check it
and it ensures that I don't miss text
message it was great because I've missed
a lot of text messages in the past
speaking of alerts another feature that
I really like is the smart alert feature
so for example with smaller a few
different phones are sitting down on a
desk and you want to pick it up and go
what it does is your unread text message
it will actually vibrate so there's no
need to actually look at the screen and
you know turn it on every time you check
you pick up your phone or you're not
going to sit there and wait for the LED
notification light to come on which you
know I found to be really convenient if
my phone throw in my pocket if I don't
feel it vibrate at all if it does
vibrate I'll check it you know I don't
have to check it every single time which
is a pretty big convenience and then the
other thing I have to say that's among
the top of my list for Samsung TouchWiz
features is the ability to hide apps now
you might say you know you could just
uninstall an app that you don't need to
remove your gonna hide it you might as
well install it and I kind of get what
you coming from
where you coming from but personally
there's sometimes there's an app I'll
use maybe only once a month but doesn't
necessarily mean I want to delete off my
phone being able to hide it now has
allowed me to consolidate my app pages
to down to two pages which makes it a
lot easier to find you know what I'm
looking for in these two pages and
whenever I need the app that I hit I
guess you know unhide it and it comes
right back on no need to download it
again
no needs to depend on that data
connection which you know it's really
nice so I'm really convenient and adds
to that great experience now the one
feature on here that you know it's
marketed heavily by
Samsung is the S Pen and honestly you
know it's not bad at me it's actually
really good it works really well we're
just like you'd be expected to but
honestly I don't use it I mean I've had
this phone for a couple of months and I
think it uses like two or three times
two times I used it because I trying to
explain something to somebody and they
weren't quite getting me so I just kind
of drew it and you know I was able to
get that message across really clearly
which is pretty cool and the one other
time was actually signed a contract on
the phone I was in Las Vegas for CES I
signed a contract on my phone and said
I'm happy now you know worried about
printing it faxing it doing the
old-school way then all my phone pull
the S Pen did his signature on the
acrobat sent it back for your email and
I was done so really cool I don't know
if that's the future I'd go out of my
way to you know buy a phone for but
having it you know doesn't hurt and the
S Pen doesn't get in the way at all I
mean if you don't want to use that spend
you just leave it in there and you'll
never even notice it now I've talked
about you know a lot of things that
alike with the phone obviously I like it
more there's more things that like
button I just like but I do like to give
you know some of the negative feature
negative things about a phone in my
reviews and the one thing I have to say
you know I already mentioned is the size
I mean it is a big phone and it is it
does take some getting used to and
personally you know what I found out
when I've used the phone for an
extensive amount of time for like 45
minutes or so or longer my hands start
to get a little bit cramped up and that
might be because I wanted a keyboard all
day at work and you know might be
contributing to that but I haven't
really had it happen with other phones
so definitely something worth mentioning
but other than that you know I have to
say I'm pretty happy with what Samson
did with the note to me it's got the
quad-core processor 2 gigs of ram and HD
screen that's huge great a big hustle
camera it has LTE NFC boosters for
window removal battery a micro SD card
slot so I mean it has pretty much
everything that I'd want in the phone
maybe the only thing I'm saying other
than the size that the drawback is the
plastic design not really you know I've
never been one to really complain about
Samsung's
passi designs and at this point they're
kind of known for it but I dropped my
phone recently and it got a little
scuffed Morgana's like from like one
foot up I was like on a chair and I fell
down on a on cement and it got scratched
which you know so my other poems' even
like the iPhone 5 hasn't done that so
that's a downside but if you don't
really drop your phone not that big of a
deal but yeah I mean those two drawbacks
are definitely something to consider but
I think that the pros heavily outweighed
the cons would be no - at least for me
personally now that's the thing with
phones it really comes down to personal
preference and you know it matters
what's important to you if the size is
too much for you to deal with then
obviously this isn't the phone for you
but you know that's not to say that the
phone can't be improved - and I'm sure
the note 3 there's a lot of things that
Samsung's gonna be able to do but that's
it that's how it is with all the
technology I mean technology moves at
such a fast rate and of course it could
be an HD screen I mean right now this is
a 720p screen there's HD screens Full HD
screen should I say as 1080p I'll you
know the Galaxy s4 is just around the
corner but the thing about the note 2
and for example comparing to the galaxy
s4 or any other galaxy s phones is that
it's a completely different breed of a
smartphone I mean they're not in the
same like segment the note 2 you know
confers you that half tablet half
smartphone experience with the s-pen you
know if you're one to use it it really
changes the whole dimension of the phone
and you know that's something to
consider when you look in the note 2 you
can't really compare it in the same way
as you would you know the galaxy s4 and
the HTC One but that's pretty much it
for me in this video if you found it
helpful or if you liked it please give
it a thumbs up it really helps me out a
lot and subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already for more mobile
technology videos just like this alright
guys I'll see you guys the next video
