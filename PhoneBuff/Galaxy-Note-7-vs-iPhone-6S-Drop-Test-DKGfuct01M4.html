have a drop test between the samsung
galaxy note 7 and the apple iphone
success now if you've seen the drop test
we did on the galaxy s7 earlier this
year you know that because of its all
glass body it didn't do too hot
obviously the note 7 also has an all
glass body but the difference is the
note 7 is packing Gorilla Glass 5 which
cording says can survive drops from 1.6
meters up to 80% of the time using our
professional drop test machine we're
only dropping it from 1 meter first on
this back then on this bottom third on
its side and the big one right on its
face and if it happens to survive it'll
enter the bonus round where we'll drop
it over and over again until it can't
technically make a call with that said
let's go ahead and get right into it
round number one back drop three two one
alright so with this metal back the
iPhone 6s performs just like you'd
expect it to suffering only a few minor
scratches and scuffs but the main story
here is the glass back on the galaxy
note 7 no it didn't come away unscathed
but a huge improvement over what we saw
on the galaxy s7 with you back of the
note 7 only suffering damage along these
bottom sides of the phone with it
cracking and shattering a bit right
where the glass curves over so better
than the s7 but nowhere near the iPhone
giving the nod to the success in round
number one round number two bottom drop
three two one
both on suffer only a few small scuffs
after that bottom drop with the note
sevens damaged looking a bit worse
mainly due to its darker metal band it
is worth noting however that this drop
did add to the damage on the back of the
note with the glass now having
spiderwebs going all over so that's in
addition to the more visible scratches
gives the slight edge to the iPhone in
round number two round number three side
drop three to one neither device
suffered too much damage after that side
drop with really no separation between
the two so it's a draw in round number
three round number four face drop three
two one okay so both bones crack after
that face drop but the differences
denote sevens cracks are nowhere near as
noticeable as the cracks on the iPhone
success in fact when you run your
fingers over the note sevens damaged it
doesn't feel like the glass will cut you
the way it does on the iPhone
most of the note sevens damage came to
its corners again right where the glass
curves over so it seems like the curves
are really the weak point on the note 7
the iPhone 6s on the other hand took the
majority of the damage on the bottom
right corner and as you can see it looks
a heck of a lot worse with the damage
spreading more violently across the rest
of the screen so while neither phone
comes away with a display fully intact
the note 7 Trump's the success here
getting the nod in round number 4 bonus
round
alright so both devices made it through
all four rounds so they now enter the
bonus round where they'll be dropped on
their face over and over again until
they can't technically make a phone call
the iPhone success took not one not two
but five additional drops to the face
before it gave out so the question is
will denote 7 be able to beat that mark
and if so by how much let's find out 3 2
1
I think it's still working and it is
good nice but I just beat the I'll
actually what magic is this whoever is
getting pretty banged up on the edges
but the screen itself is fine and
abracadabra wizardry oh god I've done
something nothing
I'm impressed mass it's all glass it's
all friggin glass water yep
oh we're seeing some damage finally Oh
Len you're flat we don't know the
suspense the suspense nope so good all
right all right
number 32 will it beat the HSC in the
bonus round I don't know okay
gimme a workout man 43 I'm certain sweat
buys more you made all the way buddy
five more fifty you got fancy for this
last one
you got fan smell good okay so the note
seven survives a whole 50 face drops in
the bonus round and despite the size of
the phone being completely shattered and
the display itself having a few streaks
going through it the screen is still
100% functional which is pretty damn
impressive
especially considering that its brother
the galaxy s7 couldn't even survive one
additional face drop so there you have
it the note seven beats the iPhone 6s in
this drop test becoming the third most
durable phone we've ever tested that is
it for me in this video thank you guys
for watching and as always I'll see you
in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
