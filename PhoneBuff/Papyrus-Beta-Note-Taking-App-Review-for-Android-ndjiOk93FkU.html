this video me doing a review on the
papyrus note-taking app available for
free from google play this application
is still in spate of stage and i'm using
it on my asus nexus 7 the reason why i
point out you know what device i'm using
it on is because papyrus actually
requires you to have a resolution of at
least 1280 by 800 in order for it to
work basically meaning tablets or
fabulous i have a galaxy note it won't
work on devices like the galaxy s3
galaxy nexus HTC One X I've already
tried it just says it's not supported at
this time and the second reason why I
point out i'm using nexus 7 is because
my name is seven is a pure android
device obviously so it didn't come with
any pre-installed up note taking
applications and coming from the galaxy
note 10.1 with s note which i did a
review on on a channel by the way really
felt like I was missing something and I
searched google play for you know a
couple of hours until i finally came
across papyrus and as you guys know if
you guys follow the channel I only do
app reviews on applications that
actually use myself on my own devices so
i'm going to show you why i actually
prefer papyrus to some of the other ones
available in Google Play so when you
first open up the application you're
taken to this screen this is the home
screen from here you can create a new
notebook create a new note and go to
your settings so a very simple interface
now notice that it does have the Ice
Cream Sandwich design which is really
nice so on the left column you have your
home which basically is what we're
looking at you go to start notes I don't
have any notes in here so you said you
have no start notes all notes I don't
have any notes on file notes and then
notebooks so i'm going to show you each
of these little options a little bit
later in the video for now I'm just
going to go ahead and create a new note
because this is what you guys want to
see so first thing you'll notice on the
left is to go back to the main menu it
automatically stays when you do that so
I'll open this same note up again right
here at the left of our to the right of
this little papyrus logo you have the
option to name the note so I'll just
name it notes1 hit OK and then you have
your back and forward options so if I
were to draw something something's gonna
hook go ahead and you know drop
something really quick I can just hit
back and goes back to go forward it'll
go for it so pretty simple you guys know
how that works right here you have your
tool selection
so I could choose from my pen I can go
to the selection tool and I go to the
eraser so if I type the eraser it'll
just erase what i have x go to the
selection tool really quick i could
select something like this you just make
a lasso around it basically whoops so
you make a lasso around it and it kind
of gives you that little effect you can
cut cut copy or duplicate say that's one
of two of these exact shapes I hate
duplicate I can move it around now and
then hit done when i'm done and there
you go so pretty cool little tool right
there i want to show you guys the eraser
now there's i like the eraser but then I
don't like it the reason why i like is
because it's really easy to delete or to
raise something so for example I just go
like that and erases the whole line so
basically whenever I do a stroke on here
so you know if I Omega square like this
with one stroke the eraser will raise
all of it if I go like this you know
even reconnect it it won't so go on and
show you that really quick so the eraser
right here place the whole or raises the
whole square right here I have to do it
we know one piece at a time which is you
know bit I don't know I like it because
it makes it faster to raise things but
the same time I don't like it was if
you're trying to draw something and
let's say you know for example I'll try
and draw that square and I kind of
messed up right there right I have a
little bit hanging off I don't want to
erase that and go into the eraser it
deletes the whole thing or you risk the
whole thing so kind of inconvenient but
thankfully there is a way around that
and that's called making the color which
right here is a color picker by the way
you can choose between all these little
colored right over here which are your
basic college or you could you know make
your own one from this color grid and
chooses actually what you want I'm just
going to go to white so because i have a
white canvas i could actually draw over
it like that and basically solves my a
racial problem so that's nice um but I
the one drawback is you can see it right
now my canvas is like a graph paper and
right here where I you know drew the
white over it erases the canvas also I
recovers the canvas up so it's kind of a
solution but the same time is not I
don't know if the developer will add in
the option to have a two different erase
your modes but not that big of a deal
for me right now speaking of the canvas
I'll go ahead and go over here to this
little settings and
page settings and basically what you do
is you can actually change the canvas so
right now you see under page type of
says graph but want to make it you know
like college ruled I hit that hit okay
and boom you can see it's a college
ruled paper background and there's a
bunch of different as you can choose
from you can do a blank canvas college
ruled wide rule narrow ruled and then
different graphs of different sizes so
that's pretty cool next thing is you
from this page settings option you have
the weather the option to choose your
page size so right now it's on infinite
which basically is one of the main
reasons why I really really like this
application but if I wanted different
sizes I could actually choose them from
here for now i'll leave it on infinite
and speaking of infinite so i'm going to
make my color black again on let's say i
run out of room right on most coating it
note taking applications you're pretty
much done you have to create and you
know on here you actually use two
fingers to pan around and you know
continue drawing so this is infinite I
could keep doing this you know for days
and it'll never run out of room which is
really nice now obviously is can be kind
of hard to see you know what you're
doing after a while well you can just
pinch out to zoom and you can see you
know your little creation like that so
that's a cool option not only is
infinite canvas like this you actually
also have infinite pages so say you're
taking notes for like math class or
whatever and you ran our room you don't
feel like you know making your canvas
bigger and bigger because that's going
to make it hard to find what you're
looking for later you'd actually start a
new page so I hit this little arrow
right over here and it starts a new page
as you see it's the graph paper again so
it's not a college ruled or wide ruled
like it was earlier because I didn't
change the campus on it so every campus
has his own setting the default right
now is set to graph I'll show you how to
change that later but anyway I could go
like this start a new page so our new
page and you know if I wanted to make
this one bigger I can do it like that
and as you can see allmore still saved
and if I back out of here you see it
says note 1 i'll tap it and all the more
still there so pretty cool functionality
this is also infinite as well so i
actually put that to the test i went up
always 250 and it didn't stop so i got
bored and stop doing it but take my word
on it is infinite really really cool
functionality here i'll go ahead and go
into
was it what's called the next option aw
you could share so basically in here you
could actually export this canvas or the
whole note together as a PDF so if I
want to do just this page ibis hit share
and basically it lets me share it as a
PDF via bluetooth or gmail really cool
to be able to do that also if you want
to do print something out for example
you don't want to infinite canvas
obviously let's say I wanted a five by
seven hit OK and now this is a five by
seven how could I tell my zoom out you
can see it is a five by seven now it
makes it a lot easier to share it to
email to somebody else like I said I
could do just this page or I can do the
entire know if I do the entire notes
going to share everything so that is you
know what you do from within the actual
note-taking process now from here you
can actually have different options you
could create a new notebook so like I
said let's say you're doing math notes
you would hit create note or create
notebook and math notes and you'd put
the day like day one so math notes day
one I made a little notebook now it's
empty right now so you actually move the
note that i just made into here you
press and hold you see now i can drag it
drop it right into here as simple as
that so really easy to do it's under now
under unfiled notes there's nothing
because I followed it away all notes
obviously is going to appear if I start
this guy it'll show up under start as
well and you know if I unstart it's not
going to show up pretty simple in the
first like I said nothing you know too
fancy here just works now it does
support stylist like i said earlier so
i'll go ahead and show you what i mean
so right here you could actually enable
an active kind so you know if you have
like the Galaxy Note 10.1 you can be
using your S Pen you'll be using an HTC
scribe pen whatever it is so you don't
have to stick with the application that
you know came with your device now what
schools when you have the S or your
active pen enabled your finger touch
will have a different you know input
option so basically right now sets to
the eraser tool so if you're using your
S Pen for example in the Galaxy Note you
could use your finger and it wouldn't
draw on the canvas instead it will erase
because it'd be set to another tool now
if you want to change that you could you
can make it the selection tool you can
make it the erase tool the pencil etc
also if your pen has
you could customize what those buttons
do with the gestures to so i'll go ahead
and show you the gestures really quick I
don't have a pen on me or any kind of
stylus but i'll go ahead and go to these
toil and this actually shows you some of
the little gestures you can make right
here so once you have active pen you're
holding down the side button we swipe up
it'll go to color picker so I to the
right and are to the left it's basically
undo and forward and swipe down it's
tool picker which basically you choose
from your selection tool you're a stool
or your pen so I'll go ahead and back
out of here let's put it back into
portrait mode really quick other
settings you have here like I said you
can change the default page so right now
set to graph like I showed you guys
earlier if I want it to be you know
always a blank canvas I can do that and
you know even the page size I set it to
infinite because like I said that's
really nice to be able to have but if
you don't really like it you can change
it to whatever you want so very very
customizable but also the same time very
simple you know the note the settings
aren't confusing by any means this
tutorial which teaches you everything
you want to do which I showed you
earlier and you can customize the active
pen option so I'm just going to go ahead
and leave the active pen on for a quick
second and you guys can see now my
finger is using the selection tool right
now so my finger is actually not drawing
even though I'm on the pen mode because
it's expecting me to use a stylus so to
undo that of course I have to go back go
back into the settings and uncheck that
but anyways that's pretty much it for
this review on this app I mean if you
want to delete a note you just tap
delete if you want to rename you tap
rename pretty simple um I can even
delete this whole little notebook like
that so anyways that's pretty much it
for me and this review I found it
