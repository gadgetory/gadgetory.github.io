this video I'm going to show you how to
change your contacts so that way they
show up in your messaging app when
you're trying to compose a new message
so right now I have a contact named
phone buff in my phone book and if I
type in phone buff you can see nothing
shows up so I know that that phone book
is in my contact but yeah it's not sure
in my text messaging app and the reason
for that is because more than likely the
phone buff contact is set as it's not a
mobile device so you want to edit it by
finding the contact under your People
app hit edit and then under the phone
number tap it and make sure it's under a
mobile number so I'll put under mobile
hit save hit home and now go back to the
messaging app and I'll open a new thread
now do the same thing phone buff and
guess what it shows up simple as that
honestly I mean it makes sense from the
point of view of Microsoft you know if
it's a home number you're not gonna be
able to text it anyway but sometimes we
don't organize our numbers the way we
should so this is how you fix it
alright this is a from form of comm
thank you for watching video and don't
forget to visit fumble comm for more
cellphone news reviews and how to's
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
