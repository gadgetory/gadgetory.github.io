and in this video we're comparing some
of the top browsers available for
android from google play
so the browsers are we comparing our
google chrome the stock ICS browser and
dolphin compared to Firefox Opera Mobile
and Skyfire so I'm putting them
head-to-head and basically the winner of
whatever one loads up the fastest goes
on to the next round the loser gets
eliminated and of course these are both
Galaxy Nexus so we have the same
processor the same Ram they're both on
the same Wi-Fi network they both have
all the apps close down the background
and all the browsers have both their
cache and history wiped out so basically
we're getting as univis test as we can
get so first up is google chrome against
firefox so it's kind of interesting to
see these two go against each other
because they're both really popular on
computers or windows so let's see which
one actually performs faster on the
mobile side of things so we'll let it
bumble calm for all the tests here so
phonebook calm right here and phonebook
on where so we'll go ahead and 1 2 3 and
I'll let you know we're trying to finish
this first so you could tell this this
one I was loading by the indicator right
there and the blue bar right here on
Google Chrome can't really see it that
well on camera I imagine so I'll just
let you know so it's already done and
this guy is still loading so obviously
the winner in this case is Google Chrome
and the loser is Firefox so we'll go
ahead and close both these apps out and
go on to the next test which is putting
the stock browser against Opera Mobile
to see which one is faster so again
we'll load up phonebook comm on both
phones so phonebook calm and phonebook
calm I think I have it bookmarked on
this one so phonebook calm yeah so one
whoa what the heck did I type on here so
phone buff dot-com all right so I'll go
ahead and press a go and tap on the
bookmark at the same time so one two
three and let's see which one finished
up
first on this test so the stock browser
populated the logo first but this guy
populated the whole webpage a little bit
faster and there you go so I think the
stock browser finished just a second
before that's a little too close to call
so I'll go ahead and load up another
website just in case I'll load up phone
actually know a little bit another
webpage on here so I'll just click on
this main little news article so what's
happened the same time so one two three
and let's see if we get a clear winner
all right so yeah the stock browser is
finished and this guy's still going so
the clear winner here is the stock
browser we'll go ahead and close it out
so Opera Mobile is eliminated and the
stock browser goes on to the next round
so we'll go ahead and compare now the
Dolphin Browser to Skyfire to see which
one loads up the fastest so again well
load up phone buff calm and it just let
you guys know I did have the flash
disabled on all the all these browsers
because Google Chrome doesn't support
flash so some of these other ones do so
I just disabled it so that way we have
equal test so we'll go to phonebook
common here phone buff dot-com excuse my
horrible typing all right so I'll press
go at the same time one two three and
they're both off and I'll let you know
which one finishes first all right looks
like Dolphin finished first this guy is
still loading and that now it's done
but dolphin definitely finished versus
floors loading up the whole page this
guy actually showed that a finished
first but then I started loading things
up again in the background where dolphin
wasn't doing that so I have to give the
win to Dolphin and sky repair in this
case is eliminated so we'll go ahead and
close these guys out all right so we're
only left with three browsers now and
that's the stock browser the Google
Chrome browser and the Dolphin Browser
and because there's three of them we
can't necessarily put them all
head-to-head so just go ahead and
advance the stock browser over to the
champ sure brown considering that it
does have home-field advantage
we'll and I'll put the two downloaded
apps from Google Play head-to-head so
I'll do Google Chrome against the
Dolphin Browser I went ahead and clear
out the history while the video is
paused so you don't have to worry about
it not being an even test I'll go ahead
and type in phone buff on both phones
and then keep in mind we're only doing
our we only did a one test our one
website on all of these browsers and you
know different browsers could have
different results on different sites so
keep that in mind but hopefully this
does give you a better idea as far as
overall performance with a particular
browser so we'll go ahead and press GO
at the same time so one two three and
they're both off looks like this guy is
done and Dolphin is still loading so
that's a pretty clear victory for Google
Chrome but because we're in the later
rounds I want to be sure that we're
naming the right browser to speed
champions so we're gonna go to NFL comm
which is one of my other favorite sites
so nfl.com one here and F Elcom on here
and we'll try to hit go at the same time
so one two three and if for whatever
reason this one's really done just let
you guys know so the clear winner is
chrome but every reason on Chrome and on
the stock browser basically any of the
Google browsers seems like the button
presses or look like they're a little
bit delayed when I'm pressing them but
that's not actually the case it's just
that uh it just lacks a little when I
hit it but yet it loads the web page
faster especially for Chrome so Chrome's
the winner here dolfin has been
eliminated we're gonna go ahead and
close these guys out and now we're going
to pit
chrome against the stock browser so
because I use Chrome on this browser I'm
going to use or I use Chrome on this
phone
I'll me just come on this guy cuz I
already cleared the history out on it
and I'm just going to use the stock
browser on this guy so that way I got to
pause the video again so both phones
have the history and cache cleared out
we can go ahead and load up fumble comm
on each so let's type in phone book calm
and phone book calm all right so I'll
hit each bookmark at the same time if a
cancel one two three and they're off and
it looks like the Chrome browser just
sped through on this one
really fast and I problems I did clear
out the browser history
I don't know how alert oh so fast but
anyway that's the result we got right
there so it looks like the Chrome
browser beat out the stock browser in
this test well go ahead and load up okay
well I guess we can load up that article
cause I already clicked on it we'll load
up a different article a little this one
right here how to transfer files from
your computer to your Android phone so
one two three go
and they're both off and this time the
stock browser actually finished just
before so we'll go ahead now and just go
to NFL comm see if we can settle it on
each phone so NFL comm nfl.com and f-l
dot-com and I could go at the same time
so one two three and again chrome beat
it out here so now let's load up the
full site so let's see if I could go to
the very bottom of each one and hit
desktop at the same time so one two
three and this will give us a better
idea of which one is the faster browser
once and for all and the stock browser
actually finished first so we're getting
kind of mixed results with these two
browsers I mean chrome loaded up NFL's
mobile site faster and phone both faster
you know and I want an article the stock
browser opened up faster on phone buff
and the full website opened up faster on
the NFL site so let's go ahead and try
one more site we'll go to Yahoo and see
if we could get a clear winner out of
these two so Yahoo calm and yahoo.com
alright so one two three and it looks
like this one just opened up immediately
so looks like mobile sites for some
reason to open up really really quickly
on Chrome compared to the stock browser
let's see if that's the same case for
the full web site so one two three
and they're both still going I'll let
you know as soon as one finishes so they
finished around the same time
honestly overall then I'd have to say
that these two browsers seem to be
somewhat tight I mean I can't really get
a clear winner um it seems like you know
one on one test this guy outperform this
guy and vice versa I'll try to load up
one more article if we get you know a
better idea out of it but let's see so
I'll just click on I'll do I'll click on
autos so autos on each let's make it
nice and big so it's easy for me to
click on so autos on both uh browsers
and hit it one two three
see how late the reaction was right
there though that wasn't my finger
pressing late it just happened to be
that way okay so they loaded up around
the same time at least it looks like the
loader at the same time and just tap
this article at the same time okay
that's not an article nevermind let's
load up this article at the same time
and you can see this time looks like
Google Chrome loaded it up first again
that it is the mobile site so you have
to keep that in mind one final test
let's go to another site we'll go to
phone dog calm um they don't have a
mobile version of the site so it kind of
makes it easier to see which one goes up
full web sites faster so go to phone dog
comm right here and hopefully you know
this will give us a better idea because
honestly at this point I'd have to call
it a tie between the two so one two
three
all right so chrome populated and
finished first here and the stock
browser is still going so I'm just going
to give the win to Google Chrome and
honestly that's the way it should be at
least that's the way Google designed it
to be it's supposed to be the faster web
browser and though these two are very
very close looks like Chrome is faster
especially when you're loading up mobile
sites and in this case the overall site
loaded up faster on Chrome as well so
it's going to give it the win and that's
pretty much it for me in this video the
stable calm thank you for watching it
and don't forget to visit for more calm
more cellphone news
views and how to's thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
