this video will show you how to disable
s voice from coming up when you double
tap on the home button on your Samsung
Galaxy s3 so as you can see if I double
tap this guy as far it's going to come
up so the way you actually disable is
when you have s voice actually popped up
press the Menu key and then press
settings and then from here it says
launch s voice when you double tap the
home key let's go ahead and uncheck that
guy and it'll automatically disable so
now you can see when I double tap this
car I'll just going at home I'll double
tap it and you can see nothing happens
so that's how you disable it and the
reason why you wanted to stable is
because there's some lack of time
associated with the home button for
example right now I'll show you a
demonstration quick demonstration I
opened up the Google Play Store I'll
press the home button and you can see it
closes pretty much as soon as I tap on
it so again instantaneous so I'll go
ahead and show you the difference when
it's actually enabled so I'll go ahead
and able it really quick in the settings
so let's check this guy back so that's
how you do it in case you have warner
back now again I'll go to the Play Store
and this time press home again and
notice a difference I'll press it and
you guys can see it's about a second of
lag and basically what's happening is
it's waiting to see if you're going to
tap it again to determine whether or not
to minimize the app or to bring up s
voice but anyway that's it from me in
this video we've found it helpful please

you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
