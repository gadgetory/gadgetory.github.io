7 plus is the current home buff style
speed dash champ and to be honest with
you I don't expect that to change here
with it going up against the current
Android speed test champ in the 1+3 but
since these two phones haven't
technically faced off against each other
yet I think it'll be interesting to see
just how much of a difference there is
between the fastest iPhone in the world
and the fastest Android phone in the
world at least until the Google pixel
comes out but before we get into it I
want to give a big shout-out to
Braintree payments for sponsoring
today's video so developing your own
mobile app can be complex but
integrating your own payment option no
longer has to be with Braintree your
business can accept nearly every type of
payment from any device with just one
integration everything from pesos to
PayPal to Android pay and whatever you
payment option comes next
Braintree simple flexible SDKs make your
job and your payments easier learn more

all right let's get right into it
okay so we'll kick things off by
starting Lee stopwatches on each phone
and then jump into the first row of
system apps where the 1 plus 3 just
burst out the gate with it flying
through that first row and already
pulling a full app ahead of the iPhone 7
plus as it starts working on Photoshop
mix but the iPhone is right there behind
it and now in front of it with it
passing the 1 plus and moving on to
lapse it
we're both also will have to create a
time lapse from the same exact video
file so with the iPhone already working
on processing the time lapse the 1 plus
begins about 45 frames behind and as you
can see the iPhone 7 plus and it's a 10
fusion chip only adds onto its lead
finishing a full 85 frames ahead so
things aren't looking so good for the
oneplus with their processing this time
lapse at a much slower rate than the
iPhone did with the iPhone 7 plus
showing no signs of slowing down at all
with it just blazing through this gaming
row finish it up with flip diving and
already working on fit the fat the
oneplus finally finishes the time lapse
and joins the iPhone in the gaming row
where it is a full two apps behind and
from the looks of it the iPhone sevens
lead will only increase here with the
oneplus struggling to load up subway
surfers as the iPhone 7 plus finishes up
with smash it and moves on to Spotify
so as the oneplus 3 start
working on flip diving you can already
see that it's loading the game up at a
much slower rate with the iPhone taking
only six seconds to load the game up
whereas the oneplus takes twice as long
at 12 seconds so it's the little wins in
each app like that that has added up to
the iPhones lead with it finishing the
first stop with the time of 1 minute and
23 seconds now in case you haven't
noticed this speed test has more apps in
it than our previous speed tests and the
reason is with phones like the iPhone 7
plus packing 3 gigabytes of RAM and
phones like the oneplus 3 packing 6
gigabytes of RAM these phones are
capable of keeping way more apps ready
to go in the background and that's
exactly what's being tested here with
the iPhone 7 plus having all the apps so
far ready to go as it looks to do with
the iPhone 6s did to the note 7 and
lapse the oneplus 3 finishing both laps
with the time of 1 minute and 56 seconds
which is five seconds faster than the
oneplus 2 to finish just the first lap
with the time of two minutes in one
second so while this is a disappointing
result for the oneplus 3 it isn't
surprising considering that the iPhone
6s already beat the oneplus three in a
previous speed test but on the bright
side the six gigabytes of RAM under the
oneplus is hood is having no issues
keeping all the apps open which coupled
with the super fast animations helps it
complete this second lap at a faster
rate than the iPhone 7 plus finishing
with a total time of 2 minutes and 25
seconds making the winner and still
fumble style speed test champ the iPhone
7 plus that is it for me in this video
thank you guys for watching and as
always I'll see you in the very next
