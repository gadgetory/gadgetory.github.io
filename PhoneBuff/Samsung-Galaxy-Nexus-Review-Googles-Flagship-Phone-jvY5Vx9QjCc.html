booths calm and today we're doing a
quick review on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
so there's plenty of reviews out there
obviously that's been done on this phone
before the phone's been out for quite
some time and I've had it since November
so i have been using this my daily
driver so i just want to give you you
know quick overview and then just tell
you what I liked and disliked by the
phone so first off the phone has a 4.6
5-inch screen as you may know it's super
amoled it's 720p five max will camera on
the back got your 1.3 megapixel camera
on the front and that's pretty much the
whole want to talk about as far as the
device goes it's up for the hardware I
just want to talk about what I like and
just like about the phone so I'm gonna
start off with what I dislike so I can
end it on a positive note because I do
like this one a lot what I don't like
about it is the speaker the speaker in
here is really really low it just
doesn't have the kind of volume you'd
expect from a flagship bones especially
one like the Nexus that could cost
upwards of you know 300-400 are
especially beginning it a GSM one like I
have that was you know originally
purchased for seven hundred dollars when
I bought it from overseas so anyway this
phone speaker isn't as good as I wanted
to be but it's actually software-related
believe it or not because I've
downloaded app called volume plus and
that seems to a fixed issue it lets me
amplify the speaker and it pretty much
performs the way I expected to at least
like the galaxy s2 and obviously but I
push it too much it'll start to sound
distorted but at least that fixes the
issue but I just really you know would
wish our hope that Google fixes it in a
future update I don't know if they will
but hopefully they do another thing that
I feel like Google needs to fix is the
software as far as the speed the
performance for example when I go to
unlock the phone with the camera are
opening traits at the camera it takes
like two or three seconds for it to open
now that's depending on how many apps i
hope have open if i have a lot of apps
running it might take even longer so
that's something i don't like another
thing is the live wallpaper join here
for some reason or another i have no
idea why it
just kind of stuttered I mean it's not
smooth like it is on the galaxy s2 on
the HTC amaze 4g I'm pretty much any
point I've tried with android 2.3 so far
the live wallpapers are smooth I don't
know why it's just kind of like I don't
know if that's coming through on camera
but it kind of stutters a bit when I go
from page to page now let me give you a
something to compare it to so let me put
a regular wallpaper on here will do the
standard nexus one and you can see now
it's as smooth so definitely makes a
difference I tend to not use live
wallpaper because of that because this
makes me feel like my phone is slow um I
do wish the processor in here was a
little bit faster they underclock it
from 1.5 the for 462 1.2 so they did to
conserve battery life and this is the
gsm version just let you guys know is
the hspa+ the battery on here is
actually really really good but I've
heard a lot of people talk about the
battery on the LTE version for a verizon
and after that the healthy really drains
the battery so a lot of people complain
about about the battery life with the
cdma version but if you're getting the
gsm version um better life is great I
mean it lasts me all day I never you
know have to recharge the phone so
definitely something I love about it
especially compared to my nexus s my
nexus s lasted a lot less than this guy
does um let's see what else do I not
like but Oh another thing that kind of
bugs me about this phone is the browser
whenever I'm loading a web page you know
about half the time when I load it and
it you know as its loading and if I the
articles are showing up and I want to
zoom in the double tap doesn't respond
the way I wanted to so right there you
can see it kind of struggled a little um
how the time it works and a half time
doesn't but sometimes I'll double tap
and it won't register and have to do it
over and over and over until it finally
gets the point and a lot of times are
like this hat like you know twenty five
percent of time if there's a link within
the article it'll click on the link and
take me to the next webpage so that
annoys me but I download a google chrome
and it seems to do it a lot less so you
know if you get a Galaxy Nexus or have
the Galaxy Nexus I'd recommend google
chrome because it seems to do it less
but Google Chrome has some issues of its
of its own so for example if i type in
type it's like you see the the keyboard
kind of lies a little bit and again it
does this how about half the time does
it you know sporadically I can't
necessarily make it our demonstrate it
again but I'm just got to take my word
for it sometimes the keyboard literally
is like a second behind as far as the
letter a' type now i can keep on typing
and it will catch up with it so it's not
like it's not registering it's just not
showing it as being type so again that's
another software thing Google from what
I've heard reports about android 4.0 for
and 4.05 seems like a lot of these
issues wouldn't be fixed but again we
don't have the update yet so I can't say
for sure hopefully that is the case and
that we're expecting it sometime in
april may be may I just really hope I
get it sooner rather than later because
those issues were kind of annoying um
lasting that I don't like what a phone
and you know this is not soft related
there's nothing to do about it it's the
lack of a microSD card I mean there is
no SD card on here so I can't expand my
storage only I'm stuck with the 16
gigabytes I have on the gsm version if
you have the LTE version you're stuck
with 32 but you know that might not be
an issue for you I just like to have the
choice now let's talk about what I do
like about the phone because there's
honestly a lot to love i love the screen
on here the screen here even though it's
not super amoled plus and the Super
AMOLED it is 720p so the resolution is
super high loading web pages on here is
you know fantastic i mean i can zoom out
and still be able to read the text even
like this so that really uh you know is
a plus on on the screen I don't really
notice the sub towel are the pencil
matrix display I mean I don't notice it
hindering the quality everything looks
super super good and I mean I don't know
if they're showing up on camera but it's
super super smooth and this looks really
nice watching HD youtube videos is
really nice on here and also reading
books so if you're going to use a kindle
or playbooks for example you know
reading a book on here it's actually
pretty nice um because of the huge
screen because it's four point six five
inches you know you have a lot of real
estate on here and the high resolution
is makes it even better and you know
reading a book on here I mean honest I
don't feel like
need a kindle with a with a phone like
this now I think about it is you know it
might waste battery life but cool thing
is because this is a super amoled
display what i could do is change the
way the display is to make the
background black so that way i take
advantage of the AMOLED screen that way
I'm only wasting battery life on the
letters and not the white background so
that's what I do pretty much when I read
a book on here and like i said i still
have great battery life so the next
thing i like about the phone is the fact
that it's really sleek i mean take a
look at it you know it's all black
there's no capacitive buttons on the
front it just looks really sleek I mean
that appeals to me obviously everybody
has different tastes the phone is pretty
thin I mean it's not thick at all by any
means the phones up back cover with this
texture is really nice and when they
were so well so is the camera I mean a
lot of people when it first came out
we're talking about oh it doesn't have a
back whistle camera the iphone has
America's camera I'm happy with the
camera the camera takes really good
pictures it records in 1080p my videos
come out looking awesome on the front
facing camera is 1.3 megapixels and
records in 720p so that's something you
have to consider because a lot of the
new phones coming out they have you know
vga cameras in the front facing camera
and it doesn't look as good as you know
this one does so that's another thing
that like about it I also like the fact
that you know everything on the phone is
a stock Android you don't have to worry
about blood where you do not to worry
about things slowing you down for no
reason and I one of the best things
obviously of having a Nexus device is
that your promise to have the update at
least three months or so ahead of time
or before other phones get it so you
know I've had this phone since November
have been on been running on ice cream
sandwich and it's almost April and you
know there is no phones out there on the
market that have ice cream sandwich
there's been a few phones have been
updated you know worldwide but you know
for the most part most people are
running on gingerbread so definitely
something to consider when you're
looking at this phone if you're
considering purchasing it you know I I
mean overall i recommend it now there's
gonna be better phones out there as far
as hardware goes i know that the HTC is
coming out with the One X and the 1s and
those have the Snapdragon s4 processors
and
I mean those pauses beat this guy out I
mean benchmarks at least so far show
that and you know I really don't feel
like the processor on here especially at
one point two gigahertz is going to be
able to compete with those but you know
that's only one aspect of it and the
performance increase might not be that
great I think by the time the galaxy s3
comes out or the the next Nexus you know
it might be a more significant jump so
as of right now I still consider buying
this one you know how to make the
purchasing decision again I'll buy it
again because you know I'm that happy
with it I just hope that the update like
i said earlier fixes the issues of the
volume of the lagging and the camera
opening and then the browser but if
those things can be resolved overall
give this mon a thumbs up and definitely
recommend it alright that's it for my
