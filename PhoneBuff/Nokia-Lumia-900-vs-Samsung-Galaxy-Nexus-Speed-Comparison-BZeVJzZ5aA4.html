this video I'll be pitting the flagship
foam from Google which is the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus the unlocked HSPA+ version
against the flagship phone from
Microsoft representing Windows Phone
which is the Nokia Lumia 900 from AT&amp;amp;T
so both of you guys are off right now
and be doing a speed comparison test I'm
gonna put them both up so we do a boot
up test but also booting them both up
fresh make sure that there's nothing
running in the background so we get a
nice even test they're both running on
the same Wi-Fi network so without
further ado I'll go ahead and turn these
guys on so press the power button at the
same time hold them for a few seconds
there you go and I will go ahead and let
these guys load up and that way we can
see which one loads up faster so as you
can see the Galaxy Nexus is up in its
boot up animation the Lumia 900 is going
through its little splash screens for
AT&amp;amp;T showing the Windows Phone load up
and there you go you can see it says SIM
card error because I don't have a SIM
card in this guy but it's already up and
running
so definitely the winner here is the
Lumia 900 while this guy is finishing up
with Mazal show you I'm also gonna be
doing app speed comparisons so imma be
loading up the ESPN Flixter dictionary
and WordPress apps I'm also gonna be
loading up the cameras phone so
basically v app speed test I'm of course
gonna be doing a browser speed
comparison to see which one loads up
websites like phone buff and you know
New York Times knows that faster alright
so this guy's done we'll give it a
minute or you know a few more seconds to
load up everything in the background and
we'll go ahead and lock it now alright
so we'll go ahead and do the app test
first and then we'll finish it off with
the browser test so like I said they're
both on the same Wi-Fi network so we're
getting us even those tests as possible
we'll go ahead and load up
score Center right here first so we'll
tap it at the same time one two three
and there you go you see the Lumia 900
loaded up the app first were you know
already into it and we're able to browse
around and there you go now the Galaxy
Nexus and Android finished up so we'll
go ahead and close out of these the
winner again of this speed test is the
Lumia we'll go ahead and open up another
happen you know what close the apps in
the background and ROI because I know
they run in the background and Windows
when they pause but I'll close my on
Windows Phone too just in case I'm so
that way we're getting you know a true
comparison test you know with you know
being as fair as possible so we'll go
ahead and load up the next app which is
Flixster so one two three again the
Lumia 900 beat out the Galaxy Nexus here
and we got to add in the Galaxy Nexus
but even before we got the add this guy
loaded up but that was a pretty close
one it wasn't as big of a difference as
it was on the ESPN app so even though
this guy got the one it wasn't that bad
for the Galaxy Nexus obviously these
guys are both really fast phones go
ahead and close out the app on here and
we'll close out the app on there we'll
load up the next app which is dictionary
so get my dictionary app open and where
is it are there a one two three and
again it opened up first on the Lumia
900 again this one's really close just
like the Affleck strap with this open it
maybe half a second faster than the
Galaxy Nexus but it was a clear winner
so we'll close this guy out I don't know
why I keep doing I should press back
instead on here we'll close it out
and the last app though I'll run is
WordPress so this is what I used to you
know manage my blog on phone buffs so
we'll go ahead and press this guy at the
same time and this one is actually a win
for the Galaxy Note so got its first win
in this speed comparison test and it's
actually pretty impressive you think
about it because this guy only loaded up
the website for phone but I should have
to click it and then loads up the same
things that it does over here so this
one actually went a step further and
actually loaded up faster so the wind
goes to the Galaxy Nexus I'm actually
not gonna make the same mistake again
and while back out of here and close
this guy out like that and last app I'll
do is the camera so I'll
lift this one up so you guys could
actually you know see oh there's nothing
behind here but hopefully it gives you a
better idea of the camera loading so one
two three and loaded up first on the
Galaxy Nexus so Galaxy Nexus one there
that one's really close and you know my
own testing I've seen you know sometimes
in Lumia 900 when sometimes the Galaxy
Nexus wins it just really depends honey
you know how the phone is running at the
moment but for this test the Galaxy
Nexus one that so so from the five apps
are loaded ESPN went to the Lumia
so did Flixster soda dictionary but the
camera and WordPress went to the Galaxy
Nexus over here so pretty much three to
two series for the apps obviously the
boot up test went to the Lumia 900 but
now we'll go ahead and look at the
internet browser and we'll see how fast
each phone loads up the websites our
websites on the Internet
now obviously this guy's a 1.2 year
dual-core processors TI OMAP 4460 this
guy's running a 1.4 giggle core
Snapdragon processor so I expect the
Galaxy Nexus to beat out the Lumia here
because you know while Windows Phones
efficiency could really make up for the
single core processor when it comes to
loading up apps I don't think it's gonna
be able to compete with the sheer
processing power of the Galaxy Nexus
when it comes to loading up websites but
you know who knows we'll go ahead and
test it out so we'll go to foam buff
calm for the first one I mean why
wouldn't I go to phonebook right so foam
buff calm and we'll do foam buff com1
here sorry for my slow type I'm trying
to type you know behind the cameras kind
of tough anyway
phonebook balcom make sure to have them
right phonebook home both will hit go at
the same time if I can so one two three
and they're off and the Lumia 900
actually has a lead right now if you
look at the little status bar right here
it's about like 60 percent done now the
Galaxy Nexus is done though so it looked
like this guy had a lead but this guy
just caught up in like one second
obviously this guy's done I'm zooming it
out this guy's still loading but it just
hasn't loaded up some of the ads and
stuff most of the content has been
loaded so obviously the win goes to the
Galaxy Nexus here let's go ahead and go
ahead and do a quick multi-touch kind of
test so you guys can see how smooth our
on unsmooth it is so I'll go ahead and
zoom in and out on here on the Galaxy
Nexus pretty smooth I mean actually it's
really smooth out you know very little
lag we'll go ahead and scroll up and
down well that's not a good example well
scroll up and down so you guys can see
we're not getting those like little
check boards which means that everything
is running really smoothly on here go
ahead and do the same thing on the Lumia
so again really really smooth on here
just like it was on the Galaxy Nexus and
load it up like this and again this
one's really smooth no checkbox or check
board little things so both of these
guys you know definitely are gonna give
you a good browsing experience Galaxy
Nexus is a little bit faster on our
first test we'll go ahead and load up
another test so I'm not gonna do a foam
buff actually know what I'll go to NFL I
always go to NFL typically both phones
will go to the mobile site so nfl.com go
there you go so I in this case it looks
like the Lumia and 901 but it's actually
loading up a different version
this one's loading the WEP version this
one's loading the mobile version there's
no pictures on this so obviously it was
gonna get the win so that's not really a
fair test we'll go ahead and go to the
desktop versions and this one will give
us a better idea
I want to make it a little bit bigger
and make it easy on myself to actually
tap on it so one two three all right so
this one will be the true test to see
which phones browser loads up faster the
icon right here are the loading bars
down here on the Lumia it's up here on
the Nexus it's done on the Nexus and
that this guy's still going so you see
the Nexus is done loading for the most
part now this guy's done too obviously
both um haven't loaded up all the
background images but you can see on the
Nexus now most of them are loaded up
this guy's still catching up but it's
gonna get those little thumbnails soon
so anyways obviously the browser is
faster on the Galaxy Nexus than it is on
the lumia 900 so and overall I mean both
these guys really
phones you know just going through him
for example I'll just press home at the
same time okay that was horrible I'm
sorry didn't hit home well we'll go
right back to the browser I just want to
show you like I feel like jumping in and
out of things is a lot of fast from the
Lumia you know for example I hit home
there the one in will go into for
example my contact so actually going to
like an app like calculator so load up
calculator on both phones calculator and
ass about the same so anyway
intensive speed comparison test I trying
to get sure you guys a difference
between them but I guess it's not gonna
work right now basically what I feel
like is with the Lumia 900 you know
going through in and out of the system
there's on Windows Phone everything runs
really quickly and smoothly you know I
don't notice any lag at all the Galaxy
Nexus is pretty fast you can see some
stuttering right there with the
animations but again you know with that
dual-core processor everything runs
pretty smoothly on here as well
obviously the attribute test the edge
goes to the Lumia 900 browser speed test
goes over to the Galaxy Nexus and the
boot up is a little bit faster on here
but you're not really putting up your
phone all that much so pardon app that
big of a deal for most you guys but it
overall I would say I don't know I call
it a draw
Galaxy Nexus is faster for web browsing
if you care about web browsing you know
go with the Galaxy Nexus if you care
about just the apps and stuff how fast
those run the Lumia 900 can give you a
better experience but anyway that's
pretty much it for me in this video went
a lot longer than I originally planned
but thank you for watching if you found
it helpful if you liked it please hit
the like button it helps me out a lot
and subscribe to my youtube channel to
look forward to more reviews news and
how to's on these phones I'm gonna be
doing a review on the Lumia 900 very
soon and also be comparing this guy to
the iPhone 4s but anyway it's it from me
in this video thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
