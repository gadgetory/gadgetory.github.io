and in this video I'll be pitting the
flagship phone from google which is the
Samsung Galaxy Nexus the unlocked hspa+
version against the flagship phone from
Microsoft representing windows phone
which is the nokia lumia 900 from AT&amp;amp;T
so both of you guys are off right now
and be doing a speed comparison test i'm
a boot them both up so we do a boot up
test but also booting them both up fresh
make sure that there's nothing running
in the background so we get a nice even
test they're both running on the same
Wi-Fi network so without further ado
I'll go ahead and turn these guys on so
press the power button at the same time
hold them for a few seconds there you go
and I will go ahead and let these guys
load up and that way we can see which
one loads up faster so as you can see
the Galaxy Nexus is up in its boot of
animation the Lumia 900 is going through
its little splash screens for AT&amp;amp;T
showing the Windows Phone load up and
there you go you can see it says sim
card error because I don't have a sim
card in this guy but it's already up and
running so definitely the winner here is
the Lumia 900 while this guy is
finishing up with muscle show you i'm
also going to be doing ab speed
comparisons some be loading up the ESPN
flixster dictionary and wordpress apps
i'm also gonna be loading up the camera
phone so basically five apps be test I'm
of course going to be doing a browser
speed comparison to see which one loads
up websites like foam buff and you know
New York Times needs that faster all
right so this guy's done we'll give it a
minute or you know a few more seconds to
load up everything in the background and
we'll go ahead and lock it now all right
so we'll go ahead and do the app test
first and then we'll finish off with the
browser test so like I said they're both
on the same Wi-Fi network so we're
getting us even those tests as possible
go ahead and load up scorecentre right
here first so we'll tap it at the same
time one two three
and there you go you see the Lumia 900
loaded up the app first where you know
already into it and we're able to browse
around and there you go now the Galaxy
Nexus and Android finished up so we'll
go ahead and close out of these the
winner again of this speed test is the
Lumia we'll go ahead and open up another
app and you'll close the apps in the
background and Roy because i know they
run in the background and windows when
they pause but i'll close my windows on
two just in case i'm so that way we're
getting you know a true comparison test
you know with you know being a spare as
possible so we'll go ahead and load up
the next app which is flixster so one
two three again the Lumia 900 beat out
the Galaxy Nexus here and we got to add
in the Galaxy Nexus but even before we
got the add this guy loaded up but that
was a pretty close one it wasn't as big
of a difference as it wasn't the ESPN
app so even though this guy got the one
it wasn't that bad for the Galaxy Nexus
obviously these guys are both really
fast phones go ahead and close out the
app on here and we'll close out the app
on their will load up the next app which
is dictionary so get my dictionary app
open and where is it are there a 1 2 3
and again it opened up first on the
Lumia 900 again this one's really close
just like the flick strap with this
open-air maybe half a second faster than
the Galaxy Nexus but it was a clear
winner so we'll close this guy out I
don't know why I keep doing I should
press back instead on here we'll close
it out and the last app though i'll run
is wordpress so this is what I used to
you know manage my blog on phone buff so
we'll go ahead and press this guy at the
same time and this one is actually a win
for the galaxy nurse so got its first
one in this speed comparison test and
it's actually pretty impressive you
think about it because this guy only
loaded up the website for phone but I
should have to click it and then loads
up the same things that it does over
here so this one actually went a step
further and actually loaded up faster so
the wind goes to the Galaxy Nexus i'm
actually not gonna make the same mistake
again i'm all back out of here and close
this guy out like that and last appt
i'll do is the camera so I
lift this one up so you guys could
actually you know see it was nothing
behind here but hopefully gives you a
better idea of the camera loading so one
two three and loaded up first on the
Galaxy Nexus so galaxy nexus one there
that one's really close and you know my
own testing I've seen know sometimes in
lumia 900 win sometimes the Galaxy Nexus
wins it just really depends on you know
how the phone is running at the moment
but for this test the galaxy nexus one
that so so from the five apps are loaded
ESPN went to the lumia so did flixster
soda dictionary but the camera and
WordPress went to the Galaxy Nexus over
here so pretty much three to two series
for the apps obviously the boot up test
went to the Lumia 900 but now we'll go
ahead and look at the internet browser
and we'll see how fast each bone loads
up the websites or web sites on the
Internet now obviously this guy's a 1.2
year dual-core processors TI OMAP for
460 this guy's running a 1.4 gig a
single core I Snapdragon processor so i
expect the Galaxy Nexus to beat out the
lumia here because you know while
Windows Phones efficiency could really
make up for the single core processor
when it comes to loading up apps I don't
think it's going to be able to compete
with the sheer processing power of the
galaxy nexus when it comes to loading up
websites but you know who knows we'll go
ahead and test it out so we'll go to
foam buff calm for the first one I mean
why wouldn't I go to phone book right so
phone book calm and we'll do phone book
on one here sorry for my slow type I'm
trying to type you know behind the
cameras kind of tough anyway phone book
draw comic sure captain right phone book
home both will hit go at the same time
if I can so one two three and they're
off and the luminometer actually has a
lead right now if you look at the little
status bar right here it's about like
sixty percent done now the Galaxy Nexus
is done though so it looked like this
guy had a lead but this guide is caught
up in like one second obviously this
guy's done zooming it out this guy's
still loading but it just hasn't loaded
up some of the ads
stuff most of the content has been
loaded so obviously the one goes to the
Galaxy Nexus here let's go ahead go
ahead and do a quick multi-touch kind of
test so you guys can see how smooth are
on unsmooth it is so i'll go ahead and
zoom in and out on here on the Galaxy
Nexus pretty smooth I mean actually
really smooth out you know very little
like we're going to scroll up and down
well that's not a good example well
scroll up and down so you guys can see
we're not getting those like little
check boards which means that everything
is running really smoothly on here go
ahead and do the same thing on the Lumia
so again really really smooth on here
just like it was on the Galaxy Nexus and
load it up like this and again this
one's really smooth no check box or
check board little things so both of
these guys you know definitely are going
to give you a good browsing experience
Galaxy Nexus a little bit faster on our
first test we'll go ahead and load up
another test so i'm not gonna do phone
buff actually know what i'll go to NFL i
always go to NFL typically both phones
will go to the mobile site so NFL com
hey go there you go so I in this case it
looks like the Lumia 900 one but it's
actually loading up a different version
this one's loading the WA p version is
imploding the mobile version there's no
pictures on this so obviously it was
going to get the win so that's not
really a fair test we'll go ahead and go
to the desktop versions and this one
will give us a better idea want to make
it a little bigger and make it easy on
myself to actually tap on it so one two
three all right so this one will be the
true test to see which phone's browser
loads up faster the icon right here are
the loading bars down here on the Lumia
it's up here on the Nexus it's done on
the Nexus and that this guy's still
going so you see the Nexus is done
loading for the most part now this guy's
done to obviously both of having loaded
up all the background images but you can
see on the Nexus now most of them are
loaded up this guy's still catching up
but it's going to get those little
thumbnails soon so anyways obviously the
browser is faster on the Galaxy Nexus
then it is on the Lumia 900 so in
overall I mean both it has a really
phones you know just going through him
for example I'll just press home at the
same time okay that was horrible I'm
sorry then hit home well we'll go right
back to the browser just want to show
you like I feel like jumping in and out
of things is a lot of fast from the
Lumia you know for example I hit home
there it went in will go into for
example my contacts so actually going to
like an app like calculator so load up
calculator on both phones calculator and
uh us about the same so anyway um
constant speed comparison test I trying
to get sure you guys at the difference
between them but I guess it's not going
to work right now basically what I feel
like is with the Lumia 900 you know
going through in and out of the system
their song windows phone everything runs
really quickly and smoothly you know I
don't notice any lag at all the Galaxy
Nexus is pretty fast you can see some
stuttering right there with the
animations but again you know with that
dual core processor everything runs
pretty smoothly on here as well
obviously the attribute test the edge
goes to the Lumia 900 browser speed test
goes over to the Galaxy Nexus and the
Brit up is a little bit faster here but
you're not really putting up your phone
all that much so probably not that big
of deal for most you guys but overall I
would say so I don't know I call it a
draw um Galaxy Nexus is faster for web
browsing if you care about web browsing
you know go with the Galaxy Nexus if you
care about just the apps and stuff how
fast those run the Lumia 900 can give
you a better experience but anyway it's
pretty much it for me in this video went
a lot longer than I originally planned
but thank you for watching if you found
it helpful if you liked it please hit
the like button it helps me out a lot
and subscribe to my youtube channel to
look forward to more reviews news and
how to's on these phones I'm gonna be
doing a review on the Lumia 900 very
soon and also be comparing this guy to
the iphone 4s but anyway it's it from me
in this video thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
