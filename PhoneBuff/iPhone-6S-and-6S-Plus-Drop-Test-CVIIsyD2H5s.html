6s and the 6s plus are made with a
stronger 7000 series aluminum and what
Apple is claiming to be the strongest
glass on any smartphone so we're here to
put that claim to the test let's go
ahead and get right into it
alright so for the first drop we're
going to be dropping the iPhone 6s on
its back with this wooden platform to
help get more consistent drops
alright so yep pretty much no damage the
only thing you really see is a little
bit of scuffing right along the top
right not sure if that's coming through
on camera but also it works we're good
to go alright so next drop is for these
6s plus we'll be doing the same backdrop
again just a little tiny chip mark right
there but for the most part looks pretty
good you know it's not going to be too
disappointing all right so the back
drops are relatively easy so we're going
to take it to the next level and do a
side drop alright so after that side
drop you can see there is a little bit
of a chip mark at the bottom right of
the phone and does look like the
headphone jack is a little bit bent but
other than that looks pretty good
alright so same test for the iPhone 6s
plus and alright so as you can see with
the 6s plus you are have a Dem mark
right over here but the good news is the
screen is still working just like it is
on the success so now it's time to go to
the hardest test of them all which is a
face front drop and I will start off
with these 6s
so uh the screen did crack unfortunately
but it is still working and I have to
say you know what compared to last
year's result this cover glass does look
stronger all right so the 6s did get a
screen crack on the last test let's see
how the iPhone 6s plus does so we do the
same thing drop it on its face pretty
much same result you have a lot of
cracking actually on the top right
corner this place still does work so the
fact that display works at least you'll
be able to make an emergency call if you
needed it in like a worst case scenario
but you're not gonna be able to use this
phone long term all right so while the
new iPhones do look like they're more
durable than their predecessors to be
honest the phones are still gonna break
if you drop them so if you don't want to
risk throwing 700-plus dollars down the
drain you definitely want to get some
protection and to help we've teamed up
