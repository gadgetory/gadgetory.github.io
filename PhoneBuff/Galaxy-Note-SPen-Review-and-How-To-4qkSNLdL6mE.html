and in this video we're doing a quick
how-to slash review of the s-pen that
comes with the samsung galaxy note so as
you can see I have the ATT version of
the galaxy note here and on the back you
have the option to pull the S Pen out so
I'll go ahead and do that and show you
what the pen itself looks like and as
you can see it looks like you would
expect the stylus to look like of course
you have the Samsung logo right over
here but what differentiates this stylus
from the other ones is one you have this
button right here they can actually
click in and out which gives you
different input methods or options when
using the touchscreen itself and I'll
show you that later in the video
and two you have this tip on this on the
S Pen which is different from your
typical rubbery one that you see on
capacitors Tallis's and this offers you
better precision when using the s-pen
and also gives you 256 different levels
of pressure sensitivity so I'll show you
that in the video as well so let's go
ahead and unlock this guy and I'll show
you some of what the S Pen offers you so
first thing I want to show you is just
how it works as a stylus a normal stylus
and of course you can see I could use
the iPhone just like you normally would
I could bring down the notification menu
I could press home very accurate very
smooth works perfectly just like you'd
expect it to just like your finger does
so that's a you know the basic feature
of the s-pen but the other ones I want
to show you they actually make it unique
is some of the things they can do so for
example if I press and hold on the home
screen right now you're gonna get your
typical long press menu that you do with
Android which is expected but if I press
the and hold the button on the S Pen so
I'll go ahead and press and hold this
guy and do the same exact thing by
pressing holding on the home screen you
can see this time
it took a screen shot but not only does
it take a screen shot it automatically
opens up an editor in which you can
start drawing on this screen shot and
then you could save it or I'm sorry
share it via text message email Facebook
whatever Android offers you you could
set it as your wallpaper you could print
it if you have a printer connected of
course you can save it and you have a
few
any options to the top so I was go ahead
and draw something say for example I was
making I wanted to show a friend how to
open up the Play Store a quick how-to I
could actually just draw an arrow like
that you know color in really quick and
you know I could just go ahead and send
it to him and that way they'll get the
picture as far as what I wanted them to
do so pretty cool functionality doesn't
just work on the home screen it works
anywhere so you press and hold while
holding the S Pen button on any
application whether it's Google Maps
whether you're on the browser on a Play
Store I mean it doesn't really matter it
works and I'll automatically open up
this functionality so go ahead and hit
cancel for right now and I want to show
you some of the other features so I'm
going to open up Play Store since we're
talking about it one option that you
have with the S Pen is you press and
hold on this button right here and you
swipe up it actually brings up the Menu
key as if I were to press this menu guy
right over here and if I do did it again
it'll actually make it go away so pretty
cool functionality right there but
wanted to press the back button instead
of having to reach all the way down here
I can actually press and hold the button
and swipe to the left and as you can see
takes you one step back so definitely
pretty cool option now another option
with the a button is if I double tap on
the screen normally of course nothing
happens but if I double tap on the
screen what regardless of what
application I'm in while holding the S
pen's button you're gonna get this
little pop-up and this is what Samsung
calls S Memo light so I spin my white is
just a little notepad and it lets you
make a quick note so if I wanted to say
hi just like that I can do so I can even
edit the pen settings right over here
which is pretty cool I can change the
color and whatnot let's go ahead and
save on this guy and it'll automatically
be added to the S Memo app so I go ahead
and open up the S Memo app and I'll show
you some of the other features within
the app and about the pen so here's that
note that I made I'm really quick I want
to show you the different pressure
sensitivity of the pen so I'll go ahead
and make a line lightly touching the
screen going down so there's a line you
can see how thin that line is so I'm
gonna make a similar line right over
here but this time I want to apply a
little bit more pressure so there you go
so you can see
this one's clearly thicker than this guy
I'm hard to use my finger would
different pressure so I'll go ahead and
make two lines with different pressure
it literally came out exactly the same
so it doesn't detect you know my finger
as far as pressure sensitivity goes but
it does detect the pen so that's
definitely you know a cool feature again
like I said there's 256 different levels
of pressure sensitivity so you know you
can only imagine what you could do so go
ahead and actually hit this little plus
sign right over here at the bottom to
show you the stack option that the S
Memo app has and what it does is
basically say you're taking notes you
know whether you're in a class or a
business meeting and I took those notes
but it's on the same meeting or the same
class and I wanted to have more space
you press the plus sign and you can
continue taking your notes I'll go ahead
and hit save and show you what happens
so it says save memo stack I wouldn't
hit save and I as you can see the right
over here and it's one set of notes yet
there's two pages so you could you know
I have all your notes for one particular
meeting or class in one spot so
definitely a cool functionality I'll go
ahead and go back one step and you know
that's the S Memo app you could of
course add another one by pressing this
guy over here whether you want to draw
something or add text I'm going to open
up this guy real quick and edit it show
you some of the editing features too so
you have of course the pen which I
showed you earlier you can make it
thicker or thinner so let's make it
thick and show you you know what it
looks like so you see I've made it a lot
thicker of course you can change the
colors and there's a few other options
you have to but you have the eraser
right over here so I'll go ahead and tap
on the eraser and you can see I could
quickly you know erase a mistake that I
made just like you would with a regular
notepad and you can also add text so
normally you could type in you know what
you want so I could write you know hi
like this but what's cool is you can
press this button right here on the
keyboard and it's a it's a little T with
a pen next to it letting you know you
can enter text with your pen so right
here you have a little drawing pad so
you could actually do handwriting it'll
convert it to type in so for example
let's say I wanted write high I could do
that again and it typed in high now
notice that the casing is both
lower case over here because I tied our
I wrote it in lower case so it's a chai
this time to make is face by the way you
you drag over to the right and it makes
a space we wanted to go back one and
delete you go back but anyway I'll go
forward and I'll make a capital age this
time with the lower case I and you can
see that the phone recognizes it this
time the I actually got two capitals I
don't know if that's my bad handwriting
let's go ahead and try it again
you know this towel right 2h is so age
and then age whoops let's go ahead and
back out of here and give it a fresh
start so capital age and then lower case
age and you can see right here it's not
sure what we're trying to say because it
doesn't make sense of with two H's but
it does give you the suggestion right
here if you wanted to type it in so
there's that like I said you could
delete it by going back so definitely
cool functionality you don't have to
press the button on the S Pen in order
to be able to go forward and back using
that feature so anyway I'll go ahead and
hit cancel on this guy and uh whoops hit
cancel and I'll go home and last thing I
want to show you is just that you know
practical use say for example I was in
my browser and I wanted a copy and paste
text now copying paste is a great
feature obviously that's been on andhra
for a long time but i don't know about
you i've struggled a lot with it and
let's say i'm trying to copy and paste a
specific sentence you know my fingers
this seem to be a little bit too fat but
with the stylus because it's so thin at
the tip i could actually copy exactly
what i want so if i wanted to copy this
sentence I could literally copy exactly
I don't want letter by letter what
perfect precision and if I wanted a copy
of course you just hit copy and paste it
from there but that's pretty much it on
the s-pen I've really enjoyed it
I I really like it I really like the
fact that it's not just a stylus it has
a lot more features different
sensitivity you know the button gives
you different options Samsung did say
that they release the apk or the SDK to
developer soap we don't even know what
developers will come up with as far as
functionality for this s-pen alright so
that's pretty much it on the s-pen and
this video one thing I do want to show
you before I go though is that the S Pen
actually doesn't work with other
capacitive touch means so here's my
Galaxy Nexus also made by Samsung and
you can see no matter what
do it just doesn't work with my
touchscreen I've tried a whole bunch of
different cell phones and doesn't work
so it's made to work you know
specifically with this type of screen
that Samsung has on the Galaxy Note so
that's definitely something that you
know you might want to know but like I
said that's it for me in this video if
