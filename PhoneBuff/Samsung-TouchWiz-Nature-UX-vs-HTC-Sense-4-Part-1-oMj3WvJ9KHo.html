in this going to be doing a comparison
between Samsung's TouchWiz UI against
HTC Sense for user interface to see
which one comes out on top and also
which one's best for you the reason why
I'm doing this comparison though is
because a lot of times both these
manufacturers put out absolutely great
phones like the HTC One X and the
samsung galaxy s3 which are similarly
respect so it's hard to choose one over
the other and ultimately it come down to
the software that comes shipped with
each device so that's the reason why I
be doing a comparison between these tu
is I'm comparing them in 10 different
categories and giving you advantage that
each you why has that the other one
doesn't and at the end of the comparison
for each category i'm giving you the
winner and the end will tally it up to
see you know which you i actually comes
out on top so with that said let's go
right into the review alright so the
first category i'll compare between the
tu eyes is the lock screen so i'll go
ahead and take a look at TouchWiz first
so going to lock the screen and unlock
it first thing you'll notice is these
application shortcuts here at the bottom
you have four room which you could
actually customize to be whatever you
want and unlike on sense they could be
completely different from what shows up
on your application dock right over here
we're on sense you know the ones that
show up on your lock screen have to be
the same as what shows up on your
application dog the next advantage is
you have the ability to show you whether
and have a new sticker as you guys can
see on the bottom at the same time
showing your news or stocks pretty cool
since has that ability to do it
separately but I'm not at the same time
and the last advantage is you can unlock
the screen from pretty much anywhere I
mean I could swipe over here and unlock
it and I could swipe it from over here
and unlock it and pretty much you know
anywhere I want also if I put a static
wallpaper instead of a live wallpaper
you have that little water ripple effect
which is pretty cool but anyway that's
the advantages that this guy has avoided
show you some of the different features
that the sense UI actually gives you
with the lock screen so go ahead and go
to the personalized tab and then the
lockscreen styles so as you can see you
have the photo album effect you have a
Productivity effect you have a different
scene for french stream
whether people extender so you have a
bit of more options which is nice but
like I said if I wanted the news I have
to choose just the stocks alone if I
wanted the weather I have to choose just
the weather lung can't really combine
the two which is a downside but if you
guys like for example photos I'll go
ahead and leave that to one I have right
now i unlock my screen and my photos
will automatically pop up so pretty cool
a little effect there but overall the
advantages of TouchWiz actually
outweighed that advantage on sense so
the win here goes to TouchWiz so the
official score so far is 120 alright so
the next thing we'll compare is the home
screen so again we'll start with
TouchWiz so the advantages TouchWiz has
here is one you can scroll from any home
screen by simply sliding so obviously
you're going to have a lot of home
screens on your phone you can add in you
know delete as many as you want just
like it could on sense but the
difference is if you're using the phone
one-handed instead of having to go like
this to a go through your screens you
can actually tap over here and slide
over just like that so you can see
sliding it over from screen to screen
actually is really easy on here and the
next thing is you can actually change
wallpaper or pressing holding on the
home screen just like that so you can
change your home screen lock screen or
both wallpapers and also you get add
shortcuts just like that so pretty easy
to do on sense though you actually have
the ability to make folders just like
you would on Ice Cream Sandwich so you
could actually you know drag and drop
folded on top on top of one another to
make folder you can't do that on
TouchWiz even though that's the Ice
Cream Sandwich future another thing is
you could actually add widgets right
from you know your home screen by
pressing and holding and actually it's
really easy on sense so for example I'll
go to this home screen really quick and
delete this widget because I have no
room so I'll delete this guy and then
we'll add a widget so you guys can see
you know there's a bunch of winners I
could choose from much more than you'd
find on the TouchWiz UI and also there's
a lot more wallpaper so that's another
advantage but I'm going to go ahead and
add a calculator widget and al our data
from HTC you could actually order them
you know whatever way you want i'll just
do calculator got my calculator widgets
tap on this guy and boom it's added so
really easy to add widgets definitely a
nice advantage and like i said because
there's more home screens our home
screen wallpapers and widgets the edge
goes to HTC sense in this category
because I do like that a lot more so now
the official scorer is actually one to
one we'll go ahead and go on to our next
test which is the notification bar so
we'll go ahead and compare both
notification bar this is actually pretty
easy the notification bar is just like
it is on ICS I mean not just like it is
as far as looks but functionality you
have your settings button and that's
pretty much it we're on the TouchWiz
user interface you scroll down and you
have wireless toggle over here you have
eight of them or not or 10 of them
should i say so you have 10 or 99
wireless toggles that you can turn on
and off like screen rotation i really
like Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS things like
driving mode and things like that so
it's pretty cool you have the same
settings option but easy one for touch
was here so now the official score is
two to one and the next category is let
me take a look at my notes really quick
is the app drawer so the app drawer on
both these phones are pretty similar
when you tap on these this little icon
right here and you get treachery apps
but unlike on sent on TouchWiz you have
the widget just like it is on ICS you
have to tap up here to do it the
advantage is that TouchWiz has in this
area is it's easy as sliding from home
screen again are from apps cream to app
screen so with one-handed use it's going
to be a lot easier another thing is you
can actually uninstall your apps in bulk
so you tap menu and uninstall and I just
tap the little minus icon kind of like
it is on the iphone to uninstall apps
just like that which is pretty cool
another thing that you could do on the
TouchWiz UI is go to view type and for
example I can make it a list instead of
a grid but you know I prefer the grid so
I'll go ahead and back to grid and that
last thing and this is probably my
favorite feature is you could actually
hide application so we move this guy out
of the way you tap on hide applications
and I could hide anything i want so for
example let's say i don't use this game
hub which comes pre-installed in the
phone i'll just check on it hit done and
boom it it disappears of course if i
ever wanted to unhide it I said show
hidden applications you can see I've
already hit a whole bunch especially
those tmobile bloatware apps to come on
the phone you can hide them a little
absolutely awesome feature um haven't
seen this before but I absolutely
so because of that the wind does go to
TouchWiz again here so the official
score after this is 34 TouchWiz and 14
cents let's go ahead and go to the next
test which is the camera alright so the
cameras on both these phones are pretty
good obviously but the software is
really different um on TouchWiz the only
thing that really stands out to me is
the fact that you could customize the
little shortcuts that show up here so I
can hit settings and hit edit shortcuts
and pretty much you know customized for
example if I don't want this thing over
here I could actually are I'll just grab
one here and replace it like that so
cool little feature but that's pretty
much it as far as any you know special
effects go that touch our sense doesn't
have but sense obviously you have a
bunch of features one you have the
ability to take easy bird shot so you
press and hold on this instead of having
go through the settings like you would
on touch with another thing is you have
the ability to take a video right from
here so you don't actually have that you
know hit settings and go to video mode
or switch to the little suit or flip the
little switch and set you just tap that
guy and take take you straight to
recording a video so it's a lot quicker
another thing is you have easy access to
zoom or Auto flash so I can just tap on
it like that instead of going through
the settings again and the last thing is
you have slow motion video in here so if
you go to the effects you can actually
record the slow motion video and that's
really cool on both phones don't have
time lapse for some reason but at least
the HC has slow motion video which is a
absolutely cool you just you just hit
the record button you can see the little
icon changed as a little guy running in
slow motion so the win here goes to
sense obviously and the official score
is now 34 TouchWiz and 24 cents let's go
ahead and go on to the next category all
right so that category is multitasking
so let's go ahead and open up the
multitasking tabs on both of these guys
and as you can see on the TouchWiz UI is
pretty much like it is on Ice Cream
Sandwich you know it's you can scroll up
and down and if you want to close an app
you just tap our swipe it to the left or
right which is like it is on ice cream
sandwich or jelly bean but the cool
thing on TouchWiz is you can hit removal
and it will close out all your
also you have access straight to your
task manager right from that screen
we're on the sense UI you're all you
really have is the ability to close your
apps and have to swipe up you can't
swipe them down only up and honestly it
takes a long time to do this way even if
I didn't use the remove all feature here
so I bring them to the side considering
how big the screens are the you know the
site isn't that long compared to the
length of it going up and now this
actually takes a long time I feel like
act like drag my finger all the way to
the top of screen too close and so
advantage goes to TouchWiz here so the
official score after this is 44 TouchWiz
and just 24 sense so far
