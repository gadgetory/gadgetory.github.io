we're checking out the freshly updated
Opera Mini browser for Android so there
are a ton of mobile browsers out there
ranging from the stock browser and
chrome to Firefox and operas full
browser but what makes Opera Mini
different is how it serves up the
webpages you visit on your phone so for
example when you type in a website or a
click on a link using Opera Mini your
request is first sent over to opera
servers which then retrieves the web
page processes and compresses it on the
server itself and then sends the
compressed version of the web page back
to your phone
this results in claimed data savings of
up to 90% and since you're technically
shrinking down web pages to as little as
10% of their original size it can also
lead to loading web pages faster
especially when you're on a weak data
connection in our use operas claims of
saving up to 90% on data usage we're
pretty spot-on with one of our browsing
sessions using just seven megabytes of
data instead of the 112 megabytes of
data we would have used had the browsing
session not been compressed and that was
after a single browsing session so over
a period of a month it can lead to a lot
of saved data which could be a pretty
big deal if you don't have an unlimited
data plan now while all this compression
technology is great it does come with
some cost with some of the websites we
tested not displaying 100% properly and
interacting with web sites like opening
a menu requiring a back and forth
between the phone and opera servers
which could get a little bit annoying
but for the most part the experience is
similar to what you get on other mobile
browsers except for you getting the
benefit of compression as far as other
features go Opera Mini has mostly
standard features you'd expect like
private tabs a search on page option and
the ability to hold the back button to
quickly jump a few pages back without
having to press the back button over and
over again but where Opera Mini differs
is the start page which opera calls
speed dial that not only gives you quick
and easy access to your favorite
websites but also has a news feed for a
number of different topics that you can
choose from similar to how blinkfeed and
my magazine work you also have the
option to search Google Wikipedia Amazon
and ebay on the fly directly from the
address bar and when you scroll up and
down a webpage you have a little button
pop up that makes it easy to go to the
top or the bottom of that page with a
single tab while there isn't a way to
request the desktop version of a website
the new and cleaner-looking UI on Opera
Mini does include the option to
customize the browser's layout from the
classic layout that makes for easier
one-handed use the phone layout for
maximizing your viewing area and B
tablet layout for easily switching
between tabs which is a pretty nice
touch
so while overall I think the Opera Mini
is a great app to have in your app
arsenal I wouldn't necessarily say it's
my browser of choice when I have a
strong and unlimited connection like on
Wi-Fi but in those situations when your
data connection is weak or when you need
to save on data usage it's a pretty
useful app to have now before I leave
you guys I want to tell you about
something that you may be excited about
which is that opera is sponsoring a
giveaway right now for a brand new
Samsung Galaxy s6 exclusively for fans
