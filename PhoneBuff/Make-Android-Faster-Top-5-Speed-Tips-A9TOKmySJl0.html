calm and in this video i'm giving you my
top 5 tips for making your android phone
run a little bit faster or at least make
it feel like it's running a little bit
faster so the first thing and probably
the most effective thing that you do to
make your phone feel faster is to
disable the transition animation so for
example if i hit on this app right here
you can see there's a little transition
and that actually adds up over time I
mean there's just milliseconds but over
time you get to be uh quite a bit of
time so the way you disable it is press
menu and then go to settings and then go
to display under display you'll see an
option for animation just hit no
animations and then watch I might hit
home and look how quickly it goes so
basically now I hit the same file to my
files and you can see getting rid of
that animation this makes the phone seem
like it's a little bit faster now that's
on the Galaxy Note with Android 2.3 but
on a phone like the Galaxy Nexus which
has Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich you
disable the animations a little
differently and also the ice cream
sandwich you have the option to not
disable it outright if you don't want to
but you can actually speed them up so
the way you do that is again you go to
settings but this time you go under
developer options so developer options
right over here and now before I do this
actually let me show you the animation
so you can see there is animations I go
to my contacts it's doing the whole
little animation transition and it takes
up some time so anyway go back here
you're going to go to developer options
again and then you're going to scroll
down to where it says window animation
scale and transition animation scale so
you can see it's set to 1x now you could
actually make it go to 0.5 X which is
you know half the time so that's what
I'll actually do because I do like the
animations are the transitions because
it does make it look a little bit you
know nicer but it is a little bit slower
so now when I when I press home you see
it's a little bit quicker at doing it
which you know I could live with now
that's the first tip the second tip to
making your phone a little bit faster is
getting rid of widgets that you don't
necessarily need or use
now a lot of people will have their you
know seven home screens on their iPhone
and have a widget on all of them and
really you're not going to be using all
of them you can see I have some widgets
now these ones actually like in
considering my phone has one gig of ram
I'm pretty okay I'm okay with the UH
with the widgets but you know sometimes
if I want to get a little bit more speed
I'll just delete them right off my phone
so to delete them for example if I want
to delete some of these I just pressing
home when I press and hold on it and
drag up or down to delete it and there
you go so pretty easy to do and it
speeds up the phone a little bit now you
may have noticed that on my phone that
you can see is kind of lagging a little
when I go from home screen to home
screen um and that's the next step or
the next tip which is to disable your
live wallpapers now live wallpapers look
cool you know you can interact with them
like that and that's nice and all but
not only do they waste battery life they
also sew it on your phone so I'll go
ahead and disable this guy and put a
different wallpaper now if you have an
AMOLED screen I would recommend also to
see what a battery is using a darker uh
wallpaper so for example this one has
some black in it let's go ahead and use
this guy hit home really quick so
there's some black at the bottom on top
which you'll see some battery because
AMOLED screens turn off the pixels for
those and now you can see the smoothing
is a lot or the scrolling is a lot
smoother and now my phone just feels
faster already
now the next two tips are one to close
your apps so you know always you know
hit the multitasking button on ICS or
the task manager in closing out now a
lot of people will you know say oh you
don't need to do that
Android manages your apps by themself
and they'll close them out you know when
it thinks that it's necessary when it's
running low on system resource and
that's true I still give in the habit of
closing them but if you don't close them
then at least I'd recommend you know if
you have a whole bunch of apps that you
know when you first got your pone yours
having fun and downloading a whole bunch
of apps you know delete the ones that
you don't use because a lot of times
those apps will have you know will be
running in the background will take up
your RAM will take up some processing
power and you won't even know it and you
don't use it there's no point to have it
kind of similar to like a widget um and
my last tip is to every once in a while
just reset your
phone now I know that you don't really
have to do this but you know I do it at
least you know once a week or so I just
turn my phone off and turn it back on it
just clears out the RAM refreshed it
just like on a computer you know you
restart it it's gonna run faster same
thing with the phone but after those
five tips I mean you should be okay and
your phone should be definitely running
a lot faster than it was before all
