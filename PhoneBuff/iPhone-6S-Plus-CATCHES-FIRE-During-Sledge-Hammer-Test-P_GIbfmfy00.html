a while since we've done a video like
this as many of you know starting back
in 2012 when we had just 10000
subscribers we did a bunch of phone
destruction videos where we ran phones
over with the car smack bones with a 2x4
and often use this very knife and mallet
to test a phone's durability and we'll
do a little bit of stabbing but it's
2016 now a lot of change that foam buff
I should our tools so we're gonna be
upgrading the knife to a machete and the
mallet to a freaking sledgehammer let's
get right into it
all right so test number one is
scratching the back of the iPhone 6s
plus with this machete on both sides as
a serrated side so we're gonna see how
this aluminum back actually fares are
you ready all right have a little fun
chop it up oh god oh man let's take a
look at that some pretty deep scratches
as you kind of expect look at that one
does that look pretty but I think I
think you think it to get a little bit
more alright so this is the test I'm a
little bit worried about because I run
the risk of cutting off my own finger
so as careful as it possibly can I'm
gonna go into the side of the phone and
hopefully nothing crazy happens alright
does not sound pretty ooh glittery give
your iPhone a free and paint job
alright so the phone is working that's
because we haven't touched the front yet
that's to come later but right now we're
checking out this new custom paint job
got glittery design right there all you
need is a jagged knife or machete and
you could get that look but it looks
pretty cool honestly I wouldn't mind I'd
rather have this in like a crash phone
alright so enough for the freaking games
right you seen scratch test before
you've seen I don't know if you've seen
a freaking jagged edge like that before
but we're going to go ham on this we do
a karate chop I only took a few karate
classes when I was a kid but I think I
can manage this a full chop straight
down on the iPhone with a freaking
machete you ready all right
Oh
all right so stronger aluminum or not
the iPhone 6s plus still bends if you
slam it with the damn machete but but
despite its bend and that line going
across the back it still works and you
know that means don't allow you know
what that means
hammer time all right so here's our
friendly volunteer for the video he's
excited he's never destroyed a phone
before and he's gonna start with the
damn sledgehammer we'll go ahead and
back up good all right we're ready let's
see if I can hit doesn't a first try
don't miss the table is gonna break
alright yeah oh my god
you
Oh
my god oh my god look at the table oh my
oh my god look at the glass wait
Oh God on your first try yeah Congrats
alright so let's take a look at Jays
handiwork and as you can see
surprisingly the phone doesn't work this
is so unexpected the front-facing camera
is gone look at that oh my god I saw at
that point impact I don't know where the
point of impact so I'm assuming this
right here cuz the glass just freakin
flew off back I mean my handiwork it was
okay I look the phone working but Jay
just destroyed it
see that sapphire glass right there not
cracked not cracked at all and let's
take a look at the side you know once it
looks like it's on all its gonna say
it's a little bit less bends but
actually a little bit it looks like you
flattened out a bit I I think I kind of
fixed look at that it was a I feel like
goes more bent than this before so if
you want to fix the bent iPhone you
could do that with a sledgehammer now
with that said I don't know if this
phone's done because it still looks like
an iPhone to me and I don't like that so
let's do something to change it alright
so we've slashed chopped and hammered
this poor iPhone 6s plus but we're not
done yet
it's still technically in one piece and
as you know when it comes to these type
of videos our goal is to completely
destroy the phone so with that said
let's keep going ready
oh my gosh
oh my you ever wanted to know what the
inside of an iphone looks like I was a
good hit that was a good hit
oh I think it's missing
come on Jay Oh
GoGet Oh
Oh more one more
oh gosh oh oh oh hey oh my good at the
fire extinguisher all right so taking a
look at the slow-mo that last smack
caused glass and metal to fly in every
direction and then something crazy
happened the phone just started to smoke
up which I've only seen happen a few
times before in other videos but what
really caught us by surprise was the
fact that the phone went from smoking to
fully catching on fire which is
something I've never seen happen to an
iPhone by simply hitting it you can see
the fire slowly expanding the iPhone
like cookies in an oven with more and
more of its electronic guts just flying
out absolutely crazy let's take a look
at what the phone looks like after the
fire alright so I'm not going to be
using my hands I'm gonna using the tools
of the trade 2012 tools 2016 tools let's
take a look at the 2015 I phone and as
you can see my god I don't this doesn't
look like an iPhone to me I guess how it
does on the back oh it's still freakin
hot whoo oh my gosh so Jay hit it once
didn't look pretty
Jay hit it again and the phone look like
is about to give out and in the third
time the third time was the magic strike
went on fire and Jay ran away look like
a little girl
oh oh now Jay ran away he didn't want to
put himself in danger it's not worth it
but oh my god let's see listen let's
take a closer look at the camera lens is
cracked this whole like left side where
the volume rocker is is missing I go
into that go what are the vault oh oh I
found the volume rocker guys
it's right there this iPhone if you
could call that anymore it's done I mean
it I guess it's pretty safe it's it's
it's either well done or it's toast
you don't know whatever catchphrase you
want to give it the thing is done I just
love the crunchy sound crunchy crunchy
okay so the house one of the craziest
phone destructions I have ever seen it's
not often that you see an iPhone combust
like it did but with that said thank you
