calm and in this video I will show you a
little trick you can use while you're
doing a video chat on Google Talk to
actually share videos that you have on
your device with a person you're doing a
video chat with so I'm go ahead and show
you how to do it I'm gonna start a video
chat really quick hit accept I'm gonna
hit the meet buttons really quick on
these phones cuz otherwise it will annoy
the heck out of me we'll go ahead and
set this down really quick over here and
there you go so basically this is
pretend I'm just doing a video chat you
know with this little Android guy so
what you're gonna do is actually tap on
your you know picture right over here
with your camera to make it big you're
gonna get these options here at the
bottom you're gonna want to tap on the
one with the picture so that way it says
background replacement and then choose
pick from gallery now note that not all
Android phones are gonna have this the
Galaxy Nexus had it with Ice Cream
Sandwich the Nexus 7 tablet has it and
obviously the Galaxy Nexus still has it
with jellybean so this check your phone
to see if it has it but I know not that
not all of them do anyway if you have it
hit pick from gallery and then choose a
picture so I'm just gonna choose this
little video right over here and the way
you do it is basically pretty simple
just cover the front-facing camera with
your thumb make sure you hold it nice
and steady
because it needs to steady background
otherwise it's gonna use the background
you know video function to make it look
like you're on top of it but anyway you
can see I'm sharing this video you know
with hypothetically the Android guy down
video chatting with so if I wanted to
record myself or show my face again I
can just take my finger off the camera
and back to regular video chat go back
and press like that so Ryan it looks
kind of weird because I have those
high-powered lights on all I think the
video ended but I had those high-powered
lights on so it doesn't work as good as
does in you know regular situations but
definitely something that's really cool
and I've used it with people out of
state you know showing them video funny
videos or you know interesting videos
while I'm doing a video chat with them
this is a great way to do it instead of
having to actually email the video over
a lot of times the videos are you know
too large and I you know it doesn't
really fit in the context of the
conversation anyway that's it for me in
this video if you found it helpful
