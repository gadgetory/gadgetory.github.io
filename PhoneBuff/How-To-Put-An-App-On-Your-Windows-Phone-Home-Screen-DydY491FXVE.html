basic thing on windows phone and that's
how to pin an app to your Start screen
so I have a whole bunch of apps pinned
also got some toggles it's pretty cool
but I'll go ahead and show you how to
pin an app so let's say I wanted to pin
this translator something I use a lot
not really but this is safe I did you're
gonna press and hold on it so you're not
gonna click it you know press and hold
until you get a little pop-up and you
have three options written review
uninstall and pin to start obviously my
hit pin to start and you can see it's
been added and once it's been added to
your screen you can actually move it
around if you want by pressing and
holding and I can unpin it by hitting
this little guy right here or I could
you know move it around to to a location
I want so say I want to put it right
there and the other apps will just move
out of my way and then once you're done
just hit the start or home key and
that's it this is Dave fumble if calm
