bucks you wouldn't really expect to one
plus six to have a whole lot of reasons
on why it can be considered better than
the thousand dollar iPhone 10 you would
think that like okay it's cheaper and
that's its main advantage yet here we
are today now with five not even with
ten but twenty five reasons on why it
could be considered better now of course
the iPhone ten is still a thousand
dollar smartphone okay so like obviously
there's gonna be a bunch of strong
reasons on why someone would want to
spend the extra money and go with it
instead and I'll be listing twenty five
of those reasons to keep things nice and
fair at the end of this video but the
main focus here is gonna be on the one
plus six and on the reasons why it could
be considered better than a phone that
costs nearly twice as much let's get
right into it glass breaks but with
rhino shield your phone doesn't have to
big thanks to Rhino shield for
sponsoring today's video and for hooking
you guys up with a special discount on
both their crash guard case which
protects your phone from drops of at
least eleven feet without hiding its
beauty and on their solid suitcase which
with Ronald shows focus on Android
phones is finally coming to the one plus
six click on the link down below and
make sure you use offer code foam buff
to get your discount reason number one
price so we already touched on it but
it's worth repeating the one plus six is
a lot cheaper than the iPhone ten which
means one of two things you can either a
keep that extra four hundred and seventy
dollars in the bank or be spend the same
thousand dollars but instead of getting
just a phone you can get a phone a smart
speaker a smart watch and even Apple's
own air pods to level up your whole Tech
game to bigger screen the oneplus six
has a 6.2 inch display compared to the
5.8 inch screen on the iPhone which
makes doing things from scrolling
through Instagram to playing games or
watching videos just that much more
enjoyable three faster performance as of
right now the one plus six is the
fastest smartphone we've ever tested
with it being able to easily outperform
the iPhone
in our tests thanks largely to its
massive amount of RAM which allows you
to keep more apps open and ready to go
for you when you need them for
split-screen multitasking taking
advantage of its bigger screen and all
that extra RAM the oneplus six lets you
run two apps on the screen at the same
time for a better multitasking
experience reason number five fast
charging adapter
unlike the thousand dollar iPhone 10 the
oneplus six actually comes with the fast
charging adapter in the box
something that Apple wants to charge you
an extra $70 for six faster fast
charging now even if you do spend the
extra money to buy the adapter and a
cable that you need to get fast charging
on the iPhone it's still a slower
version of fast charging compared to the
oneplus with the one plus six getting a
60% charge in 30 minutes compared to a
50 percent charge on the iPhone 10/7
fingerprint scanner the fingerprint
scanner on the oneplus 6 lets you unlock
your phone a lot faster than you can
with base ID on the iPhone 10 which
considering that you unlock your phone
over 80 times a day over the course of a
year or two it can make a really big
difference 8 headphone jack unlike the
iPhone 10 the oneplus 6 still has a
headphone jack
meaning you all have to ditch your fancy
headphones or carry around an adapter 9
invisible knotch love it or hate it both
of these phones have not but at least
with the 1 plus 6 you actually have the
option to hide the notch if you want to
while still having the statusbar take
advantage of the extra screen real
estate reason number 10 battery
percentage icon speaking of the status
bar on the 1 + 6 you can actually see
where your battery percentages with just
a glance whereas due to the notch in the
smaller screen on the iPhone 10 get the
swipe down control center every time 11
app Locker the oneplus 6 as a feature
called a blocker that allows you to
password protect any app of your
choosing to give you an extra layer of
privacy on your phone 12 screen off
gestures with gestures the oneplus 6
lets you take quick actions in the phone
when the screen is off
for example swiping on the screen with
two fingers came quickly pause our play
your music and with five other
completely customizable options you can
set things like drawing in as to jump
straight into the selfie cam drawing a B
to toggle the flashlights or drawing an
o to launch into Instagram
thirteen quick camera launch with the
double press of the power button from
anywhere or any app you can quickly
launch into the camera so you will have
to fumble around looking for the camera
icon during one of those Kodak moments
14 File Manager on the one plus six you
actually get a real file manager
compared to the limited one that you get
on the iPhone which not only allows you
to manage the folders and files on your
phone like you would on a computer but
you can also drag and drop content from
your phone onto your computer when you
connect it along the phone to
essentially double as a USB flash drive
reason number 15 navigation buttons
while the Wampus six does have an option
to switch to a gesture based navigation
style like on the iPhone 10 it still
comes with a standard option of buttons
for back home and reasons which in
addition to just being more familiar to
Android users the buttons also come with
the advantage of being customizable so
you can set things like a long press of
the back button to turn off and lock the
screen or have a double tap the home
button bring down Notification Center 16
multiple users with support for multiple
users you can create a completely
separate user account for someone like
your kid so you can install the apps and
games that your kid wants on their own
profile and keep all of their stuff
separate from your profile so that way
you can just hand them your phone
without having to worry about them
getting into any of your emails or texts
and you can even prevent them from
making phone calls 17 default apps you
can set your own default applications on
the oneplus 6 allowing you to
permanently replace a system app with
any app of your choosing for example if
you decide that you'd rather use
Firefox's in main browser instead of
chrome well on the 1 + 6 you can do that
whereas on the iPhone Apple doesn't
really let stuff like that fly 18 LED
notifications when your screen is off
and you have a missed notification the
iPhone doesn't really do anything to let
you know but on the 1 + 6 you have a
physical LED light that will blink to
let you know if you miss something with
just a glance 19 parallel apps with the
parallel apps feature you can log in to
multiple accounts for apps like Facebook
Instagram Skype and snapchats which
could be useful if you use one account
for like personal use and one account
that you use only for work reason number
20 dual SIM speaking of work with the
dual
card option you can have two separate
phone numbers on the 1 plus 6
whether it's one for work and one for
personal or for situations when you're
traveling and you just want to pop in a
local SIM card 21 gaming mode with
gaming mode on the 1 plus 6 you can
optimize your gaming experience by not
only blocking those annoying
notifications but also boosting your
network speed by limiting the usage of
the network by your other apps 22 alert
slider the 1 plus 6 is one of the few
Android smartphones that have a vibrate
switch like the iPhone has had since day
one but oneplus actually took it a step
further by including not just the option
to switch between ring and vibrates but
also having the option for complete
silence with media volume muted and with
the vibrations disabled 23 just like an
iPhone 10 the oneplus 6 can record a 240
FPS slow-motion video at 1080p but
unlike the iPhone the oneplus 6 can
record even slower slow motion with an
option to record video at 480 frames per
second at 720p 24 dark mode the oneplus
6 has a dark theme that turns the UI in
most system apps completely black which
is not only easier on your eyes
especially at night but it can also save
some battery life due to the AMOLED
display and no I'm not gonna count the
smart invert option on the iPhone 10 as
a dark mode since it makes all the other
ABS just look weird and finally reason
number 25 free accessories the oneplus 6
comes with a screen protector factory
pre-installed straight out of the box
and you know as if that weren't enough
oneplus also includes a case in the box
sure the case is kind of flimsy and
probably doesn't offer the best
protection out there but hey it's free
and at the very least it's nice to have
as a backup option and if you want more
solid protection you can go with
something like the Rhino shield which
can protect from drops of at least 11
feet okay so there you have it those are
25 reasons why the oneplus 6 could be
considered better than the iPhone 10 of
course like I said in the beginning
there are still some really strong
reasons on why you'd want to spend the
extra money to go with the iPhone 10
instead some of my personal favorites
are the dual speakers which give you
both richer and fuller sound 3d touch
which makes the process of editing
texts and interfacing on the phone
easier software updates that come not
only more frequently but also for many
years longer the fact that iOS tends to
get new apps first and sometimes even
better versions of those apps and then
of course the camera which generally
produces better photos and videos than
the one plus six ok so that is it for me
in this video thank you guys for
watching and as always I'll see you in
the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
