and today i'll be doing a really simple
video on how to set a screen password
pattern or a log pattern on your android
phone so let's get right into it i'm
gonna go ahead and press home to get to
my home screen and up from here what you
want to do is press the menu and go over
to settings and from the settings menu
you're going to look for something along
the lines of security or privacy in this
case I only have security so I'll go
ahead and try that and here it is set up
lock screen that's what you're looking
for go ahead and press it and you can
see it gives you three options you do a
pattern which is you know what the name
says the pattern a pin so you can just
set a numeric pass passcode and then a
password which is a combination of
letters and numbers or just letters
using the keyboard this case I'll do
pattern because it's easy and most
people opt for this so I'll go ahead and
draw a pattern it's got to be at least
four dots but you can make it more
complex and obviously the one I have
done but just to keep it simple stick
with this and confirm so I ask you to
confirm it so you know you don't
accidentally put something in there and
forget it later and back out of it once
you've set your lock lock pattern I'm go
ahead and lock my phone and unlock it
and you can see the assassin for the for
the pattern if I enter it incorrectly
it's not going to let me into the phone
which is the whole reason you've done it
and uh that's pretty much it alright
this is David from phone booth comm
