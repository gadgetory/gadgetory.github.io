calm and in this video I'm doing a speed
comparison test between arguably the two
most popular Android tablets on the
market right now in the Asus Nexus 7 and
the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 so
obviously the assist Nexus 7 is in by
that lower price point at either $200
for the 8 gigabyte or $250 for the 16
gigabyte of course the Galaxy Note 10.1
is for the higher range and this one is
around $500 so what that says go ahead
and boot up the devices for our first
speed test so both of ours are obviously
off right now I'm gonna press and hold
power on both devices for a few seconds
let go and I will go ahead and see which
one actually boots up first
now both these guys are packing a lot of
power they both have quad-core
processors you looking at the NVIDIA
Tegra 3 processor at one point 3
gigahertz you look at the a keynotes for
quad at 1.4 gigahertz of course this guy
is 2 gigabytes of RAM compared to the
one game by Ram found on the Nexus 7 and
obviously when it comes to you know the
OS this one does have the newer version
being a nexus device is running 4.1
jellybean this guy's running 4.0 Ice
Cream Sandwich from the boot up times we
can see that the Samsung Galaxy Note
10.1 did actually unlock our finish
first and I unlocked it first and I will
go ahead and start up the application
speed test from here so it'll go ahead
and make this guy rotate up on me there
you go alright so first thing we'll do
is open up the game Temple Run now just
to let you guys know it is running on
the same Wi-Fi network on both devices
and for the browser test I cleared out
the browsing history so it's gonna be
nice and fair so I'm going to try to tap
these at the same time of a can so one
two three Sall the splash screen first
on the samsung galaxy note seems like it
loaded up first and whilst wait to see
the actual game menu there you go so you
see it did little faster on the Galaxy
Note 10.1 I'm gonna go ahead and hit
home on both devices I'm not gonna close
them out in the background because
they're both running Android so we're
gonna see you know the multitasking
capability of both devices I'm a really
quick turn out the brightness on the
Galaxy Note
all right so I went ahead and turned up
the brightness and let's go ahead and go
to the next application which is Flixter
so one two three go and again it looks
like a little faster on the galaxy note
mainly because you can see these
thumbnails over here all loaded up our
for the most part are loaded up on the
Nexus 7 they're still loading up and you
see some of them are starting to roll
through now there you go now we got the
thumbnail so obviously it did process
faster on the galaxy note tablet and
let's go ahead and go to the next
application which is Google Earth so one
two three it's all the splash screen
first again here it's all the earth here
first and you know presumably we're
gonna assume this will are this one's
faster so the rendering is a little bit
faster over here but this one actually
went closer is probably why I was blurry
nevermind so we'll go ahead and tap out
of there we'll go to Google Maps so one
two three and again Sall it a little bit
faster on the galaxy note 10.1 we'll go
ahead and whoops close out of here and
last application will run is score
Center before we get into the other
tests and I actually loaded up a little
bit faster on the Nexus 7 here we'll go
ahead and swipe over and wave let's see
which one we saw the content first on
again the score Center on the Nexus 7 is
faster
we got an ad we don't want to see that
go ahead and go to the NFL page and
pretty much it seems like the Nexus 7
you know I'll be a little bit but it is
faster than the Galaxy Note when it
comes to this certain application so
obviously you know your real world
experience is gonna be a little bit
different depending on you know what
applications you have but these are just
five general apps that I use and for the
most part you know you give the edge to
the Galaxy Note 10.1 but the next seven
wasn't that far behind them really
wasn't that big of a difference and it
did load up a little bit faster on score
Center biggest difference I think was in
the flick strap where the Galaxy Note
did load it up the little thumbnails a
lot faster than Nexus 7 so let's go
ahead and run a benchmark so I'm gonna
go ahead and close out the applications
over here so let's hit removal I can and
I'll go ahead and swipe them out of here
and we're gonna do a quick quadrant
benchmark so that way we kind of get
idea as far as the benchmark
so go ahead and open the quadrant
professional app on both and then we're
gonna hit run full benchmark and I'll
just skip through this whole process
that you guys don't have to actually
watch it and I'll let you guys see the
scores at the end
all right so both devices are now done
and you can see the galaxy or I'm sorry
the Nexus 7 scored a three thousand six
hundred and sixty seven obviously this
is just a benchmark but gives you good
ideas for us you know what as far as
what the benchmark tested with score is
and on the Galaxy Note 10.1 scored a
5850 so obviously pretty much like the
performance we've seen thus far the
Galaxy Note 10.1 is performing better
you know the frequency obviously is
faster at one point four gears versus
one point three and there is more RAM so
it's kind of expected both screens are
actually running at the same resolution
so that's not really playing a factor
let's go ahead and do the browser test
now so I'm gonna open up Google Chrome
Google Chrome isn't the default browser
over here it is on the Nexus 7 because
of jellybean on here is this a regular
Samson browser but I'm not gonna be
using that because you know I wanted to
be a little bit more fair I'm just gonna
load up a couple of websites I'm gonna
do the Google search for those websites
first so that way the pre-loading
doesn't affect you know we're trying to
type in first so first website will do
is phonebook com alright so it just did
a quick Google search for phone buff
obviously the first link is gonna be
phonebook com I'm gonna tap on these
guys at the same time so one two three
and I will try to see which one actually
loads first so try to pay attention I
might not be able to call it accurately
because it is kind of hard to look at
two devices at once saw the ads here
first so that gives me a better idea
this status bar actually showed to be
finished a little bit before this one
but if I'm looking are looking at the
content it looks like the galaxy note
did load it up a little bit faster well
go ahead and do a quick scroll test so
both scrolling really smoothly will tap
on this article right over here one two
three hopefully this one will give us a
better idea and we saw the content here
first and that was really close I mean
really couldn't tell obviously using
Google Chrome with a quad core you're
gonna get pretty much the same results
seems like alright so I'm gonna do a
Google search for NFL all right so you
see NFL comm shows up at the top on both
Google searches we're gonna go ahead and
tap on these at the same time so one two
three and try see which one actually
loads up
first saw the content here first on the
galaxy note and scores first here and
again the big slide show over here so
pretty much safe to say that the Galaxy
Note 10.1 does load up the NFL website
faster and that flash test will be a
little suit New York Times so I'm just
gonna do a Google for that all right so
I did a Google search for a New York
Times and we'll go ahead and tap on the
website right over here at the same time
if I can so one two three and saw the
content first on the galaxy note 10.1
more of the pictures and it's already
done this guy seems to be loading I mean
that's the status bar says but it looks
like it's pretty much done for the most
part so when still goes to the Galaxy
Note 10.1 for our last test we're just
gonna do a browser mark benchmark so
that way we can see you know the
benchmarks of the browsers and we'll be
done with it all right so I'll go ahead
and run the benchmark and I'll just skip
through the results so that way you guys
could see exactly what each device
scored
all right so the browser mark benchmark
is done and the Nexus 7 scored a one
hundred and twenty nine thousand seven
hundred and fifty four so a really high
score here obviously gonna get a great
browsing experience on the Nexus 7 and
we'll go ahead and look at the Galaxy
Note 10.1 and exceed scored a one
hundred fifty nine thousand nine hundred
and twenty two so really amazing scores
on both devices but obviously the faster
one or the higher score is on it the
Galaxy Note honestly that's what's been
reflected throughout this whole speed
test from the most part and you know I
mean you can't really fault in the Nexus
7 it only cost two hundred to two
hundred fifty dollars where this guy's
over five hundred dollars so not really
that big of a deal considering that this
guy is so close it might be worth it for
you guys if you know you want to spend
down much on a tablet really great
performance for you know per dollar
compared to this one however you're
gonna get more features this this is not
you know a device comparison by any
means this is speed comparison but
anyway those are the results I found
