and today i will be doing a quick review
on the sense keyboard the HTC Sense
keyboard so go ahead and open up the
keyboard this is search you can see
you've got the keys nicely spaced apart
and you've got the secondary keys let me
zoom in for you guys you guys could
actually see that right there so a lot
of people prefer this keyboard over the
gingerbread keyboard because of the fact
that you have more secondary options so
for example if I wanted to hit ? press
and hold k set into a question mark
that's pretty cool but what I really
like about this keyboard is it gives you
really three input methods within one
keyboard and that's basically the normal
way of typing so I know what I hit but
get the idea and then you could also do
the voice to text with a keyboard are
with the microphone key right there so
dog dog and you know you can see typed
in dog how to say it twice because I
spoke a little too early but anyway
works pretty good and then the third way
is almost a swipe type input method
which is pretty much is a swipe your
finger so i'll hit a type and dog and
there you go so you've got three methods
of typing I for me swipe works are the
swype type hub typing works better for
longer words for short words I use the
regular input method and whenever I feel
like at what everyone I'm in a quiet
environment I'll use the microphone
method but overall this keyboard is
really great really accurate and I
definitely recommend looking into it if
you're looking for an HTC phone I mean
that might be a deal maker or breaker
for some people and for me that's one of
my favorite parts while HTC Sense is the
keyboard don't really care for all the
other stuff but
the keyboard definitely makes a
difference that's all for me this is
