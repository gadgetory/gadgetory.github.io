conducted by trained professionals along
with some random brown guy and Ross
Geller look-alike do not try this at
home what's up guys david and jay here
and welcome to the very first episode of
vs the show where we work with
professionals to conduct extreme
durability tests today we're hanging out
at Cal State Long Beach with the oldest
archery club in the country stay along a
beach say archery club and we're gonna
be shooting these guys at these iPhones
so do it or start it into it
that's good that's company I think we
got it right ok
all right so we got an iPhone 6s we're
gonna go ahead and mount it onto the
target and we have our Archer van well
over a hundred feet away from us where
he's gonna shoot an arrow straight into
this thing so what do thinks gonna
happen I'm going straight into it if it
hit it it's a hundred over a hundred
feet away we thought I'm practicing
they're doing a great job but it's
really windy now so I'm kind of curious
to see what's gonna happen I said oh can
you do like 50 feet knees like so I'm
confidence in the man because he has
confidence in what if he if he doesn't
it what do things gonna happen he didn't
go straight through and shadow
everything or it's got bounced off or
there's gonna be I know straight through
and I guess there's only one way to find
out though all right go see the freaking
do the test all you sir those bows and
arrows are freaking gnarly by the way he
flips it as he puts it into the bowl
Monsey be all backwards all right all
right
I feel like we're like watching golf you
know how everyone's always like super
quiet and I break the concentration in
here oh my gosh why I almost like I drew
I think it's rule I got a freaking drool
car man let's go come on you hit it oh
look I got pushed into the freaking
target look at the glass the shattering
everywhere oh my god that is beautiful
oh some reason have Enya playing in my
head while watching that's cool
oh my gosh and if fall towards cab
that's perfect if all this is turning
towards camera like yeah I'm a picture
perfect turn the glass are still flying
everywhere - that is freaking beautiful
can we see that one more times well see
the impact when it gets pushed into the
target avoidance is really cool for me
it happens so freakin quickly yeah even
see that the arrow kind of bow it so I
mean pun intended but you see it bowing
a little bit we couldn't ask for a
better shot my turn towards camera well
it's safe to say we can't make a phone
call anymore
straight through look at that look at
the back thanks to Vans handiwork he
gave this phone a new face facelift yeah
a little skewer oh my gosh so the glass
obviously shattered went up at an angle
- but my favorite part is the back I
mean look at the metal right yeah that's
all it's all twisted through and look
you can see some of the the chips on the
inside coming out that is not pretty
watch out for him he's doing big things
don't make him mad alright so that is
what happens when you shoot an arrow at
an iphone from over a hundred feet that
was pretty awesome
