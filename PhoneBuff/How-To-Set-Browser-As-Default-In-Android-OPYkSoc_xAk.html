comm and today we're doing a how-to
video on how to make a browser your
default browser right now on my phone
the stock Android browser is set as
default which is this guy I downloaded
the Dolphin Browser or you know you
could do this with any browser like
Opera Mini or some of the other ones so
you just what you want to do is find the
browser you want to set as default so in
this case Dolphin wait for it to load up
hit menu go to the settings depending on
the app is going to be a little bit
different but it's pretty similar in
this case I'm going to go to Dolphin
settings and click on set as default
browser so I'll go ahead and do that and
you can see this little pop-up box it's
going to be asking complete action using
either dolphin or Internet which is the
stock browser I'm gonna click on dolphin
before I do that since I want to make it
my default browser I'm gonna click on
this little checkbox saying use by
default for this action so I'm hit
dolphin and now the Dolphin Browser is
my default browser um
now say you did this and decided hey you
know what dolphin isn't right for me I
want to have it on my phone but I don't
want it to be the default so you want to
make the stock browser your default you
could do it in two ways one you go back
into dolphin and uncheck that box which
hopefully will make it go back to the
internet browser but if you have a few
browsers on your phone like opera and
dolphin and the stock one it becomes a
little bit trickier so what you want to
do or the simplest way to do it is hit
menu settings and go to applications
manage applications and then hit dolphin
because that's the one we set as default
I'm gonna hit clear default
and now you can see when you go to the
browser the stock one becomes a default
again and if we go into the settings of
the dolphin browser you'll see that the
boxes are automatically unchecked so
it's just a different way of doing it
reason when I go over that is because
every device is different and sometimes
people aren't able to set their stock
browsers default because once they set
another one anyway that's pretty much it
