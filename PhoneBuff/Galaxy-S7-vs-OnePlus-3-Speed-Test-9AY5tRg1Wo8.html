speedtest a lot of you been asking for
is here one pose finally released their
official RAM management update which
supposedly better utilizes these six
gigabytes of RAM the one plus three is
packing so today it will face off
against the current Android speed test
champ in the X and O's variant of the
galaxy s7 skit right into it alright so
right off the bat the oneplus three
takes the lead with it snapping that
selfie and viewing it in the gallery in
no time with it moving past the Settings
app and already working on subway
surfers but time and again the galaxy s7
has proven that it's no-trump with it
right behind the oneplus 3 joining it in
loading up subway surfers and actually
passing it so an early come back by the
s7 as it looks to improve on its lead
blowing through true skate and already
working on smash it so halfway through
this first lap both bones are
neck-and-neck with very little
separation between the two the one plus
three is just a split second behind the
galaxy s7 as both phones work on clash
of clans where the oneplus theory
captures the lead and moves on to
Photoshop mix both bounce lota Photoshop
makes that about the same rate so the
oneplus 3 maintains his lead as it moves
on to lap Civ where each phone will have
to create a time-lapse from the same
exact video file and thanks to its lead
you want plus started about 10 frames
ahead of the s7 edge in this time-lapse
out of the 120 frames there are the
process and as you can see the 1+3 and
its snapdragon 820 is going at a much
faster rate than the Exynos packing
galaxy s7 with it now about 20 frames
ahead and only adding more as time goes
on finishing roughly 30 frames ahead of
the s7 as it moves on to hulu so things
aren't looking so hot for the reigning
android speed test champ in the galaxy
s7 but remember there's still the second
lap where the multitasking abilities of
each phone will be put to the test and
we'll see if one plus actually fix the
RAM management issues the phone had one
of those first released so here we go
the one plus three is about to finish
the first stop with a time of one minute
thirty one seconds and moves on to the
second lap where so far so good but the
true test is the gaming row and yes the
one plus 3 has subway surfers open as it
does true skate and smash it so the one
plus three is just ripping through the
second lap as the S
an edge finishes the first lap with a
time of 1 minute and 41 seconds so the 1
plus 3 with its 6 gigabytes of RAM is
handling all the apps in the background
like a boss sprinting towards the finish
line with a time of 1 minute and 57
seconds with us fast-forwarding the SM
and edge to the end where it finishes 20
seconds later with the time of 2 minutes
and 17 seconds so there you have it the
new Android speed says champ is the one
plus 3 thank you guys for watching in as
always I'll see you in the very next
