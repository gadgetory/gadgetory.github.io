calm and I'm doing a video on how to
store your apps to your SD card on
Android to things you need to know up
front is one you do need to have version
2.2 of Android or higher and second is
you're not going to be able to do this
with all apps just the absolute the
developers intended for you to be able
to store the absolute SD card so with
that said I'll go ahead and show you how
to do it so we're going to go to your
home screen press this Menu key and go
to settings and then from settings
you're going to go to applications once
you get applications just hit manage
applications and you should be taken to
a list of all the apps you have on your
phone so you can see the size or how
much space each app is taking on my
phone
Angry Birds is taking 2.9 this one I
showed you moved over to my SD that's
why it's taking so little normally takes
about 20 but uh drag-racing taken seven
so if you have a lot of or if you have
limited space on your phone you want to
get rid of these apps are taking up a
bunch of space so I want to click on
drag racing and I'm going to hit move to
SD so you see it's taking up seven point
four six megabytes total right now and
after that's done you see now it's only
taking 816 kilobytes so basically saving
six megabytes of space on your internal
storage but that's pretty much it I mean
it's really simple to do and just go
into your app list and try to free up as
much internal memory as you can if
memory is an issue for you this is David

watching the video and don't forget to
