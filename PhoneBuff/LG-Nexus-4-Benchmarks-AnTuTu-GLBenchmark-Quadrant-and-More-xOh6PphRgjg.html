foam ball calm and in this video we're
doing a benchmarking of the LG Nexus 4
with did Snapdragon s4 pro processor and
2 gigabytes of RAM so we'll go ahead and
start with the first benchmark where
it's going to be quadrant professional
so basically I'm gonna do for all the
benchmarks is I'm just going to run it
and I'm going to skip through the
processor you guys get it straight to
the results
alright so the quadrant benchmark is
done you can see it's scored a 4639 so
4639 go ahead and go to the next
benchmark which is going to be an 22 so
go ahead and tap on this guy and proceed
to run the benchmark
alright so the intent to benchmark is
done and scored a 90 643 so go ahead and
go to the next bed prank now which is
going to be a Balaam oh so go ahead and
open this guy up and we'll just run the
all the chapters
alright so the Vilano benchmark is done
in the html5 is scored 1276 and then the
metal benchmark is scored 572 I so now
we'll run GL benchmark go ahead and hit
performance tests and then start
alright so the GL benchmark is
we'll go ahead and take a look at these
scores this benchmark actually took over
15 minutes so a really long one let's
kind of go ahead and scroll through here
so you guys get good idea as far as all
these little scores here but I want to
work my way down to the bottom so you
guys can see the frames per second so go
ahead and freeze it over here for a few
seconds and now we'll go ahead and
scroll down a little bit more and show
you the final scores here so it's 20 30
frames per second here 1654 and then 46
all right so we'll go ahead and go to
the final benchmark which is CF bench
alright so the CF benchmark is done
we'll go ahead and scroll down to the
results and you see the results right
over here so go ahead and bring this up
closer to the camera your device which
is the LG Nexus 4 is right here scoring
a 16,000 641 4919 and 9607 you see the
HTC One X and the galaxy s3 actually
score above it in this case so that
pretty much concludes the benchmarking
of the nexus 4 course you know these are
just benchmarks I'd recommend checking
out some of our speed tests we've done
on the channel which you know basically
tests the real world performance for the
speed of opening apps putting up browser
tests etc but anyway that's pretty much
it for me in this video if you found it
