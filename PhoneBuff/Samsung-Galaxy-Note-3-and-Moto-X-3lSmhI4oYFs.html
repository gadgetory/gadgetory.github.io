facebook.com/foxnewslatino scotto asks
are you excited about the note 3 well
today I'm excited is probably an
understatement out of any of the
upcoming smartphones I think the note 3
is the one I'm most looking forward to
there are a couple of reasons for this
but one of them is the fact that I was
just so impressed with what Samsung did
with the note 2 last year I mean the
note 2 had just about everything I
really wanted in a smartphone at the
time a big HD screen that wasn't pencil
check a quad core processor with 2
gigabytes of RAM check a bigger
removable battery and a microSD card
slot check and check and on top of all
of it it had an S Pen alongside actually
useful of TouchWiz features running on
the latest version of Android when it
launched with the Galaxy Note 2 Samson
made it pretty clear that the note was
going to be their high-end smartphone
line and with the rumors we've heard so
far about the note 3 it looks like this
is still going to be the case as of
right now the rumors points in a note 3
having a bigger 5.7 26 inch full HD
screen a more powerful quad-core
processor either the Snapdragon 800 or
an upgraded version of the Exynos 5 trip
a whopping three gigabytes of RAM a 13
megapixel camera a 3300 plus milliamp
battery and either the same plastic body
on the galaxy s4 or maybe just maybe a
new aluminum one with samsung's new
design three-point no philosophy as far
as what I expect I think the note 3 will
look a lot like the galaxy s4 meaning
it'll probably have a bigger 5.7 inch
screen but we'll say about the same size
as a note too thanks to smaller bezels
and while I hope I'm wrong I don't
really see Samsung switching to
something other than plastic just yet
I say this because if they don't use
plastic and one with aluminum or
something different people might not as
easily identify the note 3 as a galaxy
smartphone which considering all the
money they've spent already marketing
the galaxy s4 it might not be the best
move for them when it comes to the
processor I've been leaning towards a
two point three gigahertz Snapdragon 800
for a while now but Samsung just
recently announced the upgraded Exynos 5
trip which makes me think that it just
might be hbu on the note 3 so I'm kind
of 50 50 year 3 gigabytes of RAM seems
to be consistently rumored and
considering that the note 2 had more ram
than the International is 3 3 gigabytes
doesn't seem like too much of a stretch
the camera on the s4 is great so I
expect the same one the note 3 maybe
with a few enhancements like optical
image stabilization and lastly I expect
a note 3 to be running on a TouchWiz
modified version of jelly bean 4.3 when
it launches of course these are all
rumors and speculation and we'll know
for sure what the note 3 will be on
September fourth when samsung unveils it
at IFA Twitter follower Alondra ass what
phone do you use on an everyday basis
for yourself that answer changes often
since I'm always testing out new phones
but right now I'm back to using the HTC
One I was using the Play edition galaxy
s4 before this but since it didn't
support Bluetooth telling which I need
for google glass I came back to the one
and I've got to tell you every time I
watch a YouTube video on this thing with
those boomsound speakers I'm really glad
that I did facebook fan kanishk ready
asks is it one gigahertz single core
processor good for ICS the word good can
mean different things to different
people but personally I don't think a
single core 1 gigahertz processor can
give you that good user experience that
Android has to offer replace the word
good with decent and yeah I think the
one gig or processor is enough to get
the job done but again it really depends
on the software if its stock Android
then it'll probably be fine but if it
has some heavy manufacturer you I over
top of it then I'd expect some serious
lag somewhere down the line is DVF
humble coms weekly poll do you think the
Moto X is worth the 200 our price tag
and I got mixed results the majority of
you at forty-six percent think that the
Moto X isn't worth the two hundred
dollars on contract however twenty-nine
percent of you think that it is fourteen
percent of you aren't sure yet meaning
you're either waiting for some foam
bluff coverage or to use the device
yourselves and eleven percent of you say
you'll wait for the price to drop which
is basically another way of saying that
it's not worth the 200 price point but
you still think it's a good phone as far
as the results go I think I've fallen to
the not sure yet category I haven't been
able to get my hands on the Moto X just
yet but from what I've read and seen the
phone looks to be pretty solid I do have
some concerns about the screen and the
performance but i do like what motor
rule is doing with the Moto X instead of
engaging in the spec war which was more
important a few years ago than it is
today they're trying to innovate with
new features like always on voice
controls and the ability to customize
the Moto X with over 360 color
combinations whether or not that makes
the phone where two hundred dollars
still remains to be seen alright guys
