are two of the best phones out there
right now so in this two-part video
series we're going to take a look at a
bunch of reasons why each phone can be
considered better than the other number
one the screen the galaxy s7 has a
higher resolution at 2560 by 1440 versus
the iPhone 6s at 1134 by 7:50 it also
has a brighter and bigger screen at 5.1
inches versus 4.7 number two always on
display this feature shows the time and
date when the screen is off for quick
information at a glance three a 12
megapixel rear camera the F 1.7 aperture
produces cleaner photos and videos in
low-light the s7 also has optical image
stabilization which gives a less shaky
video for the 5 megapixel front camera
the wider lens allows you to take those
group selfies without having to pull out
that selfie stick 5 quick camera launch
from any screen on or off you can
quickly launch a camera with a DoubleTap
of the home button so you never miss a
photo 6 heart rate monitor having this
allows for quick and easy tracking with
Samsung's s health app 7 IP 68 water and
dust resistance the galaxy s7 won't get
damaged from accidental spills this also
allows for easier cleaning so you don't
have to worry about answering a call
with dirty hands for those audio files
you can even take it with you in the
shower 8 expandable storage allows for
up to 200 gigabytes extra storage via
its microSD slot 9 storage the s7 has 32
gigabytes of internal storage versus the
6s which has 16 at the same price point
10 multi window multitasking you can use
two apps on the screen at the same time
you can browse the web while scrolling
through Facebook or watch YouTube while
using Google Maps 11 private mode this
allows you to hide photos on your phone
for example you can hide certain photos
from showing up in the photo gallery
only accessible by fingerprint or
password 12 SOS messages triple pressing
the power button can send a quick alert
to emergency contacts this can alert
them with your GPS location a photo from
the front and rear cameras along with a
short audio recording for context of the
emergency 13 themes customize the look
of the interface with themes so you can
keep your phone looking fresh 14 LED
notification
a physical LED light will flash a
certain color depending on the app move
for text yellow for snapchat etc letting
you know you have a missed notification
when the screen is off with a glance you
can decide whether or not to turn on the
screen 15 fast charging the galaxy s7
can be charged quicker getting up to 50%
in as little as 30 minutes 16
longer-lasting battery with the
always-on display feature disabled the
battery lasts longer overall this varies
with usage but generally the s7
outperforms it also has ultra power
saving mode going beyond the typical
saver mode and essentially turns the
smartphone into a dumb phone turning
what would be hours of battery life into
days 17 wireless charging built-in
wireless charging so you can charge the
phone on any charging pad which is great
for public places 18 default
applications you can set new default
applications allowing you to permanently
replace a system app with one of your
choosing for example you can have the
phone dialer app replaced by Skype so
even if you see a phone number in a
webpage clicking on it will open Skype
instead of the stock phone app after
it's set to default 19 file manager this
allows you to manage files on your phone
easily like on a computer you can see
all the folders on your phone and the
files within that you can also drag and
drop content from your phone onto your
computer like you would with a flash
drive no need to use iTunes or similar
software 20 clipboard beyond just copy
and paste you can copy up to 20 pieces
of text or photos to the clipboard and
paste them in any order later on and
this isn't limited to copy and pasting
one item at a time copy and paste up to
20 at once 21 o TG adapter with the
included adapter you can easily connect
USB peripherals to the phone like a
keyboard mouse or flash drive 22 to our
app return policy the s7s App Store
Google Play has a two-hour return period
where you can return an app right from
the phone itself so you can try apps and
if you don't like them you won't be
stuck with the purchase 23 Samsung pay
this works almost anywhere compared to
Apple pay which only works at terminals
with NFC technology Apple pay works at
over 700,000 retail locations Samsung
pay works at over 30 million truly the
next step to replacing the physical
wallet 24 sharing not only can you share
content straight from one app to another
like your photo gallery to Instagram but
the s7 also learns your share in habits
and puts your frequent contacts in a
prominent location 25 scheduled text
messages with the s7 you can schedule
text messages in the future on specific
days and times this comes in handy for
sending birthday messages at midnight
saying happy anniversary or anything
else you may not want to forget so those
are the top 25 reasons the Samsung
Galaxy s7 can be considered better than
the iPhone 6s now the word better is
subjective so be sure to watch the
iPhone 6s version which is annotated
