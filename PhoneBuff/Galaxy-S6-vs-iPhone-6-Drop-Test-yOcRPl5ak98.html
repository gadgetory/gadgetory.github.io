straight up suck I mean typically the
reviewer will drop the phone for more
random height onto whatever random
surface they happen to be standing on
and despite their best efforts they
dropped the phone at a random angle due
to human error this leads to
inconsistent results across the board
that never truly tell you just how
durable a phone really is and how that
phone stacks up to the competition well
we're here to finally change all that
with the foam of style drop test where
with the help of a professional drop
chest machine not only do we drop each
and every phone in the same exact height
down to the centimeter at least seeing
angles but we also drop them onto these
same two services starting off with tile
to reflect your indoor drops and then
moving on to concrete to reflect your
outdoor drops together giving you the
most accurate and comprehensive drop
test on YouTube in this video when we
drop testing the all-new Galaxy s6
against the iPhone 6 to see which flash
of smartphone is the most durable let's
go ahead and get right into it all right
so we'll start things off by dropping
each phone from one meter onto tile
first up is the galaxy s6 with the
backdrop in three two one so despite
having Gorilla Glass for the glass on
the back on the s6 still managed to get
cracked with the backdrop though it is
worth noting that most of the damage
that you see here isn't going to cut
your finger if you run it across it like
shattered glass would but it's still a
disappointing result moving on we're
doing the same exact backdrop on two
tile but with the iPhone 6 this time in
three two one
and unlike the Galaxy s6 the iPhone 6
doesn't have a glass bag so as you'd
expect there isn't too much damage just
a few small scratches here and there but
other than that it actually looks pretty
good next draw for the galaxy s6 is the
side drop in three two one and as you
can see the screen is still working and
fully functional you have some light
scratches at the very bottom right of
the phone where it made impact but
nothing too serious and on the back it
does look like the side drop has added
to the damage with the cracks spider
webbing a bit so we'll have to keep an
eye on that as we move through the tests
next up is the iPhone 6 I drop in three
two one
after the side drop test the iPhone
screen still works with the only real
damage to the bottom of the phone with
some scuffs and scratches along with a
minor dent by the headphone jack alright
now for the more interesting drops where
the galaxy s6 is dropped onto its face
in three two one so while the screen
itself on the galaxy s6 still
technically works the glass over top of
it is cracked enough so we're using it
could cause you to cut your finger and
actually if we take a closer look at the
bottom right where the majority of that
damages you can see that the display
underneath it has actually been blacked
out at the very bottom right so pretty
significant damage from that last test
now it's the iPhones turn to get dropped
on his face and three two one
all right so the iPhone didn't fare so
well in that last drop while the display
still works the front glass is almost
completely shattered much worse than the
galaxy s6 is did but the screen
underneath it still actually works and
looks fine whereas the s6 has had some
damage so that's something actually
worth noting now that we're done
dropping the phones onto tile we're
going to take it to the next level and
drop them onto concrete starting off
with the galaxy s6 on its back in three
two one
alright so the back of the galaxy s6 is
now shattered but as unusual as it may
be that's not a big story here the real
surprise is that the s6 stopped working
immediately after impact from the
backdrop and no matter what we did we
just could not get it to come back to
life okay let's see if the iPhone 6 fair
is better with the concrete backdrop in
three two one
so uh I think that looked in sounded
worse than actually was the sim holder
popped out of the iPhone but it pops
right back in no problem there are
however some additional scuffs and
scratches on the back of the phone much
more than there were after the tile test
but overall it's actually nothing too
bad and nothing that you wouldn't really
expect so while the galaxy s6 already
gave out the show must go on with the
side drop in three two one
all right so we got more damage to the
front of the phone with more cracks in
spider webbing but on the bottom side of
the phone it actually held up quite
nicely with very little additional
damage time for the same side drop on
the iPhone in three two one
alright so Wow
despite chunks of glass literally flying
out the display on the iPhone 6 still
works but at this point there's barely
any screen real estate that isn't
shattered with the bulk of the damage
coming at the bottom right which
previously actually wasn't too damaged
so that concrete side test really put a
beating on the iPhone
okay so last drop for the galaxy s6
before we put it out of its misery with
a face drop in three two one
so obviously the screen isn't working
and it hasn't been since a few drops ago
but after that last face drop I have to
say that the galaxy s6 is Gorilla Glass
4 holds up pretty well relative to the
iPhone 6s glass with just a little
additional damage in spider webbing
alright time for the last drop in this
video with the iPhone face drop in three
two one and the iPhone 6 still works the
glass is completely shot shattered even
more than in the last drop but the phone
still works and you can still make a
call if you absolutely needed to pretty
crazy so in the end with its rear glass
cracking early on and the fact that it
stopped responding halfway through the
test the galaxy s6 gets a fumble
durability score of 3.7 the iPhone 6 on
the other hand with chunks of glass
literally flying out from the front of
the device but the phone's still
technically usable it's a higher form of
durability score of 5.3 so there you
have it that is it for me in this video
