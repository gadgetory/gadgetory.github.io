bug and in this video we'll be comparing
myself / or smartphone in the Nokia
Lumia 920 against Apple's in the iPhone
5 to see which smartphone comes out on
top between the two now these are two
very different smartphones as you guys
can see and they take different
approaches to what a smartphone should
be but they each have their own set of
pros and cons so we're gonna go ahead
and compare them in this video see which
one at least is better for you between
the two we'll start off this comparison
like we usually do by comparing the
build quality and design of each bone
the Lumia 920 is made up of a solid
feeling polycarbonate material that's
coloured all the way through which means
any scuffs and scratches you may
encounter will be less noticeable than
it would be on the iPhone 5 the 920
weighs in at a hefty 185 grams making it
almost 65% heavier than the iPhone 5 and
it doesn't do a great job by hiding that
way either with a ten point seven
millimeter thickness this may seem like
a deal-breaker
and for many it just might be but
personally I think its weight and
thickness play quite well into the
premium and durable feel that Nokia has
been known for over time the iPhone 5
has a premium look and feel to it as
well with an all glass and anodized
aluminum body but it's a different type
of premium compared to the Lumia 920 if
the 920's body were to be a luxury sedan
then the iPhone 5s would be more like a
sports car with a slight weight of 112
grams and it's 28% thinner profile which
measures in at just seven point six
millimeters thick and not only is the
iPhone thinner and lighter but it also
is not as wide as the Lumia which makes
it a little bit easier to hold and use
in one hand the two phones are really
really close when it comes to build
quality and design but if I had to give
an inch to any one phone here it would
be the Lumia 920 I only say this because
despite its unfavorable size and weight
the 920 is available in more colors than
the iPhone 5 is and has organ Armour
curves on the back and edges that kind
of make up for its bulging size and the
durability of the phone is just
downright impressive just watch some of
the durability tests on the channel if
you don't know what I'm talking about
alright with a design and build quality
out of the way let's take a look at the
displays on each smartphone the Lumia
920 has a 4.5 inch
pure motion plus IPS display with a
resolution of 1280 by 768 giving you a
ppi of 330
one the iPhone five on the other hand
has a 4-inch Retina display with the
resolution of 11 36 by 640 garnering a
PPI of 326 when it comes to brightness
and viewing angles both screens are
among the best available but from our
experience the iPhone 5 looks brighter
when indoors and seems to have slightly
better viewing angles as a result
however the clear black technology in
the 920 that causes this makes up for
the dimmer screen with better outdoor
visibility when you consider the bigger
screen size higher HD resolution and
pixel density along with this more
sensitive touchscreen that could be used
with gloves or a pen you have to give
the win to the Lumia 920 in the display
category when it comes to performance
both phones for a dual-core processor
with a gig of ram the Lumia 920 has the
Snapdragon s4 under the hood while the
iPhone 5 has Apple's custom a6 chip so
how do they perform you ask well from
our tests the iPhone 5 booted up loaded
apps and browse the web faster than the
Lumia 920 did giving it the clear
advantage in the performance category
you would think that with the superior
performance in slimmer design the
smaller 1440 milliamp battery on the
iPhone 5 wouldn't last as long as the
2000 milliamp battery on the Lumia 920
but you'd be wrong thanks to its smaller
screen size and perhaps a few software
optimizations the iPhone 5 actually
lasted us longer than the Lumia 920 data
our tests giving it the edge in the
battery department the saying goes that
the best camera is the one that you have
on you and luckily both of these
smartphones have great cameras the Lumia
920 sports an eight point seven
megapixel camera with carl zeiss lens
and LED flash
it also has optical image stabilization
where little Springs absorb the movement
of a shaking hand to help produce
clearer images and stable video the
iPhone 5 on the other hand has an 8
megapixel camera with LED flash and its
built-in app gives you the option for
panorama and HDR modes where you'd have
to download a separate app on the Lumia
to get the 920's built-in app does how I
relate to change things like ISO and
exposure
giving you more control over how your
photos look overall we found that the
Nokia's camera produce slightly better
pictures and much better video than the
iPhone 5s giving the wind to the Lumia
in this category because both phones
lack the option for expandable storage
the battle on the storage front comes
down to which manufacturer offers the
highest memory model which in this case
is Apple with an available 64 gigabyte I
phone 5 compared to the 32 gigabytes
found on the highest mall
of the Lumia 920 of course this doesn't
really matter if you don't plan on
getting a phone with 64 gigabytes but
it's still something worth mentioning
with both phones having a three
microphone setup and support for HD
Voice the call quality is great on
either device the speakers aren't too
bad either
here's a sample of both
in our opinion the Lumia 920 stereo
speakers have louder and fuller output
than the iPhone 5s giving it the win in
this category agree or disagree let us
know in the comments down below when it
comes to the software side of things it
really depends on what you prefer
between Windows Phone 8 and iOS 6.1 both
operating systems offer unique features
and benefits that go beyond the scope of
this video but the thing we think is
worth mentioning here is the huge
advantage the iPhone 5 has when it comes
to available apps while a lot of the
major apps out there have come or are
coming to Windows Phone the fact remains
that some of the apps you may use on
your current phone be it an older iPhone
or an Android device won't be available
on the Lumia 920 and because of this the
iPhone 5 has the clear advantage in this
department some of the notable features
on the Lumia 920 are that unlike the
iPhone 5 has a dedicated camera button
with a two-stage shutter
it has qi wireless charging capability
so you can finally dish the wire and it
supports near-field communications or
NFC notable features on the iPhone 5 are
that it has a dedicated vibrate switch
it has HDMI output via its lightning
port and that it comes with Apple's ear
pod headphones inside the box before
deciding on which phone is best for you
the final thing you should consider is
the price I'll drop some Amazon links
down in the description box below
but the gist of it is that the Lumia 920
is currently available for as low as $50
with a two-year agreement and cost $450
at full retail for the 32 gigabyte
version the iPhone 5 on the other hand
is available for $200 with the two-year
agreement and costs $650 at full retail
for the same 16 gigabyte version the 100
to 200 dollar difference isn't pocket
change for most people so pricing is
definitely an advantage the Lumia 920
has over the iPhone 5 all right there
you have it that's our take on the Nokia
Lumia 920 versus the Apple iPhone 5 like
I said in the beginning of the video
both phones have a lot to offer and each
has their own set of pros and cons when
it comes to choosing which one is best
for you
it's not just about counting the pros
and cons of each device but determining
how important each one of those pros and
cons are to you anyways that's pretty
much it for me in this video if you
