drought test a lot of you have been
asking for is finally here today we have
a heavyweight matchup with the galaxy s7
active and the new Moto G force which
supposedly has an unshadowed will
display does it really I don't know
that's why we do these drop tests so
let's go ahead and get right into it
round number one backdrop three two one
so I had to sleep thought that the Moto
z-force was going to do worse than the
active on that backdrop but as you can
see while neither phone sustained too
much damage the Moto Z did better here
giving it the nod in round number one
round number two bottom drop three two
one both phones handled that bottom drop
with ease with a galaxy s7 active
sustaining a bit less damage than the
Moto Z giving it the slight edge in
round number two round number three side
drop and three two one Oh
the side job gives both pounds a few
scuffs along the bottom on the top with
the Moto Z's scuffs being slightly more
visible giving the nod to the s7 active
in the third round round number four
face drop three two one alright so both
phones survived the base drop which
honestly I'm more impressed by the Moto
Z here considering that it doesn't look
like a phone with a case on it like the
s Evan active does but in terms of
damage the two heavyweights did about
the same so it's a draw for round number
four bonus round
okay so last time when the galaxy s7
entered the bonus round it survived
fifty additional drops to the face now
while it survived to all 50 drops it
didn't do so unscathed and suffered
several scuffs and scratches along the
way so today we'll see whether or not
the Moto G Force can match those 50
drops and whether or not it can do so
while sustaining less damage in the
process let's find out three two one
that looks promising I saw a little bit
of screen blow from the drop
still works you can stuff Mars but still
work six we do 100 turned off Wow six
that's sick after six bonus shops the
Moto Z force finally gave out now it is
worth noting that the display itself
didn't crack here so the unshadowed will
display claim still technically holds up
but instead it seems us something on the
inside went bad as you can still hear
the phone boot up but you just can't see
anything on the screen so there you have
it the galaxy s7 active remains at the
top of the chart and defends his title
as the most durable smartphone in the
world that is it for me in this video
thank you guys for watching and as
always I'll see you in the very next
episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
