fan in this video i'm gonna try to help
answer a question that lobby has been
asking that's how much of a difference
or how much better is having 1080p
resolution on a smart phone like on the
new galaxy s4 for example compared to a
720p resolution like on this predecessor
here and the galaxy s3 in other words is
having a full HD screen really all that
it's made out to be or is it just
another gimmick that manufacturers use
to produce some kind of marketing hype
well let's go ahead and find out so on a
phone like the galaxy s4 with its full
HD 1920 by 1080 resolution packed into a
display size of less than 5 inches you
get a PPI which stands for pixels per
inch or dots per inch of 441 in contrast
the 1280 by 720 resolution on the galaxy
s3 is 4 point 8 inch screen gives you a
ppi of just 306 now when it comes to PPI
or pixel density the main thing to
remember is that the higher the PPI is
the more detailed it will technically be
on the screen at least inch per inch the
next thing to remember is that PPI is
based on two main factors one of course
is the resolution or the total number of
pixels and the second is the size of the
screen that's actually housing those
pixels so the bigger the screen is the
less pixel density will be if resolution
stays the same and the opposite is true
with a smaller screen having a higher
pixel density with the same resolution
now considering through these two phones
in particular have similar screen sizes
but have a big difference in total
number of pixels you don't really have
to be a mathematician to know that
having 1080p resolution is gonna give
you a significantly higher pixel density
and therefore better inch per inch
quality than 720p just take one look
under the microscope and you can clearly
see the more than 130 PPI difference
between these two screens this is what
regular text looks like on the 720p
galaxy s3 here's what that same text
looks like on the 1080p Galaxy s4 but
there's this text right so here's a
picture on the 1080p galaxy s4 okay you
ready here's what that same picture
looks like on the 720p galaxy s3 yeah
pretty big difference right I mean when
you look at them side-by-side there's
really no comparison text and photos
just look so much sharper and so much
more detailed on a 1080p display so is
this proof enough that 1080p
is indeed significantly better and it's
not all just a little marketing to sales
new phones well yes and no you see the
truth is it's not that simple and that's
because for one we don't look at our
phones through microscope we use our
eyes and - there's a point in pixel
density are going to be somewhere
between 250 and 350 PPI that most
experts like display mates dr. Raymond
sanera say additional pixels don't
necessarily translate into better
quality with ordinary viewing as in
anything above this range
those eyes views look at our screens
aren't really able to appreciate in fact
this is why Apple calls the display on
the iPhone a Retina display since this
pixel density still falls within this
Retina range despite having a lower
resolution than even 720p thanks to its
smaller display size now look I'd heard
this argument before even touch the tiny
people on a person and it made perfect
sense to me I mean it's the same thing
as when you stand up close to a 1080p TV
with the face up close to the screen
you'll most likely be able to see the
pixels given that pixel densities on
most HD TVs are around 50 PPI give or
take depending on the size now what that
may seem really low to you when you go
sit back on the couch those individual
pixels just sort of blend away into the
picture to the point where they're not
even noticeable what these experts are
saying is that the 250 to 350 PPI range
is more than enough for us not to be
able to see the difference when it comes
to our phones well it's a logical
argument you know me I started to see it
for myself so after hours of analyzing
these two screens side by side looking
at a whole rate of pictures and text
with just my eyes this time so no
microscope as I say that I actually do
see a difference but it's something that
I only noticed when I'm actually looking
for the difference with the phone close
up to my face like this with the phone
further out like this with ordinary
viewing I honestly can't see the
difference and that's what the perfect
vision now with the whole 1080p or 720p
argument this is how I sum it up you
don't necessarily see the difference
with your eyes on a day-to-day basis
with ordinary viewing but there
definitely is a difference as clearly
evidence when you look at it under the
microscope which sort of makes you feel
the difference when using the two phones
but as a disclaimer I have to tell you
that I think the majority of that
feeling of better quality at least when
it comes to these two phones is due to
the better screen technology using the
galaxy s4 compared to that on the galaxy
s3 just like when you're comparing super
LCD to - super
three screens I guess what I'm trying to
say is that just like with cameras it's
not all about the resolution resolution
definitely plays a big part a huge part
as more resolution does mean more detail
but at the same time things like
contrast brightness and even energy
efficiency also play a role in what
makes one display better than the other
so when it comes to these two phones the
galaxy s4 screen is better I mean hands
down there's really no question about it
but when I say that it's mainly because
the s4 display is brighter and its
colors a little bit more accurate it was
the other way around where the s3 had
the 1080p resolution and the s4 had 720p
but everything else on the two screens
stay the same I think I'd still go for
the s4 screen because again the
difference in resolution isn't all that
noticeable on a day to day basis but
brightness the contrast and all those
other things definitely are with that
said though I'd still like to see 1080p
resolution on high-end smartphones from
here on now at least performs with
screens over four and a half inches sure
there isn't a significant perceptual
difference between the two and the extra
pixels can actually consume a little bit
more battery life but being the phone
book that I am and I'm sure you guys can
agree with me on this one I just like
knowing that my screen is completely
maxed out as in no matter how hard I
look near or far I can't see the
individual pixels on my screen now
wondering my phone screen maxed out
doesn't mean I don't want anything
higher than 1080p on a smart phone I
mean if a five-inch phone had a 4k
display or something crazy like that it
would have a PPI of over 850 which
wouldn't be a complete waste and I don't
even want to imagine what the battery
life would be like so honestly 1080p is
the highest resolution we really need on
a smart phone at least in the current
form factors and I think it's the
highest resolution that could be at
least somewhat justified considering the
tool those extra pixels take on battery
life and the total cost of the phone on
tablets however it's a whole different
story the bigger screens mean less
pencil density with the same resolutions
so bumping up resolutions to at least
1080p or higher on 7 and 8 inch devices
and up to 4k resolutions on 10-inch
tablets somewhere down the line would
not only make a noticeable difference
but it would also just be downright
amazing and speaking of amazing just put
things into perspective really quick a
fork a 10-inch tablet which is double
the resolution of 1080p would give you a
PPI of around 440 which if you recall is
right around
you're already getting on most 1080p
smartphones today so yeah pretty crazy
okay there are a few other differences
between 1080p and 720p which are
explained in the link to phonebook calm
right below the like button of this
video where you also see a comparison
with a galaxy s2 screen under the
microscope which in case you don't
remember how to resolution of just 800
by 480 so definitely something we're
checking out but that's pretty much it
