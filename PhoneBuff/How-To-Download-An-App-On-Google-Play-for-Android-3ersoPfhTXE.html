calm and in this video i'm gonna show
you how to download an app from google
play and also how to find the high
quality apps that are available on
Google Play as well so first things
first I'm gonna show you how to actually
download an app and the way you do that
is click on an app that you want so for
example let's say I want to download
Adobe Reader I'm just going to tap on
the app page and from here you can press
the install button on the top right so
I'm just gonna go ahead and tap on that
you give to a confirmation page you hit
accept and download and there you go the
app is being downloaded and will be
automatically installed on your Android
phone so that's the first part of that
but for the second part I want to show
you guys how to actually find the high
quality apps that are available alright
so the first step in downloading a high
quality app is to go to your app section
on Google Play and search through either
your categories such as featured your
top paid apps or your top free apps or
look through specific categories such as
business apps communication apps
education entertainment etc or of course
you could just make a search for the app
that you're looking for in this case I
don't necessarily know what kind of I
want let's say I just want to
entertainment app so on top of
entertainment and one thing I do know is
I want it to be free so I can scroll
over to top free and look at the top
free apps that have to do entertainment
so in this case let's say I wanted to
look at mixer to see what it's all about
and you know before it downloaded
there's a lot of things you could do to
actually decide whether or not this app
is for you so first thing at the very
top you see pictures of the app so you
can actually tell whether or not the
user interface is up to your standards
if you like the way it looks
the next thing obviously is the
description you want to read this to see
all the features that it has and to see
you know if this is what you're actually
looking for
next thing is B reviews probably one of
the most important things so in this
case you can see there's been twenty
five thousand five hundred eighty-two
reviews it has the average of 4.4 as far
as the rating goes it has sixteen
thousand five-star ratings and has a one
thousand one-star rating so it gives you
a good idea as far as how good of an app
it is but with Google Play you can
actually take it one step further when
it comes to the reel so what you do is
see all reviews and you actually have
some options right here so you hit
options and you can look at the latest
version so see what the latest update is
as far as their reviews hit okay and you
can see what people are saying about the
latest version of the app or if you
don't wanna do that and you just want to
look at this type of poem so in this
case I have a Galaxy Nexus
it'll only search other people's reviews
who have Galaxy Nexus so this case
there's only one right here and this
person left a four star review or review
another thing you could do is search
through most helpful reviews or the
newest reviews that have been posted
about the app next thing you do is look
at the update that are the most recent
update so in this case it's March 29th
which was about two weeks ago so it
gives you an idea as far as the
developer support and how often they
update the app this case looks like it's
pretty recent so you can assume that
this person or this developer actually
supports app releases new features are
addresses bug bugs that are reported to
them so that just gives idea that it's a
higher-quality app and the last thing
you could check is hit download and
check the permissions that the app
actually asked for for for example in
this case as for storage it asks for
system tools GPS phone calls network
communication and personal information
the reason why you want to check the
permissions is because sometimes if
you're looking at especially not the
ones that are popular but an app that's
fairly new you want to make sure that it
doesn't intrude on your privacy and ask
for things or permissions that it
doesn't need for example a flash of app
shouldn't be asking for your GPS
location so anyway you can look at the
app for example let's say storage why
doesn't even my storage and you tap on
it and it'll give you a description as
far as why what that means so system
tools it'll give you you know why the
app would need system tools and once you
decide that you like it of course you
just hit accept and download and you
know this whole process seems like it's
a long one when I described it but
obviously you could do it in a matter of
seconds and it prevents you from having
to install and uninstall apps which
could just be somewhat tedious and you
know avoid trial and error and instead
go off of
you know the metrics that have been
given to you such as ratings
descriptions and things like that
all right listen for me in this video
this is day of informal calm thank you
