in this video I'm remanufacturing at
least in my mind the perfect android
smartphone based off hardware that's
early out on the market for the month of
june two thousand twelve so you know
leave me comments below if you agree
with me or what you'd rather see in your
version of the perfect smartphone but
for me we'll start the screen and has
got to be that screen on the HTC One X
which is 1280 by 720 p and thats super
lcd2 i was considering the one of the
galaxy nexus in the sgs3 but those guys
use the pen tile layout so I decided you
know from my private phone I would want
to see display on the 1x4 the processor
I want to see the icky nose for quad now
I know that it's not compatible with LTE
networks here in the US but honestly it
is the best performing processor at
least from the benchmarks I've seen I
haven't tested in person but based off a
keynote history as far as the eye can I
was 4210 compared to the Snapdragon s3
and the other processors it outperformed
those guys so I assume that the enkei
notes for quad is going to outperform
these other processors and that's the
one I would choose for my perfect
android smartphone clocked at one point
4 gigahertz now Ram might as you guys
know the galaxy s3 is gonna be coming
with two gigs of RAM for the u.s. and
Canadian versions so obviously I want to
see two gigs on my perfect phone for the
camera it's easy for the front face
interfacer i'll choose the 1.9 megapixel
camera on the galaxy s3 again it's the
highest megapixel count it's going to
shoot in 720p and you know it's going to
have good quality but the guy on the
back um it's kind of a toss about me I
don't know I started which android
phones out there which camera i'll
choose you know it's it's there's close
between a couple but i think you know
from what I've seen and what I've test
from android phones I would go with the
camera on the HTC One S or 1x uh because
I just feel like they shoot the best
picture quality the video cord is really
great under if you watch our video
samples on the channel and the overall
really sad so is so I choose the camera
from the HTC one s for a battery life or
the battery I
it's pretty much an easy choice I choose
the one on the motorola razr maxx it's
33 100 milliamps you know it's like a
thousand more milliamps than any of the
other batteries out there are 1200 more
milliamps than any of the batteries out
there so it's gonna last you longer and
obviously Motorola made it in a way
where it didn't make the device any
thicker I mean didn't make it too thick
it's still under nine millimeters which
it was more than acceptable considering
you have that much battery life um and
the last thing is the storage I want my
purple phone to come with 32 gigabytes
of internal storage with an expandable
micro SD card are expandable by micro SD
card you know I'm kind of frustrated
with manufacturers don't include that
expandable microSD card slot obviously
they do to make the device thinner or
whatever it is but on this phone that's
what I really want to see I want to see
it to be expandable so it can be you
know perfect and other notable features
are NFC capability you know at this
point I kind of expect it to have that
bluetooth 4.0 again something expected
and the operating system I would one
android 4.0 for or the latest version at
the time obviously right now is 4.04 and
I wanted to be stock ICS no manufacturer
you I because you know some people
prefer touch with some people prefer HTC
Sense so I mean honestly I'd rather
scope you know straight from the Creator
which is google and have that pure
Google Android experience so anyway
that's my perfect android smartphone you
may disagree or agree um if you have you
know a different ideas well as for what
a perfect smartphone would be let me
know in the comments below and if you
agree with me let me know too but
definitely would love to see this guy be
manufactured one day I mean I don't
think it ever will be but you know it's
nice to imagine it anyway that's it for
me in this video thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
