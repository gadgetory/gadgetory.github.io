and in this video i have a comparison
for all you sprint users between the HTC
EVO 4G LTE and the sprint version of the
Apple iPhone 4s so I'm just gonna be
doing a speed comparison test here we're
gonna start with a boot up so go ahead
and turn on both phones at the same time
so one two three hold it for a couple of
seconds and let go and that will let
these two guys load up so we can see
which one actually boots up they're
respectable West first of course on the
HTC you have those little boot up
animations where on the iPhone you just
have the Apple logo you can see that the
HTC is actually done so go ahead unlock
the Evo really quick got our widgets got
our home screens loaded and a little bit
of stuttering but now for the most part
we're done Wi-Fi is connected we're
pretty much good to go we're still
waiting on the iPhone 4s there you go
and unlock this guy and it's ready so
obviously winner of that test is the Evo
4G LTE let's go ahead and run a few
applications so you can see in the
background there's no running apps on
here on either phones and of course you
know it's a fresh boot so let's go ahead
and run a couple of apps the first app
will run is the dictionary app now keep
in mind we are comparing two different
os's iOS and Android so the apps can be
written a little bit differently but
this is the best way to really determine
you know your real world experience
we'll get with each phone so let's go
ahead and open up dictionary at the same
time if I can so one two three so load
it up first on the Evo 4G LTE load it up
second on the iPhone let's go ahead and
go to the next app will do Flixter so
one two three again
load it up first on the evo 4G LTE and
second on the iPhone 4s let's go ahead
and go to the next app we'll do score
Center so one two three and again we got
another win for the evo 4G LTE so so far
it's winning three two zero the next app
I'll open up is the WordPress app so
we'll do WordPress one two
three and looks like the iPhone actually
beat it out but because this actually
loads up more content I'll call that a
tie because on the iPhone just close up
the website and then I get the content
so a little bit different but you know
if you really want to be technical the
iPhone technically gets that win but
I'll call it closer to a tie based off
the apps I will go ahead and open up the
calculator so where's the calculator
this case a one two three and load it up
a little bit faster I believe on the
iPhone 4s but I was too close to call
you guys can be the judge of that you
know you guys could write down the
comments if you want and let's do the
camera because that's obvious something
you gonna be using a lot we'll just go
ahead and try to launch the camera on
both phones so I'm gonna try to tap the
two at the same time one two three and
really close I mean that animation was
first on the iPhone 4s but I'm not sure
if they actually opened up at the same
time or school and try that again
because I wasn't paying enough attention
you guys could be the judge
let's go ahead and open up one more time
so one two three yeah so the viewfinder
actually the shows up here first but the
first time I feel like the animation was
made first on the iPhone 4s but I'm
looking at it through my camcorders
viewfinder so I don't have the best you
know view of it so you guys could be the
judge of that one let's go ahead and do
a couple of browser speed tests all
right so before I start the browser
should be test I wanna let you guys know
that it did actually clear out the
browsing history and cache on both
browsers both phones are connected to
the same Wi-Fi network here so we're
gonna get nice even I'm closing out all
the applications that I've opened up
from this test so far so that way it's
gonna be nice and even test go ahead and
launch the browser at the same time and
this one actually has a home screen or a
home website this one doesn't so
obviously this one load it up a little
faster but we're not after that result
we're after as far as which one blows up
a web site first we'll type in foam buff
on both bones all right so let's go
ahead and press go one two three and we
can see the content first on the iPhone
4s but now the evil 4G LTE is actually
done now the iPhone 4s is done so it
looked like as a little bit faster on
the iPhone 4s in the beginning as far as
it populating the content but
the e before GLC actually caught up and
actually loaded up everything first so
that's one test let's go ahead and load
up this article right here so one two
three and same thing again I see the
content first pay attention to the other
things like the ads and you can see this
guy's done this guy's still loading so
let's scroll down you can see it is
still loading some of the content like
the pictures up here right here you can
see there's no pictures where this guy
does have the picture so the win here
does go down on the picture lower so the
windows go to the Evo 4G LTE once again
all right so let's go ahead and try
another website we'll go ahead and go to
Engadget so type in and gadget alright
so let's go ahead and hit go at the same
time one two three there you go so we've
finished a little bit faster on the Evo
4G LTE go ahead and try to load up the
full site this will probably give us the
best idea so let's go ahead and hit
desktop at the same time one two three
and at this time the content actually
populate first on the evo 4G LTE all the
advertisements and whatnot are done
there you go so this guy is done you can
tell this guy's still loading some of
the things up obviously the status part
just finished right now so anyway that's
the test as far as the browser goes
overall me we will pretty much have a
unanimous winner the UFO glt does beat
out the iPhone 4s so if you're on Sprint
and you're looking for the fastest phone
not necessarily the best phone I mean
that's obviously personal purpose we're
feeling the fastest phone I definitely
have to give the edge to the Evo 4G LTE
definitely is then give you a faster
speed as for the processor goes and
we're not even talking about you know
the 4G LTE we're just gonna be running
on Sprint obviously the iPhone 4s
doesn't have that yet so anyway that's
it for me in this video we found it
