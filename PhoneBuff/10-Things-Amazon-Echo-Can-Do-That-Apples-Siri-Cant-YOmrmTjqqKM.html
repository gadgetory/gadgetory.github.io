infrared is super pretty Alexa how do
you feel about Siri Siri is a great app
but I'm different Alexa do you think I'm
fat how about you ask me again later
when you're not stuff in your face full
of crap hmm what's up guys david here in
today's episode of first look when are
we checking out the amazon echos new
skill feature that essentially lets you
download and install apps for the
virtual assistant i haven't tested any
of them out so far so we're gonna be
experiencing them for the first time
together so with that said let's jump
right in
alright so the first one we'll check out
will be Alexa asked animal sounds what a
lion sounds like what animal would you
like to hear next a monkey what animal
would you like to hear next a bird I'm
not good at their noise yet I'm too
embarrassed to try pick a different
animal
alright so another skill is its ability
to play blackjack with you so Alexa
asked the dealer to deal the cards you
have been dealt 9 of clubs and 9 of
spades dealer has whole card and 4 of
clubs hitter stand stand
you have 18 dealer has ace of spades and
4 of clubs dealer hits it's the six of
Hearts dealer stands on 21 dealer wins
ahaha no Alexa asked for a fart Alexa
asked for another part
alexxa ask mom jokes to tell me a joke
your mama's so fat when she goes camping
the Bears hide their food your mom was
so fat that when she was born she gave
the hospital stretch marks
your mom is so fat when she burped New
Orlean thought Katrina came back to
finish the job
oh okay Alexa tell me a dog fact the
Russians trained dogs during World War
Two to run suicide missions with mine
strapped to their backs that's messed up
ooh here's another skill we've got a
game which is capital quiz which quizzes
you on the capitals of all the 50 states
in the US what is the capital of Florida
South Beach and what is the capital of
Utah Salt Lake City no it's not try
again the capital of Utah Salt Lake City
that's what I said with Mississippi I'm
starting to realize I don't know any of
the capitals things like maybe 10
seconds to install an app or enable an
apps what they call it maybe longer than
10 seconds Alexa asked knock knock knock
knock who's there
you don't get off who Adolph ball hit me
in the mouth all right here's the
interesting skills called movie quotes
trivia game okay
okay here is your first movie quote they
call me mr. Tibbs tell me what are you
ready for your next movie quote yes go
ahead make my day
Oh Dirty Harry oh yeah
here is your final movie quote what is a
yute God are going to like me to repeat
the movie quote just say repeat if you
need a hoot just say hint repeat what
famous movie contained the following
line
what is ute four corners no dammit
I've got this eyes on the first thing is
the haha that is too bad
this movie quote was for my class and
finish you to think of response is there
thanks for talks to the game
no luck man
all right so we got another skill that
I'm gonna enable right here it's called
laughs box says laughs box will play and
describe different laughs you should be
laughing as a result oh why is this a
thing
Alexa stop Oh Alexa stop please stop hey
Alexa ask audio goal for a goal
here's another skill it's called a
cañedo
there's an app on Android and on the
iPhone I think that you could ask a
bunch of questions and it's supposed to
guess
no wait you'll get what I'm saying when
I started alexis start a cañedo
think of a real or fictional character
and I will try to guess who this is your
character real person Bugs Bunny let's
see
no is your character a youtuber no is
your character linked with ice no is
your character an FBI agent nope is your
counter linked to five nights at freddys
no this is a long game is your character
a dog is your character connected to
human teeth is your character famous for
their legendary kicks
yeah the app I think works better ever
done it collab with Connor Franta the
most specific question ever no I I'm
done I'm done with it
yeah so there aren't a lot of skills on
the App Store I guess you call it or
skill store right now a lot of them
actually poorly rated from what I'm
seeing here some work well some of them
not so much
overall it's a working process is a
early apps for reminding the days of
when Android first started you know
there's like 12 apps on the app or the
world called by then app market and the
quality wasn't necessarily there but I
think as developers start developing for
this platform I think there's a lot of
stuff you could do that pretty much does
it for me in this video if you liked it
give it a big thumbs up to show you love
and as always I'll see you in the very
next episode
Oh
