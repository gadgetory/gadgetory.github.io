fan earlier this week I had a chance to
swing by the end video booth at CES 2014
to take a closer look at the brand new
processor they announced in the Tegra k1
now technically the k1 is the successor
to the TECA 4 that we saw last year but
for whatever reason Nvidia opted not to
call it the Tegra 5 like you would
expect and instead is calling it the k1
which is probably a good idea by Nvidia
because right off the bat the k1 name
tells you that this new chip isn't just
an upgrade over to TECA 4 and instead at
least for NVIDIA it may very well be a
game changer
so the CPU inside this thing is a 4 core
CPU capable of being clocked at up to
2.3 gigahertz with an additional core or
a companion core for low energy tasks
such as when your phone is on standby
or if you're just using your phone or
tablet for something that doesn't
require a lot of power like reading an
article on a webpage now obviously when
you need more power
the k1 is gonna kick on additional cores
one by one up to a maximum of four so
that way you have a good balance between
performance and battery life but as
interesting as all that sounds it wasn't
the CPU that really got me excited about
the k1 and it's not what really drew me
to the booth at CES and instead it was
the GPU that really caught my eye now
this new GPU is based off the Kepler
architecture which is probably why they
named it the k1 but this architecture is
a first on a mobile ship and is what you
typically find on a desktop class CPU
which means you get support for things
like DirectX 11 OpenGL 4.4 and NVIDIA
zone could of course 6 now that's ND 192
CUDA cores that this GPU has will most
likely combine to give you really really
good graphics and gaming performance so
much so that Nvidia went as far as
saying that the k1 can either match or
surpass the performance on the last gen
consoles like the xbox 360 or the ps3
now I don't know what you guys but I've
been playing GTA 5 recently on my xbox
360 and I think the graphics look really
really good so having graphics like that
on a tablet on a phone would be just
right amazing but of course the
challenge is actually getting games
ported over to Android that can actually
take full advantage of the ke ones power
because right now the games on Android
won't even come close but Nvidia does
say that the game developers will have
an easier time porting the games over
because of the Kepler architectures that
the GPU is based off of now I think the
determining factor in all of this as far
as ice getting games ported over to
Android isn't necessarily the k1 itself
but instead how popular the k1 becomes
because if the k1 is anything like the
Tegra 4 that we saw last year which this
wasn't adopted widely by manufacturers
and never really became mainstream then
game developers won't have any incentive
to port their games over but if the k1
does become popular and it's adopted by
a big manufacturer like Sony HTC Samsung
or someone similar then game developers
just may have enough incentive to do
that and that in and of itself can very
well change the future of gaming on
Android so the NVIDIA Tegra k1 could
very well be a game changer quite
literally but anyways that's pretty much
it for me in this video if you liked it
please give it a thumbs up and make sure
you hit that subscribe button for more
mobile technology videos just like this
thanks for watching and I'll see you
guys in the very next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
