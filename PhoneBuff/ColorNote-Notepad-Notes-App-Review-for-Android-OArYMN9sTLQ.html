and in this video I'll be doing a quick
review on the color note app available
for free on the Google Play Store so
there are a whole bunch of features on
this app so I'm not going to be able to
go over all of them in depth but I'll
try to do a quick overview so first
thing is you can take a note like you
normally would on any other app so just
go ahead and type in note close out the
keyboard really quick you can change the
color of the note and color code them if
you want to whatever color you want
which I find useful if you're you know
having notes for school or notes for
work you can just color code them and
that way they're easy to find later on
you could press menu and you have the
option to discard the note you can send
it through whatever options that Android
gives you you could set a reminder which
is I find really cool so say in 15
minutes I wanted to remind myself of
this note hit done reminder is set in 15
minutes this will open up and remind me
of whatever I wanted to get reminded of
you could also set a lock password on a
specific note which prevents other
people who might be using your phone be
from being able to read your note so
that's definitely great for security for
now I'm just going to hit back and it
automatically saves and hit back back
out of here I want to show you the
checklist functionality so this is just
basically your to-do app let's say I
need to get food and then get a car wash
so get car wash and I hit okay so you
know this is your basic to-do list you
could also title it so let's say to do
it back and it saves again of course I
have the same options to change it and
you know delete it and share them
whatnot as I did with the regular notes
I get back out of here if I want to
search through all my notes I can just
type in a keyword and it will find it
through my notes which is great instead
of having to search through each and
every single one um my favorite feature
though on this app is the ability to add
a widget to your home screen so I'll go
over to the widget and you have two
different sizes or you can do one by one
or two by two
and the today widget is for your
calendar which I'll go into in just a
second but I'm just going to do a
regular two way to color note widget and
I'll do the to-do list that I just made
and what's really cool now you have a
little you know almost posted on your
home screen and you know you have your
to-do list right over here so you'll be
able to see them you know up to like six
things you got more than that you'll
have to open it up and once you do you
can check them off as soon as you get
them done so you just tap on it and it
checks them off so definitely a cool
functionality I really love this I think
it helps my productivity a lot when I
have it on my helm screen let's go back
into the app and look at some of the
other features you kid like I said have
a calendar and kind of like the reminder
we set for ourselves earlier we could
set other reminders we could add a
reminder and things like that
hit back you also have a recycle bin so
it has all your deleted apps or notes a
you can delete them all at once if you
want but you know if you ever
accidentally delete it it stores them in
here which is pretty cool
you could also archive your notes you
can change the theme from light to dark
like that and of course your workspace
is just your regular home screen and you
know your regular where all your notes
show up alright that's pretty much it
for this app review though definitely
recommend it can't beat the price it's
free and I really just love the
functionality especially this widget I
mean I haven't found an app out there
that lets you do it just like this you
know I stack up four at a time sometimes
and I just really helps up alright
that's it for me in this video this
