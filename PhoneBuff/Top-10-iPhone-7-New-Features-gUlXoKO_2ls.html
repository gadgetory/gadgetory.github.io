took the wraps off of the new iPhone 7
and 7 plus and man I've got to tell you
it's a pretty impressive update to what
was already a great phone there's now a
bunch of new features that I've been
wanting to see on an iPhone for quite
some time which has got me more excited
about this year's iPhone than I was
about the last so without any further
ado let's jump right in and take a look
at the top 10 best new features on
Apple's latest flagship top new feature
number one refreshed design I know I
know
we're supposed to be talking about new
features here and the first thing I hit
you with is design which at first glance
the iPhone 7s design looks a heck of a
lot like the iPhone 6 and successes but
there are a few reasons why I've
included design in this list for one
there are two new color options in
addition to the silver gold and pink the
first new color is called
jet black which adds a glossy finish to
the iPhone 7 that makes it look like the
aluminum body blends almost seamlessly
over to the front glass the second
option is called just black and it has a
matte black finish with a smoked out
Apple logo now if you're looking for an
iPhone 7 that looks obviously different
from these 6 and 6s you're going to want
to go with one of the two new black
options but be warned the fancy new jet
black color option will cost you more as
it will only be available on the higher
storage models jet black will also be
more susceptible to micro abrasions so
much so that Apple actually recommends
you to get a case add to that the fact
that the high-gloss finish will be a
fingerprint magnet and all the sudden
the regular matte black color option
looks like the obvious choice at least
for me let me know what you guys are
leaning towards down below in the
comments good news for all the new color
options is the antenna lines are now
more subtle with them only appearing
along the top and bottom edges instead
of across the back and on the new black
color options the antenna lines are
blacked out so they're even less
noticeable and then finally the
aluminium on the back now curved over
the camera hump instead of it just being
flat with a protruding lens which is not
the biggest change in the world but it
is a nice little touch to new home but
the physical home button that has been
on the
i phone since day one is no more with
Apple redesigning the new home button on
the iPhone 7 to be a new solid-state
button that technically works the same
as it did on the iPhone 6s with the only
difference being it doesn't basically
click in instead when you press down on
it you get tablet feedback with the help
of the iPhone sevens new taptic engine
which is now more responsive with a
wider range of frequencies the buttons
click sensitivity can actually be
adjusted in the settings which is the
first of what Apple says are many more
customizations to come now I know a Miss
the physical button and it will take
some time to get used to this solace day
button that only tricks you into
thinking it's clicking in when you press
it but ultimately I think the new button
was the right move for Apple to make as
in theory it should be more durable
since there are no moving parts those of
you who've had an iPhone button that's
gotten stuck are broken know why this
matters and the new button probably
helped make the next feature possible 3
water and dust resistance the iPhone 7
and 7 plus are now ip67 water and dust
resistance with apples sealing the phone
internally and even using adhesives to
help the phone survive the accidental
spill now some of you may be wondering
what the differences between the iPhone
7s ip67 rating and the galaxy s7 ip68
rating
well while IP ratings can vary from
device to device it looks like the major
differences the iPhone 7 can survive
being an up to one meter of water for 30
minutes while the galaxy s7 can survive
in up to 1.5 meters for the same amount
of time
so yeah the galaxy s7 is technically
more water-resistant but honestly when
it comes to accidentally dropping it in
the toilet or even taking it with you in
the shower you should probably be fine
either way it is worth noting that
liquid damage won't be covered by
Apple's warranty so don't go out
swimming with it if you don't have to
for improved display know the iPhone 7
and 7 plus don't have higher resolutions
you still have the same 1334 by 750
resolution on the iPhone 7 and is same
1920 by 1080 resolution on the iPhone 7
plus but that doesn't necessarily mean
that the display themselves haven't been
improved in fact the iPhone 7s display
is now 25% brighter with a typical
maximum brightness of 625 minutes
compared to 500 nits on the iPhone 6s
this should make it a lot easier to see
when outdoors and in direct sunlight the
new display also has a wider color gamut
which Apple says is able to deliver
cinema standard colors with the best
color management in the industry those
are apples words not mine
and if I had a bet I'd say that Samsung
displays still probably have the edge
but nonetheless the colors on the iPhone
7 should pop a bit more which is always
nice top new feature number 5 all new
cameras probably the biggest new feature
on the iPhone 7 is the camera on both
the front and on the back the rear
camera is an all new 12 megapixel sensor
which Apple says is 60% faster and 30%
more energy efficient than the one on
iphone success it is now capable of
taking wider color gamut photos which
work nicely with the improved display
and as a new 6 element lens with an
f-stop of 1.8 compared to 2.2 on the
success which results in 50% more light
getting in than before the iPhone 7 also
gets optical image stabilization which
previously was only available on the
larger plus models allowing it to take
exposures of up to three times longer
than the iPhone 6s which combined with
the higher f-stop should make the photos
you take in low-light look a heck of a
lot better but sometimes even these best
low-light cameras need a little help
from the flash and on the iPhone 7 the
shoot on flash is better than ever with
four different LEDs instead of just two
like on the iPhone success that combine
to be 50% brighter there is also a split
sensor that detects the flicker that
artificial light sometimes produces and
has the camera automatically compensate
for it now those are a lot of
improvements right there but these seven
plus this camera takes things to the
next level instead of 112 megapixel
camera on the back there are now two 12
megapixel cameras one of them is used
for your regular wide photos with an F
1.8 28mm
lenz while the other is a telephoto F
2.8 fifty six millimeter lens which
effectively allows you to do a 2 X
optical zoom that can be increased
digitally up to 10x switching between D
1x and 2x camera is as simple as
pressing the button right above the
shutter letting you zoom in to two X
without losing any image quality or
adding the noise that typically comes
with digital zoom this dual lens setup
also comes with the ability to do depth
of field effects so you can get a nice
blurry background while taking a picture
of someone though this feature won't be
available at launch and will come out
sometime later this year
overall the iPhone 7 plus S camera is a
huge improvement and takes the
smartphone camera one step closer to
acting like a DSLR camera with things
like optical zoom and shallow depth of
field will it replace your DSLR no but
it is one step closer to doing so which
is amazing on a smartphone now the rear
cameras aren't the only cameras to be
improved because we live in a world
where the front-facing camera is
probably used more so than the rear
camera Apple has improved it as well
with the front camera being bumped up to
7 megapixels compared to just five on
the iPhone 6s this should translate into
clearer crisper selfies which may or may
not be a good thing 6 lte-advanced the
iPhone continues this trend of being one
of the most global ready smartphones out
there with the iPhone 7 supporting up to
25 LTE bands it also supports LTE
advanced which can handle data speeds of
up to 450 megabytes per seconds which is
50% faster than what was available on
the success and three times faster than
on the iPhone 6 7 more storage so one of
my favorite new features is the fact
that Apple has finally decided to ditch
the 16 gigabyte base model on the new
iPhones which in this day and age of
high resolution photos and videos just
doesn't cut it anymore the iPhone 7 now
starts at 32 gigabytes at these six
hundred and $49 price points with the
$750 model skipping 64 gigabytes and
jumping all the way up to 128 and then
for you heavy storage users there is now
a whopping 256 gigabyte model available
which will set you back 850 dollars
eight
better performance okay so the iPhone
success is the fastest phone we've ever
tested in our Bumbo style speed tests
but it's still being undefeated after
beating the new note 7 despite being a
year old and from the looks of it the
iPhone 7 is going to be even faster the
new quad-core 810 fusion chip finally
brings a quad-core processor to the
iPhone with to the cores being high
performance cores that results in a CPU
that is 40% faster than the one on the
iPhone success and a six core GPU that
is 50% more powerful than what the a9
was packing all this extra horsepower
can lead to apps and games that were
simply not possible before specifically
with the games with some new titles
launching alongside the iPhone 7 that
supposedly bring near console quality
graphics to your pocket now I'm super
excited about the a10 fusion and it's
about time that the iPhone jumped on to
the quad-core bandwagon so I can't wait
to see what happens any Bumbo style
speed test
thumbs up you're with me nine better
battery life with a faster chip the new
taptic engine and the improved display
you may be wondering what that means for
battery life well Apple says that the
iPhone 7 is going to on average last you
two hours longer than the iPhone success
the iPhone 7 plus on the other hand is
supposedly going to last you one hour
longer than the iPhone 6s plus which was
already a beast to begin with with
battery this extra battery life is
thanks partly to the a10 fusion chip
which again is a quad core with two
high-performance cores that we just
talked about and two low performance
cores that will only be used for tasks
that don't require a bunch of processing
power like checking your emails for
example in the background now this isn't
anything new we've seen quad-core chips
work like this on Android for quite some
time but it's nice to see that Apple is
finally implementing it into the iPhone
10 stereo speakers the iPhone successor
speaker is actually not that bad
compared to phones like the galaxy s7
but thankfully Apple didn't just settle
for the status quo the iPhone 7 now has
dual stereo speakers with one of the
speaker's being at the bottom right
where it was on the iPhone success and
the other new speaker being at the top
by the earpiece this is a similar setup
to what we saw on the HTC 10
so while I'm not sure how it'll perform
just yet Apple does says that is two
times louder and offers increased
dynamic range so while I want to take
the word for it I'm not necessarily
gonna believe it just yet until we test
it but stay tuned alright so there you
have it those are the top ten best new
features on the iPhone 7 and 7 plus the
new phones will become available
starting September 16th with the iPhone
7 coming in at the same price point as
the iPhone success at six hundred and
fifty bucks while the iPhone 7 plus
actually gets $20 more expensive
starting at seven hundred and seventy
bucks anyways that is it for me in this
video we have a bunch of iPhone 7
coverage coming up soon so make sure you
subscribe if you haven't already thank
you guys for watching it as always I'll
see you in the very next episode
