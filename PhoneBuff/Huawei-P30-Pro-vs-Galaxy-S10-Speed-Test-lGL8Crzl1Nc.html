pretty well in our tests it's the first
phone to ever hold two titles
simultaneously being both the bump of
style speed test champ and the fump of
style battery test champ but both of
these titles are on the line with it
going against easily the number one
contender in the huawei p30 Pro now the
battery test is coming soon so be sure
to subscribe if you don't want to miss
out on that but today's video of course
is about speed and taking a look at the
spec sheets man both of these phones are
packing a punch they both have 8
gigabytes of RAM while the p30 pro is
rocking high silicon's Kirin 980 chip
and the S 10 plus variant that we're
testing here is powered by qualcomm
snapdragon 855 of course we already did
the DX notes for snapdragon speed test
and you know there was a difference I'll
be linking that video down below in case
you missed it but I'm excited to see
what happens here today Huawei and
Samsung are the two top Android
manufacturers in the world but after
this B test only one of them can be
champ
after the test you can find the official
fumble of style rankings on our website
at the link below which we created with
a sponsor of today's video in Wix so
with Wix making a website has never been
easier whether you use the drag-and-drop
editor on a computer like I did or you
use wix's artificial design intelligence
to build a site for you literally using
only your phone you can be up and
running in at no time after choosing a
theme and answering just a few basic
questions best parts you can start your
website and try it all out for free at
the special link down below okay so
we'll get things going by starting the
stopwatches on each phone and then
jumping into the first row where the sm+
is able to get the small step over the
p30 pro in facebook but in starbucks
both walls load the app at exactly the
same rate we'll see if there's any
difference here in word where each phone
is gonna load the same 500 page
documents and yes the galaxy of 10 plus
is able to load it quicker improving on
its lead as we head into excel where
while the SMS finishes first the p30 pro
actually loaded excel faster cutting
down on the s 10 plusses lead only to
fall right back behind with it taking
significantly longer for its selfie cam
to focus and properly expose before
taking that photo causing it a two
second delay as the sm+ moves on to
premiere the P 30 pro is exporting that
edited photo in Snapseed at a painfully
slow rate giving the S 10 plus some
major cushion as it works on finishing
the video exporting tasks at about the
same time that the P 30 first began with
the export and from the looks of it the
B 30 pro is exporting the video clip at
a slower rate as well allowing the sm+
to capture its biggest lead of the test
so far with it already working on subway
surfers so for the P 30 Pro to have a
shot at making the comeback it's going
to have to do it here in the gaming row
and you know while it still has a lot of
ground to make up the P 30 is moving in
the right direction with it loading
subway surfers at a faster rate cutting
into what is now a pretty significant
lead that the s 10 plus has over it
building on his performance in subway
surfers the P 30 Pro manages to load
flip diving at ace
slightly faster rates and it does an
even better job and fit the fat so
huawei's flagship isn't going down
without a fight it still has its work
cut out for it as the galaxy has time
plus is now on the last row of this
first lap where it blew through Spotify
and is just about done with ESPN and the
p30 pros stuttering as it exited
boulevards didn't do anything to help it
with the SM plus racing through Netflix
and Amazon completing the first lap
first with the time of 1 minute and 57
seconds with the Peter T Pro taking 8
seconds longer to do the same clocking
in a time of 2 minutes and 5 seconds
here in the second lap it'll be
interesting to see if what we has
improved on its RAM management
considering that last time when we
tested the may 20 Pro which has the same
eight two gigabytes of RAM found in the
p30 Pro it wasn't able to keep all the
apps open in the background but so far
the p30 Pro doesn't look like it's
having any issues which honestly no
phone with 8 gigabytes of RAM ever
should the sm + finishes the test first
with a total time of 2 minutes and 32
seconds with the p30 Pro coming in just
7 seconds later with a time of 2 minutes
and 39 seconds making the winner and
still fumble of style speed test champ
the galaxy s 10 Plus for the updated
speed test rankings be sure to check out
our website at the link below which we
created easily with our sponsor wix's
drag and drop editor anyways that is it
for me in this video thank you guys for
watching and as always I'll see you in
the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
