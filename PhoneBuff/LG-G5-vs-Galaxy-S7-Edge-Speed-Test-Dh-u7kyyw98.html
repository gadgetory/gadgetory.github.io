what time it is today we're doing a
speed test between the u.s. variants of
the galaxy s7 and the LG g5 which means
that both phones have these same
Snapdragon 820 processor the same quad
HD resolution and the same amount of RAM
under the hood so at least on paper both
of these devices should offer similar
performance but as you guys know spec
sheets alone don't always translate into
real-world performance and that's
exactly why we do these foam of style
speed test here on the channel so with
that said let's go ahead and jump right
in okay so we'll get things going by
starting these stopwatches on each phone
and then do what we always do and jump
straight into the first row of system
apps where the g5 loads these settings
up just a hair faster than the galaxy s7
giving it the slight lead as both phones
work on Angry Birds now I know some of
you may be wondering why we're using
these snapdragon variant of the galaxy
s7 instead of the X and O's variant and
the reason is for one the g5 we're
testing here is a US version so it's
only fair to use a US version of the s7
and second we want to know how well
Samsung optimizes the s7 for the
Snapdragon 820 compared to how LG did
with the g5 and since both phones have
nearly identical specs optimization will
be the key differentiator in this speed
test
so as the s7 works on Photoshop makes
the g5 inches further ahead with it
working on laps it where each one will
have to create a time-lapse from the
same exact video file now since both of
these phones are using the same exact
processor there shouldn't be too much of
a difference here but for whatever
reason the g5 did it about 10% faster
than the s7 pushing it further ahead in
the speed test but the galaxy s7 isn't
too far behind with still plenty of apps
left for it to make a potential come
back and that comeback may just come in
the second lap if the g5 isn't able to
keep as many apps open in the background
as the s7 but before we find out the g5
has to finish this last leg of this
first lap by loading both the mobile and
desktop versions of the Amazon website
and it does so with ease finishing up
the first lap with the time of
minute and 27 seconds with the galaxy s7
still hot on its heels finishing just 5
seconds later with a time of 1 minute
and 32 seconds and oh the g5 isn't able
to keep Angry Birds open in the
background and neither is the s7 so both
bones struggling here in the second lap
so we may just see a repeat of what we
saw in the first lap unless one of these
phones could one-up the other and earn
itself a definitive win by having at
least one or two more apps ready to go
so after having to reload clash of clans
the g5 does have smash hit ready to go
as it does Photoshop mix so this could
just be where the g5 runs away with it
but the S event isn't gonna give up
quite yet within also having smash hit
and Photoshop ready as well as laps it
but it fails to keep ESPN open so the g5
finishes the test with a total time of 2
minutes and 17 seconds and the s7
continues to struggle falling even
further behind as it loads up Spotify
and the Amazon website finally finishing
with a total time of 2 minutes and 32
seconds making the winner the LG g5 that
is it for me in this video thank you
guys for watching it as always I will
see you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
