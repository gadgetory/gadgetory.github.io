bluff calm and in this video I'll be
doing a series of torture tests on the
Nokia Lumia 920 to see just how durable
the phone actually is so this is the
phone from the drop test that I did a
few days ago as you can see there are
some little scuff marks on the corners
and actually what I want to show you is
the left edge because on the drop test
it actually looked a lot worse but it
was mostly the asphalt that I dropped it
on most of it wiped off so so far it's
paired really really well as far as the
drop test now when we take it into the
next level I'll be dropping a mallet on
it a knife scratching with keys and then
finally we'll be using as a hammer to
see if that's going to crack the screen
so let's go ahead and start first thing
we'll do is going to be the keys because
that's probably the easiest one for it
to pass so I'm gonna scratch both the
front and the back to see you know how
fair so first we'll do the back so I'll
just pick this key I guess and I'll
start scratching away so I am applying
pressure you know I'm not doing it
lightly by any means so I'll go over the
camera lens to just kind of give you an
idea so basically I mean obviously
you're never gonna be actually
scratching your phone with your keys
hopefully but you might you know keep
your phone in the same pocket as you
keep your keys and you know over a bunch
of days it might actually you know
affect it like this so anyway it looks
like it did absolutely nothing I mean I
don't see not even one mark from that
test let's see the camera and looks
pretty good so like you can see some
light scratches right here but I mean it
doesn't even show up like you have to
really put it at an angle and get
lighting on it and then you can see
those little light scratches but uh-huh
really really good so far so the back
seems pretty sturdy as far as when it
comes to scratching a key on it so now
let's do the screen itself so first
we'll show you know what it looks like
before didn't really take any damage
from the drop test when I dropped it the
other day the screen looks pretty good I
mean it didn't seem to actually do
anything so we'll go ahead and use a key
on it directly so again applying a whole
bunch of pressure
and I was gonna rub the keys on it all
right so let's see how it fared so um
looks pretty good I can't really see any
noticeable scratches I'm go ahead and
wipe it off with my shirt all right so
now that I cleaned it we get a better
idea and again doesn't look like there's
any signs of damage I mean this the keys
almost seemed like it didn't even affect
the screen so again really really good
so as far as the key test goes it looks
like the Nokia Lumia 920 passes so let's
take it to the next level we got to go a
little bit more extreme we're gonna be
using a knife now how can they actually
be slashing your phone pretty much never
hopefully but this is going to give you
a good idea as far as you know how it'll
hold up if you were to drop it if you
were to put it you know with keys and
all that stuff so anyway we'll go ahead
and start slashing away all right so we
can see that the camera lens cover does
actually take some damage but the
polycarbonate material on the bag
doesn't seem to be showing that much so
let's see what happens so you can
definitely see the scratch marks now so
the knife definitely is gonna scratch it
you see the lens to stick some damage
well gonna try to wipe it off my shirt
and see what happens all right so I
wiped it off and you know what while
they're still you know the scratches
still show up it doesn't look as bad so
basically is some of that you know
residue but for the most part it looks
really good you know really impressed by
this again I mean yeah you're going to
see the scratches but it's not going to
be like noticeable so it's not going to
pretty much make your phone look bad so
that's pretty impressive let's go ahead
and try the screen so we'll wipe off the
screen we'll take a look at the screen
before hand again looks perfectly fine
right now and now let's put this
gigantic knife onto the screens oh and I
will do at an angle and we'll do a
little bit of stabbing
all right now that should definitely do
something is this residue from the
previous test and looks good to see if
the screen is working and yeah it's
still working
so looks like it passed this test again
I mean I don't really even see not even
noticeable marks right now I'll go and
try to wipe it off my shirt and yeah I
mean I don't see anything I mean on
cameras can be kind of hard to see to
begin with but in person you know
looking at it
I don't see any like any signs of any
scratches at all so really impressive
all right so let's do let's choose a
side because if usually the phone
subtract really easily on the side so
all right so I slashed away at that and
that definitely did some damage so you
can see made some markings all over the
side and we'll go ahead and try to wipe
it off see what happens all right so I
try to wipe it off now this seems to be
the most damage is taken so far and
typically what I found with phones is
the sides tend to be you know a little
bit worse off when it comes to
durability and that's because you know
it's a thinner area and it's going to
take more of the damage or more of the
hit so basically you know the knife one
is slashing across it really made a
difference and you can see it does show
definitely you know scratch marks so in
that test I'd say you know it's a fail
but so you know did pretty good
considering but as far as the side it a
you know it didn't do as good the back I
mean honestly looks pretty much like
it's almost like brand-new the front
looks like brand-new so pretty much what
you might have to worry about is the
sides just like on the drop test we had
to worry about the corners but
everything else seemed to be fine so
let's go ahead and let's take it to the
next level now we're actually to be
getting the mallet and dropping that
trying to see if we could crack the
screen so we'll go ahead and leave the
screen on so first I'll just drop it so
I'm going to go like about six inches
above the screen or so and then first
I'm going to drop it and then after if
it survives I want to you know put some
more pressure so let's go ahead and drop
it
all right so let's go a little higher
school like eight inches up alright
let's go ahead and see what happened
touch screen seems to be working just
fine all my icons rearrange somehow but
touchscreen seems to be working just
fine and no noticeable signs of damage
so again really really good so now you
know what let's put some pressure on it
it's actually try to crack this thing so
I'm actually you know slamming it pretty
hard so and nothing happened all right
so really impressive I mean I was
smacking the heck out of the thing you
guys probably heard the force I was
doing in you know what looks really
really good the screen seems to be
working just fine so pretty much as if
nothing happened to so that's really
impressive now let's take it to the next
level I'm gonna use the phone as a
hammer itself so I'm actually going to
get a piece of wood over here so let's
bring that in and where's my nail there
it is alright so it's gonna be kind of
hard to set up I want to slam my finger
so we'll go ahead and use this little
tool right here and alright let's go
ahead and use it as a hammer whoops well
that didn't work
hold it a little harder alright so again
uses a hammer
all right so we got that thing in there
it's at the screen so you can see the
markings that it made see if that wipes
off so it does wipe off it looks good
and it's wait for it does the screen
work and it does and just to prove that
the you know nail is in there you can
see it is in there so pretty darn
impressive um honestly I don't know what
else to do as far as this test goes
we're gonna be taking it to the next
level in the very next video to see just
how much punishment this phone could
take before it cracks and I mean that
literally so make sure you subscribe for
that if you found this video helpful in
the sense that showed you how durable
the Nokia Lumia and Tunney actually is
