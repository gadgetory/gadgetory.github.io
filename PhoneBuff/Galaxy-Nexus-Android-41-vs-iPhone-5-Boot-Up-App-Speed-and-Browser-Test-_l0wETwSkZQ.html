comm in this video we're doing a speed
prepares to test between the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus in this case the unlock
hspa+ version and the apple iphone 5 to
see which phone is faster out of the
tube now you may be wondering you know
why the heck would I even be doing a
speech as between these two devices
considering the iPhone 5 is brand
spanking new and the Galaxy Nexus almost
a year old witch in the world of
technology is a really really long time
but the reason why I'm doing is because
one the Galaxy Nexus is still the
current flagship Nexus device from
google and two it's running the latest
version of Android jellybean 4.1 point
one with all the project butter
enhancements so it should be able to
hold its weight so what that said we'll
go ahead and start the speed test I'll
start off with a boot up test press and
hold both power buttons at the same time
and let them load their respective
voices while they're loading unless you
know that both devices are connected to
the same Wi-Fi network I cleared out the
browsing history on both devices and
also when I do the application speed
test and we're using apps made by the
same developers so those are different
os's it's the closest thing to you know
the real world experience a real world
test when it comes to apps so you see
the iphone 5 did win the boot up test
here i can unlock it and it's still
searching for the network now the Galaxy
Nexus is done now this guy to have a sim
card in so it's not going to be
searching you know for any network I
might give the devices a couple of
seconds to a load of things in the
background and before it started the
application speed test I want you I want
you guys to you know pay attention not
only to you know which phone loads up
the application faster and I suspect
that iphone 5 is gonna be loading a lot
of the apps faster considering its newer
and running iOS which is you know Barry
speed optimized but also beat them to
how big of a difference it is so that
way you kind of see know what the next
Nexus device will look like you know
once I picked that against this guy so
let's go ahead and load up Google Earth
so tap earth at the same time on both
devices and that one looked just about
you know the same as far as load speed
time so I mean pretty impressive as
having to call it a tire and I both are
loading up New York City right now
really close the Galaxy Nexus 3d
buildings turned on of course on Google
Earth on the iphone it doesn't have 3d
buildings or doesn't have that option so
we'll go ahead and back out of here got
a call that one a draw we'll go ahead
and load up the next application we're
just going to be flixster so tap on at
the same time so the iphone 5 did you
know when by a significant margin here I
mean obviously both of them open up
really fast so I mean that's a
significant margin will go ahead and tap
on a movie and again we see the content
a little bit faster than iphone 5 so we
have to give the win to the iphone 5
there let's go to next step so yahoo is
part tacular again we're seeing these
scores already and now we're seeing it
on the Galaxy Nexus so another one for
the iphone 5 and what apps do we have
left will do YouTube so we saw the
startup page first on the iphone 5 let's
see which one goes is the content first
um that was really close I mean
technically it looked like the iphone 5
was finished loading first far as the
pictures and that's only because it
doesn't show you as much content because
it's still not you know adjusted for the
larger display on the iphone 5
letterboxing right now so i'll call that
one a tie honestly because it was pretty
much too close so go ahead and back out
and let's go ahead and run another
application suite has to do Ted so
openly shut one up yeah definitely
faster on the iphone 5 there so there
was you know up at least a one second
difference between the two here so
overall for those five apps you know
it's a the edge went to the iphone 5
because it was only one actually won all
the other ones were tied as far as
Google Earth and YouTube so we'll go
ahead and let's load up the calculators
now obviously these are you know
differently coded I'm ended up all the
apps are differently coded but these
ones you know aren't available on both
the West's so we'll go ahead and open up
the calculator you know for the nexus in
the calculator for the iphone 5 and see
which one opens up bastards are 123 so
both them opened almost instantly but it
was
little bit faster on the iphone 5 not
sure if does just the transition
animation or just the sheer processing
power but really really close but you
have to give the edge to the iphone 5
let's go ahead and see the camera
because this one's gonna be a little
more interesting as far as which one's
going to let you capture that Kodak
moment faster and uh yeah it's a little
bit faster than iphone 5 again so when
there is a difference it's about a
second or so and that's pretty much it
for the apps let's go ahead and start
doing the browser speed test so I'm
gonna load up a couple of websites to
test and we'll see which phone gives you
a faster web browsing experience so go
ahead and open up each browser and we'll
go to foam ball first all right so I did
a quick google search for phone wealth
main reason I'm doing this because I
don't want google chrome to use his
preload and future to kind of you know
change the results so we'll go ahead and
tap on the first link and see which one
goes up the site faster seeing the
contact first on the iphone 5 and the
iphone 5 says it's done you can see all
the ads are not what not and now the
Galaxy Nexus is done so i'll take maybe
about two or three second difference
there we'll go ahead and tap on an
article and again we're seeing the
content first on the iphone 5 the
youtube embedded video picture for the
embedded video and now we're seeing it
on the Galaxy Nexus go again maybe about
two seconds there let's go ahead and try
another website will go to New York
Times all right so we'll tap on the
first link and again we're seeing the
content first on the iphone 5 and uh
we're actually at the mobile site over
here but this actually finished just
about the same time as a mobile site get
over here so that kind of you know shows
you the difference here as far as the
you know which one loads up faster i
mean this one loaded up the full website
with all the pictures and all the
content where this guy take the same
amount of time to load up just the
mobile site so pretty impressive for the
iphone 5 i will do one more test will go
to let's say NFL com see if we actually
you know see if both of them load the
same type of website I so go ahead and
tap on the first link and this time
they're both going to the mobile site
and we're seeing the pictures we got a
little pop-up or you know a promotion to
download their app go ahead and X out of
there same thing over here so again
faster on the iphone 5 I think that
pretty much you know gives you a clear
idea as far as the speed difference
between the two we'll go ahead and run a
browser mark benchmark just to give you
a score look at so I'll go ahead and hit
run benchmark and kind of skip through
the whole process of that where you guys
can see the final result
I so the browser mark benchmark is done
on both devices and you can see that the
iphone 5 disc or higher with the score
of 187,000 608 compared to the score of
100 9591 on the Galaxy Nexus so both are
actually really high scores of course
the iPhone 5 is a lot higher I want to
say that this is the highest score i've
seen you know in any mobile device i
tested the galaxy note 10.1 tablet with
that I quino's processor two gigs ram
and that scored like 160,000 so this is
really really impressive to me but
that's pretty much it for that browser
test yeah so overall I mean you're going
to get a lot better device in 9.5
compares to the Galaxy Nexus but we kind
of already knew that obviously I'm
pretty impressed with the performance
that you know the Galaxy Nexus gave up
with that you know android 4.1 point one
jellybean optimization arm really
excited to see the next next device when
we're pitting it against the iphone 5 so
definitely stay tuned for that so
