we're gonna be checking out the moon bow
beam by a fuse chicken which is your
typical USB cable except for on steroids
so not only can use it to charge and
sync your phone but you can also use it
as a stand and as a dog for your phone
this guy here is made to work
specifically with iPhones with lighting
adapters so the 5 5 s 5c
6 &amp;amp; 6 plus if you have an older
generation iPhone or if you have an
Android phone
I believe you chicken does make this
accessory for those devices as well but
I'm not 100% sure so I'll be putting any
links I find down below in the
description so check that out if you
guys are interested but moving on it's
going to check out the back of the box
where there are a number of different
benefits listed so all doc all cable all
the time virtually indestructible one
legged tripod and the one I find most
interesting is everything is better at
eye level which is what you see depicted
here in this picture but that's the
outside of the box go ahead and check
out what is on the inside shall we so
you have the cable itself which is a
little bit heavier than your typical
cable but that's because it's wrapped in
metal and then uh other than that
the only thing in here is a Quick Start
Guide pretty simple accessory we don't
need that let's go ahead and unwind this
oh we hear that sounds pretty damn
rugged actually so huh on one end you
have the USB cable that you're going to
plug into your wall adapter to your car
charger if you plan on using this in
your car or to your laptop which we're
gonna be testing a little bit later on
in the video on the other end you have
your lighting adapter where you're gonna
plug the phone itself in and then if you
move it to the side you can see this
little flap here
which is going to support your phone and
keep it nice and snug so that way it
doesn't fall over while you are docked
so uh the basic idea at least according
to the pictures on the box is to use the
cable itself to create a solid base and
uh they use little loops so we're gonna
go ahead and do the same exact
so uh create a loop underneath and get
our iPhone dock it on the ego works
pretty well so that's pretty cool
actually
now using it in portrait is probably
best for maybe periscoping and video
chatting we're gonna watch a YouTube
video or a movie even you're always
going to want to use it in landscape
might have to create a wider stance to
help you know get a center of gravity
going but there you go
actually it's a little bit wobbly so a
little bit of tinkering it's not rocket
science you just need a common sense
understanding of physics but there you
go it works and I you totally be able to
watch videos and maybe even movies on
here but actually it looks like the
headphone jack is a little bit blocked
so I don't think I'm gonna be able to
use headphones at least not on the
iPhone 6 and probably not these smaller
iPhones either let's try it on the
iPhone 6 plus actually I think yeah
because it's wider you're going to be
able to use headphones no problem with
the iPhone 6 plus but probably not with
the smaller iPhones so I would keep that
in mind if you plan on using headphones
or if you want to use this in your car
with the auxiliary port now what last
thing I want to check out is connecting
this thing to a laptop just to see how
it works as a second screen so we'll
pull this guy in alright so we got this
plugged in we'll go ahead and create
another base for ourselves so right
about there seems good but doc the
iPhone six-plus and there you go alright
man that is actually pretty damn cool
especially with a laptop you have such
limited screen real estate so having a
second screen and one that's actually
with you all the time it's pretty cool
man I like it I could definitely put
Twitter on here while I'm editing videos
that's dope alright um that's pretty
much it for me in this video I mean it's
a simple accessory not much more to say
about it but if you like this video if
you enjoyed it and want to see more like
it make sure to hit that thumbs up
button to show your support and up as
always I'll see you guys in the very
next episode
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
