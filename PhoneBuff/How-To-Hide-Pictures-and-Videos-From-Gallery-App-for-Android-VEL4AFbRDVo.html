and in this video I'm going to show you
how to hide pictures and videos from
showing up in your Android gallery so
for example let's say I wanted to hide
all the pictures that show up in my Cruz
2011 folder right here so you do have to
make a folder or an album and you could
place all the pictures that you don't
want to show in there and then you can
hide it so I'm gonna show you how to do
that so what you're gonna do is download
a file explorer or file manager if you
don't already have one from Google Play
they're for free
I recommend ES File Explorer but go
ahead and open it up and go to the
picture or album that you want to hide
so for example go to pictures and cruise
2011 so say I wanted to hide it press
and hold to bring up this little pop-up
menu hit rename and all you gotta do is
put a little period or a dot in front of
the name of the album hit okay and boom
you get you see is even hidden from my
file explorer now don't worry it didn't
actually do lead off your phone if you
want to see them in your file manager
just go over to the settings go to file
settings and make sure that the hidden
files are showing hidden files is
checked so that way when I go back it'll
show up see dot dot are on same period
cruise 2011 so it shows up but yet when
I go to my gallery it's open sky up so
right now it's showing
I just gotta force a refresh so hit
refresh if applicable on your phone if
not just close the app or reset your
phone and it should do the job so I'm
just gonna go ahead and close this app
out really quick and let's go back into
it alright so you can see that a number
of photos that I have in here is
actually going down by the second so one
six two one forty six and so on that's
because it's scanning my phone phones
my whole phone's memory and because that
dot is in front of that album it's
realizing that it shouldn't show all
those pictures inside of this gallery so
we're just gonna wait for it to
completely vanish it's at eight five
there you go now it's completely gone
and
anytime you go into your Android gallery
it won't show up so you could put videos
in there you could put pictures in fact
I had both of them in there and it won't
show up as long as you leave that period
in front of the album's name all right
that's it for me in this videos David
Pumbaa calm thank you for watching it
and don't forget to visit fumble comm
from where cell phone news reviews and
how to's thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
