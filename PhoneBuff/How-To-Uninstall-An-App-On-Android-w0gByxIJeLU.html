calm and today i'll be doing a really
simple how-to video and that's how to
delete or uninstall an app from your
android phone so the two apps there's
two different methods of doing this and
i'll show you both and that two apps on
will be doing it on is the facebook
messenger and google books so just to
clear something up pressing and holding
on the icon from your home screen and
drag it into the low trash bin doesn't
actually delete the app like it would on
iOS or the on the iphone you actually
have to uninstall it so to do that the
first method is press been you and go to
settings and from the settings options
you want to go to applications and then
from applications just jump right into
manage applications and you'll see a
list of all the apps you've downloaded
you may need to switch around tabs up
here to find your app but since mine
show up right here i'll just go ahead
and do it from here so I'll hit
messenger and you can see at the very
top right uninstall so I'm gonna go
ahead and tap uninstall
it says uninstall application just wants
a confirmation just hit OK and that's it
pretty simple stuff now I'll show you
how to do it the other method which is
from the Android Market itself so let me
open up the market what you want to do
from here is press menu again and then
click on my apps so you see if I have a
few of my apps these ones need updates
and here your Google Books is what I
want to uninstall I'll just press on it
and you can see right here is the option
to open or uninstall it I'll just hit
uninstall says the application be
uninstalled hit okay and it uninstalls
it for you I mean it's simple as that
and that's pretty much it thank you for
watching the video again this is Dave
