calm and today I just want to show you
the difference between an AMOLED screen
like on the Galaxy Nexus and a non
AMOLED screen like on the HTC hd7 so
it's not a comparison between the two
phones by any means it's just comparing
the screens and this one happens to not
be an AMOLED it's an LCD and of course
this one is AMOLED so what I'm going to
do is I'm actually going to open up a
picture of a black background so let's
load this guy up alright so I want to
show you different so take a look the
screen on this phone um this really
watch the screen now I'm going to turn
the display off and uh you'll notice
that the color actually changes so I'll
do it one more time let me unlock whoops
alright so try see don't focus on this
little part but focus on the whole
screen and then there you go so
hopefully that comes through on camera
um the screen you get clearly tell that
when you have it on die the pixels are
actually on right here and when you turn
it off you know all the pieces turn off
now in this case of the AMOLED screen
I'll go ahead and do the same thing so
you can see well my screen is really
dirty alright um so you can see the
screen um looks off right now
but it's actually on so I'll go and turn
it off and other than that little
animation it looks exactly the same so
that's the difference between AMOLED and
non AMOLED screens is the blacks don't
light up so it saves you battery life
because the pixels are actually off on
the screen so right now it's on I'll
throw it off and solve so it looks
exactly the same because it is the same
because if you have a black background
on here all the pixels are off we're on
LCD screen or any other type of screen
the pixels that are black are actually
lit up so that's what you get richer
darker blacks on an AMOLED screen you
don't other ones that's why I having a
black background helps you on an AMOLED
screen because it saves you better live
alright let's see for me in this video
this is Dave boom bop calm
