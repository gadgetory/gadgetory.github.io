have a three-way speed test between
arguably some of the fastest Android
phones in the world we've got the Google
pixel to excel which is running pure
Android 8.0 we've got the Galaxy Note 8
which has proven itself to be a solid
performer and of course we got the champ
the undefeated the one plus five now
take it a look at the spec sheets all
three phones being powered by the same
snapdragon 835 processor but when it
comes to ram these things are all over
the place the pixel to excel has four
gigabytes of RAM the Galaxy Note 8 has a
respectable six gigabytes of RAM and the
home plus five just went overboard with
it with a whopping eight gigabytes of
RAM so the question is what will plus
five remain at the speed set champ or
well one of the other two defeated and
take the throne let's find out this
episode is brought to you by cats crash
arena turbo stars so if you've ever
watched battle bots cats is very similar

the link down below and use promo code
cats underscore buff you can get free
end game crystals for a limited time so
check it out today
alright you guys know the drill we'll
kick things off by starting to stop
watches on each phone and then jump
right into the first row of system apps
where all three phones are able to snap
that selfie and run through the other
system apps with relative ease with no
phone being able to really establish a
lead however going into Photoshop it
does seem like the pixel 2 in the
oneplus 5 get this step over the note 8
so let's see if either one of them can
pull even further ahead here in laps it
wear from the looks of it the pixel 2 is
able to complete it at a faster rate
allowing it to take the lead halfway
through this first lap with the Wampus 5
right there behind it and the note aides
falling into third but at this point
this is still anybody's race with all
three phones really close to one another
and with us still having plenty of apps
left to go but for now the pixel is able
to improve on its lead already moving on
to fit the fats with the note 8 actually
closing in on the oneplus 5 after
loading flip diving at
to rate now it is worth noting that out
of the bunch the Galaxy Note 8 processor
has the lowest clock speed with Samsung
under clocking it to 2.3 gigahertz
compared to the higher 2.4 gigahertz on
the pixel and the 1 + 5 so that may in
part explain why the node 8 has fallen a
bit behind here and speaking of falling
behind the pixel 2 stuttered there as it
exited bullet force allowing the Wampus
5 to take the lead while the node 8
actually managed to load bullet 4 is the
fastest of the three putting it neck and
neck with the pixel as all three phones
move on to Netflix so in interesting
turn of events here in the first lap the
1 + 5 was able to make the comeback with
a finishing the first stop at the time
of 1 minute and 21 seconds the pixel
finishes just 2 seconds later with the
time of 1 minute and 23 and the node 8
comes in 2 seconds after that with the
time of 1 minute and 25 so really not
that big of a difference between 83 in
the first lap so the bigger difference
may be here in the second lap where the
pixel choose 4 gigabytes of RAM maxes
out with it failing to keep subway
surfers open allowing the node 8 to
catch up to it and pass it but there's
no catching up to the 1 + 5 with it
completing the test and an impressive 1
minute and 45 seconds as the pixel 2
continues to struggle here in the second
lap with a failing to keep Photoshop
open as a note 8 takes that final selfie
on its way to clocking in a time of 1
minute and 56 so will fast for the pixel
to the finish line where after having to
reload a few more apps it finishes a
test with a time of 2 minutes and 9
seconds making the winner and still
fumble style speed test champ the 1 + 5
okay so here the individual app load of
times from the first cloud where you can
see that well it wasn't the fastest and
loading all the apps the 1 plus 5 did
deliver the most consistent results
across the board anyways that is it for
me in this video thank you guys for
watching and as always I'll see you in
the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
