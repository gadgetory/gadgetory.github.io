video we're doing a scratch test on the
zag invisible shield screen cover I got
it here on my samsung galaxy s3 and I'm
gonna put it you know to the test so
we'll go ahead and start with a few
tests so I'll go ahead and start with
the pen test and I'm not gonna you know
actually have to pen out it's gonna do
the little edge right here it's pretty
thin on the edge so maybe it'll do
something so I'll go ahead and kind of
scratch away at it so let's kind of go
like that a few times I'm doing it
pretty hard too and you can see it did
leave some indentions in there it's most
almost like kind of just push the screen
cover in a little bit and see if I can
wipe that off doesn't really look like
it's wiping off all that well but you
know that's I mean let's see if it
actually protects the screen itself so
that's one test let's do the key test
now so let's get my car keys right here
and we'll just do this bottom side right
here so scratch the bottom right side
and kind of see some debris right here
and let's wipe that off and not too bad
over here I mean same little indentions
but nothing big really and then we'll go
ahead and try the scissors real quick so
let's open up these scissors pretty
sharp actually so gotta be careful
all right so we'll just do this edge
right here pretty sharp so let's do what
edge haven't I done let's do the bottom
left so bottom left and I am applying
pressure I'm not you know turn it
lightly you can see based off of also
like residue that it's leaving so anyway
wipe that off and again kind of similar
results now you know it is does look
scratched up so definitely not the
prettiest screen cover now um final test
will be this uh power tool real quick so
we'll go ahead and turn on I'm just
kidding I don't think a tower screen
cover I'm not gonna do that though
because this is my phone and see if the
camera focus again alright so um I'm
gonna go ahead and pull this guy off and
go ahead and see you know how it held up
so actually
I do that let's do one final test let's
go crazy without my keys so let's do and
go in circles like this really
scratching it really you know putting a
lot of pressure on here and show you
guys that so yeah scales a little swirly
as I made alright let's go ahead and
take it out and see how it fared
all right um check this guy off screen
cover you know then it really doesn't
really look all that well I mean I don't
know I'm kind of a perfectionist I like
my screen covers even my screen covers
looking perfect God stops my finger all
right why struggle to get that office go
ahead and show you the screen and as you
can see bringing you no scratches
whatsoever just kind of wasted you know
15 bucks on the screen cover but just
wanted to show you guys how it looks um
as you can see absolutely perfect and
definitely a screen cover I recommend
honestly the reason why I did this video
is because I like this case right here
and when I put the case and the screen
cover together it kind of bubbles up so
I figured I might as well put it through
its paces so anyway that's it for me in
this video if you found it helpful
