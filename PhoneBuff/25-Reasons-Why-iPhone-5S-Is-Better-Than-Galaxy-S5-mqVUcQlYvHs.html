by $6.00 shirts what's up guys david
here from bomba and i am back with yet
another two-part video series this time
comparing the Samsung Galaxy s5 in the
Apple iPhone 5s now if you've been
subscribed to the channel for long
enough you know that we don't do your
typical comparisons here a follow-up and
instead like we've been doing since all
the way back in 2012 we do it indeed
often imitated but originally found here
phonebook style where we do two videos
looking at a bunch of reasons why each
of these smartphones could be considered
better than the other so that way after
watching both videos you can get a much
better idea as to which phone is
actually the better phone for you let's
go ahead and get right into it
reason number one the iPhone 5s with its
anodized aluminum body chamfered edges
and sapphire crystal home button has
what most people would consider to be a
much more premium look and feel to it
than the more plastic a galaxy s5 - in
addition to the build quality the iPhone
5s is also smaller thinner and lighter
than the galaxy s5 making it a bit more
pocketable and easier to hold in the
hand 3 while this advantage is becoming
less and less of a selling point for iOS
in general the fact still remains that
right now the App Store and the iPhone
still has a better selection of apps
with more iOS first and iOS exclusive
apps available than the Play Store on
the galaxy s5 for speaking of apps like
you'd expect on the galaxy s5 you can't
get any of Apple's apps like Siri
iMessage or FaceTime but on the iPhone
not only do you have apple's apps but
you also get to have googles as well
with apps like Google now hangouts and
more all available for free on the App
Store so you kind of get the best of
both worlds
reason number 5 but one thing you don't
get on the iPhone 5s is the annoying and
uninstalling pre-loaded carrier apps
that plagued some of the carrier
versions of the galaxy s5 6 under the
privacy settings of the iPhone you can
see what an app has access to on your
phone and if you don't feel comfortable
with something in app can access you can
just switch it off without having to
delete the app completely like you would
on the galaxy
five seven on the iPhone 5s you can tap
the notification bar while on any screen
to automatically scroll to the top of
whatever you're looking at which can be
really convenient when the lists get
long eight with guided access you can
lock the iPhone 5s to any app that you
want so you can hand your phone to your
kid or even a friend without having to
worry about them getting into anything
else 9 while both the iPhone 5s and the
galaxy s5 have fingerprint scanners the
one on the iPhone is much more
convenient to use as you don't have to
swipe your finger across it making doing
things like unlocking your phone a lot
quicker reason number 10 because the
iPhone 5s gets us a base tray from Apple
you'll be updated to the latest version
of iOS just about right after Apple
releases it whereas on the galaxy s5 it
can take anywhere from a few weeks to
several months before you get an update
after it's been released eleven on the
iPhone 5s you can raise the phone to
your ear to use Siri through the
earpiece so that way you can do voice
searches in public without disturbing
anyone or letting anybody know what
you're searching 12
unlike the Galaxy s5 when you connect a
Bluetooth accessory to the iPhone 5s you
get an icon in the notification bar
indicating the battery life of the
connected accessory 13 the Lightning
port on the iPhone 5s is reversible so
you can plug it in to charge in either
direction making plugging it in at night
when the lights are off so much easier
on the iPhone than it is on the galaxy
s5 and it's protective flap 14 when you
want to send a large video file via
email on the galaxy s5 you're met with
this error message with no suggestive
solution whereas on the iPhone 5s
sending the same video file results in
the iPhone automatically compressing the
video for you and sending it seamlessly
reason number 15 historically speaking
iPhones have had better resale values
than galaxy s's meaning in a year or two
from now there's a good chance that
you'll get more cash back for the iPhone
5s than you would for the galaxy s5 16
because the iPhone 5s has flat edges all
the way around you can sit perfectly on
just about any flat surface which can be
useful for situations like when you want
to watch a YouTube video without having
to hold the phone or if you want to take
an automatic 360 panorama with apps like
twister 17 from pretty much anywhere you
can copy and paste on the iPhone 5s you
have
option to have selected text read back
to you out loud ideal for long articles
or when you don't have time to look away
from what you're currently doing 18
while the Galaxy s5 has the advantage of
being compatible with Samsung's own
Galaxy gear
generally speaking the iPhone 5s is
compatible with more devices and
accessories with them oftentimes being
made to work specifically with the
iPhone 19 the dedicated vibrate switch
on the iPhone 5s lets you conveniently
silence the phone without having to turn
the screen on the switch also acts as a
visual indicator so you can tell if the
phone is silenced or not with a quick
glance which can help you avoid those
embarrassing moments when your phone
rings when you don't want it to reason
number 20 as we saw in the phone book
style speed test we conducted the iPhone
5s with its dual-core a7 chip
outperforms the galaxy s5 giving you a
smoother and more responsive experience
overall 21 on the back of the iPhone 5s
you'll find two LED lights that together
give you better and more natural-looking
light when taking photos than the single
LED found on the back of the galaxy s5
22 speaking of taking photos the iPhone
5s is birdshot is faster and lasts for
much longer than the Galaxy s5s all but
guaranteeing you that you'll be able to
capture that Kodak moment 23 but
sometimes those Kodak moments are better
off being captured in slow motion
instead of just a picture end with the
iPhone 5s not only do you get 720p slow
motion video but you also get audio to
go along with that video making reliving
those moments even more epic 24 the
iPhone 5s has three microphones compared
to the Galaxy s5s 2 which results in
better quality sound and videos and also
offers better voice quality for the
people on the other end of your phone
calls reason number 25 on the topic of
sound quality the iPhone 5s is bottom
facing speaker offers both louder and
better quality sound than the single
rear speaker found on the galaxy s5 ok
so there you have it those are my top 25
reasons why the iPhone 5s could be
considered better than the galaxy s5 if
you want to hear the 25 reasons that I
have for the galaxy s5 watch the s5
version of this video which will be
annotated somewhere here in the screen
