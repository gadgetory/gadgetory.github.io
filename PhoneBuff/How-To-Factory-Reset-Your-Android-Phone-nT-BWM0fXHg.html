Wambach calm and today I'm gonna show
you one the most basic troubleshoots you
could do on your Android phone and
that's a hard reset or a factory reset
basically what this does is it wipes out
everything on your phone and revert it
back to the factory defaults like the
way it was the day you first got your
phone this helps ensure any software
problems you might be having are
resolved and also help determine whether
or not the issues you're having our
hardware or software related with that
said I'll go ahead and show you how to
do it you're going to press Menu from
your home screen you're going to hop
into settings and from this list you're
going to look for something along lines
of privacy or phone and storage every
phone is a little bit different so you
might have to look around but in this
case it's under privacy for this phone
you see at the very top it says factory
data reset
here's might say something different but
it's pretty much you know along those
lines so I'll go ahead and tap this guy
and you can see you have the option to
format my USB storage because this phone
does have an internal memory I can
format this but this erases all my music
my photos and other media files so I'm
going to skip that and for the most part
if you're trying to fix problem you can
too but if you want to wipe your phone
out completely pictures and all just hit
check that guy and your phone will be
completely wiped but in this case I'm
just going to hit reset phone and it
warns me says it will delete all
personal information and downloaded
applications basically like they was
when you first got it so I'm going to go
ahead and hit erase everything and you
see it's going through its little boot
it'll restart your phone takes a couple
of minutes depending on your device and
it'll load back up and you'd have to LA
tree login to your Gmail account to get
your contacts back if you have synced
them with Gmail but that's pretty much
it this is Dave in phonebook calm
