iPhone 7 Apple decided to kill the
headphone jack meaning those fancy
headphones you've got yeah they're not
gonna work with the new iPhone unless
you carry around an adapter now this
move has obviously upset a lot of people
there's a bunch of people ranting on
social media
there's memes there's conspiracy
theories and in general it seems like
people just can't understand why Apple
would do such a thing
so in today's video we're gonna look at
all the information we have and as
fairly as we can we're gonna try to
determine the real reason why Apple
decided to remove the headphone jack but
before we do I want to give a big
shout-out to Braintree payments for
sponsoring today's video so developing
your own mobile app can be complex but
integrating your payment option no
longer has to be with Braintree your
business can accept nearly every type of
payment from any device with just one
integration everything from pesos to
PayPal to Android pay and whatever new
payment option comes next
Braintree is simple flexible SDKs make
your job and your payments easier learn

bomba all right let's get right into it
so during the iPhone 7s press event VP
of Marketing Phil Schiller went on stage
and positioned the audio jack as this
old technology that's been around since
the late 1800s now this is a smart move
by Apple by angling in this way as
generally speaking we all know that
newer technology is better than old
technology and the reminder just how old
the audio jack really is kind of primed
us to be a little bit more accepting to
what they had to say next but a
technology being old in and of itself
isn't a reason enough to kill it so
Apple went on to give us there are three
reasons why they decided to remove the
headphone jack well go ahead and take a
look at each one one by one to see how
each reason stands up on its own let's
hear the first one so first we've shown
that we can use lightning for our inbox
headphones and to adapt also they loathe
all the older devices through analog
interfaces and it is a great connector
for doing that and there's a very large
base of users who can all take advantage
of it
so apple's first reason to killing the
headphone jack is that they've shown
that headphones can be used
lightning like the ones that they've
included in the box and that they have
an adapter that lets you still use your
older analog headphones as a supporting
reason this might work but on its own
it's not a real reason having an
alternative that isn't any better than
the current option doesn't warrant a
change and lightning headphones aren't
better the sound quality will be roughly
the same as they are with analog
headphones and this alternative comes
with a problem of not being able to
charge your phone and listen to music at
the same time as well as the
inconvenience of having to carry around
an adapter for older headphones so I'm
going to throw out reason number one but
let's hear reason number two our
smartphones are packed with technologies
and we all want more we want bigger just
bright er displays we want larger
batteries we want faster processors we
want stereo speakers we want optic
engines we want all of that and it's all
fighting for space within that same
enclosure and maintaining an ancient
single purpose analog big connector
doesn't make sense because that space is
at a premium
okay so Apple's second reason for
killing the headphone jack is that the
headphone jack takes up a lot of that
precious internal space that can be
otherwise used for other tech this
sounds a little bit more legit in fact I
did some digging and found that in an
interview with BuzzFeed an Apple
executive explained this second reason
in more detail he said that historically
at the top of I phones they had a small
circuit board called a driver ledge that
drives the iPhones display and backlight
but on the iPhone 7 this driver ledge
interfered with the new larger camera
systems I'm imagining that this was more
to a problem with the 7 plus with this
dual camera system taking up twice the
space so the Apple engineers tried
moving the driver ledge lower on the
phone which then interfered with other
components like the headphone jack so
according to Apple they tried removing
the headphone jack altogether and what
they found was by not having the
headphone jack it made it easier to
install the new taptic engine and there
was also space for a 14% larger battery
on the iPhone 7 and a 5% larger battery
on the iPhone 7 plus and to top it off
they said that removing the headphone
jack helped the iPhone 7 obtain the IP
67 water and dust rating that Apple's
seriously needed to compete with
Amazon so yeah this seems like a real
reason I mean obviously there's going to
be differences in opinion as to whether
or not trading the headphone jack for a
larger battery the new taptic engine and
a dual lens camera system was worth it I
know that they said it helped also make
the phone water-resistant but the galaxy
s7 is water-resistant and it still has a
headphone jack so I'm not buying that
part but as for the other features I'll
take Apple's word for it but let's move
on and hear Apple's third reason and
third and I think this is most important
of all when you have a vision of how
audio the audio experience can be you
want to get there as fast as you can and
make it as great as it can be and we do
have a vision for how audio should work
on mobile devices and that takes us to
our next feature wireless
okay so Apple's third reason to killing
the headphone jack is that Apple
believes Wireless is the future in fact
there have been reports supporting this
showing that sales of Bluetooth
headphones outnumber the sales of Wired
headphones but again while this may work
as a supporting reason by itself it
isn't enough to be considered a real
reason I mean what does the future being
Wireless have to do with removing the
headphone jack the galaxy s7 can be
charged wirelessly but you don't see
Samsung removing the charging port so
while I agree that Wireless is the
future then I have to throw out reason
number three but let's keep listening to
see where they were going with this
vision of a wireless future so that is
why today we are so excited to show you
a new product from Apple called Apple
earpods
Oh a pair of 160 dollar ear pods
how convenient especially when you take
into consideration that in that same
BuzzFeed interview were talking about
earlier an Apple exec said that the air
pod project was started at the same time
as the Apple watch project I'm not sure
if he was talking about the first Apple
watch or the second but if he was
talking about the first one which it
kind of sounds like he was why didn't
the air pods come out sooner it's not
like the air pods only work with the
iPhone 7 as according to Apple's own
website they're compatible with older
headphone jack equipped iPhones so I
find it a little convenient that Apple
waited to launch the new air pods
alongside an iPhone that happens not to
have a
Bojack kinda nudging consumers to buy it
just as this convenient that Apple also
happens their own beads which is the
only other headphone brand that
currently benefits and will likely ever
benefit from Apple's new w1 chip that
powers the amazing tech inside the air
pods I also find it convenient that
Apple can now charge other headphone
brands and MFI certification fee in
order for them to make wired headphones
that will work with the iPhone that's a
huge market of people and it'll
definitely cut in to third party
headphone makers profit margins while
simultaneously giving beats even more
money for celebrity endorsements now
there's technically nothing wrong with
any of this it's just good business
in fact it's great business Apple didn't
spend 3 billion dollars on beats for
nothing but when you ask why Apple
killed the headphone jack out of the
three reasons that Apple gave us the
only one that makes any real sense is
freeing up internal space and then
there's that unstated business reason
why Apple may have killed the headphone
jack so which one is the real reason
honestly I think it's a little bit of
both with freeing up the internal space
probably being the bigger one as a lot
of the iPhone sevens key new features
supposedly depended on removing the jack
but let me know what you guys think down
below in the comments can you live
without the headphone jack or the new
features worth it to you or are you done
with Apple and switching to Samsung I'd
love to hear you guys think but anyways
that is it for me in this video thank
you guys for watching in as always I'll
see you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
