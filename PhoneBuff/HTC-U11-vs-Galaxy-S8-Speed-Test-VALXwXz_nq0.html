months back we did a speed test with the
HTC u ultra and pretty much like the
rest of that phone the results weren't
all that impressive but luckily
thankfully the u otro wasn't HTC's true
flagship smartphone I mean they were
acting like it was so it's not heard
sales so somehow the price and spec
sheet weren't going to do that already
but today we have HTC's real flagship in
the u 11 we have the standard 40
gigabyte model here today going up
against the standard Galaxy s8 Plus
which given how close these two are in
terms of specs it'll really show us the
optimization that each of these
manufacturers has put into their
smartphones but before we get into it I

that said let's get to the speed test
all right you know the drill we'll kick
things off by starting with stopwatches
on each phone and then jump right into
the first row of system ads both Onslow
the cameras at about the same rate but
the s8 does give the lead over the you
11 in the Photos app however the you 11
doesn't look complacent with a cutting
down on that lead loading both settings
and Facebook at a faster rate putting it
just a half step behind the s8 as both
balls work on Photoshop mix so the s8
finishes Photoshop at a faster rate with
both Walltown moving on to lapses now in
theory the 11 should be able to make a
comeback here with its higher 2.45
gigahertz clock speed and yeah the U 11
just blows through laughs it's easily
passing the s8 and it's 2.3 5 gigahertz
clock speeds with you 11 looking to
build on its lead here in subway surfers
and yeah once again it loads the app up
at a faster rate finally creating just a
little bit of separation between the two
but the s8 still has plenty of time to
make a comeback with six more apps left
here in the first lap that's I mentioned
that we have the entire second lap left
to go but so far things aren't looking
so hot for Samsung's flagship with it
falling even further behind as the U 11
loads both flip diving and fits a phat
at a faster rate so as we head into
bullet force we'll see if the s8 can at
least load one of the four games faster
than the U 11 which would definitely
help it cut down on its lead and give
the SI a real shot at making a comeback
but no the opposite happens with the U
11 not only loading the game faster but
doing so decisively with increasing
ously so the largest one we've seen yet
in the speed test with the U 11 pulling
a full lap ahead as both phones start
working on the last row so at this point
the SI it's only real hope lies in the
second lap which isn't the most
promising given samsung's track record
but the U 11 hasn't proven itself yet as
it finishes the first lap at the time of
one minute and 37 seconds with the s8
coming in 6 seconds later at a time of 1
minute and 43 so so far so good for the
U 11 with it keeping all the apps
including bullet force and fit to fat
open but it fails to keep flip diving
ready to go but lucky for its the Galaxy
s8 stumbles on bullet force so despite
failing to keep all the apps open the U
11 is able to pull significantly ahead
of the s8 here in the second lap now
something I wanted to point out to you
guys is that you should only compare the
results and the speed test to the phones
that were put through the same exact
speed test sometimes we use different
apps in different speed tests due to
things like an app not working properly
on a new phone or we change things up to
make the track more intensive like when
we're testing phones with six or eight
gigabytes RAM the point here is it's not
about the last time or the total number
of apps at home to keep open it's about
how much faster that last time is and
how many more apps a phone can keep open
relative to the phone that is being
directly compared to which in this case
the HTC u 11 just outclassed the Galaxy
s8 finishing the entire test with a time
of 2 minutes and 30 seconds what does
having to fast forward the Galaxy s8
suit the finish line where it completed
the test there before seconds later with
the time of 3 minutes and 4 seconds
making the winner
the HTC you
here's a look at the individual app load
of times from the first flat where you
can see just where the u11 beat out the
Galaxy s8 but after that that is it for
me in this video thank you guys for
watching and as always I'll see you in
the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
