and today is a day the Apple announced
its next-generation iphone namely the
iphone 5 so it's not going to be called
you know the new iphone kind of a new
ipad was but nonetheless the iphone 5 is
here it's made entirely of glass and
aluminum on its exterior its twenty
percent lighter and eighteen percent
thinner than the iphone 4s weighing in
at just 112 grams and it's seven point
six millimeters thick so it's gonna be a
lot easier to hold in the hand and
that's a good thing considering that the
iphone 5s gonna be a little bit taller
due to the fact that for the first time
you know since the iphone came out in
2007 Apple is bumping up the screen
sense from 3.5 inches to 4 inches at a
resolution of 1136 x 640 so a little bit
higher resolution than the 4s however
the ppi considering it is a bigger
screen is about the same at 326 PPI to
reason why Apple is doing this one
people wanted it you know a lot of
people wanted a bigger screen especially
considering the competition on Android
and Windows Phone have bigger screens
and two it brings you closer to that 16
by 9 aspect ratio which makes watching
movies and videos on YouTube a lot more
enjoyable on the iphone 5 screen now of
course the new iPhones be running the
newest version of the iOS which is iOS 6
by the way iOS 6 to be released for
other I devices starting stember 19th
but anyway um daya 45 is going to have
optimized apps for its larger display so
apps like the calendar for example are
going to be able to show you more
information at once compared to the
iphone 4s other apps that are gets
updated for the large display will kind
of display in a letter box mode kind of
like the ipad you know when you download
an iphone app has a black borders around
it it'll look like that of course not
that big of a difference because the
resolution difference isn't all that big
but shouldn't take that one for
developers to update that anyways the
next thing i want to talk about is the
processors this something i'm actually
excited by it kind of surprised me
everything else I was kind of expecting
so the processor on this guy is not the
85 X kind of like a lot without
considering that the new iPad had that
and you know in the past the iphone
pretty much followed the iPad as far as
the processor but this time around Apple
announced the a6 processor which it says
two times the cpu performance and two
times the graphics performance
comparison to a five not sure if to talk
about the a 5x with a five but I assumes
the a5 because everything else has been
compared to the iphone 4s before that's
can be inside you know it's going to
give you a lot more performance course
can't wait to put that to the test but
going on the cameras can be the same
type of a megapixel camera that we saw
before of course this time is going to
give you forty percent faster image
capture school it was pretty much
instead performed ivan for us could be
even faster than that now you're going
to get better low-light performance
you're going to have panorama mode for
the first time you know finally on the
iphone which you can take the picture
towards on tlie and pretty much this
like drag our sweep your phone across
and once it's done attaching all the
pictures together it pretty much is the
equivalent of a twenty eight megapixel
picture the 1080p video is going to be a
lot better with the optical image
stabilization or improved image
stabilization or say it rates the word
optical or know why I said it cuz I the
lumiose my head it has been is gonna
have improved image stabilization which
should be nice the front facing camera
is going to be 720 p which is pretty
awesome and what makes it even more
awesome is for the first time also base
time is going to be activated over
cellular I'm not sure you know how it's
gonna work i'm guessing maybe only over
4g LTE but it depends on your carrier
might otherwise gonna be coming out for
sprint verizon ATT and the US kind of
like the iphone 4s other things note
that the iphone 5 has three microphones
one atop one at the bottom one in the
back which helps with voice recognition
and noise cancellation ask the batter
type they say you know it's going to be
better than the iphone 4s which is
something that we definitely want giving
you 8 hours of talktime on 3g you're
going to get eight hours of browsing on
3g or 4g LTE and 10 hours of browsing
with Wi-Fi which is pretty nice
something that's new also this iphone 5
is the connector so you're not gonna get
that traditional you know ipod iphone
connected that we've had you know for a
couple of years now it's going to be an
8-pin charger that you connect you
connecting either way so you can put it
you know up side up or upside down and
actually detected so it's going to be
pretty cool i mean that's gonna be a lot
easier than plugging in normally you
know at night time for you
in bed laying down try to plug it in
before you go to sleep and I mentioned
that because you know other phones have
wireless charging this is kind of a way
that you know the iphone 5 can compete
with that so it doesn't have water the
charging by the way no mentions of NFC
by Apple as far as the connector the
Apple did say that I can have a little
adapter so obviously all you have a
whole bunch of you know car chargers and
home chargers that you may not want to
upgrade buy new ones you just buy an
adapter and it'll connect you know to
your old pin and then go into the iphone
5 which is nice speaking of accessories
the headphones that will be changed now
they're actually called earpods now
which basically just gonna give you a
better audio experience it goes more
into your ear canal and you know you can
hear the music better which is nice
color options that are available on the
iPhone 5 is black and white pretty much
has been since you know the since always
um the white it's gonna have a you know
it's gonna be white on the front it's
gonna have an aluminum back kind of like
the original iphone and the black one is
gonna be bug on the front of course and
it's gonna have a black anodized backing
which is really nice and I'm really
excited to that I monastic right and get
the black one I don't know about you
guys but that won't look really nice in
the pictures alright so that's pretty
much it on the iphone 5 let's talk about
when you can actually get your hands on
it well Peter start on September 14th
and the device actually starts shipping
out you know in most countries including
the US starting on September 21st
pricing is going to be 200 or for the 16
gigabyte model 300 orders for the 32
gigabyte model and for inner doors for
the 64 gigabyte model so pretty much the
same pricing that we saw on the iphone
4s last year of course the iphone 4s
going to drop down one hundred dollars
up and the iphone 4 is going to drop
down to three pretty much the same
strategy we've seen apple you know do
for the last couple of years of course
all this with a two-year agreement with
your carrier but that's pretty much it
for me in this video let me know what
you guys think you know are you guys
excited about the iphone 5 are you guys
disappointed by the news we expecting
something more let me know in the
comments below and thank you for
watching the video if you haven't
subscribed yet please do so because i'll
be comparing the iphone 5 as soon as i
get my hands on it to you know the
iphone 4s of course some of the other
high end devices out there like the
samsung galaxy s3 and the Nokia Lumia
920 one that drops all right the several
minutes video thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
