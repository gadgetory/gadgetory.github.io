the galaxy s 8 plus that I think we all
wanted to see it's not your typical
galaxy s 8 plus you can't go to your
local store to buy it you can't even go
to Samsung's website to buy it because
it's only available in select countries
like Korea and if you're thinking about
importing this thing it's expensive
now luckily our sponsor a graphic stock
cover the cost of this device allowing
us to bring you this P test so big
things to them so in the spirit of
graphic Sox creator to creator
initiative let's take a look at
especially that I made using my graphic
stocks subscription so here the specs on
your normal Galaxy s8 which are
definitely nothing to scoff at but on
this special galaxy si plus Samsung
ticket to the next level
bumping the RAM up to six gigabytes and
doubling the internal storage up to 128
gigabytes so I'm excited for this speed
test now if you guys liked what you saw
in that spreadsheet with the awesome
graphics and vectors that I used
check out graphics card they're offering
a free 7-day trial at the link below
where you get unlimited access to
350,000 plus
graphics photos vectors and more
graphics talk is a great tool for anyone
interested in DIY graphic design arts or
any kind of other project I've been
using them for years so check them out
create something special and share it
with hashtag creator to creator all
right let's see if those the beautifully
presented specs actually translate into
better real-world performance let's get
right into it alright so on your left
you have the Galaxy S II Plus with 6
gigabytes of RAM and on your right is
your average Galaxy s8 with for both
phones here being powered by the same
Exynos 88-90 5 and both phones are using
the faster ufs 2.1 storage so I don't
really expect there to be much of a
difference here in the first lap the
only thing that may play a role is the
higher 128 gigabyte storage that comes
with a 6-ski by model which in theory
should have slightly faster read and
write speeds but then again I don't know
if it's going to make much of a
difference here as the faster read and
write speeds may only be noticeable
during larger file transfers so really
what I'm interested in is that what
happened
here in the first lab but what happens
in the second lab where the RAM
management on both of these phones will
be put to the test and if you've seen
any of our speed tests whether it was
with a galaxy s7 or with the Galaxy S
Deeds
you know that Samsung phones aren't the
best when it comes to keeping apps open
and ready to go in the background time
and time again we've seen
similarly expect Android phones with the
same four gigabytes of RAM do a better
job at keeping apps open so what I want
to see is if the additional two
gigabytes or 50% of extra ram is enough
to solve Samsung's relatively weak Ram
management so we'll go ahead and fast
forward to the second map which is what
we've all been waiting to see anyways
we're like I suspected the phone finish
only two seconds apart so below the
three second margin of error making that
first slap pretty much a tie okay so
this is where things will get
interesting well the six gigabytes of
RAM be enough for the s8 plus to keep
all the apps open so far so good but the
big test here is subway surfers and yes
the six gigabyte packin si+ keeps the
game open as it does lab sit Photoshop
snapchat and Facebook allowing it to run
away with the lead as the flooring
gigabytes of RAM on the regular essay
just wasn't enough to keep all the apps
open and how to reload both subway
servers and the Photoshop app here
allowing the beefed-up si+ to finish
first with a total time of two minutes
and 10 seconds while the regular s8 with
its or gigabits ram just looks
inadequate in comparison with it having
to reload most of the remaining apps
pushing it even further behind with it
finally completing the second map with a
total time of 2 minutes and 31 seconds
making the 6 gigabytes sh+ possibly the
fastest android smartphone in the world
anyways that is it for me in this video
thank you guys for watching and as
always I'll see you in the very next
episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
