in this video I'm doing a review on HD
widgets lotta you guys been asking me
about it in my video so I figured I
might as well do a full-on review on it
so as you can see I have my weather
widget right here I also have a switch
widget from HD widgets that lets me
toggle my wireless controls on and off
so before I go into the details as far
as how the widgets work I'm going to
show you what widgets are what sizes you
could add with a few widgets so you do
either switches or whether for a one by
one you could do a two by one for
whether for with one for switches and
whether for by two for the weather and
uh switches and then there's a four by
four if you want to take up the full
screen so anyway this is a four by two
as you can see these four icons across
two icons up and if you tap on any of
these areas which are customizable so
for example when I tap on this guy it
goes to my Google Calendar but if you
have a different calendar app on your
phone you can actually customize that
button to go to the app that you want
same thing goes with the weather but in
this case I just like using uh the HD
widgets weather UI because I just feel
like it looks super super nice as you
can see I have multiple cities on here
you can change your weather provider
from weather book idea whether google
weather and weather on the ground so
we'll just go ahead and use a google
weather as you can see the forecast
actually changes Google what they're
only gives you four days for some reason
so I just stick with weather bug anyway
you could add more places by hitting
that guy and you know adding more cities
and if you go to settings you can see
you have all these different options is
ICS theme so you're gonna have a you
know nice clean interface and you could
edit the widget hotspots like I was
talking about earlier right here so for
example if I wanted my my calendar to us
which does take kind of long for it to
load up but anyway if I wanted to switch
my calendar app I could choose you know
what app I wanted it to use obviously
that's the only calendar app I have so
I'm gonna cancel but you get the idea
there now I'll go ahead and show you
some of the other things so let me show
you that you can change like the date
format the time format anyways let's go
and show you the widget itself now so as
you can see this is my weather widget
right now I'm gonna go ahead and add
another one though so I'll go right here
and now
add a similar one I'll do a 4x2 again
drop it right here and what's really
cool is you see this background it shows
my wallpaper so I can see what this
widget will look like and it's very
customizable so I could choose whether I
want the header in the center if I want
it over to the left like I have on my
home screen but when it to the right so
say for example I went to the right I
can actually choose the background so
you see right here I'm on the background
tab let's say I make the background red
and let's do the clock now and you can
see I could choose all these different
types of clocks I'll choose this guy I
actually know what the one that was on
looked better
so we'll just choose that because it
looks pretty good we could actually
choose the background so I can choose if
I wanted to be like that with the four
little separated tabs I could do just
two little tab like that I mean really
lets you customize exactly how you want
it I can just take it off completely
looks kind of weird without it so I'll
just leave will do this guy anyway you
go to the clock color so I can change
the color of the font itself so let's
say I wanted to make it blue to match my
background and there you go that's
pretty cool and you can even go to the
font and change it so right now it's
like on a bold font I can make it you
know skinnier I can make it a look like
this I mean you get the idea so anyway
that's how you can customize your edges
you can do for any of the widgets
there's a few other types of words
because you do you don't have to do a
weather and clock you can just do a
clock alone and again you have the same
custom Ã¶zil features you can do clock
and date you could do just weather
you could do a three day forecast or you
can do a 5 day forecast so definitely
cool another cool feature right here is
the random button say you didn't you
just want to do a random one it'll
choose a random
customization for you but obviously
probably wouldn't use that but all that
often considering that you got this
widget to be able to customize it so
anyway I this is my switch widget so
I'll go ahead and add another switch
widget really quick so it's a four by
one I'll go ahead and add it to my home
screen so again you can switch it to be
a switch you can make it just the
forecast you could be a o'clock you
can't really see that right now boy
there's a clock right here and you could
decide you know where you want the clock
so same type of customization as we saw
with the other widget but we'll go back
go to the switches because the switches
wasn't available on the other one or the
other size so as you can see I can
switch the background so let's make the
background look like that kind of match
my background a little we'll go to the
switches now this is the coolest part
because you could choose a whole bunch
of different default ones that they come
with controls that you probably use so
if you wanted for example if you have a
4G phone you have the option for G off
Bluetooth brightness whatever and the
power saver if you cared about you know
you saving your battery life these are
all the ones that have to do with your
battery life so definitely cool but you
know the one I choose as you can see
this Davis switches because I customize
it myself so if you go over to switches
and tap on this little arrow right here
you could actually customize each one of
these so these are the ones I actually
use like tilt lock I love having that
feature on there by auto brightness etc
but let's say for example I didn't with
GPS and you know I don't really use that
all that much but I don't know what else
to put I could put my battery right here
so I could have my battery so if I hit
check now will go home to my icon so I
hasn't updated yet to delete this guy
and then re-add it so let me add it
really quick oh man just messed it up
anyway I'll actually no I didn't right
here battery so hit check there you go
so you see now I have my battery
percentage right there so that's
definitely a cool feature if I didn't
want to you know if I don't have a
battery percentage up in my notification
port but anyway this is a quick review
actually it's not quick almost six
minutes but anyway that's my review for
HD widgets I mean I really love this up
but definitely recommend it very clean
user interface really customizable I
mean just about everything is
customizable though developers done a
really nice job with it and like I said
as ICS theme setting so it's nice and
clean interface but anyway that's it for
me in this video hopefully this helps
