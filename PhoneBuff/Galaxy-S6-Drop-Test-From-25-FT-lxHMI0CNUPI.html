we're gonna be taking a look at the
Rhino shield crashguard which is a
bumper case for the galaxy s6 but what
makes this case special at least
according to evolutive labs the company
behind the case is what they call egg
drop technology which is set to absorb
impact of at least not up to put at
least eleven and a half B what we're
looking at here is the bundle that
includes both front and back screen
protectors in addition to the bumper
which is actually available in a number
of different colors and is also
available for the iPhone 6 so if you
guys are interested I'll be putting any
links I find down below in the
description
now if you guys can remember last time
we did the fumble style drop test in the
galaxy s6 it didn't bear too well with
the glass cracking on both the front and
the back when we first dropped it onto
tile and the phone completely given out
when we dropped it onto concrete so in
this video made possible by evolutive
labs for providing both the case and the
galaxy s6 a test with we're gonna be
putting the s6 through the same exact
foam bo style drop test but this time
with the protection of the Rhino shield
crashguard to see just how much impact
protection this case can actually offer
let's go ahead and get right into it
alright so on your left you have a
galaxy s6 being tested without a case
and on your right you have a galaxy s6
with the Rhino shield crashguard well
start off by dropping the phones on
their backs onto a hard tile surface
from about 3 feet up
and as you can see the s6 without a case
has its glass cracked on the back while
the Rhino shield protected s6 shows no
signs of damage whatsoever next drop is
the side drop onto tile this time the s6
is a little bit of scuffing along the
bottom but nothing too bad while again
the case protected s6 remains flawless
all right now it's time to drop both
phones face-first onto tile and the s6
without a case not only has its outer
glass badly cracked but the actual
display underneath the glass is cracked
as well so pretty significant damage
while on the other hand the s6 with the
Rhino shield still looks in perfect
condition alright so like I said earlier
this first drop onto concrete is where
the naked s6 gives out so this is really
the moment of truth for the Rhino shield
crashguard
and again nothing absolutely no damage
to the s6 with the Rhino shield while
the naked Essex gave out completely with
shattered glass on the back and the
display just totally Wiggin out on the
front with the naked s6 failing the test
will only be testing the rhino shield
from here on out so the next drop is the
side drop onto concrete and the phone
still remains undamaged only thing that
really happened here was a few small
scuffs along the bottom of the case
itself alright final drop in this fumble
style drop test is face-first onto
concrete
and the s6 still works
no visible damage to the phone itself
only a few scuff marks to the case on
the top right and along the side all
right so we could have ended this drop
test right here as the Rana shield has
already proven that it can protect the
essays from everyday drops but the guys
over at evolutive labs actually wanted
us to go beyond the phone book style
drop test and take things to the extreme
so we decided to do not one but two
consecutive drops onto concrete from
just over six feet high and the result
was the same the s6 works flawlessly
with only a few more scuffs to the
bottom of the case itself all right now
it's time to put that 11 and a half foot
claim to the test
dropping the s6 from just over 12 feet
and the case lives up to its promise
with the Essex still working no damage
to the glass or the display on the front
and the back looking pretty much in
perfect condition alright so I was so
impressed with the case that I just had
to take things to the next level just to
see what it can do for that tent so here
we're dropping the Essex from about 24
feet up this is crazy and we weren't
able to get the screen to actually turn
on the glass on the outside doesn't look
like it's shattered or any kind of
noticeable damage but like I said
nothing comes up on the screen when you
press the home button or the power
button so after ten consecutive drops
with each drop getting harder and harder
the Galaxy S six finally gave out it's
actually the inner display that's not
working the outer glass is perfectly
intact and the device technically turns
on I here do the jingle when I power
cycle it but obviously nothing shows up
on the front outside of the capacitive
touch buttons taking a look underneath
the case the edges of the phone look
pretty much in perfect condition the
back shows no sign of visible damage and
looks brand-new when you take off the
protective layer and the front looks
virtually undamaged until you hold it up
at a certain angle where you can see the
inner display cracked underneath the
glass so overall I have to say I'm
pretty impressed with the case while I
was kind of expecting it to pass the
bumblestop portion of the test I didn't
actually think of survived as many drops
as it actually did especially that
12-foot drop which if you think about it
is kind of crazy considering what the
phone had been through before that point
and the fact that this is just a bumper
case it's not one of those heavy-duty
and often bulky cases that hide the
design of the phone it's a lightweight
alternative and it gives it a similar
level of protection so I don't know I
gotta say yes it's pretty damn
impressive obviously there is a breaking
point and frost out the tenth drop from
about 25 feet so as long as you don't
something crazy like that you should
probably be okay but anyways that is
pretty much it for me in this video
thank you guys for watching him as
always I'll see you in the very next
