is just around the corner so if you
haven't bought your christmas gifts yet
odds are you're not gonna be able to get
them in time if you show them online so
today we're going to bestbuy seeing if
we can get five cool tech gifts with a
total budget of 100 bucks let's go ahead
and get right into it
a dobrze price range here you go it's
actually pretty cool bluetooth speaker
last up to four hours causes twenty
bucks alright so we're we got some cases
iphone 5c case that looks like a crock
twenty bucks yeah I'd rather get that
bluetooth speaker oh that's who it's 40
bucks I don't know if you get one of
these as a gift though what does that
mean I can I go you kind of insulting
some right no but it's like hey here's a
toothbrush use it yeah it's gonna be
harder than I thought was gonna be what
is that all is envoys from can see like
boys report is a hundred bucks phone has
one built in all right i'm gonna start
picking some stuff up for sure i'm gonna
do chromecast it's 30 bucks takes thirty
percent of the budget but definitely an
awesome good what does it do it stands
there you know you like that nothing
here you think a good parts cheating you
just being lazy lazy yeah get carter for
lazy people i give you a part of all the
time though so Oh prayer insignia 20
bucks for the 200 milliamps
twenty bucks i'm going with it so 70 $18
is locked up it must be good Finn for a
kid what does it do though does it it
has to be like a type a guy has to like
turn on right I only have five bucks oh
my have five bucks yeah I know it won't
work what if this portable power five
bucks this is 20 bucks we got more
budget see that word right there that's
perfect yeah so 30 20 50 55 a 20 bucks
for some I home
Star Wars branded headphones probably
not the best headphones in the world but
its star wars and I even the listen to
musics gonna put it on and walk around
alright I'm going with that so one two
three four so now we have 25 bucks so
we're in good shape we're in good shape
how much is the drone again I want the
drone so what don't we have another like
another thing that we give that doesn't
fit into any of these categories
actually a home appliance this is for
like that somebody older a toaster maybe
you might as well get the hot dog how
much was that $25
I think so I think so all right
the wire all right so we're back in the
studio we were able to get five tech
gifts for under 100 bucks so we spent
ninety nine dollars and ninety six cents
we did cut it close but we got the job
done for twenty bucks we went with these
star wars-themed I home headphones no
idea what the sound card is gonna be
like on these things but if you have a
Star Wars fan in your life this may be a
viable option for thirty bucks we got
the trusty google chromecast the latest
edition probably the best gift to give
somebody who doesn't have a smart TV or
a chromecast already this thing's
freaking awesome and then five bucks
mainly because I needed some leeway in
my budget and head up going with this
portable charger here for up micro USB
phones it's 2,000 milliamps so not the
biggest capacity but it's five bucks so
you can't complain and then we actually
ended up going with this $20 jam
bluetooth wireless speaker I've actually
used one of these in the past and it
does produce decent sound so something I
would recommend for twenty bucks not a
bad deal but my favorite pic easily
easily one of my favorite picks out a
lot is this $25 pop up hot dog toaster
that's right you put your hot dog in
here put the buns in here and it may be
in less than a minute what does it say
place two hot dogs and two buns in and
enjoy perfect and delicious hot dogs
every time 25 bucks full review let me
know alright guys that is pretty much it
for me in this video you guys enjoyed it
make sure to give it a big thumbs up
thank you for watching and uh happy
holidays
hey hey dude we're gonna have to cut the
 out of this whatever</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
