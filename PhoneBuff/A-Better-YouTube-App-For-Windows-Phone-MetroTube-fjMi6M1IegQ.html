fumble calm and today we're doing a
quick video review of an app called
metro tube available on the windows
marketplace for your Windows Phone Metro
tube as the name says is basically a
YouTube application that uses that same
Metro UI that you're used to seeing
throughout your phone so on the first
screen you can see you've got your most
viewed and featured videos on YouTube
you can scroll over and you have your
categories and you can see get it sorted
by most viewed by featured top rated and
staff picks so it's a nice way to be
able to browse the YouTube site and
lastly you have my tube is what they're
calling it basically just gives you your
subscriptions your favorites playlist
uploads and your recently played videos
so we'll go ahead and watch a video just
to kind of show you the advantages um
what you'll see first is you can
actually play the video in portrait mode
like you can on Android and it gives you
more of a desktop experience as you can
see the comments and read them while
you're watching the video you can scroll
over to author and see the author's
other videos you get scroll over and see
related videos and go right back into
the video and you see the video never
stop playing so I'll show you how the
video are how the app looks in portrait
mode the thing that this has which the
stock YouTube app doesn't is you have
the ability to fast-forward rewind put
it into HD HQ or low quality right
within the video you could lock or our
auto rotation and you can make it take
up the full screen to fill up the 43
asset ratio instead of having it play in
the 16 by 9 aspect ratio the stock
YouTube app really doesn't let you do
any of this the only thing you do on
that is play the video and make it take
up the full screen so this app is
developed by a developer called
lazy worm and i really recommend it you
could buy it on the windows marketplace
or you could try it and if you do the
trial you have unlimited place so pretty
much it's free but if you want to
support the developer go ahead and buy
it and that's it this Dave bomble com
thank you for watching the video and
don't forget to visit for more calm for
more cell phone news reviews and how
to's thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
