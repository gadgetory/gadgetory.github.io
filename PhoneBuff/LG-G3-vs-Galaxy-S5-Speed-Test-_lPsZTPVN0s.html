in the description below to start your
free 7-day trial today what's up guys
david here from bomba and today i've got
an exciting speed test for you between
the all-new LG g3 and the samsung galaxy
s5
now what's interesting about this speed
test is while both phones have the same
processor the g3 we're testing has an
extra gigabyte of ram compared to the s5
which theoretically should help us
performance but at the same time the g3
also has a lot more pixels to push with
this quad HD display which theoretically
should hinder its performance so it's
tough to say which phone will actually
perform better when looking at the spec
sheet alone and that's exactly why we do
these fumble style speed tests racing
each phone through a virtual obstacle
course so we can actually see which one
is actually faster in the real world
let's go ahead and get right into it
alright so really quick I want to let
you guys know that both phones are
coming off a fresh reboot and both are
connected to the same Wi-Fi network well
begin by starting these stopwatches and
then jumping into the first obstacle if
you will in taking a picture going into
the gallery both phones are
neck-and-neck with the galaxy s5 having
only a split second advantage heading
into Temple Run 2 speaking of which
it'll be interesting to see how the g3
holds up in this gaming portion of this
test considering that it has so many
more pixels to push with that quad HD
display but so far the extra load on the
GPU doesn't seem to be holding you back
with it keeping up with the galaxy s5 no
problem moving on to the Angry Birds app
it looks like the g3 has actually
captured a lead with the s5 trailing it
by about a second or so the next step up
and this virtual obstacle course is
Google Earth where we're really putting
each of these phones GPUs to the test
loading up a 3d model of Paris in the
Eiffel Tower and so far it looks like
both phones are loading it up at the
same rate along the g3 to keep its split
second lead heading into the trim Pro so
in this app we're compressing the same
video file on each phone which is
probably the most processor intensive
task in this whole speed test and as you
can see the s5 is just flying through it
recapturing the lead it lost earlier in
moving
to the score mobile app as the g3
finishes compressing that video the
galaxy s5 seems to be struggling a bit
with the score mobile app so even though
we're getting pretty late into the game
the g3 still has a shot at pulling off a
last-second win if we can load up the
verge website faster and Chrome and so
far it looks like it's doing just that
with it narrowing the lead loading out
the mobile web site and going into the
full Versailles both phones are
neck-and-neck this is really anyone's
game but looks like the galaxy s5
finishes just a split second quicker
squeezing out the win in the first round
of the speed test but we're not done yet
we're gonna run the same obstacle course
again but this time in Reverse
seeing which phone can handle
multitasking better as you can see the
animations seem to be a little quicker
on the galaxy s5 but for the most part
the g3 is sticking with it and going
into Temple Run 2 the g3 is 3 gigabytes
of RAM coming to play
keeping temperament 2 running in the
background while the galaxy s5s ticking
whets of ram force the phone to have to
reopen the app giving the g3 a huge
advantage with it already finishing the
remaining apps in the second round and
the galaxy s5 just now getting into the
camera where it does seem to stutter a
bit but there you go the s5 is finally
done clearly giving the win in the
second round to the g3 ok while the
Galaxy s5 was a second or so faster than
the g3 in the initial test the g3 was a
good 10 seconds faster than the s5 when
we did the test in Reverse so overall I
have to give the win to the g3 but as
you guys saw both bones can definitely
hold their own
