Note 7 has some really high-end specs
with a powerful processor and a bunch of
RAM yep if you've seen our speed test
with it you know that it does leave a
little to be desired so in today's video
I'm gonna show you how to activate what
I like to call beast mode
to help you get better performance from
the note 7 without having to root the
phone let's go ahead and get right into
it
step number 1 remove blow air alright so
the first step to activating beast mode
or at least making the note 7 feel
faster is removing bloatware so what is
bloatware in the first place
basically they're the apps that will
Samsung and your carrier sometimes
preload onto your phone that you
personally did not install so for
example here on my 18 note 7 there's a
bunch of 80 apps I never use along with
some other apps like look out Yellow
Pages and s voice that I personally did
not install now some of these apps can
be running automatically in the
background using up system resources
which can definitely slow your phone
down
so to disable them open up the launcher
press and hold on their icons and then
drag the icon up to the uninstall or
disable option at the top then just
repeat the step for all the other blower
apps that you don't want step number 2
uninstall Ram hogs the next step is to
uninstall the apps you personally
installed but rarely ever use that could
be taken up more RAM than they're worth
so the first thing you're going to want
to do is identify which of your apps are
actually using up system resources in
the background to do this you'll first
have to unlock the hidden developer
options in these settings by hopping
into your main system settings tapping
on general management scrolling down to
where it says build number and then
tapping on it repeatedly until the phone
tells you you are now a developer once
you've done that hop back into the main
settings tap on the newly available
developer options at the bottom and then
from here tap on the running surfaces
option where you'll get a list of apps
that are currently using up ram now a
lot of these apps are system apps that
you need in order to run your phone or
their apps that you use often enough
survive them using a brown but sometimes
there are those few apps that you
install and kind of forget about that
end up using a ram even though you
rarely ever use them those are the apps
that we're looking for here so take note
of any apps you've installed but no
longer use that appear in this list and
then go back and uninstall them using
the same method we used earlier to
uninstall bloatware step number three
speed up animations the third step to
activating beastmode is already halfway
done for you now that you've unlocked
the developer options so hop back into
the settings tap on developer options
and then scroll down to the drawing
category where you'll see options for
window transition and animator scales
basically these are the animations and
transition effects that you see whenever
you open close our switch between apps
and by setting the animation scale to
0.5 X you can effectively cut the time
it takes to do these animations in half
or if you're like me and want the
snappiest experience possible you can
set all the animation scales to off
which will make opening and closing apps
feel much more instantaneous step number
four schedule automatic restarts alright
so the fourth step to activating
beastmode on the node seven is
scheduling automatic restarts once a
week to help you keep everything running
smooth if you've ever had performance
issues or even weird glitches on your
phone you know how much a simple restart
can help so why not schedule restarts
automatically as a preventative measure
to set this up hop into the main system
settings tap on cloud and accounts and
then backup and reset from here scroll
down to the auto restart option and tap
on it switch the toggle at the top to
the on position and then set the day and
time you want the phone to be
automatically restarted I'd personally
recommend a time that you know you'll be
asleep and at the beginning of each week
so you start the week with a fresh phone
step number five lower the resolution
okay so if you guys are a speed test
where we compare the node seven at its
full resolution to the node seven scale
down to 720p you know that lowering the
resolution doesn't necessarily make a
big difference in day-to-day use when it
comes to performance so this last step
to activating beast mode should only be
used in two situations the
versus when you want to save battery
life without affecting performance and
the second is when you're gaming and are
noticing that the game isn't running as
smoothly as you would like to lower the
note sevens resolution go to the main
system settings tap on device
maintenance hit battery and then select
the middle option on the pop-up tap the
customize button and if you're only
looking to scale down the resolution set
the maximum brightness limit to 100% and
change the resolution to either full HD
in the middle or regular HD to the left
for maximum benefit you want to make
sure that the limit device performance
option is toggled off and then hit apply
at the top this will lower the
resolution without affecting CPU
performance which again may help you in
intense 3d gaming situations or if you
just want to save some battery life
while maintaining optimal device
performance alright so there you have it
those are the five steps to activating
what I like to call beast mode on the
galaxy note 7 you can just use one of
the steps if you want or you can use all
of them it's completely up to you and
how you personally use your device but
with that said give this video a big
thumbs up if you found it helpful

videos just like this and as always I'll
see you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
