have been asking for it you've been
waiting for it and here it is today
we've got a speed test with the all-new
iPhone 7 where it'll go head-to-head
against the Galaxy Note 7 now if you
guys remember last time we saw the
Galaxy Note 7 and the speed test who's
getting embarrassed by the year-old
iPhone success but now it's time to see
what Apple's 2016 flagship can do again
Samsung's hottest new smartphone let's
get right into it
all right so we'll kick this thing off
by starting the stopwatch is on each
phone where the note 7 gets the step
over the iPhone 7 with is quicker
animations but heading into the gaming
row both phones are neck-and-neck where
the iPhone actually takes the lead
finishing asphalt 8 first and already
working on Angry Birds so as a note 7
tries to finish loading up asphalt 8 the
iPhone 7 finishes loading up Angry Birds
putting it a full lap ahead early on in
the speed test let's see if the iPhone 7
can add onto its lead here and no the
note 7 does a decent job at loading up
Angry Birds
keeping the iPhone 7 from pulling ahead
but unfortunately it doesn't do the same
for subway surfers with it struggling to
load the game up allowing the iPhone 7
to improve on its lead with it now being
a full two apps ahead as the galaxy note
7 finishes up with subway surfers the
iPhone 7 starts working on lapses where
each one will have to create a
time-lapse from the same exact video
file and the new a10 fusion ship just
plows through it's already finishing the
task and moving on to ESPN ok so at this
point the question isn't whether or not
the iPhone 7 will win the speed test
that's become pretty apparent by now
especially when you consider that the
older iPhone 6s already beat the note in
a previous speed test so what we're
really looking for here is to see by how
much the iPhone 7 will be the note with
it finishing the first stop at the time
of one minute and 14 seconds as the note
7 is still working on laps it so with
the iPhone 7 seeming to have all the
apps ready to go in the background in
this second lap
getting really close to lapping the note
seven which is still working on
processing that time-lapse so with
Photoshop makes being open the iPhone 7
officially laughs the note 7 as it
spreads to the finish line getting a
total time of 1 minute and 40 seconds so
with the note 7 taking its sweet time
here we'll go ahead and fast-forward it
where it finished that first stop a hold
24-second shot clock after the iPhone 7
and then perceives to not have a few of
the apps ready to go in the second lap
delaying its total time to a fold 3
minutes and 14 seconds making the winner
the iPhone 7 by a huge margin anyways
that is it for me in this video thank
you guys for watching and as always I'll
see you in a very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
