this video we're doing a review on the
Nexus 7 tablet from Google manufactured
by Asus as you guys can see the branding
here at the bottom I'm gonna do a quick
hardware towards device before I
actually get into the review so on the
front you have a IPS backlit display at
7 inches it's 1280 by 800 in resolution
at the top of the device you have a 1.2
megapixel front-facing camera on the
bottom we don't have capacitive touch
buttons obviously being a Nexus device
is going to be on screen like it wasn't
a Galaxy Nexus so you have back home and
the multitask button on the back of the
tablet you have no rear facing camera
but you do have this Nexus branding you
have this somewhat leathery material on
the back it's not leather obviously it
is plastic but it's kind of grippy so I
definitely like that that the Asus
branding like I said earlier speaker
grille right here at the bottom at the
actual bottom of the device you have a
3.5 millimeter headset jack you have the
micro USB charging port right over here
on the left side you have nothing but
these little pins right here for a dock
presumably on the right side you have
your volume rocker volume up and down
and of course your power button for
turning it on and off and bring it in
out of standby on the top you have
nothing but this little microphone right
over here so that's the hardware tour
for the outside on the inside of the
device you have the NVIDIA Tegra 3
quad-core processor at one point three
gigahertz with a 12 core GPU so it's
gonna be great for gaming one gigabyte
of RAM you have either 8 gigabytes or 16
gigabytes of internal storage depending
on which model you get there is no micro
SD card slot under the back you have a
4325 milliamp battery and device overall
you know it's pretty thin at just under
ten point five millimeters and it weighs
just 12 ounces so pretty light - so
anyway that's the harbor tour let's go
ahead and talk about the phone or the
device itself should I say the tablet
itself so I'm going to talk about first
what I dislike like I typically do my
reviews then I'm gonna talk about you
know what's just ok I mean it's not
necessarily bad necessarily good and
then finally I'll wrap it up with what I
like because I do like ending my
product reviews with a positive note so
let's go ahead and get right into it
alright so there are actually three
things that I don't like about the Nexus
7 tablet the first is the fact that
there's no SD card slot so with just 8
gigabytes or 16 gigabytes of internal
storage
it just doesn't cut it for me I mean
doesn't cut it for me on a phone so on a
tablet you know I'm not going to be
happy with it and you know that the main
reason is because people use tablets
more like they use their computers and
you just need more storage space
obviously there are other options out
there I mean you have the cloud you know
you can sync five gigabytes of your data
on Google Drive for free you can have
your music on Google Play or you have
services like Dropbox which do help out
I just feel like you know it should have
been a little bit more memory on here
maybe 32 gigabytes at least or you know
give us the option for a micro SD card
slot but we didn't get either you know
so definitely it's something that I
dislike the next thing I dislike which
is number two is the fact that there's
no HDMI output options so not only is
there not an HDMI port anywhere on
device that you guys could see from the
hardware tour but the micro USB charging
port doesn't work with that ma MHL
adapters meaning you can't use a little
adapters to connect to your HD screens
like you would on the Galaxy Nexus I'm
not sure if that was a cost-saving move
or if it's just a feature that they can
able be a software later I'm not sure
about it but I know right now it doesn't
work the USB charging port still works
as a USB host device so meaning you
could actually connect you know your
keyboard and mice to it you connect your
Xbox 360 controller to it so that's nice
but just really wish that I was able to
connect this guy to my TV especially
considering that Google actually gives
you the movie transformers for free when
you purchase the Nexus 7 tablet so
that's another downside and then the
last downside is the speaker on the back
I don't know if this is a thing with
Nexus devices but the speaker is just
not that loud I mean the Nexus 7 or the
Galaxy Nexus isn't loud you know I said
that in my review of that phone but this
guy you know it's not bad necessarily as
far as like it being really low but it's
like it's just barely louder than the
Galaxy Nexus I feel like that my Galaxy
s3 is actually louder than this and for
a tablet I just expect louder you know
the iPad is a lot louder obviously you
know this is a different price point
can't really compare the two in that
regard but I
which they they went with a little bit
you know I speak of that a little bit
louder I'm not sure if you could
download an app that amplifies the sound
haven't tried yet
but you know try it out but when it
comes to stock it just doesn't cut it so
those are the three things that I
dislike about the Nexus 7 tablet which
is actually a good thing concerning that
is only three let's go ahead and talk
about some of the things that I think
are you know just soso or okay first
thing is the screen now some people
might consider the screen you know a
plus some might considered a negative
items considered okay because yeah it's
an HD screen at 1280 by 800 but it's not
really impressive considering you know
with devices like the Galaxy Nexus the
galaxy s3 with the same resolution I
mean it's 1280 by 720 on those but those
guys are five inch or less display so
the PPI on they're a lot higher its 306
and 312 for the galaxy s3 in the Galaxy
Nexus respectively and on here with the
same you know with the seven-inch screen
with the same resolution or about the
same resolution you're just 216 PPI so
not that great obviously but it's not
horrible the backlight IPS display does
you know help out a bit I mean I feel
like it does look good I mean not gonna
like pick it up be like oh god the
screen is horrible but at the same time
you're not gonna pick it up and be like
wow the screen is you know blowing me
away so that's why I just put it as you
know something is just okay thankfully
it is a gorilla glass screen so it is
gonna be scratched resistant which is
definitely a plus next thing that thing
is just okay is the camera um honestly
just gets the job done when it comes to
video chat it's not really good quality
you know it's not the same quality like
you saw on the galaxies through the 1.9
missiles it's just one point two
megapixels um gets the job done
there was no camera app included and
probably because you know Google
realized that the camera isn't all that
great obviously just for a front faces
me for video chat but it's not horrible
man you download this little launcher
app and you could do things like
time-lapse you do panoramic pictures so
it's pretty cool not great not horrible
just okay and the last thing that is
just okay is the battery um I wasn't
particularly like blown away by the
battery but it definitely wasn't
disappointed
the battery on the back at 4325
milliamps does last you long enough a su
says that allows you up to eight hours
of active use and you know seems pretty
accurate to me I mean I haven't used it
for a hour straight yet but
I have used it you know for our to here
and there and it's last me like two days
then I charge it up charges up pretty
quickly actually like in an hour I think
I'm not sure but charted up pretty
quickly is able to use it again you know
playing games and things like that which
I'll talk about later
um but anyway battery is just okay no
you're not going to be disappointed and
that's I don't know in a lot of people's
book that's a good thing so with that
said those are the three things that I
found just okay but now let's talk about
what I feel like is actually really good
on this device and you know what
separates this tablet from some of the
others on the market alright so the
first thing is the size and the build
quality so first let's talk about the
build quality you know it's all black
you know device on the back is all black
on the front it's all black you know we
turn the screen off you can't see
anything we just all but you know the
only thing you might notice is the
front-facing camera but other nuts this
looks really sleek you have the silver
outlined over here and it just looks
really nice feels nice in the hand this
grouping material feels nice I feel like
it could take a drop you know I feel
like you take it pretty well without
getting too damaged especially that
gorilla glass screen you know I feel
pretty good about it you know I don't
feel like oh my god shot the whole day
make sure it doesn't drop so that's nice
to see definite like that when it comes
to sides I'm not just referring to the 7
inch screen I do feel like the 7 inch
screen has a lot of advantages over 10
inch screens but overall size you know
the bezels are pretty thin so the
overall tablet isn't all that big it
actually fits in my pockets which is an
amazing feat for a tablet you know I've
been in my basketball shorts and it fit
in my jeans so the obviously depends on
kind of kind of clothes you wear how
tight your jeans are whatnot but pretty
cool the fact that I could actually do
that I mean I'm not going to say I'm
going to do that walk around with it but
it's possible and it isn't all that bad
because it is pretty thin at under ten
and a half millimeters so it's actually
not about all that uncomfortable so
that's another thing that I really like
next thing that I like about the Nexus 7
tab and probably the main reason I mean
the main reason you're going to get this
tablet is the fact that it is a Nexus
device meaning you're going to get a
pure Google experience you're gonna get
Android the way Google designed it to be
you're gonna get the latest version of
Android all the time you know right here
you look at the settings Android 4.1.1
the latest version out and I'll show you
the little easter egg thing right
but anyway you know having a Nexus
device has bunch of advantages but the
biggest one to me is longevity first of
all it's gonna last you a lot longer I
mean typically next device get at least
one more system update then you know
other devices do and on top of that
you're going to get it a lot earlier
than others so while the hardware will
get older and older as time goes on the
software will stay up to date that's why
iPhone like the Galaxy Nexus can still
compete with some of the phones like the
galaxy s3 because it's a whole version
ahead that's a right now it takes like
maybe five or six months for other
devices to catch up so definitely
another thing that you know I would
consider you don't you don't have no
bloatware no manufacturer UI overtop of
it so just a really clean system
everything runs quickly I will mention
for a second that you know it looks a
lot like the Galaxy Nexus I mean if you
get the phone and actually compare the
two side-by-side let me see if I can
find wine really quick there it is
alright so you can see I mean they look
pretty much the same when you press the
app launcher and they look the same
scroll through your apps widgets looks
pretty much the same and that's because
they are they're both running Android
4.1.1 jelly bean and you can see the
speed is pretty similar to what the
project butter but there are a few
differences with the Nexus 7 as far as
the differences between that in the
Galaxy Nexus so you get the notification
bar
you can see with the Nexus 7 you
actually have the option to turn the
auto rotate off or on or just lock it
like that so that's definitely something
I really like this I wish they actually
include on the Galaxy Nexus you can lock
it like that so that when you turn it
sideways it's not gonna actually rotate
it when you don't want it to which is
great for when you're using the device
when you know in bed and laying on your
side so if that's something I definitely
like the other thing you'll notice is
the browser so if you go to the browser
and I want to type something in really
quick I'll go ahead over here and type
something you see the keyboard over here
this says you know the regular keyboard
on the Go button over here the go blends
a little bit higher up like where it
would be on a regular keyboard for the
inner button and then you have a.com
button which is pretty cool so obviously
with more you know screen real estate
it's gonna be easier for that to happen
but it just you know more tablet
friendly features on the keyboard on the
Galaxy are next
I'm sorry I'm getting the device names
confused now one note I want to talk
about the screen size really quick I
know why that was a previous point but I
want to point it out to you guys because
this is something that you know the main
reason why I like the size is because I
feel like the keyboard is really easy to
type on you know I've tried to type on
the iPad try to tap on 10-inch tablets
of Android tablets and it's just a lot
harder to do compared to here because
because I can reach all the letters with
really you know relative ease I mean I
could reach all heracross really if I
wanted to but on a 10-inch tablet I feel
like at the stretch my thumbs up all the
way just to reach G or H or something
like that so on here the typing
experience is gonna be a lot better um
anyway
let's talk about the next point and the
next thing that I really like on here is
the Tegra 3 quad core processor with the
12 core GPU so you can download the
Technos own app which I did from the
Google Play Store but made it one of the
advantages obviously of having a quad
core processor on here is everything is
super fast I mean jellybeans fastest is
fast in its own right but combine that
with the quad core processor you know
Google Chrome you know you have the full
like almost desktop version compared to
on the Galaxy Nexus or a phone you have
your tabs over here could actually move
them around by pressing and holding them
like that so you get the kind of the
same experience you would on the desktop
and honestly that thanks to one the
screen size but to the processor on here
is fast enough to support some of those
extra features loading up internet web
pages is super fast on here but the
gaming you know with the NVIDIA Tegra
zone and that you know the Tegra games
that are optimized for Tegra games for
example I was running shine really quick
and show you guys the graphics really
good turn the volume down before that
annoys me so I want to show you really
quick just the graphics on here because
it is pretty amazing so let me click on
this and we do comparison between the
graphics on a Tegra device versus a non
Tegra but as you guys see I mean this is
pretty much like console quality
graphics at least to me it looks like
and you know the Xbox 360 might have a
little bit better graphics play see a
little dislike the water splash right
there that's something you won't see on
a non techie device but anyway you get
the idea great for gaming with a 7-inch
tablet specially you connect the Xbox
ruses controller here it's really
awesome do I have this guy so that's
another thing I like
and that the main thing that you know
really draws a lot of people to the next
stem tablet if the first three points
that I mentioned don't is the price I
just $200 for the 8 gigabyte model and
$250 for the 16 gigabyte model you
really can't beat it considering getting
a quad-core you know this device with a
Tegra 3 you know 12 core GPU you're
getting an HD screen obviously it does
not the highest PPI but it's nice and
has Gorilla Glass and I mean you're
getting a pure Android experience so
really can't ask for more for just $200
$200 I was honestly sold a second I sold
the price you know I was sold knowing
that as a nice device let alone the fact
that they included a tiger even was a
you know a dual-core processor I
probably still would about it with a
Tegra 3 quad core processor you know
with 12 core GPU you know it's just an
easy sell so anyway that's what I think
of the Nexus 7 tablet that's my review
for it overall I give this device a huge
thumbs up I mean you know at $200 you
don't have much to lose
considering you getting so much with
this tablet really like if you're
looking for a 7-inch tablet
consider this strongly even if you're
considering a tab like the iPhone I mean
are the iPad you know you can save
yourself three hundred dollars you know
if you don't need some of those extra
features that you'd give the iPad maybe
the exercise and things like that or the
higher resolution if you don't need that
the Nexus 7 tablet could be a great
alternative so anyway that's it for me
and this review if you found it helpful
please hit the thumbs up or like button
and subscribe to the channel for more
reviews like this I maybe like I said
I'll be comparing the gaming on here on
Tegra device to non Tegra devices and a
whole bunch more so anyway stay tuned
