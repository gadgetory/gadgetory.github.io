most part we haven't heard all that much
about HTC's upcoming flagship in fact we
don't even know what is going to be
called logic tells us it'll be called
the m10 but some leaks suggest otherwise
in that HTC has codenamed the device
perfume internally but the name doesn't
matter what matters is what this phone
will be and whether or not it has a
chance against the likes of the galaxy
s7 and LG g5 so in this episode of what
we think we know we're gonna cover the
few but most interesting rumors and
leaks online that give us at least some
idea of what HTC has been cooking up so
as far as the design goes the m10 won't
look like the m9 which look like the m8
which look like the m7 and instead it'll
look more like the HTC a nine which look
like the iPhone 6 which look like the m8
which look like the m7 the Snapdragon
820 is pretty much a lock as the
processor HTC is going to go with along
with four gigabytes of RAM and 32
gigabytes of internal storage expandable
via a microSD slot
it looks like HTC will finally be
upgrading the screen resolution to a
quad HD AMOLED display which is
currently being pegged at somewhere
around 5.2 inches diagonally so let's
show the device featuring a home button
which will double as a fingerprint
scanner and if this turns out to be true
hopefully the m10 will come with
capacitive buttons in addition to the
physical button since having a physical
button for one thing and on-screen
buttons for another is just clunky now
I've got some bad news for you boom
sound lovers out there as HTC will
likely dish those dual front-facing
speakers in favor of a thinner and more
symmetrical design HTC will try to make
up for it though with enhanced boom
sound headphones that'll come with the
phone but being a big fan of those
speakers not having them is a bit of a
letdown
HTC S has some trouble figuring out
their camera situation with the last few
phones but that doesn't mean they're not
trying to get it right and some rumors
suggest that the m10 will feature a 12
megapixel Sony sensor with laser
autofocus this new sensor should strike
a better balance between low-light
performance and image sharpness compared
to HTC's previous models which were
either good at one thing or the other
the m10 will also likely feature a
water-resistant design which shouldn't
come as too much of a surprise since
water resistance seems to be the trend
with pretty much every flagship
smartphone coming out in two
sixteen and finally rumor has it that
the m10 will be announced sometime in
March with a release date early in May
like I said earlier not a lot has been
leaked about the m10 so far but the good
news is it shouldn't be too long before
we know everything officially anyways
and you can be sure that once we do
we'll be doing extensive coverage on the
m10 here in the channel so enable those
channel notifications through YouTube so
you don't miss out on any of our
upcoming videos anyways that is it for
me in this video give it a big thumbs up
if you enjoyed it and as always I'll see
you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
