with the galaxy no 9 and the iPhone 10's
max where the tennis max was able to
beat the no 9 by a pretty good margin so
today we're gonna be running another
speed test but this time with Apple's
new budgets iPhone and the iPhone 10 are
to see if Apple can get a clean sweep
over Samsung in 2018 taking a look at
the spec sheet dye phone 10 art comes in
at a price of 750 dollars which buys you
the same 812 Bionic chip that we saw an
iPhone 10s but where it's limited is it
comes with just three gigabytes of RAM
instead of four the note 9 on the other
hand comes in at a hefty twelve hundred
and fifty dollar price points which gets
you the snapdragon 1845 512 gigabytes of
storage and a whopping 8 2 gigabytes of
RAM so the question is will the new 8
hole Bionic chip and iOS 12 be enough
for dive on 10 are to overcome its
seemingly limited ram or will the lone
is 8 2 gigabytes ram be just too much
for the iphone to handle let's find out
with the power in your smartphone and
which artificial design intelligence you
can build a website run on your phone in
just minutes
no robot required big thanks to Wix for
sponsoring this video we're with their
AI building a site on your phone is as
simple as answering a few questions
uploading some photos and picking the
theme that best matches your style or if
you want more fine control you can use
the drag-and-drop editor on your
computer like I did to get everything
looking just the way you want either way
you can start your own website for free
at the link below all right you know the
drill we'll kick things off by starting
the stopwatches on each phone and then
popping in to Facebook where the no 9 is
able to get the step over the iPhone as
both phones start working on Starbucks
with Dai phone finishing the app first
as both phones begin working on word
where each will have to load the same
500 page documents once again Dai phone
10r finishes the app first already
moving on to excel with the no 9 falling
just a half step behind
but with iPhone also finishing excel at
a faster rate it's able to improve on
its lead heading into the second row
quickly snapping that selfie and now
editing the selfie here in Snapseed by
adding a filter and exporting the image
out to storage as two no.9 works on
completing the same task the iPhone
moves on to premiere where both phones
will have to export the same three
second clip the iPhone 10 R is able to
just rip through the export and move on
to the browser test while the no 9 is
just getting started with the export
where it looks like it's taking
significantly longer to do so allowing
the iPhone to gain its biggest lead as
it finishes up with the first game and
starts working on the second while the
no 9 is only falling further behind
stuttering in the browser test the note
9 is finally able to join the iPhone in
the gaming row where it takes
significantly longer to load in start
subway surfers allowing the iphone to
pull a full lap ahead as the note 9
moves on to flip diving while the iPhone
starts working on bullet force so things
aren't looking so good for the note 9 of
course we were kind of expecting things
to go this way given what we've seen in
our previous tests with the iPhone 10s
so the big question here isn't whether
or not the iPhone 10 R will complete
this first lap faster I think that's
obvious at this point but the real
question is can it finish the first slap
with enough of a margin where it can
hold on to its lead in the second
we're the iPhone 10 our three gigabytes
of RAM might prove to be insufficient so
it'll be interesting to see what happens
in the second lap which the iPhone is
about to enter as it finishes up with
Amazon and clocks in a time of 1 minute
and 51 seconds while the Galaxy Note 9
is finishing up with the ESPN and starts
working on Netflix so a nice little
cushion that the iPhone was able to
build for itself let's see if it could
hold on to its lead as we move back
through the gaming row where the 10r is
able to keep flipped diving open and
it's able to keep subway surfers open
something that the iPhone 10 was never
able to do with 3 gigabytes of RAM
however died phone does fail to keep
premier open opening the door for the no
9 to make a comeback with it just racing
through this second lab after finishing
the first lap with the time of 2 minutes
and 5 seconds the iPhone wasn't able to
keep the camera open and ready to go but
it does keep both Excel and word open
and it even keeps Starbucks open but it
fails at keeping Facebook open allowing
the note 9 and it's a gigabytes of RAM
to sneak up behind it and match its
total time of 2 minutes and 38 seconds
making this speed test a tie for the
updated speed test rankings with all the
other phones that we've tested check out
our website at the link below which we
created with our sponsor wix's easy to
use drag-and-drop editor anyways that is
it for me in this video thank you guys
for watching and as always I'll see you
in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
