off of your first purchase I'll have all
the information and links that you need
down below in the description so check
it out but with that said let's go ahead
and get right into it round number one
backdrop three two one
okay so after that backdrop the iPhone 7
only suffers a small little scuff by its
camera while the Galaxy s8 being the all
glass phone that it is gets its back
glass cracked it's not the worst scratch
in the world but definitely something
you wouldn't want to happen to your
seven or $800 phone giving this clear
advantage by a huge margin to the iPhone
in round number one round number two
corner drop three two one that corner
drops surprisingly didn't do too much
damage to either phone the displays are
perfectly intact even on the galaxy s 8
despite its thinner bezels however each
phone 7000 series aluminum does get an
equally ugly scuff mark on its corner
making it a tie in round number two
round number three space drop three two
one alright so both phones get their
displays cracked after that face drops
that eights damage is mostly contained
along the left side of the phone without
too much spider webbing going across the
screen whereas the iPhone screen has
spider webs all over the place on top of
that after going through our 10-point
inspection that we do after every drop
we found that the rear camera on the
iPhone just stopped working it literally
wouldn't show us anything when we're
trying to use it indicating a loose
connection or damage to the camera
module with even the flash light failing
to turn on the selfie cam was also
affected mainly due to the cracked glass
on the front giving the Galaxy s8 the
clear win in round number three bonus
round okay so with both phones still
technically having a fully functional
display we enter the bonus round where
unlike in the past we'll be dropping the
phones from higher up at four and a half
feet compared to just three feet which
should be a better test of each phone's
shock resistance first up is the iPhone
7 3
to one alright still working the touch
is working so uh again there's no way
you hear that good we wish you glock
everywhere but it's still working
gee oh nothing happen on screen all the
display starting to give up oh oh it's
disappearing oh my gosh oh I think the
home button work but yeah it's being
shot so after three drops the iphone 7 s
internal LCD cracked making the screen
completely unresponsive to the touch and
the damage just kept getting worse and
worse the more we try to use the phone
let's see if the Galaxy s8 can do any
better
three two one oh wow it'll get three two
one why do I be going everywhere but
it's still good
okay I see glass flying everywhere let
the phone don't work three two I think
it think it's still good still going Wow
so with the higher drop height we
figured ten drops was more than enough
clearly Samsung has done a really good
job here after ten consecutive drops the
s8 is still technically fully functional
however the glass in the front is now in
really bad shape with some chunks of
glass missing at the edges and
unfortunately it feels like the initial
damage on the back that the s8 took in
round number one has gotten
significantly worse with spider webs now
going all across the back right so with
four rounds in the books let's take a
look at the score card in the first
round of the iPhone easily beat out the
galaxy earning a near-perfect score the
phone's time to seconds the s8 dominated
in the third round and knocked out the
iPhone in the fourth making the overall
winner to Galaxy s8 that is it for me in
this video thank you guys for watching
and as always I'll see you in the very
next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
