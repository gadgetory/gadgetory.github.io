and one of the most exciting new
features introduced with Android 4.4 is
one that wasn't quietly working on for
the past two years and it's also hidden
deep down in kick-ass developer options
and a brand new runtime called art which
is short for Android runtime so what is
art and what does it do well we'll get
into that in a little bit but for right
now all you need to know that is with
art Google is looking to finally resolve
one of the long lasting issues that has
been plaguing Android since day one and
that Android as a system is relatively
slow in running applications now the key
word there is relatively slow because
when you pick up a phone like the Google
Nexus 5 the word slow or laggy or
anything of that sort
pretty much a lot of things that come to
mind but yet when you look at the app
performance um even a speedster like the
Nexus 5 relative to the app performance
on a phone like the iPhone 5s which of
course is running on an entirely
different operating system in iOS 7
you'll notice that while the two phones
are very close in terms of overall
performance the Nexus 5 still Falls a
little bit behind when running
third-party apps which leads to a
question that a lot of Android fans have
which is how is it that only the iPhone
5s with a dual-core 1.3 bigger chip can
outperform the Nexus 5 would take
quad-core 2.3 bigger chip well there are
a couple of potential explanations for
this one of which is the sekki shouldn't
judge a book by its cover
you also shouldn't judge the iPhone 5s
is a7 chip based solely on his clock
spinning cores because it's actually a
lot better of a chip than most people
give you credit for another reason is
that you have to consider the
differences between things like screen
resolution and also the different way
each operating system handles
multitasking both of which can easily
affect performance and then finally the
main one which is what we'll be focusing
on in this video is the different levels
of app optimizations that are present on
ego
so right now with Android the way most
apps are run is through what is called
the dalvik runtime which is the current
runtime on pretty much every Android
device out there that art have new
runtime we were talking about earlier
seeks to eventually replace now before I
go on any further let me take a step
back really quick and explain what
dalvik is in why Android uses it in the
first place so basically with the very
very high chance that I'm
oversimplifying this to a fault when the
developer writes an app he does it in a
programming language like Java that's
easily readable by humans or at least
humans other developers then before
publishing the app to the Play Store he
partially compiles it into what is
called bytecode which is sort of a half
way between human readable code that a
developer could read and machine
readable code that your phone CPU can
read after you download the app onto
your phone and launch it the dalvik
virtual machine in which most apps run
fixes halfway between bytecode and
translates it or compiles it into
full-on machine code that your phone's
particular CPU can easily understand
that Vic does this using what is called
the just-in-time or JIT compiler where
the compilation is done each and every
time you run the app just when it needs
to hence the name just in time now the
advantage and handling apps like this is
the developer doesn't have to worry
about coding is that for each and every
different type of processor out there
which on Android would be very difficult
to do giving you wide range of devices
and also because these apps are running
within a virtual machine they won't
affect the rest of the operating system
if something were to go terribly wrong
like forest closes or malware so so far
so good right but like I said in the
beginning the problem is as a system
Android is relatively slow in running
applications and while there could be a
bunch of different reasons for this if
the problem is that your apps are
running slow then you have to take a
good hard look at the very thing that's
running your apps and over the last two
to three years
that is exactly what Google has been
doing and now with Android 4.4 KitKat
Google has debuted their new runtime
albeit experimentally in art now in some
ways our is Ben
similar talvik almost like a dalvik 2.0
people and that it's still a virtual
machine which means they get to keep all
the different architecture support and
all that good stuff
but one of the big areas in where it
differs is instead of using these
just-in-time compiler where the code was
being compiled every single time you ran
the app or it uses the much smarter
ahead of time or a ot compiler where the
app is compiled just once at the time of
installation so what does this mean for
Android well it means that with our apps
will run more natively similar to how
they do in the iPhone and iOS and that
that we pre compiled before you ever
launch them in turn there will be one
less step for the processor to do when
you launch the app which theoretically
should result in faster app performance
better resource management and as a
byproduct of the lesser load on the CPU
potentially better battery life as well
all right so on paper all this sounds
really good but how does that actually
perform in the real world well I decided
to put art to the test and the first
thing I did was run a speed test with a
series of apps like I always do with a
nexus 5 using the current runtime and
dalvik on your left and the Nexus 5
using art on your right and as you can
see as I go through all these feet tests
here there actually is a difference
between the two now it's not a huge
difference by any means which is partly
because the Nexus 5 is just so damn fast
with that Snapdragon 800 that just kind
of flies through the process of
compilation but it also may be due to
the fact that art is still in beta and
isn't fully optimized yet though even
right now at this early stage of
development it's looking pretty damn
good
but there are some downsides to using or
over dalvik for one because the apps are
being compiled ahead of time ie at the
time of install apps do take quite a bit
longer to install with art than they
would with dalvik but it's usually only
a difference of a couple of seconds so
it's really not that big of a deal
especially when you consider that it's
only a one-time thing the second
drawback which in my mind is way more
significant is that these precompiled
apps can take anywhere between 10 to 80
percent more storage space on my Nexus 5
with the apps that you saw in the speed
test and all the stock apps that are
included
solution from dalvik to art took up four
hundred and sixty megabytes of extra
storage space which if you're already
running low on memory could be a pretty
big deal but at the same time our app
sizes are very similar to the apps I
just found on iOS which obviously hasn't
been that big of an issue for iOS users
so I can't really see it being a
deal-breaker on Android ok now before I
wrap up this video I know some of you
guys are gonna go and try to switch to
art so I must warn you that art is
considered experimental right now which
kind of explains why it's hidden deep
down in the settings and some of your
favorite apps may be incompatible I know
for me our deal and whatsapp are no
longer working in there are actually
quite a few more which are actually
detailed on a post on reddit which I'll
be linking to right below that like
button but other than that that is
pretty much it for me in this video like
I said in the beginning I think art is
easily one of the most exciting new
features in Android 4.4 not because it's
ready to use right now which clearly it
is and I mean it is experimental but it
does give us a little glimpse into what
Google has in store for the next version
of Android
whether that be 4.5 or 5.0 who really
knows but either way I'm really looking
forward to it if you guys liked the
video or if you found it helpful please
give it a thumbs up it really does help
out the channel and speaking of which if
you haven't subscribed to form up
already I'd highly suggest doing so so
you can be among the first to see more
mobile technology videos just like this
thank you for watching him I'll catch
you guys in the next video
