iPhone 7 and 7 plus aren't expected to
be announced until September that
doesn't mean we're completely in the
dark about what the new phones will look
like there have been plenty of leaks and
rumors online so in this video we're
gonna go over what we think we know
about the iPhone 7 the first thing you
can count on is an all-new design since
Apple updates the iPhones design once
every two years this time around the new
design is rumored to look similar to the
last but will likely be thinner won't
have a protruding camera lens and those
ugly antenna lines on the back may
finally get the boot but the new design
won't necessarily be the biggest change
as many rumors suggest that Apple will
be ditching the 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack so your fancy 3.5 millimeter
headphone zone unless you have an
adapter now I know what you're thinking
this is just another attempt by Apple to
squeeze every dollar out of the consumer
and I'm not saying that they won't
benefit financially but let's take a
look at the flipside for one plugging in
a compatible headphone straight into the
Lightning port will result in better
audio quality second ditching the
headphone jack opens up some internal
space for things like a larger battery
or what some rumors say will be another
speaker giving the iPhone dual stereo
speakers and finally not having to fit
in the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
along with the jacks surrounding
enclosure allows for a thinner iPhone
possibly as thin as the 6.1 millimeter
iPod touch so while there is definitely
going to be a short-term cost the
long-term benefit will most likely
outweigh that cost just like the 30 pin
to lightning port change bit moving on
to a less controversial change is it
rumor suggesting that the new iPhones
will use compound materials that make
the iPhone 7 water-resistant and allow
for those hideous antenna lines to be
hidden as far as the difference goes
between the iPhone 7 and 7 plus the 7
plus might get an extra gigabyte of RAM
compared to the regular 7 and will
likely feature a dual lens camera setup
that will allow for optical zoom and
better low-light capabilities both new
iPhones will feature Apple's new a10
chip that will likely improve
performance and battery life and Apple
may actually offer a 256 gigabyte
storage option instead of just capping
off at 128 whether or not the base model
will feature 16 gigabytes is unknown at
this point but I'm hoping that Apple
will start it off at at least 32
gigabytes to somewhat make up for the
extra cost of buying a 3.5 to lie
laughter and finally probably the most
interesting rumor out there is that
Apple is working with a start-up company
called energies that has technology that
can charge your devices wirelessly no
we're not talking about wireless
charging with a charging pad but real
wireless charging from up to 15 feet
away so your phone could be in your
pocket while you sit on the couch and as
long as the transmitter is within 15
feet of you your phone will get
automatically charged it sounds amazing
it also sounds a little bit too good to
be true but if it is true damn it I will
just take my money that is pretty much
all we think we know about the iPhone 7
and 7 plus at this point of course these
are all just rumors and speculation and
you can be sure we'll be doing coverage
on both iPhones when they are officially
announced later this year to make sure
that you don't miss any coverage enable
notifications through YouTube to be
alerted when any new videos drop thank
you for watching
give this video a big thumbs up if you
liked it and as always I'll see you in
the very next episode of what we think
we know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
