bumble calm and in this video I'm doing
a review on the app gym rat available
from the Android Market or should I say
the Google Play Store so the app is a
dollar 19 cents and honestly I feel like
it's worth it if you're serious about
going to the gym and following a
specific routine because this app could
definitely help you do so there are a
few reasons why I like this app and I'll
go over it as I'm giving you the walk
through the first thing is the UI so I'm
go ahead and hit on exercises as you can
see pretty much everything in this app
is just beautiful I mean it just looks
good on the phone so that's definitely
something I could appreciate but it
definitely doesn't lack in functionality
so it's got both beauty and brains if
you will anyway
let's say for example I wanted to work
out my biceps so I'm into my list of
exercises I hit biceps and it gives me a
whole list of you know workouts I could
do at the gym or at home for my biceps
so definitely something cool if I click
on one it'll give you little pictures of
how to do the exercise give you the
written instructions and give you a few
tips to avoid hurting yourself or
something that might help you so that's
definitely a cool feature of course you
have front and back side now let's say
you don't necessarily know what what
mostly you want to workout in are
specifically what muscle you want to
workout you can just hit muscle groups
and say you know what I just want bigger
legs or better better legs so hid legs
and it gives you a whole bunch of leg
workouts that you could do at the gym
where at home so pretty cool and the
reason why I'm staying at the gym where
at home is because there is an equipment
filter you could check or uncheck though
the workouts that you can't or can't do
for example if you don't have a pull-up
bar you can uncheck it and that way
it'll filter those guys out and you
won't have to worry about not having a
specific piece of equipment and you also
have a difficulty filter so if you
wanted all difficulties normal or
advanced you could do so so obviously
the advanced ones are gonna be a little
bit harder to do but if that's what
you're going for
definitely can do it on here so I'm let
me back out of here and go into the
routine section so there's a few
pre-loaded routines for example the
basic three day routine loaded on here
is
a three-day workout for arms legs and
back but the cool thing about it is once
you've loaded in your routine so you
could edit your own custom ones into
here but I'm just going to show this as
an example let's say I wanted to do
Monday's workout so I hit the play
button and I can choose what I want to
do so for example let's say I bench so
let's say I've been I don't know 50
pounds and I do it eight times I could
save it and as you can see right here it
logs it for me now let's say I wanted to
rest only five seconds in between which
obviously it's definitely realistic but
I want to show you the future I'll hit
save and rest and you can see the timer
right here it tells you how long you
have and then gives you a lower alarm
until you have to start your next rep
and you can do this over and over again
until you're done so as you can see I
finished the workout and I automatically
took me to the next workout which is the
incline barbell and you just go on and
on it's a good way to keep you on track
and on task at the gym increasing your
level of productivity and definitely is
something that I think that would help
you or at least this help me another
thing you could do is go over to
progress so you can enter in your weight
it'll calculate your BMI based of your
height and gender and in your age you
also do body measurements so I can
calculate your body fat and that way
over time you know as it changes you can
actually track your changes see graphs
showing you your improvements which is
you know motivating in itself you can
give the developer feedback pressing
this guy going into the settings lets
you create multiple profiles so if you
want to share this up with a friend why
you go to the gym you can do so you can
set the measurement users from the
English or the metric system you could
choose the first day of the week from
Monday or Sunday and a few other things
like setting the timer alarm sound on
and off and things like that there's a
few tools on here like a stopwatch and a
countdown timer if you need it at the
gym or if you need a time your workouts
and it's going to log this is basically
your you could see all your logs on here
based on your calendar so I could go for
today's and I can see what I've done
today and for one to yesterday I could
see what I did yesterday and
it's a good way to keep track of your
workouts so definitely something cool
you create a new log just from right
here and go from here and then the last
thing I want to show you is up when you
build your own custom routine for
example if I wanted to create a new
routine and I you know I'll just name it
whatever and let's say I want to do it
Mondays Tuesdays and Wednesdays hit
confirm I could actually go into the
exercise list and say I like a specific
exercise like this one I could add it
into my routine by tapping on this guy
and then hitting it saying what day do I
want it's why I select from Monday and I
could set my target sets target weight
and whatever I want hit confirm and I'll
add it to that workout and then next
time I go into my routine list
I'll have that custom built routine
right here with the workouts that I
added so definitely something cool
obviously I didn't add that work up that
I was just showing you guys but
definitely something to keep in mind
when if you're looking for an app like
this like I said it's only a dollar
ninety-nine I definitely thing's worth
it I had an issue with it
I emailed the developer he got right
back to me right away so definitely has
good developer support and I think the
ABS is only gonna get better in fact
when you hit miscellaneous it actually
says miscellaneous features are in
development and are due in future
releases so you definitely know that the
app is only gonna get better from here
on out and that's why I recommend it
alright that's it for me in this video
