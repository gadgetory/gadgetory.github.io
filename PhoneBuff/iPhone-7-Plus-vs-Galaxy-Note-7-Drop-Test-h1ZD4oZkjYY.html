finally able to get our hands on an
iPhone 7 plus we already dropped the
smaller iPhone 7 if you want to see that
video I'll be linking it for you down
below in the description but today it is
the iPhone 7 plus is turn to get the
fumble style treatment where it'll face
off side by side against the hot new
galaxy note 7 but before we get into it
I want to give a big shout out to tech
21 for sponsoring today's video so the
good folks at tech 21 sent us their new
evil tactical extreme case for the
galaxy note 7 asking us to do what we do
best and put it to the test and when we
did the case handled the back bottom
side and face drops like a boss as you
can see here while the case itself
suffered only a few tiny scratches
underneath the note 7 is still flawless
no dings no dents and most importantly
of all no cracked glass this is thanks
to tech 21s flex rock material found
inside of the case which absorbs and
dissipates the impact force and prevents
it from passing onto your device the evo
tactical extreme is available for both
the galaxy note 7 and the iPhone 7 plus
in a number of different colors so click
on that first link down below in the
description and get your phone the
protection it deserves alright let's get
to the drop test round number one back
drop three two one
all right so after the first drop the
iPhone 7 plus only suffers a few small
scuffs along its aluminum back with the
dual camera lens looking to have held up
just fine the note 7 on the other hand
has its rear glass cracked at the bottom
with the majority of the damage seeming
to stem right from where the glass
curves over so with it being metal
versus glass here in the first round the
iPhone 7 plus easily gets the win round
number to bottom drop three to one the
second drop gives both phones a few
scuffs along their bottoms with the note
7 scratches being slightly more visible
mainly due to its darker color it is
worth noting however that the bottom
drop caused additional damage to the
rear glass in the note 7 with the
original cracks now spreading all the
way up its back once again giving the
edge to the iPhone 7 plus and round
number two round number three side drop
three to one so both olds handled that
third drop about the same with their
7000 series aluminum bands getting a few
scuffs here and there but overall it's
nothing too serious making it a tie in
round number three round number four
bass drop three two one oh my god
so after that face drop both bones
unfortunately have their front glass
shattered as you can see here the note
sevens curved glass once again took the
bulk of the damage with some pretty
major cracks at all four corners
however the cracks on the rest of the
glass aren't as thick as the ones on the
iPhone 7s kind of making up for the
corner damage and making it a draw in
round number four bonus round alright so
with both on surviving the first four
drops they now enter the bonus round
where last time the note seven survived
fifty additional drops to its face with
the screen still remaining functional so
today we'll see just how many additional
face drops the iPhone 7 plus can take
before it technically can't make a phone
call all right three two one oh my god
this sounds nasty
but still works and drop keep thinking
again my headache oh shoot front-facing
camera gun way down let's not the camera
actually camera right there Wow Wow
good to see glass flying everywhere
okay there you go well I thought it was
L nope okay you know what dude I'm
throwing in the towel it's it's done
completely unresponsive now okay so
after the bonus round you've literally
got chunks of glass missing from the
iPhone 7 plus with the inside of the
phone actually being visible there at
the top left while the display still
technically turns on the screen is no
longer responsive to the touch hence why
we threw in the towel however it is
worth noting that the solid state home
button does still seem to be working
just fine so after all five rounds the
iPhone 7 plus earns itself a higher
ranking than the note 7 thanks mainly
due to it surviving the backdrop where
the note 7 failed pretty badly anyways
that is it for me in this video thank
you guys for watching and as always I'll
see you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
