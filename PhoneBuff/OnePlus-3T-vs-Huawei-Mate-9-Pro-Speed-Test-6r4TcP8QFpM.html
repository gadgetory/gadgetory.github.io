actually really excited about today's
speed test because today we're testing
to these fastest android phones in the
world with both of them holding their
own against the iPhone 7 plus and both
of them having a whopping 6 gigabytes
ramp now on the one hand you have them
made 9 Pro which if you follow me on
Facebook you saw the video I posted
comparing all the major mobile
processors where the cure 960 in 79
actually proved to be faster than the
Snapdragon 820 one inside the 1 + 3 T
but then on the other hand you have the
1 + 3 T which hasn't been the Android
speed test champ for like over half a
year now for nothing 1 plus s optimized
the hell out of this phone and they just
recently updated it to Android nougats
which may or may not improve performance
even more so with that said let's go
ahead and get right into it
okay so we'll kick things off by
starting to stopwatches on each phone
and then immediately taking a selfie
where the 1 + 3 T was able to snap the
photo faster than the main 9 foot it a
full lap ahead very early on in this
speed test but with the heavy-duty ABS
still left to go this is still anybody's
race
so as the 1 + 3 T starts working on laps
it the may 9 finishes up with Photoshop
Express now it will be interesting to
see if the me 9 in is Kara 960 processor
can make a comeback here and whoa
so may 9 is just blowing through laughs
it putting it only a split second behind
to 3 T as both phones start working on
subway surfers so halfway through this
first lap with a title of Android speed
test champ on the line both homes are
neck-and-neck with the main nine
actually taking the lead finishing up
with subway surfers and already working
on flip diving but the 1 + 3 T is still
right there behind it so we'll see if
the may 9 is able to create some
separation here where it looks like it
did finishing flip driving about a
second faster than the 3t as both ons
are now working on pizza fat so with a
few laps still remaining here in the
first lap and the entire second lap left
to go this thing is still far from over
as the 1 + 3 T is trying to make up some
ground on the main 9 in smash it
while the main time pro moves on to the
last row just blazing through Spotify
and moving on to ESPN where the 3t is
still right there behind it so it looks
like this one is going to come down to
the wire with the main nine Tests really
trying to hold on to its lead as it
finishes with
applix and works on loading both the
mobile and the full versions of the
amazon website so there you go the main
nine finishes the first part with the
time of 1 minute and 28 seconds while
the 3t finishes just three seconds later
with the time of 1 minute and 31 and now
the whopping 6 gigabytes of RAM on each
phone is being put to the test what both
of them having every app so far ready to
go subway surfers is open flip diving is
open and oh the may 9 isn't able to keep
pizza fat open allowing the 3 cheats to
complete the comeback and cruise to the
finish line with a time of 1 minute and
55 seconds with the may 9 pro at least
being able to manage to keep the
remaining apps open bringing it to the
finish line
ten seconds later with a time of two
minutes and five seconds making the
winner and still Android feat a champ
the one plus 3t that is it for me in
this video thank you guys for watching
and as always I'll see you in the very
next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
