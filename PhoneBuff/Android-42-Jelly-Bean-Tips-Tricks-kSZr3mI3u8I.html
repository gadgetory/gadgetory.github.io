and in this video will show you some
tips and tricks on Android 4.2 on the
Nexus 4 over here now some of these tips
actually came with Android 4.1 or even
on Ice Cream Sandwich but I'll go over
them here nonetheless because they are
some of the lesser known features so out
of the 10 tips I go over I'm sure your
phone boss will know a lot of them but
even if there's just one or two tips you
didn't know about I think the video will
be worthwhile so with that said let's go
ahead and get right into it so the first
tip is a shortcut to accessing quick
settings normally you would swipe down
from the notification bar and tap this
button over here to get to them but this
isn't all that quick but if you use two
fingers to swipe down instead it'll jump
straight into the quick settings which
is a lot well quicker the second tip is
another shortcut in the notification bar
but this time is tapping the clock on
the top left to get straight into your
date and time settings the third tip is
a shortcut to accessing Google now
instead of tapping the search bar here
you can swipe out from the bottom of the
screen and it'll open Google now up you
can do this from either side of the
screen too and it works regardless of
what you're currently looking at the
fourth tip is unlocking the developer
options in Android 4.2 simply go to the
settings and then go to about phone
scroll down to the bottom where it says
build number and then continuously tap
on it until you get a message letting
you know that you are now a developer
the fifth tip is unlocking the beam
fling your daydream screensaver to do
this you'll go to settings once again
scroll down to about phone and then find
the Android version option and tap on it
repeatedly this will open up the jelly
bean Easter egg and by doing this you
will have automatically unlocked the
bean flinger daydream now that Google
Chrome is the default browser on Android
the sixth tip is a shortcut to switching
tabs simply slide your finger from one
end of the screen to the other and
Chrome will switch between your tabs the
seventh tip is especially useful when
using new apps you're not always going
to be able to tell what a button does
just by looking at its icon so a great
way to find out without actually
pressing it is tapping and holding on
the button which will give you a little
textbox telling you exactly what the
button does the eighth tip is a shortcut
to switch keyboards quickly simply press
and hold on the spacebar and you'll get
a pop-up letting you switch this is
great especially considering that 4.2
has a new
built-in emoji keyboard ix tip is being
able to see what your original photo
look liked while editing a picture in
the gallery by swiping down and finally
the tenth tip is pressing and holding on
an app in the launcher to either see its
info or uninstall it instead of trying
to do it the long way by going through
these settings alright guys that's it
for me in this video pretty simple stuff
I know but if you liked it please give
this video a thumbs up and subscribe to
the channel if you haven't already thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
