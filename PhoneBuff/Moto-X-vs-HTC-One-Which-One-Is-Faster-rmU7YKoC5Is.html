fan in this video we're gonna be doing a
speed comparison test between the Moto X
and the HTC One to see not only which
one is faster but also how much of a
difference there is if any between the
two phones now the main story here is
the difference in specs or more
specifically the processors the HTC One
has a quad-core Snapdragon 600 processor
clocked at 1.7 gigahertz while the Moto
X has a dual-core Snapdragon s4 pro also
clocked at 1.7 gigahertz both phones
have 2 gigabytes of RAM and also share
the same GPU or graphics processor in
the audrina 320 and the only real
difference after that which could affect
performance hardware wise is the fact
that the HTC one's display is pushing a
lot more pixels with 1080p resolution
compared to a 720p resolution on the
Moto X which could put more of a strain
on the ones GPU ok so with the one just
dominating the Moto X in the boot up
test we're ready for some good old
fashioned benchmarks first of all it'll
be the all new Geekbench 3 as you can
see here the Moto X scored a slightly
higher score of 678 compared to 665 on
the one in the single core test but as
you'd expect in the multi core test the
quad-core HTC One really separated
itself with a score of 1934 almost 700
points higher than the 1257 that the
Moto X was able to achieve next
benchmark is an teensy where again the
HTC One score is higher with the score
of twenty-five thousand eight hundred
and nine over the twenty 1368 on the
Moto X and finally the last pen
chronicle run here is the old but still
fun to run benchmark in quadrant where
the moto x scores a nine thousand and
ninety five which is about thirty five
hundred less than the twelve thousand
635 on the HTC one respectable benchmark
scores all around but the edge
definitely goes to the quad-core HTC one
in this test but those are just
synthetic benchmarks right what really
matters is how these devices perform in
the real world so we'll load up a couple
of popular apps on each phone and see
how they do first app will run is score
mobile and we saw the content just a
split second faster on the HTC one
tapping on the game loads up at about
the same time on both maybe a little
faster on the Moto X and loading up team
info is as close
you can possibly get second Apple test
is the one that most of us use in
Instagram here loaded up a split second
faster on the Moto X profile a split
second faster on the one and this
picture here loaded up again at about
the same time next out will run is a
game actually in Temple Run 2 which uses
a lot more processing power than the
other two apps we test it so a little
bit more interesting of a test that
should give us some separation here and
as you can see it did with the game
loading up a little bit faster on the
Moto X than it did on the one ok so when
it comes to loading apps and games the
two phones are really close so close
that the difference between them is
negligible but if I had to give the edge
to any one phone it would definitely be
the Moto X alright so the next test
we're gonna be running here is one that
really stresses the CPU and transcoding
a video I've loaded the same video file
on both phones here and we'll Transco
them at the same time and see what
happens so as you can see the Moto X has
pulled away with a slight lead and
transcoding the video file and we'll
finish up first which is really
interesting since going into this test
in particular I expected the one to
outperform it considering the test is so
processor intensive but nope not the
case which is exactly why we do these
speeds hats on phone buff with that out
of the way let's move to the final test
in the browser speed test first site
we'll go to is of course bumble of calm
which was really close they load of the
pages differently so it's kind of hard
to tell but the content finished loading
up first on the one whereas the status
bar finished first on the Moto X tap
this article at the same time and while
these guys are loading up I'll let you
guys know that both phones are connected
to the same Wi-Fi network browsing
history and cache have been cleared so
it's nice and even and as you can see
both phones loaded up the page at about
the same time with the status bar
finishing up first on the Moto X going
to the verge calm the Moto X loaded up
the mobile site just a little bit faster
tapping on an article and we get the
opposite results this time with the one
loading the page faster so let's try to
settle this by going with a more
demanding test by loading up the full
and media-rich verge site so we're
seeing most of the content first on the
Moto X we see that at first and yep the
Moto X seems to be just one short step
ahead of the HTC One as far as the
browser test goes I think it's a little
too close to call so
I'll let you guys do it down in the
comments below but in the end both
phones are really really fast
both are smooth and just about
everything they do and you won't really
be disappointed with either when it
comes to performance if I had to choose
a winner and it's hard to do because it
was so close it would have to be the
Moto X right now the OS and most of the
apps out there just don't take full
advantage of those extra cores and with
less of a demand on the GPU due to a
slower 720p resolution the Moto X is the
slightly better performer alright guys
that's it for me in this video if you
liked it please give it a thumbs up and
