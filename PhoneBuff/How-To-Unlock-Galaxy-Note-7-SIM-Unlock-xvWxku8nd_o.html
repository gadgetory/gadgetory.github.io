quick video I'm gonna show you one of
the easiest ways to factory unlock the
samsung galaxy note 7 which will let you
use the phone on any GSM carrier or with
any SIM card around the globe now right
up front I want to let you guys know
that this method isn't free but then
again the money that you could save on
roaming charges when you travel and the
resale value unlocking your phone
actually adds to the phone could make it
well worth the cost so the process
itself is simple the first thing you're
gonna want to do is find your phone's
IMEI number the quickest way to do this
is by opening up the dialer hitting star
hash zero six hash which will open up a
prompt with your phone's IMEI the next
step is to get the unique unlock codes
that your phone needs from an unlocking
service our sponsors and trusted sources
unlock River so we'll be using them here
where you simply select the carrier your
phone is locked to which in my case is
AT&amp;amp;T here in the United States under
manufacturer you're obviously gonna want
to select Samsung and then under model
find the Galaxy Note 7 from the list of
Samsung phones you can unlock where at
least for AT&amp;amp;T there are actually two
versions of unlock so you can choose
from one is the standard 3 to 6 day
delivery while the other is an express
delivery for those of you who need to
get unlocked as soon as possible
note that the cost of unlocking varies
from carrier to carrier and these
standard or express options may not
always be available next enter in that
IMEI number that we got earlier making
sure to type it in exactly as it
appeared on your phone otherwise this
whole process won't work
and then finally type in a valid email
address where you want the unlock code
to be sent after that just hit unlock
now and within the quoted time frame
after purchasing you'll get an email
that looks something like this giving
you the unlock code that you need once
you have it turn off the note 7 and
search any non-accepted sim card into
the phone so in my case since this is an
18 t note 7 I'll be putting in a
t-mobile SIM and then power the phone
back on when the phone is done booting
up you'll get a message saying invalid
SIM as you'd expect and all you have to
do at this point is unlock the phone and
it
literally ask you for an unlock code
just enter in the unlock code that was
sent to you via email and boom your
Galaxy Note 7 is unlocked alright guys
that is it for me in this video we have
plenty of notes that we coverage still
in the way so stay tuned for that thank
you guys for watching and as always I'll
see you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
