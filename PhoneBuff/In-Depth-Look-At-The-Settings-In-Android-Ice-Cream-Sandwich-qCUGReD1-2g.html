comm and today I'm gonna give you a
quick look at the settings in Android
Ice Cream Sandwich so first thing you'll
notice in the settings is at the very
top you have these toggles for Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth so it just makes it a lot
easier to be able to turn them on and
off just by swiping them like that you
have data usage which is completing you
lets you monitor how much data your
phones using lets you see which apps are
using that data and also lets you set
warnings and limits to how much data
reform uses so if you're trying to avoid
let's say going over 5 gigabytes that
you carry imposes over just when you
pass you could actually limit your
device to 5 gigabytes and you don't ever
have to worry about overages let's go
ahead and click on an app you can see it
tells you how much app or how much data
the app is using and the foreground this
case about 90 megabytes in the
background is using about forty
megabytes so if I wanted I could
actually disable background data which
means that the app won't be able to use
data unless I physically open it myself
so I back back out of here and I'll hit
more nothing really new year compared to
Gingerbread other than of course Android
Beam which was introduced with ice cream
sandwich and now you can click on this
guy and just pretty much read about it
and I'd turn it on or off so I'm going
to leave it on back out of here and
let's go to sound nothing really new
here other than music effects which I
let you choose the control panel that
you want to use and it's pretty much all
that's new here let's back out under
display you have your normal settings
and post notification light so the
Galaxy Nexus has a little LED at the
very bottom and you could choose well
now you want that to flash when you get
a new message under storage just gives
you a breakdown of your storage space
and what its or what's using it up so in
this case apps seem to be using most of
my storage followed by pictures and
audio
alright just go to battery gives you a
rundown of you know what's using your
battery gives you a little bit chart see
the percentage cry over here so i have
twenty-eight percent and actually i
could actually click on it and i get
more detailed data so pretty much the
gist i'm getting from ice cream sandwich
order to settings is you just have a lot
more control over you know what's going
on you can see your data you can see
here storage space you can see your
battery under apps it's your normal list
so you could uninstall them if you want
or clear data and of course under
personal you have your accounts and sync
nothing new here locations there is
nothing new security only thing the
thing of course here is you have your
face unlock they cassette and what's
interesting you gals to do no none which
means that you could have no lock screen
at all so when you press the power
button it's just up and running which is
pretty interesting like i said nothing
new here under languaging input you have
your keyboards you have google voice
typing an android keyboard stock and as
you can see google voice typing is
actually enabled because if you disable
this guy and enable this one you just
have the keyboard with this guy you have
both which is kind of weird but that's
the way it is voice recognizer you
choose use google's voice recognizer or
in this case vlingo and that's because i
download of lingo onto my phone and you
can also choose your voice search
settings and your text to speech output
another thing that's new is a pointer
speed so this is I think more so for
tablets like the Asus Transformer Prime
if you have a trackpad it's almost like
a mouse on the phone give you a more
desktop like experience under backup and
reset you just have the option to select
whether or not it backs up your data
like the apps that you download on the
server when you login up for the first
time on Ice Cream Sandwich it will
download all the apps automatically to
your phone and you can choose whether or
not you want it to do that
and of course you could do a factory
reset back out of there under date and
time nothing new here under
accessibility you have your normal
options like large text and talk back so
it reads I'll out loud what you just
selected developer options USB debugging
stay awake like you've normally seen you
could also force GPU rendering which is
kind of cool and I can choose the
transition scales animation skills right
here so you just decide how fast it goes
and whatnot pretty cool to see those
options available and of course under
about phone just have your Android
version number and the ability to look
for updates but that's a quick look at
the settings I mean it just looks a lot
nicer just like everything else in Ice
Cream Sandwich and my favorite part
really has got to be these three having
the toggles right here the data usage
and I find myself using these toggles
now instead of downloading a widget to
do it because all you got to do is swipe
down from here hit settings so that's
pretty much it on the settings this day
from phone booths calm thank you for
watching the video and don't forget to
