in this one I'm going to show you how to
configure your APN settings on your
Android phone so first thing you'll want
to do is hop into your settings and then
under Wireless and network you're either
going to go to mobile networks or hit
more settings and then go down to mobile
networks and then from here you're going
to tap on access point names so that's
what APN stands for we're going to tap
on this guy you can see I already have
APN settings for t-mobile
but that's not what I'm going to show
you here I'm going to show you how to
add new APN settings so I'm going to hit
menu and then new APN and maybe you just
given this list this is where you can
input your information so I'll just tap
on name for example and I'll hit AT&amp;amp;T if
that's the carrier I wanted to add APN
settings for hit OK and then I'll just
continue to add all the information I
have for AT&amp;amp;T so in the link below I'll
have all the settings for AT&amp;amp;T for
t-mobile and Verizon but I'm just
talking up finish this but anyway that's
how you do it you know once you get the
port numbers you just tap on this guy
and you know put in the port number hit
OK and then go back once you're done
though you're gonna hit menu and then
save so I'm just gonna hit save and
obviously my APN is empty I haven't
filled it all the way I'm just gonna
exit out of this because I don't have
all the settings we're not it's going to
make the video too long to go through
them anyway I'll show you my t-mobile us
APN settings so you see it says t-mobile
us you have the APN and you have all the
port numbers and everything like that so
this is what it looks like once it's
done and once you have this you'll be
connected you'll have MMS you have your
internet and all that good stuff so
anyway that's pretty much it for me in
this video if you found it helpful
please hit the like button and subscribe
and don't forget to visit the link in
the description box below for the APN
settings for your carrier I'll also try
to put all the APN settings in the
description box below as well so thank
you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
