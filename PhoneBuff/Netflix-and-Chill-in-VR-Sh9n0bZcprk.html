you
what's up guys David and Jane here and
virtual reality is no longer just a
gimmick with mobile tech getting better
and better
it's pretty safe to say that BR is
almost ready for the masses so in
today's episode of a perk wrap we're
going to be taking a look at the Netflix
app on the Samsung gear VR or what I
like to call the gr now since I have a
bunch of experience actually using VR
we're gonna have Jay put on the headset
and walk us through the Netflix app
giving us his initial impressions you
ready okay home screen and click on my
good friend Netflix me and Netflix go
way back and that is freaking amazing
this TV is huge
this makes me feel bad about my
apartment but what's my place is shame
I'm sitting on a red couch and there's a
Netflix remote and I can't touch but my
aunt wants you right there there's a
couple that Netflix shows daredevil I'm
Asian
in that guide Asian and that's all I'm
sure that is I'm looking it basically
operates just like you would on if
you're using a remote or a controller at
home with your regular TV but instead of
remote you can see the little crosshair
that you actually point to each item and
click so I'm assuming you just go here
and then click on the side of that there
you go and the first thing that pops up
is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3
fantastic and it's loading up and it's
literally oh my goodness
I was like I just cut brain fart because
the the immersion is really really
awesome everything just turned off all
that all the entire room just literally
turned off alright so I probably tapped
the button aside and now everything
turned back on in the room so it's back
to kind of normal um I guess I can look
oh there go so I just have to look at
the options in the corner here and oh I
don't know how to get well here's a
return button
so you're the kind of look around the
entire screen which I guess could be
kind of annoying because you literally
like look here in here when maybe the
guy had like a central console where I
could control everything in the center
of the TV movie let me ask you this yes
how do your eyes do it um I feel really
good they don't hurt at all
back me when I own a Virtual Boy no it
was almost a kind of same exact design
too like that red you're like it's a
giant face helmet oh no I don't feel
nauseous I wear glasses now and I'm
pretty sure it's because it's beautiful
but the brick oh boy so do you see any
pigeons ah yeah I do
oh it's it's not to the point where it's
like pixels on a PlayStation 1 or you
know old Xbox or is that too much play
yeah it could be better with this phone
being as high as high quality it is as
we go in the future it's probably just
get better and better but this feels
doesn't feel like a gimmick at all
that's a three that's a great thing
about it it doesn't feel like a Kimmy so
could you see yourself using this
watch now yes I don't have to think
about that it's yes first and foremost I
guess I gotta ask you what do you think
app or crap it's definitely an app
compared to some other experiences you
told me about VR like people getting
sick or - because I'm right about did
not get sick at all wearing this thing
there are some cons right yeah so what
would you say would ya won't say they
are though one thing I do I do want to
say and I noticed that after we watched
playback is it bucks your hair up you
didn't say anything like it's more so
depending on the actual headset not
necessarily the app right true so like
the pixel does agree better that's due
to the screen on the phone
the weight is due to the headset itself
and the phone being mounted onto there
yeah and then the hair the hair we're
gonna count down as a car y'all just
wear hats like this yeah as long as he
always wears a hat you could have
orientate it to be fully relaxed Debbie
if you watch the video I'm like sitting
up the entire time and I want to lean
back
I want to lean back that couch and be
able to look up and watch but whenever I
lean back I had to look down to actually
watch that I'm watching so being able to
reorient eight where I could literally
make it like like up so I like when
you're laying down yeah really it's it's
about the pros yeah what are they to you
like what does the biggest one the
biggest one for me is just launching
that that was really expecting something
that was lackluster well okay Netflix
it's literally gonna be the same thing
exact thing I see on my on my TV without
all my other devices but no they went
out of their way to create a tire room
that is pretty much it for us in this
video and see you guys in the very next
episode so stay tuned we're hat and wear
a hat wear hat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
