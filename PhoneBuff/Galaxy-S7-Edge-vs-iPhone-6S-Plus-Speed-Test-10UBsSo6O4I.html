again with another video this time the
speed test you have all been waiting for
between the galaxy s7 edge and the
reigning speed test champ in the iPhone
6s plus taking a quick look at the spec
sheet on one side you've got the
Snapdragon bearing of the s7 with a
whopping 4 gigabytes of RAM and on the
other side you have the a 9 packing
iPhone 6s plus
coupled with just 2 gigabytes ram but
specs of just specs that's why we do
these speed tests here on the channel
and with that said let's go ahead and
get right into it alright so we'll get
things going like we always do by
starting these stop watches on each
phone and then jumping into these system
apps where the iPhone gets the step-over
the galaxy s7 as both phones head into
the gaming portion of this first lap so
at this point it's worth noting that the
iPhones resolution is lower than the
galaxy s7 s which may give it a bit of
an advantage as in theory there will be
less stress on its GPU compared to the
s7 GPU but either way the iPhone 6s plus
looks a lot pulled ahead by a full app
with it starting to work on smash hit
while the S Evan edge is still working
on clash of clans but of course the s7
still has plenty of time to make a
comeback as we're only just halfway
through this first lap with a whole
nother lap left to go with the iPhone
finishing up with Photoshop mix it's now
heading into lab sit where each one will
have to render a time-lapse of the same
exact video file so this just may be
where the Galaxy s7 and its octa-core
processor can make its comeback through
sheer processing power but damn it's
going to be hard as the iPhone 6s plus
just rip through laps in and is already
almost done with Netflix and heading
into Spotify with a finishing up lap
suit the SM and edge doesn't look to
have made up any ground on the iPhone
with the iPhone finishing up the last
leg of this first lap in loading up both
the mobile and desktop versions of the
Amazon website so the iPhones official
time for the first lap is one minute and
17 seconds and it looks to keep its lead
during the second lap where each app is
being reloaded to test whether or not
it's kept ready to go in the background
and so far it looks like the iPhone is
having no problem with that
speaking of which it'll be interesting
to see how the s7 does in this second
lab as it finishes the first lap with
the time of 1 minute and 33 seconds
since Samsung phones have typically
struggled with RAM management and from
the looks of it things haven't changed
at least not with this many apps having
to be loaded in the background with the
s7 RAM management not being able to keep
at least these games ready to go which
further pushes it behind the iPhone in
the speed test so with the iPhone
finishing up the test with a total time
of 1 minute and 54 seconds we'll go
ahead and fast-forward the galaxy s7
edge to the finish line where after
having to reload three of the four games
along with two other apps it clocked a
total time of 2 minutes and 35 seconds
ok so what the hell happened it actually
looks like the SM edge did worse than
the note 5 in the same test at least for
that first lap but the thing is the s7
is supposed to be the latest and
greatest from Samsung so there are two
possible explanations I can think of the
first is that the s7 and the note 5 have
different chipsets but with the
Snapdragon 820 doing relatively well in
benchmarks will give it the pass
at least for now which brings us to the
second possible explanation which is
most likely that the s7 suffered due to
it being encrypted on android 6.0
whereas on the note 5 it came
unencrypted on android 5.1 but with that
said both the note 5 and the s7 have
there RAM management issues making the
winner and still fumble style Swedish
champ the iPhone 6s Plus that is it for
me in this video you can bet they'll be
more speed tests just like this and
possibly a rematch coming sometime in
the future so give this video a big
thumbs up if you'd like to see that
thank you for watching and as always
I'll see you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
