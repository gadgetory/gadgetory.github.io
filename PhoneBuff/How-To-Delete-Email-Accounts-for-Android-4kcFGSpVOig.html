this video i'm gonna show you how to
delete an email account whether it's a
normal email account or a gmail account
off of your Android phone so the first
kind of email account to show you how to
delete is a regular one so what you
gonna do is go ahead and open up your
email client and hit the Menu key or
this guy right here and go to your
settings and from here you'll see your
list of usual accounts I only have one
I'll go ahead and tap on it and we're
gonna do is scroll down to the very
bottom and hit this remove account it
says are you sure you want to delete the
account hit OK and there you go I've
deleted it off my phone now for the
gmail account it works a little bit
differently you can't just go ahead and
open up the app so what you do is go
over to your phone settings and then go
over to the accounts and sync so what
I'm gonna do here is you can see I want
to delete this email account I gave this
click on it and then same thing what
you're gonna do is hit menu and then
remove account so I hit remove account
and this is are you sure and hit okay so
with the Gmail account you want to make
sure you actually want to do it because
it does delete all associated contacts
and calendar events with that gmail
account with your phone so it remove
account once your shirt and there you go
I am done it's off my phone that's
pretty much it for me in this videos
