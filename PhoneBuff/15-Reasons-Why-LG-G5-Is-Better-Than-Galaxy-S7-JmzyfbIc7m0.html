and the galaxy s7 are two of the highest
end Android phones available so in this
two-part video series we're going to be
comparing them foam buff style looking
at 15 reasons why each phone can be
considered better than the other let's
get right into it
reason number one bigger screen the
larger 5.3 inch display makes viewing
content and videos that much easier on
the eyes two removable batteries a
removable battery means you can swap in
a fresh one whenever you want or replace
an old defective battery somewhere down
the line three magics lot the modular
design on the g5 allows you to literally
upgrade your phone with things like a
hi-fi DAC for better audio or a camera
grip for better controls for USB type-c
with USB type-c you can plug in your
charger in either direction making it
especially easy to do so when in the
dark number five ultra wide camera in
addition to its main 16 megapixel camera
the g5 also has an 8 megapixel ultra
wide camera that captures a 135 degree
viewing angle letting you fit in way
more into a single photo or video than
you ever could on the s7 6 better
selfies the higher resolution on the g5
s 8 megapixel front camera translates
into cleaner and crisper selfies 7
durability the metal design on the g5
can handle drops better than the nearly
all glass galaxy s7 at least when being
dropped on its back eight IR sensor a
built-in infrared sensor allows you to
control your TV blu-ray player and more
turning your phone into a remote control
9 better speaker the speaker on the g5
is not only louder than the s7 s but it
also produces richer and fuller sound
number 10 customizable buttons the
customizable home touch buttons let you
put the home back and recent keys in any
order you want while also giving you the
option to add shortcuts for things like
pulling down the notification bar 11
cleaner back
unlike the s7 the g5 isn't a fingerprint
magnet
and won't pick up anywhere near as much
hand grease 12 knock on a double top of
the screen turns the display on and off
from the lock screen letting you
interact with notifications quickly and
easily knock-on can also be used as an
alternative password method if
fingerprints aren't your thing 13
always-on display while both devices
have always-on displays for quick
information at a glance the g5 supports
more third-party apps so you won't miss
out on any notifications 14 24 bit audio
a 24 bit DAC and 24 bit streaming gives
you better quality sound when using
headphones or a Bluetooth speaker and
finally reason number 15 shortcut keys
from the lockscreen all in the screen is
off you can double press the volume down
key to launch right into the camera and
the volume up key to quickly launch LG's
Notes app alright so those are the top
15 reasons why the g5 could be
considered better than the s7 but
remember the word better is subjective
so be sure to watch the galaxy s7 s
version which will be annotated
somewhere here on the screen and linked
for you down below in the description
