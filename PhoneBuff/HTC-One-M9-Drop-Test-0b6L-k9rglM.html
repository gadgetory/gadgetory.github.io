popular demand I am back again with yet
another drop test this time with the HTC
One m9 so if you saw the last video you
know that instead of doing your typical
drop test we're going to be doing it
Bombo of style where we use a
professional drop test machine to help
us get more consistent drops and we use
two different services in both tile and
concrete to help us better determine a
phone's relative strength so that way
you can actually compare one phone drop
results to another last time the iPhone
6 got a durability score of 5.3 and the
galaxy s6 got a score of 3.7 so how will
the HTC One m9 stack up well let's go
ahead and find out okay so we'll start
this thing off by dropping the HTC One
m9 from one meter onto tile alright so
despite that dramatic bounce the m9 had
after the drop the back the phone
actually fared pretty well with only
minor scuffs and scratches mostly to the
right edge but nothing too bad in this
next drop we're dropping the one m9 from
one meter onto its side so the phone
still works with the only damage from
that drop to the bottom of the phone
with a large scuff on the bottom right
along with some light scratches across
the bottom left now it's time for the
tough one with a face front drop from
one meter on to tile
so while the screen is working and fully
functional the glass over top of it has
shattered spider webbing all the way
across and can definitely cut your
finger if you use it enough all right
time to take it to the next level and
test just how tough the m9 is by
dropping it on its back again but this
time on an even tougher surface in
concrete so another crazy balance by the
m9 after the back drop but this time it
does sustain more damage than the back
drop on tile as well as kind of to be
expected with a tiny little dent near
the center along with heavier scratches
and scuffs along the bottom insides of
the back of the phone moving on we're
dropping the one m9 on its side from one
meter onto concrete all right so the
phone is still working with all the
damage coming to the bottom where it
made impact with additional scuffing
going all the way across and as you can
see they're actually pretty heavy
scratches at least when compared to the
other phones that we've tested all right
you ready
this last drop is the hardest drop in
the whole test dropping face front from
one meter onto concrete and the screen
still works and is fully functional of
course the glass is now even more
shattered than it was before with some
pieces actually looking like it'll fall
out if you shake it but nonetheless the
phone still works so if you absolutely
needed to use it you technically still
could of course at the risk of cutting
yourself so in the end the HTC One m9
gets a phone book durability score of
five point five beating both the iphone
6 and galaxy s6 as well as taking the
top spot in our durability chart at
least for now anyways if you liked the
