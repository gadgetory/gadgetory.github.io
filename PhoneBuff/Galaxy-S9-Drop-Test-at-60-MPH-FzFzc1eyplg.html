shield what's up guys david here and we
already did the official form of style
drop test on the galaxy s 9 where the
rear glass in the phone completely
shattered after the very first drop but
today we're gonna be doing another drug
test this time with the protection of
rhino shields full cover case in these
solid suits and you know just to kind of
take things to the next level instead of
using our drop test machine we're gonna
be testing the case with the quickest
production car on the planet in the
tesla model as p100 D because why the
heck not now we'll be testing these
solid suit with the galaxy s 9 in this
video but the case is available for the
galaxy s 9 plus as well as other phones
like the Google pixel 2 and the iPhone
10 so I'll be putting all the links in
info you need down below in the
description but I'm excited so let's go
ahead and move on to the test alright so
for this first test we're gonna be doing
something that probably could happen to
a lot of people and that you know you
pull up in your car you check your phone
when you set it down in your lap and
then you forget about it you get out of
your car and smash let's go ahead and
try that test minding my own business
oh screen is good and the case only got
a small little scuff right there but oh
one right there as well but other than
that phone obviously still works looks
good and we are ready to move on to the
next test
for the second test we're doing another
situation that might happen and that's
let's say you have a bunch of groceries
you walk into your car you put your
groceries away you set your phone down
and you know while you're getting
everything situated you walk into your
car you get in you forget about the
phone and you drive off and
hypothetically you have the fastest and
quickest production car in the world
what's gonna happen all right Jay have
you ever been driven inside of a test
have you ever been inside a Tesla with
the full launch I've been a test before
but I haven't been in the Tesla that
basically just launched from zero to how
fast we go zero to 60 and at two point
two seconds so I'm gonna eat my lunch
all right ready beam me up Scotty two
that make me a little nervous I'm glad I
peed before that I want to come that
would have been like kind of crazy no
like almost choked to my tongue on that
one jeez so let's see what happened to
the phone cuz that being launched that
let's see what happened it landed face
fracture I don't know how it landed but
its face down right now turn this guy
around oh thank god
alright so the phone is clearly working
the case got some more scuffs along the
top rights think big speech trying to
launch but so far so good so now we're
gonna take it to the next level Ronnie
shields says that these cases can
survive drops of at least 11 feet so
we're gonna actually test that theory we
hit a ladder in here we're gonna drop
this thing from just over 11 feet climb
up this guy so when I raise my arm up
we're talking about close to 12 feet in
3 2 1
whew that is the protective screen cover
that we had on that's not the screen
right here so that's okay oh that scared
me for a second so as you can see screen
is still working
oh no pics beyond that again alright
case just more dinged up then it was oh
okay that's the drop point that's where
the impact hit so you got scuffed up for
sure but the galaxy s 9 and underneath
perfectly fine the glass on the back
perfectly fine was protected by the back
cover here and again the screen is
perfectly fine so that's it pass
all right
the phone was able to survive the lap
toss the trunk launch and the 11 and a
half foot drop from the ladder it only
leaves you with one option right we got
the car got the case on the phone so
we're just gonna go ahead and toss this
thing out the window
is it gonna survive probably not
considering that you know if you drop a
phone from 11 feet the impact a twitch
in the gun speed I wish the phone's
gonna hit the ground it's gonna be a lot
less than the speed we're gonna be
throwing it at so let's see what happens
it's gonna kind of frisbee it out the
window and try not to hit our camera
operator I'm gonna have to push it a
little just a little bit
so actually I was like around 60 miles
an hour I think I didn't know where the
phone is watch I run it over is that it
oh yeah that's it I don't know I don't
know like the clock and maybe when I hit
them for fit survives I'd be very very
surprised oh no oh no I don't know okay
I so it looks like the impact the case
kind of came off a little bit but
surprisingly at 60 miles an hour but
bones still work so we got a crack right
here I'm assuming that was the impact oh
my God look at look at that is this
shredded oh I'm actually really
surprised to survive I don't know
that is insane so the function you know
what see what the the glass looks like
on the back so the glass in the back is
good the front it's fully functional Wow
and we didn't actually have the screen
protector on for that test oh my gosh so
you got more damage there's turned off
screen so moral of the story guys is the
phone can survive a drop when you have
the Rhino shield case on here the solid
suits but you want to do when you're
driving 60 miles an hour probably not 11
fill it ladder you might be okay but for
most of your daily jobs you're gonna be
fine I'm really impressed with this case
so anyways that is it for me in this
video thank you guys for watching and as
always I'll see you in the very next
