this video we're doing a comparison
between the Super AMOLED screen on the
samsung galaxy s3 and the super lcd2
screen on the HTC One X so both these
screens or you know HD screens meaning
they're 1280 by 720 in resolution so
they're 720p the difference is on the
EVO in this case our HT 1x it's 4.7
inches going diagonally versus 4.8 on
the galaxy s3 meaning that this guy is
going to have a slightly higher ppi
because the screen is smaller the same
resolution at 312 PPI compared to 306 so
it might look a little bit sharper on
this guy based off the spec sheet but
we're going to test that in real life to
see know exactly how it looks I'll be
testing a couple of things the sharp
prints obviously 12 only testing the
brightness and three the blocks you know
see you know which ones darker and
whatnot so let's go ahead and start with
the first test we'll just do the
brightness you see it best here with
this white background you see definitely
the super LCD screen on the HTC One X
definitely looks a lot brighter than it
is on the galaxy s3 now keep in mind um
the camcorder i have is making this look
a little bit darkness because this is
brighter it kind of dims this one out so
if i cover this you see it gets a little
bit brighter but anyway um is picking
that up for a reason meaning this one's
brighter and it definitely feels like
that in person I feel like this one has
a little bit more of a blueish hint
compared to you know this the pure white
you see on the HTC One X so anyway
that's that let's go ahead and look at
the small text over here so I'm with
zoom out i'm using google chrome on both
phones so i'll just go ahead and try to
bring this close up you see you know how
clear looks a small little text on the
website so you can see you could read it
pretty clearly you don't have to zoom in
at all are when you're actually looking
the phone which is a great thing about
you know HD screens not only are these
ones bigger but also you know you don't
have to zoom in so that's nice let's go
ahead and see how it looks on the galaxy
s3 screen and the same thing I mean it's
very readable you know you don't have to
zoom in at all to
be able to see it I'll say it does look
a little bit sharper on the HTC One X
but it's barely noticeable honestly and
it's probably due to the higher ppi but
um maybe that's the reason why I'm
seeing it because I know the people has
hired but anyway that's that let's go
ahead and take a look at you know
another or actually look at these little
icons so first we'll look at the galaxy
s3's icon so i just pay attention to
these top icons so this is the chrome
icon gmail play store and then youtube
so obviously all them look really sharp
let's do the same thing over here got
chrome Gmail oh this time we have
quadrant and then YouTube so uh let's go
ahead and do a side-by-side well let's
do a side-by-side with the YouTube icon
so I'm gonna put youtube up here and
YouTube over here that way I can bring
it up nice and close we'll try to make
it level so that way that are exactly
the same distance apart from the camera
and on the right is the One X on the
left of the galaxy s3 and I I mean you
can see both of them look pretty clear
you guys can be the judge as far as
which one looks clear from the
viewfinder when I'm looking at it does
look a little bit sharper on the HTC One
X but you know that just means go ahead
and you know what will rotate that
direction um we'll just look at it the
other way like opposite will put this on
actually do a different icon will do the
chrome icon I'll put this on the right
side and this on the left and basically
go this way just in case you know
there's some kind of advantage the
camcorders giving it to the Euro right
side so anyway same thing so now this
time on the right you have the galaxy s3
on the left you have the HTC One X and
I'll try to bring it closer up together
so so really hard to tell the difference
I mean obviously both them look good
mice where is the pencil display on the
galaxy s3 now I haven't really noticed
anything as far as the quality being
less I know that the sub pixels are
shared we're on the LCD to screen and HD
1x they're not but really I haven't seen
difference I mean I think you really
have to go under a microscope really um
to the natural I both of them look
absolutely great you know i'll go ahead
and show you the zoom in on some text
nick see it looks absolutely smooth you
know it's really sharp really nice so
anyway don't really notice that anything
on there as far as the sub tile layout
and of course on here we're not going to
see that because it doesn't share
sub-pixel so both of them you know look
really sharp let's go ahead and do the
up black background test now so so far
you know the edge is going to the super
lcd2 screen on the One X because it is
brighter and it's a little bit sharper
due to the higher PPI but let's go ahead
and look at the black background so
let's open up the camera app and you
know what I'll do I'll just zoom in on
both of them so let me zoom in right
here so you can tell the block is
definitely a lot darker on the galaxy s3
over here compared to how it is on the
one xml if you look at the One X on the
left you could tell that it's on you
know you see that the little pixels lit
up displaying that black but on the
right you know you can't even tell that
the displays on that's because they're
not the pics were actually off which
that's why you're getting such deep
blacks with the AMOLED screen so anyway
that is that so I mean overall you
really have to kind of pick you know
what you're looking for if you want that
brighter screen with a little bit better
you know sharpness you're going to go
with the one on the HTC One X if you're
looking for better blacks and also it
also help your batter luck because it is
turning out the pixels you're going to
be looking at the Super AMOLED screen on
the galaxy s3 so both of moxie really
nice screens both are more HD but that's
the comparison thank you for watching
