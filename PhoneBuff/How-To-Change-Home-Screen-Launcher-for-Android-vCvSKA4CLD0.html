and today I'll be doing a video on how
to change your home screen launcher I
currently have three launchers installed
I have the touchwiz launcher by Samsung
I have the launcher pro launcher right
here that I currently am running and I
also have the gingerbread launcher as
you can see when I press the home button
it doesn't give me an option to change
when you first install a launcher it'll
give you the option but I've set the
launcher pro launcher as my default
launcher so now when I press home it
just goes straight to this one now let's
say I wanted to change it there is no
option in Android for you to really
change it so the way you have to do it
is you have to go to applications and
then you go to manage applications so
because I've set launcher pros my
default I want to find it in here and my
list of apps so I pass it there you go
launcher pro and what you want to do is
hit clear defaults because this is says
the default home screen I'm going to
clear it so now that I've cleared it
when I press home I now have an option
of which launcher I want so I'll just
choose the touchwiz launcher for now and
I didn't hit the I use as default so
that way you know I don't have to do it
again but that's how you do it and if
you do want this as default as the
default launcher so I'll just go ahead
and do it for you guys to show you I'll
select this and TouchWiz and now I'm
running this launcher and when I press
home it's defaulted on this and if I
wanted to go back to the other one same
process except for this time I would
look for the touchwiz launcher in the
manage applications and clear the
default on that alright that's it for me
