up seeing a new iPhone a lot sooner than
we thought no I'm not talking about the
iPhone 7 that still slated for all the
way in September what I'm talking about
is the iPhone S II which is rumored to
be Apple's new budget smartphone that
the company is expected to announce on
March 21st now what is the iPhone se and
what will it look like
well some rumors say that will look
almost exactly that the iPhone 5s except
for with a slightly more curved design
other rumors say it will look more like
an iPhone 6 and iPhone 5s lovechild
either way the rumor mill is convinced
that in one way or another the SE will
closely resemble the 5s so much so that
at first rumor had it that the device
was going to be called the iPhone 5se
but that rumor has since been shot down
as Apple supposedly decided against
calling a new iPhone with part of the
name of an old iPhone as most consumers
associate the number after the word
iPhone with how new it is while the
iPhone se will most likely look similar
to the 5s on the outside it won't be the
same on the inside the new phone is
rumored to have the iPhone successes a 9
processor under the hood along with the
m9 motion coprocessor it also comes with
an upgraded iSight camera a 1642 million
battery touch ID and NFC for Apple pay
and maybe most importantly a 4-inch
screen so for all of you who have been
wanting a new iPhone without having to
go with a bigger screen this may just be
the iPhone you have been waiting for but
don't get it twisted this isn't a
compact iPhone success it's still going
to be a budget iPhone which means that
there will be some sacrifices what those
sacrifices will be we're not entirely
sure but one the main ones this being
rumor right now is the lack of 3d touch
another sacrifice might be the camera as
some rumors suggest a 12 megapixel
camera while others suggest only in 8
megapixel camera as far as pricing goes
the iPhone se is rumored to sell at the
same price point as the nearly
three-year old iPhone 5s which is
currently selling at 450 bucks in the US
now obviously that isn't the lowest
price point out there for a budget
smartphone but then again not many
budget smartphones have a chip as
powerful as the Apple a9 to go along
with a premium build and touch ID the SE
is rumored to come in the same color
options as the iPhone success in gold
silver gray and pink and may possibly go
on sale in as little as four or five
days after the events which again is
room
which take place on March 21st but aside
from that that is pretty much what we
think we know about the iPhone se you
can bet that we were doing a bunch of
coverage on the phone if and when it
becomes available so be sure to enable
those channel notifications so you don't
miss out on any of our upcoming videos
thank you guys for watching give this
video a big thumbs up if you liked it
and as always I'll see you in the very
next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
