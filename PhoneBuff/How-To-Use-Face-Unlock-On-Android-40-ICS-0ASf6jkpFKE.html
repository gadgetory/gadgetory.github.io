Ofcom and today we're doing a quick
video on how face unlock works on
Android Ice Cream Sandwich and the
Galaxy Nexus so with that said I'll go
ahead and show you how to do it
you're gonna go to settings and then
you're gonna go to security and from
security you're gonna set screen lock
and then face unlock and now you can see
right here it says face unlock is less
secure than a password painter pattern
I'm someone who looks similar to you kid
unlock your phone and your data is kept
private so let's set up so you see these
little circles right here you have to
put your face inside of it so I'm gonna
you can see that these little circles
circling around and I says face captured
so we'll see how it works I'll hit
continue I had to do a backup so just in
case the times that it doesn't see you
say I had night in the dark it's not
gonna be able to see your face so you
gotta set up a back back up so I'll just
put 0 0 0 0 confirm that and let's see
how it works so I'll do it 5 times just
to show you how accurate it is so 1 4 1
2 4 2 3 3 4 4 even when I fill up my
cheeks 5 4 5 alright so even when I
stick out my tongue it gets so it's
pretty accurate as you can see let's do
a situation where it doesn't see me
let's look right at the camera alright
you can see promise you for the backup
password and you can hit it hit OK and
so you still get in your phone you'll
have to worry about not being able to
see it they did have a plan for that and
as far as security goes it definitely
isn't as secure as using a pan-arab
password like like the warning said you
know someone that looks like you I
haven't seen anybody looks like me yet
that
was has been able to make this work yet
but I have taken a picture of myself on
another phone put the camera to the
other phone screen and it does unlock so
someone could definitely you know have a
picture of you and unlock your phone now
honestly if the person who steals your
phone has a picture of your face you
know they're probably not going to steal
your phone to Paulino you but then again
you know if you want to be super scared
you don't want anybody getting in your
phone even people we know then you know
I wouldn't recommend it but I love it I
find it to be faster than actually
having to you know put in my pattern or
put in a pin you just go like this
unlock it I mean that's really quick
it's almost like not having a password
at all so that's pretty much it this is
