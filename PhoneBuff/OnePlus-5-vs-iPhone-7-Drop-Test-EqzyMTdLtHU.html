last job test I told you guys that if
the video hit over 10,000 likes that we
would do the 1 plus 5 drop test next and
you guys killed it we got over 11,000
lights on that video so as promised
today we're going to be doing a fumble
style drop test with the 1 plus 5 going
up against the iPhone 7 but before we

you've always wanted to but with that
said let's go ahead and get to the drop
test round number one backdrop three two
one
all right so after that backdrop both
balls fared pretty well which I given
though they both have metal backs isn't
really all that surprising the iPhone
does have a slightly deeper scuff mark
on its camera compared to the one pluses
but then again the 1+5 has more scuff
marks across the rest of its back making
it a close one in round number one round
number two corner drop and three two one
good one so thankfully that corner drop
didn't cause either phones display to
crack with each phone instead being left
with some scuff marks on their corners
now neither of these phones have the
kind of results I would want on my
personal phone but after taking a closer
look at the damage it does seem like the
oneplus wise damage is actually worse
with the scratches being deeper and more
prominent than on the iPhone giving the
iPhone the edge in round number two
round number three base drop three to
one Oh
after that base drop the iPhone 7 has
this front glass cracked while the
oneplus fives display is surprisingly
unscathed there are no cracks on it and
the display is still fully functional of
course there are a few light scratches
but nothing you'd really notice unless
you put it under direct light whereas on
the iPhone not only is it badly cracked
but even worse the rear camera and flash
are completely inoperable like they just
won't turn on or launch and the selfie
cam has also been affected by the
shattered glass so overall an impressive
win for the oneplus 5 here in round
number three bonus round okay so with
both phones still being technically
usable we entered the bonus round where
we drop each phone directly on to steal
from much higher up which should put the
shock and impact resistance of each
phone to the test
last time the iPhone 7 survived not one
not two but three hard drops from 1.5
meters before the display became almost
unusable so let's see if the oneplus 5
can fare any better and three two
ah oh that did not sound good but
screams off Oh screech stop turning on I
feel it I feel it vibrating the home
button I think that's it only one Wow
okay so disappointing results from the 1
plus 5 while the glass still isn't
cracked most likely thanks to the
relatively raised lips compared to the
more curved glass on the iPhone 7
unfortunately the display on the 1 plus
5 just won't turn on like we waited a
while we tried resetting it but nothing
the AMOLED display underneath the glass
is dead and what's weird about it is the
phone still technically responds to the
touch I can press the power button and
swipe up and I hear the phone unlocking
but either way it's obviously completely
unusable after just one drop giving the
edge to the iPhone in round number 4 all
right with four rounds in the books
let's take a look at the score sheet
where both phones scored high marks in
round number one the iPhone got the edge
in round number two the oneplus files
just dominated in round number three and
while both phone struggled in that bonus
round the oneplus 5 gets a big fat zero
in round number four but despite its
disappointing result in that last round
thanks to its great performance in that
face drop the one plus five still
manages to be the overall winner here in
this drop test anyways that is it for me
in this video thank you guys for
watching and as always I'll see you in
the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
