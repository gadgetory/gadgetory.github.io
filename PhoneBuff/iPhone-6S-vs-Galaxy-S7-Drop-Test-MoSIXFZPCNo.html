asked for it so here it is today we're
doing a poem of style drop test between
the iPhone 6s and the Samsung Galaxy s7
if you haven't seen one of our drop
tests before the format is simple we
drop each phone on its back then on its
bottom then on its side and then finally
on its face using a professional drop
test machine if a phone happens to
survive all four drops to where it can
technically make an emergency phone call
it moves on to the bonus round where we
drop it
over and over again on its face until it
can make that potentially life-saving
call yes the phone gets weaker and
weaker with every drop but since we're
using a professional machine the drops
will be consistent so we'll really get
to see each phone's relative strength
all right let's get right into it
drop number one the back three two
so the iPhone got a tiny scuff mark
there at the bottom with a few more
going along the rest of the back but
totally something you can live with
after seeing what happened to the s
sevens back which just got completely
shattered
drop number to the bottom three two one
both won't handle that bottom drop with
no problem with these silver bands on
each showing very little damage outside
of a few barely noticeable scuffs drop
number three the side after that drop
both the iPhone success and the galaxy
s7 have bite marks going across the side
with the s7 damage looking only a little
bit worse mainly due to the darker shade
of gray drop number four the front so
the glass of the iPhone 6s cracks with
that face drop but it did fare better
than most of the other phones we've
tested while the s7 screen not only
cracked but the internal display stopped
working as well making the phone
completely unusable bonus round so with
the s7 throwing in the towel the iPhone
6s moves on to the bonus round where we
drop it over and over again until it
technically can't make a call three two
one
so going on three two one he gone he
gone fuck still go I can see the light
my lad oh I don't worry so Lorex it's
all like there one see what so there you
have it the iPhone success edges out the
galaxy s7 in this form of style drop
test making it the second most durable
phone we've tested here on the channel
but anyways that is it for me in this
video thank you guys for watching it as
always I'll see you in the very next
episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
