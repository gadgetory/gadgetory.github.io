Volcom and in this video I'm gonna show
you how to clear out or otherwise delete
your web browser history on safari on
your iPhone or iPad so I'm going to show
you that I do have web browser history
on here and the first method to delete
it is a hit clear and then clear history
this will actually wipe everything out
that we are looking at but it won't
actually delete just about everything
that's on there so the way you actually
do that is go to your iPhone settings
and from here scroll down to where it
says Safari so you can see it says
Safari right over here so I'll tap on
that guy and again you'll see that same
clear history option but this time
you'll see the option to clear cookies
and data so I'll go ahead and do that
and clear out the cookies and data and
cookies and data have things like your
username and email addresses that you
enter in on forms it'll clear it out so
I'll go ahead and go back to the browser
now and you can see the history has been
wiped and that's pretty much it this is
