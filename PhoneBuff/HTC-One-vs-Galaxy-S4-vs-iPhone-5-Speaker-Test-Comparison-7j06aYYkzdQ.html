buff and in this video we're gonna be
comparing the speakers on the HTC One
the galaxy s4 and the iPhone 5 to see
not only which speakers are the loudest
but more importantly which speakers have
the best overall quality but before we
begin the test let's take a really quick
look at each device the speaker so on
the HTC One you have two front-facing
stereo speakers that are optimized by
Beats Audio which for the most part
helps give the speaker's a little bit
more bass on the galaxy s4 the single
mono speakers found in the more
traditional spot at the back of the
device and lastly on the iPhone 5 the
single mono speakers at the bottom note
that there is only one speaker here
though even though it looks like there's
two okay with that out of the way we're
almost ready to begin you'll find the
decibel count for each test in the
bottom left corner of your screen but
try to pay closer attention to the
actual sound quality of each smartphone
so in this first test we're gonna
position each phone in a way where the
speakers are lined up and facing our
decibel meter from about a foot away
with the track that most of you phone
buffs are somewhat familiar with listen
up
according to the decimal meter the
iPhone 5 was the loudest however in my
opinion it offered the worst sound
quality out of the three with the HTC
One giving the best overall quality and
the galaxy s4 falling somewhere in
between alright now that last test was
done in a way where the speakers were
optimally placed but this next one
better demonstrates what to expect from
the speakers when you're holding it like
you normally would in your hand
turn up those speakers now if you dare
in my opinion the hc1 with his dual
stereo speakers sounded the best here
once again though the iPhone 5 was
clearly the loudest out of the three
wait a minute
what if the iPhone 5 speakers are louder
then what's all the buzz about the one
speaker well the results here don't lie
which to be honest actually confused me
a bit so I tinkered around a bit and
found that for some sounds like this
song for example turning beats audio off
actually helped make the speaker
significantly louder
pretty big difference right but
beatsaudio optimization doesn't always
make the volume less which will
demonstrate here with a song that was
produced by the face of Beats Audio
itself dr. Dre as you can see or hear in
this case the HTC one was the second
loudest out of the three smartphones
barely being edged out by the iPhone 5
however in terms of quality it easily
topped both of its competitors to put it
another way the iPhone 5 in the galaxy
s4 felt like we were listening to music
on a smartphone the HTC One on the other
hand made us feel like we were actually
in the club okay
not really but you guys get what I mean
let me know down in the comments below
what you guys think but I've got to tell
you the HTC One speakers just blew away
the galaxy s4 and the iPhone 5s in my
opinion as far as which phone came in
second place it's a close call but I
think the audio quality was better on
the s4 overall while the iPhone 5 was
generally louder alright guys that is
pretty much it for me in this video if
you found it helpful please give it a
thumbs up and if you haven't already be
