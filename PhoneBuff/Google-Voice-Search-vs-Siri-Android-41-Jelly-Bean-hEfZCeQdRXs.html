calm and then this will be doing a
comparison between the new voice actions
or voice search on Android 4.1 jelly
bean compared to Siri on the iPhone 4s
so last time these two met with the
older version of voice action Siri did
actually beat it out mainly due to the
fact that was Syria are able to speak
more naturally to it and it would get
what you wanted
but it looks like Voice Actions has
actually resolved that issue I'm adding
new features to be able to support it so
we'll go ahead and start our test so
what's the weather like so you can see
both of them gave us the right answer
now is actually say what's the weather
like
and they're both able to respond
correctly or before that command might
not have worked on voice actions so
we'll go ahead and ask it another
question like will it rain tomorrow will
it rain tomorrow so we both we got the
same result on both phones but you can
see that you know on voice actual you
could actually more natural questions
just like you are on Siri and that gives
you the answer but the difference says
you get the answer a lot faster so far
on Voice Actions so let's go ahead and
to further into this has to see how each
performs when was Barack Obama born so
we got the answer already
and we're still waiting on theory and
now we got the answer so maybe a good
five six seconds before Siri voice
Actions actually loaded up our answer
which is nice because when you're using
your voice you want your answers almost
instantly otherwise you just type it in
and google it so let's go on to the next
question we'll ask it how tall Michael
Jordan is how tall is Michael Jordan
Jordan is six feet six let me think
about that would you like to search the
web this case we got the answer right
here and on the iPhone 4s is asking to
do a web search so go ahead and tap on
web search and you can see how much
longer it would take to get the answer
here we got the same picture on both
phones now so you see it's pulling it
from Google anyway and you know pretty
much this is the same source so we've
got the answer now but we had to go
through an extra step and there's a lot
faster on voice section so let's go on
to the next test is ask it who won the
angels game last night so who won the
angels game last night so there you go
you can see that we already got the
answer on voice sections and boy or boy
sir and for some reason Siri didn't
respond usually it does give me the
answer to that but we'll go ahead and
exit out of there and let's ask it
another question what's the speed of
light in miles per an hour so we got the
answer nice and easy what I was looking
for on Voice Actions and I don't even
know what I got here I just got some
kind of formula which that's not what I
was looking for we got meters per second
squared I was looking for miles per hour
so again a little bit more accurate on
voice actions go ahead and try something
else like texting somebody so text
Google ok well that didn't work
Siri uh I stopped dancing let's go back
looks like this guy got it but let's try
it one more time because Siri messed up
right there thanks google what are you
doing so you can see here's my contact
strategy could send it and now I could
send it on Siri so both of them got it
there but seem to be a little bit faster
on voice Actions slows try another one
like remind me to walk my dog
remind me to walk the dog in 25 minutes
so what school will be here with boys
out hinges it automatically set the
alarm we set a little bar was loading
and basically I had an option to hit
cancel if I didn't want it otherwise it
automatically sets it we're on Siri yep
actually hit confirm or say yes which
you know to me I find it kind of
annoying but depends on you know your
personal preference there but it is
faster on Voice Actions once again was
can't cancel on this guy and I mean
that's pretty much I mean you guys could
see the difference in Baltimore pretty
accurate if anything I'd have to say
that voice actions our voice search is a
little bit more accurate we'll have to
wait till iOS 6 gets released officially
so we can see you know how well Siri
works I know they added a lot more
features to Siri and you know tune in
for more videos subscribe to the channel
I'll definitely be doing a comparison in
the future as soon as that drops but
anyway that's it from me in this video
