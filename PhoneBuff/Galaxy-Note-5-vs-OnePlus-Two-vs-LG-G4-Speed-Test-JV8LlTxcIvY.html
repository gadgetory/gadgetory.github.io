again with yet another video this time a
speed test between the Exynos and four
gigabyte packin samsung galaxy note 5
these Snapdragon 810 and 4 gigabyte
packin 1+2 and the Snapdragon 808 and 3
gigabyte packin LG g4 now we're not
going to be doing just your normal speed
test and instead we're gonna be doing it
foam buff style where we race each phone
through what I like to call a virtual
obstacle course where the first lap
consists of testing the raw processing
power of the phone and the second lap
consists of testing the phone's
multitasking abilities so that way
together you can get a better overall
look at a device's performance so with
that said let's go ahead and get right
into it alright we'll go ahead and kick
this thing off by starting these stop
watches on all three phones and going
straight into the first row of system
apps where the note 5 takes an early
lead over the pack with the g4 right
behind it and the 1+1 falling to third
as all three phones are working on
Temple Run 2 it's worth noting that both
the g4 and the note 5 have much higher
resolution displays in the oneplus 2
which theoretically should make things
like running games less taxing on the
oneplus 2 but as you can see didn't seem
to make any difference with the note 5
already finishing Photoshop mix and with
this Exynos processor just blowing
through this video transcoding section
actually faster than any phone I've ever
seen dude before the g4 is transcoding
the same video file at a much slower
rate but looks to be running at about
the same rate as the oneplus 2 so it
doesn't look like there's much of a
difference between these snapdragon 808
on the g4 and the underclock snapdragon
810 on the oneplus 2 with that huge lead
it created for yourself during the video
transcoding the note 5 is now working on
the last leg of this first lap and
loading the full 18 t website and
finishes the first lap with a smoking
fast time of 1 minute and two seconds so
the question going into the second lap
is whether or not the note 5 will keep
all the apps open in the background
which has been a problem for Samsung
phones in the past and it looks like the
note 5 is no exception without having to
reload Temple Run 2 and now
smash it despite having four gigabytes
of RAM so this really opens the door for
the g4 which just finished the first
stop with the time of 1 minute and 21
and the oneplus 2 which finished at 126
to make a potential come back and with a
nope I of having to reload every single
app the g4 is making a last-second dash
to the finish line and the nope vibe was
able to hang on and finish with the time
of 1 minute and 37 with a g4 coming in
second place by a second at 138 and the
oneplus 2 coming in third finishing
eight seconds later with the time of one
minute and forty six alright guys that
is it for me in this video if you liked
it give it a thumbs up to show you lovin
as always I'll see you in the very next
episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
