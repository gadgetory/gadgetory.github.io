in this video and we're doing a
comparison test between the t-mobile HTC
One S here on the left and the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus the unlocked HSPA+ version
here on the right so I'm just gonna be
doing a couple of speed comparison tests
like a boot up test a browser test
running a few apps and things like that
just kind of get a better idea as far as
which phone performance faster obviously
we expect the 1s important password with
the s4 1.5 gigahertz processor compared
to the 1.2 gigahertz Oh Matt 4 460 on
the Nexus but you never really know how
a device performs tell you testing and
real in the real world so we'll go ahead
and turn on both devices they're both
off right now so press it at the same
time for like 4 seconds let go and let
them go off so you can see nothing on
the screen on the 1s froze up and sold
right now so there's a bit of a delay
not sure if that's just my device or if
it's like that on all devices but we'll
go ahead and see which device loads up
the OS the fastest
all right so you can see on the 1s the
home screen showed up a little bit
before this the Galaxy Nexus that is
still in the animation here there you go
you can see the unlock screen and now
you see the unlock screen on the Nexus
so it is faster than the 1s I'd say by a
second or two at most followed by the
Galaxy Nexus not too big of a difference
I'll go ahead and unlock both phones and
they're both running on the same Wi-Fi
network this so you guys know I did wipe
out the browser history each because I'm
doing some browser tests but before I
get to that I'm just going to launch
some apps so first type of watch is the
stock messaging app on both phones just
to give you ideas how fast the browser
or the messaging app opens so I present
at the same time and you can see it
opened up faster in the 1s not sure if
that's the animation thing or if that's
just the pure speed on the 1s we'll go
ahead and do a another test on Flixter
to get a better idea
so we'll do Flixter and again you can
see the 1s is about a second or two
ahead of the Galaxy Nexus will hit home
at the same time and I'm not sure again
if this is just the animation difference
but the 1s does feel faster more so than
it is we'll go ahead and open up score
Center now so score Center
and again you can see that the one has
opened up this time a few seconds ahead
of the Galaxy Nexus will hit home at the
same time and now will run the camera
app so just to see how fast he launched
the camera on each phone so I'll go
ahead and hit camera at the same time so
one two three and again you can see that
the one has definitely beat out the
Galaxy Nexus here so so far we're
getting results as expected again I just
wanted to see the difference between the
two I'm sure a lot of you at home one or
two as well well go ahead and open up
Google Earth on both phones now so we'll
hit Google Earth open up on the 1s a
little bit faster again we'll search for
Las Vegas so Los Vegas and I already
searched Las Vegas here once before so
hit him at the same time now this one is
probably going faster in this case
compared to the 1s again because I did
load it up in the past but it's not I'm
not trying to test which one opens up
faster as far as the location what I'm
actually gonna load up is the 3d
buildings on each device and I'm
actually gonna cut out on the video to
let them look for about a minute so you
guys could get a better idea as far as
how well the 3d buildings load up on
each device so I'll go ahead and make
sure 3d buildings are on so in this case
it's early on so I hit back over here
I'll make sure they're on and like I
said I'm gonna pause the video come back
in about a minute or so after both
devices are done loading and we'll see
how each performs alright so I went
ahead and let both phones load up for
about a minute or two and because this
guy did load up first or I had it loaded
up beforehand I'm gonna go ahead and
zoom in and zoom out on this guy first
so I'm just gonna move this out of the
way and focus on this guy so I'll go
ahead and zoom in and zoom out and try
to pay attention to how smooth it goes
in now keep in mind this isn't
necessarily testing just the CPU it's
testing both the CPU and the GPU and
this guy has the HDX 540 clocked higher
then it is on the Nexus S or the galaxy
s like you've seen it's at 384 I believe
anyway I'll go ahead and do a 360
spin so this app are a Google Earth with
the 3d buildings really taxes the
processors on these phones hopefully it
gives you a better deal as far as how
that one performs we'll go ahead and go
on the 1s now and again zoom in and zoom
out and this guy has the audrina to 2001
a brag and s4 and hopefully this gives
you a better idea as far as the
performance goes from my experience just
trying to run these apps the Google
Earth app keeps crashing on the 1s I'm
not sure if that's a compatibility issue
that has to be addressed with Google
Earth as you can see a crash right now
so for right now we have to give the win
to the Galaxy Nexus if that's a update
or if an update can actually fix that
issue then we'll redo the test but for
right now like I said the Galaxy Nexus
is a clear winner we'll go ahead and
close out the recent apps that are on
the phone so close up these apps all
right so now we'll go ahead and go to
our final test which is the browser test
so open up the browser on both phones at
the same time
alright so both of them loaded the
homepage about the same but of course
they're different home pages so we'll go
ahead and go to phonebook comm on each
phone so phonebook calm and phonebook
calm so they're both bookmarked here at
the top I'm just gonna tap them at the
same time so one two three and you can
see the 1s seems to have a lead on the
Galaxy Nexus loaded up a picture first
and seems like it's loading up there you
go it's done so this guy is done now so
you definitely see it loaded up the
website a bit faster I'll go ahead and
zoom in and zoom out give you guys an
idea as far as the zoom quality or the
how good the zoomin and zoom-out is on
each phone so you see it's pretty smooth
on the goes to Nexus I will try to zoom
in nice and big on here and we'll do the
same thing on the 1s and really smooth
on here I feel like it's actually
smoother on the 1s than it is on the
Galaxy Nexus we'll go ahead and load up
another one
page so we'll load up I'll just click on
this top article right here so one two
three it's gonna zoom this guy out and
it's done and you can see the Galaxy
Nexus followed shortly thereafter so
again the one SS faster in this regard
and of course that's because the
processor is faster both are running on
android 4.0 or so actually 4.0.3 this is
actually 4.0.2
still haven't got the updated 4.0.4
alright enough of that website let's go
ahead and go to NFL calm so NFL comment
this guy
nfl.com on this guy and we'll hit go at
the same time so one two three and again
it finished first on the 1s we'll scroll
down to the bottom and go to the desktop
version so one two three I'll zoom out
so we get a full picture and I'll let
you know when this guy is done loading
in fact they actually loaded it our
finished loading about at the same time
well let's go to one more site just so
we could claim a winner we'll go to
yahoo.com
and Yahoo com1 here hit enter at the
same time so one two three and again it
seemed to load up a little bit faster on
the 1s for the mobile site let's see if
we get a clear winner with the desktop
site and it looks like they finished
about the same time so the browser
speeds aren't too different from the two
phones I'll say that the 1s definitely
has an advantage you know by a few
seconds or so this little one more site
let's go to phone dog comm so phone dog
calm and phone dog calm
all right and we'll hit enter at the
same time so one two three and they're
both still loading so there's a lot of
content on this site and I'll let you
know as soon as one finishes all right
in this case the Galaxy Nexus actually
finished a little bit before the 1s so
really I mean the two browsers seem to
be somewhat equal you know you pick up
either these phones you're gonna get
great browsing performance
I'll hit home at the same time again you
can see the screen pops up faster the
home screen possible a lot faster on the
1s than it does in the Galaxy Nexus but
pretty much those are the results that
we have overall both are great fast
phones I have to give the slight edge to
the 1s loaded up faster as far as the
boot up time the cameras definitely
loads up faster all the apps seem to be
a little bit snappier however on the
Galaxy Nexus the Google Earth app and
the GPU seem to be a little bit superior
compared to the one especially
considering the fact that the Galaxy
Nexus has a higher resolution than does
the 1s and the browser's seem about
equal from what I've seen so overall the
winner is the 1s as expected but Galaxy
Nexus actually came a lot closer than I
thought it would but that's it for me
