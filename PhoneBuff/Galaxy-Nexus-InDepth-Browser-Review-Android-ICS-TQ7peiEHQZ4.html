buff calm and today I'm doing an
in-depth review of the browser in Ice
Cream Sandwich and therefore the Galaxy
Nexus so I'll go ahead and open up the
browser and you can see at the very top
you have your address bar and you have
to sort of button right here to look at
your tabs you can flick one off to close
it you can have up to 16 tabs on this
browser and within this page you have
our this window you have the option to
go to your bookmarks so you go to all
your bookmarks from there and back out
of that if you press this little button
right here with the three dots you'll be
given some options and then of course
you go to the settings so you can
refresh the page forward save the
bookmark share and find a pic find
what's on the page request a desktop
site and save for offline reading so if
you're going to be in an area with a
little to no reception and you're
reading a long article you could save it
for later go ahead and jump into the
settings and show you the ins and outs
so under general you can just set your
homepage and adjust your autofill
settings under accessibility you could
change the text scaling so you can make
it no larger like that or smaller this
really depends on what you want you
could also change the zoom one double
tap minimum font size and also invert
the rendering off that makes it easier
for you to see under privacy and
security you could do the usual you know
clearing of the history the cache
cookies location and passwords under
advanced you have the ability to set
your search engine so you can use yahoo
or bing nice to see google letting you
switch the search engine you could
select to open up tabs in the background
when you open a new tab javascript web
site settings blocking pop-ups and
things like that and then under
bandwidth management
you could choose whether or not images
are loaded up so if you just are
interested in the text if you're you
know want to read an article on the new
york times you could you know skip the
images all together and that saves you a
bit of bandwidth if you want to conserve
that and last but not least you have
labs and you have the option to browse
and full screen and enable quick
controls so you I'll show you a quick
controls it's actually pretty cool what
it lets you do is it lets you drag your
finger from the right in the middle of
the screen and you get this little
pop-up come up and off you can press
this to go to settings press this to go
to your address bar and you could go if
of course over here to go to your tabs
but when you do this you're not going to
have your normal sound scrolling up as
much as I can you know I can have your
address bar here and don't lay out so if
you do the quick controls you're given
up that so it might take a while to get
adjusted to but honestly it looks like
it's actually more efficient so I may
end up just using the quick controls
I'll go ahead and load up a web page
just so you guys can see how it renders
I'll load up let's say NFL com and it's
going to take me to the mobile site
first so I'm going to scroll down to the
bottom hit full website and just keep
you guys an idea of how fast this
renders on the Galaxy Nexus and how it
displays so it's done loading and I see
you have the full website and with this
high resolution screen this makes it
really nice because you could actually
you know make out the text not that
you'd read it at that size but you can
make it out the pinch resume is not
really choppy but it's not as smooth as
I would like to see it I've seen you
know phones like the galaxy s2 the
multi-touch is a lot smoother but I'm
sure they'll work that out in a update
coming up but that's pretty much it
that's the in-depth review of the
browser in Ice Cream Sandwich thank you
for watching the video and don't forget
to visit fumble calm for more cell phone
news reviews and how
to thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
