again with yet another fumble style
speed test this time with the Snapdragon
808 packing LG g4 against the octa-core
exynos Samsung Galaxy s6 but before we
get into the action I want to thank our
sponsors over at Full Sail University
for making this video possible
so with smartphone users accounting for
almost 2 billion people worldwide it's
clear that mobile is where it's at Full
Sail University's mobile development
bachelor's degree program teaches you
the skills you need to create develop
and market an app from start to finish
students are equipped with a macbook pro
industry software plus ios and android
devices they also offer an online mobile
gaming master's degree program allowing
you to expand on your programming skills
while learning to improve the mobile
game experience so if you're ready to
master the technology and the software
to compete in mobile click on that first
link down below in the description
alright let's get right into it all
right we'll start this thing off like we
always do by starting these stopwatches
on each phone and taking a picture right
out the gate the galaxy s6 jumps ahead
of the g4 with both phones racing
through the first row of system apps and
then moving on to the second row where
each phone will have to load more
processor intensive apps as they load up
Temple Run - looks like the galaxy s6
further separates itself from the g4
already moving on to smash hit but we're
only midway through the first lap of
this test so the g4 still has plenty of
time to close the gap especially in the
second round where the s6 has
historically struggled but for now the
Essex continues to increase his lead
over the g4 as both ones began
transcoding the same video file and as
you can see the s6 with its octa-core
exynos processor is transcoding the file
at a much faster rate than the g4 and a
Snapdragon 808 going from one up ahead
as it finishes up score mobile to a full
two apps ahead as it starts working on
18t comm with it finishing the
transcoding the g4 now moves on to score
mobile as the s6 finishes up the first
lap with an impressive time of one
minute into
seconds but this thing isn't over yet
with the g4 finishing the first lap with
a time of one minute and eight seconds
and the galaxy s6 having to reload
Temple Run 2 whereas the g4 under the
hand has it ready to go in the
background and going back in to smash it
it has that ready to go in the
background as well so the g4 takes the
lead over the s6 having pretty much
every app stored in RAM with the s6
having to reload every app and as a
result the g4 finishes first with the
time of 1 minute and 29 seconds with the
galaxy s6 still reloading the last few
apps and despite its 6 second lead from
the first lap it finishes 15 seconds
after the g4 with a total time of 1
minute and 44 so there you have it the
results here were similar to what we saw
in the m9 vs. s6 be test with the s6
being faster at initially loading apps
in the first lap but failing to keep all
those apps running in the background in
the second lap good news for the s6 is
despite being one hell of a fastball and
already it can be further optimized to
be even faster maybe even the fastest
with a future software update that
addresses the RAM allocation and up good
news for the g4 is that Snapdragon 808
ship actually did really well another
some concerns about LG opting to go with
the 808 over the 810 but looking at the
performance here it doesn't look to be
an issue at least when it comes to speed
anyways that is pretty much it for me in
this video thank you guys for watching
him as always I'll see you in the very
next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
