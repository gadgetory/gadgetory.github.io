calm and listen I'm going to show you
how to change your album art on your
Google music so I already did a video
before on how to change the album art on
your phone itself but this time it's for
the album art on the Google server so
that way when you access your Google
music whether it be from another
computer or another Android device
you're gonna be able to see the correct
album art so I'm just gonna edit one of
these albums for example I'll do all
about you by Jeremiah so I'm just gonna
click on the album itself and then right
here underneath the album artwork you
have a little arrow you can tap on it
and it gives you a drop-down menu from
here hit edit album info and this is
where you could actually edit all the
meta details but for the purpose of this
video just going to do change under the
album art and it asked us to browser a
computer for a picture we want to
replace it with
so I already downloaded the album art
from album art org which is right over
here
I'm gonna tap open so it could upload
this album art to the Google music
server and I'm gonna hit update info to
finalize my changes and there you go you
see now I've changed my album art
successfully when I go to albums you can
see that it looks the way it's supposed
to so if you have just a few of your
albums that are off you can do it you
know individually just like that if you
want to select multiple songs at once
for example I'll just select a few songs
over here the way you do it is press and
hold the ctrl button on your keyboard
and just tap on a song or with you click
on a song with your mouse and then
holding the ctrl button click on on
other songs and you get select this is
as many as you want or if you want to
just change all of your album art like I
had in the beginning with a generic
album art that you know covers pretty
much all you music if you don't want to
go through the hassle of doing it all
one by one
press click on a song at the very top
and scroll to the very bottom hold the
shift key on your keyboard and then hit
the last long and you can see it
highlights all of my songs now all
you're gonna do is hit this more button
right over here and then hit edit song
info' click on this guy and then don't
mess with anything over here because it
might mess up your whole music
collection this hit change right over
here underneath the album art like we
did before it
Brow's and I'm not going to choose a
little Google music icon right over here
i'ma hit open upload this guy and then
I'm just gonna hit update info that's
all I'm doing
it's gonna update all of my albums I'll
go to albums and now you can see all of
it has been synced up to have the new
album art reflected so that's pretty
much it on how you do it's pretty simple
just wanted to share that with you guys
I found it helpful please hit the like
button and also subscribe to the channel
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
