official LG recently took the wraps off
of their latest flagship and pen there
are some pretty interesting new features
that make the g5 unlike any other
smartphone I've ever seen in this video
we're going to take a look at the top
five best new features the g5 has to
offer
one design historically LG has stuck
with plastic designs under G Series in
order to accommodate for things like a
removable battery and a microSD slot but
this year
LG decided to ditch the plastic and went
with a full metal unibody design instead
the metal casing wraps all the way
around the back of the phone where it
seamlessly meets the slightly rounded 3d
art class in the front it has chamfered
edges which should make the phone a bit
easier to grip and unlike a lot of the
other metal phones out there the g5
doesn't have those ugly antenna lines
the other major design change is the
move away from LG's trademark rear
buttons as the g5 volume keys have
returned to the side of the phone with
only a power button slash fingerprint
scanner remaining on the back the phone
will be available in four different
color options in silver gold pink and a
grayish color LG is calling Titan so
overall that gbox design looks like a
pretty solid upgrade over the g4 s but a
metal build isn't necessarily exciting
plenty of phones have metal designs
nowadays and to be honest LG is kind of
late to the party but what is exciting
is the fact that LG was able to pull off
this metal design without having to
sacrifice the removable battery whoa
hello wizard to magic slot on the g5 you
can simply press a button in slide the
battery out from the bottom of the phone
and replace it with a fresh one in a few
seconds now that alone is impressive in
its own right but LG didn't stop there
instead of settling with just a
removable battery which by the way most
manufacturers don't even offer anymore
they've opened the door to a whole new
world of opportunities with the ability
to connect peripherals or what LG is
calling friends using the removable slot
LG introduced a camera grip with an
extended battery pack as well as a hi-fi
DAC audio player along with g5 which
both transform the phone into something
else entirely the g5 is the first major
phone to have a modular type design
and who knows what other peripherals LG
or other companies will come up with to
make the g5 even more capable over time
this is seriously one of the most
innovative features I've seen on a
smartphone in a long time and I can't
wait to see what comes out of it and
while the camera grip and the hi-fi
player are cool I think there's a lot
more this modular type design can bring
to the table 3
performance the g4 held its own in our
phone book style speedtest edging out
phones like the galaxy s6 with a
superior Ram management so with the
Snapdragon 820 under the hood along with
4 gigabytes of RAM the g5 looks to be a
serious contender in 2016
LG has streamlined the UI removing a lot
of the bloatware and unpopular features
like qslide which should result in a
faster phone so I'm excited to see what
this thing can do and how it fares
against the competition in our upcoming
speed tests for display it's not often
that you see a smart phone manufacturer
make the screen smaller on their new
flagship but that's exactly what LG did
this year dropping the screen size from
5.5 inches on the g4 to 5.3 inches on
the g5 the smaller screen results in the
quad HD IPS quantum display having a
higher pixel density on the g5 than it
did on the g4 and should also make for
easier one-handed use the other big
change with the screen is the new
always-on display which will always show
you the time the date and any missed
notifications you may have when the
phone is on standby LG says this
convenient feature won't negatively
impact battery life too much whether
using just under 1% of battery life per
hour
and considering that we check our phones
on average over a hundred and fifty
times a day many of those times just to
see what time it is or if we have any
missed notifications this new feature
may actually end up saving battery life
for some people five dual cameras on the
back of the g5 you have not one but two
camera sensors one of them is your main
78 degree angles 16 megapixel camera
with an f-stop of 1.8 similar to that on
the g4 while the other is a ultra wide
135 degree angle eight megapixel camera
that lets you capture more of what is in
front of you without having to take a
step back the camera software lets you
easily go back and forth between the two
camera modes
what you need at the time and also
includes some fun photo modes that take
pictures with both cameras for different
visual effects but these dual cameras
aren't just for the gimmicky photo
effects that stuff is just for fun what
these dual cameras really bring to the
table is the ability to capture more
than what your eyes can see with the
ultra wide lens so you can fit in a
bunch of people in a group photo or
maybe get a better shot of landscapes
without having to take a step back LG
has always had great cameras with g4
being one of the best camera phones out
on the market so this dual camera setup
is more than just a marketing gimmick
like we've seen other handsets do before
so those are the top five features on
the LG g5 of course there will be a
bunch of coverage coming to the channel
once we get our hands on the device so
be sure to subscribe and enable those
channel notifications so you don't miss
out on any of our new videos thank you
guys for watching and as always I'll see
you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
