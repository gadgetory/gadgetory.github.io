fan as a lot of you guys may already
know about me i tend to prefer the stock
or nexus experience over just about any
other third party UI on android but the
thing is even though I prefer the
overall experience you get on a phone
like the Nexus 5 there are some features
both big and small that I really do end
up missing when I switch over from a
phone running either Samsung's TouchWiz
HTC Sense and of course other operating
systems like iOS 7 and Windows Phone so
in this video we'll be going over five
features that are already out there and
already exists on other phones that I'd
really really like to see make their way
to stock Android to make that nexus
experience and as a result the
experience on all other Android phones
even better than what it is today
starting with number one which is an
improved app manager that actually
allows you to manage app permissions
instead of just showing you a list of
the permissions an app already has so
the way it is right now on Android when
you download an app say a calculator for
example and you see that as requesting
some weird permission like access to
your location which a calculator clearly
doesn't need you only really have two
options one is just to accept the fact
that the calculator wants access to your
location and go on with it and the other
is to stop using the app and delete it
off of your phone now obviously neither
of these options is ideal but if the app
manager to work on Android like it does
on iOS 7 where you can simply turn off
access to a certain permission like
location but still be able to use the
app the problem would be solved and
Android would be much more secure as a
result now the good news is Google has
actually been working on something like
this called a pops which was hidden in
the code in Android 4.3 but the bad news
and unfortunately there is bad news for
whatever reason this feature was removed
from the code in android 4.4 so there's
no telling if Google ever plans on
adding it back but hopefully they
removed it only because a Pop's wasn't
ready and not because they changed their
minds the second feature I'd like to see
make its way into stock Android is
always on active listening from
now while google technically already
added active listening to the stock
Android homescreen it only works when
the devices screen is on and unlocked
whereas on a phone like the Moto X it
works regardless of whether or not your
screen is on and it even works if you're
in the middle of an app making it a lot
more convenient and practical to use
seriously this is the number one thing
that I miss the most when I switch over
for my Moto X and with all the things
that Google now can do which I made a
video about that I'll link right below
being able to access it without ever
having to physically touch your phone
just makes sense so Google if you can
somehow add this into stock Android and
give all manufacturers the options to
support it with these specialized
hardware it may need you make one of
androids best features all that much
better and I guarantee you it'll be
something that people will consider when
choosing their next smartphone the third
feature I want to see in stock Android
is one that's been needed for a really
long time now in a better overall camera
app now we've already seen an update in
KitKat where Google improved its auto
focus and image quality on the Nexus 5
through software which is a good start
but I think Google needs to take it one
step further with features like burst
shot and maybe even slow motion to make
Android stock camera app more
competitive against not only third-party
you wise but more importantly against
other operating systems like iOS 7 and
the good news is this is a step that I
actually do expect Google to take
because some of the code for things like
burst shot are already built into KitKat
poor hdr+ and on top of that a Google
spokesperson came out and said that both
birdshot and raw image support would be
coming to developers soon so clearly
Google's been focusing on the camera app
and hopefully sooner or later it'll be
at least equal to or maybe even greater
than some of the camera apps on
third-party eyes and other os's
the fourth features that I think would
really take Android to the next level is
not really a big one and might not even
be something that you knew other phones
had an automatic video compression so
right now on Android if I record a video
of my cute little nephew and I want to
send it to my dad 9 out of 10 times
unless the video is super short I get
hit with an error message telling me
that the file size is over the 25
megabyte limit which isn't really
androids fault because that's the limit
that the email
of set which is the same thing on iOS
but the difference is on I was instead
of getting an error message that the
file size is too big you get a message
saying that the video is being
compressed to a smaller size afterwards
the video was automatically sent now
there are some workarounds available on
Android like absolute compress videos to
a smaller size or cloud services like
Dropbox but those solutions are nowhere
near as seamless and require a whole
bunch more effort in time so adding
automatic video compression to stock
Android is so they could really make not
only stock android better but just about
any other Android experience better as
well
so the fifth and at least for this video
final feature that I like to see
integrated into stock Android has to do
with multitasking so for a long time now
Android has been known as the superior
multitasker among the mobile operating
systems and while the other OSS have
improved their multitasking abilities
you can still make the argument that
Android is the best at doing it but
there should be enough for Google and
they should really try to take their
multitasking to the next level by adding
their own version of multi window where
you can use multiple apps on the screen
at the same time like on samsung's
touchwiz but they should do it in a way
where any app you want can be used in
split-screen instead of just a few or at
the very least make it really easy for
developers to update their apps to
support it now this feature would be
really cool on a smartphone and I think
it would add to the experience but where
it really shine is on a tablet where you
have a bunch of screen real estate to
actually use two apps at the same time
and consider that some windows tablets
have split-screen multitasking already I
think this is actually a feature that
Google knees dad so make sure that
Android stays competitive in the tablet
space so there you have it those are my
top five features that I think stock
Android is currently missing in
I think if Google could add at least
some of these features into the next
version of Android not only will stock
Android in us next is yours benefit but
Android as a whole will too since
TouchWiz sense and all those other
third-party eyes are based off of stock
Android so these top five features can
very well make their way into those new
eyes if they're not there already
