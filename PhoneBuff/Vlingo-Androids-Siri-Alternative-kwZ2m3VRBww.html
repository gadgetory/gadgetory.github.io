calm and today I'm gonna be doing a
video review on the apt lingo available
from the Android Market
with the new iPhone 4s just around the
corner a lot of people are getting
really excited about arguably the iPhone
4s best feature which is Siri now a lot
of Android loyalists have been kind of
downplaying series saying that voice
command isn't anything new and that
androids had it for a long time now well
that's true
Siri is something new basically series
more of a virtual assistant and what
Android has is just regular voice
command that's what Vlingo comes in it's
basically the alternative to Siri if you
want to stick with Android with the
lingo you could do things like have it
find you a taxi or a restaurant nearby
of a certain type even opening up an app
for you or you could ask it a question
and I'll answer it right within the app
so I'll go ahead and show you some of
these features that Vlingo has I have to
say we're out the bat that lingo isn't
quite as good as serious but it is
pretty close and it's the best
alternative that Android currently has
alright so when you look at the app
itself you can see a from its main
screen all the different commands you
can give it so I'll go ahead and cover
the ones that aren't already available
on the stock Android voice command so
I'll go to the home screen I've
programmed this little search key to
launch Vlingo when I press and hold it
so I'll ask it to open up a application
for me open calendar and you can see it
opened up my calendar it didn't I don't
have to repeat myself it's really
accurate with the voice ask it about the
weather I guess weather in Laguna Hills
now it does use your GPS so it's able to
realize that I'm talking about Laguna
Hills in California by using my GPS I
don't have to be you know exactly a hike
ragged I think I could just say weather
alone and
it opens up google weather and uh you
know I've got my five-day forecast right
there all right so let's ask it a
question
when was Martin Luther King born and
you'll see that the that Vlingo will
actually answer your question right
within the app so january 15 1929 let's
do a restaurant i guess i'll ask it to
find me a italian restaurant
italian restaurants nearby and you can
see it's searching for italian
restaurants that are nearby and their UI
was populated with a few restaurants so
if i want to go to Olive Garden I could
just call right there and even you know
see the reviews if I'm not familiar with
the restaurant now I'm gonna actually do
something I said I wouldn't but I'll
text with lingo I'll text somebody
versus texting with the stock Android
voice command just so you guys can kind
of see the difference so text alex green
what are you doing so you can see Alex
green what are you doing I just hit Send
and I'd be done so I'll go to the stock
Android voice come in and show you guys
a difference text alex green what are
you doing today
now you kind of see the accuracy I mean
it said all of green what are you doing
today so it got most of it right but it
didn't get the most important part right
which is sending the message to Alex
Green and they send it in the message so
it did even put it in the to field so
you kind of see the difference lingos
definitely a lot better than Android
stock voice command and it's pretty
close to Siri I'd recommend you guys
download the app it's free from the
Android Market it's supported by ads you
could get an ad-free version too
I'm not sure how much that cost but you
can find the full details at foam buff
