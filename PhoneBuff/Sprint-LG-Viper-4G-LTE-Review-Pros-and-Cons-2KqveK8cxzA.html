calm and this video we're doing a review
on the sprint LG Viper 4G LTE and like I
do with all my reviews I'm we're doing a
quick harder tour and then getting right
into the review so on the front of
device you have a four inch going to a
jingly IPS display that's 800 by 480 in
resolution on the top right you have a
VGA front-facing camera got your
earpiece and normal sensors on the
bottom you have four capacitive touch
buttons for a home menu back and search
I succeed they don't stay on for that
long but hopefully that gives you an
idea what it looks like on the right
side you have absolutely nothing on the
left you have your volume rocker for
volume up and down and your micro USB
charging port right here
on the top of the device you have your
3.5 mm headset jack secondary mic and
power button on the back you have your
five megapixel camera capable of 1080p
video capture and your LED flash got
your LG logo right here and at the very
bottom you have your speaker grille and
at the bottom of the device itself you
have nothing but a little slot where you
can put in your fingernail to pop off
the back so I'll go ahead and do that on
the inside of device you have a 1.2
gigahertz Snapdragon s3 dual-core
processor with one gigabyte of RAM you
have four gigabytes of internal storage
expandable by this micro use or microSD
slot which comes with a four gig where
you can expand it up to 32 of course the
battery in here is 1700 milliamps of
course you have NFC so you can see you
know you have this on the back cover and
again it's a 4G LTE phone but that
pretty much wraps up the hardware tour
I'll go ahead and get right into the
review itself talking about what I like
and also what I dislike about the phone
I'll start off with what I dislike so
that way I can end this review on a
positive note which I do on most my
reviews alright so one of the first
things I have to say I disliked about
the LG Viper is a screen on this guy not
necessarily the screen size at 4 inches
or the screen type which is an IPS
display but the screen resolution at 800
by 480 being a 4G LTE phone I just kind
of expected something along lines of
like qHD because you know with faster
data speeds you want to be able to take
advantage of that with the higher
quality YouTube videos and
web browsing but it's not that big of an
issue because like I said it is an IPS
display and if I could give you a
close-up you can see the quality is
actually pretty good on here the IPS
display does a good job at color
reproduction and you know it just kind
of makes up for the lower resolution so
it's a minor issue for me but sometimes
a bigger issue and I think it'll be a
bigger issue for most of you guys at
least everyone I've shown you know has
mentioned something about it and that's
the thickness of the device
I almost happen inch-thick 0.46 inches
to be exact it's a pretty thick bone I
mean compared to the Samsung Galaxy
Nexus which is also available on Sprint
you can tell the thickness you know it's
a lot more on the LG than it is on the
Samsung and this is a bigger device so
you'd expect this to be thicker but this
guy isn't in also this guy is heavier
too it's five ounces or 142 grams so
it's a heavier you know thicker foam
when really you know with just a 4-inch
screen you expect to be lighter and
thinner but anyway that's another issue
that I have and the last issue or the
last problem that I have with the LG
Viper is the battery life battery life
seems to be you know pretty bad I mean
it runs out you know but the end of the
day I'm pretty much either charged it
throughout the day and that's not even
when I'm connected to 4G LTE I don't
know if it's trying to catch on to a 4G
LTE network or what's going on but you
know from compared to my Galaxy Nexus my
iPhone 4s my Samsung Galaxy Note you
know this one
doesn't last as long with this seventeen
hundred million battery but the good
news is that's pretty much all I dislike
about the LG Vibram you get past the
thickness and the weight and things like
that you know it's not all that bad of
device so what that says go ahead and
talk about some of the things that I
actually like what the LG Viper compared
to other mid-range handsets out there
all right so let's talk about what I
like about the phone and the first thing
that I like what the Viper is a soft
right here now I'm not talking about the
fact that you know it's running Android
2.3 point 7 obviously I'd much rather
seen I just couldn't stand which loaded
on this guy and LG did say they're gonna
be releasing
I shouldn't stand much for this guy
sooner or later of course we don't have
a timetable but what I'm talking about
as far as the software it goes is the
fact that it's pretty much stock Android
there's no custom UI by LG you know
taking up extra system resources and I
feel like you know having this stock
experience on here not only you know do
I prefer it but you know it's personal
preference but also if you like it
you know attributes to the phone
performing a little bit faster than it
would otherwise because you know there's
nothing running in the background as far
as the UI goes and it's just pretty
quick I mean everything I opened up is
pretty fast obviously some of these apps
are open up in the background see if I
can open up one that I haven't opened up
a little do uh does this do YouTube so
tap YouTube and I mean you can see it is
pretty quick even then obviously it's
not just a software that makes it fast
it's the snapdragon s3 dual-core
processor underneath the hood that makes
the fast as well and that's go ahead and
run a quadrant benchmark test so we
could see exactly how fast this guy
performs compared to the other devices
out there so I'll go and run the
benchmark and as soon as the benchmark
is done I'll unpause the video because I
don't want to bore you with it going
through its steps so anyway I'll go
ahead and pause the video and come right
back as soon as it's done alright so the
benchmark test is done I'm going to hit
yes and let's see if we give the score
so the device scored a 3067 so
definitely a good benchmark score
similar to what you get on the Galaxy s2
on you know of t-mobile or ATT where
they're using the Snapdragon s4
processor so definitely you know pretty
good considering this is only a
mid-range phone you know I'd $100 that's
definitely a good value as for our speed
goes some of the other things that I
like about the device or the fact that
it has NFC and comes pre-loaded with
Google Wallet same thing is you know the
next success and obviously the benefit
of it is not only being able to use it
but I also feel like it kind of feature
proofs your phone because NFC obviously
is a technology that's gonna get more
more popular as time goes on and the
fact that this guy has it you know is
gonna make you feel or your phone feel
outdated and also speaking of you know
not feeling outdated the fact that has
4G LTE you're gonna be able to run on
Sprint's fastest internet connection as
soon as they roll it out in your area
obviously in my area in Irvine
California
they still haven't rolled it out so I'm
still in 3G on this guy but anyways you
know say in a year down the line they
actually roll it out you'll be able to
have you know both NFC you'll have 4G
LTE and like I said you'll have the
stock Android experience hopefully they
keep the stock Android when they update
it to Android 4.0 but you know that's my
review pretty much you know the pros and
cons about the cons are the screens
resolution isn't
like you know the thickness of devices
you know a lot larger a lot more than
you you'd want and also the battery life
isn't necessarily the best but the pros
of the device are the fact that you know
it's a stock Android experience or
closest to it you have a you know fast
performance on here you have 4G LTE and
you have NFC but anyway that's my review
