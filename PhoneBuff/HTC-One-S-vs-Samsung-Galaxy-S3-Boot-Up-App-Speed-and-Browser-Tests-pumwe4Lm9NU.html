comm in this premiere doing a speed
compares test between the HTC one s here
on the left against the samsung galaxy
s3 here on the right so we're going to
get started off first test will be the
boot up test obviously I have both you
guys turned off I'm just gonna press and
hold the power button at the same time
so one two three i'ma hold it for about
three seconds and then let go alright so
that should be good enough and I will go
ahead and let these guys boot up see
which one actually turns on first while
they're loading up i'll let you guys
know that they're both actually running
on the same Wi-Fi network and also the
browsing history and cache has been
cleared out on both browsers so we'll be
nice and even I in the browsing speed
test also be loading up a couple of
applications to see you know what kind
loads up first this will give you a
general idea as far as the experience
you will receive from each device so
worth noting that both these guys
actually had the same processor so you
see the galaxy s3 actually finished up
first main difference between the
hardware is the running both are the
same process which is the Snapdragon s4
but this guy only has one gigabyte of
RAM compared to the two keywords found
on the galaxy s3 so you can see the boot
up test obviously the galaxy s3 one you
know it's been done for quite some time
now and you know I've been able to get
into the phone and load things around
the HTC One S is still doing its thing
there you go looks like it's almost done
there you go ahead and unlock this guy
now you see it's still loading up HTC
Sense so gives you a little bit of an
idea as far as the boot up time goes but
it's go ahead and start the application
load speed test so we'll go ahead and
load up for the first application will
do scorecenter i'm just going to wait a
couple of seconds because i want to make
sure that this guy actually finishes up
loading everything so all right that
should be good enough let's go ahead and
start up scorecenter so one two three
and there you go you see that the galaxy
s3 loaded up followed by the HTC One S
and there you go so we'll go ahead and
hit home now I'm not going to close
these guys out out of the background
because I really want to show you you
know the hardware difference here
they're both running Android so no need
to close them out on the background and
I mean honestly most of time we're not
closing our apps you know all the time
anyway so really want to show you the
experience will receive from both phones
and obviously this one's going to
edge with an extra gig of ram let's go
to Oprah flixster so one two three and
again you see the splash screen first on
the Galaxie studios that one's pretty
close but obviously this guy was maybe a
second ahead of the 1s so we'll go ahead
and back out so so far the gal
accessories winning in the HP test let's
go ahead and load up another one let's
load up Temple Run so one two three and
there you go you can see it's just maybe
a second ahead of the HTC One S so
really I mean not that big of a
difference here so let's go ahead and
close these guys out or should I say
minimize these guys let's go ahead and
try another application will do uh well
do google earth or actually just do ya
school or so let me find Googlers i
think i made a shortcut for it here yeah
Google Earth and Google or so i'll go
ahead and tap on at the same time one
two three and again you can see pretty
much the difference seems to be a second
not sure if that has to do the RAM
difference or more or less maybe just
Samsung's optimizations pretty much same
thing let's go ahead and zoom in on Las
Vegas so type in Las Vegas really quick
Los Vegas basically I just want to you
know kind of zoom in on the city just to
show you you know how smooth each one is
so we'll go ahead and double tap on here
double tap double tap again all right
and same thing here double tap double
tap you know actually this look at the
same hotel and make it a little easier
let's look at the stratosphere I'm both
so let's zoom out a little where is it
shadows for your stress right there it
is alright so this guy is loaded it up
you can see the new google earth here
too but house wanna zoom in his mouth so
while that one is loading or i don't
anything it registered but i'm gonna go
ahead and push this guy out of the way
and quickly zoom in and zoom out i'm
just going to show you know how smooth
are you know stuff laggy it is
so you can see there is a little bit of
choppiness up with this phone I'm trying
to you know zoom in and moving around is
kind of choppy but isn't all that bad go
ahead and do a 3d spin of the
stratosphere and you can see I mean it's
it's not bad but it is pretty choppy I'd
have to say let's go ahead and show the
galaxy s3 now so for some reason it just
didn't register that I wanted the
stratosphere so let's try that again
alright so i went ahead and typed in the
stratosphere because for some reason
this little thing wasn't working so
anyway we'll go ahead and zoom in on it
and i will do the same sort of test
basically zooming in and i don't know
about you guys but I feel like this
one's a lot smoother than it was on the
HTC One S let's go ahead and try the
same test as far as doing that little
360 view so let me try to get in the
same angles that earlier so 360 view not
obviously the smoothest but it is
smoother than the 1s I really do feel
that way you know zooming in and out
seems to be a little bit faster panning
around seems to be a little bit better I
mean not that big of a difference Square
to show you this one more time so
actually is do both at the same time so
yeah it's good to see come on all right
so yes see I mean it's not really
responding to my multi-touch I'm trying
to pinch to zoom and its really skipping
on me we're on this guy you know it's
still skipping but just not as much so I
mean just take that for what it's worth
any we'll go ahead and back out of here
now let's go and do the browser test
actually no I'm do a quick quadrant
standard and on both moan so loud you
guys could see the scores on both and i
am going to actually close out the
applications here so i'm just going to
remove all i'm just going to do it this
way I know that sometimes it doesn't
close out all the applications but
should be good enough when we did the
same on both phone so let's go ahead and
load up quadrant standard quadrant
standard and I'll run the benchmark
outages fast forward through the actual
process la VES que get right to the
score
alright so both these guys are done is
go ahead and yet yes on both and I will
show you the score on the HC 1 s so this
time I got a 4420 and on the galaxy s3 I
got a whoops got a 4893 so on both
devices I didn't really get as high of a
score as I usually do but I'm galaxy s3
is higher and you know typically I am
getting higher scores in the galaxy s3
so that's that and that seems do you
know pretty much go online with the
performance that we've gone thus far
let's go ahead and start the browser
test so load up both browsers and off
let's load up a couple of sites so
actually got a forgot I loaded this
really quick so i'll go ahead and clear
out the history really quick on this guy
alright so let's go ahead and load up
bomble com on both phones
I saw a go at the same time so one two
three remember the both wearing the same
Wi-Fi network so we should you know see
a nice even test here look like so far
the galaxy oh there you go so that one
looked like they finished about the same
time I'm it look like the galaxy trio is
a head first and then also the HTC one
is caught up let's go ahead and try
another site because that one was too
close to call I should just going to
load up an article really quick over
here so let's just load up this will do
this ESPN article that I did a while ago
so tap at the same time so one two three
so the content data is done so this time
the galaxy s3 one look like the HTC One
S was actually showing the content a
little bit before the galaxy s3 was but
the galaxy s3 you know catches up and
actually beats it let's go to another
site which is NFL com basically my
favorite my second favorite website so
nfl.com what am i doing there you go NFL
com and n-f-l com so one two three load
it up just a little bit faster on the
galaxy s3s go to the bottom and load up
the desktop version so one two three
and again the galaxy s3 is done and now
the HTC One S is done so as you can see
the galaxy s3 seems to be about just a
second or two thousand it's not that big
a difference but keep in mind that this
guy does have an extra gigabyte of RAM
so when you have all these apps up are
open in the background is that we're
going to make a difference out in those
situations and you know if I were to
open up a whole bunch of apps on both
phones I'm sure that the galaxy s3 would
actually you know load up up the next
step a little bit faster than what the
HTC One S but either way you're going to
get a nice no fast performing phone
honestly I feel like samsung's UI is a
little bit faster than HTC but I like
HTC's looks a little better so really
you know comes down to personal
preference but anyway that's it from
being this bitter found it helpful
