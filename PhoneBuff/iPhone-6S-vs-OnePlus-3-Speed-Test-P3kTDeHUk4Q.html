test the 1+3 defeated the Exynos bearing
of the galaxy s7 taking the crown as the
new Android speed test champ
but today it faces up against the foam
of styles betta champ the iPhone success
well dethrone Apple's latest flagship or
will the iPhone remain the fastest
smartphone in the world let's find out
alright so right off the bat t1 plus 3
takes the lead over the iPhone success
with its super quick animations already
finishing up the first roll of system
apps and moving on to the gaming rail
loading up subway surfers but the iPhone
success is right there behind it looking
to make a comeback which it does taking
the lead and moving on to true skate
meanwhile d1 plus 3 is still working on
subway surfers and finishes at about the
same time the iPhone 6s finishes true
skate so the one plus three is one app
behind but remember we're only halfway
through this first lap with the second
lap still remaining worthy one plus
three and it's 6 gigabytes of RAM has
proven to be effective so the one plus
three is trying to cut into the iPhones
lead but the iPhone is not letting up as
it moves on to lab set where both phones
will create a time-lapse from the same
exact video file so this may be where
either the iPhone further separates
itself from the 1 + 3 or the one plus 3
is able to cut into the iPhones lead but
from the looks of it it seems that the
iPhone is processing the time-lapse at a
much faster rate than the 1 plus 3 with
it starting off about 40 frames ahead of
the 1 + 3 and finishing almost 70 frames
ahead so the 1 + 3 has this work cut out
for it with the iPhone being 2 apps
wait no makes ahead three apps ahead in
this first lab ok so the 1 + 3 is
finally done with lapses as the iPhone
finishes up with the last leg of the
first lap in loading up a new web
website parking in a time of 1 minute
and 20 seconds so for the 1 + 3 to have
any real shot I'm making a comeback here
it's going to be the iPhone success with
its 2 gigabytes of RAM to stumble in the
second lap and not have a few the apps
open in the back
but unfortunately for the one puss that
doesn't look like it's going to happen
as the 1+3 finishes the first type or
the time of 1 minute and 32 seconds it's
going to need it's quick animations to
help it make up for lost ground and it
looks like it's doing just that with a
closing in on the iPhones lead but will
it be too little too late and yeah it
looks like it is with the iPhone 6s
dodging the oneplus has come back with a
total time of 1 minute and 54 seconds
with the 1 + finishing just 3 seconds
later at 1 minute and 57 seconds making
the winner and still fumble style
speedtest champ the iPhone 6s thank you
guys for watching it as always I'll see
you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
