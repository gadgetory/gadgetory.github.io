and in this will be doing it drop test
with the iPhone 5 against the Samsung
Galaxy s3 see which one is the most
durable after two you're doing three
different drop tests one from low height
which is about the waist one from the
mid height which is about the chest and
one from high up here around your head
so through the dropping wire on a phone
call for example so we'll go ahead and
start off with the iPhone 5 face down
which is pretty much worst-case scenario
we're dropping it on pretty much asphalt
over here so it's not gonna be bad if
you were to drop it indoors all right so
here's the iPhone 5 it looks like it
fared pretty well and this initial drop
says you know the screen still working
and if you look around not you know too
much noticeable damage only along the
left side basically right over here you
can see the scuff marks along the left
edge of the phone but not to best goal
let's go ahead and do the mid height
drop test
I still have been pretty well on that
low drop test to do the mid drop this
whoo that one definitely Rock the iPhone
screen as you guys can see looks pretty
bad I mean the screen is still working
but it definitely is cracked so they're
gonna do that well in that last drop but
everywhere else looks pretty good that
won't drop directly on the screen so you
guys can see the screen still working
but it's cracked on this right top edge
let's go ahead and do the high drop test
all right um the screen is a little bit
nice but the display is still working
we'll drop it right over here so one two
three
and we got some more damage now so this
time if you look along the left edge you
can see you got another crack it's kind
of peeling off you know I feel if I rub
my finger hard on it I might cut myself
but screen is still working so in the
back is perfectly fine so let's go ahead
and check out the Galaxy s3
and you can see it doesn't look that bad
but I'm not sure if that's coming
through on camera there is a little
crack through the display you can see at
the top left corner our top right corner
should I say it's a little bit cracked
but everything still works and you can
see it's still working fine everywhere
else on the phone is pretty much free of
any damage so we'll go ahead and do the
mid drop test and you can see completely
shattered I'm not sure if the screen is
working yeah I can't get the display to
turn on right now so the hot one looks
pretty bad not turning on pretty much at
this point it's not usable drop straight
on the screen you see the edges you know
are still pretty good you know the back
looks fine but display completely
shattered but just for the heck of it
let's go ahead and see what happens if
we drop it from you know my head alright
so the screen is completely shattered
we'll go ahead and drop it from here and
see what happens
all right so the battery cover pops out
and uh just more of the same we got the
screen being even more shattered this
time around bones not even I'm gonna
displace not even turning on so I can't
itself the phones working on I'm
president holding the power button it's
not responding so obviously out of the
two we actually look at the two phones
you can see that the galaxy s3 did end
up being the loser here the iPhone five
prevails because it's still working I
mean I can still use it not that I
really want you know a brand new iPhone
to be cracked but it's still working but
I needed to call somebody I could get
the job done
this guy's display is completely shot
it's out and there's pretty much nothing
we can do about it other than getting a
replacement but that's pretty much it
