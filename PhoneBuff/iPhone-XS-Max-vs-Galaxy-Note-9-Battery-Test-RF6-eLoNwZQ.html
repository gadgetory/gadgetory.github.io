is a special one because in today's
video for the first time ever we're in
billing the bumble of style battery test
now this is a test that we've been
working on and developing for close to a
year now
and it's actually something that you
guys have been asking for since all the
way back when we announced the bumble
style drop test in 2015 so thumbs up if
you guys are excited for this video like
I am and up thumbs up if you guys want
to see more of these battery tests in
the future but for now I can't think of
a better way to kick things off then
with the mashup that we have today and
the big boys from both Apple and Samsung
going head-to-head taking a look at the
spec sheets dye phone tennis max has a
6.5 inch display with a resolution of
2688 by 12 42 and it's running on
Apple's news 7 nanometre 812 Bionic chip
powered by 8 3100 74 million power
battery the note 9 on the other hand has
a 6 point 4 inch display running at the
default 1080p resolution since that's
what the majority of people are gonna be
using it at anyways and it's powered by
the 10 nanometer Qualcomm Snapdragon 845
to go along with its whopping 4 thousand
milliamp hour battery so the question is
will Apple's more efficient 7 nanometre
chip along with iOS as optimizations be
enough to outlast the note 9 or whether
the note 9s is four thousand milliamp
hour battery will be just too much for
the iPhone to handle let's find out
all right so for this first test we're
jumping into the phone app where we'll
be making a one-hour call on each phone
using the same exact SIM card in the
same exact location we have our robot
covering the proximity sensor for the
majority of the test with it only
pulling off every 30 seconds to check on
the call status it's important to note
here that we do have consistent audio
playing on the other end of the call
that way the earpieces are actually
being put to work like they would be
during a normal conversation we'll go
ahead and speed through to the end of
the call we're after one hour both
phones hold up pretty nicely with the
iPhone 10's max dropping to 97% and the
note 9 falling slightly behind it at 95%
so let's see if the iPhone can maintain
its lead as we head into the second test
where we're simulating a real-world text
messaging conversation a robot is typing
in a string of letters and suggestions
on each phone with the same set of
responses from our chat bot coming back
from the other end one thing worth
mentioning is that we've calibrated the
brightness on each phone to 200 nits to
make sure that things are nice and fair
whereas setting the brightness levels to
their maximum would only penalize a
phone that's capable of getting brighter
which obviously wouldn't make much sense
after one hour of going back and forth
with text messages the results are
actually the opposite of what we saw in
the first test with note 9 pulling ahead
with this battery at 86% compared to the
iPhones which fell down to 84 percent
but it's still a close one so let's move
on to the email test where we're opening
the same set of emails on each phone and
scrolling through each one of these open
emails a few times before returning to
the inbox and repeating the task the
email apps on each phone are fresh so
each email is being loaded for the first
time to best simulate how you read
emails in real life after one hour the
no nines battery level is at 78%
increasing its lead over the iPhone
which saw its battery level fall down to
71% so just three tests in and we have a
pretty significant difference the note 9
is 7% ahead as we enter the browser test
where each phone will randomly cycle
through the same set
of 100 websites every 30 seconds we're
also scrolling through these webpages to
better simulate how you browse the web
we're after the one-hour browsing
session the no 9 is able to improve on
its lead with it now 13% ahead of the
iPhone at 68% compared to just 55 we'll
see if the iPhone can turn things around
as we move on to Instagram where we're
not just sitting on one page but
actually scrolling through the feed like
you would in real life which is
important in a battery test as touch
input does have an effect on battery
life
since every time you touch the screen
the phone technically has to process
that touch one hour of scrolling down
the feed later and that the iPhone took
a major hit to its battery falling a
whopping 18% in this test compared to
the note lines relatively moderate 9
percent drop in battery so things just
aren't looking good for the iPhone as we
enter the YouTube test where we'll be
watching the same set of videos on each
phone it's important to note that in
addition to having the screens
brightness equally calibrated we've also
calibrated the speakers to the same
decibel count to make sure that the
volume levels are the same and after one
hour of YouTube binge watching the note
9 continues to outperform the iPhone
10's max with this battery at 49%
compared to the iPhones 19% giving the
note 9 8:30 percentage point advantage
over the iPhone as we head into the
gaming test where we'll be playing Altos
adventure on each phone it'll be
interesting to see if the iPhone 7
nanometre 812 by ownership can make a
difference here but after one hour it
looks like it didn't really seem to
matter with the note 9 maintaining 38%
of its battery compared to just 1% left
on the iPhone so obviously we don't
expect the iPhone to last too much
longer with only 1% as we entered the
maps test where we're simulating
navigation by having GPS turned on
having the phones actively check for
real-time traffic information and
scrolling through the maps we're just
over 4 minutes into the test the iPhone
10's Max's battery is done with the
phone powering off while the note 9
still has 37 percent remaining so a big
difference here and in case you're
wondering yes we did make sure that the
iPhone was an app indexing during the
test
and we even ran this test twice and got
the same exact results so we'll go ahead
and move on to the end where after one
hour in maps the no nines battery Falls
to 28% after an hour in Spotify it drops
to 17% and then finally about 40 minutes
into the snapchat test the note nines
battery finally dies making the winner
by a huge margin the Galaxy Note 9
anyways that is it for me in this video
thank you guys for watching and as
always I'll see you in the very next
episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
