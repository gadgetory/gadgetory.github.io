haven't heard anything official from
Samsung on the galaxy s AIDS there have
been all sorts of rumors and leaks now
I'm doing air codes here because I feel
like more often than not things are
purposely leaked by manufacturers in
order to generate buzz for the upcoming
phones but purposefully leaked or not I
don't mind I'm excited I know a lot of
guys are excited about the Galaxy s8 so
with that said go ahead and jump right
into it so the first major rumor has to
do with the display in that it's getting
bigger rumor has it that the regular s7
will feature a 5.8 inch display and the
larger s8 will get a 6.2 inch display
both displays will feature dual curved
edges so Samsung will likely call the
larger s8 the s8 plus instead of the s8
edge since the smaller s8 will get the
edge display as well now I know a lot of
you may be thinking like WTF Samsung we
don't need bigger phones but the good
news is the phones themselves won't
actually be any bigger than the s7 and
this is because Samsung is moving the
fingerprint scanner from the front of
the phone to the back shrinking the
bezels around the screen and stretching
the screen itself up vertically but not
horizontally so the screen won't be much
wider but it will be taller giving it a
kind of weird 18 by 9 aspect ratio
compared to the normal 16 by 9 ratio we
see in most phones today now if these
please turn out to be legit some of that
extra screen real estate will obviously
be used for the new on-screen button
since there will be no room for physical
buttons on the front the taller screen
should also make things like
multitasking a little bit better so this
will be more room for two windows on the
screen at once so I'm cool with it and
it seems like it's going to be the trend
anyway going forward with LG doing the
same thing with the g6 as far as
resolution goes no the SI will most
likely not be getting a 4k display which
honestly doesn't really matter unless
you're trying to use it for VR but that
said the VR experience does look like
it'll get a little bit better but the S
eights new display rumored to dish the
penthouse sub pixel layout that Samsung
has been using in favor of the standard
RGB layout the difference between the
two is basically that the standard RGB
layout has individual sub pixels instead
of shared sub pixels like on the
pentaiah displays this means that there
will be more total pixels despite having
a similar resolution which should
translate into better looking VR so as I
mention
the fingerprint scanner is rumored to be
moving to the back of the phone to allow
for a thinner bezels and a bigger screen
and I don't have a problem with this
right like there's plenty of phones that
have fingerprint scanners on the back
like the pixel which I personally had no
issues with whatsoever but I will say if
the leaks turn out to be true the
placement of the fingerprint scanner is
kind of questionable because instead of
the scanner being like right where your
finger naturally rests like on the pixel
and the LGB 20 it's up and off to the
side next to the camera
so imagine that you had to reach up to
where the heart rate sensor is right now
on the s7 to unlock your phone now I
have bigger hands so like it's doable
for me but if you have smaller hands or
if you're left-handed this might
actually be an issue not to mention all
the accidental fingerprint smudges on
the camera but you know who knows maybe
it won't be that big of a deal and there
is rumors of the s8 will be getting the
iris scanner like we saw on the note 7
which may work even better and faster in
terms of performance the Galaxy s8
should be a pretty good jump over the
galaxy s7 with Samsung looking to launch
two different variants like they did
last year with one of them having their
own in-house external shipped and the
other having the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835
both chips will feature improvements in
both the CPU and GPU departments and
both will likely be coupled with four
gigabytes of RAM another big new feature
that's being rumor right now is
Samsung's all new digital assistant
named
Bixby that is set to debut on the galaxy
s 8 as you all know s voice which is
Samsung's current digital assistant but
just isn't all that great will be nice
but the new assistants will have the AI
from viv labs which is a company that
Samsung acquired last year which side
notes was actually founded by the same
guys behind Apple Siri
so in a few demos of is that I've seen
the assistant is capable of some pretty
impressive things unlike Siri and the
Google assistants you can give it more
complex requests for example you can ask
it like what the weather will be like in
Las Vegas after 7:00 p.m. next Thursday
and it will actually understand you and
give you the correct response like Syria
and now the Google assistance the
business iStent or Bixby is going to be
open to third-party developers with
visible apps having already integrated a
few things like being able to send money
to your friends using venmo
gifting your mom with flowers calling an
uber or
booking a hotel for you with everything
being done quickly and easily right
within the assistance UI and this is
just what viv lab showed to us before
Samsung acquired them last year so I'm
excited to see what progress they've
made since then and what exactly Samsung
has in store well big Steve show up on
other Samsung devices kind of like
Amazon's Alexa I wouldn't doubt it and
it'd be kind of cool to be able to ask
Bixby like what's inside your Samsung
fridges while you're at the grocery
store and yes that is a possibility but
probably not at first either way I
expect Samsung to make a really big deal
about big speeds so much so that some
rumors are suggesting that the Galaxy s8
will actually have a dedicated button
just for the digital assistant speaking
of acquisition Samsung also bought
Harman Kardon last year and some rumors
are suggesting that the SI will feature
dual stereo speakers powered by Harman
kind of like what HTC did back in the
day with Beats back when they owned a
majority share in the company there are
a few rumors that go against this though
saying that Samsung won't be integrating
Harman and Status aides but like Harman
branding or not I just hope that the
Galaxy sa get stereo speakers which is
something their biggest competitor and
Apple is already doing with the iPhone 7
but we'll see a few of the other things
you can expect on the s8 are basically
rollover features from the note 7 like
the iris scanner ambient light sensors
on the back and the front for better
auto brightness USB type-c and maybe
just maybe 64 gigabytes of internal
storage as base model instead of only 32
gigabytes which unfortunately if it's
true we'll probably also mean we'll see
a price bump but again just to reiterate
all of this is based off of rumors and
leaks and none of it is official until
Samsung unveils the Galaxy s8 in March
with a release date rumored to be
sometime in April anyways that is it for
me in this video you can bet that when
the s8 drops we putting it to the test
so subscribe if you haven't already
thank you guys for watching and as
always I'll see you in the very next
