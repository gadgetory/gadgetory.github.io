welcome back to another episode of a per
crap
when we find random apps and decide
whether or not they deserve a spot on
your phone and today's episode we're
going to look at the game called stack
created by ketchup
kachou qatar mustard mustard so have you
been keeping up with a series you know
that we like to play with a bit of a
twist and in this episode is no
different
using saltine crackers for every 10
pieces we stack in the game equals one
cracker for a pony to eat well Jay and I
will have two attempts at getting the
highest score that we can and whatever
that highest score is is the amount of
crackers the other player will have to
eat all at once at the end which if you
heard about the saltine cracker
challenge before you know that anything
above six crackers at once is
practically impossible so with that said
let's go ahead and get right into it
oh yeah experience takes dammit dammit
Oh Mike okay focus
stop messing with me dude alright I
can't get a rhythm yes
oh my god there you go
come on come on come on go on come on
yes yes 75 no all right so obviously
David one by one I'm gonna stack her
like whatever that means
how many eight crackers and he has to
eat seven seven I think the fact that we
got past six and it overall is this
gonna is gonna be horrible we can't
drink water yeah we can't drink water
where does he eat on camera as is and we
do like quickly right yeah basically
non-stop one by one and and we'll just
see how it goes Cheers no Cheers all
right
at one point one of the factors was it a
big chocolate wallet on the bottom what
slow Oh that'd be good
I don't you not deal with the Heimlich
or anything yeah I'm a certified give us
walk me dying camera huh got a lot of
use dude oh I saw when you spit it out
it looked like what is it you know well
the Bob James does that thing that's
what I look like it look like all right
so uh crackers aside crumbs aside what
do you think about the game um other
than this horrible challenge I think the
game itself is pretty good it's simple
it's it's pretty smart for what it is I
mean just the tips to the typical stat
game but the way they did is pretty cool
I like how the blocks chopped off as
well as they get bigger when you
actually complete the scale yeah so that
was a pretty cool touch I think I think
overall I'd say it's pretty much an app
yeah it's it's definitely not not crap
for sure the only downside
the only downside what is eating
crackers if you want to stack crackers
along with the game itself but it's kind
of addicting so beware of that because
once you start playing there's no we're
gonna play it once that is it for us in
this video if you guys liked it give it
a big thumbs up we'll be putting the
links for this app down below in the
description for both Android and iOS so
look for those but anyways thank you for
watching
yeah thanks for watching guys alright
I'm out and I'm Mamba
that's the only line I had yeah it goes
like would you read it drink it do I
should I read it I'll just read it
are you alright I was like not so
perfect - oh you're the boxes backwards
oh that's a horrible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
