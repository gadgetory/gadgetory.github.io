title as the fumble style speech champ
to maybe the one phone that Apple really
doesn't want to lose to in the galaxy as
ten plus and well part of it was due to
the fact that the ascent plus is just a
beast of a smartphone it did kind of
feel like it was more the iPhone losing
in that match than the s10 plus winning
considering that the iPhone took a step
backwards in RAM management's with it
failing to keep all the apps open in the
background despite being able to do so
in a previous test so today we have the
long-awaited rematch we have the public
beta of iOS 13 installed on this iPhone
here which you know while still buggy
and not official in any way it does at
least give us a window into seeing
whether or not RAM management has
improved and if Apple's claims of apps
in iOS 13 launching two times faster
actually makes a difference in a
real-world test I don't know I'm kind of
skeptical Apple loves to make these big
lofty claims but let's find out
after the test you can find the official
fumble of style rankings on our website
at the link below which we created with
a sponsor of today's video in Wix so
with Wix making a website has never been
easier whether you use the drag-and-drop
editor on a computer like I did or you
use wix's artificial design intelligence
to build a site for you literally using
only your phone you can be up and
running in no time after choosing a
theme and answering just a few basic
questions best parts you can start your
website and try it all out for free at
the special link down below
okay so we'll kick things off by
starting the stopwatch is on each phone
and then jumping into the first row
where right off the bat the sm+ is able
to get this step over the iPhone in the
warm launch of Facebook which is
something that we've noticed in nearly
all our trial runs on these two phones
most likely due to the sm+ being able to
keep more of the app partially stored in
memory thanks to his larger amount of
RAM but either way the iPhone was able
to completely wipe out that small
advantage in facebook with it loading
Starbucks Word and Excel at a faster
rate giving it a nice little cushion as
both phones are now working on the
second row here in Snapseed we have made
things more intensive by adding not one
but two different filters to the same
exact photo where from the looks of it
the iPhone was able to apply the filters
and export the photo at a faster rate
but the iPhone hangs up in launching
Adobe rush along the ascent Plus to make
the comeback and actually pull ahead
already rendering the same exact video
project but it doesn't take long for the
iPhone and its sheer processing power to
make a comeback of its own with it
completing the actual rendering of the
video project significantly faster
allowing it to move ahead to the browser
test where it was able to conduct that
Google trend search and display the
accompanying graphs faster as well now
so far what we've seen isn't the iPhone
actually launching apps faster in the
sm+ but the iPhone being able to
complete the actions within it the apps
faster whether it was loading charts in
Excel applying filters and Snapseed or
exporting a video in rush here in the
gaming row it's a different story the
iPhone has been able to launch most of
these games faster than the s 10 plus
but from what I can tell
out doing a direct comparison it isn't
doing it much faster than it did when
the iPhone was running on iOS 12 and it
definitely isn't launching these apps up
to two times faster like Apple has
claimed we'll see if iOS 13 can do any
better here in the last row where the
focus is on launching the apps more so
than anything else and where the iPhone
has typically been slower than top-tier
Android phones and while the iPhone is
still significantly slower in launching
Spotify the difference wasn't as big as
we've seen in previous tests and ESPN
allowing it to hold on to its lead
clocking in a time of 2 minutes and 3
seconds with the sm+ not being able to
cut down on the iPhone sleeve like it
did before in the last row finishing the
first slap six seconds later with a time
of 2 minutes and 9 seconds and now the
moment we have all been waiting for has
us 13 improved RAM management back to
how it was in the early days of iOS 12
well so far so good the iPhone has kept
all the apps open and ready to go in the
background but unfortunately the iPhone
isn't able to keep Excel open opening
the door for the sm+ to possibly make
its second comeback in the speed test
which with the iPhone also failing to
keep word open is exactly what happens
with the s temp + somewhat justifying
its premium price with a ram to match
keeping all the apps open and completing
the test with a total time of 2 minutes
and 46 seconds with the iPhone failing
to keep all the remaining apps open just
like you did in iOS 12 causing it to
finish 12 seconds later with a time of 2
minutes and 58 seconds making the winner
D Galaxy S 10 + now just to reiterate
this was a beta version of iOS 13 so
this results isn't official by any means
we'll rerun these tests when the final
version of iOS 13 is released later this
year along with that new iPhone so
subscribe to the channel if you don't
want to miss out on that but anyways
that is it for me in this video thank
you guys for watching and as always I'll
see you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
