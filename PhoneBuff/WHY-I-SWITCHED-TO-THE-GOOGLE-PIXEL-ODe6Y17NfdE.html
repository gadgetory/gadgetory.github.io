video that you guys actually requested
so my last video where I told you I was
using the 1 plus 3 as my daily driver
and thinking about switching I asked you
guys if you guys wanted to follow up
most of you guys said yes so here we are
I've decided to switch phones and the
phone I've switched to is the Google
pixel which I'm holding upside down I
say that despite thinking that the
iPhone 7 plus is the better phone
overall now you guys may be wondering
what does that mean right I think the
iPhone 7 plus is better overall yet I
sit here in front of you saying that I'm
using the pixel so why before I answer
that question let's talk about why I
think the iPhone 7 plus is actually the
better phone at least in terms of
hardware right so the iPhone 7 plus has
IP 67 which at this point is a really
big feature to have on phones the pixel
doesn't have that so ip67 water and dust
resistance and then the iPhone 7 plus
also has dual speakers so it's a lot
louder than this guy and this one's a
little bit distorted at times too and
like it easily get covered so it's not
better in that regard as a 2 X optical
zoom camera here's great but being able
to zoom in I think adds a little more
value and uh-oh the design this thing
wasn't my favorite design when I first
saw it it has grown on me ok but I
wasn't a fan of the the two-tone in fact
I asked my four-year-old nephew Mike hey
do you like the way this one looks like
I don't like this the plastic and the
metal heat in those glass but like the
fact that he said plastic up probably
not a good sign
my objection you know on a logical level
is if you're gonna put glass on the back
of the phone
let it be for some purpose I mean they
say it's like to help you get better
reception but I don't really have issues
with like a metal phone so I don't
really buy that Samsung has all glass
phones and you guys have seen the drop
test obviously breaks easily and
obviously this would probably crack -
but you know at least the Samsung phones
come with you know Samsung pay with MST
I don't know if it needs a glass back to
do that but it does have that option and
it has wireless charging so not a fan of
the design has grown on me since I
originally you know laid eyes on it
overall iPhone 7 plus from a hardware
perspective I think is better that's my
opinion
obviously there's counter arguments as
charging its comfortable comfortable
holding the hand it doesn't you know
rock when you're using it on a flat
surface all those things you guys have
seen the reasons videos if you haven't
seen the reasons videos click over here
because I go over 25 reasons why each is
better than the other I did a poll
actually in that video asking you guys
which phone you thought had the strong
reasons and the majority of people voted
for the iPhone 7 plus on both videos
with that out of the way why did I go
with pixel well first off you guys know
I'm an Android fan and you're not gonna
get a better version of Android then you
can get on the pixel the newest version
straight from Google and I just like the
customization and being able to really
create the experience I want on my phone
I'm an enthusiast and I'm gonna take
those actions most people don't that's
why I said the average consumer probably
like the iPhone 7 plus more at the same
time you know there are some pretty
strong reasons why you'd want to use the
pixel and again watch the two videos and
guys will know what I'm talking about or
keep repeating myself however the thing
that kind of tipped the scale for me at
least is actually not a reason included
in any of those videos it's something
that's more personal to me and I think
some of you guys could relate to this
and that is I feel like the pixel better
represents where we're going in the
future when it comes to technology at
least when compared to the iPhone 7 plus
I felt like if I didn't use a pixel I'd
be missing out what would I be missing
out on in the same way that the g1 let
me experience the growth of Android as a
platform the pixel is setting up the
future for two really really really big
things the first is AI I think
artificial intelligence is you know
BarNone the biggest advance we're going
to make up in technology and obviously
this has the Google assistance on it and
that's going to continue to evolve and
get better as time goes by I want to be
a part of that process and see it grow
obviously Google now is available on
other phones right it's available on the
iPhone but it's kind of hard to get to
so I don't really count that but as well
one other Android phones but the Google
assistants this is a little bit better
integrated on the pixel and the second
thing is the daydream platform right the
VR they have
oh how my heads are here they have the
dedicated daydream view headset and for
me at least for the phone integration is
the best headset I was comfortable to
wear comes with the remote and there's
not a lot of apps on there right now
kind of reminds me in the early days of
the g1 but I want to see that grow as
well now that's probably not a reason
that applies to some of you guys maybe
some of you guys
it does right I'm so hard core
technology enthusiast and I also have
the luxury of being able to switch back
to the iPhone of this phone gets
annoying alright or I could switch to
the 1 + 3 T or whatever phone I do so
like maybe that doesn't count a lot but
wanting to be a part of the shift that
we're gonna make in the next you know
five or 10 years is is something I think
the Google pixel represents and I just
want to be a part of that like I was
with a g1 so yeah that's why I switched
to the Google pixel outside that I think
that's pretty much it for me in this
video so I will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
