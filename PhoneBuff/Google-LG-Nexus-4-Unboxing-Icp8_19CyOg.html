calm and in this video we're gonna be
unboxing the brand new LG Nexus 4 by
Google so we'll take a look at the box
itself first so on the front we can see
a picture of the device and some Nexus
branding on the left side it says next
is for and the LG logo is at the bottom
on the back it says the best of Google
beyond smart and totally wireless on the
right side again we see the nexus for
branding and the LG logo given that they
are the manufacturer on the top of the
device actually nothing and on the
bottom is just your seal numbers and
whatnot so go ahead and pull off the
cover and you're left with a plain black
box with the silver Nexus logo to open
the box up we have to cut through two
pieces of tape on the sides and then
finally prop off the top cover and you
have your LG Nexus 4 so we'll go ahead
and pull the phone out of the box and
we'll actually power it on so that way
you can see the boot up animation
somewhat while we do the rest of this
unboxing so first thing we'll pull out
of the box is this piece of cardboard
here nothing really much to it here
sometimes manufacturers put pamphlets in
there but not in this case so we'll
throw it off to the side bursting inside
the box you'll see is the LG Nexus 4
quick start guide also within this
packet there's the terms and conditions
so throw that off to the side got a
tmobile sim card because i got it from
t-mobile but we'll ignore that for now
we got a USB wall adapter here that we
could plug in our micro USB cable and
speaking of that micro USB cable we have
it right over here nothing fancy here
just your standard USB to microUSB and
then finally we have this sim card door
key which is for our micro sim card and
that is pretty much it for the box
alright so let's start the hardware
torso on the front we have an earpiece
and a 1.3 megapixel front facing camera
we have a 4.7 inch IPS display with 1280
by 768 resolution and at the bottom we
have our LED notification light on the
back we have our speaker grill LG logo
and of course the Nexus logo an 8
megapixel camera with LED flash on the
right side we have a micro sim card slot
and volume rocker for volume up and down
on the left side we have nothing but a
power button to turn the screen or the
device on and off on the bottom we have
a microphone and micro USB charging port
and fine
at the top we have a secondary Mike and
3.5 millimeter headphone jack okay to
finish up this unboxing I'll give you
guys a quick sneak peek at the software
skip through the process here setting up
the phone because I'm sure you've seen
it a dozen times and we'll get straight
to my favorite part of any unboxing
which is taking off the protective
layering off the screen I mean you just
gotta love that I never get bored of it
so we'll go ahead and take a look at the
software now and as you guys may or may
not know android 4.2 jellybean is super
smooth of course the nexus 4 Snapdragon
s4 pro processor may be helping out with
that will take a look at 4.2 s new quick
settings which makes things a little bit
more convenient and then finally we'll
hop into the settings to verify the
phone is indeed running on Android 4.2
and of course take a look at the easter
egg alright guys that's it for me in
this video if you found it helpful
please give it a thumbs up and if you
haven't already hit that subscribe
button for more nexus 4 coverage thank
you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
