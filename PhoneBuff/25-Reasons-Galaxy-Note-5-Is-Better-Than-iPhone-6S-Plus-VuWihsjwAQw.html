Note 5 in the iPhone 6s plus r2 the best
all-around smartphones out right now so
in this two-part video series we're
going to be comparing them but we're not
gonna be doing just any comparison and
instead like we've been doing since all
the way back in 2012 we're gonna be
doing it foam buff style where we're
going to look at a bunch of reasons why
each smartphone can be considered better
than the other let's go ahead and get
right into it
reason number one while both ones have
big screens the no.5 screen is bigger
and has over 75% more pixels which
combined with the richer colors from the
AMOLED display makes for a better
overall viewing experience too and it
packs that bigger better display in a
smaller form factor with the note 5
being shorter narrower and generally
easier to hold in the hand thanks to the
curved edges on the back 3 while battery
life is similar on both smartphones with
fast charging the note 5 charges up in
less than half the time it takes to
fully charge up the iPhone 6s plus 4 and
as if that weren't enough the note 5
also has ultra power saving mode that is
able to extend a 10 percent charge to
last for over 24 hours
reason number 5 when you're dealing with
screens this big you'll naturally want
to be able to use multiple apps on the
screen at the same time which is
something you can do on the note 5 but
you can't do on the iPhone 6s plus 6 the
note 5 comes with the S Pen which is a
pressure-sensitive stylus that comes
with a host of great apps to support it
that make for the ultimate note-taking
experience 7 unlike the iPhone 6s plus
the note 5 has a dedicated heart rate
monitor that works with Samsung's s
health app which can better help you
stay on top of your health 8 with
private mode on the Galaxy Note 5
you can hide just about any file on your
phone like a picture or a video for
example with it only being visible to
you when the password-protected private
mode is enabled
9 if you're ever in an emergency with
you note 5 you can triple tap the power
button to automatically send a text to
the people on your emergency contact
list giving them your location a picture
from both cameras and a short sound
recording so that way they can get a
better idea of where you are and what's
actually happening to you reason number
10 on the note 5 you can set default
application
which means you can slide third-party
apps to replace a system app for example
if you want to use Skype to make calls
when tapping on a phone number from an
email you can set Skype as default over
the dialer where on the iPhone the best
you can do is just copy and paste the
number each and every time which is
nowhere near as convenient 11 on the
note 5 you can drag and drop files from
your phone onto your computer without
needing to install any special software
like iTunes you can also manage the
files on your phone straight from your
phone with the built-in file manager 12
while both phones feature 5 megapixel
front facing cameras the one in the note
5 has a wider angled lens so you can fit
more people or background into your
selfies 13 while the starting prices for
both homes are similar the note 5 comes
with double the storage onboard at 32
gigabytes compared to just 16 gigabytes
on the iPhone 6s plus making a better
value from a storage standpoint 14 on
the note 5 you can double tap the home
button from any screen to open up the
camera quickly which helps ensure that
you never miss those Kodak moments
reason number 15 sure the iPhone 6s plus
can copy-and-paste but with the note 5s
clipboard feature you can keep up to 20
pieces of text and images copied to the
clipboard letting you paste any one of
them at any given time 16 Apple pay on
the iPhone 6s plus works at over 700,000
retail locations which sounds like a
really big number but when you look at
Samsung pay which works at over 30
million locations it pales in comparison
making the note 5 the best bet to
actually replace your wallet 17 unlike
the iPhone 6s plus the note 5 can be
charged without a wire by simply setting
the phone onto a compatible charging pad
18 even though iOS has gotten better
with third-party sharing options the
note 5 still has to beat when it comes
to sharing allowing you to share your
content straight from one app directly
to another way more often 19 if you
don't like the way something looks on
the iPhone 6s plus too bad as you can't
really do anything about it but on the
note 5 you can swap out the launcher
apply a new theme and even customize the
quick settings to your own liking reason
number 20 if you have a missed
notification on the iPhone this is what
you see on the note 5 on the other hand
you get a blinking LED light letting you
know if mister
patience without you having to turn the
screen on in order to check 21 while the
iPhone 6s plus has a feature that makes
the screen easier to reach for a few
seconds only the note 5 has the option
to keep the screen smaller for as long
as you like making it easier to use with
one hand 22 the note 5 has USB OTG
support which lets you easily connect
things like a mouse a keyboard and even
a USB flash drive to the phone with a
relatively cheap OTG cable 23 unlike on
the iPhone 6s plus when you buy an app
on the note 5 you have a two hour window
where you can easily return it out right
from the phone if the app didn't meet
your expectations 24 on the note 5 you
can schedule text messages to send at a
specified time for example at 12 o'clock
midnight for wishing someone a happy
birthday which is something you can't do
on the iPhone and finally reason number
25 whether you're running low on battery
or if you're charging up the note 5
we'll give you an estimate of how long
it will take for your battery to die or
how long it'll take to get fully charged
helping you better manage your battery
life all right so those are the top 25
reasons why the note 5 could be
considered better than the iPhone 6s
plus
now the word better is subjective so be
sure to watch the iPhone 6s Plus this
version which will be annotated
somewhere on the screen and will also be
linked for you down below in the
description thank you guys for watching
in as always I'll see you in the very
next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
