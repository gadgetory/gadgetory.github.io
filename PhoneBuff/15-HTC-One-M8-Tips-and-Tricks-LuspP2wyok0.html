fen in this video I'll be covering 15
tips and tricks for the HTC One m8 that
I think it'd be really helpful now some
of these tips are basic to Android and
others are exclusive to HTC Sense but
almost all of them will help you get the
most out of the HTC One m8 so with that
said let's go ahead and get right into
it
alright so the first tip is to use
motion launched to unlock the m8 like
the name implies motion launched will
allow you to jump straight into things
from when the screen is off as long as
the phone detects a little bit of motion
like when you pick the one up or pull it
out of your pocket so having the screen
to the left takes you straight to the
home screen
swiping to the right jumps you into
blinkfeed swiping up takes you to the
last screen you were looking at before
the screen was locked
swiping down activates HTC's voice
dialer and double tapping on the screen
will take you to the lock screen where
you can quickly get information like the
time weather and even miss notifications
while also being able to turn this way
off easily by double tapping on the
screen again the final trick in this
giant first tip is to pick up the phone
in landscape orientation and press one
of the volume keys to launch straight
into the camera to speak let the camera
you can switch back and forth between
the front and rear cameras by swiping
across the screen in either direction
which I found to be a lot easier and
faster than switching through the camera
apps UI 3 well my favorite features but
the m8 camera is as per shot abilities
but by default brashaad is limited to
taking a maximum of 20 photos which can
be increased up to 99 by going into the
camera settings
tapping on continuous shooting and
unchecking the limit to 20 frames
options so you can help but guarantee
that you'll capture that Kodak moment 4
but of course those Kodak moments don't
always happen right away so putting the
camera into standby mode while you're
waiting can help save some battery life
do this by pressing the power button to
turn the screen off and when you're
ready to take a picture press the power
button again and the phone will take you
straight back into the camera regardless
of whether or not you have a lock screen
password enabled 5 since we're on the
topic of saving battery the fifth tip is
to show the ones battery percentage up
in the notification bar by going into
the mains
some settings tapping on power and then
checking on the show battery level
option 6 the quick settings in the
notification shade give you easy access
to the commonly used settings but
accessing them in the traditional way
isn't really all that quick so instead
try stepping down with two fingers
instead of one which will take you
straight to the quick settings menu oh
and the toggles are actually
customizable so you can choose just what
toggles you want to show up seven
depending on where you get your HTC One
from you might be bombarded with a bunch
of uninstalled apps or blower that you
may not want but luckily you have two
options to get rid of them one of them
is to hit the menu button and then hide
apps on the launcher where you can check
off the apps you want to hide the second
option is to disable these apps
completely by going into the system
settings
tapping on app manager swiping over all
the way to all apps and then searching
for the app that you want to disable
once you find it
press the disable button and be done
with it eight an easy way to free up
storage space is by going into the
system settings
tapping on storage and then pressing the
make more space option from here you'll
be able to see just how much storage
space you have left on the phone and you
also get a breakdown of what exactly is
taking up that space to begin with you
can delete things straight from this
menu but do keep in mind that whatever
you delete here will be permanently
removed from your phone 9 by default
when you get an incoming call you can
pick the HTC one up and lift it to your
ear to automatically answer and while I
think this feature is cool if you want
for any reason to disable this you can
go into system settings tap on call and
then uncheck the auto answer calls
option 10 when selecting text sometimes
your fingers can be your own worst enemy
by getting into the way of what you're
trying to select so the tenth tip is to
enable a pop-up window that enlarges
text while selecting by going into the
system settings
tapping on accessibility and then
checking the show magnifier option 11 in
almost every HTC app or menu you can
automatically scroll to the top of
whatever you're looking at by tapping on
the notification bar which I found to be
especially useful in apps like blinkfeed
where the list can get really really
long 12 if you ever want to know what a
certain
in an app without actually having to
press it in order to find out you can
press and hold on it and get a little
pop-up window with the description of
what the button actually does 13 whether
it's a funny snapchat or a weird text
message that you want to take a
screenshot of you can do so by pressing
and holding the power button and then
quickly tapping the home button right
after if you're in an app where the home
button isn't available you can press and
hold on the power and volume down button
simultaneously to take a screenshot as
well although I found the first method
to be a little bit easier 14 since the
HTC One doesn't have a removable battery
like some of the other phones on the
market if the phone never locks up on
you and is unresponsive your best bet to
restore functionality is to press and
hold the power and volume up button
simultaneously for about 10 seconds
until the phone reboots 15 so the 15th
and final tip for this video is
unlocking the hidden developer options
menu to do this go into the main system
settings tap on about at the very bottom
then I hit software information then hit
more and then finally tap on the build
number 7 or 8 times to become a
developer this will unlock developer
options and allow you to tinker with the
more advanced settings for the phone so
have fun but be careful alright so that
about does it for me in this video if
you found it helpful hit that thumbs up
button down there to help show your love
