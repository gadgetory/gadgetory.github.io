this what I'm doing a benchmarking of
the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 as you guys
can see I have here I'm gonna be doing a
couple of benchmarks will be doing
quadrant and tune - Vellamo CF bench and
last time we're doing a browser mark
benchmark so I'll go ahead and start
with quadrant and then I'll just kind of
skip through each of the benchmarks so I
guess could get the results so I'm a run
full benchmark and like I said I'll skip
to the result and then show you guys the
score at the end
all right so the benchmark is done and
you can see it says your device scored a
five thousand 829 so a really high
benchmark score maybe this is just the
first time I ever run it maybe it could
go a little bit higher considering the
fact that this guy does have a 1.4
gigahertz quad-core processors to
akeno's for a quad with two gigabytes of
RAM but for now we'll just accept that
result and go to the next one which is
an tune - and again i'ma run the test
and then just kind of skip through the
whole process
you
all right so the benchmark is done and
it scored a twelve thousand six hundred
and sixty so again really high score as
is expected with all the power this
guy's packing let's go ahead and go to
the next benchmark which is CF bench all
right so I'll just hit full benchmark
and same thing I'll skip to the end so
you guys can see the results
alright see a bench is done and the
score we got is at the bottom over here
so scroll down okay there you go so you
see your device which is the Galaxy Note
10.1 tops of charts tops the Samsung
Galaxy s3 the HTC One X galaxy etc with
a score of twenty four thousand three
hundred and twenty three seven thousand
and nine and then thirteen thousand nine
hundred and thirty-four so once again
the common theme is this is pretty much
the fastest Android device out and we'll
go on to the next test which is the
valano benchmark so I'll go ahead and
tap on this guy and we'll run it so
let's start and I don't want a tutorial
alright there you go
you
all right so Vellamo is done and we'll
go ahead and hit yes but I see this 2445
says Vellamo sings 2004 145 is your
score and we'll just hit yes and there
you go you see it tops the charts
completely and you know it's throwing
comparing with HTC One XL HD 1x which
has to take a three processor the
transformer prime which it does as well
and a whole bunch of other devices you
can see this guy is definitely topping
the charts with the EcoSport quad and to
get what's RAM needless to say it's
really powerful and the last benchmark
we'll run is the browser market
benchmark and we'll be done
you
all right so the browser market
benchmark is done and it got the highest
score I've ever seen on it a hundred and
sixty three thousand seven hundred and
sixty-four just amazing I you know just
got this guy today and at this benchmark
before you guys you guys could see I'm
really looking forward to using it so
far no lag everything is flying as you
know you'd expect with the stat sheet
that you see but anyway stay tuned for
more videos and be doing the following
review of course we'll be doing
comparisons to other device so you guys
could see how this guy steps up to the
likes of the iPad you know the third
generation the Nexus 7 etc so anyway
