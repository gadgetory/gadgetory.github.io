will show you how you connect your Xbox
360 controller to your Android phone I
already did a video on the channel about
how Ice Cream Sandwich lets you connect
USB devices to your Android phone and
obviously I am running on Ice Cream
Sandwich you do with jellybean of course
as well I have the Samsung Galaxy s3
here which I'm gonna be demonstrating on
obviously this is gonna be using that
same functionality I just never
demonstrated the actual Xbox 360
controller in that video so what you're
gonna need is an OTG cable OTG stands
for on-the-go
I bought scared from Amazon for like
seven bucks anyway it has a female input
for the USB and a male input which is
micro USB which goes into the phone
here's the other end of the xbox360
controller I'm just gonna plug it into
the OTG cable like that and then this
end I'm gonna plug into the phone my
case is t samsung galaxy s3 but you know
your phone should work as long as the
charging port has the correct pins that
let this work now you can see the Xbox
360 controller is actually flashing and
on the phone itself at least with the
galaxy s3 you get a little notification
up in the notification bar
so I plugged in EC says USB connected
disconnected I just plugged it in and
now says USB connector connected you can
see the GTA 3 icon is actually selected
and I could actually move around using
the joystick right over here but I'm
gonna go ahead and start it up it
doesn't work like you think like you
know pressing a won't open it up but if
you actually open the game up yourself
and I use the controller now I'll put it
down it does work you know as you'd
expect the joystick works perfectly the
turbo button or to run fast you have to
press and hold a pressing B will punch
around and this actually works you know
right out the box when you download the
application from the Play Store you plug
in your Xbox 360 controller you don't
need root or anything like that it just
works mainly due to the fact that you
know rockstar games included support for
it so you can see I'm pressing a to
accelerate so you don't press RT RT
actually gives you the side views which
is you know I mean I don't really I'd
rather be the other way around being
able to celebrate with this and break
with this but if break is actually X now
so it's not that bad
lb changes the radio stations and all
that good stuff so anyway you can see
it's fully functional and if I wanted to
stop and get out of the car and get into
a little fight with somebody I could do
that press Y to get out go over here and
you know start doing whatever you do in
GTA so you can see it works pretty well
makes the game a lot more enjoyable
makes me feel like my phone's almost
like a little console being able to do
this I enjoy it much more than having to
use the touchscreen of course if you
wanted you can still use the touchscreen
as well so I'll go ahead and hit home to
back out of here and show you another
game really quick I'll just do will do
dead trigger so it's I can show you a
first-person shooter and this game is
actually free from google play and like
I said it does actually support the Xbox
360 controller right out the box so I'll
right out the gate say so here's the
game was gonna run a quick mission and
demonstrate how it works for you guys
now this one's a little bit different
because you can be using both joystick
so this one's gonna be you know moving
it around where this one's gonna be at
the directional joystick so it's a
little bit interesting to see how this
works but works very smoothly let's go
ahead and get out if I can't do it
through the viewfinder right there you
go and shoot some zombies pressing LT
will zoom in this case and the controls
are a little bit different depending on
you know the game that you're playing
and you know you should note that not
all games work with this so you know
right out the box not every other rather
game that everything works I mean this
one seems to be working pretty fine it
takes a while to get used to as far as
the sensitivity it's not like you know
it is on the regular Xbox game but once
you get used to it it is pretty cool and
you know like I said it definitely makes
the whole gaming experience a little bit
better so go ahead and hit home now I'll
show you really quick another game that
doesn't support this future so go ahead
asphalt 6 which I have on my phone this
is a racing game I'm really simple
controls you'd expect you know left to
turn left right maybe a nitrous button
and that's pretty much it but it doesn't
actually work so I'll go ahead and show
you guys that it doesn't work and I am
gonna be doing a video later on that's
gonna show you an application called
USB joy Center that lets you map your
controller or whatever
whether it's an Xbox resistant
controller or a ps3 controller to
actually work but in order for it to
work you do need root access so you know
it's not one of those things are gonna
work with the stock phone like this is
are the two games that are shredding
before and I really don't know all the
games that work with the Xbox controller
but I know there's a lot of them out
there you might have to read the
comments you know in the app description
to be able to tell but as you see this
one you know no matter what I do nothing
is working I think why is the only
button that works it lets me change
views but other than that it's
completely useless so this wanted to
show you guys you know really quickly
how the Xbox 360 controller works you
know like I said it's completely stock
you know if you have that long students
in the floor you can run games like GTA
shrine lunar actually works dead trigger
works modern combat 3 and asphalt 6
don't work those are both created by
game laughs maybe it's a game loft thing
hopefully they had support for it in the
future but check out the video I'm gonna
be doing on the channel if you're
interested in learning how to map the
Xbox 360 role or any controller for
other games that aren't natively
supported if you do have root access but
anyway that's it for me in this video if
you found it helpful please hit the like
button and subscribe to channel thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
