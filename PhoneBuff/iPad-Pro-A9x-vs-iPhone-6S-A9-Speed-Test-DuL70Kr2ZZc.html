7 is on its way in so you can bet that
we're gonna be having a punch of bumble
style videos coming soon but in the
meantime we're gonna do a speed test
that's I've been wanting to do for a
really long time now in the iPad pro
against the iPhone success now some of
you may be wondering why we're testing
an iPad against an iPhone and really the
reason is simple the iPad pro is using
Apple's a 9 X chip which is a step up
from the chip found in the iPhone
success this more powerful chip may just
give us a little sneak peek of what we
can expect out of the iPhone 7 which is
using the even more powerful 810 fusion
but before we get into it I want to give

slash buff that's dollarshaveclub.com
slash buff alright let's get right into
the speed test all right so we'll kick
things off by starting these stop
watches on each device and then move on
to the first row of system apps where
the iPhone 6s gets the step on the iPad
pro as it moves on to the gaming row but
its lead doesn't last for long as the
iPad pro just ripped through asphalt 8
with both phones now neck and neck as
they load up Angry Birds and from the
looks of it the iPad pro is loading up
Angry Birds faster than the successes
giving it the lead as it finishes up
with Angry Birds and moves on to subway
surfers so early on it seems like the
2.1 gigahertz a 9 X under the hood of
the
Pro is overpowering the 1.8 Giga
find in the iPhone success and we
haven't even got to the part of the test
where I expected to make biggest
difference in lab Civ where each device
will have they create a time-lapse from
these same exact video file so here we
go the iPad pro is now working on laughs
it which again is the single-most
processor intensive task in this whole
speed test and Wow
the iPad pro is just ripping through it
faster than I've ever seen any device
ever do so here at bomba making the rate
at which the iPhone 6s is processing the
same video look almost slow in
comparison alright so at this point I
think is worth mentioning that the iPad
pro has a bit of a disadvantage for
these last three apps with is showing
much more content on screen due to its
larger size which technically gives the
iPad more things that have to load then
the iPhone does with its smaller screen
but that didn't seem to matter all that
much with the iPad finishing the first
lap with the time of 1 minute and 23
seconds and the iPhone 6s still playing
a bit of catch-up here in the last few
apps finishing a full 11 seconds later
with the time of 1 minute and 34 seconds
now an 11 second advantage in that first
lap may not seem like all that much but
considering that the iPhone success is
the fastest phone we have ever tested
here on the channel it's a pretty big
difference especially when you consider
that the new iPhone 7 is packin apples
all new quad-core 810 fusion chip which
looks to be even more powerful than the
a9x found in the iPad pro so yeah I'm
excited I can't wait for the iPhone 7 I
can't wait to put it through the phone
book style speed test and I can't wait
to see how it stacks up against the
competition but anyways there you have
it the iPad pro beats the iPhone 6s by
over 10 seconds giving us a little sneak
peek of what we can expect out of the
iPhone 7 thank you guys for watching it
as always I'll see you in the very next
