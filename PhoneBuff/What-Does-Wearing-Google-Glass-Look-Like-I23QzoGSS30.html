bluff and in this video i'm gonna giving
you an in-depth look at google glass by
giving you a walk-through of the UI
throwing you the settings and also
showing you how google glass actually
works now obviously i won't be able to
film this directly because it's on my
face
so instead I'll be doing a screencast
which you can see on the monitor here so
that way you guys can kind of follow
along as I go through it but with that
said the screencast is a little laggy so
keep that in mind because Google glass
actually isn't as laggy as it is here if
I do encounter some lag I'll let you
know in the video but otherwise let's go
ahead and get started alright so as you
guys can see I busted out the shades so
the highway I don't look cross-eyed the
entire video looking at this little
screen but it's go ahead and get started
by turning on Google glass so there's
actually two ways to do this one is by
touching the touch sensitive area right
here so I'll go ahead and tap it and you
guys can see the home screen you see a
big old clock and a reminder of the
voice command that unlocks all the other
voice commands but there's also another
way which I'll show you
you actually could turn it off and then
touch your head up like that and it
comes on so I'll go ahead and say the
voice command okay glass and you can see
I'm giving it a list of options here so
I can actually scroll through them by
looking up and down or tilting my head
up and down and I could say any one of
them and it'll actually start it so I'll
go ahead and say Google how tall is Kobe
Bryant and there you go so I don't know
you guys can't hear that but it's saying
code Bryan is six feet six inches tall
and little earpiece but it works pretty
well so before I actually go more
indefinitely I want to show you guys the
actual options you guys have with Google
glass so obviously what like we just did
we have Google but you also could take a
picture record a video get directions
message somebody call somebody and
finally do a video call via Google+ so
in a nutshell that's pretty much what
you could do on Google glass now I know
you guys may think that's actually
really limited and it kind of feels like
that a person obviously you know it's in
this very early stages and I'm sure
it'll be expanded upon in the future but
for right now this is pretty much what
you could do in Google glass but haven't
option two just Google something really
doesn't limit you that much if you guys
have used Google now you know that you
could do a bunch of stuff with it so
I'll go ahead and show you another way
of actually googling something anyway so
I'll turn it off and you could actually
press and hold on the touch sensitive
area and it takes you straight to a
Google search so how old is Michael
Jordan and it seems like I can only
think of basketball questions here
alright so Michael Jordan is 50 years
old you can see the screen there and
again I heard it in my ear but you guys
might not be able to hear it I'm not
sure anyways what's cool about this is
actually it remembers your search so who
is he married to and are actually search
you know might that question based off
of what I actually asked previously so
renesis can't reach Google server so
let's try that again okay glass Google
how old is Michael Jordan alright so it
worked this time I'll shut it again
who is he married to
there you go so you say Yvette cry out
Oh or Prieto so anyway I hear it and
that's actually in 2013 according to
this thing so anyway I you see how it
works it remembers your past search
which is pretty cool but obviously
there's a lot more we can do it make you
cool just about anything and we'll go
ahead and do a math problem just to show
you guys what's eight hundred and sixty
divided by four so hey I actually
understood it as 160 and I don't know
maybe I'm talking a little fast but for
the most part I found it to be pretty
accurate let's go ahead and try
something else
whoops 94 divided by seven there you go
so you can see it works um like I said
it's pretty accurate for the most part
for my experience but you know sometimes
you do have those occasional hiccup so
let's go ahead and show you other stuff
so I'll go ahead and show you how to
take a picture basically you could
either do it this way or you have a
button right here they could actually
press to take pictures that I find to be
a little bit easier so go ahead and
press that and basically it just took a
picture of what I'm looking at which is
just a camera we'll go ahead and I'm not
gonna record a video since I already did
a video sample on the channel which gets
to checkout gave directions so Starbucks
and basically it's gonna find the
nearest Starbucks based off of my
phone's GPS location so see Starbucks I
can tap on it get directions to it I'm
not gonna do that because I don't really
need directions right now but we'll go
ahead and hit this again and that the
only reason I'm going through here not
doing voice commands is because I want
you guys to be able to see the menu
options on the screen so get directions
you can message somebody so I'm gonna go
ahead and message somebody and my
favorite contacts are actually gonna
show up so I'll go ahead and message her
what's up I'm recording a video right
now so don't message me back and you see
I have the option to swipe down to
cancel and that way if I said something
wrong or if it didn't understand me
correctly I could cancel before it sends
off you know a bad text message but
there you go you see it sense we'll go
ahead and
go through the breasts just to kind of
show you so we did messaging well you
know what I'm not gonna show you a call
I mean it works as a Bluetooth headset
like a normal Bluetooth headset so
you'll be able to hear them through here
and they'll be able to hear you through
the mic but it'll call
I'm not gonna show you either but
basically you see the person's video
feed through glass and they see what
you're seeing so if you have a mirror
you might be able to do a video chat but
anyways that's what you could do as far
as glass goes so go ahead and show you
we'll go ahead and look at the settings
really quick so you can see here this is
a Google now card and it's basically
warning me about a wildfire which is
around my area you can see here I have a
card for weather and I don't know if you
guys notice the at the top right there's
a little peel or a little tab which
basically means that there's more cards
underneath it so if I press the side bar
here I actually get out further you know
a three-day forecast so it gives me more
detail to back out of it just swipe down
and it takes me one step back I can
swipe over to the Settings you can see I
have 62% battery and again we have that
little peel at the top right so I could
tap it and go further into the settings
so I'm connected to my Wi-Fi my HTC One
is connected I have my device info says
I have 12.5 gigabytes free of space the
head wake up position is set to 35
degrees so this is what I'll talk about
when you can actually tilt your head up
so actually I can actually turn this off
which sometimes you give I can find it a
little bit annoying when I'm driving for
example and they're like a kind of a
bumpy road and it kind of turns on when
I don't want it to so I could turn it
off or you can just kind of set the
weight like angle to be a little bit
higher so right now it's at 18 or 35 so
I can make you go to like 40 40 s and
max I'll go ahead and set that so that
way it doesn't accidentally go on during
this video so anyway that's how you do
that head-on detection is a little bit
different so basically what this is
there's a little sensor inside of glass
that detects whether or not you're
wearing it so you can turn it off where
I not have it on I'll go ahead and turn
it off and basically what happens is
with it off I could take it off and it's
still gonna ruin on it doesn't realize
that I took it off and I can put it on
same exact thing but if I turn on the
head detection I hit calibrate it's
gonna ask me to take glass off and then
put it back on and touch the touchpad so
I'll go ahead and do that so I'll take
it off I'll put it back on
touchpad and this is Calgary so now what
happens is you see there's a little
chime that you hear and as soon as I put
it back on the screens gonna turn right
back on and you hit another little chime
so that's actually really cool and I
think it saves battery so I usually
leave that on let's see you go back into
here you have your volume so this is
actually something that was brand new or
just incorporated with the update I just
got recently you could actually switch
this despite swiping over just like that
so that's a pretty nice little feature
and then the last thing you have is
guest mode this is if you want to share
your glass with somebody else and they
just kind of want to check it out and
you don't want them kind of going
through your text messages or anything
like that you turn this guy on just by
pressing turn on and now go ahead and
demo some of the stuff here because they
have more example cards and goodies that
we could look at while we're exploring
the rest of glass so I'll swipe over so
you can see this person for example took
our did a google search of what our
jellyfish you could see a picture they
took a text message they got and just
stuff like that another Google search
and you could kind of swipe through the
history by doing that if you swipe
quickly like this you get a zoomed out
version of it so you can see here's a
Google now card for example I have a it
would say I have a flight at whatever
time so this is 11 o'clock and it tells
you the traffic there is so this is what
it looked like once you really start
using Google now the reason why why my
Google now doesn't have a lot of stuff
on there is because I just switched my
phone so I think it's still like loading
it I always search on my phones which is
kind of the downside of this job but
anyway we'll go ahead and actually want
to show you up I'm gonna use the voice
control real quick okay glass Google
phone buff phone box I will try that
again
phone buff there you go so this time it
actually understood me which is nice I
think I'm not speaking clearly enough so
anyway you can see you get regular
search results whenever there is an
actual Google now answer for you so it's
going through some YouTube results um
the website so I'll go ahead and
actually show you that you could load up
web sites on here so I'll go ahead and
hit tap button and basically the only
option you have here is to view the
website go ahead and tap that and it's
loading it up now Google Apps by no
means is it quake is not like you're you
know HTC ones you galaxy has fours with
quad-core processors it's not that fast
at all and I mean honestly it's not
built for what browsing the web I think
Google just recently added that because
they wanted to give that feature or they
wanted to have that ability I mean it
doesn't hurt but you see it is taking a
really long time to load and this is
actually a mobile version which I find
to be more optimized for Google apps
because when I use full version of sites
like I went to the verge comm one day
with the full site this to try it out
and it completely crashed I mean of
course this is like I said early stage
you know model of Google glass I'm sure
a lot of the stuffs gonna be fixed when
the consumer version comes out but this
is how it is you can scroll down so you
can see it is lagging one thing I'll
point out though if you use two fingers
and put it on the touchpad you could
actually look around this is how you
actually click on link so say I wanted
to click on that link I let go whatever
that wherever that little circle is I
tap on it and it's gonna give me the
option to select link so I did that
really quick so select link and that's
all the only option I have
I get tap it and it'll take me to that
article that it's at so we'll go ahead
and swipe down because I don't feel like
waiting that long one thing I do want to
show you though really quick is we'll go
through the app so you see this is my
path search this the text message I said
earlier in the video it's the picture I
took and so say this is a search that I
have and I don't want somebody to know
that I searched this or if I just want
to get out of my history I could just
tap on it and I get it stro result or I
could delete it so I'll go ahead and tap
delete and you can see it takes it right
off the history and you can do the same
thing with email
are texting a Julie them what the emails
even gives you the option to archive it
so oh here this is the Apple one to show
so this I have a New York Times app
enabled basically what apps are it
really just it pushes out information to
Google us so you can see have a card for
New York Times says two new updates a
tap on it and basically it gives me two
cards that are you know basically just
news obviously there's different apps
that are available but not that many
that's how it works so it's not an
interactive applica for example Twitter
I can't answer this going and scroll my
feet like you would think it's more or
less if somebody mentions me or you know
talks about me on Twitter I'll get
notified through glass that way so
here's an email I could actually hit
read more which will read it aloud to me
reply to it or archive so go ahead
archive and there you go but last thing
I want to show you you know I want to
keep this video as short as possible are
you getting kind of long is in the
settings it's like almost like a little
hidden easter egg like android has when
you tap on the device info you get a
hidden easter egg with this the same
thing you hit view licenses wait for it
to load i want to show you this hidden
easter egg so basically the same thing
as the android just keep on tapping it
and it makes an ascending chime and it
says meet the team which i don't even
know if you guys saw that but i tapped
it really quick so basically what's
loading up here is a photosphere of a
whole bunch of google employees wearing
glass so this is when i first saw this i
was this really really amazed by it
because it really just kind of shows you
the potential I mean imagine some kind
of virtual reality game and it works you
know everywhere I'm looking it works
exactly you know how you'd think it
would I could look up I can look down I
could turn all the way around to so you
know you guys can see that I mean really
really cool otherwise that is pretty
much it for this video I mean I don't
want to talk too much there is a review
coming up on the website so stay tuned
follow me on twitter at bomba and i'll
let you guys know as soon as that comes
out but anyways thats it for me in this
video if you liked it please give it a
thumbs up and subscribe to the channel
