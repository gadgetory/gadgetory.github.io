excited for today's video because today
world boxing the Moto Z now I don't
normally get excited about Bonin
boxing's back we rarely do them here in
the channel but the reason why we're
doing this unboxing today because we're
not just unboxing the model Z we're
unboxing the accessories that you can
get with it here you have the incipio
power pack they can just attach with
this modular design and then my personal
favorite I think I've been waiting for
since the day Motorola announced this
phone is the sound boost by JBL that
supposedly you snap onto your phone and
you got a little portable speaker with
you anywhere you go so super excited
like I said let's go ahead and start
unboxing which one first which one first
we'll do the phone Thank You Motorola
for sending us a phone and phone itself
okay wow so first impression is damn
this thing is thin our visit amazing
super thin so that way when you have
your taps on here that's not gonna feel
like it's Tuesday which I'm actually
curious about that so let's go ahead and
pop that on for now looks nice and clean
and see what else is inside the box that
is a wood design I mean that looks clean
I like to look at that so I mean this is
how how thick the phone is gonna be
normally so you're not gonna be rocking
it I imagine without any attachment but
this is clean this is clean and yeah the
camera doesn't bulge out when you take
this thing off you're gonna have a crazy
camera hump look at that yeah you're not
gonna want that got your power brick oh
so it's up my aura USB type-c it's not
which that kind of sucks let's open this
guy up yeah so this is not detachable is
it no you can't mean yeah it's a brace
one thing but yeah I don't think you
connected to a computer there's no
headphone jack on this phone they eat
Apple to it
they beat Apple to it take this little
thing off I hate when people leave this
on you know so haha
I remember I've seen my cousin's they
had their like original screen or
packaging material on their screen
instead of giving a screen protector
that's so ghetto guys don't don't do
that just get a screen protector first
thing the incipio off-grid power pack Oh
kind of rip the box there you go so this
is gonna add some thickness to the phone
nothing else here all right
moment of truth I want to see how this
thing actually works I've only seen it
seen in the video so far so I am very
very curious as to how I'm gonna get
this off let's see how easy this is to
attach you got your connectors right
over here in theory they just attach and
it works treasurer the phone on first
probably oh ho little dude before and
after all right there you go hmm it adds
definite weight to the phone this feels
pretty heavy we turn the phone on yeah
so it has a nice little texture to the
back kind of a little bit grippy your
camera usually you're used to a
protruding camera this is the opposite
it's going inwards it's like a belly
button you gotta any orality and this is
it any all right so we went through the
boring phone process not gonna bore you
guys with that but the phone is set up
we have the power pack right here we're
gonna connect it and see if we get any
kind of animation so clasp it on get a
cool little animation and a little sound
of jingle letting you know that's 67%
so the battery pack is at 67% this
little widget right here actually told
me that was cool that's the battery pack
you know I mean how many
thing Scott 2220 milliamps of battery in
addition to what you have on the phone
already it's freaking cool with it right
the moto mods simple and easy to connect
but like I said earlier what I really
want to see is this thing what do we get
here
whoo this is pretty big all right Mehcad
rip through here all right go okay so
here it is the sound boosts
you also got a little kickstand this
thing is freakin cool this is what
modular design should be right what is
that
let's go USB type-c port right there
high quality JBL audio integrated
kickstand Oh up to 10 hours of music can
be built in battery that's that's pretty
impressive
yeah yeah it's powering itself connect
this thing all right a lot thicker and a
lot heavier of a phone that I'm used to
this thing we're gonna we're gonna put
in your pocket you gotta have a belt
this is gonna pull your pants down
Wow yeah look at that you like stash
something in there yeah like for like a
little shot glass or something right JBL
sound boost now you can pop out the
kickstand and turn up the volume
moto mod 61% it's nice how they tell you
right off the bat how much battery life
your mod actually has no I want to watch
want to watch with David dead all right
oh you know fullness so the fullness of
the audio is that like you're watching
it on TV
wow it's time in a full volume
Wow oh yeah
Bombo song fumble song come on David
yes he's inspired he's motivated he's
backed me home oh wow
sounds good
Wow okay guys so I guess you can kind of
expect that from JBL I just this the
fact that I was a phone accessory I
wasn't expecting that much out of it but
damn that sound blew me away God look
how easy that is you just snap it off
what you want to see it yeah all right
she's so I don't want to share it's all
mine so this is what it sounds like
without the speaker attached oh my
goodness
where's the Speak understand always
coming out here that front facing that
below yeah Wow
alright let's connect this thing again
all right so you guys heard it you heard
what it sounds like wow oh my gosh this
changes everything guys this this
changes everything
this is damn impressive oh my god I want
it like I could actually see here and
watch Netflix all day with this thing
you're on your lunch break maybe
watching a YouTube video maybe you're
watching this YouTube video oh shit
don't drop your phone and pop this guy
on you're off your lunch break boom got
your battery pack
Motorola got it right Motorola got it
right when it comes to modules I mean LG
they tried and you know pad under backs
for that but this is what it this is
what I wanted this is what I wanted when
I heard first heard about modular
designs it's easy it's clean and it
works which one would I go with if I
only had to choose one easy this guy I
mean this one already comes with the
phone
this is the one JBL
with the kickstand that is it for me in
this video I think I'm gonna switch to
this phone honestly I'm gonna try it out
I'm gonna wear my belt nice and tight
this is heavy but is freakin awesome it
is freakin awesome alright guys thank
