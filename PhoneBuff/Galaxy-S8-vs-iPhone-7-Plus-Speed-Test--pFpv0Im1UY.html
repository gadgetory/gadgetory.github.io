tests i think we have all been waiting
for is finally here with a brand new
samsung galaxy s h plus going
head-to-head with the current form of
alpha test champ in the iPhone 7 plus
taking a quick look at the spec sheet
you can see that we're testing the u.s.
variant of the s8 here which packs a new
Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chip to go along
with its four gigabytes of RAM we'll be
testing the International Exynos
variants very soon so make sure you
subscribe to that but with that said
let's go ahead and get right into it all
right we'll kick things off by starting
the stopwatch is on each phone and then
jump right into the first row of system
apps where it's thanks to its quicker
animations the s8 plus takes the lead
already moving on to the second row now
the iPhone is taking longer than usual
on the facebook app allowing the si+ to
pull even further ahead with it now a
full app in front of the iPhones early
on in this speed set but it looks like
the iPhone has made up some ground here
in lapses with it not only loading the
app faster but processing the time-lapse
faster as well with both phones now neck
and neck as they move on to the gaming
row where it looks like the iPhone 7
plus is pulling ahead with a finishing
up with subway surfers and moving on to
flip diving but unlike its predecessors
the Galaxy s8 isn't completely falling
apart here in the gaming row with this
staying hot on the heels of the seven
plus not letting it get anywhere near
the kind of separation we saw the iPhone
6s get last year against the node seven
which means that there's still a good
chance that the si can make a comeback
with plenty of apps left here in the
first lap and the entire second lap left
to go
so as the s8 is working on finishing the
gaming row the iPhone starts working on
the last row which is made up of lighter
weight apps like Spotify and ESPN
allowing the iPhone to momentarily pull
a full app ahead and unfortunately for
the Galaxy S days it doesn't look like
it's closing the gap here in the last
row with the iPhone finishing the first
half at the time of 1 minute and 13
seconds and the s8 falling a little bit
further behind even here with the
lightweight apps so we'll take a closer
look at the individual app load of times
at the end of the video but for now the
s8 comes in 11 seconds later with a time
of 1
and 24 as we've seen time and again the
iPhone 7 plus is having no trouble
keeping almost every app ready to go in
the background while the Galaxy s8 has
to reload both Facebook and snapchat
however ELISA can manage to keep in
shots and lab states open but it failed
to keep subway surfers open allowing the
iPhone to cruise to the finish line with
a total time of 1 minute and 46 seconds
so we'll go ahead and fast-forward the
Galaxy s8 to the finish line
where it failed to keep both flip diving
and stack ready to go but it did manage
to keep smash it along with the rest of
the apps open clocking in a total time
of 2 minutes and 23 seconds making the
winner and still fumble style 3 says
champ the iPhone 7 plus here are the
individual app load up times from the
first lap where you can see where the s8
has the advantage at the beginning and
where the iPhone just completely took
over after laps it even in the
lightweight apps at the end anyways that
is it for me in this video thank you
guys for watching and as always I'll see
you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
