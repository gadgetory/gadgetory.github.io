this video I want to talk to you about
antivirus apps on Android do you need
them do you not need them or are they
just the waste of money basically it
depends on what you're looking for or
what you're looking to get out of these
apps if you're you know mainly getting
it because you're scared to get download
and after has a virus or malware
whatever you want to call it and you
download all your apps from the Google
Play Store then forget about it you
don't really need one because the truth
is you know Google catches most of the
malicious apps before they're ever
published to the Google Play Store and
if some do slip by which obviously is
going to happen from time to time
they're going to capture within a couple
of hours maybe within a couple of days
most and when they do pull it from the
market is going to be automatically
pulled off your phone as well so one day
you'll just wake up if you happen to be
one of those unlucky people who
downloaded app by the way it's got to be
a new app and you have to usually don't
rank high in the search is so you've got
to like actually look at the new app
section on the place or anyway let's say
you download it and it was malicious one
day gonna wake up it's gonna be off your
phone so Google will take care of that
for the most part but if you're one of
those to over download apps from Google
Play and from other sources then I would
recommend having an anti-virus app
because you're not gonna have that same
level protection when you're downloading
applications that aren't from the Google
Play Store and you know who knows what
developers or whoever's making that app
is putting in there so I'll recommend it
in that case but honestly from the whole
malware and antivirus perspective that I
don't really care about that all that
much I mean I don't have anti-virus on
my phone for that reason but what these
apps do offer you is a pretty cool I
mean it gives you the ability to track
your phone if you lose it or if it gets
stolen
when I say track mean a GPS location you
could send your phone secret text
message with your password that you set
up you know when you first download the
app that you know locks the phone screen
and prevent somebody from getting into
it if somebody switches out the SIM card
it can alert you right away and you can
do a whole bunch of things you know I
use the app called abbess which is an
anti-virus app that's for free
let me show you guys really quick so
it's this guy right here I use on my
Galaxy Nexus cuz you know if I ever lost
my phone or I got it stolen I'd be able
to track it you know and know exactly
where it is which is pretty cool to me
you can even set it to like send you a
text message every minute or every five
minutes telling you know where it is on
the map so if you kind of track the the
progress or the route it's taking but
anyway that's a cool feature that you
could have you can also you know have
things like web Shield which when you're
going in the browser and you're going on
certain websites it protects you from
you know those malicious websites which
aren't apps at all it protects from
those websites that you know may pose
this face book but reading reality it's
not Facebook so you mistakenly type in
your Facebook username and password and
before you know it your Facebook account
was hijacked so it is a good idea to
keep one of these guys but you know
honestly it's not that big of a threat
on Android you know the companies will
tell you that it is a bigger threat than
you know you want to believe but
basically doing that because they want
to make money but if they're a free app
and honest that's what I recommend APIs
is free and that's why I use it because
it's free on the computer it's also free
on Android and you know they're not
trying to get you know money out of you
there's you know offering a service
obviously they have ads and that's fine
by me but I really wouldn't pay for him
but anyway that's all I wanted to talk
about you know antivirus office Skiba is
my opinion on it that's pretty much it
for me this videos Dave Bombo com
