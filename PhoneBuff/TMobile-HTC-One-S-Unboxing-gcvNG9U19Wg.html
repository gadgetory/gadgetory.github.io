com and i'll be doing an unboxing for
the t-mobile HTC One S today and giving
you a short little walkthrough so go
ahead and open this guy up I haven't
opened it at all yet I just cut these
little labels so you're getting the
first look just like I am here's the
phone so let's go ahead and pull this
guy out I could see this little screen
cover showing you all the buttons and
whatnot here's the backup phone super
thin but let's go ahead and look at the
box you've got this thing right here
which has your instruction manual there
it is so all this t-mobile stuff your
instruction manual your warranty or
terms and conditions extra sim card if
you don't have one and what is this Oh
recycling and you have your USB cable
right here and your home charger so as
you can see there is no beats audio
headphones but the phone does Sport
beats as you see Beats Audio of course
get android google play all that good
stuff like a 4.3 inch super amoled
screen the Qualcomm s4 processor and
everything like that but I'm not here to
show you the box for you to show you the
phone so here it is obviously I don't
have to pop in the battery because the
battery's ready in here it isn't
removable so it's kind of like the
iphone in that sense i'll go ahead and
power this guy on so turned it on and
wait did I let me hold this again there
you go all right turned it on and let
you guys see the boot animation I'll go
ahead and remove this little sticker off
the front so there you go see that
beautiful qhd display it's a 960 x 540
cool little animation going I'm just
absolutely love the thinness of this
device of course team only has the grey
and blue version that on the black and
red but can't really complain about that
all right there you go the phone is
almost booted up so you can see is
pretty cool
Rick I'm going to be doing a comparison
video with some of the other phones at
the iphone on the Galaxy Nexus and what
whatever else I have at the moment and
just kind of give you guys a better idea
as far as the performance you could
expect from this guy so obviously have
an intern in my sim card so it says
emergency calls only go ahead unlock
this guy and go through a quick setup so
says English hit next what is the saying
says remove the back cover and enter a
sim card holder so it's telling us how
to do that um I'll skip that for right
now asking to uh if I want to sync my
data I'll just hit next right now and
next and agree of course agree it's
going to give you guys the walk that you
could expect when you get the phone so
those guys for the date stuff like that
because doesn't that doesn't have a sim
card and obviously no internet
connection yet because I haven't
connected my Wi-Fi I'll do all that
later just want to show you guys the
device so here you go cool little a
quick help guide that you have for the
notification bar tells you what it is
tells you how to press and hold on empty
space add a widget to drag apps over to
create a folder and to add things to the
launch bar so pretty cool if you want to
have quick tips enabled hey yes
obviously I don't really need them hit
no and there you go this is the device
you have five home screens as you can
see or try to say seven home screens and
you can just scroll through them like
that have that nice little 3d animation
as you guys can see and go ahead and it
the app launcher and see which apps come
included you can see a four oh one more
for tmobile something called game base
didn't mean to hit that but we have more
for me t mobile hotspot my t-mobile so
you can see you have a bunch of apps
here that are for t-mobile um different
from what you see on the international
version of the phone but overall that's
the quick walkthrough I'll be doing a
review full review on the phone a little
bit later and obviously like I said I'm
going to be doing a few comparisons but
that's it for this video unboxing this
