and in this video we'll be pinning the
iphone 4s which is the flagship phone
from apple or iOS against the Nokia
Lumia 900 on the right which is
obviously the flagship phone from
Windows Phone arguably the flash your
phone from Windows Phone so both devices
are offering almanor do a speed compared
to test starting with the blue tube test
then we'll be doing a browser test and
also app speed comparison so let me turn
both these guys on the same time power
buttons here on the right and here on
the top on the iphone so press it at the
same time so one two three hold it for a
few seconds there you go let these guys
load up while they're loading up I'll
let you guys know that they're both
running on the same Wi-Fi network and
also I cleared out the browser history
on both devices before it turned them
off so we're gonna get a nice even
comparison test on both these guys and
we'll really find out which one's faster
so what the Lumia 900 looks like it's
going to that little windows phone there
you go so uh the iphone 4s actually beat
out the Lumia 900 when it came to
loading it up I got the sim card error
on here um best cuz I don't have a sim
card but a split-second decision I mean
really the iphone 4s loaded up just a
half second before the Lumia 900 did and
I've done other tests before you know in
one test the Lumia 900 and then the
iphone 4 it for us will be a half a
second later sometimes we'll just tie
and sometimes it goes to the iphone 4s
this case you want to live for us but
really that's the tie arm we'll go ahead
and go to the next test which is the
ESPN app test so I'm a load of score
center right here in here so one two
three and I load it up first on the
iphone 4s this guy's still going and
that now it's done so obviously the
winner here is the iphone 4s well go
ahead and close it out so uh I'll just
close them out just for uh you know
comparison sake you know just in case
you guys are worried about that so
anyway we'll load up the next step which
is flixster so tap this guy and i'll hit
flixster 123 again the iphone 4s one i
gotta add to but it did load up
second before the Lumia we hit back out
of here close that guy out all right now
the next test will be the dictionary app
test so load up dictionary on both
devices one two three and this time the
Lumia 900 one so that when goes to the
Nokia so we'll go ahead and close this
guy out so so far the iphone one the
ESPN and the flixster top the dictionary
app went to the lumia next I followed up
is a wordpress so i have wordpress by
the same developer on both phones and
we'll go ahead and see which one goes up
first so 1 2 3 and the iphone 4s did
load it up first um it just loads up
this first part imma hit the actual my
website phone buff and see which one was
up first here so 1 2 3 and again the
iphone 4s one again so the wind
definitely goes to the iphone 4s here
and the last you know app i'll test i
will be the camera just to see the
Buddha or the elantra swimming speed of
the camera so we'll tap the camera the
same time so one two three and again the
iphone 4s did show us the capture screen
a little bit faster than Lumia 900 so
the wind does go to the iphone again so
from the app speeds you know the Lumia
only one and one which is the dictionary
the rest wants to the iphone boopsy like
I said you know the iphone type we won
but it's really close i call it a tie
just from my past experience but now
we'll go ahead and do the browser speed
test so open up the browser on both
phones like i said i did clear out the
history so first website will visit is
going to be of course foam buff calm so
going off comm and foam buff calm on
here alright so i'll go ahead and tap go
at the same time one two three and out
both devices are off looks like the
iphone has a lead the status bar is
right here on the bottom for the lumia
i'll let you know as soon as one finish
is there you go the iphone 4s is done
bloom and I are still going you can see
I everything's loaded up on the iphone
this guy looks like most of us done but
it seems to be loading something up in
the background but uh for this case the
iphone 4s does get the win we're going
to do a multi-touch test to see how
smooth the multi-touch is on here so
i'll go ahead and nob we'll just zoom in
on this picture / air so zoom in and out
really really smoothing the iphone you
know it's been smooth for a long time
with iOS i'll go ahead and do the same
thing on the lumia so same area again
really really smooth on here too so i
definitely both of them have a smooth
multi-touch let's go ahead and not do a
scroll test so i'll go ahead and scroll
I think I clicked on something here
let's go back really quick whoops
alright so while that's loading all
let's go ahead and scroll in here so I'm
just going to scroll down and you can
see no little check boards so everything
loads up really quickly let me zoom in
do the same thing Evan England seems to
be loading up really quickly will be the
same thing on here first we'll do the
pan out or the zoom so you can see it
does it did I it is loading up things up
like as we go a little bit right there
so it's not as fast as iphone in that
regard will go and resume and do the
same thing when we zoom in doesn't seem
to be an issue so for scrolling the
iphone 4s does seem to be a little bit
faster go and load up another website
will load up let's do I don't know CNN
com so CNN com CNN com and that tap go
at the same time I think arrest already
loaded it up and followed by the Lumia
900 it looks like the alerted of
different versions this one has a
picture and this one has a smaller
picture so if anything is sure took
longer on the iphone 4s but I for still
one so of course the wind goes together
for us there again and last website will
load let's load up a NFL com really
quick and we'll go and see they're gonna
load up the mobile site and then we'll
do the full set after so we get a full
idea of how fastest browser is a one two
three
um again that one was close but this guy
didn't load up the mobile site loaded up
the WEP version we're just got loaded up
the actual mobile version 60m de NFL so
what we'll scroll down to the bottom and
I will swell on to the bottom here and
now let's go to the full site so desktop
and full site one two three all right so
it looks like the iphone 4s has a lead
the Lumia 900 sixty percent done I for
us is now done um there's a little bar
loading in the status bar at the little
circle if you guys see so it is loading
some things up in the background but now
it's gone Lumia hunters done overall the
wind does go to the iphone 4s but it's a
lot closer than I you know you'd believe
because a lot of times it's loading
stuff up in the background with that
little circle up in the notification bar
where it doesn't show on the Lumia 900 I
just shows up in the bar so anyway um
that's the a speed comparison test I
mean are the speed comparison um overall
the iphone 4s is the clear winner here
um you know when it comes to boot up it
will say that I apps fees were faster on
the iphone 4s and the browser was
unanimously faster on the iphone 4s so
that's pretty much it for me in this
