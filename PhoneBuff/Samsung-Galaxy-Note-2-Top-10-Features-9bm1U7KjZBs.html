Bombo calm and in this video I will be
doing your typical review on the Samsung
Galaxy Note 2 but I decided you know
what there's a whole bunch of great
reviews out there already and also the
phone's been out for quite some time
both internationally and here in the
States
so I wanted to do something a little bit
different so in this video we're
actually taking a look at what we think
are the top 10 features on the Samsung
Galaxy Note 2 I really hope you guys
enjoyed the video and with that said
let's go ahead and get right into it the
first top feature is probably the most
obvious of them all and that's the big
and beautiful 5.5 inch HD Super AMOLED
display having a screen this big means
that you get to see more of your great
content on the screen at once
for example the keyboard comes with an
extra number oh that I actually find to
be really convenient and having more
icons on the screen at once also
translates into less scrolling through
the pages and pages of apps you may have
not to mention watching videos on
YouTube or just a video player in
general is just downright amazing and
the browsing experience on the note 2 is
unmatched by any other smartphone I've
ever seen top feature number 2 aside
from its giant screen size the next
thing that really differentiates the
note 2 from other smartphones is the
s-pen the s-pen isn't your typical
capacitive stylus that merely replaces
your finger instead it's a whole
different method of input with over 250
different levels of pressure sensitivity
the s-pen gives you a super accurate
input option not just that it gives you
the option to hover which can do things
ranging from previewing what you're
looking at - opening drop-down menus
within the browser
and because the s-pen has a button you
get yet another way to interact with the
phone screen letting you access things
with a quick gesture or even letting you
take an exact screenshot while holding
the button down and because the s-pen
detaches from the note samsung included
the S Pen keeper option which alerts you
when you walk away without reattaching
it which can help prevent you from
losing it and sure while it may not be
useful probably one of my favorite
features about the s-pen is how it
interacts differently with the
lockscreen compared to your finger if
that doesn't sell you on the s-pen then
I don't know what will the third top
feature goes hand-in-hand with the
pan and that's s note which I think is
one of the best if not the best notepad
available on any smartphone with s note
you have a whole bunch of different
input options ranging from the stroke
type to the color of it you can choose
from a variety of backgrounds to draw on
but more importantly you have features
like formula match which helps you solve
math problems which by the way I really
wish I had in school has shape match
which helps you draw your shapes nice
and neatly and ideas sketch which can
help you cheat and draw something
amongst other things
and a whole bunch more and with the S
Pen only mode you can be sure that you
won't draw things on accident with your
palm while you're using the S Pen
because it'll only detect the S Pen
itself top feature number four has to be
the performance the Galaxy Note 2 puts
out with its 1.6 gigahertz Exynos
quad-core processor coupled with a
whopping 2 gigabytes of RAM the Galaxy
Note 2 just flies it handles pretty much
everything you throw at it without any
hiccups this is because not only there's
a note to have amazing hardware the
software side of things holds its own
with Android jellybean speed
optimizations thanks to its great
performance capabilities the fifth top
feature on the note 2 is its
multitasking with features like multi
window which lets you use two apps at
once pop-up browser and pop-up lays
picture-in-picture video multitasking on
the Galaxy Note 2 is unlike any other
smartphone top feature number six on the
galaxy note 2 is its one-handed use now
the how one may have you scratching
ahead a bit but the only reason we're
even saying it's a top feature is
because Samsung made a whole bunch of
optimizations to help accommodate for
one-handed use a few examples are the
calculator and keyboard which both
reduce in size and shift to desired edge
of the screen making them really easy to
reach also in the browser you can simply
slide your finger along the side of the
screen
to zoom in and out so while technically
one-handed use isn't as good as your
average smartphone on the note 2 it's
actually a little bit better than most
people think
speaking of software optimizations the
seven top feature on the note 2 is
Samsung's TouchWiz UI not only is a user
interface optimized to work with the
s-pen it comes with extra features like
smart stay and smart rotation which use
the note two's front-facing camera to
control the screen settings TouchWiz
also features Wireless toggles in the
notification bar and comes with a host
of motion controls that are unique to
Samsung devices overall Samsung's
TouchWiz
you eye just adds value to the user
experience top feature number eight has
got to be both the 1.9 megapixel front
face and the 8 megapixel rear camera on
the galaxy note 2 not only do both
cameras deliver great image and video
quality there are a lot of options you
could actually play with like slow
motion and/or fast motion video effects
and a bunch of different filters you
could apply when taking pictures which I
imagine would be a instagramers best
friend with its big display high quality
camera and powerful performance
capabilities you wouldn't think that the
9th top feature would be battery life
but believe me it is the battery on the
note 2 just lasts all day long this is
partly because with the big phone comes
a big 3100 milliamp battery but the
other part is again Samsung's
optimizations with features like power
saver and not to mention the
energy-efficient Super AMOLED display
the final feature top feature number 10
is that with the Galaxy Note 2 you're
not just getting an undersized tablet or
an oversized smartphone you're getting
some of the best of both worlds meaning
you may just be able to consolidate
these two separate devices into one
which makes things and life a little bit
more convenient ok guys that's it for me
