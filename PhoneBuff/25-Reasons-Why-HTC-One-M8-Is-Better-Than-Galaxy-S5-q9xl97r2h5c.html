you by $6.00 shirts what's up guys david
here from fumble fan the Samsung Galaxy
s5 and the HTC One m8 or arguably to the
best Android smartphones out right now
so in this two-part video series we're
going comparing the two but we're not
gonna be doing your typical comparison
and instead like we usually do here in
the channel we're gonna be doing it foam
of style where we look at 25 reasons why
each of these phones can be considered
better than the other and that way after
watching both videos you'll have a much
better idea as to which one is better
for you let's go ahead and get right
into it
reason number one the HTC One has a
beautiful all-metal build that just
screams quality everything from the ones
unibody design to the way it's cold when
you pick it up in the morning makes it
feel like a premium device which is
something you can't really say about the
Galaxy s5s more plastic materials - in
addition to the build quality the curved
design on the back of the one makes it
slightly more ergonomic fitting a bit
more comfortably and naturally in the
palm of your hand 3 speaking to the back
you notice that there's not one but two
cameras on the m8 the second of which is
used for recording depth information
allowing for things like post capture
refocusing and a host of other pretty
cool effects for while the m8 s camera
has a lesser amount of total pixels each
of his pixels or while HTC likes to call
ultra pixels are bigger and therefore
bringing more light to the sensor
resulting in better-looking photos in
low light conditions reason number five
but lo liabilities can only take you so
far so HTC equipped the new one with
dual LED flashes which together give you
better and more natural-looking light
than the single LED found on the galaxy
s5 6 with HTC Zoe you can take a brush
out of up to 20 photos and continue to
record a full on video at the same time
but maybe best of all Zoe captures a few
photos before you even press the shutter
button to help make sure you don't lose
any of those Kodak moments due to a slow
reaction time 7 like it or not we live
in a world where her selfies are a thing
and with the HTC One you can capture
those selfies in high resolution with
better low-light performance
on the MH five megapixel front-facing
camera eight while this one can
ultimately come down to personal
preference most people agree that sense
six on the HTC one offers a better
looking or at the very least a more
consistent looking UI then TouchWiz does
on the Galaxy S five nine and maybe more
importantly the Sense UI on the m8 is
less cluttered than TouchWiz on the s5
making things like finding a certain
setting to switching camera modes a bit
easier reason number ten probably the
future that the HTC One is best known
for the m8 has dual front-facing stereo
speakers which not only delivers
significantly louder sound in the Galaxy
S five they also deliver much better
quality sound as well making the s5
single rear speaker sound almost tinny
in comparison eleven if you accidentally
drop and crack the m8 screen HTC offers
a free one-time repair for customers
that are within the first six months of
their ownership twelve another HTC
advantage is the fact that some of the
HTC exclusive apps are on the Play Store
which means HTC will be able to update
and improve them quickly without having
to do a full on system update that
typically takes months to roll out due
to carrier delays thirteen an example of
one of those apps is the HTC gallery
which has a unique image match feature
where you can match an image to other
similar images on your phone and create
a whole new album from the matching
images easily 14 unlike the Galaxy s5
the HTC One has a built-in FM radio
which can be used with headphones to
listen to your favorite stations without
the need or use of an internet
connection which can come in handy when
you don't have data reception or or
trying to save on data usage reason
number 15 with motion launched you can
pick the HTC One up and one straight
into a variety of things like your
homescreen blinkfeed
or even the camera with the simple
gesture making getting straight into
what you want on your phone a lot faster
and more efficient 16 when you receive a
call on the m8 you can simply lift it to
you're here to automatically answer the
call without ever having to physically
touch the screen 17 and thankfully you
can set the e-ring volume to
automatically lower when you pick the
one up so that way you don't have to
risk blasting your ears with those
powerful boom sound speakers but you can
also set the m82 the opposite
where the ring volume gradually
increases whenever the m8 detects that
it's in your pocket or purse reducing
the chances of you missing a call 18 if
you ever happen to run low on storage
space on the m8 you can go into the
settings and use the make more space
feature that allows you to clear cache
delete apps and manage media all from
one convenient location 19 both the
galaxy s5 and the HTC One offers some
sort of basic cloud backup option but
with HTC backup the ma takes this one
step further storing everything from
your home screen layouts and blinkfeed
sources to text messages in call history
so if you ever needed to do a factory
reset or replace your m8 you can easily
restore nearly everything back to the
way it was which can save hours of
set-up time reason number 20 evidenced
by the phone Bob style speed test we
conducted while the HTC One and the
Galaxy S five have the same processor
the m8 has been shown to be faster time
and time again with a generally snappier
and more responsive experience 21 if
you're the type of person who buys their
phones at full retail price it's worth
mentioning that depending on where you
get your phones from the HTC One could
be on average 20 to 30 dollars cheaper
than the galaxy s5 22 but the bigger
difference is what you get even when
you're at the same price point for
example on a standard two-year contract
in the US both phones run for roughly
$200 the difference is the HTC One comes
with 32 gigabytes of storage whereas the
galaxy s5 only comes with 16 making the
HTC one a better value from a storage
standpoint 23 since both of these phones
are running Android both give you
insight into the way you use the
internet on your phone but the HTC One
takes this one step further and also
gives you insight into your calls and
messages giving you a better sense of
how you use everything that your carrier
may be charging you for 24 while the
flap on the Galaxy s5s charging port
provides an advantage that you'll hear
about in the Galaxy s5s version of this
video it does come with a drawback in
that it can be annoying to open and
close every time you want to charge the
phone which is something you won't have
to worry about on the HTC One
alright we're finally here reason number
25 many of us use our smart phones to
stay connected to the world around us
and with HTC blinkfeed the m8 makes it
easier to do with
beautifully aggregating your social
media accounts like Facebook Twitter and
Instagram with your own hand-picked
media sources from the thousands
available all in one convenient feed
which can keep you entertained for hours
on end alright that about wraps up the
HTC One version of this video so if you
haven't already I check out the Galaxy
s5s version as well which will be
entertaining somewhere on this screen or

asking me about these shirts I wear in
some of my videos like this one or this

their name these shirts cost just $6 so

good deal and help support the channel
