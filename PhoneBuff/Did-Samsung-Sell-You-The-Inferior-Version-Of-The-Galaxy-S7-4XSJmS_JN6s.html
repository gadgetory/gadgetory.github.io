live in the US and you bought the galaxy
s7 like you may not know this but
Samsung sold you an inferior version of
this phone and this is despite charging
you the same amount of money that are
charging other people in other countries
for the Federation now I know some of
you guys may be sitting there thinking
like what are you talking about Dave I
live in the u.s. I got the galaxy s7 and
it's a good phone in fact you yourself
on Twitter said that you thought I had
the best Hardware on any smart phone in
all the 2016 and yeah that's true okay
the galaxy s7 is a good phone in fact
it's a great phone wherever you buy it
but that doesn't change the fact that
Samsung is young an inferior version of
it here in the US along with a few other
countries like China and Japan so how
exactly is the US version of the galaxy
s7 worse than the global version which
is sold pretty much everywhere else
there are a couple things actually and
the first is performance so those of you
follow fumbles know that we do
performance tests that's kind of our
thing and we tested the US version of
the galaxy s7 against the global version
we found that not only is it slower and
initially loading up applications but
it's also significantly worse than
keeping those applications ready for you
in the background which overall equates
to slower performance now there are two
different chipsets being used so the US
version has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820
chip whereas the global version that
sold everywhere else has an extra notes
88-90 chip that's made by samsung itself
and you know at first glance you would
think like okay well maybe the process
of difference is the reason why one
phone is slower I can mean that makes
sense but it turns out that's actually
not the case later on when we tested
other Android phones with the same
Qualcomm chip those phones not only
perform better than the US version of
the galaxy i7 but they also perform
better at least some of them performs
better than the global version with
Samsung's own Exynos chip so like
clearly the hardware wasn't the problem
right the chipset difference wasn't the
problem it was really that Samsung just
didn't optimize the u.s. galaxy s7 as
well as they did the Exynos version now
if you really wanted to you could make
an excuse for Samsung and say like well
they had two different chipsets to worry
about and obviously they were going to
put the emphasis on their own in-house
chip in fact there are more familiar
with that chip so like it just makes
sense that it performed better on the
device band the Qualcomm chip but here's
the problem with the argument guess who
is being exclusive manufacturing partner
for Qualcomm to make
dragon a 20s who won the contract that
some analysts say was worth over a
billion dollars to make this afternoon a
24 Qualcomm it was Samson okay so they
were familiar they were very familiar
with the stature in a twenty because
they were the one literally making it so
like you would think like you would
think that Samson would take some of
that profit take some of that knowledge
about the chip and make sure that the
Snapdragon 820 on the US variant of the
galaxy s7 performed really really well
better than any other Android phone out
there when in fact it's the opposite and
like it doesn't make sense to me but
maybe performance isn't your thing right
now everybody has the need for speed
everybody wants a sports car now if
every cares about you know zero to 50
times some people just want to carve
that gets you to point A to point B and
they want to do it in a very fuel
efficient manner here's the thing the US
version the galaxy s7 also has worse
battery life so there's publications
online that did tests on both versions
of the galaxy s7 and they found that the
u.s. variant of the galaxy s7 had
battery life that was anywhere between
like 22 up to 70% less efficient than
the global counterpart but that's a lot
I will say a big part of the difference
here is due to the chipset but at the
same time optimization was a factor
since other Android phones that same
Qualcomm chip performed better than the
US version of the galaxy s7 so you live
in the u.s. you buy Galaxy a7 for the
same price as anybody else in the rest
of the world and you're getting worse
performance and you're getting worse
battery life like you think that would
be as if they wanted to add insult to
injury it's all they care you're both
you have to deal with it starts right
when you get the phone you get this box
on the International Version there's a
nice little magnetic clasp that you know
closes elegantly and on the US version
the box has this little paper tab
instead and I'm not trying to make a big
deal out of locks it's not a big deal
you get the phone out of the box and you
never see the box again but like it's
the principle of it right like it's
almost like the Samsung was just looking
at these two different versions at s7
they're like you know what for the
global version that we saw everywhere
else we're going to make sure we pay
attention to detail and put this nice
little magnetic clasp on there yeah that
would be nice but the US version and
let's put a little paper tab that you
know a little cheap version who cares
and then you pull the phone out of the
box okay okay wow this is a nice phone
right and it is and you turn it around
and boom what do you see you see a big
old tramp stamp logo on the back
your phone okay this doesn't happen on
international versions and it just
wouldn't happen like in going back to
the car analogy right imagine you buy
your car and before you drive it off a
lot feels like hey hold on hold on let
us spray paint our logo real quick on
the back of your car like and just
wouldn't happen so you turn on the phone
and what are you greeted with the first
thing you see is a bunch of carrier apps
that you just don't want and yes you can
disable them but even when you disable
them they're not completely off your
phone they're always going to take up a
little bit of your storage space and
then to top it off right like to top it
all off when a new version of Android
comes out with all the new features and
bug fixes guess what you're not going to
get updated to the latest version until
like months after everyone else
yeah sure other Android manufacturers do
the same thing with carriers right they
have all the bloatware and tramp stamp
on there but we're talking about Samsung
right this is the biggest Android
manufacturer and their biggest
competitor and Apple doesn't do that
stuff like it doesn't matter if you buy
an iPhone in California or if you buy in
Australia I've done both the unboxing
experience is the same you don't get
tramp stamps you don't get carrier
bloatware and updates roll out around
the same time for everyone even Google
they have an exclusive with Verizon this
year on with the pink school but that
phone doesn't have a chance up on it
doesn't have carrier bloatware so what's
Samsung's Excuse
and you know when you add it all up
together right like the slower
performance the lower battery life the
delayed updates and all the other
carrier BS like it's just hard to not
feel like Samsung gave the US the short
end of the stick when it came to the
galaxy s7 and honestly I'm afraid that
they're going to do the same exact thing
again with a Galaxy s8 unless we do
something about it and what can we do
let's talk about it right let's talk
about the issue on Facebook tweet
Samsung and tell them that you want an
equal phone for an equal price tag me in
your post I'm at Bob of pretty much
everywhere
I think if enough people know about the
issue and Samsung knows that people know
about the issue they'll do the right
thing
they'll step up to the plate and they'll
make sure that they offer the same great
experience that they're offering to
other people in other countries to
people on the US eco phone for an equal
price that's what we asked for anyways
that is it for me in this video thank
you guys for watching and as always I'll
be keeping it real with you in the very
next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
