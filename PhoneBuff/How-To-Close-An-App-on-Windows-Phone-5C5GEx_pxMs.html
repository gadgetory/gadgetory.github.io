I'm doing a quick video on how to close
out an app on Windows Phone so a lot of
people think they're closing app when
they're hitting this Center key or the
start key and it takes it to the home
screen we're not actually closing the
app now with the browser's kind of hard
to demonstrate because Windows Phone
keeps the webpage you're last on you
need to turn the phone off and turn it
back on but I'll go to demonstrate how
to close out closing out with a
calculator so I'll go ahead and type
some numbers in here and press the start
key or the HOME key and you would think
that the app is closed
but if you press and hold the back key
you'll see that it's still open running
in the background so if I go back to it
it still has my number safe so that was
me multitasking but if I actually go to
calculator from here it's still going to
be it still has my data in the
calculator which tells me that the app
has been closed yet so what you want to
do is press back instead of the home key
I'll go in and press back now jump right
back into the calculator and you'll see
that the data is actually gone I'll go
to the multitasking view really quick
and you'll see that the calculator is no
longer in my list of recent apps so
that's pretty much it so just going to
have it oppressing this back key instead
of the start key when you actually want
to close an app out if you want to keep
it open for later use like the
calculator if you're going back and
forwards calculating stuff press the
start key so that we don't actually
close it accidentally but that's it for
me this is David from both comm thank
you for watching the video and don't
forget to visit Bombo comm for more cell
phone news reviews and how to's thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
