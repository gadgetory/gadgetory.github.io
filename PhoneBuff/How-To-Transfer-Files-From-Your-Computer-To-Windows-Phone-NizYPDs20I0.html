and in this video I will show you how to
transfer files from your computer to
your Windows Phone so I'm going to show
you how to transfer music pictures and
video through the Zune player and also
have it transfer over your office
documents through SkyDrive so I'll go
ahead and open up my office really quick
and show you that I only have six
documents in here and I'm going to add a
whole bunch more just to show you how it
works so I'll go ahead and hop on my
computer and show you each method for
doing this
alright so the first thing I'm going to
show you how to do is transfer over
media files to your computer via these
zune software so go ahead and open up
Xun on your computer as you can see I
have it right over here and connect your
Windows Phone so I went ahead and
connected my Windows Phone and you can
see it recognizes it as the HD HD seven
so whatever type of Windows Phone you
have your zoom player should recognize
it
once you connect it once you've done
that you'll be able to transfer over
your pictures songs or videos over into
your library so I'll go ahead and
transfer over a song that's not
currently in my library from My
Documents so I'm gonna go to My
Documents where my music and this song
right here is currently not in my media
library so I will go ahead and drag it
and drop it right in to my media library
on the simpler you can see it's been
added as saying one items were found and
adding media now if I wanted to sync it
with my phone I just drag on this guy
and drop it right on that phone icon so
I drop it says added one song
successfully so that's pretty much it I
mean the same process works if you're
adding a song a picture or a video a
media file is basically a media file but
let's go ahead and show you what happens
when you try to add a document so for
example let's say I'm trying to a how to
word document that I have right here
titled how to so let's say I'm trying to
add this guy into my Windows Phone I try
to drag it over to my library and you
can see it's not going to let me it has
that little Center icon letting me know
that it's not going to work I drop it
nothing happens so the way you actually
sync your office document with your
Windows Phone is open up your web
browser and go to W
we W SkyDrive so skydrive.com hit enter
it loads up so go ahead and enter in
your Windows Live ID and your password
so I'll go ahead and type in my ID
really quick go ahead and type in my
password and login once I've logged in
you're taken to this screen and from
here you have the option to add new
documents or our office arguments so
let's say for example I wanted to add
that word document that I'll shine at
earlier I'm just going to top add files
right here and for example let's go back
to that article tap it and you can see
it's being uploaded now when I hit open
so it's being uploaded to my SkyDrive so
I'm going to open up a few are out a few
more so just add let's see let's open up
our add a whole bunch of these so I'm
holding ctrl on my keyboard and I'm
clicking on them so that way it
highlights multiple at the same time hit
open you can see it's uploading all of
them it's done and this should refresh
in a second there you go so not that
it's been added to my SkyDrive file I
just have to make sure it syncs all my
windows phone so let's go ahead and go
back to the phone alright so we're back
on the phone first thing I'll do is show
you that the song that we transferred
over did indeed come on the phone so
there it is 3p as you can see um like I
said it's going to work whether you're
transferring a song a video or a picture
and let's go ahead and go to the office
app and see if the documents we uploaded
transferred over so what you're going to
do is go under locations on your office
app and tap on SkyDrive and as we can
see the word documents that are uploaded
to SkyDrive have sync with the phone and
they show up right here and again this
works regardless of whether you're
transferring a word document an Excel
document or a PowerPoint document but
that's pretty much it this is Dave
