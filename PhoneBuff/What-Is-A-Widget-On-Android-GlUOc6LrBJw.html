calm and in this video i want to talk to
you about what a widget is on android
how they're different from being
shortcuts and also how they're
beneficial to having on your home screen
so first thing is what is a widget a
widget is a program or an application
that actually runs on your home screen
without actually having to be opened up
or attached to an application so for
example i have this weather widget right
here which it tells me the weather
outside of my or in my city also gives
me at a time which is pretty cool but it
doesn't it's not necessarily attached to
any application other than being the
woods yourself of course if I tap on I
could get more functions such as my
five-day forecast but then there are
some widgets that are actually attached
to applications so for example the score
Center or ESPN score center widget will
tell me the scores of the game
as they're happening but if I wanted
more information I can just tap on it
and it will actually open up the ESPN
score Center app so in that case it is
tied to an application but this power
controls widget for example lets me
control my wireless toggles without
having to actually go to the settings so
for example if we wanted to turn
bluetooth on and turn GPS off I can do
so without actually having to go all the
way to settings
scrolling all the way to the wireless
controls and you know turning them on
and off from here so definitely a lot
more convenient having a widget on your
home screen instead of having to go to
the settings I'll going to show you some
other widgets that I have my home screen
just so you guys get a better idea as
far as how widgets work this is a music
widget so you have a music player on
your phone that you can open up you know
I can open this guy up by scrolling over
to music and tapping it right here and
it opens up my music player but instead
I don't have to go through that stuff
with all I gotta do is swipe over to my
home screen that has my music widget and
I can play this song right now
by pressing play I can pause it I can
skip to the next song and so on and so
forth so pretty cool functionality to
have makes it a lot more convenient some
other widgets are you know example is
YouTube I can look through my
subscriptions by flicking through videos
if I find one
I could tap on and watch it if I wanted
to make a note for myself I can make it
a little post-it with this with color
note app which is a you know would you
that can remind me of what I want of
course I can resize widgets with Ice
Cream Sandwich so I can make it you know
smaller bag gets tacked to right next to
each other I also have a widget for my
bookmarks so let's say for example I
wanted to go straight to a my favorite
website you know let's say phonebook
comm right here I don't have to actually
open up my web browser and type in phone
book or go through my bookmarks here I
can just tap my homescreen I'll go
straight to the website I want another
example is a dictionary widget let's say
I'm trying to look up the word dog or
the definition of it I could do it right
from my home screen and it'll load the
dictionary app right away with the word
I search instead of me having to go
through you know my home screen or
through my apple√≠s and tapping
dictionary and going through here and
then typing dog and then hitting Enter
so definitely a lot faster but that's
pretty much you know what widgets are
hopefully that gives you a better idea
as far as how we just work and you know
the differences between them such as the
ones that are attached to applications
like the ESPN score Center one the ones
that are completely standalone which are
like the power controls and you know the
music app which if I wanted to go to my
music player app I could just tap it and
get the full app to so which is you know
could really offer you a lot on your
home screen and make things a lot easier
and more convenient um it's pretty much
