waking up one morning checking your
phone and seeing an email from your bank
saying that you got hit with the fee
after a wire transfer that you didn't
authorize emptied out all of the money
in your accounts or imagine getting a
message from your friend asking you why
you would post that really embarrassing
and straight-up disgusting video link on
Facebook even though it wasn't you like
what would you do now the thought of
either of these things happening or a
number of other things that I have to do
can be scary and you know while
something like this may or may not ever
happen to you as the saying goes it's
better to be safe than sorry so today
I'm gonna be sharing with you some of
the main steps you can take to help
avoid getting hacked now this isn't a
guide to becoming 100% hack proof since
there's really no such thing as being
100% hack proof if a hacker has the
means and they have the motivation to
hack you then guess what they probably
can but if you use these three main
steps along with some of the bonus steps
that I'll talk about at the end of the
video
it'll significantly reduce the odds of
it happening to you and it'll put you
may be ahead of 99% of people out there
so we'll start off with the first step
to avoid getting hacked and arguably the
most important step which is to fix your
crappy passwords now like before you
roll your eyes and think here we go
again I've heard this before
just stop and listen because I've talked
to a lot of people about their password
security and nine times out of 10 people
are doing it wrong they're either using
weak passwords that are easily guessable
or more common they're using the same
password across multiple accounts now
the problem with this is all it takes is
for any one of those accounts to get
hacked for all of your other accounts
using that password to get hacked as
well we've already seen hundreds of
company databases get breached over the
years with millions of email addresses
and passwords having been stolen so what
should you do well the first thing is to
make sure you're using a different
password for each of your accounts like
not just a different password for your
emails and your bank accounts but a
different password for each and every
single account that way if a hacker gets
one of your passwords
it'll only affect that one account and
not all of your other ones and don't
just stick with the minimum password
requirements
either okay you want to go beyond the
minimum making your password as long as
possible and as random as possible
because you have to remember that it's
not actually a human that you're trying
to keep from guessing your password it's
a computer and unlike humans computers
are really good at guessing passwords
with some computer clusters capable of
guessing up to 350 billion passwords per
second meaning a standard eight
character password even if you're using
numbers and symbols can be cracked in
less than six hours now you may be
thinking like okay this makes sense and
all but I just can't do it all right
there's no way that I can remember a
random 40 character password let alone
remember a different one for each and
every single one of my accounts it's
impossible and look I get you right I
was guilty of using the same password
across some of my accounts too but the
thing is nowadays you don't actually
have to remember all the passwords
yourself that's what a password manager
is for the one I've been using is
dashlane who are actually cool enough to
sponsor this segment of the video which
does all of the remembering for you that
way you can have a different password
for each and every one of your accounts
without having to worry about memorizing
them I personally don't know most of my
passwords and I don't need to because
all my passwords are securely stored in
dashlane using the strongest encryption
technology available all I need to know
is my master password which you first
set up after you download the app that
gives you access to all the rest of your
passwords of course just because you
don't have to know all your passwords
doesn't mean that they can be just
anything right like they still have to
be long and they still have to be random
and the best way to go about making
these strong passwords is using the
password generator right within dashlane
itself you can adjust how long you want
your password to be whether or not it
uses characters and it'll even rate them
on a scale of 0 to 100 letting you know
how strong they are which you know makes
the whole process of going back and
changing all your old passwords a heck
of a lot easier now helping you generate
and remember all your passwords is great
but my favorite thing about dashlane is
it actually makes logging into your apps
and websites a lot faster and just so
much more convenient with autofill
dashlane automatically fills in your
username and passwords for you so you
don't need to go back and look them up
yourself and in
the only thing you need is to enter in
that master password or even better if
you're on your phone you can just use
your fingerprint so you don't have to
type in anything not your username not
your password it's seriously amazing and
you know once you start using it for
things like filling in your address or
your credit card information
you really can't live without it now the
app is actually available for free but
if you sign up using the link down below
in the description you'll automatically
get a free month of their dashlane
premium service which includes
additional features like secure account
backup where should anything happen to
your phone you'll always have a copy to
restore and the ability to sync your
passwords across all of your devices
premium is just a few bucks a month and
if you end up liking it you can use the
code down below in the description to
get 10% off of your purchase so check it
out but regardless of whether you stick
with the free version or you go with the
premium version just make sure that the
password you use as your master password
is a strong one okay look I know this is
obvious but I figured I might as well
say it use a strong password make sure
it's one that you've never used anywhere
else and only use it with dashlane and
most importantly make sure that you
never ever forget it because if you do
you could end up locking yourself out of
your accounts like the point of all this
is to keep the bad guys out not you so
take the time to memorize that password
and if you have to print it out and put
it somewhere safe got it
good alright so once you've fixed your
passwords the next step to avoid getting
hacked is to prepare for the day that a
hacker manages to get one of your
passwords you may be thinking like wait
a minute
what did it be game over if a hacker has
your password and up yeah it could be
unless you have something called two
step or two-factor authentication which
you can enable in the settings of most
sites with two-factor authentication
like the name implies you'll need two
different factors to be able to log in
to your account the first factor is your
password or something you know with the
second factor being a unique code that's
sent either to your phone number or
generated on your device which is
something you have without both factors
a hacker won't be able to get into your
account making that password they got
somewhat useless especially since you're
using a different password for every
account so you really really want to
make sure that you enable this and any
account that lets you but especially for
your password manager and for your email
for obvious reasons now the most popular
method of 2-step authentication is
having a text message with a unique code
sent to your phone number and you know
for the most part this makes your
accounts a heck of a lot more secure
than not having it however it doesn't
mean that you still can't get hacked
remember there's no such thing as being
100% hack proof and the problem with
having a unique code sent to your phone
number is that your phone number itself
can be stolen a hacker can simply call
your cell phone carrier pretending to be
you and tell them that they lost their
phone and need a new one activated which
means that they would get those codes
sent directly to them now hopefully you
have any pin on your account which
should help prevent a hacker from being
able to do this but again if a hacker
has the motivation then they can hack
you so like maybe the first
representative area carrier will deny
the hacker access because they don't
have that pin code but what about the
second representative or what about the
third what if a hacker is willing to try
100 different times do you trust that a
hundred different representatives that
your carrier will all be strict with
requiring a pin you would hope so but
you know I wouldn't count on it so a
more secure method of two-factor
authentication is to use an
Authenticator app that generates the
codes on your device itself whether
that's on your phone or one of your
other devices and the reason why using
an Authenticator app is more secure is
the codes they generates aren't sent
through the internet or through your
phone numbers so they can't technically
be hijacked and really the only way a
hacker can get these codes is if they
physically steal your device from you
which obviously is gonna be a lot harder
to do and you know if you're not a high
profile celebrity or like a politician
or something usually a hacker is gonna
go through all that trouble but I do
have to warn you that there is a
downside to using Authenticator apps
which is if you lose a device that the
app is installed on you might get locked
out of your accounts so to be safe and
to make sure that this doesn't happen to
you again you're trying to keep the bad
guys out now yourself print out backup
codes for any of the accounts that you
use an Authenticator app with and just
like your master password keep it
somewhere safe ideally in a different
location all right so you fixed your
passwords and you enable two-factor
authentication and you know you're
feeling pretty good but we're not done
yet
the third step to avoid getting hacked
is being smart about the Wi-Fi networks
you connect to now generally I'd advise
against connecting to any
secure our untrusted Wi-Fi networks
because you never really know if there's
a hacker monitoring them meaning those
free hot spots at your coffee shop at
the airport at a hotel or even at the
Apple Store should be avoided of course
in life sometimes you're gonna need to
use one of these Wi-Fi networks I mean
like sitting in an airport all day
without YouTube would just be torture so
in those situations you want to make
sure that you're using a VPN a VPN or a
virtual private network is an app that
allows you to access the Internet in a
way that is more private and more secure
it does this by using what is called a
secure tunnel that encrypts everything
you sent to and received back from a
server and the reason why this is
important is because if there's a hacker
who's monitoring all the data is going
through a Wi-Fi network that you're
connected to when they see your data
it'll be encrypted and it would just be
a bunch of scrambled up nonsense that
they can't do anything with which you
know is a lot better than them having
something like I don't know your user
name and password so use a VPN any time
you're on an untrusted Network otherwise
you might just give away the farm okay
so those are the three main steps you
can take to help avoid getting hacked
but for those of you who stuck around
and for those of you who are looking for
even more security here are the bonus
steps that I promised you earlier so
step number four is to turn off
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on your phone
whenever you're not using them Bluetooth
especially has been known to be
vulnerable to a hackers attack even when
it's not connected to a device so when
you're in a public space and you're not
using it just turn bluetooth off step
number five is to avoid falling for
phishing scams if you ever get an email
or a text message from an unknown
contact claiming to be something like
your bank and asking you to log in using
a link just don't do it okay because
there's a good chance that the link is
to a website that looks like your bank
but is only meant to steal your login
information step number six is to use a
strong pin code on your phone like don't
be lazy and use the four-digit code I
know you're used to it and I know it's
convenient but that's why you have a
fingerprint scanner
in fact just go with an alphanumeric
password to really make sure your phone
is more secure step number seven is
related to step number six in that you
should never give that pin code or
password to anybody and whenever you're
in public make sure you only use a
fingerprint scanner or an iris scanner
because you never really know if there's
a hacker standing over your shoulder
watching you put in your PIN
code step number eight is to hide
sensitive information from showing up on
your lock screen you can do this in the
settings of most phones and it's
important because in case your phone is
ever lost or stolen you don't want a
hacker to be able to easily read your
2-step authentication codes or emails
without having to first unlock your
phone step number nine is to only
download apps and games from trusted
sources like the Google Play Store or
Apple's App Store
since these apps are scanned and vetted
by Apple and Google for any security
risks that perhaps you download from
other sources might just be infected
with and finally step number ten is to
simply update your phone software as
soon as you can both Apple and Google
released security updates for the phones
all the times patching up
vulnerabilities so pushing off that
update just because it's inconvenient
only increases your risk just update
your phone and ideally get yourself a
phone from a manufacturer that promises
to support it with monthly security
patches and that's it those are the 10
steps you can take to help avoid getting
hacked again remember that this doesn't
make you 100% hack proof so you still
always got to be on the lookout for any
potential risks but for the most part
this will significantly reduce the odds
of you getting hacked anyways that is it
for me in this video I really hope you
guys found it helpful thank you guys for
watching and as always I'll see you in
