today we're doing a video on how to
flash or install a custom kernel on your
Android phone so this works basically
identically to the way it is to install
a custom ROM but I'll go ahead and show
you how to do it anyway you're going to
need to be rooted of course and you're
also going to need rom manager installed
on your phone so raw manager is
available for free on the android market
so download and install it flash the
clockworkmod recovery and then boot into
recovery so I'm go ahead and boot into
recovery and you have to allow for a
superuser just like you would for
anything else alright so the phone has
booted up into recovery mode and from
here I'm going to press volume up and
down to navigate up and down and hit
power to select whatever I'm highlighted
on so I'm going to go down to install
zip from sdcard because this is where
you're going to want to put your kernel
go to choose zip from sdcard and then
find your kernel 31 in Seoul this case I
have the overstock kernel I want to just
press on it the press power key scroll
down to yes hit the power key again to
select it and there you go it's
installing the custom kernel and now you
want to give it anywhere between five to
ten minutes to install not from here but
from after the restart so I'm going to
go back and hit reboot system now so
from here you're going to give it five
to ten minutes I'd say maybe even ten to
fifteen and I just let it sit even if
your phone looks like it's done loading
you want to just give it some time
because this actually does take quite
some time
so let it load it out and that way you
won't run into any you know for schools
issues which might happen if you rush
things alright that's it for me in this
video this is David from bumble calm
thank you for watching it and don't
forget to visit bumble comm for more
cellphone news reviews and how to's
