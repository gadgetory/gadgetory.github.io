and in this video I'm doing a video
sample from Google glass you can see
here I'm driving on this curvy windy
highway or Road and Sonia has an idea of
the video and sound quality and one
thing I do want to point out that I've
noticed since I've been using glass is
what you guys are seeing here isn't
exactly what I'm seeing you know it's
actually a little bit higher because the
camera is a little bit higher up
compared to my eye and it is a little
bit more - off to the right I believe so
just a little so sometimes if I have to
kind of adjust my head to make it look
dead-on but for the most part because it
is a wide-angle lens it does capture
most of what I'm looking at so pretty
cool obviously if I turn my eyes though
instead of just my head I'm not gonna be
able our glass isn't gonna capture what
I interact I'm looking at so I've kind
of made it I have these for when I'm
recording to turn my head Alex in a row
like this with a windy road to kind of
hats turn your head because you want to
counter the gravity but yeah so sit back
and enjoy
okay picture time
hey old it should do one without my god
that's not MC
see a low light capability low light
isn't that bad I mean can't really tell
if it a little glass window I'm looking
out with a viewfinder because it's not
really high res but it seems pretty good
inside the car yeah doesn't look like
it's working that good beautiful
California camera backpack there are
tourists are waving to us over there all
right
crane you okay yeah I go I go yeah
damn dude I never forget what's up here
oh yeah you don't know what's coming
next
it's crazy
alright guys that is pretty much it for
me in this video I hope you like this
little video sample that I put together
I know it's not much but should give you
an idea enough of how good the video
party is my windows are open right now
so lots of wind just want to give that
test too but anyways you liked the video
please give a thumbs up and subscribe to
the channel if you haven't already</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
