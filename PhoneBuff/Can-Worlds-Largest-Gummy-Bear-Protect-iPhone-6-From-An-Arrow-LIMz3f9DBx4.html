stunts deserved better this video may be
disturbing to some viewers what's up
guys david adjey here and welcome back
to the fifth episode of vs. the show
where we work with professionals to do
extreme durability tests today we have a
special one for you we have the world's
largest gummy bear in front of an iphone
we're gonna see if this thing can
actually protect the iPhone I don't know
what's gonna happen what do you think I
think a lots gonna happen this thing
smells great it tastes great but it will
it be strong enough to protect the
iPhone I don't think so
what do you think yeah I don't think so
I don't and he's kind of like melted
because he's been sending the Sun all
day you can see he's really sunburned so
like myself so well we'll see what
happens so this is actually David
alright let's get to the test
all right so here we are would bang
he's gonna be shooting the arrow in just
a second that gummiberry I started to
put back free because it looks like he's
trying to hug he's just like I just want
a hug has a smile on his face as its
melting yeah it's like nice and pudgy
now but sorry buddy we're gonna have to
shoot you take one for the team I don't
know we'll see
well he's never gonna take one for team
but he's gonna survive I doubt see my
phone on Oh team iPhone not prevent that
hate iPhone there we go
so good luck oh man
oh right in the jugular
he still wants to hug the world though
like he's so happy has a smile on his
face sacrificed his life for nothing so
at least you guys know gummy bears are
flavored hearted Wow so that was a good
shot too man
that was a great shot i d√©railleur I
really wanted you to see the slow-mo now
because of all the carnage here so let's
go ahead alright so here we are at the
high speed camera
gummy bear looks nice and friendly and
vulnerable and go ahead and play just
came out oh my god
that's messed up I feel bad I feel
guilty now for the phone for the damn
bear he looks so cuddly and cute and
smiley here you know I was curious see
if it was if it was cool down throughout
the day cuz right now it's all malleable
and likes yeah but either way it goes
that initial impact his whole the whole
back of his head just like caved out
we're gonna lean back straight through
the throat the jugular
that's a van that's better than that
shell he just he doesn't get it is a
professional no pro fashion now well
let's take it off of here oh my God look
the screen is sticking to the gummy oh
oh my god I'm coming apart okay honestly
Bennett maybe maybe I'll try to shimmy
it up get his uh let's get his earrings
off earrings yeah
the cool thing is the gummy bear caught
all the glass so this is probably our
cleanest oh you're like sticking some
using this hi so taking a look at the
phone you can flip them up lift them up
see what happens okay oh all right I saw
the phone this is all I opened up pretty
badly actually that's the worst I've
seen it three separate three separate
layers you got the front glass on here
this is like the actual display over
here you have a panel and on the back
straight through the battery why do you
guys always go for the battery I think
you're missing the most important point
though is all the guts all the glory oh
my God he's hugging my hand now he's he
sat on his
wash is all bad he has all these glass
shards sticking out oh you could lick
that if you want okay all right guys so
there you have it whether you have the
world's smallest or the world's largest
gummy bear it can't protect an iPhone
from an arrow let's take a look at this
thing it's not ripping which is pretty
impressive yeah it's really nice and
strong just not even a direct impact
from an arrow if you guys look at the
back here too you can see the exit wound
it's not pretty
that's where he gets all in slo-mo his
gut just came out all over and right the
battery what happened I was pretty
surprised I didn't go on fire I'm not
gonna would ya but we're running out
apart but that pretty much sums up for
this one
