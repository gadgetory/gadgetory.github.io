test you have all been asking for is
finally here between the HTC 10 and the
Samsung Galaxy s7 now both of these
phones are powered by these same
Snapdragon 820 processor along with 4
gigabytes ram so this we test like many
will come down to the software
optimization so with that said let's go
ahead and get right into it so you know
the drill we'll kick this thing off by
starting these stopwatches on each phone
and right off the bat the s7 takes the
lead over the HTC 10 with it quickly
snapping that selfie and moving on to
the gaming row where it begins working
on subway surf but with his quick
animations the HTC 10 hasn't fallen too
far behind with it also working on the
gaming row where it looks to make up for
lost ground as the s7 moves on to true
skate it looks like it has increases
lead over the HTC 10 with it now being a
full app ahead working on smash it so
the HTC 10 has its work cut out for it
but luckily it still has half of this
first lap to go along with all of these
second lap where if you've been keeping
up with our speed test you know that the
Snapdragon bearing of the s7 tends to
struggle as the HTC 10 began loading up
clash of clans the SN finishes up with
Photoshop mix and begins working on laps
it where both ones will have to put
their Snapdragon 820 s to the test
and create a time lapse from the same
exact video file which for this we test
is an awesome slow-mo clip of a money
toss so thumbs up for that anyways the
HTC 10 is now joining the s7 in this
processor intensive task and from the
looks of it is going at about the same
rate as the s7 which is kinda to be
expected as both phones have the same
processor which means that the HTC won't
be making up any ground here with the S
Evan maintaining its lead as it finishes
up laps it and moves on to Hulu so the
window of opportunity for the HTC 10 to
win the speed test keeps getting smaller
and smaller so at this point it's only
real shot at winning this thing is in
the second lap which speaking of the s7
is about to enter as it finishes the
last light of this first lap by loading
both the mobile and the desktop versions
of the Newegg website
and there you go the s7 finishes the
first lap with the time of 1 minute and
42 seconds with the HTC 10 trying its
best to catch up with it finishing the
first lap 10 seconds later with the time
of 1 minute and 52 seconds ok so this is
the moment all of you the HTC fans have
been waiting for the s7 had to reload
subway surfer so we'll see if the HTC
has to do the same and know it has the
app ready to go in the background as it
does true skate so the HTC 10 takes lead
just ripping through this second lap
with it seemingly having every app ready
to go in the background Photoshop mix
open laps it's open
Kulu open before I on my pants not open
anyways the Asian sea races to the
finish line with a total time of 2
minutes and 21 seconds with the second
lap only taking it 28 seconds to finish
so it's the same old story with the s7
with it not having all the apps ready to
go in the background despite having the
same amount of RAM with it finishing the
speed test with a total time of 2
minutes and 36 seconds making the winner
the HTC 10 that is it for me in this
video thank you guys for watching in as
always I'll see you in the very next
episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
