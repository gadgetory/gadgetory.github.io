and in this video I'm doing a list of
the top 10 gadgets are things that are
smartphones replace that maybe five ten
fifteen years ago we would have had to
carry around with us if you wanted to
have the same functionality so the first
thing that our smartphones replace is
our computers now I'll be real with you
obviously are smartphones don't replace
our computers completely but for most
people when they're at home at least not
necessarily at work the things they do
on their smart honor on their computer
like browsing the web watching videos on
YouTube facebooking each other and
things like that our email you could do
it right in your smartphone in fact I
know a lot of people who don't really
use your computers anymore because they
do most of their activity on their
smartphones so that's the first gadget
that our smart phones you know replace
our least reduce or you stood for the
next gadget is digital cameras I'm just
noticed a general trend of you know my
friends and family they've been using
the digital cameras less not something
before up maybe three years ago they
secure around the digital cameras
everywhere but now I just see them pop
out their iPhone or pop out there you
know latest android phone and take a
picture I mean why now with cameras you
know with megapixels of 52 up to 16
maybe even 40 on some phones out there
you really don't need to carry on a
digital camera obviously the digital
cameras will always offer better quality
but the smartphone's not only offer good
quality but they also offer the convince
being able to email pictures to each
other sharing it on Facebook because you
have the internet connected right there
so the next gadget that our smartphones
replace is our navigation systems or
tom-toms and garments I mean walk
through a parking lot you know nowadays
and you see less and less people you
know have those standalone units on the
dashboard because they really don't need
them i mean our phones come
pre-installed with google navigation if
you're on android comes with bing maps
if we're on windows phone in google maps
you're on iOS and each one of these
platforms get download you can download
an app from the market or market place
and get like the garment advert on some
app if you really wanted those the next
thing that our smartphones replace is
our psps or nintendo ds's basically our
portable gaming systems
with phones like the iPhone and high-end
Android phones of Windows phones with
Xbox Live getting you know these new
games like Angry Birds not only that but
actually more extensive games like max
payne GTA 3 and you know some of the
other titles like mad in the newest
version you really wonder if you should
get a portable game this is obviously
we're a hardcore gamer and you want to
be gaming on the go you'll get yourself
a portable gaming system but for most
people their smartphone will suffice you
know what the item for us with this GPU
with some of the quad cores on Android
like that Tiger 3 which is made by
Nvidia which makes graphic cards for
computers on the phone now you really
don't you know need to get something
different because your phone could
handle the graphing graphics are the
graphical processing required for the
games nowadays and not only that I mean
if you if you don't like the controls on
the phone stuff I mean having
multi-touch screen and using the solar
ometer for games isn't necessarily the
best thing but you can even get an apt
or at least on Android you give you an
adapter that connects your xbox 360
controller so that's definitely also I
mean I just feel like this thing's a
portable console for me now I just carry
this around so definitely cool
functionality there the next thing that
our smartphones replace is our
calculators I mean how many times how
many how did you really carry on the
calculator anymore obviously in school
they don't let you use your phones
because they don't want your cheat but
you know look at my calculator right
here you can see it looks just like the
calculator we all used in algebra when
we were younger we're still in school
you know it's it's really cool me you
have a scientific calculator and like I
said every smartphone has it you don't
really need to carry a scientific
calculator around with you anymore the
next thing that our smartphones replace
is our flashlights I mean what better
way to have a flashlight than to have it
on your phone you know if you're looking
for the keyhole when you're trying to
get into your house or car at night just
pop out your smartphone turn on the
flashlight app and boom you can see I
mean flashlights are really made for
what blackouts and times when you need
it and you're not going to be
conveniently carrying around a
flashlight unless you know in advance
that you're going into the dark area but
having on your smartphone is awesome the
next thing is our voice recorders you
know whenever I come up with a good idea
which is more often too
you guys are think but anyway I I'll
record it right on my phone and that way
I don't forget it um next thing that our
smartphones replaced which is the ninth
thing I have the number i'm sorry but
the ninth thing is are no PES i mean i
could just pull out my phone and write a
note and not only that i can actually do
by voice i can say you know memo to self
or you have series say remind me this or
make a note to myself that and actually
say the message and it'll write it out
for you on the memo pad sorry surprising
that a lot of people forget they have a
memo pad on their phone you know they'll
be on a phone call and go oh let me
write your number down hold on a second
let me write your address instead of
busting out the memo pad but anyway
that's another gap sure thing that our
smartphones replaced and the last thing
in probably one that we all use is this
guy real places are watched i mean how
many people wear watches nowadays i know
some people do and actually i've seen a
lot of people wear watches with the
wrong time and i asked him why why did
the wrong time said i don't wear my
watch for the time i wear for fashion
you know i use my phone for time not
only that we use our phones for alarm
clocks I mean I at least I do this guy
wakes me up every morning at eight
o'clock and you know I'm sure a lot of
guys could relate to that so anyway
that's the top 10 things that I feel
like our smartphones replace if you have
any idea as far as what gadgets that arm
opens replace leave in the comments if I
didn't go over them but that's pretty
much it for me in this video if you
