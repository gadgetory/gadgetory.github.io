fumble to start your free 7-day trial
today what's up guys david here from
fumble pen it's an exciting time of year
in the world of technology with Apple
announcing iOS 8 a few weeks back and
Google i/o just right around the corner
so I figured it was a good time to do a
Q&amp;amp;A and based off all the good questions
you guys would ask me on Twitter
Facebook and Google+ it looks like I was
right so let's go ahead and get to
answering some questions why do i phone
users hate Android I don't know but I
think you can ask the same question in
Reverse and why do Android users hate
the iPhone honestly when I see someone
being clearly biased against any OS I
usually chalk it up to two things one
either that person hasn't owned a device
running the OS that they're bashing and
we're just bashing it to sort of justify
their own purchasing decision or two
they're just really really passionate
about the OS they like and don't see why
others wouldn't feel the same way either
way I don't think it makes any sense to
be close-minded to any OS as every OS
and even every device for that matter
has its own set of unique advantages and
by closing yourself off to any of them
you may be missing an opportunity to at
least try something that you may end up
liking better what's your view on iOS
now being more open like Android with
third-party keyboards so as I was
watching the WWDC live stream a few
weeks ago I found myself getting more
and more excited with every new feature
Apple announced for iOS 8 now some of
these features did remind me an awful
lot of the features currently found on
Android but nonetheless there are
features that I think most of us have
been waiting for for a really long time
as far as Apple opening up iOS 8 I
couldn't be happier I mean it's still
not anywhere near the same level of
openness as you'd get on Android but
opening up iOS even just a little
ultimately puts more power into the
hands of developers which should not
only result in better apps but also a
better overall user experience
third-party keyboards like you mentioned
will definitely be a plus as you'll no
longer have to be stuck with just I o s
the stock keyboard but because I
personally already like iOS keyboard I'm
actually more excited about the new
sharing options the custom action
the widgets in the notification center
along with the ability for developers to
use touch ID in their apps instead of
requiring a lengthy password in a
nutshell I think with iOS 8 Apple is
starting to finally do what a lot of
Android users have been wanting Apple to
do since they left iOS for Android and
with the rumors of the bigger screen
iPhone just around the corner I think
the iPhone 6 combined with iOS 8 may
just sway some of those Android converts
right back to app or at the very least
make a lot of them reconsider it what do
you expect to see in the Samsung Galaxy
Note 4 and do you think it will compete
for the best smartphone in 2014
well while we still don't have any
official information on the Galaxy Note
4 based off the early rumors that we've
heard so far and the history of the
Galaxy Note line in general I'd expect
the note 4 to pack pretty much nothing
but the top the line specs when it gets
released I've been saying this since
back with the note 2 and I'll say here
again the Galaxy Note is Samsung's
high-end smartphone and what that means
it'll pack mostly high-end specs so I
expect things like a qHD display a
top-line processor like a Snapdragon 805
or one of Samsung's own octa-core chips
three or maybe even four gigabytes RAM
depending on how far Samsung wants to
push the spike sheet ip67 water and dust
resistance and a fingerprint scanner
like we saw in the galaxy s5 and of
course what makes the Galaxy Note the
Galaxy Note an improved version of the
s-pen so in other words yes I think the
note 4 will definitely compete as one of
the best smartphones in 2014 at least
when it comes to specs and if Samson
could put a more streamlined version of
TouchWiz on it and maybe even give it a
better build quality then it'll have a
real shot at being one of the best if
not the best smartphone in 2014
do you think all the new features with
iOS 8 especially hey Siri will affect
the current iPhones batteries
drastically the jury's still out on how
these features will affect battery life
with iOS 8 still being in beta but I
don't think Apple would sacrifice
battery life too much in order to bring
these features to existing iPhones in
fact that hey Siri feature you're
talking about is being limited to work
only when current iPhones are plugged
into a charger so that particular
feature won't affect battery life at all
but I imagine that one of the selling
points for the iPhone 6 will probably be
using hey Siri without it negatively
affecting battery life
Machoke you can use the okay Google now
feature on the Moto X what do you think
about the future of the Nexus line or
should I say Android silver are they
going in the right direction well first
off we don't know for sure if these
rumors are true until we get official
word from Google but for those of you
who haven't heard the rumors going
around right now or that Google plans on
killing off the next assign so there
will either be no Nexus 6 or the Nexus 6
will be the last Nexus and going forward
Google's going to replace the Nexus line
with what is currently being dubbed as
Android silver now when you first hear
that it sounds like a really bad thing
right I mean just like many of you I'm
going to love the next assign over the
years for both its stock Android
experience and amazing price points so
syncing it cancelled wouldn't really
make me all that happy but what does
give me a little bit of hope or what the
rumors are saying Android silver will be
basically Android silver will be a lot
like the Nexus program but it'll be
different in that it will feature
multiple devices from different
manufacturers and Google won't be
working directly with these
manufacturers to make the devices and
instead will give them a set of
guidelines that they need to follow in
order to have their devices sold and
marketed under the Android silver brand
name this way Google will still be able
to control the direction in which
Android heads much like they do with the
Nexus devices while also getting a wider
range of devices out there and actually
into the hands of consumers that should
not only result in more people getting a
better Android experience but also
Google taking back some of that control
over Android that they've lost to
companies like Samsung but enough about
the Android silver program itself what
about the actual Android silver devices
well they look like your typical Nexus
or will it more closely resemble the
Play editions honestly I think sort of
falls somewhere in between those two in
fact what I imagine in Android silver
phone to look like is a lot like the
Moto X I mean think about it for a
second the Moto X is running a near
stock version of Android and was built
with that version of Android in mind it
gets updated to the latest version of
Android a lot faster than most other non
Nexus devices it doesn't have a bunch of
manufacturer blower and maybe most
importantly it was made when Google
happened to own Motorola so maybe the
Moto X was a small preview of what's to
come with Android silver and if that's
the case and these rumors don't end up
being
and I definitely think that Google is
going in the right direction but what do
you guys think do you think Android
silver will help Android get to the next
level or do you think that ditching the
Nexus line is just a bad idea let me
know down below in the comments okay so
