growing up I still love watching the
James Bond movies not because of the
action not because of the girls
well not only because of the girls but
mainly it was the gadgets right get a
watch that would shoot out a laser
he had coolest cars and today we're
gonna be checking out something that
kind of reminds me of that it's a pen
but it's not just a pen it's a pen a
stylus and a little portable charger for
your iPhone I don't know how to
pronounce it lice lis ice so you can see
right here got your ballpoint pen touch
pad and then touch pen plus ballpoint
pen what you can get it for micro USB as
well as the Lightning port on your
iPhone go ahead and try it a while now
there's tape damnit knife meat box go
clean and precise oh it looks fancy this
actually looks a lot nicer than I
thought it was gonna be so you got the
pen right there and obviously you see
right here is the Lightning port where
you're gonna be able to plug it straight
into your phone
it has 800 milliamps I believe time to
give you a full charge but in case of an
emergency and you need that battery
light this will give you more than
enough to call an uber or call somebody
and then you have your two
pen tips so yeah it looks like a
mechanical pencil right okay there you
go all right that's how you do it so you
actually spin this guy like that so when
you spin it to the right it puts the
actual pin part back inside and we spin
it to the left pen comes out just like
that you can write smiley face yeah I
mean I haven't drawn since I was like
four years old this is the best thing I
could draw righty there's a last thing I
really learned how to draw as a kid oh
it's a ninja turtle Wow look at that
tell me that's not the best ninja to
love about Ninja Turtle you've ever seen
in your life
hey it works so this is actually pretty
cool now to test the stylus there you go
it's you know it's pretty comfortable to
hold
iOS 10 on this iPhone here works like a
charm
no the pen oh it might be there you go
if you got to make sure you twist this
thing all the way in you want to mark up
your freaking iPhone moment that you
have been waiting for it's a pen you
guys seen a pen work before you guys
have seen a stylus before probably want
to see if this thing works right so plug
it in here I'm gonna press this magic
button either it's gonna charge the
phone or it's gonna blow it up one of
the two works there you go so you can
see a little blue indicator light you
know what I'm gonna bring this closer to
camera so you guys can see
no there's no indicator at all for you
to be able to tell how much batteries
actually left in this thing but some
blonde was not plugged in does nothing
plug this guy in blue light good
question Jay how do you charge the
actual charger I don't know but I'm
assuming it's gonna be on this side yeah
all right you pop this off oh that
that's frickin pretty nice man so you
don't the TARDIS I please plug it into
your computer plug into your wall brick
whatever you're gonna have a working
charging phone battery or battery pack
for your phone and there you go this is
pretty dope how much I get this for 22
bucks on Amazon I'll be putting a link
for you guys down below in the
description if you are interested all
right guys I mean that right there is
you're one step closer to being James
Bond
you got a SmartWatch got the smartphone
now you got your smartpen I mean I don't
know if you call it a smart pen but it
powers your other smart devices so damn
it it's close enough that is it for me
in this video you guys enjoyed it give
it a big thumbs up to show you lavinda
as always I'll see you in the very next
episode
you had a watch that blew out a laser
get friggin a suit that blew them up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
