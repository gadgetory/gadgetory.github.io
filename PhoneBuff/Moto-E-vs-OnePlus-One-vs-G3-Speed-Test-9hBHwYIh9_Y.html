today i've got an interesting speed test
for you guys between the near stock
android 120 dollar moto e these specs
out $300 oneplus one and the high-end
$600 g3 which together will give us a
much better idea as to how much
performance every dollar we spend is
actually buying us but before we get
into the action i want to tell you guys
about the sony action cam so like its
name implies the action cam is made for
very action ii situations from these
slopes and the rapids to racetracks and
bike trails with features like advanced
built-in image stabilization the live
view remote and gps the action camera
gives you crisp and clear Full HD
footage making it one heck of an extreme
camera if you want to see more action
cam footage click over here or on the
first link down below in the description
head over to Sony's action cam Channel
and while you're there give them a
subscribe and let them know I sent you
alright let's get right into it alright
so as always all phones are coming off a
fresh reboot and are connected to the
same Wi-Fi network well begin by
starting these stopwatches and all three
phones and then head into the camera app
where both the 1+1 and the g3 seem to be
already pulling away from the less
respect Moto e heading in to Temple Run
2 so it's at this stage in a speed test
where we've often seen devices that get
off to a slow start make a comeback but
in the case of the Moto e that doesn't
look like it's going to happen as the
oneplus one ntg-3 are both now a full
app ahead of it
finishing up loading Photoshop Touch and
moving on to score mobile as far as
separation goes between the oneplus one
and the g3 there really isn't all that
much with the oneplus one hanging on to
a split second lead heading into the
final obstacle in the browser test as
they load up the mobile version
the Moto e seems to be falling even
further behind with its weaker hardware
struggling on score mobile now the final
stretch of the speed test the oneplus
one and the g3 are both neck-and-neck
it really is anybody's game at this
point and it
looks like the 1+1 is actually gonna be
the winner here finishing with the time
of 1 minute flat with the g3 finishing
just 2 seconds later so looking over at
the Moto where you can see that it's
just barely getting into the full
Versailles which does take a while so
I'll go ahead and fast-forward this part
and you can see it finishes with a time
of 1 minute and 35 seconds ok so what do
we learn here number one the one plus
one is just a ridiculous deal at $300
outperforming upon the cost twice as
much
number two the Moto e isn't as fast as
some of the speed tests on the web seem
to suggest but at just $120 you had to
give it as props because it does hold
its own and finally number three speed
isn't everything there's a lot more to
consider in a phone and it's priced in
just raw performance but if you have a
need for speed and you happen to be on a
budget the oneplus one is easily the
fastest phone for the money right now of
course there's that matter of getting
oneplus to actually take your money but
anyways that is it for me in this video
if you liked it please give it a thumbs
up and show your love and I'll catch you
guys in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
