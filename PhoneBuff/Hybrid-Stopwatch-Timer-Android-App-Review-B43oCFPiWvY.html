and in this video I'll be doing a review
on the hybrid stopwatch and timer app
available from the Google Play Store so
having the Galaxy Nexus
there was no pre-loaded timer and
stopwatch on my phone so I actually went
to the market downloaded a bunch of them
and I decided which one I like best
obviously since I'm doing this review
this is the one that I like best so with
that said I'll go ahead and get right
into it so the first thing that I really
love about this stopwatch is the fact
that it combines functionality with
great looks I found a lot of apps out
there that had good functionality but
this looked horrible and I found an app
so I looked pretty good but didn't have
the functionality I needed this one
combines both of those things and I'll
show you just how so for example right
now I'm on a timer our timer mode and I
set to one minute now I hit start and
you can see this little animation of the
second hand going counterclockwise just
like you would with that you know
handheld stopwatch on an old-school one
now I could stop it of course and start
it again by hitting this middle button
of course you have the digital readout
right at the top and you can't really
tell right here cuz it's only at one
minute but there's also a minute hand so
I'll go ahead and set it to like 6
minutes and you can see a little minute
hand right here moved along so as you're
winding down in time this will move as
well now I'll go ahead and show you what
happens when the time runs out so I'll
set the timer for about 5 seconds hit
start go to my home screen you can see
it shows up in the notification bar so
you know what timer is active and we'll
just wait to complete and you can see
that little pop-up notification so
that's a really cool feature you know
you'll never really lose track of
retirement now let's look at the
stopwatch really quick so a stopwatch
works in the same way of course the
second hand goes clockwise instead of
counterclockwise and of course you could
stop it and start it again if you wanted
to do a lap you can press lap right here
and what's cool when you press lap is
the last lap that you pressed shows up
on the analog display as well and of
course we go to lap lists you have your
record a lap so if I do a whole bunch of
laps right here they'll show up right
here in this list and if I want to reset
it and clear out the lap list just hit
reset and everything's gone
so it says lap list is empty what I
really like what the timer is the
ability to use the volume up and down
button so we really feels like a normal
timer to control it so I'll press volume
up it starts the timer and I could press
volume up again to pause it press it
again
to start it and then actually presents
volume down to reset it so if I press
down I'm sorry volume down records a lap
while you're so while you're while the
timer's going or press william down it
records a lap right there and then if I
press one ago it pauses it for bridge
bowing down again if we start it resets
like it did right there so pretty cool
functionality with the volume controls
of course if you don't want to use it
you don't have to I'll go ahead and go
into the settings real quick to show you
what it looks like of course when you
press the menu button
you have your lap list yours you can
send the laps and you go to the timer
mode of course you also have the ability
to go to preferences so let's show you
what kind of options you have a little
quick you could keep the screen on if
you want keep the sound on so it plays a
sound loop on the time we're finished so
if you don't want that annoying sound
you can just turn it off of course you
could choose what ringtone you want to
use for that and you could also select
how long you want the alarm to go on so
I have it for five seconds which is
something I don't actually want some
timers out there will literally keep
beeping until you hit this dismiss so I
really like this feature because it's
not too annoying and of course you could
also decide whether or not you want
vibrate feedback use volume up and down
and if you even change the color so I'll
go to green and hit back and you can see
the whole theme of the app change so
definitely a really good app if you're
looking for a good stopwatch and timer I
recommend this one I the free version is
supported by advertisements I actually
bought it to buy you just hit remove ads
tasted a little payment gateway I think
it cost a dollar or two and you buy and
you have ad free
version alright that's it from me in
