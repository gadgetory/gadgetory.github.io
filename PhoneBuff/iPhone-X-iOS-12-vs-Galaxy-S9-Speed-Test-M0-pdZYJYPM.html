unveiled iOS 12 an update where they
said they're doubling down on
performance and an update that can
supposedly make an older phone like the
iPhone 6 plus load apps up to 40 percent
faster under normal conditions and up to
two times faster while under load and
what Apple isn't necessarily promising
these same type of numbers when it comes
to their newer phones they did say that
iOS 12 will bring performance
improvements across their entire lineup
so today will be pretty interesting
speed test we have iOS 12 beta 2
installed on the iPhone 10 where it'll
go up against its biggest competitor in
the galaxy s 9 plus to see if he can
redeem itself after losing to a in a
speed test earlier this year now of
course this is beta software on the
iPhone okay so like things can easily
change by the time Apple officially
rolls out iOS 12 but at the very least
this test may just give us an idea as to
what we can expect so skit right into it
all right we'll kick things off by
starting the stopwatch is on each phone
and then immediately jumping into
facebook where the Galaxy S nine plus is
able to get the step over the iPhone 10
and maintain its lead going through
Starbucks moving on to Microsoft Word
we're loading the same massive 500 page
documents on each phone where the iPhone
10 is able to finish loading it at a
faster rates wiping out the galaxy s
nines early lead as both phones finish
up with Excel and move on to the second
row where neither phone is able to get
any kind of separation through the
camera app let's see if there's a
difference here in Snapseed with both
phones editing the selfie that they just
took by adding the same exact filter and
looks like the iPhone 10 was actually
able to export that photo at a faster
rate let's see if we can do the same
while editing this short video clip here
in lab sits and no it seems like the
Snapdragon 845 in the s9 plus is going
toe-to-toe with the a11 Bionic chip in
the iPhone with both phones rendering
that time-lapse in roughly the same
amount of time moving on to the browser
test we're performing the same Google
trend search on each phone where the
iPhone 10 just blazes through it while
the sm+
stutters a bit with loading the chart
along the iPhone tend to gain the
biggest lead we've seen so far here in
this speed test what they're pulling
almost a full lap ahead of the s9 but of
course the s9 plus still has plenty of
time to make a comeback with not only a
handful of apps remaining here in the
first lap but the entire second lap left
to go where I'm curious to see whether
or not iOS 12 beta makes a difference
when it comes to RAM management because
as any of you who've been following our
sweets has snow the iPhone has typically
done really well here in the first lap
but has struggled in this second lap
ever since iOS 11 seems to have messed
things up so it'll be interesting to see
what happens but it is worth noting that
since we are using much more intensive
apps this time around the second lap is
going to be more challenging than ever
so there's no guarantee that the s9 plus
will be able to keep all the apps open
either nonetheless the iPhone Town has
officially pulled a full app ahead as it
finishes up with targets and clocks in a
time of 2 minutes and 15 seconds with
the s 9 Plus making up some ground
coming in just three seconds later and
now the moment we have all been waiting
for has I Oh s 12 finally fixed Ram
and so far so good the iPhone is even
able to keep flip diving open but it
fails to keep subway surfers open but
thinks that elidio is able to build up
in the first stop the iPhone 10 is still
technically in this thing with it being
just a split second behind the s9 plus
but heartbreaker it fails to keep
Snapseed fully ready to go along the ice
9 plus to pull ahead late here in the
second lap with the iPhones failure to
keep Excel open pretty much being the
dagger letting the Galaxy S 9 cruise to
the finish line with a time of 3 minutes
and 1 seconds with us fast 4 in the
iPhone 10 where it completed the test
with the time of 3 minutes and 28
seconds making the winner the galaxy s 9
plus now we ran this test over and over
and over again and the results here were
consistent however we did get a
different result when we ran this same
test on iOS 12 beta 1 you can check out
that video on our Twitter profile link
for you down below in the description
but outside of that that is it for me in
this video thank you guys for watching
and as always I'll see you in the very
next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
