you by lynda.com click on the first link
in the description below to start your
free 7-day trial today what's up guys
david here from film buff and it's been
a couple of weeks since google i/o and
the announcement of android l I've had
the Developer Preview of LM installed on
my Nexus 5 since then and I've gotta
tell you guys
Android L is a really big deal it's
easily one of the biggest updates to
Android since Android so in this video I
want to go over what I think are the top
10 new features in Elm starting off with
number one which is probably what you've
heard about the most in the last couple
of weeks in the all new material design
so the main takeaway here is that
material design is the biggest UI
overhaul since all the way back in 2011
with Ice Cream Sandwich the overall look
and feel of material design is a bit
more colorful than the holo theme we've
seen over the years with a lot more
attention to the detail you know the
little things from the way the screen
responds when you touch it to these
small animations the toggles have in the
settings but material design isn't meant
to just give Android a facelift but it's
also meant to bring a universal design
across all of your devices so that way
regardless of whether you're using
Android wear a Chromebook a web app or
even Android TV the experience you get
will be a more familiar one and
therefore easier to use to notifications
the notifications in Android have always
been great but with L Google has taken
them to a whole new level so the first
thing you'll notice that's different
with notifications are that they now
show up right on your lock screen
without the need for you to swipe the
notification shade down speaking of the
notification shade and L they're
technically isn't one instead when you
swipe the notification bar down you get
a list of your notifications without
these shade itself taken off the rest of
the screen so if you have no
notifications most of your screen still
remains visible and it seems like
getting notifications out of the way was
a goal Google had without as they also
added heads of notifications which pop
up on the top third of the screen for
important notifications like when you're
getting a call allowing you to either
answer or ignore them quickly without
the notification itself being too
obtrusive three quick settings while
I'll show you the notification shade
just a second ago you may have noticed
that the button for quick settings at
the top right is no longer there but
don't worry quick settings still
now they're actually a lot easier to get
to and L all you have to do is swipe the
notification bar down twice to get to
quick settings which to me beats having
to press the button all the way in the
corner on the lock screen it's even
easier as you only have to swipe down
one since you're already getting your
notifications on the lock screen itself
as far as toggles go you have all the
same ones that you had in KitKat
but in L you can now adjust the
brightness right in quick settings you
also have a toggle for chromecast and
maybe more importantly Google finally
decided to add a toggle for auto rotate
I have no idea why it took them so long
to do this but I guess it's better late
than never for Android runtime okay so I
already did a video covering what art is
and why it's so important but in case
you missed it I'll link it for you down
below in the description but for now I
need to know that is with art your phone
will be able to run apps faster and more
efficiently are also being support for
things like 64-bit CPU so don't be
surprised if we start seeing 64-bit
Android phones by the end of this year
five project Volta
with L also comes project Volta aka
Google's attempt at finally making
battery life better on Android project
Volta is comprised of things like the
new job scheduler API which helps apps
do more of their unimportant tasks while
your phone is charging instead of all
running on battery the new and improved
battery historian gives you greater
insight into how your battery is being
used up and it even tells you how much
time you have left until your phone dies
and also how long it'll take to get it
back to full while you're charging
finally Google is officially including a
power saver mode into stock Android
which combined with all the other
improvements in project Volta has given
a phone like the Nexus 5 30 to 40
percent more battery life which is just
absolutely huge 6 do not disturb no it's
not that big of a feature and we've
already seen it in iOS and other
manufacturers skins but having
do-not-disturb built right into stock
Android is definitely welcome especially
since Google implemented it better than
anyone else
letting you access it quickly and easily
when you hit one of the volume buttons
you can turn Do Not Disturb on right
from the pop-up and what I love about it
is you can also set a temporary do not
disturb so that way when you go to a
movie you can set do not disturb on for
two hours go through the movie without
your phone bothering you
and when you get out you don't have to
worry about forgetting to turn your
ringer back on as it'll do it
automatically seven personal unlocking
if you wash my attend features every
smartphone should have video you know
that I love the fingerprint scanner on
my iPhone 5s because it lets me secure
my phone without that extra layer of
security slowing me down well personal
unlocking an Android L is similar in the
sense and that lets you secure your
phone with a pin or a password but the
phone will only prompt you for it when
it can't detect a trusted Bluetooth
device or a trusted location so when
you're at home your phone will bypass
the lock screen but if you go out to eat
at a restaurant and you forget your
phone there you don't have to worry
about strangers getting into it as the
password will be automatically enabled
now I'm not saying this is as good as a
solution as a fingerprint scanner but it
is a convenient way for people like me
who don't like the extra step of a
password to be able to secure their
phone without it driving them absolutely
crazy eight hardware-assisted hot word
over the past few weeks Google has been
rolling out an update to the Google
Search app on the Nexus 5 that lets you
use the ok Google command not only from
your phone's homescreen but also on any
other screen so if you're in the counter
out for example you can just say ok
Google and Google now will pop right up
but what about when this screen is off
that's what the hardware-assisted hot
word feature is all about
let's specific Hardware assist in the
dissection of a specific hot word in
this case ok Google now if that's not
familiar to you it's because it is the
Moto X has wrote like this since the day
it came out but with the Android L it
looks like we'll start to see more more
devices bring this feature to the table
9 reasons and now not only do the
virtual touch buttons look different but
the recent window have gotten a material
makeover as well gone are the little
thumbnails of apps that we've seen since
ICS and in order these larger and
Rolodex style tabs that look a lot like
the tabs in chrome speaking of which the
new recess menu has what Google is
calling document-centric multitasking
allowing apps like chrome to have
separate windows and reasons for
individual tasks for example in chrome
if you're working with two or three tabs
in your calculator app you want to
switch from the calculator to Chrome
then to the tab that you want and
instead you'll be able to go straight
from the calculator to the individual
tab that you need
ten Android L wait what a top-ten
feature on Android L is Android L well
no actually it's just the name or rather
lack thereof think about it every major
version of Android has been accompanied
by a dessert in alphabetical order we
had cupcake donut Eclair Froyo
gingerbread honeycomb Ice Cream Sandwich
then jelly bean and then Kit Kats and
now we just get out doesn't make any
sense does it well actually it kind of
does seem L is the first time Google
came out and releasing a new version of
Android before was finished in a
developer preview so what's the big deal
well by releasing a developer preview
before they're really ready for L to go
primetime Google is giving developers
and manufacturers a chance to get a feel
for what Android L is all about so that
way by the time Android L is ready for
primetime everybody else will be ready
for it this may just lead to faster
updates for both apps and devices and
potentially increase the adoption rate
of L compared to previous version of
Android which historically have been
pretty bad okay so that about does it
for my top 10 features on Android L but
