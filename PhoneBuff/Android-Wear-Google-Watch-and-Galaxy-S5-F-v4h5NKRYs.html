and i'm excited to finally be doing one
of these Q&amp;amp;A videos again it's been a
while maybe a little bit too long since
I've done one and there have been a lot
of good questions that have been getting
lately but before we get to answering
any of them I want to give a big shout
out to the sponsor for today's episode
and boost mobile so right now boost
mobile has some seriously good deals
going on where if you switch to boost by
the end of the month you get fifty
dollars off of a new smartphone and on
top of that you get the option for
unlimited talk text and data all without
having to sign a contract so definitely
check out that first link down in the
description check out the deals that
boost mobile has to offer and help
support the channel in the process all
right let's get to answering some
questions do you think that in the next
five years there will be another OS that
can compete with Android and iOS with
the same level of success so back when
Windows Phone was first announced in
2010 I thought that maybe what the
company as big as Microsoft back in it
that Windows Phone would have a good
chance of becoming that a West that
competes closely with Android and iOS
but obviously four years later windows
phone is still growing and still
improving it's not growing at a fast
enough rate to catch up to Android and
iOS so to answer your question no I
don't think it'll be another OS that
will come close to competing with your
big too and this when it comes to market
share if a company as big as Microsoft
with its huge presence and probably even
bigger marketing budget can't do it then
it's a tough sell for small companies
like blackberry to be able to do so so
as of right now the battle for any of
the newer os's is for third place behind
Android and iOS but still hit far ways
away from the number two spot how old
are you at the time of recording this
video I am 24 years old but I'll be
turning 25 at the end of April which is
it as exciting as turning 18 or 21 but I
do have to say that I'm looking forward
to seeing my car insurance rates go down
what are your thoughts on wearable
technology like smartwatches or Google+
you know when I got this question a few
days back
entirely different answer in mind but
today google just announced that android
will be officially extending into
wearables and what they're calling
android wear which from the looks of it
is going to be an optimized version of
google now right on your watch now in my
video on the Galaxy gear a few months
back I said that if a SmartWatch company
could get a voice assistant like Siri or
Google now onto a SmartWatch then the
value proposition of the SmartWatch in
general would be much much greater than
it is today and with the announcement of
Android wear Google may be the first
company to bring this value to market
now I've had the opportunity to use
google glass and a variety of
smartwatches like galaxy gear and while
have preferred the functionality of
google glass with basically google now
pat on your face I've always felt more
comfortable and less awkward with a
SmartWatch since it's something that I'm
already used to wearing and watch is
also something that everybody else is
already used to seeing I think by
bringing Android and Google now to the
SmartWatch and working with
manufacturers chip makers and fashion
companies to actually make these
smartwatches look like normal watches
Android wear will be seriously
successful and it might just be the
thing that starts the wearable
revolution but of course it is a little
bit too early to saying it will be a few
months before Android wear it comes to
market but from what google is showing
off and what the manufacturers Google is
working with is showing off it looks
really really promising and I have to
say that this is the most excited I've
been about where we'll text since well
basically ever what is your take on the
galaxy s5 so on the day that the galaxy
s5 was personal I went to Twitter and
said that I thought it was an
evolutionary update over the galaxy s4
and I still feel the same way today I
don't see anything that is particularly
revolutionary about the galaxy s5 and
honestly I think that might be a good
thing because instead of trying to make
the phone seem revolutionary like
Samsung did with all those gimmicky Arab
gestures on the s4 samsung instead
focused mostly on the things that
actually matter the new 16 megapixel
camera looks like it'll be a solid
improvement over the camera on the
galaxy s4 which was already good to
begin with
the fingerprint reader should make the
process of unlocking and securing your
phone much more convenient the ip67
water and dust resistance will probably
end up saving thousands upon thousands
of galaxy phones out there and the new
ultra power saving mode should help
significantly improve battery life so
while is an evolutionary update it looks
to be an overall solid update and
honestly at this stage in the smartphone
game that's all you could really ask for
since there are only so many things you
can change to make the phone bill
revolutionary before some of those
changes end up taking away from the
experience instead of adding to it so I
think Samsung get a overall pretty good
job if you had to choose one phone to
use for the rest of your life which
phone would it be okay so that that's an
interesting question by to choose just
one phone to use for the rest of my life
I probably ought to go with the Galaxy
Note 3 I mean it's the phone that I use
right now is my daily driver and I'm
actually pretty happy with it but more
importantly it's also probably the most
future-proof phone out there with 4k
video recording USB 3.0 a boatload of
RAM and expandable storage in addition
to all the other high-end specs that
you'd expect from a smartphone in 2014
alright if you guys have any questions
for me that you like to see answered in
a future episode ask them down in the
comments below or hit me up on Facebook
Twitter or Google+ and who knows they
may just get featured in the next Q&amp;amp;A
but otherwise that's it for me in this
video if you liked it hit that thumbs up
button to show you love and if you
haven't already I'd hit that subscribe
button because there are some awesome
tech videos coming up soon that you do
not want to miss thank you for watching
and I'll catch you guys in the very next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
