and look what I got in the middle today
it's the nexus 4 wireless charger I've
been waiting to get my hands on one of
these guys since all the way back in
November when I first got the nexus 4
and it's been unavailable until just
recently when Google started reselling
it on google play for about sixty
dollars if you guys follow us on twitter
or bombo com you probably already knew
that but anyways I'm really excited to
do this unboxing so let's go ahead and
get right into it we'll start off this
unboxing by taking a look at the box
itself as you can see the box looks very
similar to the one that came with the
nexus 4 on the front of the box it
reminds you that this is indeed a
wireless charger with some pictures of
the orb some Nexus branding on the top
left and an LG sticker at the top right
letting you know that it's an original
accessory on the back you get a google
logo and a model number which is wcp
dash four hundred and you get some
directions in a couple of different
languages which simply tells you to
place your Nexus 4 on the wireless
charger to begin charging should it be
too hard to figure out so going further
down the box you get a barcode and your
typical logos for things like FCC and
recycling on the left side of the box
there's some nexus for branding it tells
you again that it's a wireless charger
right below it and at the bottom there
you get the LG logo and on the right
side you pretty much get the same exact
thing top and bottom are completely
blank so we'll go ahead and open this
guy up alright so to open up the box we
first have to flip it over get our
trusty razor and cut through the clear
plastic sticker on the top of the box
alright so we'll go ahead and pop off
the top part of the box and reveal
what's on the inside go ahead and slide
it out and there you go you have your
nexus 4 wireless charger of course you
have your Quick Start Guide which you
know if the directions on the back of
the box weren't enough for you you have
a detailed guide explaining how to use
it which is pretty much plug it in and
stick upon it but anyway you have a USB
cable over here in the car in which is
kind of hard to get out but your typical
USB cable looks a little bit different
on the tip which you know might be
optimized to fit into the or but seems
like a normal one would work too you
have a USB wall adapter which is a
little bit longer than your typical but
nothing really special there and last
but not least you have the orb or the
wireless charger itself
we'll go ahead and take off this plastic
part my favorite part of unboxings
usually with phones is taking off the
screen protector guess this will
actually have to do but there you go you
have the orb which has a little bit of a
grippy feel to it which you know makes
you feel pretty secure as far as your
phone you know sticking on it and not
falling off on the back you have your
USB charging port the bottom you just
have your FCC logos and whatnot but that
is pretty much it for what's inside of
the box we'll go ahead and demo how the
nexus 4 works when you actually doc it
onto the orb and let you listen to the
sound it makes with Android 4.2 point2
as you can see it works pretty well even
when I kind of threw the Nexus 4 on
there it was still able to stick onto
the orb so we don't worry too much about
the phone slipping off alright guys
that's pretty much it for me in this
unboxing if you found this video helpful
