reached out wanting to team up and
sponsor a job says one of the things
they're really proud of themselves on
was the flex rock material found inside
of their evo tactical extreme case
according to tech 21 this unique
material both absorbs and dissipates the
impact force when you drop your phone
giving you the same high level
protection at some of the bulkier cases
on the market while still maintaining a
relatively thin profile now this all
sounds great in theory right I mean who
doesn't want a case that's thinner and
that doesn't compromise on protection
but without a side-by-side comparison
there's really no way to know if the
flat rock material lives up to the hype
so today we're going to be putting the
evo tactical extreme edition to the test
comparing it side-by-side to one of the
most rugged cases out there and the
otterbox defender series which is 40%
heavier 52% thicker on the sides and 89%
thicker on the back so clearly the
otterbox defender has the size advantage
it's definitely the bulkier case you can
feel it when it's in your hand and
definitely when it's in your pockets so
the question is can the Evo tactically
stream Edition go toe-to-toe with the
OtterBox Defender Series despite being
so much thinner and lighter well only
one way to find out round number one 60
drops from pockets chest and head height
all right so 60 drops n let's see how
they did so here's the tech21 case here
is the OtterBox case I'm sore from doing
all these squats and both bones are
working fine I think the better test is
seeing of 3d touch works if they do all
right take a look at the phones or the
cases themselves same story I mean just
a few more additional scuffs but overall
not bad I'm pretty to have impressed by
both these cases right now round number
two five consecutive drops from eleven
feet well go ahead and drop them from
the side first so three two one and
three two one
one that was a damn good job and three
two one one I don't know I don't know
about this one like five five drops all
right signs of life
it looks like the screen protector on
the tech21 absorb some impact there we
got slight cracking but that's only the
screen protector OtterBox still looks
fine yep
they look good looks like we're going to
go to the next level round number three
five drops from 22 feet three two one
two one one one and three two one
the tactile extreme case so on its face
I can see the otterbox defender is still
up and running now this one got unlucky
it fell on its face but it's still going
alright guys that is very very
impressive cases themselves again
scuffed up to the brand but what else do
you expect final round as many drops as
it takes from 33 feet this is really
high out
so both songs still work in three two
one oh wow let's see if it did what no
other case has done before and survived
and all right looks like the tech21 case
gave out but the OtterBox case actually
so it the screen is on but it's not
responsive and this one looks like it
cracked all right so we're back in this
video to take a closer look at each foam
where after watching the slow-mo replay
from that 33 foot drop it turns out that
the text one in one case fell on its
face once again causing its internal LCD
to crack the auto box on the other hand
has a good luck of falling on its back
but even then the sheer force from that
33 foot drop was just too much for it to
handle with its screen being completely
unresponsive to the touch and almost
completely dimmed out so obviously
neither of these phones is usable at
this point both need to have their
screens replaced in order to be able to
regain any kind of functionality
essentially making this drop test a tie
now I have to say that both of these
cases are going to give you some of the
best protection you can get for your
iPhone but if you're looking for the
same high level of protection you can
get with some of the bulkier cases
without the bulk and extra weight the
tech21 case is obviously going to be the
better option pound for pound I mean
that flexwrap material is for sure the
real deal as again look at the size
difference guys they went toe-to-toe
that's insane anyways that is it for me
in this video thank you guys for
watching and as always I'll see you in
the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
