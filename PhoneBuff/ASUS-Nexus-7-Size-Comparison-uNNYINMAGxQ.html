will be doing a size comparison with the
Nexus 7 tablet from Asus by Google I
just want to show you guys how it you
know compares with some of the other
devices on the market but first i want
to show you how it fits in the hand so
as you guys can see i am able to kind of
grip my hand around it you know i can
shake it all around and I'm not going to
drop it so definitely fits in one hand
as far as one handed operation obviously
the screen this big it's not going to
happen I mean I could reach like the
bottom right side of the tablet but you
know nothing on the top left top writer
very bottom left so anyway it is gonna
require two hands but that's expect
within a tablet what that says go ahead
and compared to some devices here is the
galaxy note which is five point three
inches so this is 7 inch screen again
Galaxy Nexus so the other Nexus device
at four point six five inches is the
screen and then the iphone 4s right over
here which is 3.5 inches so you guys can
see um obviously it's a big jump from
each device ah but these are all phones
so let's go ahead and compare it to a
tablet and we'll do the most popular
tablet which is obviously the ipad so
let me find that guy there it is so
here's ipad and you know when you put
the ipad next to the next 7 it makes it
look you know super small I mean the
ipad is definitely a big big tablet
obviously you know the screen is 10
inches but the borders are really big as
well you know the borders on the next 7
are definitely thinner so keep that in
mind you know it's only a three inch
difference but it looks like it's a lot
more because the thicker up bezels with
the ipad so putting it on top of the
ipad it looks like that you know takes
up about maybe seventy five percent of
it so anyway that's the size comparison
let's go ahead and do a side of you guys
can see you know how get an idea as far
as how thick the Nexus 7 is so it looks
about the same as the ipad but the ipad
has a more of a curve design on the back
i mean to both do but this one's more of
a more curvy so it looks thinner it
probably is thinner i mean i don't know
the exact specifications but i'll look
it up we'll do a quick side comparison
or side comparison with the other
devices ad so galaxy note Galaxy Nexus
and
phone so pretty close obviously these
that are phone so they're gonna be a
little bit thinner but anyway that's it
for me and this video just wanted to
give you guys the quick size comparison
hopefully this gives you a better idea
as far as you know how big and how thick
the Nexus 7 is because you know going
off especially alone is enough sometimes
you need to see it as far as the weight
it feels really light I mean I'm able to
hold one hand and like I said you know
just I don't know it feels really light
really good this leather backing really
makes it easy to grip I mean I feel like
I'm not gonna drop even I hold it like
this like see I can hug it shake it and
I don't have a grip on it is because the
leather backing really is creepy so
anyway that's it for me in this video
