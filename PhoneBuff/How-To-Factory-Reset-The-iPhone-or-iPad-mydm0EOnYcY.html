in this video i'm gonna show you how to
do a factory reset a hard reset master
reset whatever you want to call it on
your ipad or iphone so it works the same
obviously for both devices because of
both running the same operating system
so what you're gonna do is go over to
your settings icon our app and from here
you're gonna go to the general tab so
tap on general and then scroll down to
the very bottom where it says reset tap
on reset and you see you have a few
options here now if you want to reset
all your settings you can do that but
it's gonna completely factory reset it
and I'll basically make it as it was a
brand new iPad or iPhone the way you do
it is hit erase all content and settings
so what this does is basically is going
to erase everything great for when
you're trying to sell the phone or give
it away or if you just want to start
from scratch so anyway doing this will
delete all media all data and all
settings as it warns right here as soon
as you're ready to do it just hit the
erase button and then again it's gonna
ask you again if you want to do it
because it's that series because it does
wipe out absolutely everything so hit
erase and as you can see it is just
doing a quick restart and you're just
gonna let this thing go through it's
gonna take a couple minutes depending on
which generation you have obviously the
faster processors go illiterate faster
this the first gen iPad that I'm doing
it on so it is going a little bit slower
but anyway just let it do its thing and
within a couple of minutes it should be
done and that is pretty much it thank
you for watching the video
Steve boom boom calm and don't forget to
visit bump up calm or cell phone use
reviews and how to's thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
