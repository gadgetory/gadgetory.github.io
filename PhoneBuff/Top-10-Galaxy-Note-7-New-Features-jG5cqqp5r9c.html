just announced the galaxy note 7 which
technically should have been called the
note 6 since 6 comes after 5 but either
way the note 7 is official and it comes
with a bunch of new features so today
we're looking at 10 of the best new
features the note 7 has to offer let's
get right into it
top new feature number 1 curvy design
the note 7 now has a dual curved edge
where both the edges of the screen
curved over towards the side of the
phone which combined with the curved
back should translate into a more
comfortable fit in the hand the phone
will also be available in four different
color options in the traditional black
onyx silver titanium gold platinum along
with a new blue coral option to Gorilla
Glass 5 the glass on both the front and
the back of the note is Gorilla Glass 5
which corning claims can survive drops
from up to 1.6 meters now I don't know
if I believe that and you can pet will
be doing a bum bow style drop test on it
soon but for now the note 7 should in
theory be at least more durable than the
note 5 3 camera the note 7 inherits the
same two cameras we saw in the galaxy s7
which is not a bad thing at all the 5
megapixel front-facing camera has an F
1.7 aperture which will let you take
glorious selfies even when in low-light
conditions and the F 1.7 12 megapixel
camera on the back has dual pixel
technology which gives you crazy fast
autofocus so you'll always get the shot
that you want for ip68 water and dust
resistance like the galaxy s7 the note 7
is ip68 water and dust resistant but
what's interesting here is that the
s-pen is also water resistant meaning
you can actually take notes on the phone
when you're in the shower which is smart
since that's where all the good ideas
happen anyways number 5 more memory the
base model of the note 7 comes with 64
gigabytes of storage doubling the 32
gigabytes that came with the note 5 and
if 64 gigabytes somehow isn't it enough
for you the note sevens memory can be
expanded via microSD by up to 2
terabytes of course 2 terabyte microSD
cards don't exist yet so for now you can
get a 256 gigabyte card which should be
more than enough for even the biggest
storage users 6 USB type-c the
seven is the first flagship smartphone
from Samsung to dish the old time
standard microUSB and instead it comes
with the USB type-c USB type-c not only
offers faster data transfer speeds but
it also is reversible so you can plug it
in in either direction now one of the
biggest downsides of USB type-c is that
obviously you can't use your old micro
USB cables but luckily Samsung has you
covered making the switch easier by
including a micro USB to USB type-c
adapter in the note sevens box
good job Samsung seven bigger battery
the note five came with a three thousand
milliamp battery which was good enough
for most but not quite enough for what
you would expect I was such a big phone
so thankfully Samsung up the capacity on
the note sevens battery to thirty five
hundred milliamps which is impressive
given that it fits in a thinner body
given that the note 7 in the Galaxy s7
edge have similar specs including the
battery you should be able to get easily
a day or two out of a single charge
eight iris scanner in addition to the
fingerprint scanner the note 7 comes
with an iris scanner which does exactly
what it sounds like and scans your eyes
to unlock the phone samsung says that
the iris scanner is actually more secure
than a fingerprint scanner so if you
want the absolute best security method
available the note 7 has got you covered
I don't know how well it'll work when
it's really dark or if you're wearing
glasses but an iris scanner is some
James Bond so I'm looking forward
to it 9 secured folder samsung phones
have had a private mode for a while but
on the note 7 there's a new secured
folder which allows you to password
protect or iris protect not only your
photos and videos but even apps and
email accounts again James Bond chip 10
S Pen the S Pen got a pretty big upgrade
with the note 7 now having over 4,000
points of pressure compared to just
2,000 on the note 5 it also has a
thinner tip so precision is not going to
be a problem but it's not just hardware
the S Pen also comes with smarter
software that allows you to do things
like easily magnified create a Jif from
pretty much anything you like and can
even translate language for you on the
fly oh and you can't accidentally put it
in backwards which was an issue that
some people had with the note 5 alright
so there you have it those are the top
10 best new features on the note 7 we've
got a bunch of note 7 coverage
up soon so be sure you subscribe to the
channel if you haven't already give this
video a thumbs up if you liked it and as
always I'll see you in the very next
