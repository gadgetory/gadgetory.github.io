bham both calm and in this video i will
be doing a quick review on the windows
phone operating system giving you some
of the things that I like about it and
some of the things that I dislike about
it so I'm gonna start off with the
things I dislike so I can end on a
positive note the first thing that I
dislike what the phone our windows phone
shred say is the marketplace and the
reason why I just like the marketplace
isn't because the way it looks or the
way it functions is because of the lack
of app selection now a lot of the major
apps that I use on Android and both iOS
or on here such as angry birds is on
here fruit ninja those are suggest some
games of course Facebook is on here and
things like ESPN and Groupon and weather
channel are all in here but yet there is
some apps that I use on both iOS and on
Android that aren't yet in a marketplace
now that might change in the future and
as developers take Windows Phone more
seriously as more and more users start
using Windows Phone but as of right now
there the absolution just doesn't
compare to Android and iOS so it may or
may not be an issue for you but keep
that in mind the next thing that bothers
me with Windows Phone is the lack of app
functionality this may be due to the
fact that developers don't necessarily
develop their apps as much or for their
apps as much as they do on Android iOS
and you can't really blame them because
windows home represents such a small
percentage of their market but for
example go to alarm so this isn't even a
develop or a third party developer app
it's actually a nap you know that's a
stock that comes stock with the phone
and you can see that when i go to my
alarms options i have the ability to
change of time and the repeats in the
sound but i don't have the ability to
change the interval in which the snooze
time is so this is one of those things
that you'd expect from an alarm and yet
this one doesn't have it so of course i
might be able to download an app off the
market place that takes care of that
need but it just kind of goes to show
you that the functionality for whatever
reason seems to be a little bit less on
Windows Phone comparatively the next
thing that I have a complaint about is
the lack of universe
search so let's say I wanted to search
through for a song that I have on my
music player you think you'd press
search right here and just type in the
song day looking for but this only
searches the web through being and it's
a great service but it's not what I'm
looking for it doesn't search my apps it
doesn't search my my text messages and
it doesn't search my music so that's one
of the things that you know I've kind of
come to get used to with iOS and Android
both offering that functionality another
thing that might not be a big issue for
you but to me it is is the fact that you
can't turn off auto rotate so the auto
rotate is greater in here it's really
fast and responsive but you can't turn
it off no matter where you go you know
in the settings if you go under the
display under brightness you know
there's nothing here to do it and uh you
know I've searched those settings
through and through and I can't find any
option to turn auto race it rotate off
and the reason why I do that is because
sometimes you know late at night if I
get an email I want to check it while
I'm sleeping you know I'll take the
phone in on my side I'll use it and if
the phone rotates over it's kind of hard
to use it like this with one hand so
this is one of my complaints it's
something that I've gotten used to with
Android being able to turn that off but
again it might not be that big of deal
to you and for the most part you know as
long as you're awake and not trying to
sleep it is never good miss you alright
so the last thing that I really have a
complaint about is the notification bar
or the lack thereof you get your
notifications on these live tiles which
is great I mean the live tile system is
really nice but the problem I have is
not just the notifications but being
able to check my battery life so right
now I have no way to check well my
battery life is by looking at the top of
the screen I'd have to go into my
settings and go under battery use our
battery saver to be able to tell my
percentage which is forty-eight percent
now of course you could tap right here
on the top of the screen and this will
populate but I don't see any reason why
they would hide this other than maybe to
look a little bit more visually
appealing but to me that gets in the way
of functionality and it's definitely a
negative all right so enough of other
things that I don't like about Windows
Phone because honestly there's a lot
more to love then I dislike and the
first thing I'll show you is
going back to the marketplace now of
course I said that's something I dislike
but it kind of makes up for it in the
way in a way by letting me try apps out
so let me show you what I mean I'm going
to go ahead and go to let us go to fruit
ninja it's a game that cost 299 now on
android iOS you have to buy it in order
to play on this phone you can go try
unless of course there's you know
there's a free trial on android but most
of the time you know you don't have that
option in on Windows Phone every single
app every single game has the ability to
try it out first so it's downloading it
into my games folder and you know I
could play of course it's just a little
demo but being able to use it just a
little bit gives me a better idea of
whether or not i want to buy it and you
know it kind of just reduces returns for
the developers as well so that's
definitely something alike and while
we're here I want to talk about Xbox
Live because the Xbox Live integration
you know being a Microsoft product is
really nice to have on a phone I have
the ability to send our see who's online
which one of my xbox friends are online
be able to send them messages and you
know just seeing my own stats and things
of that nature so it's definitely
something cool something that is unique
to Windows Phone that isn't yet
available for iOS or Android and we're
not sure if it will be at all next thing
I want to talk about is the live tiles
so the live tiles kind of are similar to
widgets on Android but what school you
see my my people tab right here it has a
collection of my Twitter and my facebook
integrated which I'll go over in just a
second but you can see is flipping
through these pictures which is kind of
cool my music flips through the artists
my xbox live tile shows my little avatar
you know moving around and depending on
what tile you put on here they have
different sorts of functionality if they
don't they're just a standard icon like
this but definitely something I like
about Windows Phone and let's go ahead
and look at the facebook and twitter
integration within the OS so I'd have
been downloaded an app for facebook and
twitter our first I did but I realized
that the integration with indo-us itself
is better when I go over to my what's
new tab I get all my Twitter and
Facebook status updates right in here I
go over here to see my recent as far as
I was looking at of course I got almost
all my contacts right here with their
Facebook and Twitter za all linked up
and another great things I'll lock my
screen and show you the lock screen
actually shows me because integrate with
facebook and twitter it'll show me
someone's birthday so right now right
here you can see it's some one of my
friends birthdays and it really doesn't
give me an excuse to forget anybody's
birthdays in in the same way it'll show
you a calendar event such as you know a
dentist's appointment so with Windows
Phone I feel like I'll never really
forget something because every single
time i lock my phone boom i get a
reminder and i swipe up and you know I
make sure that I don't forget so it kind
of helps your productivity which is one
of the reasons why we get a smartphone
in the first place all right so I
switched back and forth between windows
phone and Android and iOS one thing that
I like about Windows Phone is the music
player I feel like the music players is
really well laid out it's really easy to
navigate you can press the letter on
here to see the whole alphabet and you
know go to whatever letter you want for
that artist or you can go buy albums by
songs and by playlist and all syncs up
with soon similar to the way that the
iphone does with itunes and another
thing that i like also is the picture
gallery so go ahead and try to see if i
could load up some of my pictures in
here so i'm gonna have my albums you
just go through them right here and
what's really cool is i have the ability
to you know look at maybe my one of my
albums or actually no better yet i could
sort them by date which is one my
favorite things so I'm able to actually
look at all the dates dating back to all
the oldest pictures into the newest
pictures that I have my phone so if I
wanted to see you know pictures from
November of 2007 I click click on it and
boom I have them right over there so
definitely a cool way to organize and
look through your pictures and of course
the pictures also update with your
Facebook so when you go into your
picture gallery anybody who uploads a
picture on facebook it'll show up there
as well speaking of pictures when you
use the camera what I really like is so
if I launch the camera right here so it
loads up if I wanted to go to my
pictures I can just swipe over to the
left and I go straight to my gallery so
this is a really nice way to be
able to you know go in and out of your
pictures and it's really fast something
that I really like and again you know
the whole fast name is really a window
phones all about that's why you see the
Microsoft Store or Microsoft employees
challenging you saying we'll give you a
hundred dollars or a thousand dollars if
you get beat us at a certain task so I
mean that's something I really want to
talk about to it's just the OS speed I
mean I don't know if you've been able to
notice throughout the review everything
I pretty much click on is just about
instant I mean when especially the
system apps like I said the browser
makes a difference as far as the process
goes I mean you can while you go slow or
you can only optimizing OS so much to
load a webpage but when i click on
pretty much any of the system apps such
as calculator or messaging and I've
compared it to my iphone I've compared
it to my galaxy nexus and Windows Phone
really does beat those other guys out
and what really helps the speed is the
multitasking so it's kind of similar to
ice cream sandwich now but when this one
had at first where you're able to
present hold on the back by and kind of
go through these windows kind of like
webos and way too of course you can't
close them out by flicking on them but
being able to switch in and out of apps
that easily it's a really nice and like
like I said there is no delay there is
no lag everything is almost instant when
you click on it on windows phone all
right so I want to finish up this review
let's talk about microsoft office really
quick because i think it's worth it to
talk about it obviously being a
microsoft phone you'd expect better word
excel in power a powerpoint experience
and you actually do get it i feel like
you have more functionality with the
word document with the excel documents
creator and you can just do a lot more
and again everything runs super smoothly
and I've been pretty happy with the way
it works one note is great i actually
used it to take notes and it's all syncs
up with Microsoft SkyDrive so when you
get a new one this one all I gotta do is
sign in to your live ID and everything
will be transferred back to your new
phone alright so the last thing I want
to talk about is the beauty of the OS I
feel like the OS is the best-looking OS
out of course that's a matter of opinion
but the reason why i like is because it
looks really nice all the apps look nice
on whether you're downloading facebook
or you're an xbox live everything is
consistent and all
so you have the ability to change the
theme so it's not much customization as
you get on Android but being able to
change it a little bit is nice um
something that you don't really get with
iOS but like I said definitely a
good-looking OS and definitely a fast us
and the last thing that I want to talk
about is I feel like you get a better
bang for your buck with Windows Phone
because of the fact that you don't need
a dual core a quad-core processor to be
running it manufactures are able to keep
the prices a little bit lower compared
to some of the higher-end androids or
iPhones out there because of the fact
that you don't need to put a quad-core
processor in there and they don't need
to put you know one gig of ram in there
of course they do have to pay at
Microsoft or Microsoft a licensing fee
do use it but other than that you know
their costs are relatively low so a lot
of times you'll find a phone like this
like the hd7 which is over a year old
I'm actually launched with Windows Phone
like I said it probably sells for free
at t-mobile if you can find them in
stock all right that's pretty much it
