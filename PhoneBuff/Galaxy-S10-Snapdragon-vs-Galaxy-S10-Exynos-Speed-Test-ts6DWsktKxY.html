year Samsung releases two different
variants of their flagship smartphone
they're really the only ones who do this
where in some countries at the US and
Canada they equip their phones with
Qualcomm chips which in this case is a
Snapdragon a 55 and then in most other
countries around the world they equip
their phones with their own in-house
chips this year being the Exynos 98 20
now for the most part samsung tries to
keep the two different versions of their
phones as equal as possible
however sometimes that isn't always the
case we had to call them out a few years
ago when the Exynos variant was just way
better but as of late they've been
pretty good about it that said these are
two completely different chipsets
there's only so much you can do to make
them perform the same so we have the
foam of style battery test underway
right now we'll be uploading that
shortly so be sure to subscribe if you
don't want to miss out on that
but in today's video we're gonna be
testing the performance or the speed on
both of these variants to see if there
actually is a difference and if so which
one is actually faster
so those awesome 3d graphics are part of
the new completely free-to-play game
from the sponsor of today's video in
rate shadow legends this game has an
amazing storyline giant boss fights and
hunters of Champions to collect and
customize just look at the detail on
these champions rate is getting big real
fast with an upcoming special launch
tournament with some crazy prizes and
they're hooking it up for those of you
who download the game using only my link
in the description to get 50,000 silver
immediately and a free champion all
right you know the drill will kick
things off by starting the stopwatches
on each phone and then jumping into the
first row where the Snapdragon variant
of the s10 gets the step over the Exynos
variant in facebook but both phones lit
up Starbucks at nearly identical rates
we'll see if there's any difference here
in Microsoft Word where each one will
have to load up the same 500 page
document and it looks like the
Snapdragon variant of the s10 did load
that app just a hair quicker allowing it
to slightly improve honestly as both
phones wrap up with excel at nearly
identical rates and move on to the
second row where I think we'll begin to
notice more of a difference between the
two if there actually is a difference
with snap see testing how quickly each
phone can export and edited photo where
it looks like the Snapdragon HD 5
variant of ES 10 does complete that task
at a faster rates pushing it further
ahead as we move on to the video
exporting portion of this test where
once again the Snapdragon a 55 variant
of the s10 outperforms its Exynos 98 20
counterparts giving it the biggest lead
it's had in this test so far we'll see
if the external Spherion can make a
comeback here and the browser test and
know the Snapdragon variant was faster
at loading up the Google trans website
as well putting it in a position to run
away with it here in the gaming row now
obviously sometimes there's gonna be
slight differences in how quickly a
phone will load up a certain app like
Facebook since different contents can be
displayed but that's why we always run
multiple trials for every smartphone
that we test and it's why we test so
many apps so that way one app can't make
all of the difference however in all of
our trial runs we did find that the
Snapdragon variant of the
10 was just a bit snappier in both the
first and the second rows and as you can
see here in the third row of games it's
the same exact story the Snapdragon a 55
variant loaded every game in the gaming
role at a faster rates allowing it to
pull a full up ahead as it begins
working on ESPN with the Exynos barian
finally joining it in the last row and
loading Spotify so it wasn't a big
advantage in any one app but a small
advantage in all the apps that allow the
Snapdragon bearing of the s10 to finish
the first off first with the time of 2
minutes and 2 seconds which is 10
seconds better than the 2 minutes and 12
seconds it took the Exynos variant to do
the same the Exynos variant did seem to
stutter a bit there while reopening
Amazon so while I don't think that any
of these phones will have issues keeping
all the apps open in the second lap I do
think it's worth paying attention to the
responsiveness of each phone as we
quickly switch from app to app so far
the Snapdragon variant has been pretty
responsive in every app which allows it
to finish the second lap in just 36
seconds with a total time of 2 minutes
and 39 while the X and O's variants
stuttered again there while exiting the
camera app and moving into excel pushing
it even further behind with the phone
taking an extra three seconds to
complete the second lap even though we
had all the apps technically open
completing the test with a total time of
two minutes and 51 seconds making the
winner and the faster Galaxy S 10 the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 variant anyways
that is it for me in this video thank
you guys for watching and as always I'll
see you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
