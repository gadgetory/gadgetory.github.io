david here and welcome back to another
episode of phone book you days the show
where I answer any of your questions
related or unrelated to mobile
technology every week to get your
questions answered in an upcoming video
be sure to follow us on Facebook and
Twitter I'll put the links you need down
below and just ask away this week we'll
be talking about the rumored HTC One max
how I got started making videos on
YouTube the pros and cons of physical
capacitive and on-screen buttons and the
name of the intro song you're about to
hear let's go ahead and get started
Diego asks what do you think about the
HTC one max rumors end do you think
it'll be better than the note 3 the
rumors so far about the HTC One max just
like the rumors with the note 3 are
really really exciting in terms of specs
based off all the leaked images
documents and teasers we've seen so far
the HTC One max looks to be a
super-sized version of the HTC One with
upgrading specs like a 5.9 inch full HD
display a two point three gigahertz
Snapdragon 800 processor and of course a
larger battery in the neighborhood of
3,000 plus milliamps whether or not the
HTC One max will be better than the note
3 will really come down to personal
preference just like with the galaxy s4
vs the HTC One but either way expect to
see 25 plus reasons why each is better
than the other Janine Johnston asks how
did you get started making YouTube
videos about cool tech I think the best
way I could answer that is just to tell
you what the path that led me to it so
it started me getting my first
smartphone which just made me fall
deeply in love with mobile technology I
mean I always loved technology in
general but it wasn't until I got that
first smartphone naturally that I really
got into mobile tech anyways I was
spending so much time researching
smartphones modding them and talking
about them that it only seemed natural
for me to get a job where I get paid in
the process which at first was for one
of the four major carriers here in the
US where worked for about two years
after that I started my own cell phone
accessory business and in the process of
launching that I thought I might as well
make a blog and post videos on youtube
so i could later use it to refer people
back to my accessory business but after
launching bomble com and
making a few videos I realized that I
just really love doing it so I decided
to stick with it and thanks to all you
guys to support now I will actually do
it for a living so thank you for your
support and I hope this answers your
question Jason asks do you think the HTC
One is still relevant today or should we
wait until the next successor from the
company oh absolutely the HTC One is
still relevant today with all those high
in specs and some of those innovative
features like boom sound I don't really
see any reason to wait for the one
successor HTC isn't even close to done
with the one end in fact it's still
rolling out to some carriers here in the
US so I'd say if you do for a new phone
and you like the HTC One then I'd go for
it otherwise if HTC is the company that
you really like and you want to be on
the cutting edge and you don't mind
having a really big bone then you can
wait and see what the one max is all
about but don't get stuck into the shop
up always waiting for a new phone
because as soon as one drops there's
always gonna be another one that's
rumored are announced next week or the
next month so my rule of thumb is only
by a phone if you're happy with exactly
what that phone is the day you buy it
and you'd be happy with it for one or
two years down the line so that way when
you get software updates the only kind
of like icing on the cake and you're
happy with it regardless hundreds upon
hundreds of you have asked what is your
intro song out of any question I've been
asked over the years this is the one
question that's been asked the most so
I'll answer it once and only once right
here and right now you ready the name of
the song is 49 sent blaze it's a royalty
free song license from smartsound I hope
you enjoy it I asked you via phone book
comms poll do you prefer physical
capacitive or on-screen buttons and it
seems like there's no clear favorite
between you guys with thirty one percent
of you preferring on-screen buttons like
on Nexus devices twenty-five percent of
you saying you prefer capacitive buttons
like under the Lumia 1020 twenty-one
percent of you said you'd rather have
physical buttons like on the iPhone and
finally twenty four percent of you said
you rather have some combination of the
above obviously based off the results
each button style has its advantages
on-screen buttons have the advantage of
being able to change whether that's
disappearing completely are moving into
landscape with you when you rotate your
device and they also allow for a larger
screen to phone ratio with thinner
bezels like on the Moto X in the g2
physical buttons like on the eye of
only you turn your screen on without
having to reach for the power button and
it's usually easier to find when you're
not looking at your phone because well
you can physically feel them capacitive
buttons aren't as prone to damage as
physical buttons are and of course
having a combination of physical and
capacitive buttons kind of give you the
best of both worlds but in my opinion I
think the best layout which doesn't
really exist right now would be
on-screen buttons with the swipe feature
or swipe to turn the screen on feature
on the blackberry z10 that's me on an
Android or even a Windows Phone would be
absolutely awesome but then again that's
just my opinion alright guys that's
pretty much it for me in this episode of
phone bluff q and A's remember that this
