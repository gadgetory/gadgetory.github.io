galaxy s7 and galaxy s 8 the galaxy s 9
is being powered by two different
chipsets if you live in a country like
the US or China you get a Galaxy S 9
powered by qualcomm snapdragon age 45
whereas if you live in most other
countries Eurus 9 is being powered by
Samsung's own Exynos 98 10 now while
both of these chipsets have a lot in
common and they're similar in a lot of
ways they're both based off of Samsung's
10 nanometer process there are some
significant differences they're using
different cpus different GPUs and the
software and each phone may be optimized
a little bit differently as well which
begs the question is one variant of the
galaxy s 9 faster than the other let's
find out all right you know the drill
we'll start the stopwatch is on each
phone and jump right into the first row
of system apps where the Exynos variants
is able to launch the camera faster but
is slower and loading the photo in the
gallery allowing the Snapdragon bearing
to take the lead where it gets hung up
in facebook letting the Exynos pull
right back ahead so a lot of going back
and forth to start off this speed test
but going into Photoshop the two phones
are close and heading into premiere
they're practically neck-and-neck which
actually lines up perfectly for us to be
able to see the difference each chip set
makes here in processing this clip where
the snapdragon 845 seems to just
outmuscled the Exynos 9810 with it
already moving on to the gaming row but
it's not like the Exynos variant has
fallen too far behind it's still right
there in it and it'll be interesting to
see if we can make up some ground here
in one of these games but so far it
looks like the opposite is happening
with the snapdragon variant showing us
that what it did in premiere wasn't just
a fluke with it loading full of subway
surfers and flip diving at a faster rate
adding on to his lead and looking to
pull a full app ahead so very
interesting results so far I honestly
didn't expect the Snapdragon variant to
pull ahead in these heavy-duty apps
considering that last year the two
chipsets performed roughly the same and
the year before that DX nose actually
had the advantage but with the
Snapdragon 845 powered s9 pulling almost
two to three apps ahead
I think it's safe to say that the
excellence variance won't be making a
comeback here in this first lab with the
Snapdragon a 45 barian just about done
with it loading both the mobile and full
versions of the audible websites
clocking in a time of 1 minute and 27
seconds meanwhile the excellence variant
finishes up with Netflix and starts
working on the browser test which it
actually looks like it's loading at a
faster rate but not quite fast enough
with it taking a full 11 seconds longer
to finish the first lap so a pretty big
difference between the two phones I'm
not sure if this is strictly a hardware
thing or if it has to do with software
optimization but we ran this test dozens
of times like we do all of our speed
tests and these results were consistent
with a Snapdragon Farion of the s9 plus
finishing first with a total time of 1
minute and 53 seconds and with us
fast-forwarding the Exynos to the finish
line where it completes the test with a
total time of 2 minutes and 6 seconds
making the winner and the faster Galaxy
S 9 the Snapdragon 85 barians so before
we take a look at the individual app
load of times I want to give a big
thanks to honey for sponsoring today's
episode now if you ever heard of honey
before it's a free browser extension
that automatically finds you coupons
from all over the web to help you always
get the best deal while you shop online
one thing I've learned over the years is
it's a really good idea to search for a
coupon before you check out but the
problem is at least for me I don't
always remember to do it right like
sometimes something calls like 5 or 10
bucks and you don't think about it or if
you do half the time the coupons you end
up finding don't end up working and you
end up wasting a bunch of your time but
with honey you don't really have to
worry about it because it's all
automated let me show you how it works
so first thing you need to do is
download it so you just go to join honey
calm slash poem buff you hit add honey
and then you click install like that's
literally it now let's go to one of my
favorite websites and add something to
the cart hit apply coupons and boom
honey found a coupon in automatically
applied it for me so like you literally
don't have to do anything and you just
save money so click on that link down
below in the description to add honey to
your browser for free or go to join
honeycomb / foam buff and start saving
money today alright here are the
individual app a lot of times from that
first slap where you can see that in
pretty much every heavy dude
and most of the lightweight apps the
Snapdragon 845 Berrien of the galaxy s 9
I'll perform the X and O's variants
sometimes pretty significantly anyways
that is it for me in this video thank
you guys for watching and as always I'll
see you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
