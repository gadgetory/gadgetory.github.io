this will show you the camera app on
android 4.1 jelly bean I did a fall and
review on the channel but i forgot to
mention the camera so go ahead and show
you that now go ahead and open this guy
up and i'll take a few pictures of this
little android guy and i'll show you the
main difference so I see as you can see
everything else looks the same but when
you take a picture it actually makes a
little animation so I'd from the picture
over to the right and what schools
instead of just having to press this guy
you could actually swipe over so kind of
like Windows Phone if you're right here
taking a picture you could swipe over to
the right and actually look at all the
pictures that you take in previously so
obviously all my pictures look the same
i'll go ahead and make a take a few
different looking picture so just turn
this guy over a little alright so that's
one feature I'm really the main
difference but the other thing that's
really cool it's not only can you you
know get in and out of the camera like
this but you could actually pinch out
and see all your pictures at once so
it's a pretty cool way to filter through
all your photos but not only that say
for example I don't really like this
photo I can just swipe it up and delete
it now you can see how the bottom says
deleted but I wanted to undo it I can
just tap on this little undo button but
definitely a cool way you know it goes
with the whole Ice Cream Sandwich jelly
bean theme of being able to swipe things
to delete them and makes the camera a
lot more easy to use and a little bit
more intuitive but anyways sit for me in
this video if you found it helpful
please hit the like button and subscribe
