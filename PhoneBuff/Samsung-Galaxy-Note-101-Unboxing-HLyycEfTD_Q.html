calm and instead of doing an unboxing of
the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 before I go
ahead and open this guy up let's go
ahead and take a look at the Box got
these serial numbers in that side
nothing but the Galaxy Note logo here
nothing on this side but the Samsung
website and on the back says Samsung
Galaxy Notes gets a list of the some of
the features like the 1280 by 800 TFT
screen got the quad-core 1.4 gigahertz
akeno's processor 5 megapixel camera on
the back 1.9 mix well like it is on the
galaxy s3 on the front 7 thousand
million battery and of course the s-pen
but that's enough of the boxes go ahead
and find out what's inside of it I
already cut the little seals before I
did it so first thing we're gonna be met
with is the galaxy note itself so you
can see it takes up the whole box let's
go ahead and try to pull this guy out
use this little tab alright so here is
the tablet you see it has a little
sticker on it says high-precision input
with s-pen Adobe Photoshop Touch Smart
Remote 1.4 gigahertz processor like I
said before I'm gonna be giving into all
of that in the review and other videos
but for now let's take a look at it the
back same seals and everything go ahead
and put this over here
actually that's not gonna work I'll put
it on the side really quick let's find
out what else is in the box so we open
it up got the wall charger we have this
all there you go so this is the other
side of it this is the adapter for this
guy it slides in here so hold this guy
out you see slides out like that so I
think that's how you do it
yeah so you go like that and you put it
in you've got the you know typical
warranty and user guide right over here
you have I don't even know what this is
right now but yeah you have this thing
and you have this charger right here so
you see the USB it's not your typical
microwaves beast more of like a Samsung
one I can see right over here I'll go
ahead and take it out of the plastic
better look at that there you go so you
see the end it's not my career speed
looks like that and that's the way you
charge the tablet underneath here noting
the empty box so let's go ahead and move
that out and try to figure out what this
is but in the meantime I'm gonna go
ahead and put this down bring the tablet
back in here so here's the tablet and
we'll go ahead and power it on so the
power button is right over here at the
top left wall depending on how you hold
it if you hold it in landscape is top
left hold on the you know like this is
like the normal Samsung location let's
go ahead and remove this film so look at
that beautiful 10 inch screen that you
guys see the boot up animation really
quick so you can see the tablet you know
very thin I mean that's my first
impression but it feels a lot I don't
know a lot thinner than the other
tablets I don't know if it is but it
just feels that way I think it's got the
curved you know edges on here very
lightweight go ahead and hit start says
connect to a Wi-Fi network I'll go ahead
and do that I'll enter my password and
off screen
alright so entered that guy and I'm
connected hit next and select the date
next and I'll skip this for now I wanna
make a Samsung Account right now I'll
not even enter my Google account right
now I just want to get to the home
screen
who's this belong to David Rahimi next
no thanks I don't want Dropbox right now
maybe I'll do it later
alright so we're finally at the home
screen so you see you got you know
Android Ice Cream Sandwich on here and
with the touch of TouchWiz is the way
Samsung puts it trying to make you know
clever marketing but right now you can
see everything's kind of loading up so
it kind of lacked right there but it's
the first startup so it's installing and
you know I'm packaging everything so
gotta give it some time you tap the top
right to get to your applications looks
just like TouchWiz on the galaxy s3
really I'll go ahead and show you I
think I had the same on I on the same
wall boy ever but it looks the same so
anyways that is how the Start screen
looks
she widgets over here you're seeing a
lot more widgets at once obviously than
he would on a phone to hit to go to home
yet they hit over here to get back you
tap the back button multitasking and
screenshot button right over here so
that's pretty cool to have that right
there see it says saving screenshot if I
want to look at it I could probably tap
over here and get the notification bars
that are normally get instead of having
to drive from the top so a little bit
different but anyway that's a quick
overview and an unboxing of the Samsung
Galaxy Note 10.1 of course I'll be doing
a review I'm already doing comparisons
to the Nexus 7 I'll be doing comparisons
of course to the third generation iPad
and a whole bunch more so stay tuned if
