smartwatches like the pebble the so many
smartwatches or like the Samsung Galaxy
gear here bring some very unique and
exciting new features to the table or to
say to your wrist that makes your
traditional watch feel sort of like a
fancy looking flip phone but on a
serious note smartwatches can really add
some value to your digital experience
but at the same time they're not for
everybody and they do have their
downsides so in this video I'll be going
over seven reasons to consider a
SmartWatch and hopefully by the end
you'll have a better idea as to whether
or not actually getting one is the smart
choice for you let's go ahead and get
right into it
so reason number one to consider a
SmartWatch is that although most people
will agree that traditional watches are
much more stylish than the current crop
of smartwatches available smartwatches
have at least one major advantage in the
fashion department and that you can
change the clock base to better match
the outfit you're currently wearing
but if color coordination isn't quite
your thing or this isn't enough for you
to consider a SmartWatch fashionable
maybe the fact that on some models you
can customize the clock face to look
virtually however you want is a
compelling enough reason on its own to
probably the biggest reason to consider
eight smartwatches how it improves the
way you get your everyday notifications
not only does it save you the hassle of
having to pull your phone out of your
pocket or purse each and every time you
get a notification it also helps ensure
that you don't miss one either with it
still alerting you even when you're away
from your phone like when you're in the
next room for example or when you're in
a loud environment where a ringing and
vibrating phone isn't always enough to
catch your attention but a vibrating
watch right on your wrist definitely is
three okay so speaking of notifications
on a SmartWatch like the Samsung Galaxy
gear with its built-in microphone and
speaker you can actually make and answer
phone calls and talk to someone right
there on the watch with it acting like a
little speakerphone now well I wouldn't
really want to have a long conversation
with someone while using a watch it's
still pretty convenient for those short
1 to 2 minute calls for a SmartWatch
wouldn't
it'd be a SmartWatch without a set of
accompanying apps and the major
SmartWatch is available right now
all have dozens if not hundreds of apps
available with more more being added
every month but don't let that fool you
into thinking that you'll want to use
some of the absolute doing your phone on
your SmartWatch because at least at this
point most apps are better left to be
used on your smartphone with its much
bigger screen and better hardware
however there are a few apps that
actually work really well on a
SmartWatch now of course the obvious
ones like a timer or stopwatch are good
but that's kind of expected given that
even some traditional watches out there
have those things so what I found to be
really useful and would probably even
miss harder to stop using a SmartWatch
are apps like media controller where you
can control the music or videos playing
on your phone wherever your watch which
is great for situations like when you're
at the gym listening to music and you
don't want to pull your phone out of
your pocket every time you want to
change the song another app that I found
useful was the phone locator or find
phone app on the Galaxy gear and the
SmartWatch 2 where if you misplaced your
phone somewhere in your house or at work
for example you can just open up the app
on your Smart Watch and your phone will
start ringing regardless of whether or
not you left it on silent and you can
start tracking it down and then finally
the app that I've personally just fallen
in love with which right now is only
available in the Galaxy gear because of
this microphone and speaker is the voice
memos app with the convenience of being
able to record a voice memo right then
and there on the watch I found myself
making more voice memos than I normally
would have otherwise which resulted in
me forgetting things less often so it
definitely tops my list of favorite
SmartWatch apps at least for right now
but considering that the app development
for smartwatches has only really just
begun there's no telling what these
devices will eventually be able to do so
my favorite app in a couple of months
from now might just be something
entirely different
either way knowing that the
functionality of these smartwatches will
only improve with time it's something
that has me really excited the fifth
reason to consider a SmartWatch is the
camera now at the moment the galaxy gear
is the only SmartWatch that has a camera
but there are rumors of other camera
cracking
my watches that are allegedly on their
way so we'll have to wait and see on
that but honestly out of any of the
reasons to consider a SmartWatch the
camera for the sole purpose of taking
pictures and recording videos is
probably one of the weakest because if
you really wanted to take a picture of
video of something you'd be much better
off using your smartphone where the
quality would easily trump the quality
on the gear or any other SmartWatch
camera for that matter but that's not
why I included the Cameron list instead
the camera makes a list for a couple of
other reasons for one a SmartWatch
camera is easily accessible because it's
right there in your wrist so instead of
having to reach into your pocket or
purse if you really need to take a
picture of something quickly it's more
watch camera despite its lower level of
quality may just end up being your best
bet the second advantage to having a
camera on the smartwatches or its future
potential with apps like barcode
scanners and the like and then of course
the only other reason to have a camera
on your SmartWatch is so that you can
pretend to be a secret agent like
double-oh-seven or something and fulfill
some of your childhood dreams or is that
just me 6 another feature that I found
particularly useful is one that's again
at least for right now only available on
the Galaxy gear in the auto lock feature
with this feature enabled your Samsung
compatible smartphone will automatically
lock with your preset password when the
Galaxy gear isn't in range or if it's
turned off and when the Galaxy gear is
in range or it is connected the phone
will automatically disable the password
and let you all mock your phone with
just a simple swipe which is super
convenient if you're let's have a person
who password protects our phone the
seventh and final reason is
consideration our watch at least for
this video is once again a feature
that's currently exclusive to the Galaxy
gear in voice controls mainly because
the gear has a more powerful processor
than the others and is also the only
major SmartWatch with a built-in mic so
unlike the pebble the Sony SmartWatch to
end even the upcoming Qualcomm talk the
gear has voice controls where you can
send text messages set alarms and timers
add calendar events create tasks and
even a spur weather forecasts all by
just talking to your SmartWatch with
as voice and it's actually pretty cool
and definitely something worth
considering but the unfortunate thing
about it is it's not the full-fledged s
voice that you would get on your Samsung
smartphone and it's really limited
mostly to the things I just mentioned
now even though I'm not necessarily a
fan of s voice I still think that
Samsung really left a lot on the table
by not making s voice fully featured on
the Galaxy gear and I think that if
Samsung can push out an update to fix
this or if a company like Google or
Apple come out with their own SmartWatch
featuring either Google now or Siri the
value proposition for smartwatches
will be much much greater than it is
today alright guys that about wraps up
my list of reasons to consider a
SmartWatch and obviously not every
reason is going to be a reason for you
and all these reasons combined may or
may not be enough to outweigh the
drawbacks like the cost and the lesson
stellar battery life but hopefully this
video has given you a better idea of
what a SmartWatch can potentially bring
to the table and at the very least got
you a little bit more excited about what
the feature of smartwatches holds
anyways thank you for watching the video
and I'll see you guys in the very next
video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
