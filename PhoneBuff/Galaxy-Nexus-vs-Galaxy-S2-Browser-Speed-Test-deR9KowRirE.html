calm and today I'm redoing a quick video
comparison between the browsers on the
Galaxy Nexus and the samsung galaxy s2
in this case the epic touch 4g so with
that said I will go ahead and launch
both the browsers i clear them both out
and there's no apps running in the
background so I cleared the history
there's no answering the background and
they're both on the same Wi-Fi
connection so basically it says equals
everything can be with that said it's
worth mentioning that the Nexus
obviously has android ice cream sandwich
which gives it a software advantage and
the only vintage outside epic could have
over the Nexus is the resolution is a
little bit lower so it might be able or
might help the performance there but
they usually applies more so to gaming
alright so engadget i'll hit go at the
same time if i can so you see the Galaxy
Nexus is already finished loading and
the galaxy s2 is now done let's take a
little bit longer for the galaxy s2
normal usually I see it go faster than
that I'll go ahead and do desktop and
i'll tell you when the Galaxy Nexus done
it's kind of hard to see that blue bar
on that background are in this case the
galaxy s2 looks like it finished just
before the Galaxy Nexus that's too close
to call will do NFL com
all right i'll hit at the same time and
it's going to load the mobile site
Galaxy Nexus done and i'll scroll down
and now the galaxy s2 is done so we'll
go to the full website and si has a lot
of content on it so Galaxy Nexus is done
and the epic is still going there you go
and I will load up one more site will do
I yahoo com
all right try it go at the same time
again and that the nexus is done and the
epic is still going and we'll do the
full site for yahoo now it's worth
mentioning also that this guy is loading
flash so because flash isn't supported
yet on the Galaxy Nexus so that is going
to be slowing it down a little bit and
the Nexus is done while the s2 is
finished now so the cosmetics is
definitely faster and from my experience
using both of devices the Galaxy Nexus
does outperform it let's go ahead and
test the multi-touch see how well they
respond so we see it's really smooth on
the Galaxy Nexus arm sorry at the galaxy
s2 and now we'll do it on the Galaxy
Nexus honestly it looks a little bit
smoother on the s2 I mean they're both
really really smooth but i'd say the s2
does look a little bit smoother but it's
pretty much it for this browser
comparison this is David phonebook calm
