and in this video we're talking about a
whole bunch of Windows Phone 8 news
namely the announcement of three new
devices to butcher from Nokia one of
which is from Samsung being the samsung
eighths of s the Nokia Lumia 820 and
Nokia Lumia 920 so the successors to the
800 and 900 out of the three imma talk
about first the one I'm most excited
about and that's the Nokia Lumia 920 you
may ask why my most excited about it
well let's take one look at the
specifications first of all this guy has
a 4.5 inch puremotion hd+ display
promotion HD Plus basically means as an
IPS display with a resolution of 1280 by
768 so it's not the typical 1280 by 720
like you've seen on devices like the
galaxy s3 galaxy nexus etc but it's 1280
by 768 giving you a pixels per inch of
332 so significantly higher than some of
those other devices that we've seen and
on top of all that you have Gorilla
Glass so the screens can be nice in
scratch resistant but the screen isn't
the only thing that has me excited it's
the processor for the first time we're
seeing dual-core processors on a windows
phone which is really nice especially
considering the fact that is 1.5
gigahertz Snapdragon s4 so this is the
same processor to assault on the galaxy
s3 and some variances HTC one x given it
great performance on Android I can only
imagine what's going to do on Windows
Phone 8 comes with one gigabyte of ram
so doubled up from last year and 32
gigabytes of internal storage the only
drawback out say is the thickness of the
Lumia and that's the kind of the same
complaint of how the 900 is the
thickness basically it's ten point seven
millimeters thick it's a little bit
thicker than some of the other devices
I've seen out there so that's kind of a
drawback but you're getting a premium
design the device weighs a little bit
more than normal to its 185 grams I know
some other devices out there like 135
grams but hey I'm not going to complain
it cuz imma get nice premium build
quality with these great specifications
but I'm not done yet another great thing
about this phone is the camera it has a
8.7 megapixel carl zeiss lens PureView
camera with optical image stabilization
so basically you can be recorded
walking down the street and it's not
going to be jumping and shaking
everywhere it's gonna look nice and
smooth like a wood on a professional
camcorder basically is the first time
we've seen on smartphones it's going to
be finally recording and 1080p before
Windows Phone 7.5 is recording in 720p
which is the main reason why I never
really used my you know Lumia 900 or my
focus s to record videos from face
around this guy has a 720p camera so
that's pretty good as well the battery
is 2,000 milliamps which would be more
than enough to power you through the day
and the colors that it comes in is
yellow red white grey and black the
battery isn't removal by the way and we
don't have a price or it released it
just yet but I'm expecting sometime in
November school on to the next device
let's look at the little brother of the
Nokia Lumia 920 which nokia themselves
that is the flagship phone so the little
brother of the flagship phone the 820 is
a 4.3 inch clear black amoled display
with the same old resolution is all from
last year's model at 800 x 480 giving
you people have just 216 really not you
know something to be excited about
honestly kind of disappointing but
thankfully some of the other spies have
been improved like the processor same
processor as in 920 the Snapdragon s4
got one view by the RAM only 8 gigabytes
of internal storage but it has an
expandable microSD card slot which the
920 does not so that's pretty cool the
thickness is a little bit less than the
920 as well at just nine point nine
millimeters weighing less to at 160
grams it's sixteen fifty million battery
should be enough to get you through the
day considering its up AMOLED display
with the black you know background
you'll be saving more choose smaller
screens I can take as much power so
should it be an issue by the way both
the Nokia Lumia 920 and the 820 have NFC
capabilities they have bluetooth 3.0 and
also wireless charging so you'd be able
to set them down on the little wireless
charger kind of like you saw on the palm
pre from you know a couple of years ago
but really nice to be able to do that
you know especially if you're in the
dark at night you check it text message
or email on your phone you can just set
it down stead of trying to have to find
that little micro SD poor micro USB port
which is almost impossible to find an
item so anyway that is the lumia series
the next one I want to talk about is the
Samsung 80s
this one is basically it's a samsung
galaxy s3 converted to Windows Phone 8
so you have that same four point eight
inch AMOLED HD display giving you a ppi
of 306 you have 1.5 gb Snapdragon s4
processor like I said before one gig ram
60 gigabytes of internal storage
expandable up to 32 key west for a
microSD card slot it's only eight point
seven millimeters thick so this is going
to be a big you know selling point if
you don't want that thick Nemea phone
the samsung a device might be the one
for you because it's a lot thinner wait
lot less at 135 grams so pretty much you
know the weight that i mentioned earlier
2300 milliamp battery so that's going to
be you know a lot bigger better than it
is on the Lumia 900 or 920 HRSA and the
820 and should be more than enough to
get you throughout the day it also has
NFC and Bluetooth 3.0 the camera on this
guy is 8 megapixels and records in 1080p
the front facer is 1.9 megapixel the
front-facing recording capability of 700
720p alright so something I forgot to
mention about the Nokia Lumia 820 is the
battery on that guy is actually
removable just like it is on the samsung
each of s and the camera on it is a mega
pixels but it doesn't have that same
optical image stabilization features
that you see on the 920 so keep that in
mind the price should be lower as a
result but it doesn't have those
high-end pictures so if you're looking
for a smaller device you're not going to
get that same camera capability which is
kind of unfortunate but anyways those
are the three new windows phone 8
devices are gonna be coming out like I
said we don't have a release date on the
920 and we don't have it on the 820 or
the h of s actually we don't have
pricing for any of the devices but I'm
guessing you know somewhere around two
hundred dollars maybe 150 or less for
the 820 I don't really expect the 820 to
be seen stateside but hey maybe it will
be um but that's pretty much it for me
in this video you know just wanted to
give you guys and use really excited
about it ma'am I really can't wait to
use the devices and you know pit them
against phones like the samsung galaxy
s3 the new iphone that is going to be
coming out later on this month and see
how they fare because Windows Phone you
know it's pretty much been you know like
in third place as far as the three major
operating systems windows phone 8 you
really give it a kick and with finally
some high
and devices it's really going to make
difference but anyway that's it for me
in this video let me know what you think
in the comments below let me know if
you're excited about the Lumia if you
maybe wanted another feature if the size
is too big whatever it is let me know
I'll try to get back to you as soon as I
can wet thank you for watching the video
