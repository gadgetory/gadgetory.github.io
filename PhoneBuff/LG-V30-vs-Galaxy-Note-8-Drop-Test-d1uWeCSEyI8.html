have been asking for the LGV 30 drop
test you've been messaging me on
Facebook you've been leaving comments
here on YouTube so here it is today
we're gonna be doing a foam love solid
drop test with the feed 30 we're gonna
be dropping it side by side next to
arguably its biggest competitor in the
galaxy notes 8 but before we get to the
test I want to give a big thanks to tech
21 for making this video possible so
when we tested the Evo check case for
the LG V 30 and handled the back corner
and face drops without a problem
tech 21 protects drop after drop with
the V 30 we tested still looking
flawless tech 21 cases are drop tested
20 times to ensure durability and
long-lasting protection to be able to
withstand the multiple drops that occur
in the everyday use of a smartphone the
Evo check case is available for both the
LG v 30 and the Galaxy Note 8 in a
number of different colors so click on
that link down below in the description
and get your phone the protection it
deserves all right let's get to dropping
round number one backdrop in three two
one alright so after that backdrop both
phones pass our ten point inspection and
remain fully functional but cosmetically
there's no contest the V 30 surprisingly
survives the backdrop with almost no
visible damage while the note 8 has its
rear glass completely shattered so a
really impressive result for the V 30
and an easy win for it here in round
number one round number two corner drop
in three two one
after that corner drop both phones have
their aluminum band scuffed but because
the bands are all metal without any kind
of layering over top of them
the scuffs honestly don't look all that
bad and neither phone really did better
than the other year making it a draw in
round number two round number three face
drop in three two one
alright so that face drop crack the
glass on the front of both phones but
the result on the Galaxy Note 8 does
look better with the majority of the
cracks being contained in just two
corners which may or may not be due to
it having curved edges the V 30 on the
other hand suffers more significant
cracking with a shattered glass of top
distorting the selfie cam giving the
edge to the note aids in round number
three bonus round okay so with bull
phones still being technically usable we
entered the bonus round where we drop
each phone directly onto steel from much
higher up which should put the shock and
impact resistance of each phone to the
test
last time the Galaxy Note 8 was able to
survive not one not two but all 10 bonus
drops while the glass in the front and
the back of the phone did take a beating
most of the display itself remains
undamaged except for on the edges
however unfortunately after doing our
ten point inspection we found that no
matter what we did we couldn't get the
camera or the flash to work
so a decent results but not necessarily
the best let's see if the V 30 can fare
any better three two one see doesn't
make a lot of noise because this phone
is so lightweight and still looks like
it's working
cool three two one good drop is the
result good ooh alright so we have a
little dimple in the screen here
obviously way more shattering the back
doesn't have any shattering between some
phones that shatter on the back after
all this impact flip the backs holding
up nicely the screen
looks like it's working and pretty much
all the corners so let's go on cheer up
whoo ooh that one hurt that one hurt um
nothing much I mean same story a little
bit more like little fractures in the
glass but it's still responding so this
thing is doing really well and drop ten
drops can you do ten bonus shops three
two one
whoo the hoenn sounded the worst - did
it do it and yep looks like it is still
fully functional at least the
touchscreen is okay so the v30 also
survived all 10 bonus drops and while
the front glass looks really bad the
rear glass still remains in perfect
condition and unlike on the note 8 the
rear camera and the flash still work
however the wide-angle camera on the
back did get damaged with it unable to
focus on anything you can actually see
what looks like the camera housing at
the bottom of the viewfinder so what the
lens may have gotten somewhat dislodged
the display itself though still remains
fully responsive to the touch however
when you lock and unlock the phone you
do get this flicker that happens and
what's weird is if you keep the
always-on display option turned on in
the settings the screen won't turn back
on after you lock it you have to like
fully restart the phone to get the
screen to come back on again but if you
disable the always-on display option
this doesn't happen and it works just
fine
so a really interesting result all right
before we take a look at the scorecard
let's quickly review our new scoring
method because man we needed one so from
now on the scores will be based only off
of how a phone performs relative to the
phone it's being compared to and not off
of any other phone from other drop tests
the winner of each round will receive 10
points with the loser scoring anywhere
between 6 and 9 points depending on how
much worse it did if two phones perform
similarly each phone will be given 10
points and after all four rounds the
scores will be tallied up to determine
an overall winner anyways let's get to
the scorecard in the first round
declared
went to the v30 whose glass remained
fully intact the bones tied in the
second round and the third the no.28
suffered less damage on the front and
then finally in the fourth while the
notates display looked better the V 30s
camera and flash still worked
contributing to the V 30s higher overall
score making it the winner here in this
drop test anyways that is it for me in
this video thank you guys for watching
and as always I'll see you in the very
next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
