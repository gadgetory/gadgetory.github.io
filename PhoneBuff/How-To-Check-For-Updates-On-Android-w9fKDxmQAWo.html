and in this video I'm gonna show you how
to check for updates on your Android
phone so we're gonna do it on most
phones is go over to your settings and
then scroll down to the bottom where it
says about phone and then from here at
the very top because you have an option
for system updates lip or something
along those lines hit it and then you
have the option to hit check now you
might be able to put bottom or the top
depending on your phone you might have
to hit menu in the hit check now by as
you can see I check for an update right
now obviously I don't have one available
because nothing's popping up I'm going
to get home and show you what it looks
like on another phone so I have a
Android 2.3 phone over here the last one
was the ICS 4.0 phone so this one it
works the same way but instead of
actually going to about phone you can
see I have an option to hit system
updates right here now I'm going to tap
on the sky you can see I have a few
options
I get update PRL profile from where now
these things I don't necessarily need a
mess with because these are more or less
for the network but when you hit update
LG software because it's a lg phone it's
actually going to check for software
updates for Android itself obviously
there's no updates at all for this one
either but just in case your phone
doesn't have this option available in
the settings or if you want to check it
another way you can go to the dialer and
type in this code so what you're gonna
type in is star pound star pound and
then you can type in the word check in
so you're gonna spell it out on the
dollar slow see age e c k i and so it
starts up to four three two five four
six and now you gonna have the same code
again but backwards instead of star
pound starting to do pound store pound
star you can see I actually went away by
itself and it says check in succeeded up
here at top that's because it's checking
in with the network to see if there's
any updates obviously again nothing
popped up so it up in the updates but
that's pretty much it for me in this
video if you found it helpful please hit
