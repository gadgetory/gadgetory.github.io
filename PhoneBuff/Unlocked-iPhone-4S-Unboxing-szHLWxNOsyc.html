calm and I know this one's been out
forever but I'm just gonna do an
unboxing this is a brand new iPhone 4s
this is the unlocked version so I got
this from the Apple store and I'm going
to open up myself the little plastic on
it so go ahead and open this guy up
there you go take this plastic layering
off alright so got the box course I says
I've compressed looks really nice open
this guy up by sliding up and there you
go we've got the iPhone 4s so I got the
black version because I have a white
version so I wanted to get a black one
you can see it's got a little plastic
lettering on the front also has a little
plastic thing on the back to make sure
you know there's no fingerprints or
damage on it when it's pat when it's
shipping of course you guys all know the
iPhone how it looks to do a quick walk
around really quick just in case you
don't somehow anyway there's the iPhone
and a little bat cartridge that holds
the phone you pull this guy out and
you've got a little book oh here's the
little door for the SIM card art key for
the SIM card door - I'll pull it out so
it looks like a little paper clip go pay
per click paper clip almost if I could
speak correctly you just take that guy
in right there into that little hole and
I'll pop that guy out so gives you
little directions how to do that and it
says fingertips pretty catchy got your
Apple stickers which is pretty cool if
you want to stick that on your iPhone I
wouldn't do it but maybe on your
computer or something and just regular
instructions and tips anyway put this
guy side on the inside of the box you've
got your USB wall adapter
got your USB to the you know typical
iPhone iPod iPad adapter on multi color
but and then you've got your iPod ear
buds in here so you could plug it into
your phone and has a little volume
regular pull this guy out so you see
it's also got the volume get a poet used
to this
but anyway get the microphone everything
here
we'll just got real quick show you what
that looks like and hold this guy oh
this one's actually like hard to get out
all right
that little USB adapter and go straight
into the wall and that's pretty much it
me that's all that comes in the phone
but what else could you really ask for I
mean the battery's internal and again
here's the iPhone go ahead and pull off
plastic covering so it's not like your
typical plastics more like I don't know
it's a little bit thicker mucho anyway
here's the other side and now you can
see how shiny this iPhone looks see how
long I could actually keep this guy
looking this well but anyway that's
pretty much it from this video I just
wanted to give you guys a quick unboxing
