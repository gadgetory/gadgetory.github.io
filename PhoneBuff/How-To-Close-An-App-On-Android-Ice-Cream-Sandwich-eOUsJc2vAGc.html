today we're doing a video that answers
the question that a lot of you can ask
me lately and that's does the Galaxy
Nexus close out an app when you flick it
off the screen like this does it
actually close the app some people will
say yeah it does some people say no it
doesn't well today you're going to find
out what it really does and honestly the
answer is kind of in between and I'll
show you why so I've really loaded BGR
on my browser and you can see it doesn't
load at all I just tap the browser icon
and it pops up to where I was same thing
with color note so I'll open up this
note i made go back I'll go to the
browser go back and go back to color
note and you can see the note is open
but if I close out the browser will go
back and see what happens so in this
case it actually close the browser and
went to my home page so presumably it
close the app out and I believe it will
do the same with color note and it did
but sometimes for example on the browser
it doesn't close out the app so let's
see if I could get it to do it I'll load
up fumble calm all right and you can see
it's loaded up completely and I'll do
the same thing just close it from here
go back and you see in this case it
didn't close out the browser completely
because otherwise it would have went to
my homepage which is google com in this
case it just reloaded phonebook calm so
this is kind of what you see on like
Windows Phone 7 where it just saves the
state and it resumes or restarts it when
you open the up the app against but
that's pretty much it hopefully that
gives you a better idea of how the
multitasking works alright that's it for
me this is David for MOFCOM thank you
for watching the video and don't forget
to visit bomble com for more cell phone
news reviews and how to's then
