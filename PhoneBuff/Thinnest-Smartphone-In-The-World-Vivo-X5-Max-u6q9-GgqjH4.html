have a very special unboxing for you
guys because in this video we're going
to be taking a look at the bebo x5 max
which is probably a brand on the phone
that you guys have never heard of before
and it's not a device this can be a top
contender in 2015 it's not a phone
that's going to win a lot of speed says
here in the channel but it is a brand
and it is a phone that has won in
something and something significant at
that and that is the title for the
world's thinnest smartphone now over the
last few weeks and months you guys have
probably heard about a phone called the
Oppo r5 but those on a tech plug are
here on YouTube with people claiming it
to be the thinnest smartphone in the
world at four point eight five
millimeters thick now this was true
technically for about a week before VEVO
came along and announced the x5 Maxx
claiming to be even thinner at four
point seven five millimeters thick so
not much of a difference between it to
just one tenth of a millimeter
but when it comes to winning the top
spot for the world's thinnest smartphone
doesn't matter if your dinner by 1/10 of
a millimeter or by an inch it don't
matter if you win by an inch or a mile
winnings winning being thinner is
thinner and that is what the x5 max is
and taking a look at the device itself
your first impression your second
impression and probably even your third
impression is almost guaranteed to be
Wow
this thing is freaking thin I mean I
feel like I could stay here all day and
tell you guys how thin I think this
thing is obviously a lot of its not
going to come through because you're
taking a look at it through video so I
am gonna be doing a side-by-side
comparison with some of the more popular
smartphones on the market just to kind
of give you a point of reference but
first things first let's go ahead and
finish up the unboxing actually a very
nicely presented box with a few boxes
inside of the box so this unboxing
doesn't go several layers deep and the
first thing we'll take a look at here is
presumably the documentation in
paperwork and Wow
actually what's interesting here is
there's a Kay
included with your typical documentation
so not sure why we will have done that I
don't know if it's because the device is
so thin in an easy case or if they're
just trying to add value to the user
experience but either way that's
actually pretty cool so moving on we'll
take a look at the USB wall adapter and
cable included and uh nothing special
here just your typical USB to microUSB
cable with your wall adapter so you can
charge the phone in that way because
I've seen that hundreds of times before
and outlasting inside of the box or
these headphones and actually something
I want to show you guys with these
headphones is the connection that it's
using on the back and that is a 3.5
millimeter connection now you may be
wondering why I'm making a point to even
talk about the headphone jack and the
fact that a 3.5 millimeter headphone and
up the reason why is because the Oppo r5
which was talking about earlier doesn't
actually have a headphone jack included
and a lot of people were speculating
that the reason why they thought it
wasn't included was because the device
was so freakin thin but obviously that
is not the case because not only has
people included a headphone jack they
did it any body that's even thinner so
that is actually pretty impressive in
taking a look at the headphone jack
actually this metal band that goes
around the sides which by the way feels
very very solid in the hand doesn't
actually fully encircle the headphone
jack it goes around maybe I don't know
70 or 80 percent with the remainder of
it being encircled by the back case so
it kind of goes to show you how much
they're pushing the boundaries in the
limits with this thing and I gotta tell
you guys I think it's impressive I mean
I know a lot of you guys would be
wondering you know why would somebody
need a phone so then why would somebody
even want a phone so thin and those are
valid questions to ask and concerns that
have but from my standpoint and from a
technology enthusiast standpoint and
from a phonebook standpoint you kind of
have to appreciate the technology and
the engineering that goes into making a
device this thin especially when you
consider the fact that the X by max
actually has relatively decent specs
it's got a 5.5 inch 1080p display as a 5
megapixel front facing camera as a 13
megapixel rear camera with a Sony sensor
underneath the hood you have a
Snapdragon 615 64-bit octa-core
processor with 2 gigabytes of RAM a 2000
milliamp battery of course it has a
headphone jack which obviously is hard
to put in here with the device this thin
and maybe most impressively you also
have a micro SD card slot for expandable
memory so it's impressive the fact that
they're able to fit so much into a
device so thin I gotta tip my hat off to
VEVO I think it's impressive now let's
get to that side-by-side comparison that
I promised you guys earlier so first
foam we'll compare it to is going to be
the HTC One m8 and I've taken a look at
these things side-by-side
I mean you can tell right off the bat
how much thinner the X 5 max is now keep
in mind the m8 does have a curved design
so it's thickest point actually isn't on
its size it's in the middle of the back
and maybe if you look at it this way you
can tell how much thinner the X 5 max is
it's it's impressive let's go ahead and
compare it to another device as compared
to one that has a similar size in the
galaxy note 4 Wow
the no.4 I never thought it was a thick
phone but compared to this thing it
looks pretty hefty here it looks like I
could stack 2 X 5 maxes on top of each
other to equal one note
now obviously I'm exaggerating a little
bit you guys could do the math on that
but it's thinner and it's significantly
thinner definitely noticeable and last
device wall compared to probably the
most relevant is the iPhone 6 plus this
phone was one of the thinner phones when
I was first announced and even this
compared to the x5 max
I mean there's just no comparison
doesn't come close the X bar max is just
so much thinner even with the rounded
edges at the
iPhone has it's a president you know one
thing I will say just by holding the
device for the little period that I've
been holding it despite the fact that I
has a large screen at 5.5 inches it
feels very very easy to hold and it also
feels very very light because of device
so thin and doesn't have the biggest
battery obviously but it's easy to hold
I actually like that and that's probably
one of the big advantages of having a
device so thin and again do you need a
smartphone this thin do you want a
smartphone this thin I don't know that
comes down to personal preference but
one thing I will say about having a
smartphone this then is it probably
opens the door for a manufacturer like
Bevo or Apple or anybody else to make a
device using similar internals but
instead of making it so thin making it
about as thick as let's say Ã¬no for
here so imagine a device the same
internals a stick is enough for with all
that extra thickness being used
specifically or solely for the batteries
so instead of having a three thousand
million battery maybe you keep it in a
four thousand million battery instead of
the iPhone having a two thousand million
battery maybe you have a three thousand
million battery and so on and so forth
maybe you could also fit in a larger
camera sensor I mean this one is
pre-shooting but maybe if you still have
a protruding one you get a bigger sensor
in there and finally have cameras that
have the quality closer to DSLRs I don't
know just a thought but anyways that is
it for me in this video if you guys like
this video if you guys like this content
you want to see more like it
make sure to give this video a big
thumbs up to show you love subscribe to
the channel for more videos just like
this actually I have a bunch of videos
planned that you guys will not want to
miss and up as always thank you guys for
