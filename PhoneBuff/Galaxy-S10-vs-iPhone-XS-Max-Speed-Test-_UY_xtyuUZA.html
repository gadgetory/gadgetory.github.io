a while since we've done a speed test
here on the channel but with the s10
finally coming in smartphone season has
officially begun and what better way to
kick things off then the matchup that we
have here today where the sm+ will go
head-to-head against the reigning
sweet-ass champ in the iPhone 10s max
taking a look at the spec sheets the
iPhone of course is powered by the a12
Bionic chip paired with four gigabytes
ram the s10 plus on the other hand comes
with double that at 8 gigabytes of RAM
which is actually standard and for this
test we're using the snapdragon 855
variant of the s10 which looks to be a
solid upgrade over last year's chipsets
now in addition to the new hardware
samsung says that the s10 also uses AI
to learn how you use your phone in order
to be able to launch your most
frequently used apps a little bit faster
and in order to test this we made sure
to not just run our test once like we
never really do that we always run
multiple trials but this time we ran
multiple trials across multiple days to
give the software more than enough time
to learn which apps we're using so that
way we can actually see if it makes a
difference of course to keep things nice
and fair we did the same exact thing
with the iPhone so I'm excited to see
what happens will the s10 earn the title
of speed test champ for Samsung for the
first time since the galaxy note 5 or
will the iPhone continue it's win streak
and it go undefeated let's find out
after the test be sure to check out the
official speed test rankings on our
websites which we created easily using
Wix the sponsor for today's episode with
Wix you can tap into the power of your
smart phone by building your own website
using artificial design intelligence
just to answer a few questions upload
some of your photos and pick a theme
that best matches your style and then
have AI do the rest building you a
professional website that looks great on
mobile and on desktop click them that
special link down below to start your
own website for free all right we'll
kick things off by starting the
stopwatch is on each phone and then
jumping into the first row where the sm+
just blows through Facebook to get the
early lead but with the iPhone being
able to quickly recover just one app
later in Starbucks putting the phone's
neck and neck as they began working on
word with the iPhone loading that 500
page documents add a significantly
faster rate allowing it to pull ahead as
it races through Excel and moves on to
the second row the s10 is still right
there behind it as it finishes up with
Excel joining the iPhone in the second
row with it snapping a selfie and then
working on editing that selfie with the
same exact filter here in snap see it
seems like the SN plus is taking a bit
longer to export that edited selfie
along the iPhone to pull even further
ahead as it just rips through premier
we'll see if the s10 can match it and
know the s10 also seems to be exporting
the video clip and premiere at a slower
rates along the iPhone to capture its
biggest lead of the test so far pulling
a full lap ahead as it finishes up with
subway surfers and begins working on
flip diving so it'll be interesting to
see if the snaps are getting a 55 under
the hood of the s10 can make a
difference here in the game's row or if
the s10 is being bottlenecked by it's
slower ufs 2.1 storage which
unfortunately sampson decided to stick
with even though it's using faster ufs
3.0 in its upcoming galaxy fold
either way the s10 did load subway
surfers at a slower rates while managing
to slightly outpaced the iPhone while
loading Club diving with the iPhone
finishing up with bullet force it moves
on to the last row where historically
many Android phones have actually had
the
Vantage and with iPhone just stuttering
here in ESPN it opens the door for the
s10 to possibly make a comeback as the
iPhone moves on to Netflix the s10 joins
it in the last row with it flying
through Spotify and loading ESPN
significantly faster as well cutting
down on the iPhones lead but not before
the iPhone finishes the first stop with
the time of 1 minute and 50 seconds with
the s 10 quickly closing in finishing
the first time just four seconds later
so an incredible turnaround from the S
10 there in the last row but it may have
been too little too late with the S 10s
only chance I'm making a comeback here
in the second row requiring the iPhone
to stumble in one of these apps and so
far that doesn't look like it's going to
happen with the iPhone snapping that
second selfie and wait the iPhone fails
to keep Excel open can the S 10 keep it
open and yes it does allowing it to pull
ahead late here in the second lap
keeping both Starbucks and Facebook open
finishing the test first with a total
time of two minutes and 25 seconds with
the iPhone seeming to have taken a step
backwards since our last test in terms
of RAM management with it also failing
to keep Microsoft Word Starbucks and now
Facebook open finishing the test 16
seconds later with a total time of 2
minutes and 41 seconds making the winner
and new font of style speeds has champ
the galaxy s 10 plus for the updated
speed test rankings be sure to check out
our website linked below which we
created easily with our sponsor wix's
drag and drop editor anyways that is it
for me in this video thank you guys for
watching and as always I'll see you in
the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
