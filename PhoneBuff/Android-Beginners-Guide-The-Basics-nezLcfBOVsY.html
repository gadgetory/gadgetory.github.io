bumble calm and today we're doing an
introduction video to android so this
videos really meant for people who are
new to android and it's just a very very
basic guide on how to navigate
throughout the android OS so with that
said it's go ahead and jump right into
it so one of the first things you're
going to need to know how to do is how
to lock and unlock your phone screen and
the way you do that is you're going to
press the power key either located at
the top or the side of your device but
regardless of where it is when you tap
the button it's going to turn the screen
off and this prevents you from
pocket-dialing and also prevents you
from wasting battery life when you're
not using the phone when you tap the
button again it brings the screen right
back on to what is called the lock
screen now this screen doesn't let you
do anything I mean pretty much it's a
lock screen so to unlock it you're gonna
have to do some kind of swiping gestures
either it's swiping up or to the side or
some kind of combination of those
depending on your phone this case you
just swipe up and it takes you to what
is called the home screen the home
screen on Android is very similar to the
way the desktop is on a Windows computer
basically it's a space where you can put
your application shortcuts you can move
them around from place to place or even
screen the screen in this case and when
you drop it you've rearranged your home
screen this phone has seven different
home screens as you can see some phones
only come with three or somewhere in
between really depends on your phone
model but that's pretty much how your
home screen works so if this is your
home screen or desktop on a computer
then the application launcher which is
at the very bottom left or the bottom
right or on the center but if the icon
looks usually like that right here it
would be your all programs list so I'm
gonna go ahead and tap this guy and you
can see it gives me my full list of
applications that I could scroll through
and if I wanted to add a shortcut to my
home screen I could press and hold on it
and you can see I just drop it right
there on my home screen so I can easier
access it later on and if you ever
change your mind on having the shortcut
on your home screen you could easily
delete it by pressing holding on it and
dragging it to the very
bottom where it says remove letting go
and it's gone and you don't have to
worry about it deleting from phone
itself because it's still there I'm just
deleting the strokin itself you want to
actually remove the app from your phone
you'd have to uninstall it and there's a
tutorial on how to do that on form of
comp so the next thing you need to know
about is your notification bar this is
the bar at the very top of your phone
and this is where you can see your time
your battery life your signal strength
your wireless connections that are on
but most importantly the notifications
and the notification will show up here
it can be anything from voicemails text
messages to emails to updates or
anything like that
basically any notification will show up
right here to access it you tap it at
the very top and scroll down you can see
it brings down the window and it says I
have a new voicemail so if I tap that
guy it'll go straight to my voicemail
app so I can listen to it I get a text
same thing and go to the text messaging
app email update whatever it is it'll
take you to the place you need to go so
to close it you can either drag this guy
up or just hit the HOME key and you're
taking right back to your home screen so
one of the most important things that
you need to know about is the Menu key
and the Menu key is this guy at the very
bottom on your phone you can see it
looks like that might look a little bit
different your phone but for the most
part that's what it looks like and
pressing it brings up you menu options
now the menu options change from screen
to screen depending on what you're
looking at in this case you can see it
gives me options for notifications main
settings personalized ringtones and
wallpaper because I want my homescreen
if I go to my messages and press menu
you can see it gives me different
options like delete compose group
message settings drafts so whatever you
wonder you're looking at if you want
more options tap the Menu key and if you
don't find the thing you're looking for
within those menu options you might want
to try something else which is called
long press so on Android long press is
the equivalent of right-clicking on a
Windows computer and the way you do it
is pretty much just tap and hold on
anywhere on the screen and you can see
it gives me a different set of options
so this is a personalized tab for HTC
but let's go to messages and I'll click
on this messaging and I'll press and
hold on it and you see it gives me a
window that says view delete reply
forward and
things of that nature it again it
changes with every application you're on
so if I go to calendar and I long press
on something you can see this gives me
the option for a new event so changes
from screen to screen but again if
you're looking for another option that
currently isn't available try that so
now that you know the basic ways to
navigate throughout the phone you're
going to need to know how to go to your
main phone's settings and the way you do
let's go to your home screen which is
right here
um you just tap home and I'll take it to
your home screen and homes a little icon
you see right over here typically a
little shape of a house anyway you press
it and press the Menu key and go to the
settings right here and you can see it
gives you the options for your wireless
networks which is where your Bluetooth
and Wi-Fi is you go to sound settings
for your ringtones and volumes display
settings for how bright the screen is
and things of that nature
when pretty much any control you're
looking for not that are not related to
applications specifically or right here
so those are the basics to navigating
throughout the Android OS but I want to
show you how to download an app because
this is one of the funnest features with
your Android phone so you can see the
market app right here is the place where
you can download all your applications
it looks just like that I'm going to go
ahead and tap on it and you can see it
takes you to this screen and this is the
main market screen from here you can
choose to browse through applications
through music books and movies just
going to tap apps and I'll go ahead and
download an application so you can swipe
left and right you see it says featured
top paid and top free one of the best
parts about Android is two thirds of the
applications on the market are free I'm
gonna go ahead and download something
quick and easy will do Netflix so it's
going to hit download right here at the
very top right you may accept and
download again and you can see it's
downloading the application I could
actually hit home and let it download in
the background you can see in the
notification bar up here it has a little
download icon and you can see it's
downloading and installing Netflix as
soon as it's done I could tap it and
it'll take me straight to the
application alright so it's done I'll
tap the guy you can see it takes me
straight to the Netflix application so
home and I automatically add yourself
into your main application list but it
doesn't add it to the home screen so if
you want to add it to your home screen
you can do the same thing press and hold
drop it on your home screen and there
you go but that's pretty much it I mean
I feel like that's enough for you to be
able to navigate throughout the Android
OS of course it does take time to learn
how to use it give yourself a week or
two but guarantee that you'll fall in
love with it after a while this is David
