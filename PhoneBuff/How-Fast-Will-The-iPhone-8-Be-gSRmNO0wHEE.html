of clans so Viking fields at the top
strategy game from the 90s and 2000's
but finally on mobile and in 3d while
there are hundreds of strategy games to
the App Store Vikings is on a different
level it's one of the more addicting
games that I played recently just play
for five minutes and you'll see why it's
famous for its massive online battles
between clans and even countries with
over 3 million players attending these
events so click on the links down below

gold for a fast and successful start
what's up guys David here and the iPhone
8 is just around the corner like nobody
knows exactly when it's going to come
out maybe it'll be in September maybe
there will be some sort of delay the
rumor mill is still undecided but one
thing that almost all the rumors and
leaks are pointing to is that the iPhone
8 whenever it comes out is going to be
packing some serious power under the
hood thanks to the all new a 11 chip
from Apple's but until the iPhone 8
officially gets released there's no way
of knowing exactly how much performance
it will actually bring to the table how
it'll perform in the real world but that
doesn't mean that we can't get a little
sneak peek to give us a rough idea you
see last year before the iPhone 7 came
out we did a speed test between the
iPhone 6s which was powered by the Apple
a9 and the iPad pro which was powered by
the beefed up a 9 X and it turned out
that the beefed up iPad pros performance
was pretty damn close to how the iPhone
7 ended up performing in our test I mean
it wasn't like the perfect comparison a
perfect match but definitely in the
ballpark so today we're gonna be doing
this same exact thing but this time
around we'll be testing the a10 fusion
in the iPhone 7 against the all new iPad
pro which is using the beefed up a 10x
which not only has an additional fusion
core three cores instead of two but it's
also manufactured using the new 10
nanometer process so definitely a more
powerful chip and until the iPhone 8
officially drops it'll be the most
powerful chip you can get on any iOS
device so with that said let's get to
the speed test and see if we can get a
little sneak peek to how the iPhone 8
will end up performing all right we'll
get things going by starting the
stopwatch is
on each device where on your left you
have the iPad pro with the new six core
a 10x chip and on your right you have
the iPhone 7 with a regular quad core a
10 fusion now going into Facebook iPhone
7 gets to step over the iPad which
probably had to do a little bit with the
iPad having to load more content due to
its bigger screen but after loading up
Photoshop mix at a faster rate than the
iPhone the iPad is right back into it
where it'll be interesting to see how
much of a difference there is here in
lapses where wow the iPad pro and the a
10x is just ripping through the
time-lapse
completely smoking the iPhone 7 and
already moving on to the gaming realm
and there you go guy from 7 finishes up
with the time-lapse that would seem to
be a snail's pace even though it's
faster than almost any other smartphone
out there so promising results right
there from the a 10x of course what may
be more applicable to the performance we
can expect from the iPhone 8 is how the
iPad pro does here in the gaming row
where so far it's loaded every game at a
faster rate than the iPhone 7 will have
a lot of times from this first lap by
the end of the video so stick around for
that but for now the iPad pro finishes
up with the gaming row and pulls a full
app ahead of the iPhone 7 after loading
every game including bullet force at a
faster rate so impressive results so far
especially when he considered that in
all likelihood the iPhone 8 and the new
811 chip will offer even better
performance okay here we go the iPad pro
finishes the first lap with a time of 1
minute and 24 seconds with the iPhones
I've been working on that last leg of
the first lap loading up the Apple
website where it finishes the first lap
a cold 10 seconds later with the time of
1 minute and 34 seconds so I know 10
seconds doesn't seem like all that big
of a difference but when you consider
that the difference between the iPhone 7
and iPhone 6s was only 12 seconds 10
seconds is a pretty big deal and there's
a good chance that the iPhone 8 will
only improve on that number which is
saying a lot considering that the iPhone
7 is already one of the fastest
smartphones in the world and that's
before iOS 11 brings improvements to
animation speed so I am excited for the
iPhone 8 of course this video isn't
official by any means is just
speculation based off of past trends but
there you go the iPhone 7 finishes at
10 seconds later so the entire
difference was in that first lap where
the processors were put to the test
which just may be a sign of what's
coming with the iPhone 8 anyways that is
it for me in this video be sure to
subscribe for the official speed test
when the iPhone 8 launches thank you
guys for watching and as always I'll see
you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
