claimed that they were using the
strongest class to ever be used in a
smartphone and this year with iPhone 10s
and the 10s max they're doubling down on
that claim saying this year's new
iPhones or even more durable than lasts
so today we're going to be putting that
claim to the test comparing the iPhone
10's max to easily its biggest
competitor in the galaxy note 9 to see
which one of these thousands or our
flagships is actually more durable let's
get right into it round number one
backdrop in three two one
so after that backdrop both phones have
their rear glass cracked but there is a
pretty big difference in the total
amount of damage that each phone took
the iPhone 10's max suffered a few
cracks at the bottom with a single crack
going up across the back while the note
9s glass on the other hand just
completely shattered all the way across
I'm not sure if the difference here is
because the iPhone actually has stronger
glass like Apple claims or had to do
more with the iPhones protruding camera
lens helping it break the fall which is
definitely a possibility given the scuff
marks we see here on the camera housing
itself but either way the total amount
of damage on the iPhone was less than on
the notes giving it the win in round
number one round number two corner drop
in three two one
so neither phone suffered too much
damage after that corner drop the
screens on both phones are still fully
intact and the only real damage is a few
scuff marks on each of the phone's
frames the aluminum frame on the note 9
does make the scuff marks look a little
bit more visible to the camera under
direct light here but in most other
lighting conditions the scuff marks on
the iPhones stainless steel band look
equally as bad making it a tie here in
round number two round number three bass
drop three to one
after that face drop both bones
unfortunately have their screens cracked
but just like with the backdrop the
iPhone did manage to do a better job at
keeping the damage contained with the
majority of the cracks being limited to
the bottom of the phone whereas on the
note 9 the cracks just spiderwebbed
all across the display so it looks like
the iPhone 10's s glass is actually
stronger after all giving it the wane
here in round number 3 bonus round okay
so both phones still remain fully
functional after our 10 point inspection
meaning each phone will move on to the
bonus round where it'll be dropped up to
10 times from just under 5 feet last
times the no 9 was able to survive not
one that's 5 but all 10 bonus drops
technically remaining fully functional
despite its severely shattered glass
let's see if the iPhone 10s Maxx can do
any better
bonus shop in three two one so that was
really loud does the phone still work
ooh
so this screen does seem to be working
that's good news but the shattering just
got wow that's quite a bit so before we
had that like relatively light crack at
the bottom and over here but now we have
full-blown shattering bonus drop two and
three two one three two one
how much damage can one phone take how
much abuse oh okay
the screen is off was like okay but the
phone does seem to be working with speed
like all four corners work camera let's
do the mail app is it working here
hmm well that's interesting whoa whoa
look at that so that works right the TV
app and then it looks like up here it
can't touch can't touch right there nope
whew the very top left works okay so I'm
assuming these will work so the second
and third rows unresponsiveness eyes
you'll see a 3d touch works on them nope
though that's a interesting result can
we dial nine-one-one can we do make an
emergency call yes
no no Wow okay so after just three bonus
drops we had to throw in the towel dye
phone's display just wouldn't respond
anywhere in the area between the second
and the third rows on the home screen
pretty much making the phone unusable
there's also some damage to the display
itself underneath the glass so all in
all just not a very good result here for
the iPhone in the bonus round alright so
with all four rounds in the books let's
take a look at the score card in the
first round
the iPhones rear glass sustained
significantly less damage from the
backdrop in the second both walls
performed roughly the same while in the
third the iPhone tennis max showed us
that it's glass actually is stronger and
then finally in the fourth round the no
nines superior impact and shock
resistance a lot of to wipe away the
iPhones lead from the other rounds
ultimately giving it the win here in
this drop text anyways that is it for me
in this video thank you guys for
watching and as always I'll see you in
the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
