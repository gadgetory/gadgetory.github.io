calm and in this video we're doing a
comparison between the screens on the
Samsung Galaxy Nexus and the Samsung
Galaxy s3 so both of these screens are
actually Super AMOLED you know the both
manufactured by Samsung so you think
they're very close differences the
Galaxy Nexus has a four point six five
inch screen versus the 4.8 inch screen
on the samsung galaxy s3
obviously that gives the Galaxy Nexus
considering they're both HD screens a
higher pixels per inch which is 316 PPI
compared to just 306 because this one
has to cover you know a larger area so
anyways you would expect the screen on
the Galaxy Nexus to be a little bit
better but Samson said you know because
they are using that pentile display
layout they actually made the pixels a
little bit closer together to one
another on the extension galaxy s3
screen to make the quality better so
pretty confusing they really choose I
mean look at the spreadsheet you would
think the Galaxy Nexus screens will be
better if you listen to Samsung you
would think that the galaxy s3 screen is
gonna be better so I don't know which
one's better for real I don't know who
to listen to or what to listen to what
will go ahead and test it and see if we
can even see a difference so I'll go
ahead and hit play on these two videos
and do a few other tests though so I try
to get them at the same time but
obviously I feel like that but hopefully
this gives you a good enough idea as far
as the difference both screens are
turned up to maximum brightness so keep
that you know in mind so far I mean they
both look a little bit or if they both
look pretty similar I feel like the
Samsung Galaxy s3 screens may be a
little bit brighter compared to the
Galaxy Nexus just a little bit but other
than that they look pretty much the same
I mean can't really tell the difference
alright so this video ended we'll go
ahead and close out of here and got the
same background loaded for both so let's
look at the application shortcuts first
on the galaxy s3 so pays into this top
row because they're the same on both
phones so we'll go ahead and look at you
know Google Earth nice and close and
then Google
plus the Play Store and then YouTube and
let's do the same thing on the Galaxy
Nexus so we'll look at Google Earth
Google Plus YouTube and the Play Store
so uh let's try simply get them close
together I'll actually move earth to the
right side of the screen and up here so
that way you get you know the earth logo
up and close so on the left is the
galaxy s3 on the right is the Galaxy
Nexus I'm not sure if there's much of
difference I mean it's really hard to
see on camera
looks like the galaxy s3 screen on the
left looks a little bit smoother than
the Gulf's next on the right but I don't
it could use my viewfinder you guys can
be the judge of that should I get closer
if I can I'll hold them both exactly
levels that were there equal distance
apart are away from the screen so anyway
that's as close like a pretty much get I
mean you really have to put it under the
microscope I think to get a big
difference we'll go ahead and I don't
know let's go to on the web and just
look at you know this is a Chrome
browser cuz they're both the same so
Chrome browser on here let's open this
guy up and go to phonebook calm really
quick so we got foam buff loaded on both
websites let's go ahead and look at how
they look so this like I don't know I
feel like I get again the galaxy s3
screens a little brighter I'm not sure
if it's coming through on camera but in
person when I'm looking at them the
Galaxy Nexus screen is is a little bit
darker and you know like I said I did
put these guys both on a full brightness
cuz got a force close error but anyway
let's go ahead and not consumed out all
the way on both phones and then look at
this little review section so we'll look
at the review section right here on the
galaxy s3 so keep in mind that you know
part of the blurriness are most of the
building this is going to be due to my
camcorder not necessarily the screen but
anyway you could pretty much read what
it says where there says Adam a colonel
on t-mobile as she has three let's go
ahead and try the same thing on the
Galaxy Nexus and it says again Adam a
colonel I feel like this time is
actually a little clearer
on the Galaxy Nexus and that's probably
due to the higher ppi so overall I mean
they're pretty much the same the
difference is I feel like the galaxy s3
maybe is a little bit brighter I don't
know if I'm just imagining that but I
really feel like that and you know I've
asked a couple of people this looks a
little bit more like brown on the art of
the white background has more of a hint
of brown maybe compared to the galaxy s3
on the Galaxy Nexus so anyway that's
that but if you look at the screens up
close maybe the you know I feel like the
Galaxy Nexus the screen is a little bit
sharper because of the higher possess
branch but anyway that's it from me this
video I just wanted to make it for those
of you guys you know wondering between
these two phones honestly both of these
screens are pretty amazing I love out
both of them
they're both HD can't really ask for
more you know watching YouTube when
these guys are absolutely awesome but
just wanted to make a quick comparison
