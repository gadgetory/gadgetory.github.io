calm and in this video we're doing a
review on Android 4.2 jelly bean on the
Nexus 4 over here so basically I'm just
gonna be taking a look at what's new
with 4.2 so first thing we'll start off
with is the lockscreen which now has
widgets on it so for example if I wanted
my camera app I would just swipe over to
the right like that and boom my camera
launches now that might not really
excite you all that much considering
that before you have the option to
unlock to the left that basically opened
the camera anyways so what will expect
you though is the fact that I have my
messaging widget right over here I have
my song identifier widget and I have my
calendar widget and if I wanted to add
more widgets I just swipe over to the
left one more time hit this plus sign
you can see the widgets I could actually
choose from and I only imagine this will
grow over time so I'll go ahead and exit
out of here
next thing you'll notice right away is
the time which are the clock widget
should I say so this is actually new and
it comes pre-installed it's not
third-party one so you can see that UI
actually looks different for the alarm
app or the clock app and not only that
you have the world clock capability now
which is pretty cool and for the first
time now we have built-in timers and
stop watches which before you always
have to get from a third party so pretty
cool to see that Google incorporated
that and I imagine that will incorporate
with Google now in the future so we'll
go ahead and take a look at the next
feature which is gonna be the keyboard
so we'll tap on this note right here so
for example if I wanted to type you know
I have the same great keyboard from
Android 4.1 I mean it has a text
prediction offline dictation all that
good stuff but now you have gesture
sliding or gesture typing so basically
it kind of works like swipe so for
example if I want to write the quick
brown fox so it worked like that now
notice that when I actually go over the
words it actually gives me a preview of
what it thinks I'm gonna type so right
now is BRR go over to here and think
this bro go here and brow and then
finally Brown so what I found is it's
actually more accurate for me at least
because it gives me the previews because
it gives me a better idea as far as what
I'm actually doing so that's a pretty
cool feature right here another thing is
what it came built-in I'm not sure
is something you could download right
now but I can't built-in with a emoji
keyboard which is called iw and an emoji
IME so I go to choose input method C
emoji input right here and basically I
have a whole bunch of emojis that could
actually choose from I could press this
down and go faces and Smiley's artifacts
activities etc so that's a pretty cool
little feature as well we'll go ahead
and back out of here and look at the
notification shade so what's different
with the notification shade now is that
you have quick settings instead of just
a shortcut to the settings so when you
type this guy gonna give you most
commonly used shortcuts right over here
so I have my brightness I've you know my
carrier my battery airplane mode
Bluetooth Wi-Fi etc and what I've
noticed actually changes at least this
little bottom-right icon for example
right now have an alarm set it shows up
when if I if I were to turn off that
alarm this would actually disappear so
that's a pretty cool little feature
while we're here Maz will go into the
settings and take a look at the easter
egg
so Android 4.2 jelly bean so yeah I mean
we'll go ahead and press this - I know
some of you guys want to see that so
we'll go ahead and back out of here and
go on to the next feature which is
actually why I want to show you the the
new animations when I multitask so for
example when I press this button over
here it kind of like jumps down into the
most testing window which is pretty cool
and also since I opened in chrome and
might as well mention that it's actually
now default you know before on 4.1 they
had another browser and chrome was
basically a third-party our not there
but you'd have to download it from the
Play Store now it doesn't come with any
browser but Chrome so actually you know
comes pre-installed which is pretty cool
next feature is the daydream or the
screensaver so basically I'll go to
display and show you that really quick
so see if they call it daydream
basically it's kind of like a
screensaver so when you dock your phone
or when you plug it in you could
actually set it to have this if you want
you get out of your clock beeping your
colors currents photo frame photo table
whatever I actually like the bean
flinger which basically when you plug it
in this is what shows up pretty cool
little touch I mean not necessarily
something's gonna change to your
experience but just a nice touch we'll
go ahead and back out of here while
we're here will show you that it does
have
wireless display options now so
basically it's using a technology called
miracast
and it's made by the are supported by
the Wi-Fi Alliance not a lot of devices
out there have it basically what it does
when you turn it on it'll allow you to
mirror what's on your phone on to like a
big screen or a blu-ray player or
whatever it is and it's kind of like
Apple's AirPlay but like I said it's a
technology that's pretty new right now
so it might grow in the future and if it
does that'd be great
go on to the next one which is gonna be
the security features we're actually now
when you download an app it'll verify
the app so we'll go to security and you
can see says verify apps so you could
check it our uncheck it and basically
it'll warn you before installing an app
that may cause harm to your phone which
is definitely a plus
definitely gotta like that go on to the
next one which is gonna be the where is
it
Oh magnifique magnification options so
if I go to accessibility there it is
having trouble finding it you can
actually turn on the magnification
gestures which basically allows you if
you're to triple tap on something like
that it'll zoom in so that's pretty cool
to do also if you triple tap and hold
it'll zoom in temporarily and then you
let go it'll zoom out so it's cool but
I'm mostly if I left it on it kind of
makes it lag a little as far as you know
your button presses which I don't like I
mean obviously if you need the zooming
ability it's worth it but for me I turn
it off so we'll go ahead and turn off
right now because I don't want it to
make me lag when I press button so
anyway that is that what else is new is
Google now so basically what Google now
does now is it will check your emails
for flight information for shipment
tracking for hotel reservations and
basically it'll populate in your cards
you know in addition to all the great
things that it does already so that's a
cool little feature and what else am I
missing one of the more major new
features is the camera app on Android
4.2 so not only does it actually look
different actually works a little
differently too
so for example if I wanted to get to my
camera settings instead of having to
reach over you know to the edges of the
screen which is kind of hard to do with
these bigger screens I could just tap
anywhere in the screen and hold and
basically I have all my office of
example my are my exposure right here
facing camera right here worth
mentioning - is now the camera app
actually has HDR built-in I know that
you know that's been available for a
long time on third-party you eyes but
hasn't been so on stock Android now it
is if I want to change my flash settings
are here want to go to my settings can
do it right there so pretty cool while
we're here might as well look at the
next new feature which is the
photosphere mode so if I tap this camera
but I could do no regular shot video
panorama or photosphere now when you tap
on photosphere basically what you can do
is make like a Google Streetview 360
picture so it's not just like panoramas
it's more than that so for example you
can see it's almost like on a little
virtual reality type screen right now
and moving around now it's kind of hard
to do because I don't really have a lot
of space to work with but we'll go ahead
and take a look at one I did on a soccer
field so we'll go ahead and tap on this
really quick and you can see I did a 360
view of the soccer field that night you
can see it's not necessarily completely
100% accurate I mean it did kind of miss
on these lines a little bit maybe I was
moving around too much with the camera I
try to stay still though but nonetheless
I mean this is awesome it took me a
while to do this I mean it takes a bunch
of pictures to do this but a full 360
look at you know where you are so I can
imagine this could be really useful I
mean not only is it cool but I'm sure a
lot of people and a lot of business
professionals could use this one example
could be like a real estate professional
you want to you know take a picture of a
house well no better way to do it than
this so that's pretty cool well go ahead
and back out here and also show you
another thing within the camera or more
specifically the camera you know or the
gallery is the photo editing options so
now it's kind of more like Instagram and
you have a whole bunch of different
filters you can apply so I'm sure a lot
of the instagramers out there gonna love
that you can add borders and whatnot to
your pictures so that's pretty cool and
then you still have the same option as
far as what you had with ICS and 4.1
which is you know ability to crop
straight in do a mirror so basically you
can flip it over like that
and change the exposure settings all
that good stuff so that's another cool
option with Android 4.2 and definitely
you know a welcomed new addition to and
already you know future packed OS
another thing I noticed when
playing around with the settings was the
cell broadcast so if we go under more I
have a new option for cell broadcasts
basically it'll alert you for
emergencies so you can actually check
them or uncheck if you want like Amber
Alerts severe threats extreme threats
etc so pretty cool to have that oh via
app drawer now shows more icons so if
you were to take a look at the Galaxy
Nexus running for point one you can see
now we have more content displayed which
is awesome and you have high resolution
displays you have big displays might as
well show more icons at once so it you
know basically reduces the amount of
scrolling you have to do from page to
page so that's definitely a nice touch
but that's pretty much it I'm hopefully
I don't miss anything I'm sure I am if
you guys have any questions on it just
leave a comment down below overall I
have to say I definitely liked the
update you know it's definitely one
that's welcomed it's not necessarily you
know a huge update it's just I mean
that's why they kept the name jelly bean
it's just incremental one but definitely
one that is much appreciated and yep
that's pretty much it for me in this
video you guys found it helpful if you
liked it please hit the thumbs up button

bunch more coverage on not only the
Nexus 4 but Android 4.2 jelly bean -
