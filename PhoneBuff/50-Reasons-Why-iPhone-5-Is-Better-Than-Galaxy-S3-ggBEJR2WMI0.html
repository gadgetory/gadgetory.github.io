whoa whoa calm and last time we did a
video like this we looked at why the
galaxy s3 was better than the iPhone 5
but today is the iPhone 5s time to shine
so we're gonna be looking at not just 10
not even 20 but 50 reasons why the
iPhone 5 is better than the galaxy s3
now of course not every reasons gonna be
that must-have killer feature for you
but that's what we're doing 50 reasons
because I'm positive that you can find
more than a few that you're gonna really
like and with that said let's go ahead
and get right into it
reason number one while the iPhone 5
screen is undoubtedly smaller than the
galaxy s3s
it offers you more pixels per inch or
PPI in other words with its 326 PPI
which is 20 more than the galaxy has to
reach 306 inch 4 inch die from fire
screen is actually sharper not just that
from our experience with the two devices
we found that the iPhone 5 screen is
brighter as well to adjust seven point
six millimeters thick the iPhone 5 is
nearly one millimeters thinner than the
galaxy s3 it may not seem like a lot but
is a difference of over 10% 3.15 is also
15% lighter than the galaxy s3 weighing
in at just 112 grams for thanks to it
being smaller thinner and lighter the
iPhone 5 is better for one-handed use
you can easily reach all four corners of
the screen whereas on the s3 the
opposite corner of your thumb can be
just out of reach reason number five
while there isn't anything wrong with
the s3 is polycarbonate material the all
glass and aluminum build on the iPhone 5
just looks and feels more high-end 6
unlike the galaxy s3 the iPhone 5 gets
updated to the latest version of its OS
soon after it becomes available
whereas on the s3 you have to wait for a
couple months until Samsung releases it
7 and because it gets updated faster and
for longer than the s3 the iPhone 5 is
gonna have more longevity 8 the App
Store many major app developers make iOS
their priority over Android and because
of this the iPhone 5 has more apps
available to it many of which are
exclusive to the iPhone 9 and oftentimes
when an app is available on both the
iPhone 5 and the galaxy
three the iPhone files version of it is
better like the u-verse app in this
example offering the remote control
feature exclusively on the iPhone reason
number 10 evidenced by the drop test
that we've done on both the iPhone 5 and
the galaxy s3 the iPhone 5 is the most
durable out of the two and considering
that these phones each cost over $500
retail this is an advantage for the
iPhone 5 that just had to be mentioned
11 with this new Lightning charging port
the iPhone 5 is easier to put on charge
compared to the s3 this is because
unlike the s3 the charging adapter can
be plugged in either way making it more
convenient when you're plugging it in
before going to bed at night 12
unlike the galaxy s3 the iPhone 5 has a
dedicated vibrate switch letting you put
your phone on vibrate with just the flip
13 the iPhone 5 speaker is louder than
the galaxy s3s
14 with its a6 dual-core processor and
with iOS 6 speed optimizations the
iPhone 5 is faster at booting up opening
applications and loading up webpages
reason number 15 while the galaxy s3 has
s voice it just doesn't stack up against
Siri in terms of speed accuracy and its
overall capabilities make your
reservation for two at Riptide tonight
at 8 o'clock
16
speaking of voice assistance on the
iPhone 5 you can talk to Siri just by
raising the phone to your head what's
the best phone in the world 17 on the
iPhone 5
you have the reader option which filters
out all the ads and menus from websites
letting you see just the content that
you want to while also giving you the
option to resize the text if needed 18
on the iPhone 5 sending a large video
via
is easy the phone will compress the
video and if it's still too large of a
file it will show you exactly how long
of a clip you can have and lets you trim
it right then and there on the Samsung
Galaxy s3 you just get a message saying
that the file is too large to attach and
are pretty much left to your own devices
nineteen iTunes while the Google Play
Store has vastly improved over the years
iTunes still has a larger collection of
media available and it often gets
content that's exclusive to it reason
number 20 on the iPhone 5 you can use
the Find My iPhone app to help you find
your phone in case you lose it and even
remotely wipe it in case you think it's
stolen this can be accessed from another
iOS device whether it's an iPhone or an
iPad or on your computer
hi cloud comm 21 while it ultimately
comes down to opinion the majority of
people would agree that the iPhone 5s
user interface is a bit more intuitive
than the galaxy s3s
just one example of this is the ease
with which you can uninstall an app from
the phone 22 thanks to its powerful
Apple a6 processor the iPhone 5 has
better 3d graphics capabilities compared
to the Samsung Galaxy s3 23 and speaking
of graphics the gaming experience on the
iPhone 5 is enhanced by the game center
which keeps track of the games you're
playing and even lets you challenge your
friends to beat your high scores 24
unlike with the galaxy s3 you can get
support for your iPhone 5 from people
who are trained specifically for it our
nearest Apple store out of the almost
400 locations worldwide
all right we're halfway there reason
number 25 the sixth generation iPhone is
better than the galaxy s3 is that unlike
the s3 the iPhone 5 doesn't have any
pre-installed carrier or manufacturer
apps often referred to as bloatware 26
the iPhone 5 has a built-in emoji
keyboard with dozens of emoticons choose
from which worked now only with the
messaging app but with some of the other
apps on iOS as well
27 while neither the iPhone 5 or the
galaxy s3 have dedicated camera buttons
the iPhone lets you capture a photo with
a volume button which at least gives you
a physical button to press 28 on the
iPhone 5 scrolling to the top of any app
is easy whether you're in the browser or
you're looking for a game on the App
Store all you have to do is just tap the
top of the screen and the iPhone will
automatically jump to the beginning of
the list 29
unlike on the Galaxy s3 the iPhone 5
gives you the option to choose how you
want your notifications you can choose
to either have none whatsoever
a banner that shows up on the top of the
screen or a pop-up alert that's sure to
grab your attention reason number 30
while the galaxy s3 used to have
Universal Search it is now only
available on the iPhone and therefore
it's a 30th reason why the iPhone 5 is
better than the galaxy s3 31 you can set
it so that the iPhone 5 reads aloud any
text you highlight whether it's in the
browser or any other app like notes in
this example the iPhone 5 owns the
galaxy s3
if you agree share this video 32 guided
access on the iPhone 5 you can enable a
feature called guided access which
prevents you or a little kid using your
phone from being able to get out of the
app even when pressing the physical
buttons on the phone 33 privacy options
on the iPhone 5 you can easily see which
apps have requested access to what and
also you have the option to limit ad
tracking while using your phone 34 the
iPhone 5 has do not disturb mode which
prevents any notifications or feedback
even the screen from turning on when
enabled what's better
you can even preset when you want it to
go into this mode such as when you are
usually sleeping reason number 35 on the
iPhone 5 you can set restrictions that
block certain applications or functions
for example you can prevent the Safari
browser from even showing up or you
could block the ability to uninstall
apps which is great for when you're
letting someone borrow your phone and
don't really want them messing with
anything
36 keyboard shortcuts on the iPhone 5
you can add your own personal keyboard
shortcuts for the phrases you most
commonly use for example I enter tbh
here which stands for to be honest this
way whenever I type tbh on the keyboard
it'll automatically spell out the whole
phrase for me 37 while the Galaxy s3 has
its own set of lock screen options so
does the iPhone 5 you can access the
camera or control your music but more
importantly you can access Siri even
when the screen is off with the single
button letting you get to what you want
even faster 38 reminders and tasks
unlike on the s3 the built-in reminder
app on the iPhone 5 not only lets you
drop your tasks down but it can even
remind you to do
something when you get to a specified
location 39 unlike on the galaxy s3 you
can easily get to your photo gallery by
swiping to the left after you're taking
a picture on the iPhone 5 okay we're
down to our last ten reasons reason
number forty the iPhone 5 is better than
the galaxy s3 is the ability to set
custom vibrations meaning you can
program the iPhone 5 to vibrate in a
custom pattern and then set that pattern
to a contact so even when your phone is
in your pocket on vibrate you know
exactly who's calling you 41 iMessage on
the iPhone 5 you can message any other
iOS device using iMessage
what makes iMessage different from your
standard text as you can see if your
message was delivered and it feels red
you can also even see if the person is
typing something back 42 on the iPhone 5
you can set up a VIP email inbox that
filters through your email only showing
you the messages that are from the
people you team as a VIP 43 the iPhone 5
lets you get pop-up notifications right
from the lockscreen which means you can
read a text message without ever having
to unlock your phone
44 airplay on the iPhone 5 you can
easily mirror what you're looking at on
your phone with your Apple TV so whether
you're browsing the web playing a game
or looking at pictures you can see it on
the big screen all without a water
alright we're almost there reason number
45 the sixth generation iPhone is better
than the Galaxy s3 is the iTunes remote
with the remote app you can control the
iTunes on your computer from your iPhone
5
this works through your Wi-Fi connection
so you can control your music from
anywhere in your Wi-Fi range 46 speaking
of music let's not forget that the
iPhone 5 doubles as an iPod giving you a
great music app that gives you extra
features like shake the shuffle and an
equalizer
with a beautiful Cover Flow interface
that only makes the experience even
better 47 on the iPhone 5 you have the
passbook app that conveniently keeps
things like your boarding passes movie
tickets store cards and even coupons all
in one place
there are currently just over a dozen
apps that work with passbook with more
and more to be added into the future 48
because the galaxy s3 is such a popular
phone
there are thousands and thousands of
accessories you could choose for it but
the iPhone 5 is even more popular which
means that they're even more accessories
available for it this is evidenced by a
quick search on Amazon with accessories
for the iPhone 5 more than doubling the
results than for the galaxy s3 49 on the
iPhone 5
you can enable photo streams which
allows you to share the photos you take
on your phone with other iOS devices its
innervated right into the Photos app and
goes beyond just normal sharing with
notifications indicating when new photos
are added to a stream you're following
and with the ability to comment on a
photo after you're done viewing it we
are finally here reason number 50 the
iPhone 5 is better than the galaxy s3 is
the easier backup and sync options you
have with both iCloud and iTunes alright
guys that's it for me in this video
obviously I couldn't list every reason
why the iPhone 5 is better than the s3
so go ahead and comment on the ones I
missed if you liked the video please

their channel for more videos just like
this alright thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
