have another foam of style video this
time a drop test between the galaxy sm+
and the iPhone 10 as Smacks now what's
interesting about this drop test is on
the one hand you have the iPhone which
Apple claims is using the strongest
glass to ever be used in a smartphone or
at least that's what they were saying
back when they announced it and then on
the other hand you have the galaxy s 10
plus which is using the new Gorilla
Glass 6 which at least according to
Corning the company who makes Gorilla
Glass can survive drops up to 2 times
better than Gorilla Glass 5 which is
what Samson was using on their phones
last year which of course begs the
question which one of these two very
expensive smartphones is actually more
durable and of course if you don't want
to drop a thousand dollars on a smart
phone you can always check out this new
3d smart phone that comes in at just
under $300 from the sponsor for today's
video in rocket so rocket just launched
a number of new smart phones that offer
some pretty unique features without
breaking the bank
the i/o 3d and 3d pro used patented
screen technology that allowed them to
play 3d contents without needing to wear
3d glasses for contents rocket is
including one month of their rock flick
service for free which they say has the
most extensive 3d library in the world
but going beyond just 3d all their smart
phones include 12 months of rock talk
for free where you can make unlimited
outbound domestic and international
calls over Wi-Fi and you also get 12
months of rock health for free where you
can talk to a personal doctor whenever
you need and benefit from pharmacy
savings of up to 75% on prescriptions
rocket also has other bundled services
like roadside assistance and music at a
low monthly cost which you can learn
more about in addition to learning with
new smartphones at the first link down
below in the description alright let's
get to the drop test round number one
backdrop in three two one
after the backdrop both phones have
their rear glass damaged the Gorilla
Glass six on the Galaxy has 10 plus
didn't really seem to make any
difference here despite all of Corning's
claims with the glass completely
shattering and spider webbing all across
the back the iPhones glass on the other
hand while not completely undamaged did
significantly better with its back
having just a few cracks and you know
although it's big protruding camera lens
did get a few scuffs around its housing
the iPhone did well enough here to get
the win in round number one round number
two corner drop in three two one the
screens on both phones remain undamaged
after that corner drop which is actually
pretty impressive when you consider just
how thin the bezels are on these devices
and while both phones did receive a few
scuff marks on the corners themselves
there really isn't much of a difference
between the two making it a tie in the
corner drop round number three face drop
three-to-one the face drop did its
damage to both phones though cracks on
the iPhone are mostly contained to the
bottom corner of the screen whereas the
s tense cracks spiderweb all across the
front and to make matters worse after
doing our fifteen point inspection where
we test everything from the cameras and
sensors to the flashlight and charging
port we found that the s tens finger and
scanner under the glass no longer works
like no matter how many times we tried
how much pressure we applied we just
couldn't unlock the phone with a
fingerprint we even tried restarting the
S 10 without any luck and after going
into the settings the s 10 wouldn't even
allow us to register a new fingerprint
so a really really disappointing result
for the s 10 plus here giving the win to
the iPhone in round number 3 bonus round
okay so while the
sans fingerprint scanner no longer works
the good news is everything else still
does meaning it gets to go on to the
bonus round now we call it the bonus
round because it's the least important
round in this test due to the fact that
nobody really drops their smartphone ten
times consecutively
however this brown does at least give
you an idea as to the impact and shock
resistance on a phone
last time the iPhone was able to survive
three consecutive drops before the area
between these seconds and the third rose
on the touchscreen stopped working so
we'll see if the galaxy as 10-plus can
do any better and three two one
so one bonus shop in phone looks like
it's good if the screen works yes it
does all right let's move on three two
one that was amazing this fell flat no
balance just stuck the landing
can we call yes we can and uh one more
drop buddy and you're done all right
drop number ten and three two one so
some glass flew out just for the grand
finale this insane totally ridiculous
bonus round and bone is still going can
make an emergency call if we need it to
all right it passed so after ten
consecutive drops from just under one
and a half meters the sn+ seems to still
be going relatively strong we checked if
all those drops smack some sense back
into the fingerprint scanner but as
expected it's still Ino in that
department but otherwise the camera and
the touchscreen still remain fully
functional so a pretty good result in
the bonus round
okay so with all four rounds in the
books it's time to take a look at the
scorecard the way scoring works here is
the winner of each round always receives
ten points with the loser of each round
receiving somewhere in between six and
nine points depending on how much worse
it did so in the first round the Gorilla
Glass six on the s ten plus didn't seem
to help at all with it shattering
significantly worse than the iPhone in
the second round both phones held up
rather nicely and the third both bones
cracked but the galaxy has ten suffered
one of the worst results we've had in a
while with the functionality of its
fingerprint scanner being completely
destroyed and finally in the fourth
round the SN proved that while a single
drop can kill its fingerprint scanner at
least its other components have great
impact and shock resistance but in the
end the S tense more shattered glass and
the failure of the fingerprint scanner
caused it to match making the winner of
this drop test the iPhone 10's max
anyways that is it for me in this video
thank you guys for watching and as
always I'll see you in the very next
episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
