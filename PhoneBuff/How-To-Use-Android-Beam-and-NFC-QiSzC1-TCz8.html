Volcom and in this video I'm going to
show you how to use NFC and Android Beam
on your Ice Cream Sandwich and above
device with NFC capabilities so the
first thing you don't want to do is
actually enable NFC and Android Beam in
your settings so go over to your
settings and from this main tab go over
to more and under more you want to make
sure that NFC is actually checked and
also the Android Beam the little on
switch is flipped to on so make sure it
doesn't look like this make sure it's
actually to the on position and do this
on both devices so make sure it's
checked and on on both devices and once
you've done that you're ready to
actually beam something over so I'll go
ahead and zoom out and bring in my other
Galaxy Nexus so here it is let me unlock
it really quick so I'll go ahead and
demonstrate how NFC works or Android
Beam works so let's say I wanted to send
over an app for example I have Skyfire
right here let's say it's a browser I
enjoy and my friend's Galaxy Nexus
doesn't have it so if I wanted to send
it over to them I can just put both
devices back-to-back like that you see
it says touch to beam all gauges touch
it like that you hit that little
animation that gives an impression that
something was sent over and indeed it
was you can see I was taken to the
Android Market so I could actually
download Skyfire right onto my phone so
that's one way in which it works you
could also send over a contact so say I
wanted to send over a contact right here
over to my friends phone I can just put
the phone's back-to-back press the B
button and you can see now that this
foam is has a gray screen gives me an
option to choose which account
I want to sync the contact to if I
choose it there you go and now you can
see that the contact is now added to
this next phone so it's pretty cool
functionality now one thing that's
actually disappointing about it is the
inability to actually be mobile pictures
for example out of this picture of this
mountain with snow on it say I wanted to
send it to my friend or be mean to my
friend put my devices back-to-back it
makes that little noise but I don't get
any option to actually beam it over so
that's really this morning hopefully umm
Google addressed this in a future update
I know there
few apps that let you actually take
advantage of that so you can definitely
download a third-party up to do it but I
would just like to see it built into the
OS outright all right listen for me in
this video Steve Ballmer calm thank you
for watching it and don't forget to
visit for more calm more cellphone news
reviews and how to's thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
