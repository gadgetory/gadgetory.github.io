being over a year old the iPhone success
is still technically the fumble style
speed test champ and while I already
beat most of 2016 flagship smartphones
there is one phone that it hasn't faced
off against yet and that is its own
successor in the iPhone 7 so today we're
going to see if the quad-core a 10
fusion chip inside the iPhone 7 is all
that is cracked up to be
and if so just how much of a difference
it actually makes but before we get into
it I want to give a big shout-out to
Braintree payments for sponsoring
today's video so developing your own
mobile app can be complex but
integrating your own payment option no
longer has to be with Braintree your
business can accept nearly every type of
payment from any device with just one
integration everything from pesos to
PayPal to Android pay and whatever
payment option comes next
Braintree simple flexible SDKs make your
job and your payments easier learn more

alright let's get right into it so we'll
kick this thing off by starting these
stopwatches on each phone where the
iPhone 7 gets to step over the iPhone
success by snapping the photo a bit
quicker as both phones just blaze
through that first row of system apps
and move on to the gaming row where the
iPhone 7 looks to maintain its early
lead over the success with it being just
about a split second ahead of it but the
6s is proving why it has been the
undefeated speedtest champ for so long
with it doing a pretty good job at
keeping up with the iPhone 7 here in the
gaming row only falling maybe a second
or two behind despite having the older a
9 chip under the hood but I have a
feeling that a 9 chip is going to show
its age during this next task in lab sit
where both balls will have to create a
time lapse from the same exact video
file now this is the most processor
intensive task in this whole speed test
and as you can see the iPhone 7 and its
new a10 fusion chip completes it at a
much faster rate than the a9 packing
success so while the iPhone 7 finally
got itself some separation between it
and the success after lapses it is worth
noting that this was mainly because
laughs it really pushes the processors
on each phone and with the iPhone 7
having the latest and greatest processor
from Apple
it obviously bear
better finishing the first slap or the
time of one minute and eight seconds but
what I think is interesting here is
outside of lab sit the iPhone success
didn't actually fall too far behind in
all the other apps within finishing the
first lab twelve seconds later with the
time of one minute and twenty now this
just goes to show you how much of a role
storage read and write speeds play in
loading up apps and games with both the
iPhones here having super fast and vme
storage so there you go the iPhone 7
finishes with a total time of one minute
and 34 seconds with that first lap
seeming to have made all the difference
with the iPhone 6s finishing the speeds
has 14 seconds later with the total time
of 1 minute and 48 seconds making the
winner and new fumble style speeds has
champ the iPhone 7 that is it for me in
this video thank you guys for watching
and as always I'll see you in the very
next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
