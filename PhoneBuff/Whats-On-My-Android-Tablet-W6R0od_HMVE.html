Falmouth calm and today I'm doing a
what's on my tablet video on my Asus
Nexus 7 so this is actually my
day-to-day driver when it comes to a
tablet you know I have other tablets
such as the iPad and the Galaxy Note
10.1 but this is the one I prefer to
carry around on me because you know it's
small its light and of course is running
the latest version of Android which is
jellybean 4.1.1 so it definitely gets a
job done for me I'll go ahead and show
you you know what's on it's the first
thing you'll see is of course the home
screen it's completely empty all my home
screens are actually empty other than
the main one and all I have is the
weather widget which gives me a time
which is definitely something that you
want you know I want to be looking at
the time on there and I get the weather
for today I get a little preview of the
upcoming week and then of course I get
the date on the left and you know these
are lower shortcut so you cap I can tap
on here it'll go to my calendar and then
I get top of course on here on the clock
and go to my alarm and then if I tap on
the little weather over here it takes me
to my weather widget and what's cool
about this is I could actually scroll
through different cities so this is HD
we're just an Interphone review on phone
book comp you guys want to check that
out in more detail but anyway that's
what I have on my home screen at the
bottom you know on my taskbar or dock I
have of course Google Chrome because
mainly I use the browsing on my tab you
know for everything else I got all of my
apps I use my smart phone but on my
tablet you know the browsing is the main
feature that I like to have on here of
course I have a calculator I want to do
a quick calculation and you know doing
it on here is pretty huge so it's pretty
cool I have this app right here which is
called catch so I'm gonna show you guys
it's really quick I'll probably be doing
a review on it in the future this is
actually my new note-taking app you know
I used to use color note which I
definitely still like and there's some
advantage that offers that this one
doesn't but this one has a really clean
user interface and you'll notice that
this is a theme when it comes to my tab
but I only like applications that have
you know a very clean user interface
especially they have like the ICS design
guideline you know type user interface
and of course it's gotta work it too so
it's not gonna look good it's gotta work
it so this one you know fills both needs
so you can see I have a few labels over
here I can go ahead and tap on
but when you see I have a little
checklist for videos so you know I just
made this really quick of course right
now I'm doing it what's on my Nexus 7
tablet you can see my next video is
gonna be why I don't route my phone
right away but let's say I'm you know
done with this video let's go ahead and
check it hit back and save it of course
you know you could attach a file you
could attach a photo a voice memo or a
reminder you could share it of course
you can favorite it and delete it up
here and what school's up here you could
actually go into different spaces so
basically they're like labels and you
know I have one phone book and I'll have
a few others I just started using this
recently but definitely liked it so
check that out but of course like I said
I'm gonna be doing a review on it in the
future
got my Gmail app which I have to my
gmail accounts on here of course I gotta
use that have Google Play right here
because I definitely like checking out
you know new apps on my tablet
cuz you know it's pretty fun especially
games stuff with this uh Nvidia
processor got YouTube you know gotta
have YouTube on here so go ahead and
show you guys my feed really quick on my
tablet I actually have a different
account logged in but has a lot of like
educational videos that I'm subscribed
to on here because it's pretty cool
anyways go ahead and go into my app
launcher and you can see I have a couple
of apps on top level of Google analysis
so this is basically how I check my
stats on like bomb buff calm to see you
know how many people visited of course
have my banking apps for Bank of America
chase and I have Capital One but I don't
have the capital 1 app on here because
it doesn't support the full screen mode
of my travel yet so doesn't make the cut
of course the icy catch calendar camera
pretty basic stuff chrome of course my
file explorer i use is ES file explorer
so I use on my phone and of course on my
tablet I just like it because you know
you could customize it you know right
now have it in the list mode you can
make a grid mode it's really clean you
know gets the job done the menu options
are great and it's free so can't really
beat it and also if you rooted it takes
you up to you know the root of the phone
or the tablet in this case you know like
I said I'm running completely stock so
I'm not rooted just yet of course that
Facebook you know I don't really use
Facebook all that much same goes with
the Google+ I don't really use it but
they're good apps and I do you know
occasionally going this will have it
I have Flipboard which is really cool
United this recently started to using
this may be a
- ago and I like you know being able to
read through articles like this and if I
want to see more just tap on it and go
to it but that is that what else we have
in here
Fox Sports something I definitely love
having what's happened you know when I'm
watching football and Sundays are I'm
watching basketball I just open this app
up and that way I'm able to you know
keep track of all the stats you know
keep track of my fantasy teams you know
I'll go to scores for example and then
be able to see all the stats well this
is an upcoming game so I won't be able
to see it but anyway Fox Sports the
reason why I choose this over the ESPN
app is usually ESPN app but the ESPN app
doesn't look as good you know and like I
said I really wanted something you know
basically we might tap I'm really really
picky and I wanted something that looks
really good you know on my phone I use
the score Center app still but on here's
pretty cool cuz you have videos that you
can go from thank you see from Fox when
you go to media and you can watch them
right here in tablet and with the such
big screen something you probably want
to do let's go ahead and go on so I have
the global up application is called
global basically this is just a little
demonstration of the Nvidia you know
tell you three processes oh can the
volume way down there so basically this
shows off the graphics over here you
know I don't know I just have it on here
because it's pretty cool it's a kind of
like a show-off thing once it's all kind
of tablets and you know I go ahead and
start bragging but anyway that's the
global application HD widgets mint.com
not a login because that's all my
personal finance stuff but I definitely
recommend this it's a great way to keep
track of your finances you know you get
to see your net worth and it's one of
the best ways to actually you know keep
track of expenses as you can see I have
Scylla right here which is mortgages
lets you you know calculate you know how
much loan payments gonna be how much the
interests gonna be etc the reason why I
have it on here and as long as our along
with my Trulia app right here is because
I am looking for a new house right now
so that's why I have them of course I'm
not gonna have them all the time so
might not be something you're interested
in if we don't if you're not looking for
a new house anyway this is the Tegra
zone which is basically what you want if
you have a tag of 3 or a Tegra processor
just gives you all the news right here
you get games that are supported you
know for specifically for your a
processor like that
I've done you know reviews on the
channel before about us I won't go too
far into this me back all apparently
won't let me back out yet they hit home
but anyway I will go on what else Google
Wallet on here I've never used it I mean
I don't know how I'm going to use my
tablet for that but oh
papyrus I did a video on that as well
it's a basically you know it it's not
note-taking app it's more or less like a
what is it called a little painting app
you know so you could draw things if you
want so that's pretty cool
I did a phone review and if you guys
want to check that out I'm the only app
really on my phone or on my tablet I say
that you know doesn't really meet the
design guidelines is this Volume+ app
you can see like the it doesn't actually
fit the whole screen and it has the old
Gingerbread settings layout it doesn't
have like ICS hopefully the developer
updates is soon but it doesn't really
matter to me because I only use this one
thing and that's to amplify the speaker
on my next seven the speaker on here is
pretty weak you know I did I talked
about that in my review on the Nexus 7
but it's really weak so when I don't
know it seems to be a theme with Nexus
devices lately but I enabled this guy
and it sounds like it should which is
good because watching YouTube videos
like I mentioned earlier we're really
hard to do with that weak speaker but
that's pretty much it I mean like I said
I'm very very minimalistic actually I
didn't mention one thing you verse so I
have a tin to you verse for my you know
TV and I could go through you know all
my recordings manage them and delete
them still kind of sad to see that you
know the iPhone version or the iOS
version has a better u-verse app because
you actually have at a remote way to
control your TV from your phone or
tablet the Android version doesn't have
a yet which is pretty much has been a
theme for over the last couple years
like the iOS version gets a new feature
first and then the Android version gets
but not that big of a deal to me I mean
I have a remote it's not a big deal but
yeah that's pretty much it I mean
everything else you know the stock you
know browser I do it on there I have of
course Google now and could do voice
search and all that good stuff so that's
pretty much all I need on my tablet like
I said the main thing I use on here is
the browsing and lately I've been using
it the Trulia app for real estate
listings a lot because it's a great way
to be able to actually go through a
prefer looking on through the app then
actually going to the Trulia what
which is you know it says a lot but oh I
forgot one more app Ted so Ted is just a
kind of like a it's a website that lets
you see a whole bunch of videos from
speakers that talk about you know pretty
much educational stuff I'm really into
that kind of stuff you know you could
look into for example I'm really into
science so I can go into the science on
you know for example the brain and watch
a whole bunch of videos of you know the
professionals are the industry experts
that talk about in the brain and all
this stuff so I definitely like that you
know I check out those videos once one
you know I like to have it on my tablet
versus my phone because it's bigger
screen but that's pretty much it for
what's on my tablet very minimalistic
like I said I like to keep it clean but
thank you for watching the video if you
found it helpful give me a thumbs up and
if you haven't already subscribed to
channel thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
