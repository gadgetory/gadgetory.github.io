phone book calm and in this video we're
talking about a question or more or less
frustration that a lot of you guys have
I certainly have it which is why do
android phones take so long to get
updated to the next version of the West
you know why is it that the iphone iOS
get updated pretty much as soon as apple
announces it why is it that Windows
Phone which this HT 7 over here which is
a year in a poll gets updated to the
latest version of the west which is
mango 7.5 yet a phone does more recently
released in either these guys like the
Galaxy Note just barely got the update
to ice cream sandwich which the latest
version on Android which is seven months
after the Galaxy Nexus was launched with
I shouldn't say I went back in November
you know why is that this guy just
barely get updated and this is the
international unlocked version this time
and talked about the carrier branded
version on AT&amp;amp;T for that matter any
carrier branded phone whether it's HTC
LG motorola or Samsung I mean pretty
much most phones out there don't have
ICS or Android 4.8 percent do and a big
portion of that is due to HTC One series
sales and new phones are coming out with
ice cream sandwich course a lot of
phones are being updated just now but
it's still seven months down the line
which to me is way too long but you know
this is turning into a rant but let me
tell you guys you know let's go back to
the question why is it that way so I'm
not going to answer that question my
theories because everybody has their own
theories but I'll go to you know
somebody in the know which is an
executive from Motorola her name is
Christie Wyatt and basically what she
says is when Google releases a new
version of the software for example Ice
Cream Sandwich they do a version that's
made specifically for that phone that
they work on so for example the Galaxy
Nexus so the rest of the Android
ecosystem out there doesn't get to see
the new software and tell pretty much we
see it so basically that's part of the
delay because they don't get it you know
as soon as you would think and you know
that's a issue that at least apple
doesn't have and anyway um she goes on
to say that hardware is the biggest
issue when it comes to updating the
phone because there's multiple chipsets
there's multiple radio bands for
multiple countries on these phones
and that's really what takes a big
portion time to adjust all the firmware
to work for that and then you have the
custom UI of course which does one of my
major you know things that you know I
always thought that was a custom UI that
took all the time for the updates but
yet it seems to be a small portion or
any way it does add on to the amount of
time to update your phone and then
lastly these phones have to get approved
by manufacturers it has a whole bunch of
many are I'm sorry carriers because it
has a limit of carrier bloatware on
there so they have to make sure their
apps work and all these things end up
adding on to the amount of time that it
takes for you to get update that's why
it's seven months down the line and we
still haven't seen updates for your
phone and you know maybe jellybean five
points will be coming up soon and yet
your phone still gonna be stuck on
gingerbread hoping to get ice cream
sandwich others kind of really
ridiculous but anyway this is the way it
is that's the reason so that's why you
know you could get a phone like the
Nexus you're not going to have to wait
for the carrier to approve it because
it's the unlocked hspa+ word and of
course the verizon version will take a
little bit longer to get updated this is
the phone that Google built the soft one
builds the software on until they
release the next Nexus so that's another
you know step out of the process which
makes it get updates a little bit faster
and of course you know the same hardware
is on here so anyway that's why the
Nexus gets updated faster on Windows
Phone they've really require stop really
restricts the hardware that can be used
by manufactures a lot of are the same
processors the same three button layout
the same resolution on the screen where
on Android you know it's all over the
map the phones are all different which
is you know a great thing about android
but it comes at a cost and of course the
iphone and I was um Apple knows you know
the software is gonna be going on this
guy from the very beginning there's only
one phone or at least one recent phone
which is you know the for s1 processor
to work with and it doesn't have any
carrier blower on here so they don't
have to worry about that either so
that's why this gets updated so fast too
so anyway this one make a quick video
about this to let you guys you don't
know what's going on and hopefully you
know with the new Nexus initiative that
Google looks to be rolling out which I
made a video about on the channel
hopefully it means manufacturers get the
software in their hands a little bit
earlier and hope you can see up his
litter but anyway the super me in this
video thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
