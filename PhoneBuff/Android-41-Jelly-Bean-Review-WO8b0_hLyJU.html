this video we're doing a walk through
our overview of Android 4.1 jelly bean
avoiding tronic device because one of
the first differences that you'll notice
on version 4.1 is the new boot up
animation so I'm gonna let you guys look
at that also while this is loading up
I'll let you know that I do feel like
the applicable time is a little bit
faster not something that's super
dramatic but I have noticed that it
seems that about 5 seconds faster than
it was before there he goes the new boot
up animation you can see it's just a
little X in the middle of the screen
before I take up the whole screen and
now is just a little X I'm not sure if I
like this one more for like the old one
more but I don't really mind the
difference really I'm not really booting
up my phone all that much so you see you
already booted up so definitely is a
little bit quicker
next thing you notice that's different
on 4.1 is the lockscreen so as soon as I
tap my finger on this you can see you
actually have a new option which is
Google now you could unlock like you did
before and go to the camera and when I
move my finger around you can see those
little white dots that kind of follow my
finger so looks pretty nice too I'll go
to unlock this guy and we're going to
show you the version number really quick
so I'll go to settings and go down to
about phone and you can see I am on a
version 4.1 and of course if I tap this
guy like four times it takes me to this
thing and if I press and hold on it
basically see open to jelly beans
letting you know that you are running
android jelly bean you can move these
guys around so pretty cool I'm just
gonna back out of here nothing that's
nothing big next thing that you'll
notice on the Galaxy Nexus is the just a
general a west speed so I'll go ahead
and tap the Start menu or the
application drawer and you get to see it
doesn't lag at all before
I remember my phone would stutter a
little bit and I would complain about it
you know in my videos a lot but anyway
seems to be a lot faster I'm just
scrolling through is a lot faster and
now you can see also that the widgets
have a different background now before
it was actually just the icon on a flat
black background well now it's a little
gray box surrounding it I feel like it
does make it a little look a little bit
cleaner there's some new widgets like
the
Google post via Google search you have a
new messaging widget so a few new ones I
haven't really downloaded any apps on
this phone just yet other than Engadget
Chrome and another one I forgot what it
was but anyway that's that we'll go
ahead and go to the wallpaper so you can
see when I press and hold or long press
on the home screen it's not that
vertical window it's a more of a boxy
one and I can choose a wallpaper so
before on version 4.0 - at least the
wallpapers will flag like crazy so now
I'll just go ahead and add this so live
wallpapers lag now you can see it's nice
and smooth so definitely something that
you know I like on here let's see the
next thing I want to show you is Google
now so I'll go ahead and lock the screen
and you can see when i unlock it I could
go straight up to what they call Google
now basically it's a whole bunch of
cards that you know it's showing you the
phone or what the phone thinks that you
want to see at that moment so you can
see before I search for Laguna Hills
weather and it shows it I haven't really
used this much so it doesn't have that
much information to go off of but I hit
show sample cards to show you what it
would look like and you'd have things
like this like whether you'd have
traffic information so if you're going
to work every day eventually a catch
your pattern and realize that you know
you'd want to see what the traffic is
going home so pretty cool I'm you know
sports scores and things like that
definitely something that you know is
nice on here um I'll go ahead and hit a
sample card so you can see this is for a
appointment so if you have something in
the calendar it'll show up if you want
to look at traffic you see 18 minutes to
go home just little examples here and
that's what will show up once you start
using this more and more so definitely a
cool option also you could get straight
to that from the home screen so you got
the lock the screen to get so you
actually tap the home button right here
and swipe up and there you go so
definitely cool I also want to show you
the new voice search or voice action so
this tap on this guy do a quick search
when was Martin Luther King born you can
see now so it has a little voice now
which sounds pretty good compared to
like s voice I feel like s boys a little
bit more robotic but anyway you can see
it's more Syria like in this sense
because it shows a picture it shows a
date within the window before we're just
open up the browser and now
some searches it'll still open up the
browser but actually that will do
weather weather in Irvine California
okay never mind that want to open up in
here but anyway get the idea so I get
asked different questions like how tall
is Michael Jordan so you can see how
fast it is to UM you can ask some
different questions to like for example
is it gonna rain tomorrow so that's
definitely really cool um definitely
seems like Siri like feature so I
definitely like it it's really fast too
so pretty cool the next thing I want to
show you is the how the widgets and the
shortcuts move around so for example
let's say I have this stroke I want to
move it around I could actually go over
here or going between my apps and it'll
kind of bounce them around to get to
where I want so pretty cool I know that
HTC did that with their Sense UI another
thing that is new is the widgets
automatically resize I know that
TouchWiz actually did this with their UI
but I'll go ahead and up pull out a
resizable widget so I'll just do uh
which one should I do
will do Gmail so let's go to Gmail tap
it on here tap my email account really
quick all right you can see like it'll
actually reset I don't know if this
one's actually gonna resize oh yeah it
does okay let's make it bigger first so
that way I could actually resize because
that was the smallest was that so anyway
I'll go over and I let's say I want to
set it over here see how just resize
like that so pretty cool makes it a lot
easier to manage your homescreen so I do
like that feature let's see what else
there is also a predictive text on the
keyboard so I'm looking at my notes
right now so I'll open up the keyboard
and now what I type
here it'll actually try to predict the
next word so I'll say this okay that
didn't work I press the home button this
is see how it shows me the next word I
think somewhere type so I can actually
type the first time I have been sent so
you get the idea um the more you use the
keyboard the better you'll be able to
predict your common phrases so another
cool thing so I'm yeah is this really
something you have to use for awhile
before you could really take advantage
of all the features in here but I'll go
ahead and go out of there another thing
about the keyboard is the dictation
keyboard so it actually works offline
now so for example what are you doing
and that this will actually work you
could also pause that you see you see
this little option right here on the
bottom left this is actually to bring
the keyboard down so cool little option
to have right there wasn't there before
so that's definitely new and definitely
welcome to because I do like that let's
see if I'm missing anything
oh the notification bar so you can see
the notification bar does look new you
can see it shows the time a lot bigger
shows the date right here these settings
little button got a little bit bigger so
a lot easier to tap on it now get to
everything a little bit faster I want to
go ahead and now show you how
notifications look I'll go ahead and
I'll just download some apps really
quick so go to my apps download some of
my recent apps because I just flashed
this guy so I don't have anything on
here really
let's do square really quick and by the
way I did review on this on phone but
you guys are interested and let's do a
is File Explorer because I definitely am
gonna want that so anyway we went ahead
and download those so you can see the
notification bar looks the same as far
as when it's closed but when you open it
up it's gonna look a little bit
different so go ahead and show you you
can see now that the notifications are
actually a little bit separated they
also have that grey background kind of
like the widgets do and to clear it out
you're gonna press this button right
here so instead of saying clear you just
press this guy and boom it takes a
Ralph's screen I'll go back to the
multitasking really quick because I want
to show you
so for all the OS speed and you can just
see dang I don't have any enough open
I'm just gonna open up a whole bunch of
apps really quick so calculator will
open up
yes file explorer and that will open up
let's see will do
gallery so there you go now i'll tap the
motel so you can see this flies through
the OS there's no lag before i noticed a
lot more lag now when i want to close my
apps
it just does does it really really quick
but anyway that's pretty much it oh you
know what last thing i want to show you
is the when you press the power key it
looks a little bit different now you
have the option to turn your phone on
vibrate or silent right from here so
looks a little bit different like i said
gordon turn it off nothing really
different about the turn off
i shall not even turn off there's
nothing different but anyway that's
pretty much it for me i'm not that big
of differences india new update it
wasn't something like you know like
revolutionary like Ice Cream Sandwich
was but it wasn't an incremental update
and definitely welcome can't wait those
guy comes out on phones like the galaxy
s3 do really see what I could do with
that hardware but anyway sit for me in
