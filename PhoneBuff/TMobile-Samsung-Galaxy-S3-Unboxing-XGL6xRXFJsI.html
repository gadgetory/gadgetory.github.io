calm and instead of doing an unboxing on
the samsung galaxy s3 as you can see
it's the t-mobile version still has that
4.8 inch Super AMOLED display got the
1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon s4 dual-core
processor 8 megapixel camera 4G NFC all
that other good stuff go ahead and get
right to the unboxing I'll pull the
scroll tab off and here's the Box one
thing I've done is I just cut this guy
open so I could you don't easily open it
up in the video but haven't really
opened it up after that as you see there
you go so the first thing you see is the
device itself and I'll go ahead and pull
it out and I will go over that in just a
second but pull that to the side you get
your t-mobile micro SIM card and then
just a little thing that holds the box
or the phone and I'll see if I can pull
this guy out there you go alright so you
got your normal you know start guides
your merchandize turn label terms and
conditions and on the inside we've got
headphones which is awesome because you
know they didn't have headphones on the
galaxy s2 or at least some of the
variants and that's nice to see that
they brought these guys back you have
your typical micro USB to USB adapter
got your earbuds for your headphones and
then you have your battery here at the
bottom this is the 21 million or 20 100
million battery and then on last thing
in the Box is the micro USB adapter wall
adapter so while that's pretty much it
for what's in the box let's go ahead and
put these guys to the slide if I can
alright and up here he goes the device
itself and as you can see you've got
that little screen protector that shows
you where everything is the LED
indicator up here power volume I'm just
gonna pull this guy right off and I can
see the beautiful beautiful display
let's go ahead and pull the back side
off as well and go ahead and power it up
power it up and die while I'm powered
and up I'll do a size comparison with
some of the other device
it's gonna move the stuff out of the way
real quick so move that to the side
that's the side alright let's go ahead
and pull this guy open okay guess all
this rip it all right so let's prop the
back cover off so you can do it right
here at the top just pull it off like
that kind of like the Galaxy Nexus is so
just prop that battery and I'm not gonna
put the SIM card in right now cuz it's
in my galaxy nice - speaking of let's go
ahead and prop this guy right back on
see this eMobile logo on the back shiny
pebble blue variant so uh feels really
really light first impression you know
it's really light in the hand definitely
noticeable compared to my Galaxy Nexus
go ahead and power it up and I'll let
you guys see the brew dope animation in
the boot up time of course we'll be
doing comparisons with pretty much every
popular phone here's the Galaxy Nexus so
it's a quick idea as far as the size
person it is noticeably thinner I don't
know if that's gonna show up on camera
but it is definitely noticeably thinner
than the Galaxy Nexus and then of course
we have the iPhone right here so I'll
get a quick size comparison there you go
it's already done loading up so really
really fast boot up time we'll go ahead
and skip that turn on Wi-Fi skip skip
next and not now come on just let me get
in next next finish close oh my gosh
no thanks so Dropbox you can see all
right there you go we're finally here
it's giving me tips because things I
don't know how to use the phone but
there you go got the galaxy s3 feels
really nice in the hand um definitely
like the way it looks let's see how this
holds up the shiny back you know I've
heard that it's gonna attract lot of
finger prints of fact I could already
see some fingerprints right here so
obviously I put a case on my phone most
of time so it's not really gonna bother
me that much but yeah that's the galaxy
s3 of course we'll be doing a more
in-depth you know review later on and
I'm gonna be doing comparisons to this
phone and this phone the Nokia Lumia 900
wherever it is and whole bunch more but
thank you for watching the unboxing and
tune in for more videos later on thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
