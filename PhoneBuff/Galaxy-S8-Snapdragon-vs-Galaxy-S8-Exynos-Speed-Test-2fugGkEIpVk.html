year this year the galaxy estate is
powered by two different chipsets if you
live in a country like the US or Canada
you're getting an SI powered by qualcomm
snapdragon 805 and if you live almost
anywhere else
you're getting Samsung's own Exynos
88-90 5 under the hood now while both of
these chips are similar they're both
using Samsung's 10 nanometer process and
both are coupled with 4 gigabytes of RAM
there are some differences the way the
individual cores are configured the
clocks because of cores
GPUs and even the software may be a
little bit different which begs the
question which one of these phones is
faster or is there even a difference
well only one way to find out let's get
into it all right we'll kick things off
by starting the stopwatches on each
phone and then jump right into the first
row of system apps where the Exynos
variant of the s8 gets the step over the
sap dragon variant after the camera app
but only by a fraction of a second and
while the Exynos loads Facebook's faster
the 5 second variant load snapchat
faster so both phones are now neck and
neck in Photoshop and it'll be
interesting to see what happened next in
lapses where both CPUs will be put to
the test
so we'll pay attention to the rate at
which each phone completes processing
this time-lapse where it looks like the
Exynos variant completed it at a faster
rate
improving on its lead as both balls move
on to subway surfers but delete the
external experience has over the
Snapdragon variant is a small one so
we'll see if we can create some
separation here in subway surfers and
know it's actually the opposite with the
Snapdragon variant loading the game
faster putting it right back into this
thing so neither phone has been able to
create any kind of real separation thus
far but there is still a few more apps
left to go here in this first lap with
the entire second lap remaining where
last year with the galaxy s7 the Exynos
variant had the advantage speaking of
which looks like the X and O's variant
has pulled ahead here in Crossy Road
recapturing the lead once again and
already moving on to bullet force which
by the way quick shout-out to everybody
who recommended using this game on
Twitter so we're loading the offline
practice mode here in bullet bores where
once again it looks at the Exynos
variant of the galaxy s a2 finished at a
faster rate
giving it the biggest latest ad so far
in the speed test now before we get into
the side
map I want to let you guys know about a
pretty big change in the way the second
lab will be performed in the past we
started in the second lab from the top
and work our way back down whereas from
now on we'll be starting from the bottom
and working our way back up which will
help provide more accurate results so
there you go the excel has finished the
first lap at the time of one minute and
41 seconds and the static and Varion
finish is four seconds later with a time
of one minute and 45 seconds so not much
of a difference there of course the big
question is how will each do in terms of
RAM management so the excel has bearing
failed to keep subway surfers open let's
see if the Snapdragon could and no it
has to reload the game as well now the
Snapdragon variant did load subway
surfers at a faster rate in the first
lap as I expected to do here in the
second so it should be able to close in
on the Exynos variants lead but to be
honest unless one of these phones has
more apps stored in RAM than the other I
don't think there will be much of a
difference and so far that certainly
seems to be the case they're pretty much
going toe-to-toe in the second lap as
they were in the first lab with the
xml's variant finishing just two seconds
ahead of the Snapdragon variants which
to means anything less than three
seconds is below the margin of error so
I'm going to have to call this one a tie
taking a look at the individual app load
of times from the first lap you can see
where one phone did better in one app
the other phone did better in another
app so don't worry your Galaxy s8
performs roughly the same as the next
guys which is something you can't really
say if you have a galaxy s7 anyways that
is it for me in this video thank you
guys for watching and as always I'll see
you in the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
