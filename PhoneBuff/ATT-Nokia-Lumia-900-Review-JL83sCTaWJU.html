and in this video i'm doing a review on
the nokia lumia 900 from AT&amp;amp;T I'm just
gonna be talking about some of the
things that I like and dislike about the
phone in this video and also just giving
you a walkthrough through the OS showing
you the differences between what comes
on the lumia compared to your typical
Windows Phone but before I go into the
review I want to do a quick hardware
tour so on the top left up device right
here you have your 1.3 megapixel front
facing camera of course you have your
Nokia logo right here got your 18 t logo
at the top right I don't know if that's
coming through on camera but agency logo
right here of course you have your 4.3
inch going diagonally display to clear
back AMOLED display 800 by 480 which is
currently the max on Windows Phone at
least until Apollo at the very bottom
you have your back start and search Keys
which is standard on Windows Phone on
the top of the device we have a few
things we have the 3.5 milimeter headset
jack right here we have the secondary
mic micro USB charging port and then the
Micro SIM door which could pop out to
put your micro sim on the right side of
the device we also have a couple of
things you have your volume rocker
volume up and down your power key to
turn the display off and on and of
course turn the device off and then your
camera button which is again standard on
Windows Phone at the bottom of the
device you have your speaker grill and
then just some wah little like icons or
trademarks but pretty much that's all on
the left side absolutely nothing this
clean all the way down and on the back
you have nothing but your LED flash
right here and of course your Carl Zeiss
a megapixel camera on the back so that's
pretty much the Lumia 900 definitely a
sleek looking phone um I do like the way
it looks it's not the thinnest phones
are all phones out there definitely I
mean it's actually nothing at all you
know compared to a phone like the iPhone
4s here and you can see the iPhone 4s is
definitely thinner than this guy and you
know there's a lot of phones out now
they're thinner than the iPhone so
definitely have a thinness like I said
but I don't know I just I do like to
design not necessarily because that
design you know blows me away by any
means but it
just that it's so different you know
like especially for windows phone a lot
of the windows phones out there we're
just kind of like you know a Android
phone converted to Windows Phone for
example the hd7 which is a phone that I
previously had on Windows Phone pretty
much like the HTC EVO and then you know
you have like the focus flash which is
like that Samsung Galaxy s2 and so on
but this guy is very unique to Windows
Phone and you know you're not gonna see
any phones that look like it other than
the Lumia 800 but anyway I'll go right
into the review talking about what I
like and dislike
first off I'll start with what I dislike
so that way I can end on a positive note
because I do like the Lumia 900 and
let's go right into it okay so there are
a few things that I dislike about the
phone and first of which is the fact
that the battery is internal and you
can't pull it out you know some people
like us in people hate it you know I do
like having the option being able to
replace my battery you know in case I'm
getting low and if I have an extra one
just swapping it like that but I do
understand you know a lot of phones out
there don't have that inter external
battery anymore and you know it's common
on the iPhone a lot of the new Android
phones are having it but usually those
devices do it to make the device thinner
and like I said this guy isn't thin so
that's the second thing I just like is
the thickness compare it against you the
iPhone really quick and you can see that
the Lumia is definitely thicker than
this guy I'll compare it to the Android
flagship which is the Galaxy Nexus and
again you can see the Lumia is thicker
than this guy not by that much but it is
thicker than the Galaxy Nexus and then
you compare it to an older Windows Phone
like the HD 7 which I refer to earlier
and you can see I it's about the same
the camera does bulge out on the HTC so
the milk is probably a little bit
thinner but you know at this point in
time I just expecting you know with this
being such an old device I expected this
guy to be a little bit thinner but it
isn't that big of a deal
thankfully um you know if you guys will
look in this phone because Nokia did
something smart and they rounded the
edges of the DES phone so you can see
the edges are rounded you compare that
to a phone like the iPhone 4s which the
edges are squared it does make it you
know a lot more comfortable to hold in
the hand never had squared edges like
the iPhone did I think you'd really feel
the thickness but because its rounded it
you know just feels a lot thinner than
it is so definitely a plus side for that
let's go ahead and talk about some
things I like what the phone first
which is you know what I like on
everyone that's fun but especially the
Lumia is the speed you know that 1.4
Giga stamp Dragon processor just flies
through the Windows Phone OS I mean
everything loads up as soon as you press
it I mean you know a tap on calculator
and it's open you know a tap on will do
calendar and it's open you know you get
the idea I mean it's really really fast
everything opens up quickly so you're
definitely not gonna feel like but
you've been using Windows Phone you're
used to that you know even with the one
gigahertz processor just fly through it
obviously with the 1.4 it's gonna go
even faster than that next thing I like
is the exclusive apps that come with the
Lumia for example the ESPN app because
see it's a live widget right here giving
me sports scores which the normal USP an
app on Windows Phone doesn't have and
also when you open this guy up it looks
completely different from the normal app
and I did a comparison if you guys wanna
you know look into their differences but
it definitely looks a lot cleaner you
have the social tap right here which the
normal app doesn't have I'm going back
out of here to show you another app
which is the Nokia Drive turn-by-turn
navigation obviously is something that's
kind of missing on Windows Phone I'm
your Bing Maps course but this guy's
actually turn-by-turn and not only is
the turn-by-turn navigation but it's
also stored on the device itself so if
you lose reception you're not gonna lose
your Maps you're still gonna have that
GPS I don't want to go too far into that
anyways that's definitely nice to have
there's also some more exclusives so
I'll go ahead and load up the
marketplace really quick this is
something I just really feel like ads a
lot of value to getting alumina I mean
obviously with the lumen you get the
great design the fast processor you know
the nice ClearBlack AMOLED display but
the exclusive apps could really set set
it apart from some of the other phones
like the focus flash for example you
know has a lot of things that Lumia has
aside from the camera on the back which
I feel like this guy's a little bit
better but anyway that's one thing I
like speaking of the camera you know
definitely do like it comparing it to my
other Windows Phones is definitely one
of the better ones out there probably
one of the best I haven't tried the one
on the Titan 2 yet which is a 16
megapixel so I have to try that guy
before I could you know make any
judgments but this guy is definitely
definitely a really good camera I
wouldn't say it's as good as the iPhone
4s this camera because I compared the
two while this one takes really good
shots and uh you know daylight for
example I'll show you some of the shots
that I took right here for example this
guy right here you could see
you know I took a picture this is
bananas and there's some daylight from
the window and this looks really really
nice
you know you zoom in and the quality's
really really awesome I don't know if
it's coming through on camera if you
guys could appreciate the clarity of
this picture
I also took a picture of like I get out
of here this guy right here this took a
picture of some green beans or green
peas and again it looks pretty good
definitely something I'm happy with but
for example if I take a picture of this
case and this is where I'm comparing
with the iPhones camera which you know
is pretty much the standard a lot of
people consider that the standard for
camera phones you know if I focus in on
this picture and take a picture like
that it looks pretty decent you know you
look at it you do see some of the ridges
on the case
but they're not that visible where you
know when you're looking at in real life
are you know even on this camp where you
could actually see there are more a lot
more prevalent there little ridges and
designs of this case where the Lumia 900
camera doesn't necessarily show that but
you take a phone like the iPhone 4s and
let's go ahead and take the same picture
again so take a picture of this guy
again
and there you go go back and you can see
is this a lot more prevalent this is
what it looks like more so you know with
the natural eye compared to what the
Lumia 900 is showing us so definitely
something that you know could be better
but again like I said compared to any
other Windows Phone I do like the camera
on the Lumia I'm guessing that the
Titans twos cameras gonna be a little
bit better but you know I haven't tried
it yet so I can't say anything about
that yet
speaker quality on the phone is pretty
good it's not necessarily loud you know
compared to some of the phones I've
tested but it's definitely not anemic
which is something I'm really thankful
for because I hate when speaker phones a
week you know you came and watch a
YouTube video you know and show friends
you know cuz this the the noise the
background noise will cover it up but
anyway speaker is pretty good on here
the LED flash seems to work pretty good
and I mean that's pretty much my review
on the phone I mean really when you get
a phone like this you're getting it
because you know you love the design I
definitely do and it's something I
definitely enjoyed even with the
thickness like I said I rounded I just
makes the experience a really nice the
ClearBlack display
you know on a Windows Phone is one of
the best available and this looks really
nice and again that 1.4 Giga
makes everything fly on Windows Phone
you know what else phones really fast to
us but on the Lumia 900 this feels even
faster and then lastly those exclusive
apps really is what you know separates
it at least for me like Nokia Drive is a
huge one to me the ESPN app is really
really cool on a big sports fan and I do
like that but I feel like for most
people with Nokia Drive probably a
bigger selling point but anyway it's
interesting how this is not actually
pre-installed for some reason so we can
pre-installed some that pre-installed
apps are the 18 T apps these are all
uninstalled boy he's got tap and hold on
it and then hit uninstall which I
absolutely love the fact that you can
take them off you have app highlights
and all these things you can remove
let's say you have tango video calls
pre-loaded Yellow Pages Mobile and
there's some of these other apps I
downloaded but anyways that's pretty
much it for me in this review of the
Lumia 900 if you're looking for Windows
Phone or a Windows Phone I definitely
definitely recommend this guy you know
the battery life is you know pretty
decent it's better than the one I had on
my HTC 7 so if you're coming from an
older Windows Phone device you know
you're definitely gonna be happy with
the Lumia 900 the camera is gonna give
you a lot better performance I also did
a 720p video sample on foam buff if you
guys check that out it does look pretty
good I mean it's the best at 720p is
gonna offer you until when this one
offers 1080p but anyway that's it for me
