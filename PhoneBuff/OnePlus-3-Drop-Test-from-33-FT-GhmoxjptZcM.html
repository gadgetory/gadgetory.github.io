you know the oneplus three has been my
daily driver for the last few months now
so when evolutive labs the company
behind the Rhino shield crashguard
wanted it team up with us and do a drop
test I figured it'd be interesting to
see how well their Rhino shield
crashguard protect 1+3
I mean they've got cases for the iPhone
7 and the galaxy s7 which are we putting
links you need down below in the
description but since the 1+3 is the
phone i've been personally using that's
the case we're gonna be testing here
today so the case itself is a bumper
case meaning it isn't one of those heavy
duty bulky cases that barely fit in your
pocket and end up hiding the design of
your phone but despite it not looking
like a heavy duty case it does offer a
heavy duty protection with what is
called shock spread technology which
basically is like having millions of
little micro airbags that help deflect
and absorb that impact energy when you
drop your phone which in theory allows
your phone to survive drops of at least
11 feet now they're saying at least 11
feet map up to put at least which is a
really big claim so doing what we do and
doing the extreme drop sets that you
guys have seen before we're gonna test
it we're gonna see what happens we can
put do it my own foam I'm probably gonna
switch phones anyway so I'm not like too
scared but let's get right into it all
right so the first job we're gonna do is
probably the most common and that's the
pocket drop right you're pulling your
phone out of your pocket
and you're clumsy and fall so see how it
does and I just kind of launched it out
what you probably wouldn't do but as you
can see phone looks perfect working
perfectly to the back got a few scuff
marks on the case itself but who cares
about that right the phone still works
vibrate function still works so let's go
to the next drop all right so drop
number two is let's say you want to all
right so the second most common drop
probably is let's say you're texting
someone and you know you just mind your
business and someone kind of bumps into
you and you're like oh shoot
it landed right on the corner so I was
actually a hard drop but the phone still
works there you go you can see fully
functional no damage to the phone itself
got another scuff mark right there on
the corner but phone is in perfect
condition vibrates which still work in
so wait let's see oh yeah there you go
still working so we are good so let's go
to the next drop all right so we can do
these common everyday drops all day long
but the reality is this case is rated to
survive drops of at least 11 feet so
we're going to take things to the next
level and drop it from the next level so
let's do that
all right guys we are going up the
stairs and I'm nervous for this guy this
is my daily driver actually formed a
bond with it no not really but it's a
damn good phone now putting a lot of
faith in this case up here so all right
think that's a good enough position
all right so drop test from really high
up I would not want to drop from here
myself because I think I might I might
break a leg I don't know maybe all right
three two one oh my gosh that was nasty
all right let's see what happened and
actually I could already see that the
phone is still working nice all right so
uh phone still work in take a look at it
you know what the phone still looks like
it's in perfect condition in fact the
case didn't get that scuff okay so I
guess is right there that it hit didn't
II actually get that scuffed up so
pretty impressive results which means
we're gonna do what I'm afraid to do and
take it to the next level
again well we're going up once again and
this time I don't know if it's going to
make it I mean it was rated at what 11
feet that was over 11 feet but this one
pushing things to the limit here you
know what you want take a look down look
at that that is high up we are high up
all right bet yes no I don't think so
I don't know this is and we've already
done a bunch of drops already so it's
weaker internally three two one oh my
lord
oh let's see what happened
I don't know I don't know who made it
I don't know we made it I really don't
that was I know there's no way uh-huh
and no frickin way
it survived and it's still working
fully functional holy crow
Wow so I mean I'd okay so maybe a hit
right there I'm guessing but the phone
work to see this The Cider function
works yep
slider function is still working oh my
gosh well I don't know I don't know
let's take it to the third level my gosh
all right so it's arrived the pocket
drop the you know chest drop the first
story the second story in fact I'm
walking up the stairs right now we're
just past the first story and I'm on the
second story yeah I mother no I don't
know I don't think I miss about the
second one so if it survives this one
I'm I'm really surprised that I survived
a second but this this would just be it
be outrageous
whoo all right bones still working how
do we know how high this is but damn is
freakin high you ready all right three
two one
yeah there's no way there's no way did
you hear that sound there's this is no
way well if anything this phone's got me
a workout make me go up more stairs than
that do all right
all right I'm yeah you guys heard that
sound there's this is no way this thing
survived but okay there you go
wait Oh y'all get the phone the phone's
dead
holy crap Wow well there you go I
actually like the screen part of it
actually showing up and working on the
corner here
that's a tough phone and damn it that's
a tough case that is as really high up
so moral of the story is you drop your
phone from regular situations gonna be
good you go a little bit extreme and
maybe somebody's mad at you and throws
it off of a off your balcony you're good
you look on the second or third floor
you're probably still good is this when
you get all the way up there they have
an issues so with that said damn I'm
impressed I mean this is not a
heavy-duty bulky case it's something
that actually still shows off the design
of the phone you know the phone is still
fully visible actually really like the
1+3 design and uh it does a decent job
at protecting it I mean a really good
job are you ever gonna drop your phone
from that high no I hope not if it you
do you deserve this result but even in
the more likely extreme scenarios you're
gonna be fine so with that said that is
it pour me in this video if you guys
enjoyed it
give it a big thumbs up big shout out to
evolutive labs for sponsoring today's
video and as always I'll see you in the
very next episode Bruce</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
