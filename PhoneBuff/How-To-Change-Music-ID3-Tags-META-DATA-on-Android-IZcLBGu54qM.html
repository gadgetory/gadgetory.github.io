i'm gonna be doing a quick how-to video
on how to change your musics id3 tags or
namely the the title the album and the
artist you need three things in order to
be able to do this first and foremost
you're gonna need to be rooted and have
root permissions on your phone second
you're going to need root explorer and
third you need SQLite editor both
rooting spore and SQLite editor are
downloadable from the Android
Marketplace alright so let me zoom in on
here and show you what I want to edit
today these songs artists mmm is fine
and the title goat is fine it's just the
album is showing up as something that's
not so I want to edit that so the zoom
out of here and do that you're gonna
need to first go into root explorer so
root explorer and it takes you to the
very root of your phone and from here
you want to go to DB data to access the
databases and then you hit databases and
it's gonna show you a whole bunch of
databases that you can edit for the
applications on your phone in this case
you want to edit the database that
pertains to the music player on your
phone so media in this case and then you
can go to the internal database or the
external it might be different for your
phone but on my phone is on the external
database I have to click on the internal
one it looks exactly like the external
one but there's no files in there so
I'll go ahead and open this up and
because we want to edit the album I'm
gonna click on the album so the ones
that say view you can't really edit
their view only the ones that don't are
the ones you could actually edit it so
albums is editable so I'll click albums
and you're gonna see all these weird
characters this is SQLite by the way
this is why you need that app go to the
very bottom because I
added this so see right there that album
from the song I want to edit that and
put the correct one in so zoom out all
right you're gonna see a four boxes the
one that you wanna edit is of course the
album name so I'm just going to go ahead
and delete that one out and the album is
called straight from the vault so type
that in sorry I can't really type fast
with the stylus but straight from the
vault hit save and the says record
updated and hit back now while I'm in
here I'll show you how to do the artists
if you want to edit that same thing it's
cool to the very bottom if you just
added artists and you could edit it
right here same way you hit edit record
and right there so there's four boxes
again and then if you want to edit the
genre or anything like that you just go
to audio maeda right here if you can see
that so audio Maeda
you just click on that right there and
this actually gives you the most options
to edit the file so all those to the
very bottom and edit the the folder or
the song that we're working on so edit
record and you can see with this one you
have quite a few boxes got a display
name that you get at it the title the
artist ID album let's look at let's see
so nothing really to edit here so I'll
just hit save now but music and let's
see if it better did
there you go all right this is David
