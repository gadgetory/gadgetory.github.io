and in this video we'll show you how to
text Google to get certain answers for
your questions such as you whether show
times etc now you may be thinking why
would I text Google instead of just
making a search and you know it's true
if you have a smartphone with a data
plan but sometimes people don't have
smartphones sometimes they don't have
data plans or sometimes you just might
not have data reception or connection so
being able to text school can actually
be quite handy so I'd recommend you know
whether or not you have a smart phone to
record this phone number into your
address book which is four six six four
five three and basically that spells out
Google if you were to be on a dial pad
so as you can see already I have it in
my phone book I'm just gonna tap on it
and I'll show you a little bit on how it
works so let's say I wanted show times
for movies I could type in showtimes and
then type in my zip code or city so I'm
just going to do my zip code so nine two
six five three and just hit Send when
he'd send it automatically sends it to
the Google servers which a computer will
automatically send you a response for
what you're looking for so as you can
see I have the show times or I'm sorry
the movies that are playing right over
here now if I wanted a certain movie for
example I wanted to watch The Avengers I
could text whatever number is next to it
to get these show times for the movie so
say I wanted the Avengers and 3d I'll
just text three back to Google and it'll
know I'm talking about the Avengers in
3d so now we'll just wait on the
response there you go so the Avengers in
3d and then you have to say which movie
theater do you wanna wash it in so we
will click on the second one or we'll
want the second one so I'll send two and
then finally we'll get these showtimes
obviously it's not the fastest way of
getting information you know it is kind
of going around the long way instead of
just making a quick google search but
you know if you're desperate
without a data connection or if you just
don't have a smart phone with the data
plan it might be your best option
so before I you know leave I'll just
do
few more examples there's some that are
much more straightforward than that like
weather I mean it's not that bad so I'll
type in weather really quick so weather
and then I'll just do a vine California
slow just to show you that you could
type in different you don't have to type
in the zip code so every wine california
send it and there you go so i got the
weather so that's actually useful it's
pretty quick so it's actually not that
bad I got my weather for today and a
little bit of a forecast for later on
this week there's a whole bunch of
different examples and if you go to the
link in the description you'll find more
examples of it now before Leo destroyed
last one which is directions so I'm an
Irvine so I'll just type in Irvine
California to Las Vegas let's say I
wanted to go to Las Vegas and a trip
actually isn't all that bad
so I was hit Las Vegas gets sent and it
actually send me directions from where
vine to Las Vegas so there you go there
are my directions now at the very top
left you can see this is one of six that
means there's only six messages in total
giving you the directions and you know
iPhone just going to be going on and on
for a while but anyway that's it for me
in this video if you want the number
