you know what time it is time to test
the durability of the Moto X or the
Motorola X to see just how much abuse
this phone can take before and actually
cracks so as always we're doing a couple
of tests here first one's going to be
the key scratch test which gives you an
indication as far as how well the phone
will fare being put in the same popular
purses your keys second test can be a
lot more extreme which as the knife test
obviously this one isn't as realistic
but it does give you a really good
indication as far as how scratch
resistant opponents especially along the
edges in the back of the case and third
and finally I'm doing the hammer or the
mallet slam test which tells you how
much pressure the phone could handle so
for example the phone was in the back of
your pocket you sat on it or if you
accidentally stepped on it it'll tell
you whether or not the phone is gonna be
able to handle that so with that said
let's go ahead and start so we'll do the
least extreme out of the three tests
first which is going to be the key
scratch test so I'll go ahead and turn
the display off for this that way we can
kind of see any kind of scratch marks so
I'll go ahead and start rubbing away now
this is Gorilla Glass so it should be
able to handle to handle this pretty
well go ahead and scratch it out I am
applying a good amount of pressure here
and we'll go ahead and wipe the screen
really quick take a look and I don't see
anything not even little scratches which
it's pretty expected nowadays I mean
I've done this test a whole bunch of
time with a bunch of phones and Gorilla
Glass does really well so what's more
interesting at least to me when it comes
to the key test is how the back case is
going to handle so it doesn't sound too
good and I'm seeing some markings and
let's see the damage so you see it
almost is like peeling off a little bit
right here and well I'm able to brush it
off which is nice but I'm thinking I
think that's a protective layer there
you could see some markings there I
might be able to rub that out anyways
you can see did okay I'm not the
greatest that I've seen I could see some
markings there but no real visible
damage when you look at it you know
straight on so we'll go ahead and test
finally the sides so just kind of
scratch whoops wrong
I'd scratch away at the sides here okay
so I'm seeing some markings there ah see
if we can't get that on camera yeah I
can see the scratches actually so I'm
not sure if that's coming through on
camera but there are some very light
scratch marks that definitely you know
took a toll on the size of the phone but
again it's not visible when looking at
it so I will go ahead and do the knife
test first thing we'll start off with is
going to be the screen go ahead and
clean it off so that we get a fresh
screen to work with all right so go
ahead and just start chopping away and
again this is Gorilla Glass the most
part it does pretty well against this so
let's go ahead and see how it looks and
again very very little markings at all I
don't see anything with my eye and I'm
sure on camera nothing's showing up I'll
go ahead and wipe it off I mean there
really isn't anything to wipe but yeah
so pretty good let's go ahead and do the
back so this can be the scariest part of
this test because did I do that well
against keys go ahead and try it alright
so again way more scuff marks you can
actually see them right over there
and uh definitely I could feel them but
again it's actually you know it is
pretty visible when you look at it right
there so you can see all those slashes
going across the phone so let's go ahead
and do the side so this is typically the
most challenging part for the aluminum
phones because they're chamfered edges
or chamfered edges but go ahead and
subtract away all right and oh yeah
definitely see the slash marks through
the casing on the side you know it
doesn't do it poorly as the chamfered
edges like on the iPhone or the HTC One
just because it's not as visible but
definitely scratches relatively easily I
mean you can see the plastic being cut
through again the benefit is it's not
visible you know if you just look at it
from here you're not gonna be able to
see it so if you do
you drop your phone from a foot or two
might not be the worst thing in the
world you might have to wipe off any
residue but seems pretty good I will go
ahead and now go to the granddaddy of
them all the pressure test which is
slamming this thing with this thing so
let's go ahead and start all right so
three drops did pretty well screen still
working that's pretty expected I'm going
to start applying a good amount of
pressure now slamming it down alright so
you can hear how hard I'm hitting that
thing we saw a little bit of
discoloration there in the screen in
fact it's still there let's see if we
lose something you can see it's still
there so I mean you know what yeah so
you can see this screen hasn't recovered
a hundred percent yet from those
markings there go and see if I can wipe
that off I mean I don't think it stopped
letting is actually the LCD or the
display itself shorted AMOLED display so
yeah uh not the best result again that
I've seen we'll go ahead and try the
back now so do the back and see how
handles it handles that we see some
transfer from the mallet some residue
probably wipe that off maybe with some
water or moisture but screen is still
working so that's the good news
uh that discoloration you know I was
talking about I'm not sure if it's even
showing up you know 100% but so yeah you
can see it right there right there you
can see one of the white background it
it's just a little bit you know
sometimes it takes a while so we'll see
throughout the rest of this test that
handles or if that fixes itself but for
the final test here we're going to test
the side bezels because this one has
extremely thin side bezel so if you're
to drop on the side this kind of gives
you an idea as far as how it'll do so
let's go ahead and try it
all right I think that's enough abuse
for one day um
they pretty well I mean is able to
handle the hits and the impact on the
sides so yeah I mean that's pretty much
it for this video you guys can see I'm
in the back I mean okay I'll tell you
the truth it wasn't the best durability
test that I've seen I've seen better
from different phones like the iPhone 5
the Lumia 920 especially but you know
for the most part thankfully it isn't
that visible as far as the scratches go
in the back
but they're definitely there the size
took a pretty big toll from the knife
and the screen still you know has a
little bit of discoloration they're
going but you know you know what go
ahead and follow me on Twitter and I'll
let you guys know when or if the screen
actually resolves or the issue gets
fixed but anyways that's pretty much it
for me in this video if you liked it
please give it a thumbs up and subscribe
to the channel for more mobile
technology videos just like this thank
