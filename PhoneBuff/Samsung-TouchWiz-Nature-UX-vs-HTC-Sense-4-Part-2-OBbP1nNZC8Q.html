category is the keyboard so we'll go
ahead and open up colornote really quick
so cancel on this open up colornote will
do test note and pretty much the only
advantage on the TouchWiz UI here is the
keyboard gives you the option to have
handwriting input so if i wanted to
write with my like you know like a wood
on a piece of paper i right hi and it'll
get if i want to delete i can just tap
back like that so pretty cool kind of
like that it is on the galaxy note but
it's pretty much it honestly I don't
really like the keyboard on here I've
talked about that in the review of the
galaxy s3 just not the actor i mean if i
were to type something like i don't know
let's say uh house whoops ohci messed up
there but the sidemen house and let's
say that's not what i wanted right i hit
space but I decide that's not what I
wanted I go back and if I wanted to make
it porn if i type in RN um Eve for
example I notice on its Bellhorn but how
to get my point across you can see that
it tries to give me a different word
we're on since it doesn't do that so
anyway we'll go ahead and talk about the
advantages of sense and the keyboard
here actually really like it because one
you have the ability to do swipe but
that's also on the arse you know slide
your your finger cross to make words but
that's also on TouchWiz but the main
thing that I like is that the
autocorrect is much better so we'll do
the same thing will type in house and
then hit space and then back out of it
and that this time you can see if I
wanted to type warned it would give me
different suggestions based off of what
i'm typing instead of thinking I'm
starting another word so it's a lot
smarter in that regard another thing is
when you're editing text so this is
right text really quick you actually
have this little magnifying glass which
makes it a little bit easier to select
you know what you want on the phone and
then the last thing is that you have
these little directional arrows so for
example if I don't want to use that
magnifying glass I can just tap this
little directional arrow to the left to
kind of move my cursor right and left or
up and down which does make you know
text editing a lot easier with the sense
UI so anyway the obvious win here goes
two cents I'm definitely like the
keyboard better on this guy and the
official score
now after that is 44 touchwiz and 34
cents let's go ahead and go over the
extra features that come on each device
alright so I know this video is getting
kind of long and it's about to get
longer because both these you is have a
whole bunch of extra features will start
with touch with so the first thing is
motion controls I'm not going to go in
depth about it but basically you have a
whole bunch of extra features i did a
separate review on this on the channel
so you guys want to learn more check
that out let's throw you a few like
smart alert i'm smart alert basically uh
or not I'm sorry smart stay smart stay
lets you use the front-facing camera to
detect your eyes when you look in the
screen and it won't turn off if you're
actually looking at it even if the
standby time is like 30 seconds so if
you're looking at for a minute reading
article it'll detect a reading it and it
won't turn it off so really smart other
things like taking a swiping your palm
across screen to take a screen capture
like that pretty cool little features
but anyway so i'll talk about that you
have the power saving future which
pretty much under cloths the processor
to like one gigger instead of 1.5
gigahertz which does save you a lot of
battery it's a great way to save battery
another thing is voice and face lock
again i did a step review on the channel
but i'll show you really quick it adds
on to ice cream sandwiches face unlock
it adds voice recognition into the mix
which does make it a little bit more
secure so that's pretty cool another
thing is you can see up here at the top
i enabled my battery percentage so
really easy to see how much battery you
have left and start trying to guess
based off that little icon and last
thing is you have the LED indicator not
really that big of a deal but you have
the option to you know if you don't want
it to for example turn on when you're
charging the LED right over here you
could uncheck that guy and you know
customize it a little bit so gives you a
little bit more control over what you
could do we'll go ahead and talk about
the advantages of sense now and first
thing is that you go to the personalized
tab and you'll see pretty much all the
advantages one is your scenes and skins
the scenes let you change you know
pretty much everything on your home
screen so for example right now i'm on
the work scene which has a lot of you
know widgets and shortcuts that are
related to work but if i wanted to go to
social it'll give me widgets that are
related to facebook twitter etc of
course i have those things installed but
you see that
the people who write over here i have my
texting over here and french stream
which integrates all your social media
into one little feed which is pretty
cool right over here so you can see how
you can just change it on the fly that
pretty cool skins let you customize the
look of your phone so you want to change
the colors of the layouts and stuff you
could do that you have fastboot so it's
under power and I fastboot basically
what it does is you know what the name
says it makes your phone boot up a lot
faster I'll say maybe four to five times
faster I did a separate video again on
the channel you guys want to check that
out I'm a few other things I want to go
over really quick as APIs OCA shins
basically you know if you have two
browsers it's an awesome way to be able
to just to make one to default over the
other instead of having to go to the
settings are throughout each application
settings so pretty cool way of managing
your phone there another option that you
have is memory cleaning you go into
storage you hit make more space and
it'll clear out the cache of some of
your apps that you don't necessarily
need so pretty cool little feature there
the browser has you know a read mode
world take out all the ads and things
like that make it a lot easier to read
an article and of course has Beats Audio
you know in the software which optimizes
your sound experience so overall I mean
it's really really close um you know I'd
say it's almost a tie but if I have to
give a slight edge to somebody it BR 2 1
UI it betta touch was mainly because you
know the the power saving feature the
smart stay future and things like
battery percentage really make you know
more of a difference to me at least I
know that some of you guys it might not
be the same but the smartest a peter is
awesome view reading articles and you
know with a base screen like this you're
going to be doing that a lot more than
you think and things like power saver
really do help save battery and you know
apps on the market can't necessarily do
that you'd have to root your phone under
clock at things like that but that's why
I give the win here but like i said it's
really close barely a win for TouchWiz
next thing I'll talk about is appearance
this one's a pretty easy one for me to
give it to sense overall it just looks
better i mean take one look at the
settings and you could pretty much tell
that HTC took a little bit more time
refining their user interface i mean it
looks a lot cleaner this
it looks like it did you know I in
Gingerbread and now we're on ICS looks
pretty much the same you have that
little blue glow at the bottom where on
HTC sense you know you go like this and
it kind of separates the tabs based off
where my finger is so cool effect but
it's not just that pretty much anywhere
you go you have cool little transitions
like for example the world clock you
have a full-on globe we're on this guy
you go to the world clock and you have
nothing but you know just a boring old
clock like that so you can see the
difference here you know I could go
around and I gizumon just a lot more
graphically no appealing I don't know
how to say that but anyway that's that
you have this little cube animation
effect that pretty much is everywhere
throughout the phone so you can go like
from tablet app like this which does
make it look pretty cool that same 3d
cube effect is on the home screen as you
guys can see right here kind of has this
little cube effect go to the phone
application and same thing you have the
cubes pretty much anywhere you go
another thing but the appearance is the
applications themselves look better like
for example the voice recorder on here
so if I go to voice recorder where is it
there it is um it just looks really
really nice you know this little
microphone here and as I'm talking it
detects you know my voice like that so
really cool you know animations overall
just looks a little bit cleaner that's
that the wind goes to sense again so
that now the official scorer is by for
TouchWiz and four cents and the last
thing I'm gonna talk about is
ease-of-use not necessarily like you
know ease of usable OS because the both
androids both running ice cream sandwich
in this case but what I'm talking about
is you know one-handed use and though
the TouchWiz UI does give you this
advantage right here which I talked
about earlier which I lets you go from
home screen to home screen like this
which does make it easier for one hand
overall I feel like it's a little bit
easier on sense because for example on
the phone application everything I need
as far as my tabs go or right over here
at the bottom so makes it a lot easier
to refresh with these big screens
instead of having to reach to the top
which is what you have to do with
TouchWiz you have to go all the way to
the top and it's kind of hard to do with
you know screens that are 4.7 4.8 inches
large so anyway that's I advantage for
touch
r I'm sorry for sense so overall the
score is 525 hate to do that to you guys
but I mean I really feel like you know
the the two you guys are really really
close obviously one's going to appeal to
you compared to the other to me I mean
they're pretty equal I do like the way
sense looks a lot i wish that you know
Samsung will do a better job making it
look a little bit more refined like if
she does but you know I don't know for
one thing that I like on HTC I like you
know another thing on set on samsung's
touchwiz so it's really a personal you
know preference type of thing but
hopefully this gives you a better ideas
for switch user interface is better for
