and like the title appear says i'll be
giving away a fifty-dollar amazon.com
giftcard doing this for two reasons 1i
want to celebrate you guys my YouTube
subscribers because I really appreciate
everything the last one of you guys
there's over 30 scribers to the YouTube
channel and hope you get that number to
grow and to I once suffered the fact
that of them pretty much every how-to
video I can think of are least most out
the videos I can think of by the way if
you guys know of any how-to videos I
haven't done already please let me know
because I really want to become the
internet resource for all you know how
to videos on smartphones anyways the
channels will be taking a slight shift
focus obviously probably don't even
recognize me because I'm usually behind
the scenes probably recognize my finger
if I can show you that that freckle
because I'll show you what to do on the
bone anyways I want to celebrate the
ship to focus be doing more videos like
this I'm so to be doing the how to's
whenever I think about some be doing
reviews and comparisons like I've done
in the past but this can be doing more
videos where you know I'm over here
hopefully that's a good thing anyways I
want to celebrate want to give this guy
away Isaac see I haven't scratched off
the code just yet that's because winter
has been selected as soon as the winner
selected I'll scratch sky off and email
the code hopefully the winner is you on
the way to enter is go to phone book
calm and the link below and it takes you
to the page where you could actually
enter a form all you gotta do is like us
on Facebook and also subscribe to the
YouTube fan on why I pointed up for
facebook but anyway subscribe to the
YouTube channel and like phone book calm
on facebook make sure you use that form
below because every time you hit the
doing button you have a login on
facebook in the form and then I do it
for facebook and hit do it on youtube so
that way you get credit I gives you five
points if you want some extra points you
can leave a comment to this video or on
public rock homes is an actual post and
also you like fumble comms Twitter but
