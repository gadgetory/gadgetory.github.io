why they choose to use an Android phone
instead of using an iPhone at some point
or another you're going to hear the word
customization now customization means a
lot of different things to a lot of
different people and that's kind of the
point right
everyone customizes their phones a
little bit differently unless they have
an iPhone at which point everyone's
phone looks pretty much the same kidding
but like not really so today I wanted to
show you guys how I customize my Android
phone to give you non Android users an
idea of what Android customization could
look like and maybe give you enthusiasts
some fresh new ideas you might want to
integrate into your own setup now my
main philosophy when customizing my
phone is all about maximizing efficiency
I want to be able to get to what I want
quickly I don't want to have to swipe
around screens wasting time going back
and forth looking for an app and when
possible I want my phone to predict what
I want before I even want it which if
you think about it all combined to make
your phone experience faster like
obviously the phone itself doesn't get
faster but these customizations let you
use your phone faster if that makes any
sense anyways the first thing we'll take
a look at is the home screen I'm using a
custom launcher and nova launcher which
lets you take your customization game to
the next level I've got my most commonly
used apps and folders in my main stream
and if you notice I have custom icons
for each and every app with an icon pack
called materialistic I've been using
this icon pack for years now and I just
love the look of it especially when it
comes to the folder icons which makes
things look a lot more like a desktop
computer than just your ordinary phone I
also have a few widgets installed up top
of the weather widget I customized using
HD widgets and on both the left and the
right home screens I have separate check
lists using an app called to do is which
is really nice because you can check
things off right then and there without
having to launch the app itself to match
my three home screens I have three dot
pages at the bottom so the main one is
for commonly use that the one on the
left is for quickly controlling my
Philips hue lights and my bedrooms and
the one on the right is for setting
shortcuts like battery storage and a
toggle for a quickly maxing out the
screen time out on my display I also
have a bunch of gestures that I can use
on the home screen
that let me launch apps quickly and I've
set them up in a way that they're easy
to remember because if you don't end up
remembering the gestures and there's
like really no point of having them so a
double tap on the home screen toggles my
flashlight a pinch in launches a
magnifier letting me zoom in in real
life a pinch out toggle is an app called
darker that actually lets you bring your
screen brightness down way below factory
levels which protip is really useful for
when you want to check your phone in the
middle of the night and you don't want
the phone to blind you it's wiped down
opens the notification bar without
having to reach all the way up to the
top and a swipe up launches the app
drawer just like on the pixel launcher
which also makes room for one more app
to quickly access on the dock a two
finger swipe up launches Google home for
what I want to push my entire screen
onto a chromecast enabled TV and a two
finger swipe down opens quick toggles
where I actually have custom toggles
installed for things like seeing what's
on my clipboard and a shortcut to add
reminders using an app called tiles a
tap and swipe up jumps directly into the
nearby traffic menu within Google Maps
or when I want to get up and go and a
tap and swipe down launches an app
called hydro coach which quickly lets me
keep track of how much water I down in a
day when it comes to my app drawer I
have a few folders in the top row and I
never let the drawers go beyond just one
page this is partly due to my OCD we're
having an uneven amount of icons on my
home screen will like just kill me and
it's partly because I don't want to have
to swipe between multiple screens which
tends to make apps a little bit harder
to find now if you notice and if the
apps are either on the home screen have
a dedicated widget or show up in the
notification bar don't show up here in
the app drawer I have these apps hidden
because not only does it help keep
things looking clean but by only
accessing an app and only one way every
single time I use it it keeps that
method of accessing it fresh in my
memory ultimately cutting down on the
amount of time it takes me to find it
later up in this status bar by unlocking
the system UI tuner in the settings i
disabled the icon for Bluetooth and the
alarm from even showing up since I
always keep those on anyways and didn't
really tell me anything I don't already
know
unlike the Wi-Fi icon which I also
always keep on but at least the Wi-Fi
icon tells me how strong the signal is
and since that Android still somehow
doesn't have a good battery percentage
indicator with the one that you can
enable in the system tuner being really
to see I'm a thin battery bar going
across the top of my phone using an app
called energy bar that lets me know what
my battery level is on a scale of 0 to
100 last customization I had up in the
status bar is an icon I added for screen
rotation which tells you whether or not
portrait lock is enabled but while
having a portrait lock icon there is
nice for the most part I don't even have
to worry about it since I actually
programmed my phone to enable and
disable poor Sherlock automatically
using an app called Tasker I haven't
said so Porsche log gets automatically
enabled other times that there's a
chance that I'll be using my phone in
bed which is like really the only time I
ever need Porsche lock enabled otherwise
during the rest of the day the phone
automatically goes back to auto-rotate I
also use Tasker to automatically launch
the audible app when my phone connects
to the Bluetooth in my car and
automatically launch my music app when I
connect my headphones all these little
automation save me the time from having
to open the apps or like take the action
that is going to take anyways again
making my phone experience a little
faster a cool little customization I
have for the music app is a visualizer
that shows up in the navigation bar at
the bottom it works whether I'm on the
music app itself or almost any other
screen using an app called nav bar which
is available for phones using Android
nougat and above speaking of music with
an app called button mapper I customize
the volume buttons on my phone so that a
double press of the volume down keys
both mutes and unmute the media volume
specifically this is nice for those
situations where you want to make sure
that your phone doesn't make a sound
before you open up your next app or game
where a regular volume press only adjust
the ringer volume unless some sort of
media is already playing another hard
right to VI have takes full advantage of
the phone's LED notification light using
an app called light manager I have
different colors flash for notifications
from different apps so for facebook
notifications the LED flashes blue it
flashes yellow for snapchat cyan for
Twitter
Green for missed calls and text messages
and red for when I either have really
low battery or when I have no cell
signal which all combined save me time
by not having to actually check my phone
for the notifications that I otherwise
don't really care about and then finally
the most textbook customization for
anybody who cares about speed is
changing the animation times in the
developer settings which I personally
like to set at half the stock animation
speed but other than that that's pretty
much
the gist of how I customized all my
Android phones like I said before my
main philosophy when it comes to
customizing my poem is to maximize its
efficiency and to be honest even though
I don't always use the fastest
smartphone in the world I feel like all
these little efficiencies combined kind
of make up for the difference at least
somewhat now everything I've showed you
here can be done without rooting your
phone or anything like that and I'll be
linking every app I talked about down
below in the description anyways that is
it for me in this video give it a thumbs
up if you liked it thank you guys for
watching and as always I'll see you in
the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
