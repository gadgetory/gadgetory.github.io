bluff calm in this video we're doing a
review on the atom with three colonel by
roman be beyond xda-developers
i put the link to the SDA thread in the
description box below I'm running this
colonel with the free gs3 wrong by team
sonic I also did a review on that ROM on
the channel you guys want to check it
out so anyway that's the Raman running
with this kernel I'm gonna be doing a
few benchmarks against could see the
performance you're gonna get with this
so far for me everything's been running
pretty smoothly I want to open up setcpu
so you guys could see the clock speed I
have it running at 1809 set on boot you
can push it up to 1890 but according to
thread the developer recommends 800
saying everything runs pretty smooth but
I was gonna go ahead and leave it at
that and run the benchmarks so I've done
benchmarks on the phone before one of
the stock and also with the free gs3
ramen pretty much I got the same score
so I want to compare them to those
scores with this new kernel I'll go
ahead and start with the intent to
benchmark and I'll just run the
benchmark and let you guys see the score
so I test and start test and I'll skip
to the score all right so it scored a 70
to 59 on the intent to benchmark so
before actually got a 68 49 I believe or
48 so it's about 400 points higher which
is pretty good obviously with that
different kernel so that's the 300
megahertz overclock let's go ahead and
run the next benchmark and it just like
you guys know I did do a fresh reboot
before I started this video so we'll go
to we'll do a limb pack really quick and
see what we get here so let's go ahead
and hit run and it got 201 run it again
172 this time 179 200 so you can see
it's getting around 200 or between 170
and 200 so let say on average like 185
which is a definite improvement because
I got I think I got around 172 last time
so a definite improvement here let's go
ahead and go to the next test which is
the quadrant standard
benchmark so quadrant standard and again
I'll just skip to the result so you guys
will have to look at the whole process
all right so the quadrant benchmark test
is done and go ahead and look at the
score so I got a fifty to forty five and
before I got I believe it was like a
forty nine hundred so a three hundred
point improvement now on quadrant I ran
this test you know a couple of times
before I even do this video and I got
like fifty five hundred obviously it's
gonna fluctuate so take it for what it's
worth but it is definitely like three or
four hundred points higher which is
definitely something significant we'll
go ahead and go to the last benchmark
which will be a meta mark now this one's
gonna be pretty much capped at 60 frames
per second I think I'm gonna run it you
can see the last benchmark I ran was
that my best is fifty nine point nine so
that was well with this kernel where
before I got like fifty nine point eight
or fifty nine point seven so not much of
a difference because of the vsync but
there's take that into consideration but
anyway that's pretty much it for the
benchmarks overall so far it's been you
know so far so good everything runs
smoothly I haven't had any real issues
with the ROM running at eighteen hundred
it does get kind of warm as far as the
battery and stuff but pretty good I
haven't really you know used it long
enough to really see a difference in
battery life I am using this CPU sleeper
so when the screen is off it does save
more better life which came with the
free gs3 rom but anyways so far I like
it you know I feel like the browsing
experience is better I mean obviously
gonna get that when you increase the
clock speed but that's it for me in the
review of the atom of three kernel
check out the XDA thread if you want to
learn more I know that the developers
coming out with a new or newer newer
versions as it goes along and as he
develops further but anyway except for
me in this video thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
