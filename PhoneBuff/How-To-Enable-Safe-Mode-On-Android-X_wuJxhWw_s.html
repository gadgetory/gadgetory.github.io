bluff calm and in this video I'm gonna
show you how to enable safe mode on your
Android phone so the way you do it is
first you have to turn your device off
so I'll go ahead and power off my device
notice that I had widgets and shortcuts
on my home screen those things will
actually not be enabled when I do boot
in stay put because safe mode disables
all third-party applications to help you
troubleshoot when your device is having
problems like persistent forest closes
so anyway the way you boot into safe
mode is first power up your device with
the power button like you normally would
I'm just gonna wait until I see a screen
flash up and then I'm gonna press and
hold the volume up and volume down
button simultaneously so I'm not
pressing anything else I'm just holding
on these guys rather be here I'm gonna
let my phone do its thing as far as
loading up the OS and as soon as it's
done loading you'll see that it is
indeed in safe mode alright so you can
see at the very bottom left it actually
has a little piece of text that says
safe mode which obviously means I'm in
safe mode I'll go ahead and unlock my
screen you can see my widget is gone my
application shortcuts are gone I go into
my apps list and I'm gonna have two
pages and I can show you that I do have
more but obviously the ones that are
disabled and the ones that are not
showing up are third-party applications
that you know is pretty much not
essential to Android running on your
phone and this is what really helps you
troubleshoot to get out of safe mode all
you have to do is press and hold power
and then tap restart so if some of you
guys done it by accident that's how you
get rid of it just restart your phone
and it should do the trick while that's
restarting I'll show you how to boot in
safe mode on Android 4.1 jelly bean
because that was just demonstrated on
Ice Cream Sandwich and before this guy
is obviously running jogging my Galaxy
Nexus and the way you do it on jelly
bean is actually a lot easier so when
the device is on press and hold the
power button and all you have to do is
instead of
hitting power off press and hold power
off and then you can see that's reboot
to safe mode says do you want to reboot
in safe mode this will Dave will disable
all third-party applications you have
installed they will restore once again
once you reboot I'm gonna hit okay it's
gonna shut down and it's automatically
gonna boot into safe mode which is what
I want I'm gonna go back to my galaxy s3
and you can see the safe mode text is no
longer there I'll unlock and you can see
my shortcuts are back all my shortcuts
on this screen are back and you go to my
application launcher and I have more
than those two pages of apps that no
previous is wrong because all my
third-party apps at Google Chrome
even though have to Google app dead
trigger asphalt's for my games all that
stuff is back so everything is all good
again with my phone but anyway that's
pretty much it from me in this video if
