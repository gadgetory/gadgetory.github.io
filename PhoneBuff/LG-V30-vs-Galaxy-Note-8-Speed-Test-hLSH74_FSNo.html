have an interesting speed test between
the LGV 30 and the Galaxy Note 8 because
you know our first glance when you take
a look at the spec sheets the note 8
seems to have the edge it has the same
exact processor as the V 30 but it comes
with an extra 2 gigabytes of RAM but the
thing is LG has always done a pretty
good job at optimizing their phone
software not to mention that the
Snapdragon 835 in the V 30 is actually
clocked at a higher frequency than it is
on the notes aids so the question is are
the V 30 software optimizations and it's
higher clocked processor enough to
overcome the 6 gigabytes of RAM on the
note 8 let's find out
this episode is brought to you by guns
of boom guns of boom is one of the best
mobile shooters out there it's super
easy to play and it's like having a real
first-person shooter game from a PC
right on your phone the game is fast
paced with non-stop action and I just
love the look of the graphics in
gameplay you can customize your
character to match your style you can
upgrade your guns and weapons and if
you're good enough you could dominate
your opponents online guns of boom is
available for free on both iOS and
Android so click on that link down below
in the description and start playing
today ok we'll begin by starting the
stopwatches on each phone and then jump
right into the first row of system apps
where the Galaxy Note 8 was able to snap
that selfie at a faster rate pushing it
ahead with it already moving on to the
second row but the V 30 hasn't fallen
too far behind with its fast animations
allowing it to plow through Instagram
and snapchat with it joining the note 8
in Photoshop however it does seem to be
struggling a bit allowing the note 8 to
increase this lead as it begins working
on laps it's where we've actually
increased the length of the clip being
time-lapse tear from 24 frames up to 72
frames long which should help us better
distinguish the RAW processing power on
these phones where in theory the V 30
should have the advantage with its
higher clock speed but for whatever
reason it seems to be the opposite with
the V 30 processing the time-lapse at a
significantly slower rate which only
adds on to the note eights lead with it
now being a full app ahead as it works
on flip diving while the V 30 is still
trying its best to catch up in subway
surfers and a little bit of good news
for the V 30 as it seems to complete
subway surfers at a faster rate allowing
it to shrink the gap between it in a
note 8 but the bad news is it seems like
it's loading flip diving at a slower
rate meaning the note aids one app lead
still remains fully intact with it
actually looking to improve on it as it
starts working on below force would be
30 doing itself no favors loading fit
the fat slower as well allowing the
notates 1 a plea to turn into a 2 a
plead with it flying through Spotify and
moving on to ESPN while the p30 only
just started working on bulla force so
the note 8 is beginning to run away with
it here in the first lab with the
finishing up with Netflix and moving on
to the last leg in loading both the
mobile and full versions of the Amazon
Web site which the note 8 does so
without any hiccups allowing it to
finish the first lap with the time of 1
minute and 36 seconds and unfortunately
for the V 30 things don't look like
they're getting any better with it
loading bullet force Spotify and ESPN at
a slower rate so at this point the note
8 is just looking to embarrass the V 30
with it keeping all the app so far open
and ready to go in the background with
the V 30 taking a full 21 seconds longer
to finish the first flap clocking at a
time of 1 minute and 57 which is only 9
seconds quicker than the 2 minutes and 5
seconds took the note aides to complete
both laps so a dominant performance from
the Galaxy Note 8 and honestly a
disappointing one from the V 30 with it
failing to keep Netflix ESPN and even
Spotify open and ready to go but
surprisingly the feed 30 somehow manages
to keep bullet force open as it does fit
the fat so clearly LG software is
optimizing for the more heavy-duty apps
with it keeping all four games ready to
go in the background but unfortunately
the optimizations alone aren't enough
with the 4 gigabytes of RAM failing to
keep Photoshop open so we'll go ahead
and fast forward to be 30 to the finish
line where it kept most of the remaining
apps open except for the calendar with
the finally completing the test with a
time of 2 minutes and 55 seconds making
the winner by a huge margin the galaxy
notes
8 ok so here the individual app load of
times from the first lap where you can
see that outside of Instagram and subway
surfers the note 8 loaded all the apps
significantly faster than the V 30
anyways that is it for me in this video
thank you guys for watching and
as always I'll see you in the very next
episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
