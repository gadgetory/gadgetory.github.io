buff and europe the year myself and many
others in the tech community look
forward to the next version of Samsung's
Galaxy Note probably more so than any
other Android smartphone out there and
it isn't because of the design or the
build quality of the note it isn't
because of the software and it certainly
isn't because of the price but instead
it's the cutting-edge specs that Samsung
delivers with each new iteration of the
note that gets us all excited now when
you look at the spec sheet on the note 3
you'll see that even months after has
been released it's still one of the
highest end android smartphones out
there with a 5.7 inch Super AMOLED HD
screen two point three gigahertz time
dragon 800 processor not two but three
gigabytes of RAM a 13 megapixel camera
capable of 4k video recording USB 3.1
not to mention a huge 3200 milliamp
battery there's really not much to
dislike about the note 3 at least from a
hardware perspective but that's the
thing about it there's so much more that
goes into the ultimate experience that
you get from a phone than just hard
brand and some of those areas depending
on what you're looking for in a phone
the note 3 could have some serious
drawbacks for one the note 3 just like
all the predecessors before it is a big
phone and for some people it could be
too big to the point that it isn't easy
for them to use with one hand or even
worse it doesn't even fit in their
pockets another potential drawback again
depending on what you're looking for in
a phone is the plasticky build the note
3 that samsung phones are pretty much
known for nowadays and then finally the
last thing i could think of that is a
potential drawback that it was the first
thing that came to mind is the software
that samsung will to answer their phones
in touch with now for those of you who
watched the living with the note 2 video
that i did last year you might recall
that the drawbacks that i talked about
in that video in regards to the note 2
or the very same drawbacks that i just
mentioned with the note 3 which while
disappointing isn't really all that
surprising because these drawbacks kind
of come with the territory i'm
and the note 3 wouldn't really be a
galaxy note without its large display
which could obviously cause the phone to
be too big for some people it wouldn't
have that removable back cover which
gives you the removable battery and the
expandable microSD card slot without the
plasticky build quality and then for
better or for worse it wouldn't quite be
a Samsung made flagship without TouchWiz
running the show but the good news is
the note 3 isn't just a note to with
better specs and while the two phones do
share some of the same drawbacks Salem
did a relatively good job at minimizing
these drawbacks on the note 3 so the
first hint of this could be seen in the
build quality and design now the note 3
is still very much a plastic phone but
Samsung has done a few things to make it
feel work at least look a little bit
more premium on the back you have a soft
touch leatherette material that while
still plastic adds a sense of luxuries
that found that I actually really like
wrapping around the phone is a
metallic-looking band whose ridges
resembled the pages of a notepad so
kudos to Samsung for sticking with the
notepad theme but just like the back
cover this metal looking band is still
made of plastic evidenced by the slight
dent that I have in my unit from a two
foot drop and then finally on the front
the bezels at least on this black
version have a brushed aluminum look
that combined with the back cover and
the side band gives the note 3 and
overall good look not necessarily great
but definitely a step up from the more
plasticky feeling note 2 and even be
more recent galaxy s4 but the build
quality and design isn't anywhere near
as big of a deal breaker for the note
series as is the sheer size of these
phones so it was important that with the
note 3 Samsung tried their best to
minimize this drawback now until Samsung
figures out a way to make a flexible
phone that can just be folded up and put
in your pocket the notes large physical
size is here to stay for the foreseeable
future again this may or may not be an
issue depending on who you are but for
my girlfriend for example the note 3
size is just too big I mean she
absolutely loves the phone but it
doesn't fit in most of her pampa
and I don't think she'd be willing to
change her whole wardrobe just to
accommodate for a phone I on the other
hand standing just over six feet tall
don't have too many issues with the size
of the phone other than the fact that it
doesn't fit in my car's cup holder where
I typically like to leave my phone when
I'm driving so the physical size of the
phone can still be a problem but with
some touch-optimized wizardry from
Samsung the virtual says the phone
doesn't really have to be thanks to the
high-end specs that we were talking
about earlier with its powerful cpu and
GPU the note 3 screen can be rescaled on
the fly to anywhere between 3.5 and 4.5
inches diagonally making the phone a lot
easier to use with one hand and while I
don't use this feature as much as sound
with smaller hands probably would in
those times that I only have one hand
available like when I'm holding
groceries or if I'm walking my dog
having the ability to resize the screen
with a simple swipe in and out from the
edge of the phone is a really nice thing
to have and I think it definitely
minimizes the issue of poor one-handed
use now the screen rescaling feature is
a software feature that is built
straight into touch with and as many of
you guys know I tend to prefer the stock
Android experience over just about any
other third-party you I including
TouchWiz but yet when it comes to
TouchWiz on the Galaxy Note 3 I have a
little bit of a love-hate relationship
going on for example if I was to choose
between the TouchWiz edition of the
galaxy s4 vs the Play edition of the
galaxy s4 I'd go with the Play edition
nine maybe ten times out of ten but with
the Galaxy Note 3 if there were a play
edition of the note I'd go with it only
five or six times out of ten and that's
because while TouchWiz can still be
irritating bugging out a phone that
should have no performance issues
whatsoever it given the hardware it does
add some value like screen rescaling
that can make the overall experience of
the note better with TouchWiz then with
stock Android alone but screen rescaling
by itself wouldn't be enough it's also
the software suite that comes with one
of the biggest features of the galaxy
note that i'm surprised i haven't talked
about yet being several minutes into
this video in the s pen as soon as you
pulled the s pen
no you get a little pop-up window and
Air Command giving you quick and easy
access to some of the S pen's most
useful touchless features you also have
things like I spent keeper which
prevents you from walking off without
reattaching the S Pen and then finally
you have s no which in my opinion is the
best note-taking app available on any
mobile OS those features in combination
with some of the others that are
actually useful in touch with make
having TouchWiz on the note 3 not as
much of a drawback as it initially seems
of course like I said earlier TouchWiz
does seem to bog down the note 3 a bit
with my unit freezing and lagging from
time to time which is just inexcusable
given the hardware but hopefully Sampson
could address this issue with a software
update in the future so I've spent the
majority of this video talking about the
drawbacks on the note 3 and how Samsung
has minimized them in comparison to the
note 2 and I've done this because
outside of these three major drawbacks
the note 3 is kind of the complete
package you've got probably the best
display on any smartphone right now a
powerful quad-core processor with a
bunch of RAM a crisp and clear camera
that's capable of recording amazing 4k
video a battery that lasts even the
heaviest of users all day long and extra
features that you don't really see on
other phones like USB 3.0 a removable
battery and microSD card slot and IR
blaster and of course the S Pen so like
I said in the beginning if the drawbacks
that I mentioned earlier aren't a
deal-breaker for you then there really
isn't a whole lot to dislike about the
note 3 of course the new HTC One and
Galaxy s5 bored just around the corner
so it would be wise to wait and see what
those are all about before pulling the
trigger on the note 3 and you can bet
that there be some fumble of style
comparisons coming up between these
phones to help you make that final
decision but on that note that's pretty
much it for me in this video if you
liked it please give it a thumbs up it
really helps me in the channel out a
bunch and if you haven't already make

this thank you for watching and as
always I'll catch you guys in the very
