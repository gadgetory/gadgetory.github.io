this video we'll be showing you guys the
difference that two gigabytes makes on
your phone compared to one gigabyte on
the right I have the Samsung Galaxy s3
which obviously has two gigs on the Left
I have the HTC EVO 4G LTE which has one
gig why the reason why I'm comparing
these two phones is because they both
have HD screens so the resolution is the
same and also the both running the same
processor which is the Snapdragon s4 I
fresh-grated both of them and also
they're both on the same Wi-Fi network
I'm gonna run a couple of apps over here
as you can see on the screen and I'll be
jumping in and out of the task managers
on each phone so we could actually check
up on the RAM status so right now I'm
gonna go ahead and show you guys that
there's no recent apps running and we'll
go to the task manager really quick on
both devices so we see how much room is
or how much RAM is being used up on the
galaxy s3 522 megabytes is being used up
on the Evo 4G LTE only 466 megabytes of
RAM is being used up so a little bit
different but we'll go ahead and run the
test anyway you know can't really
control how much RAM is going to be used
up when the device first starts up so
anyway let's go ahead and start running
the applications so I'll do dictionary
go back and then we'll do Google Earth
you can see the speed is about the same
and you know that's expected considering
they're running the same processor and
we'll do the fourth app and at home now
let's go ahead and check in on our task
manager again so we'll go to task
manager on here task manager on here and
now it's using 575 megabytes 506
megabytes so using a little bit more RAM
now on both devices go ahead and
continuous go to Maps let's go to
messaging let's go to gallery let's go
to Gmail and again let's check on the
RAM so task manager and task manager
we're using 543 megabytes 635 megabytes
now let's go back and let's go to
Flixter let's go to score Center
WordPress and Chrome oops let's check in
on the task editors again so task
manager and task manager 755 megabytes
so you still have one point six two
gigabytes available or total so we have
you know about 900 or 800 megabytes left
on here reason 556 as you see the bar is
pretty close to full as there's only one
hundred 24 megabytes free so this next
test should start to make a difference
let's go ahead and load up YouTube's
calculator on each phone color note and
then the cameras okay so hopefully that
has a lot of apps running in the
background hopefully this will make a
difference let's go ahead and go to the
task manager again eight hundred five
megawatts being used now you see there's
five hundred sixteen megabytes being
used on the Evo there's one hundred
sixty four megabytes left so it kind of
gives you an idea actually probably
closed out one of these applications in
the background um let's see if we could
actually tell which application
I was closed out um I don't see the
camera running over here and a couple of
apps but anyway let's go ahead and do
the test now again running through all
the apps and see if there's going to be
a speed difference now considering that
we expect there to be more apps open up
on the galaxy s3 so again Dictionary
Earth so they're both kind of reloaded
earth but it was faster on the galaxy s3
file explorer gym rat so you can see
this one open it up again this one had
it open in the background let's go to
maps it's already open just want to
reload it let's go to messaging about
the same there gallery
Gmail so you can see now I mean it's
noticeably faster on the galaxy of
service a little bit faster to begin
with but um it just seems that it's a
little bit faster even than that so you
can see right here it didn't have the
low score center at all which I believe
the evil actually loaded up score center
faster first time around so that kind of
gives you ideas for is the RAM um
basically what you're going to be
getting is your apps once you have a
bunch open is really gonna make a
difference
but you know if you have just a couple
of apps open like I did in the beginning
didn't really make a difference both of
them we're opening up at pretty much the
same time but now you can see the galaxy
s3 with that extra gigabyte of RAM is
pretty much loaded every single
application faster than the Evo 4G LTE
did so the RAM definitely made a
difference um especially you know when
you have this many applications open in
the background mean all of these guys
are pretty much open you know I could
tap on you know gym rat and you see it's
still open I could go back and go all
the way to the top and we'll tap on
dictionary and it's still open so it's
not loading these guys up again we're
you know over here let's go to the task
manager you see it's 150 mi guys free um
let's go ahead and try to go to I mean
these are the apps are open you can see
all of them aren't they're coming it's
only what's core Center Google Maps
calculators open color notes WordPress
messages in YouTube but all the other
ones are pretty much closed out so you
know if I were to go dictionary again
like I said it's gonna learn much faster
in here so anyway um that's the
difference you know it's not that big of
a deal honestly in the long run I mean
um you know both phones are super fast
the 1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon processor
does a great job at opening up
applications and her ice cream
sandwiches optimization especially when
jellybean comes around both these
devices both are going to be super fast
but you know what the two gigabytes is
gonna give you a faster experience
mainly due to the fact especially when
you have a lot of applications open that
those applications we open up in the
background and when you tap on them it's
going to be already open so there's
gonna be nothing to load therefore
you're gonna have a faster experience
not necessarily faster speed as far as
processors go but anyway that's it for
me in this video if you found it helpful

a lot and scribe some channel thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
