calm and in this video we're doing a
review on the 3gs 3 release 3 rom from
team sonic on the samsung galaxy s3 i'll
put the link to the XDA thread in the
description box below this rom is based
off of TouchWiz 4.0 point for from
t-mobile I'll go ahead and turn this guy
on and I saw that way guys could see the
boob animation first thing you'll notice
on the problem is the sounds have been
removed from the boot up and shut down
animations and you know that for example
on this version the t-mobile version you
don't see the t-mobile logo or anything
like that you're seeing the samsung logo
so pretty cool the rom is of course
fully deodexed zip line has super user
busybox all that good stuff has all the
bloatware removed for the most part
carry IQ is removed as well and upon
boot up so we're going to check that out
as 1.2 gigabytes of ram free so go ahead
and check that guy out as you can see
373 megabytes if I go up a little bit as
it starts load here you go so 400
megabytes being used of the 1.62 so like
I said about 1.2 free so that's nice to
see on here we'll go ahead and go right
into what is featured on the rump so
first thing is that I want to go over a
let's go over in order of these little
shortcuts is the shortcuts right over
here at the top so your toggles have
been customized now so now you have
obviously you have your Bluetooth Wi-Fi
and GPS but you can actually customize
these guys at the top so it's nice you
know I have one for the flashlight so
you know if I just tap this guy it's
gonna turn off my flashlight right there
so I could turn off turn back on really
nice to have that right there because
that's something that you know i like to
use you know right on the spot you can
scroll over i have brightness and screen
timeout but that's all i have but you
could actually put a lot more those are
only ones i really use but i'm going to
show you how you can customize them so i
went to this quick panel settings app
right here that's included on the rom
and you can just go to the widget blends
and you can see you can choose from you
know having the ability to reboot to
shut down to a airplane mode all the
ones i discussed earlier the lock screen
mobile data sound all that good stuff um
you know brightness modes and sound
modes so
you have all those options which is
definitely nice to see I me I really
that's probably one of my favorite
features on here go ahead and back out
of here next thing you'll see is the CPU
sleeper so this for the t-mobile version
I'm supposed to help with battery life
another thing is you have awesome beats
this is basically like Beats Audio gives
you the optimization of your you know
sound so you can get better sounding
music and things like that you go for a
headset speaker and bluetooth go ahead
and back out of here the phone also has
audio and audio enhancing hack by meltus
basically what that does is it pushes
the speaker on the back of this guy to
the max so you're going to be able to
get louder sounds from your Galaxy s3
speaker without of course blowing it out
any louder probably would I mean that's
the warning that the developer states in
this thread next thing is that you have
the jellybean animations here so when
you're going in and out of applications
for example I'll see here you go out you
see how quick the transitions are you
can see how the animations look like
jellybeans really cool go ahead and go
to the settings we're looking so you
guys can see the software version we're
not so you see is 4.04 I've the t-mobile
version of the galaxy s3 right here you
see says free gsm-r 3gs 3g sm released
three so we'll go ahead and back out of
here now and go into the restaurant so
you can see a swipe installer has been
put on the phone that's if you want the
swype keyboard I don't really want us
I'm going to delete that soon the
YouTube app is a little bit different so
I'll go ahead and open this guy up so
you guys can see it's actually as the
Black team so it's kind of like it was
before the new update but it's nice to
see you know having you have the new
youtube app but a black background so
pretty cool to see I mean works pretty
much the same way there's also another
YouTube app I'm still actually I already
uninstalled it though because I don't
use it but basically it looks like the
old version of YouTube with Gingerbread
but it has the extra ability of being
able to download a video straight from
youtube on your phone I don't really do
that so I just deleted it off my phone
already but that's the only change there
let's see what else so another feature
that this wrong has is a voice recording
or call recording so let me go ahead and
make a quick call and demonstrate how
that works we'll do a sprint store
I know this one has a little answering
machine that picks up right away all
right so there you go so now I'm
connected to a call i can just tap
record and you can see it's recording
the call so I'll just record it for a
little bit and i'll stop now and we'll
go ahead and see if we listen to it so
hit home we'll go to my files what's SD
card and let's see where it is so i
believe it's under sounds call recording
will seize the sound player to player so
there you go see us to hear that call
was recorded I'm claudi sounds pretty
good too so anyway that's just another
one of the features you have a little
CRT animations which is kind of like you
know it wasn't gingerbread so when you
press the power button it's gonna look
like a little old-school TV turning off
so pretty cool there go ahead and unlock
the sky and let me think oh yeah you all
the camera also have has the asst oni
bravia engine so while when you using
the camera on this guy so where is my
camera icon and are you taking a picture
so let me grab something to take a
picture of real quick i'll just do this
little android and so taking a picture
of something you're gonna it's gonna
come out a little bit better i mean
whoops i'm doing a video here let me
undo that really quick um i haven't
really tested the camera honestly so i'm
just going off about what they said but
suppose that the Bravia Engine and
obviously I've seen side-by-side
pictures of Bravia Engine versus just
regular and it does look better with the
proper engine so I'll have to you know
do it like a few video samples and
things like that or just take pictures
and put them on phone buff so you guys
can see the difference but anyway that's
included on the ROM nothing you'll
notice is when we go in turn off Wi-Fi
so on the t-mobile version you have the
instead of the 4g icon you're going to
have the h plus icon there so hspa+
which is honestly more accurate than you
know saying 4G so I do like that
um and uh let me see what else am I
missing I think of the power lines
little difference on me when you pull
press the whole power you have the same
options you normally would but when you
tap restart you're going to have the
option to reboot hot boot go into
download mode our recovery so pretty
nice to be able to have that you know
right there so that's pretty much all
the features I let's go ahead and you
know do a quick you know this kind of
walked over the app you guys are the rom
you guys can see it's really fast I mean
it almost feels like there's jellybean
install in here I mean like as it was
like project butter it is very very fast
I did benchmarks on here the intent to
limp at quadrant and NMR I'm not gonna
do him when this video because honestly
I pretty much got the same results i was
getting with the stock rom so really no
point in doing that if you guys want to
see what the scores are check the
channel out and there's actually you
know i did i already did a benchmarking
of decal accessory so similar scores
there but overall you know so far I've
only had it for like a couple of hours
really I just felt like doing a quick
review for you guys base up my first
impressions and that so far it feels
good mean there's nothing you know
nothing wrong with it I haven't noticed
any bugs just yet i'll be using as my
daily driver for a couple of days maybe
a week or so I'm and maybe I keep you
guys updated if you guys have any
questions let me know in the comments
and I'll try to get back to you as soon
as I can't but anyway that's a quick
little overview of the 3gs 3 release 3
rom from team sonic like i said i put
the link in the description box below
check it out and obviously if you have a
rooted sts-3 go ahead and flashes cow on
your phone but anyway i said from me in
