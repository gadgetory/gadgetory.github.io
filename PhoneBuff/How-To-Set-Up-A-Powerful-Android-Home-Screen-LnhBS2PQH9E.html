in this video I just want to share with
you guys how I set up my Android phones
home screen to be much more efficient
than it was previously so before I go
into that I want to show you guys what
inspired me to change my home screen
setup and that's actually my Windows
Phone after using this guy for a month
going back to my android phone I
realized how much more efficient my
windows phone setup was or just Windows
Phone in general was then Android
because the way the home screen is set
up so for example on Windows Phone if I
you know have my phone locked and I want
to open up my calculator really quick
this unlock it tap calculator and I'm
there so you can see it's just really
quick that's why you know you'll see
Microsoft really pushing the idea that
Windows Phone is quicker they even have
that that smoked by Windows Phone
challenge at their stores where they'll
actually pay you if you could open up a
couple of apps or post things on
Facebook faster than they could on their
Windows Phone so anyway I want to show
you guys how I do it on my Android phone
to make it as efficient as Windows Phone
if not more efficient really I feel like
it's more efficient so anyway I'll go
and show you some of the folders that
I've made you can see I have eight app
folders here and I think harnessing the
power of folders really is the secret to
making your phone more efficient and
also widgets but first thing I want to
talk about is folders so instead of
having a whole bunch of apps rocket
service for example if these are just
regular app shortcuts I would only have
eight you know and obviously I have more
than eight apps that I use on a everyday
basis or you know at least every couple
of days I would have to you know use
other home screens but didn't have this
widget here and you know does this
really kind of takes away from the
efficiency I think because you know
having to scroll through home screens to
get to what you want really defeats the
purpose I mean you might as well be
going through app lists looking for a
specific shortcut so anyway I want to
show you some of the folders up mates
for for example I have a phone book
folder right here just has two apps
related to phonebook comm so for example
if I wanted to edit a post of Pombo comm
I can just quickly tap on this guy
tap on WordPress and edit my posts if I
wanted to open up my calculator I just
tap on tools and tap on calculator and I
have a couple of other apps in here on
the tool app dictionary flashlight notes
etc
I'm having my finance app so for example
to check my balance at Bank of America
do that
if I wanted open up my camera my gallery
can tap on media and go over here so
these are all these folders I made I
renamed them all based off what I fit or
what I thought best fit the category or
the folder for example one one good
example is the games folder I have 12
games right here and you know just a
heck of a lot easier finding what game I
want to play if I'm bored
you know how the dentist's office while
I'm waiting in the waiting room instead
of having to you know scroll through
here and figure out you know what game I
want to play you know based off looking
at the shortcuts through my apple√≠s so
definitely just more efficient set up I
feel like so for example now I'll show
you you know a practical use of it so
say I wanted to check the movie times
right
I could just unlock my phone really
quick go to my entertainment tab because
I know it's there tap off Flixter and
boom I have my movie times and the
theaters near me so just a really quick
way a really efficient way to use your
Android phone there's also you know more
than easy to do with widgets for example
if I want to see my five-day forecast I
just tap my widget right here got my
five-day forecast if I want to make my
brightness on my phone screen a little
bit lower because my battery is dying I
can just quickly tap on this guy and
change my brightness just by tapping
this little widget also let's say
there's a Laker game going on and wanted
to see the score
I get tap on this guy and an open up
score Center but not just score Center
it'll actually open up these specific
games so right here you can see it opens
up the card to that game so another cool
feature of widgets let's say for example
I wanted to listen to music I give this
scroll over here tap play and listen to
a song instead of having to scroll to my
home screens or through my app list for
the music player of course I have my
most commonly used apps right here at
the bottom so these are just regular
apps rockets I could put folders here if
I wanted to so I gotta have you know a
total of 12 home screens are folders but
instead are on my home screen but you
know I'm fine with eight because pretty
much these cover what I'm looking for
for example you know I've entertainment
I have my finance apps I have my media
games email I have a couple of email
accounts and actual labels within those
email account so I can go straight to
the label if I wanted to
over here under settings I have like my
file manager app I've called Boeing plus
and also specifics shortcuts to the
settings so not just the regular
settings where you know I top the
settings and it goes here
but the say for example I wanted to see
my battery stats or you know how much
battery I have left I just have that and
go straight to my battery settings so
pretty cool feature on Android you can
just add shortcuts and you know add them
into this little widget or this little
folder and this makes everything a
little bit easier to get into alright
that's pretty much it for me in this
video I mean hopefully I've given you an
idea or two that you could use to make
your Android phone a little bit more
efficient and maybe you know you could
go to a Microsoft Store and challenge
those windows phones and see if we could
win yourself I think they're giving away
like a thousand dollar gift card right
now so anyway that's it for me in this
