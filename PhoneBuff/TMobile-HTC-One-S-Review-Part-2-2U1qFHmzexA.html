can see it scored a 4812 so that's
pretty much what i've gotten every time
i've run the test it's always over 4,800
or at least over 4700 and it definitely
reflects you know how the device
actually performs in the real world I've
done speed tests on form of comm
comparing it to the Galaxy Nexus
comparing it to phones like the Galaxy
Note and the iphone 4s and it
outperforms all of them so definitely
one of the fastest phones out there next
thing I want to talk about as far as
what I like about the phone is actually
HTC Sense so usually you know I'm not
too fond of manufacturer you eyes on
phones but I think HTC did a great job
with sense for making it lightweight
you're not getting in the way too much
of everything when you open it up I mean
you just have your sideways scrolling
for the apps like you do on ICS you have
a cool little set of tabs right here for
your frequently used app so it's just
the top apps that use most often you
could actually go to download it up see
the apps that you've downloaded yourself
from the Google Play Store you can
search through your typing search of
course you go to the play store and get
some options to customize by pressing
the more button but the home screens or
of course you know editor or a
customizable you just tap home twice and
you could delete or add home screens as
you wish like that let's see when you
drop down from the notification menu
have the settings option which you know
we saw in the Galaxy Nexus on the Galaxy
Nexus over here but over here it's on
the top right and I actually find a lot
easier to get to than that little button
on the Galaxy Nexus the settings is
white so it's not black like you see on
stock ICS but definitely looks really
clean on that's the whole thing about
HTC Sense I mean I feel like it really
makes the phone much more visually you
know appealing when you scroll like this
has a little cool little effect right
there which you know the little tabs are
separating certain things also that
agency ads in with their software like
this this tab right here for app
associations isn't on Ice Cream Sandwich
by default this lets you see you know
what apps are associated what like web
URL is associated with dolphin if I
wanted to change that I can go here and
steady man having to go into the
settings into the app menu and clearing
the defaults in order to be able to edit
that another thing
as cool is when you go to storage you
could actually tap this guy right here
that says make more space so you tap
make more space and they actually clear
out your temporary data for apps that
either you haven't used in the last week
or all the apps that you have your phone
so I'll just go with this one hit next
and it's loading up the applications and
there you go it's clearing them and you
could also uninstall these apps or you
can move them to the phone storage so
I'll just hit move to storage see what
happens and I you know it's give me the
list of apps I could check them hit next
so we'll just do next there you go had a
little bit of trouble tapping that guy
and you can see it's moving applications
to the storage and there you go so I'm
just gonna go ahead and back out of here
I mean hopefully I gives you a better
idea as far as that future goes go back
into the settings of course with HTC
sense you have the ability to
personalize pretty much everything you
can select different scenes um you know
depending on what you're doing at that
moment you could apply different skins
so right now on the regular 1i let's go
ahead and apply the to the matte black
theme let's see how that looks alright
so as you can see the clock widget
changed um nothing much changed here if
I go to the lock screen you can see now
it's black instead of silver so pretty
cool way to customize your phone you
know without having to have rude or
anything like that and like I said it is
lightweight and especially with ice
cream crs the ability to disable apps
which is a how-to on form of comm if you
don't know how I got rid of all the you
know most of the t-mobile when I
consider bloatware apps that were just
pretty much taking up room on my phone
and not only room but just you know how
to scroll through them which made it
kind of annoying but anyway I got rid of
those so it has you know pretty much
just the basic sense on there and all
the apps i want not necessarily t-mobile
wants me to have so pretty cool to be
able to have that option overall like i
said i'm happy with sense it's
lightweight doesn't get in the way um
and the last thing i want to talk about
as far as what I I'm not going to say
like honestly love about the HTC One S
is the camera camera is definitely the
best camera I've used on pretty much
phone not necessarily just for quality
reasons but for the features that has so
here's my galaxy nexus and i'll see if i
could take some pictures of this guy so
let me unlock it alright so bear with me
for one second let me turn the
brightness up so we can actually see it
there you go alright so I'm going to go
ahead and take some pictures of it so of
course you can take a picture like you
normally would by just tapping it like
this the icon and there you go but if
you wanted to take multiple shots and
this is great for when I'm taking
pictures of my nephew he's a little baby
obviously they move around a lot or if I
take a picture of my dog it's hard to
get a good shot with them when they're
always moving around you just press and
hold it's going to take multiple shots
and when you're done you can review it
and obviously you're going to have a
bunch of pictures to choose from I could
choose the one I like best I just hit
best shot right here so just gonna go
ahead and rotate it back hit best shot
and it's going to automatically delete
up the rest of them if I wanted to say
yes and there you go deletes all of them
goes right back to the camera I get
switched to a video recording mode right
here so it's nice to have the options
you know right then and there are right
here um and what's really cool which you
know I didn't see before is you have the
ability to record slow motion videos so
let me go ahead and go and see if I can
show you guys that so it's under camera
options I believe actually notes under
video options and then the hallway I'm
sorry it's under here you go you hit the
a over here and then slow motion videos
so slow motion video you can see the
icon over here changed and it has a
little guy running and basically what
it's doing is so I'm just going to move
my phone left and right and around like
that and I'm gonna stop recording now
we're going to go ahead and watch that
video and want to show you guys how it
looks so it's pretty cool me if you're
just outside and recording something you
could literally record it in slow motion
so uh so you can see literally caught in
slow motion obviously there's no sound
because you can't really slow down the
sound of just sound all garbled up so
you just have the video but really cool
to see that um you know just looks
awesome it's kind of like the time lapse
but this slope regular to slow motion
video so anyway that gives the idea as
far as the camera goes like I said the
quality on here is really really good um
I just love the
features HD included unlocking to the
camera is super super fast let's call it
that and literally opens up right away
and that's a reflection of not only you
know HTC's dedicated chip for the camera
but also the s4 processor and of course
Ice Cream Sandwich all combined just
giving you a great user experience but
that's pretty much more review on the AC
1 s overall like i said i love the phone
definitely giving it a thumbs up there's
only a few drawbacks that i have with it
but you know if you're on t-mobile is
definitely a guy out look at i'll also
look at the galaxy nexus maybe if you're
looking for a better screen as far as
resolution goes but when it comes to
speed and some of the features that come
with HTC sense i don't think anything is
really going to match the HTC one s but
