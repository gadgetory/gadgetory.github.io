farmville calm and today I'm reviewing
the HTC amaze 4g available from t-mobile
so to start off this guy's a 4.3 inch
Super LCD qhd display that's 960 x 540
resolution on the screen and on the top
of the screen you have a two point O
marisol camera you have your standard
for capacitive buttons on the bottom for
home menu back and search on the very
top device you have a 3.5 million
headset jack with your power key on the
right side you have your volume rocker
for up and down and one of my favorite
features is a dedicated camera button
but also dedicated camcorder button so
that's really nice to see on the left
sided device you have your micro USB
charging port on the bottom you have
your microphone and of course in the
back you have your 8 megapixel camera
with dual-led flash and that's capable
of taking 1080p video capture with your
speaker grill on the very back as well
so that's a hardware tour a quick harder
for you guys I'm going to run a
benchmark while give you some of the
other specs so we're doing out two
things at once here alright so on the
inside of device as a 1.5 gigahertz
dual-core processor 2 Snapdragon s3 and
has one gigabyte of RAM it has 16
gigabytes of internal storage built in
with a microSD card slot expandable up
to 32 gigabytes of additional storage
you have a 1730 milliamp battery and you
have android 2.3 point for at least
right now running the show which HTC
said they're going to update it to ice
cream sandwich whenever that is so i'll
go ahead and let this test run i'll skip
to the end and give you the results all
right so it looks like the benchmark is
done i'll go ahead and hit yes so you
get the results and for what it's worth
this device scored a 20 35 so 2035 so of
course this is squadron and the app
hasn't been updated for you know over a
year now so take it for what its
worth of course I think real life
performance a lot better than that go
ahead and run another benchmark a 22 so
go ahead and run the test and I'll just
skip to the end so you guys see the
results all right so it looks like tests
done scoring a 5581 I'll go ahead and go
to score chart and the bar chart so you
can see a comparison so when you bring
this closer to the screen right you can
see my device 5005 and 81 so above
phones like the LG optimus 2x and evo 3d
and you can see is just below the
samsung galaxy s2 and galaxy nexus and
devices like that but pretty good score
I mean that's kind of the performance
you get I mean I've tested the galaxy s2
end I'll say this one's a little bit
slower than the galaxy s2 but not by
much so that's a pretty accurate
benchmark in our from my point of view
all right so the last benchmark I'll run
is the browser mark benchmark for the
browser so I'll go ahead and open up the
browser type in browser mark brow whoops
browser mark you know I'll just go to
Google all right browsing work and go
ahead and run the test and again I'll
just skip to the end so you guys can see
the results alright so the benchmark is
done and the phone scored a 60 2269 so
that's my last benchmark that'll do and
hopefully that gives you a better idea
as far as how the device will perform
when you get it alright so I want to
talk about a look and feel device
because that's something that really
makes it stand out compared to some of
the other devices out there on the front
you can see this silver outline and that
goes around all the edges on the back
you have this rubberized material
alongside the aluminum casing so it is a
unibody design so when I take the
battery our back cover off you can see
it's just two pieces but a lot of the
internals are on the battery or the back
cover itself so uh really just gives you
a high-end feel I mean I
I got this why I just felt like it was
you know a premium device and it felt
really high quality especially comparing
it to a phone like the galaxy s2 which
has more of a plastic infield but of
course the plastic mix phone lighter
this one's a little bit heavier weighing
in at 6.1 ounces it also makes it a
little bit thicker at eleven point eight
millimeters but you know that's the kind
of that's the college that you get with
having more of that premium build
quality or at least feel that you get
from the Amaze alright so another thing
I want to talk about is the screen it's
a qhd screen so it has 960 x 540
resolution if you're comparing it to
another tmobile phone like the galaxy s2
are you going to get a lot more clarity
on this screen because of the higher
resolution so when you're looking at the
text going to look a lot more crisp when
you're in the browser you're not gonna
have to zoom in as much to be able to
read the text which kind of makes up for
having a smaller screen size at 4.3
pushes 4.5 screen is very bright now it
isn't super amoled like the galaxy s2 is
it's a super LCD but from my test you
know it's comparing side side it looked
pretty good and I do like the higher
resolution on the screen but the screen
isn't really what makes this phone stand
out I really feel like that's the camera
and you can see that from the initial
harbor tour that has a dedicated camera
and camcorder but you can see that the
focus this phone has is on the camera so
i'll go ahead and launch the camera up
and i'll try to take a picture of let's
see i'll just take a picture of this
Duracell battery so like you get it in
here alright so I you can see how clear
that looks I'm not sure how well it's
going to come through on camera but what
I really like is the close-up shots you
know when it gets nice and close the
autofocus just gets so I compared this
to some of the other phones like even
the iPhone I this one you know you're
able to zoom in a little bit closer and
it comes to nice and clear so definitely
definitely a good camera HC put a lot of
focus on that and actually let me show
you some of the different modes that
they have so you have your auto shot and
then you have your smart shot which is I
used for basically an array of shots
combined to create the best photo at
least that's what HTC is saying on the
sweep shots more of a pattern
mode you have your clear shot which is
made for things that are in you know
bright situations or environments
birdshot take a whole bunch of pictures
at once your night shots to have better
low-light situations and let's see the
macro shots really what can make you
zoom in even closer than i was earlier
to take up you know i took a picture of
my fingerprints and it looked great so
just that gives you a better idea as far
as how close you can zoom in and you
just have your portrait mode as well so
you have a lot of different options as
far as scenes for the camera and a HTC
really put a emphasis on the camera and
you know front facing camera is to mex
so it's really good as well and i just
really love the camera i can't say
enough about it i'd even say that it's
better than the iphone 4 s's camera at
least from my experience testing the two
devices i'm not too sure about the video
because i feel like the video quality is
a little bit better on the forest but
actual picture quality I feel like it's
better on the ACMA's alright so the last
thing I want to show you is HTC sense
3.0 which is running over top of Android
on the Amaze and basically what sense is
is it's HTC's custom UI which adds a lot
of features that you normally wouldn't
get with a stock rom and also makes
things a little bit easier to access for
example on your home screen you can
pinch out and you'll have a display of
all seven of your home screens and you
can tap on whatever one you want to jump
right to it so it makes a little bit
easier to go to Home screen the home
screen such when you have so many like
seven on this device and you can also go
to the old way by you know scoring left
and right like you normally would and
that what's cool HD has this little
animation where it'll spin around like
that so it's nice to look at but as far
as functionality doesn't really do much
fact actually gets in the way because
sometimes I found over the last two
weeks that I've been using the device
that when I'm trying to scroll from home
from the home screen sometimes it will
just jump like that when I'm trying to
go over one so you can get annoying or
get in the way sometimes but like I said
I like to pinch out and go to ocean
ocean like that unless i'm going over
just one where I make sure I go slow but
overall I do like the layout of the home
screens if I go to the app tray one
thing I'll say
normally I don't like vertical outcries
like this because it's kind of hard to
track what app you're looking at you
just have like one long list but HD has
done a good job by separating that and
that making them pages like you would
get with a horizontal layout so you see
there's four pages right here that I'm
scrolling through and it makes a lot of
easier to find the app you're looking
for especially when you get familiar
with the device so not only does it have
that but it has a frequent tab which
shows you to your top 20 apps that you
use most often you'll also go to
downloaded tab and see what actually
downloaded from the market yourself and
going to look at the notification bar so
you have your recent 8 apps that you've
used similar to the way that you'd see
when you press and hold home but it's
nice to have right here in a
notification bar in scroll through them
makes it really easy to switch tasks
while you're in them and you can also go
to quick settings here at the very
bottom right which gives you toggles for
Wi-Fi your hotspot mobile network
Bluetooth GPS and at your settings and
right here it says total memory and what
it is is a task manager which will show
you your open apps which I don't have
any right now but i'll show you open
apps and also show you how much RAM your
phone is currently using so you can free
up your RAM is what hitting kill wall
and closing those applications in the
background so that's pretty much what
you'll see as far as the HTC Sense layer
goes out I want to show you the
personalized tab that you get on here so
you have the option do scenes which is
one something that unique that you'll
see on that HTC phone that you normally
won't see on other phones and basically
what scenes are is a custom layouts of
your home screen you could actually save
them or switch them for example right
now on t-mobile's scene I'll go to this
place theme Arsene yeah basically it's
like a theme should I say but they call
it scene so anyway now you can see my
whole home screen layout is different
from what it was before so it's a pretty
cool especially if you're you know when
I customize like one scene for work one
scene for home and one seam for you know
road trip or whatever so that's a cool
feature you know it's nice to see that
customizable option and then of course
you could do skins which lets you change
the color scheme of the
so I'll just put burgundy so that way
everything I you know press on or when I
press a button it'll highlight in
Burgundy so I'll show you what I mean go
ahead and a tap once when you can see is
it's all Brittany so close out of that
alright so let's go back to the
personalized tab and you can see you
also have the option for your wallpaper
and lock screen you have your normal
options like widget apps shortcuts and
folders they get add to your home screen
and then your personalize your sound
options like your ringtone notification
sound an alarm so uh you can access this
again by pressing the little button
right here or you could press and hold
anywhere on an empty spot on your home
screen and we'll bring it up so it's
nice little feature that you know HTC
has on here and lets you really
personalize your phone to the way you
like it alright so some of the apps that
come pre-loaded with sense our apps like
french stream and flashlight and clock
clock giving you the alarm a world clock
a timer in a stopwatch you have
flashlights which is a normal flashlight
app but it gives you three different
levels of brightness for the LED on the
back which is pretty nice i'm works
better than any of the flashlight apps
out there at least for this phone and
you also have apps like HTC hub and HTC
likes you have your preloaded t mobile
apps like my account and t-mobile TV HD
video chat by quick and of course visual
voicemail so uh everything you have is
pretty much installed on the phone of
course you have the android market and
overall i have to say i really do like
sense like I said it gives you a feeling
of customization I could personalize the
phone to however you like and I do like
the the way the app tray works and how
everything's all organized alright so
that's pretty much it on the HTC mas 4g
I really enjoyed this phone over the
last two weeks that I've been testing it
and I feel like this phone is really
made for those of you who are looking
for a top notch camera on the smartphone
with the premium build quality and fast
speeds because it really delivers all
three areas especially with the build
quality and the camera just by looking
at it you can tell that HT put a lot of
work into it with a dedicated camcorder
and camera buttons you can see even from
the lock screen I could access it by
pressing and holding on it so you'll
never miss any of your moments
with this phone build quality is great
and of course you're on that t-mobile 4g
network and like i said it's pretty much
it if you're looking for more
