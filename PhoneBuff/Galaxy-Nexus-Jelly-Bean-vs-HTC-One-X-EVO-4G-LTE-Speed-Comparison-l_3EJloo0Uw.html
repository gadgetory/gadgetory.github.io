that's what i'm doing a speed comparison
test between the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
this is the unlocked HSPA+ version
against the HTC One X this is the sprint
evo 4G LTE variant I've done a
comparison says our speaker's perception
the Galaxy Nexus and HTC One S which is
pretty much a little brother of this car
but I using the same processor and the
HTC One S did win but this time around
I'm gonna be using jellybean on this
Galaxy Nexus so it's gonna be a little
bit different so let's go ahead and test
it against the big brother and see what
it can do we'll go ahead and start with
the bit up test so we're gonna press
power at the same time what do you guys
so one two three hold it for a couple of
seconds and let go now I don't have
fast-food enabled on the HTC One X so
keep that in mind if I did enable
fast-food it probably load up maybe up
four times as fast so we'll see which
one loads up first here and you know how
close it is and then you know taking
that into consideration when not you
enable fast food so both phones are
gonna be running on the same Wi-Fi
network I cleared out browsing history
on both phones so when we do the browser
test it'll be nice and even this guy's
running the 1.5 liter dual-core
Snapdragon s4 this guys running the 1.2
gigahertz dual-core TI OMAP 4460 so
obviously this guy loaded up first as
far as the boot up time you see it's
dirty ready I can unlock it and you know
I'm at my home screen as you can see I
have nothing else on my home screen just
this one screen of applications and I
have the same exact screen on the HTC
One X so it's gonna be nice and even
there are there its way through this
guy's he finished loading up unlock you
can see it's still loading so it makes a
huge difference on enabling fast food I
mean I don't know why the regular boot
up takes so long on the HTC One X but
when you enable fast boot it's like
literally four times faster I pretty
much think it would beat out the Galaxy
Nexus 2 because it's hard to like maybe
10 seconds so anyway let's go ahead and
start our first application speed test
which is Google Earth so let's go ahead
and hit earth on both these guys looks
like the HTC One X has a slight
advantage but
much going at the same rate right now
we're gonna see which one gives us the
vaguest view first so you can see this
is already loading up the building's far
to zoom in on here it's actually zooming
on a certain building so zoom in on I
shouldn't let me make sure 3d buildings
sawn yeah it is all right so we'll load
up we'll do the win so the win on Quora
hotel tap it and you can see actually
the galaxy nexus responded a little bit
faster but let's see how smooth each one
is so far it looks smoother on the
galaxy nexus surprisingly looks a little
bit choppy on the HTC One X compared to
the Galaxy Nexus
maybe that's due to jelly beans
optimizations because I know that the
hard Brown here is actually better than
it is on the galaxy Knights so somewhat
surprising to see all right so that's
good enough of a test right there we'll
go ahead and hit home I'm not gonna
close out the applications because well
they're both running Android so it's
gonna be nice and even I probably turn
off this live wallpaper really quick
didn't even notice that so let's go
ahead and just tap on this all rights go
to the next application which is
dictionary so one two three so it loaded
up a little bit faster on the HTC One X
but I got a little pop-up so we'll call
it go to the next one to Flixter so we
get it you know a clear result so
definitely faster on the One X here
let's go ahead and hit home and it's
open up the Play Store hopefully this
will give us a better idea because I
keep getting pop ups and stuff on the
applications this time the galaxy next
session loaded up so the Google app
loaded up faster again on the Galaxy
Nexus it's going up open up the
calculator so one two three open up much
faster on the HTC One X let's go ahead
and open up maps load it up much faster
on the HTC One X go ahead and hit home
and let's go ahead and open up the
cameras at the same time see which one
loads up the camera for
so one two three this guy looked like it
was gonna go faster but HT 1x caught up
and loaded up the viewfinder much
quicker let's go ahead and run a
quadrant benchmark test now just so we
get a you know benchmark results so hit
run and I'll just skip to the visuals
for you guys so you guys want to watch
this whole thing
I saw both these guys are done say yes
and the score we got on the girls Nexus
was a 2188 so 2188 and on the HT 1x we
got you know more than double that four
thousand eight hundred and ninety three
so you know the software doesn't really
make a difference here the quadrant
benchmark really tests the hardware and
the hardware is far superior on the HTC
One X than it is on the Galaxy Nexus so
let's go ahead and back out of here and
now we'll go to the browser and see how
you know which browser is actually
faster so we'll load up phone buff calm
first all right so I loaded it up one
two three turn the content first on the
Galaxy Nexus and there you go the galaxy
nest is now done if you see when is
actually still going but looks like it
was mostly done for the most part I mean
I don't know what I was loading up in
the background let's go ahead and do a
pinch-to-zoom test so you can see super
smooth on the HTC One X do the same
thing on the Galaxy Nexus and maybe even
more so smooth on the Galaxy Nexus so
that's that jelly beans uh project
butter right there so let's go ahead and
open up this al-baqarah this article
loaded up first here I mean I saw the
picture first let's go ahead and go to
another website let's go to nfl.com
alright one two three load it up here
first I can actually scroll down this
one is really like I don't know I'm
usually it goes a little bit faster than
that let's go ahead and go to the
desktop version one two three
and it looks like the content is more so
loaded on here yep this one's definitely
loading Oh faster even though the status
bar looked like it finished first on
here I'm you see this guy's a step ahead
of started loading up with you pictures
and whatnot so overall I mean with the
results pretty clear the HTC One X is
faster however jellybean did make a
difference here I mean Google Earth
seemed to load a little bit better the
Play Store opened up a little faster so
jelly bean didn't make a difference but
you know the hardware on the One X is
still not gonna be rivaled with from
compared to the hardware on the Galaxy
Nexus once this guy gets jelly bean you
know I expect this guy to really be out
there going that Galaxy Nexus even more
so but anyway that's it for me in this
