today I will be comparing the Galaxy
Nexus to the samsung galaxy s2 this case
the Epic 4G Touch variant and we're just
gonna be seeing which one loads up the
same map faster so we're gonna load up
four apps at the same time that Google
Earth movies score center and YouTube
and we'll see which one actually loads
the app faster of course this is running
Android Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0 this
guy's running Gingerbread 2.3 so keep
that in mind but let's go ahead and open
Google Earth at the same time and the
galaxy has two wand that battle so let's
back out of here and I did close out the
apps in the background just let you know
so of course only Google Earth is
running I'll back the sky out and uh
let's go to movies by Flixster so it
looks like the Galaxy Nexus wanna hit
skip at the same time on this case looks
like the epic loaded it faster so be the
judge of that one yourselves
let's do score center
so it looks like the epic or the galaxy
s2 was ahead again and lasts to YouTube
again the galaxy s2 looks like at one
let's go ahead and load up video so we
see which video loads up the fastest
will do this guy right here 1 2 3 and
you can see I mean it looks like the
epic is just one step ahead of the
Galaxy Nexus so yeah I mean that's what
I've noticed um it just seems a little
bit snappier probably because it's more
optimized I'm not sure of course it has
that akeno's processor running
underneath at one point to here it's
this guy's the TI OMAP 4460 that may be
the difference but those are the results
we've gotten this day from form of calm
thank you for watching the video and
don't forget to visit fumble for calm or
cell phone news reviews and how to's</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
