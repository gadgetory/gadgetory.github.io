you guys which one you wanted to see go
up against the node 9 in a speed test
and the majority B guys voted for the
iPhone 10 so here we are today we're
testing the thousand dollar models on
each of these phones which by you very
different things on the spec sheet the
no nine comes loaded with the snapdragon
845 six gigabytes of ram and a whopping
128 gigabytes of storage while the
iPhone 10 on the other hand has the
powerful a 11 Bionic ship but only comes
with half the storage at 64 gigabytes
and only half the RAM at a meager 3
gigabytes
now while the limited Ram on the iPhone
10 has obviously heard it in the second
lap of this test in the first lap it's
still technically undefeated with no
other phone being able to clock in a
faster time so it'll be interesting to
see if the note 9 with its all-new water
carbon cooling system can be that phone
to beat it and ultimately back up all
the smack that Samsung has been talking
about Apple in their ads let's get right
into it
all right we'll kick things off by
starting to stopwatch us on each phone
and then jump right into the first app
in Facebook where the note 9 is able to
get the step over the iPhone 10 only to
have the iPhone pass it up two seconds
later in Starbucks here in Microsoft
Word both ones are loading the same
massive 500 page Word documents with the
iPhone being able to do it faster adding
on to its early lead as it starts
working on excel where once again the
iPhone is able to finish loading the app
at a faster rate allowing it to pull a
full up ahead very early on in this
speed test with it editing the selfie
that it just took by adding a filter and
exporting the image out to storage let's
see if the no.9 can make up some ground
here performing the same exact task but
know it looks like it went through
Snapseed at a slightly slower rate as
well allowing the iPhone to pull even
further ahead as both phones start
working on lapses so just under half way
through this speed test iPhone has
actually built itself a nice little
cushion and what they're just blazing
through Google Trends and moving on to
the gaming row it only looks to improve
on its lead with the note 9 not doing
itself any favors by stuttering in the
browser but of course there's still
plenty of time for the note to make a
comeback and given how much Samsung has
been hyping up the note 9s gaming
capabilities it'll be interesting to see
if it can cut it into the iPhones lead
here in the gaming row but at least so
far it actually looks like the opposite
has happened with the iPhone 10 loading
both subway surfers and flip diving at a
faster rate and from the looks of it it
loaded fit the fat faster as well so as
the note 9 starts working on Bullough
pours the iPhone moves on to the last
row here in the first lap where it's
able to turn the one app lead it gained
early on in the test into a 2 app lead
as it finishes up with ESPN and starts
working on Netflix so finally a bit of
good news for the note 9 it's able to
load both Spotify and ESPN at a faster
rate allowing it to make up some ground
on the iPhone but not enough to catch it
here in the first lap with the iPhone 10
talking in an impressive time of 2
minutes and 9 seconds with the note
coming in 6 seconds later with a time of
2 minutes and 15 and here is where the
iPhone tends 3 gigabytes of RAM comes
back to haunt it with it failing to keep
flip diving open allowing these 6
gigabytes of RAM on the No
9 to push Samsung's flagship ahead with
it doing a good job by keeping all the
apps so far open and ready to go while
the iPhone continues to struggle falling
further and further behind the note 9 is
able to keep both Excel and Word open
and ready to go but it surprisingly
fails to keep Starbucks open but lucky
for it the iPhone fails to keep Excel
running
so despite stumbling late here in the
second lap the no 9 is able to finish
first with a total time of 3 minutes and
2 seconds with us fast porting the
iPhone to the finish line were after
struggling to keep all the other apps
open it completes the test with a total
time of 3 minutes and 29 seconds making
the winner the Galaxy Note 9 here are
the individual app load of times from
the first lap where the iPhone was able
to load most of the apps out of faster
rates except for the last four at the
end where the note 9 may have had an
advantage thanks to its water carbon
cooling system sustaining peak
performance but either way that is it
for me in this video thank you guys for
watching and as always I'll see you in
the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
