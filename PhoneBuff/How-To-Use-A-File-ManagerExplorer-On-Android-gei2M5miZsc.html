up calm and in this video I'm going to
show you how to use a file explorer or
file manager app on your Android phone
so as you can see I've already
downloaded installed a ES File Explorer
app from Google Play so this guy was
available for free there's also other
ones like Astro file manager but for the
purpose of this video I'm just going to
use this one as the example and an
analogy I like to make with this file
manager pilots wear apps on Android it's
it's kind of like you're you know my
computer or otherwise Windows Explorer
on your computer at home basically you
can edit all your folders and the files
within them through this app so one
example I have to use is actually my
voice recording app so you can see I
have all these voice recordings right
here but this particular app doesn't let
me delete my voice recordings in bulk so
basically I have to do it one by one
hitting delete so obviously that's kind
of annoying but with the file manager
app I could actually find the folder in
which the recordings are stored so in
this case it's recordings as you'd
expect and I can actually delete as many
as I want in bulk so I just have to hit
the select button up here and after
using another manager you might have to
press menu or otherwise it'd be
somewhere else but anyway most of them
have this functionality where you can
hit select and select things in bulk so
as you can see I've selected nine
recordings I just hit delete and delete
them off my phone I could also copy and
cut them and move them from one folder
for example to another so let's go ahead
and back out of here so this is one
example another example is you could
rename your albums for your pictures and
I've made another video about this so if
you wanted to hide a album all you have
to do is put a dot in front of the album
name from throwing up in your picture
galleries anyway if I wanted to do that
for this album in particular like this
press and hold on it hit rename and
rename it right there so you can't
really do that unless you have a file
manager app and you know just a whole
bunch of other functions or other ways
in which this is useful so another
example is I've downloaded apps on
google play before they don't like them
uninstall them the thing is when you
understand it doesn't
always clear out all the data associated
with the app so sometimes they'll be a
folder that the app created like the
folders over here that you know just
kind of left over even though it'll have
the app anymore which takes up space on
my phone so if you don't have a file
manager app you won't ever know that
it's on there and second of all you
won't be able to do anything about it
but with this app you know you can just
press and hold on a folder so say for
example I wanted to delete this gym rat
data folder which I don't because I
actually use that out but say I did I'll
just hit delete and delete it off my
phone and save myself how much room or
however much room that app was taking
and speaking of how much room I was
taking you actually see that by
scrolling down to the properties and
actually tell you there's 564 files
within that folder and it takes up a
total of ten point five three megabytes
so just lets you get a lot more detailed
information to about the files on your
phone but that's pretty much it you know
the main purposes of the file manager
apps are to select things in bulk to
explore what's on your phone you can
also if you're rooted you could actually
go into the settings and see your root
directory so let's go ahead and enable
that really quick and show you what that
looks like so you press up and this is
actually the main files of your whole
Android phone so it's not just what's on
your SD card or your storage and you
can't really do anything as far as
editing these unless you have root
permissions but if you do it lets do a
lot of things like deleting stock apps
and I've made videos up on doing that
homework comm if you're interested but
that's pretty much it for me in this
video because I wanted to give you guys
a quick walk through and show you there
is a value of having a file manager
