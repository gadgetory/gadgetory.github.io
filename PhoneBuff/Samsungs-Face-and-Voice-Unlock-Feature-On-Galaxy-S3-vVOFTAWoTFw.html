this video we're doing a review on
Samsung's face unlock and voice unlock
feature on the galaxy s3 so I've done a
review on this before on the channel but
it was just for face unlock I wanted to
show you guys the difference between you
know face and voice so you can see you
still have the regular old face unlock
feature just like you would with any HM
see how much phone but you have face and
voice right over here so let's go ahead
and see what this is all about this
thing you know it's not as secure as a
pin and pastor really know that of
course somebody could use a picture of
us and fool this guy so let's go ahead
and get it all my face so it can't
recognize my face and the next step
after this is gonna be asking for my
voice so it got my face let's go ahead
and give it my boys so you see it says
to use a three to five syllable word and
maintain a constant pitch I'll try to do
that we have to do it four times so
let's go ahead and say yeah Madagascar
Madagascar Madagascar Madagascar
Madagascar alright so it got my voice
says recognized let's go ahead and hit
done on here and we have to set up a
backward pattern or pin so let's go
ahead and do pattern and we'll just make
a big ol L do it one more time and hit
confirm hit okay and let's go ahead and
back out of here and slop the screen and
see how it works so of course we know
how face and lock works and then it's
gonna ask my voice as soon as it
recognizes my face so Madagascar voice
recognition complete and there you go it
unlocks my phone so of course the
question is you know how well is the
voice how well does the voice
recognition work I'll try to do it you
know what the different voice is gonna
be kind of hard but I'll try make on all
girly sounding voice to see if it'll
still recognize it let's go ahead and
try it so Madagascar and it says failed
to recognize voice so you can see it
does somewhat work honestly sometimes
I've done that same test and since
it goes through so it's not necessarily
the most secure that's why you know when
you go under the security settings and
go to the set your security type it says
low security under face and voice but I
don't know it's pretty cool just wanted
to share with you guys how that works
you know when I change my voice
sometimes like I said does get through
but you know I've let some of my friends
use it and it doesn't work for them so I
mean pretty cool but anyway that's
pretty much it for this for me in this
video I just want to show you how that
feature works it's pretty cool that
Samsung adds you know something like
that it does make it a little bit more
secure you know what's the chance of
someone who steals your phone yeah I
know face a lot to be fooled with a
picture what are the chances they have a
picture of you and also know your secret
word which is you know from you was
Madagascar definitely makes it a lot
more secure than just face unlock alone
but anyway
