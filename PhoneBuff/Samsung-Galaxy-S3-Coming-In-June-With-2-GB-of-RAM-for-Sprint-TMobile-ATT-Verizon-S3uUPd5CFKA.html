and big news from samsung today the
manufacturer just announced that the
galaxy s3 is going to be launching on
all four major carriers here in the US
that being / isin AT&amp;amp;T Sprint and
t-mobile and they said to expect it by
June now we already know that there's
gonna be an official june release date
for both sprint and t-mobile which
announced today that the phones will be
coming out on jun 21st verizon hasn't
given us an official release date just
yet but they're already taking
pre-orders so expecting sooner rather
than later and while we haven't heard
from ATT we expected to change in the
near future and really expect them to
follow suit with the other carriers I
long to get some time in June so anyways
um this year's galaxy s3 looks to be
priced at two hundred dollars with a 16
gigabyte version this is according to
both sprint and verizon who have already
released the pricing information anyway
two hundred dollars for the 16gb by
virgin with the two-year contract and
two hundred fifty dollars put it to
upper dia 32 you ever so our difference
for 16 gigs not that bad i'm on shall
probably up for the 32 gig version
anyways um this year's galaxy s3 is
actually very similar to the
international version as far as the way
it looks the screenshot is exactly the
same you have the same capacitive
buttons on the front you have that same
physical home button which you know
before in the US versions of the galaxy
we haven't seen any physical home
buttons where the international versions
of that both s1 s2 had that home button
so it's nice to see that you know we're
getting the same type of foam you know
worldwide of course there are some
differences being the processor to
support 4G LTE networks here in the
states using the Qualcomm Snapdragon s4
dual-core instead of the I keynotes for
quad core so it is a little bit of a
disappointment to me to see that we're
using the Snapdragon here in the United
States but you know separating S word
obviously is capable processor I've done
benchmarks on it and I've compared to
other phones in my videos on the channel
but again like I said you know that
Agnes were quite look like a little
blown out of the water but Samson
thankfully is making it up for us here
in the US they're giving us 2 gigabytes
of ram and
one like the international version so
that's a plus I mean two gigabytes
instead of one I don't know how much is
actually not help performance but should
definitely help multitasking a little
bit i mean it definitely can't hurt so
that's definitely nice to see but force
all the other you know features and
hardware it's all the same you have the
same 8-megapixel camera on the back that
1.9 megapixel camera on the front
capable of 720p you have the same
features like s voice you have s beam
and of course smart stay smart stay
being the technology where the
front-facing camera detects your face
and sees whether now you're looking at
the screen so that way determines
whether or not to turn off the screen
because you know I mean how many times
you've been reading an article online
and had to keep pressing the screen to
make sure that it doesn't actually turn
off so nice to see that there's
technology is going to be do able to do
that for us automatically all four
models look to have a 2,100 milliamp
battery obviously they're just gonna
have their branding on each version for
each carrier but other than that in all
four carriers are going to have pretty
much the same galaxy's there's not going
to be you know the controversial always
Sprint's version better than t-mobile's
and 18 TS and whatnot so nice to see you
know one version for all also with the
Canadian models are actually the same as
well so that's pretty much it for me
this video I mean the two colors for the
galaxy s3 are going to be pebble blue
and marble white just like the
international version so i don't know
i'm thinking about that white version
but the palpable looks nice to let me
know what you think i mean are you going
to get the galaxy s3 are you going to
hold out for the next nexus phone or
what are you thinking but anyway leave
your comments below thank you for
watching the video and please subscribe
if you like this video would be doing a
review on the galaxy s3 as soon as i get
my hands on that i'm going to be
comparing it to phones like the Galaxy
Nexus and you know the iphone 4 or
iphone 4s and 5 by the time it comes out
anyway that's it for me this video thank
you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
