calm and big news from samsung today the
manufacturer just announced that the
galaxy s3 is gonna be launching on all
four major carriers here in the US that
being pariahs in AT&amp;amp;T Sprint and
t-mobile and they said to expect it by
June now we already know that there's
gonna be an official June release date
for both Sprint and t-mobile which
announced today that the phones will be
coming out on June 21st
Verizon hasn't given us an official
release date just yet but they're
already taking pre-orders so expected
sooner rather than later and while we
haven't heard from 18t we expected to
change in the near future and really
expect them to follow suit with the
other carriers i'll long to get some
time in June so anyways um this year's
Galaxy s3
looks to be priced at $200 with a 16
gigabyte version this is according to
both Sprint and Verizon who have already
released the pricing information anyway
$200 for the 16 gigabyte version with
the two-year contract and $250 pretty
too up for the 32 new ever so our
difference for 16 gigs not that bad I'm
orange I'll probably opt for the 32 gig
version anyways this year's Galaxy s3 is
actually very similar to the
international version as far as the way
it looks the screen sounds exactly the
same
you have the same capacitive buttons on
the front you have that same physical
home button which you know before in the
US versions of the galaxy we haven't
seen any physical home buttons where the
international versions of that both s1
s2 had that home button so it's nice to
see that you know we're getting the same
type of foam you know worldwide of
course there are some differences being
the processor to support 4G LTE networks
here in the States
using the Qualcomm Snapdragon s4
dual-core instead of the akeno's 4 quad
core so it is a little bit of a
disappointment to me to see that we're
using the Snapdragon here in the United
States but you know separating s4
obviously is a capable processor I've
done benchmarks on it and I've compared
to other phones in my videos on the
channel but again like I said you know
that EGNOS will requite look like a
little blowing out of the water but
sampson thankfully is making it up for
us here in the u.s. they're giving us 2
gigabytes of RAM and
one like the international version so
that's a plus I mean two gigabytes
instead of one I don't know how much is
actually gonna help performance but
should definitely help multitasking a
little bit I mean it definitely can't
hurt so that's definitely nice to see
but far as all the other you know
features and hardware it's all the same
I mean you have the same eight megapixel
camera on the back that 1.9 megapixel
camera on the front capable of 720p you
have the same features like s voice you
have s beam and of course smart stay
smart stay being the technology where
the front-facing camera detects your
face and sees whether or not you're
looking at the screen so that way
determines whether or not to turn off
the screen because you know I mean how
many times have you been reading an
article online and had to keep pressing
the screen to make sure that it doesn't
actually turn off so nice to see that
there's a technology's gonna be able to
do that for us automatically all four
models look to have a 2100 milliamp
battery
obviously they're just gonna have their
branding on each version for each
carrier but other than that I mean all
four carriers are gonna have pretty much
the same galaxy's it's not going to be
you know the controversial always
Sprint's version better than t-mobile's
and 18 TS and whatnot so nice to see you
know one version for all also with the
Canadian models are actually the same as
well so that's pretty much it for me
this video I mean the two colors for the
galaxy s3 are gonna be pebble blue and
marble white just like the international
version so I don't know I'm thinking
about that white version but the pale
blue looks nice too let me know what you
think I mean are you gonna get the
galaxy s3 are you gonna hold out for the
next Nexus phone or what are you
thinking but anyway leave your comments
below thank you for watching the video
and please subscribe if you like this
video we'll be doing a review on the
galaxy s3 as soon as I get my hands on
that I'm gonna be comparing it to phones
like the Galaxy Nexus and you know the
iPhone 4 or iPhone 4s and 5 by the time
it comes out anyway that's it for me
this video thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
