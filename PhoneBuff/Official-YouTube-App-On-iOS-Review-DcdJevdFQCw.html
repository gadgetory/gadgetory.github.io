booths calm and in this one we're doing
a quick overview of the YouTube app on
iOS it's actually the iphone version
because the ipad version hasn't came out
yet but it's gonna be coming out in the
near future but i'm demonstrating it on
my iPad because i don't have my iphone
on me right now so let's go ahead and go
to the App Store and take a look at the
app page as you can see it is made by
google inc so it's the official youtube
app and there's a couple of reasons why
this has actually come up now instead of
into the future mainly because the
partnership or the licensing agreement
between youtube and Apple has expired
they opted not to renew it you just said
the main reason is because nobody can
make a better YouTube app than you to
themselves which is probably true but
another reason you know i think is
probably more of the reason is because
the iOS version of the youtube app
didn't allow for advertisements like the
youtube app on android does and
obviously that's how YouTube makes their
money and also their partners make their
money so it's clear to see why they did
this um honestly I think it's a good
thing because i'll show you right now
why i wasn't too happy with the iOS
version of the youtube app that's pretty
much you know been the same since the
iphone came out go ahead and tap on this
guy so against the iphone version I've
enlarge it on my iPad when you're when
you first open the app you're taken to
your feed page and you'll see the feed
of all your channels that you've
subscribed to I just download this so I
didn't actually log in and you can see
that i just have the popular videos that
are on YouTube right now on my feed page
if i want to go to my menu all i have to
do is swipe over to the left kind of
like you would on the android version i
mean exactly i do what I'm android
version I'm you can see your categories
for YouTube right here if we were to
sign in you would see all your channels
right over here let's go ahead and tap
into settings so you guys can see what
you guys can do so you did make your
home feed be whatever you want like
uploads only or highlights you could
have you know save search filtering all
that good stuff that you would normally
expect if you actually watch a video so
let's go ahead and watch a video really
quick so watch you know what we'll do a
search for phone book so you search you
search for the voice or you could type
i'll hit search my typing i'll tap on a
video really quick
and you can see it can be playing go
ahead and pause that and you can see the
descriptions right over here you hit
suggested and you have basically related
videos go to comments could read the
comments that you have over here and
also you kid add a comment cool things
you can be watching the video while
you're doing that from here you can
subscribe as well so if you haven't
subscribe to phone buff please do that
now because I'm be doing a lot of videos
like this into the future and hoping to
compare this anyway enough of my little
advertisement you could thumbs up and
thumbs down the video from right here
and also you can share it on google+
twitter facebook email etc and you can
do a whole bunch of other options you
can see here like watch later as
favourites add to playlist flag so
pretty cool options that we have here we
go back to the search and hit settings
you can see I can actually have a whole
bunch of search options so you search
you know between the relevance or upload
date you can choose between how long the
videos etc so overall I like the YouTube
app a lot more now I mean I wasn't happy
with the YouTube app on iOS like i said
before but it's really cool now you i
like the fact that i'm able to go in
here of course you get fast forward and
rewind you go fullscreen if you tilt the
phone over I'm on the iPad so I don't
feel like doing that because it won't
fit into my camera's viewfinder but
anyway that's pretty much it for the
youtube app i'll go ahead and show you
guys what it looks like on android you
guys aren't familiar so that way gets to
see looks pretty much the same so let's
go to unlock the sky so here here's the
nexus 7 you can see my trending videos
if I swipe over to the left I get all
the categories just like it did on the
iOS version I'm actually signed in here
so you can see some channels and
subscribe to and far to go to settings
pretty much the same stuff so pretty
cool um anyways that's it from me and
this review if you found it helpful
please hit the thumbs up button and
subscribe to the channel like I said
earlier um thank you for watching the
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
