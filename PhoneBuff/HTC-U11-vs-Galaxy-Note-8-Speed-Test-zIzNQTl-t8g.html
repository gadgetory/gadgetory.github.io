have another Android versus Android
speed test in the all-new HTC u 11 plus
versus the Galaxy Note 8 now taking a
look at the spec sheet these two phones
are very similar they both have the
snapdragon 835 processor they both have
6 gigabytes of RAM and they both use ufs
2.1 storage so this be test is gonna
come down to software optimization will
Samsung continue the good little run is
had here on the channel beating phones
like the iPhone 10 and the LGB 30 or
will the you level + beat the node aides
and become the new number one contender
to later go up against the 1 + 5 t let's
find out
tunnel bear is the easy to use privacy
app that helps you browse the Internet
in up to 20 countries to Tritonal bear
for free go to Tunnel bear comm slash
phone buff or click on that link down
below
alright you know the drill will get
things going by starting the stopwatch
is on each phone and then immediately
take that first selfie where the note 8
is able to get the step over the you 11
+ finishing up with settings and moving
on to Facebook where once again it's
able to load the app at a faster rate
but here in snapchat the 11 plus is able
to cut down on a no dates lead and in
Photoshop it completely erases it so
both bounds are neck-and-neck going into
premiere where the 11 plus is actually
able to take the lead let's see if the
note a can make up some ground here
while each phone exports the same exact
clip and up no the each exported that
clip at a similar rate along the you 11
+ to hold on to its lead as both phones
move on to the gaming row so at the
halfway point here in the first lap this
thing can still go either way
I mean the lead that au 11 + has over
the no dates isn't really all that big
with the no dates still hanging in there
being just a half step behind so if the
u 11 + actually wants to win this thing
beyond the three-second margin of error
is gonna need to create some real
separation here in the first lap and it
looks like it did just that and fit the
fat loading the game up at a
significantly faster rates finally
improving on its lead as both phones
start working on bullet force where the
Galaxy Note 8 does seem to be struggling
a bit along the u 11 + to pull even
further ahead with it now being a full
app in front of
note 8 as it finishes up with ESPN and
moves on to Netflix so at this point
it's pretty clear that the no dates
won't be making a comeback here in this
first lab as the you 11 plus clocks in
an impressive time of 1 minute and 21
seconds putting it up there with the 1 +
5 t as the note 8 finishes up with the
last leg of the first slap coming in 10
seconds later with a time of 1 minute
and 31 which makes the 11 plus failing
to keep one of these apps open here in
the second lap the only hope for the
node 8 to make it come back and get the
W but that doesn't happen with the u 11
plus keeping all the apps ready to go as
it snaps that final selfie on its way to
completing the test with a total time of
1 minute and 47 seconds with those
fast-forwarding the node 8 to the finish
line where it came in 13 seconds later
with the time of two minutes flat making
the winner
the HTC u 11 plus now before we take a
look at the breakdown of the individual
app load of times from the first lab I
want to give a big thanks to Tuttle bear
for sponsoring today's video
so Tunnel bear lets you securely browse
a more open Internet they encrypt your
web traffic so it's harder for
advertisers and like ISPs to track your
activity and it's super easy to use all
you have to do is open the app select
the country that you want to browse from
and Tunnel bear will securely tunnel you
to that country hiding your IP address
with servers in 20 countries you can
always get a fast connection and browse
just like a local hate elevator
subscription makes a great gift for
yourself or for like the privacy concern
person in your life so try for free by
visiting Tunnel better calm slash phone
buff or by clicking on that link down
below in the description all right as
promised here are the individual app
load of times from the first slap where
the you 11 plus put the smack down on
the node 8 loading every single app
except for two at a faster rates which
explains why it was able to win by such
a big margin anyways that is it for me
in this video thank you guys for
watching and as always I'll see you in
the very next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
