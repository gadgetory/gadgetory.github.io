booths calm and today we'll be doing a
quick video on how to multitask on
Windows Phone the basis of multitasking
on Windows Phone are you press the start
key or the HOME key when you want to
exit out of the screen and then to
access your recent apps you can do up to
five apps so you can multi-task with
five apps you're going to press and hold
the back key when you press and hold it
you can see my recent apps that i have
opened and it's like I said up to five
if you actually tap back though like
I'll do the calculator if you tap back
it'll close it out solvent press and
hold it on here and you can see that
calculator is no longer in my list so if
you're trying to multitask on purpose
make sure you don't tap back instead
press the HOME key so a shorty example
of where multitasking would you know be
important is I've entered some random
numbers here and let's say you want to
calculate it so I'm in a microsoft
office but want to go in and out of my
calculator to add these up if I were to
press back it closed it out but what i
could do is go to calculator so the
first number i think was 15 and I kid
press and hold back right from the app I
don't have to go to my home screen and
kind of peek over now I could open this
up if I wanted to get a bigger view but
actually I could actually see the
numbers it's 57 and 99 so let's say I
wanted to add them and it's 171 and I
could actually jump right back in to
here and you know enter my answer so
multitasking obviously is you know very
useful but just remember n is everyone
multitask press this key to minimize the
app instead of closing it with the back
key but that's pretty much it thank you

Goff com don't forget to visit fumble
