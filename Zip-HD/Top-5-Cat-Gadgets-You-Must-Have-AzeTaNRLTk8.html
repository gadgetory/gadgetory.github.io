now you don't have to introducing kitty
Oh a revolutionary new product that
allows you to watch speak to record play
with and even dispense treats to your
cat all from your smartphone hi
Kickstarter I want to tell you about the
inspiration for kitty oh I was cat
sitting for my friend's cat Pasha and we
were having a blast playing with the
laser pointer at the same time his mom
was texting me constantly asking for
updates and photos and video and that's
when it occurred to me why should the VA
for pet parents to play with their cats
when I'm not at home when I first heard
about kitty oh I was really excited
about it I knew it would be a product
that pet owners would love it's a great
idea your cat can have fun you can have
fun what we wanted to achieve with
designing the kitty Oh was taking
something that has a lot of features but
from a user's point of view we wanted to
make it as simple as possible when the
prototype of kitty Oh was finally
created I realized that all the effort
that went into the development had
really paid off it's gonna look great in
anybody's home the setup process of
starting up the kitty o devices is
fairly simple take it out of the box
connected to Wi-Fi and you're ready to
start playing with your pet with the app
on your phone you're able to see what
this unit at home is seeing they'll let
you check out what I'm using a camera
and it lets you interact with them using
the laser and the tree dispenser the
kitty o treat dispenser was designed
with seven compartments you can deliver
treats multiple times a day or over an
entire week we even came up with a shelf
mount so if you're curious can't it
wouldn't knock it over inadvertently
some of the other key benefits for
having a kitty o could be just increased
stimulation for the cat there's a fair
amount of overweight cats so maybe we
can get them playing more I feel like a
cat owner the first time they operate
their kitty o is going to be so excited
about the opportunity to play with their
cat from anywhere in the world I could
definitely see myself wanting this and
you know people I know wanting it my mom
would love this my mom would buy this I
think it's gonna create a whole new way
of
being a pet owner being a cat owner it's
going to be incredible fun all around
can you imagine never having to scoop a
litter box again with the litter loo
it's possible the litter loo is the only
sifting litter box that has a
cat-friendly open design to a cat
it pretty much appears like a regular
litter box unlike the dark and closed
litter boxes you should have no problem
getting your cat used to the litter loop
the secret to the litter loop is that it
holds a very large amount of litter this
litter area is larger than all existing
automated litter boxes on the market
today
the patented drip cap forces urine away
from the side of the litter pan to
prevent clumps from sticking attached to
this litter pan is the sifting Tower
which is used to hold filtered litter a
screen is mounted on the bottom of the
sifting Tower to prevent waste material
from entering the tower it has a sensor
so it knows when your cat is in it seven
minutes after your cat has left the
litter box it starts to move its slowly
and quietly so as not to startle or
frighten your cat the litter is sifted
using gravity you can use any brand of
inexpensive clumping litter as the
litter loose cycles litter is very
gently rolled toward the sifting tower
two minutes later a nice clean litter
box for your cat the waste is stored in
a tightly sealed drawer under the litter
box empty once or twice a week normal
maintenance consists of adding litter
whenever you empty the waste drawer and
wiping off the drip cap and the sifting
tower with a damp paper towel that's it
once or twice a year you can lift off
the entire top of the unit which
contains no electronics take it outdoors
and clean it with the garden hose your
cat will love it and you will too
we love our cats but we hate dealing
with their litter boxes and they're
hardly user-friendly I mean your choice
is either the box with the scoop or some
expensive contraption that still needs
to be emptied but there is a better way
introducing the loop litter box here's
how it works
to clean the litter box just lift the
top tray and the waste is separated from
the clean litter turn the tray 180
degrees place it at the bottom of the
stack and that's it cleaning your litter
box takes seconds with no mess or hassle
what makes loop better three identical
slotted trays individually each tray
acts as a sift but when any two are
stacked together they form a solid tray
add the third tray and they create a
perpetual sifting loop you'll never have
to scoop again no more wasting cat
litter simply top it up from time to
time
we love our cat
