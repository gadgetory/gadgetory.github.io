feel to your picking hand and thanks to
advances with Bluetooth 4.0 technology

Tools and other deities I created the
jam stack because I felt like the
process of playing the electric guitar
was in fact there were things I just
couldn't do easily from playing wherever
I wanted to to getting going with
effects and recording right when I felt
inspired
four years ago I set out on the journey
to create a more compelling guitar
playing experience well our team has
done it and now we're ready to bring it
to you meet the James act the world's
first attachable guitar amp and also the
first integrates seamlessly with your
smartphone our priorities would create
the best all-around guitar playing
experience as possible prioritizing the
absolute best tone at practice volumes
and complete and total portability the
jam stack allows you to play the
electric guitar anywhere by leveraging
the awesome power of your smart phone
and super lightweight speaker technology
in the past acoustic instruments were
the ultimate and portability being the
only real option for travel or playing
outside the jam stacks 10 watts of power
easily outperforms acoustic guitars and
hand drum you can be a unique part to
any outdoor transmission in fact your
guitar and your amplifier can fit easily
in the same case as well as being
uncompromising the portable it's also
the fastest way to play the electric
guitar with layered effects at any price
point James tech snaps on to the back of
any standard electric guitar body using
the existing strap button unless you
have something like a Flying V the jam
stack can be attached with one hand in
under three seconds we designed the
James Tague to work with all major
smartphones including iOS Android and
Windows phones as well as the iPod Touch
we have the opportunity to free the
electric guitar and bring it out into
the world in a way that has never been
possible before we just need your help
to make it a reality
I created the jam stack because being an
electric guitar player was part of who I
was now I'm thrilled I can carry that
with me anyway
okay so we invented it you kind of
guitar except people can learn to play
in a matter of it
only around 10% of the population plays
a musical instrument but 80% wishes they
could our guitar has strings for
strumming and finger picking just like a
traditional guitar but instead of
strings going up the fretboard we have
but all you have to do is use a single
touch play entire chords our mobile app
can display the song for you with the
lyrics and the court numbers did you get
started like right away our vision is to
see a lot more people sing playing and
making music together bad no no
the guitar had the built-in speaker so
you can just grab it and go play or you
can even turn the speaker down and play
through your headphones you're not
disturbing anyone if you ever wish that
you could be musically expressive by the
way put this instrument
now you can this is spread Zeppelin fret
Zeppelin is a state of the art led
addition to your guitar it fits just
above the frets and shows you exactly
where to put your fingers to play
anything you can imagine let's take a
look at how learning to play guitar
usually turns out you head to your local
music store and pick out a guitar it's
beautiful you love it and you couldn't
be more excited to get started you get
home and immediately try to play
something you're prepared you have your
book tablature online videos websites
everything or so it seems
after hours of dedicated attention the
frustration sets in you've done
everything right what's wrong the
problem is simple human nature you
naturally want to be shown exactly what
to do so that's what we did add a fret
Zeppelin to your guitar and it shows you
exactly where to put your fingers so all
you have to do is strum or pick it
cannot be any simpler use the smartphone
app to select what you'd like to play
and you're instantly ready to rock
you can display chords note scales and
any key and of course any light show you
can imagine for those fun times or use
AI mode to have the next finger location
displayed automatically after you strum
LED technology has only recently
progressed enough to make fret
Zeppelin's possible fret Zeppelin is
only half the height of your guitars
breath that means there will be
absolutely no interference with the
strings or your hand as you play fret
Zeppelin was engineered with musicians
in mind
you picked a playing style and fret
Zeppelin teaches you the connections
between each fret are on the top side of
the guitar where your hand doesn't slide
but even if you get into some advanced
playing techniques the sleek coding
seamlessly aligns with your guitar neck
so it isn't noticed
fretts Epson lets you learn guitar fast
and intuitively whether you're a
first-time player or experienced fret
Zeppelin works for anyone with any
guitar what's next is up to you
Jax the first wireless guitar lead that
works over Wi-Fi setup is simple press
the button to switch it on and then plug
it into your guitar you see that it
articulates to fit any guitar type i've
already plugged another jack into the
guitar amp ready to go the jack allows
for real-time streaming over a secure
Wi-Fi connection
it delivers studio quality sound better
than CD with ultra-low latency for
real-time playback with no need for a
Ritter or internet connection you could
use this setup at the top of a mountain
so no cables no audio interfaces just
crystal clear sound and it's not just
for amps download the Jack app and
without any other hardware you can
connect to any Wi-Fi enabled device your
PC tablet or phone
I want to send the computer you can do
what you like with it
record it edit it upload it anything you
want if you don't know jack it's about
time you did
there are three ways to hold the guitar
trailer
of new techniques and effects the chord
position allows you to strike trill and
roll on all six strings at once the lead
position allows you to play one or two
strings at a time by trilling harping or
harmonic tabbing the pig position allows
you to pick tap slide or pinch you can
easily switch between positions to
combine these techniques and unique and
creative ways there's obviously a
variety of ways that you can play it I
think all genres can play with this the
guitar chillin is great for every type
of guitar player this incredible
handheld tool can be used on bass
acoustic electric guitar or any threaded
instrument and the new sounds that it
creates can be incorporated into any
style of music we've spent the last few
years tweaking and perfecting the guitar
trailer so that every element performs
with precision the weight length and
shape have all been carefully calibrated
and meticulously crafted for maximum
recoil optimum motion and an ergonomic
design every prototype along the way has
been tested and improved upon and now we
have the perfect guitar trailer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
