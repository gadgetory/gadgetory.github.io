Kaiser original I like those heavy bulky
fold up chairs the Kaiser is extremely
comfortable a snap set up and use and
folds up in a small lightweight bag so
it's super easy to carry since the
Kaiser is so strong and durable you'll
be able to relax at all sorts of places
but even rough terrain it's great for
those long hiking trips hanging out at
the beach in the park to sunbathe in
your backyard and of course at your
favorite outdoor festival also if you
enjoy meeting interesting new people
you'll love Kaiser because it's a
magnetic conversation starter Tyson will
truly make you feel like a king the
Kaiser is made with the strongest super
lightweight parachute battery
has a stretch pocket on the side so you
don't have to put your drink on the
ground and on the other side there's a
double pocket so you can conveniently
store all of your books later and fall
we've also included a small boot to
securely scape your kaiser to the ground
and of course it comes equipped with a
bottle opener for those relaxing
barbecues in the summer time and it even
floats on water so you can even use it
to chill in the pool
