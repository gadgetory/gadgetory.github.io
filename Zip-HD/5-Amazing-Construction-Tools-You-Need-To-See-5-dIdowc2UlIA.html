advantages of airless spraying with the
easy touch-up and minimal prep time of
rolling is Graco's jet roller it can be
used for virtually all paints including
interior and exterior latex and
oil-based primers and finish coats the
jet roller is uniquely designed as three
tools and one it's easy to set up right
out of the box just connect the two
extensions tighten the fittings with two
wrenches then adjust the extension at
the swivel to align the handle to a
comfortable position with the roller
head the jet roller system includes an
inline gun with a replaceable filter in
the handle a 20 inch extension an
adjustable roller handle which fits your
favorite off-the-shelf nine inch roller
covers the patented clean shot valve an
adjustable spring-loaded valve which
helps eliminate spits and drips from
pressure buildup in the extension a
spray guard and 7:21 tip always set up
your airless sprayer according to its
manual to minimize overspray adjust the
pressure to about 1000 psi if you don't
have a pressure gauge on your sprayer
set the pressure knob about one-third of
the way out a little bit of tailing is
okay since you're back rolling as you
spray to minimize overspray even further
set the angle of the spray head to apply
on the wall just below the roller as you
jet roll down the wall much of the
remaining overspray is captured by the
roller low
Spray and speed of the primary
advantages of generally and minimal
overspray means minimal prep time make
sure you're spraying on the wall just
beneath the roller adjust the handle to
match the spray fan to the roller width
when held perpendicular to the wall to
accommodate different materials the
handle moves back and forth to change
the width simply spray and roll on the
downstroke and only roll on the upstroke
you can stop spraying a foot or two
above the floor and continue rolling
down to avoid spraying the floor or trim
the spray extension also allows you to
spray corners to avoid some of the
cutting end that is normally required
with a brush to avoid spraying the
roller angle the spray head away from
the roller spray the corner readjust the
spray head and continue jet rolling
if the roller gets too loaded with paint
simply roll it up jedd rolling is
typically twice as fast as traditional
dipping and rolling and for spraying
back roll jobs you won't be the second
person the 18 inch adjustable version is
available as just the handle or as a
complete system the handle is
interchangeable with the 9 inch version
the 18 inch jet roller is used for
larger areas and adjusts to hold 12 18
and 14 inch roller covers it has the
identical set up to the 9 inch with one
difference when changing roller cover
widths remember to Center the roller on
the spray tip using the guides on the
frame the 18 inch system shipped with a
12 23 wide angle tip rico's jet roller
system is an innovative tool that will
make your jobs easier much faster and
fun onsite roofing jobs are dangerous
one of the more hazardous jobs is
getting material onto the roof the most
basic approach is manually carrying the
items while climbing a ladder
this approach is labor-intensive and
contrary to OSHA three points of contact
regulations resulting in large fines if
caught
but more importantly potential Falls can
result in significant injuries and in
the extreme death to you or your
co-workers a boom mounted flatbed truck
requires more space than is often
available and the truck is notorious for
causing property damage as well as being
expensive to rent the boom is efficient
at lifting material but often is not
available when needed plus they may
place the material convenient to the
operator but not actually where the
roofer needs it so the material requires
reposition once on the roof roofing
conveyors have all the drawbacks of boom
trucks they are effective but are
expensive and awkward to move around
smaller sites the solution for the small
to medium size jobs safety hoist the
features of our safety hoists are they
are durable yet lightweight which makes
them easily portable allowing them to be
moved to where the material actually
needs to go they are simple to operate
require very little training and allow
for one-man operation they are safe OSHA
compliant but best of all are affordable
costing a fraction of other automated
approaches the safety hoist is ideal for
moving shingles metal roofing sections
felt insulation plywood solar panels etc
no special tools are required for
assembly or operation the units are
field repairable in minutes not hours at
off-site repair facilities they meet
OSHA standards and can lift loads of up
to 400 pounds in seconds all at a
reasonable affordable cost the safety
hoist currently comes in three models
the workhorse MH 123 with a 200 pound
capacity the CH 200 which has the same
200 pound capacity but with a more
rugged design for the more frequent user
or for a larger operation the HD 400
which boasts a 400 pound capacity and
soon to arrive a 300 pound hoist the VH
300 is currently undergoing field tests
with our standard package you will
receive three eight-foot sections of
track with splice plates a three-foot
base with carriage assembly and your
choice of a Briggs and Stratton
or Honda gas engine or an electric motor
the standard unit provides for a height
of 27 feet by purchasing additional
eight-foot sections the height can be
raised in intervals up to 43 feet the
safety hoist is ideal for moving
material onto hard-to-reach areas and is
perfect for highly pitched Drew's moving
materials away from the edge of the roof
allows for increased efficiency and
safety to help do this safety hoist
offers its unique unloading ramp which
allows materials to be discharged safely
away from the edge of the roof and our
unique custom-built support brace
provides for extra ladder support for
longer ladder lengths finally safety
hoist offers a full one-year warranty
reduce the risk of injury eliminate the
cost of expensive boom trucks make more
money by saving time and effort with the
safety hoist as essential is a hammer a
screwdriver or a wrench
