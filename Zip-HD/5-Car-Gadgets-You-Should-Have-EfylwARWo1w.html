hello Adam
hello again Nazi doctors loud sound to
early bird cafe
you and me we're busy people and being
busy means checking your phone even when
you're not supposed to even when you're
on the road but now there's Maggie hold
on I gotta get this Katie
dr. Lee hey Adam quick reminder first
thing today about coffee with Connie and
Gregg got the earlybird party on my way
he was brilliant about navdy is it after
route they'll automatically rerouting to
save ten minute perfect
that'll been this way before let's
switch to Navi - you were so brilliant
about Navi is its display is focused
into distance so your eyes are never off
the road it's also 40 times brighter
than your smartphone rims automatically
so it's you be this day or night in fact
it was re going to take coaching - Greg
and I actually want to do web cafe ad on
52 smiley face Oh awesome
luckily Lloyd is one of my favorites
Nabby uses Google Maps and built-in
offline map you'll never get lost like
out here in the desert and it's
connected to your car which means this
one guy rerouting to nearest gas station
sex Johnny be there in to see you have
around thanks Navi see you soon
finding parking in the city can be hard
and week orders only give you a few
minutes time to meet hot add an
expensive parking ticket on top of that
and you're going to have that day
how great would it be if our phones
could help us avoid things like this a
where car in the free app for iOS and
Android devices that makes your
smartphone contextually aware of your
car all you need is this device just put
in your glove box
and forget about it the battery lasts
more than here you can open apps as you
approach drive and leave the car
when you approach your car a wear car
will even show Google Maps on the
lockscreen for single swipe launch if
you're in a hurry a wear car can easily
find where your last barks you don't
have to do anything it happens
automatically if you're parked in a
metered spot a wear car automatically
ask you to enter the amount of time that
you paid for plus when you're too far to
walk back to your car before the time is
up
we have alerts you
a ten dollar investment to avoid
expensive parking ticket make a lot of
things we want to make your phone aware
of its current context unlike other
approaches that involve continuously
collecting data monitoring or tracking
users we've designed an elegant solution
using a simple device this device uses
micro location events to let us know
what context you're in and so you
haven't opened a poll and open apps
manually what if your phone
automatically experiments actions based
on your environment and content which
this device uses low-energy Bluetooth
which means your phone has a negligible
power consumption even when the app is
running in the background the device is
almost ready however it lacks the
contextual intelligence that we need you
can control this device turning it on or
off once you turn it off your phone is
no longer aware of its environment
context awareness is more than just
micro location micro location provides
events based on users moving in and out
of small spaces we're building a
software stack on top of micro location
events that provides context awareness
we're calling it aware stack the first
use case where it Sakhalin is the car we
hope to make something really useful for
users in a where car and to learn from
the experience eventually we'd like to
open up aware stack to developers as
well here's why the media support we
have configured the hardware correctly
and are right now calibrating the signal
strength to work with the car you can
flawlessly we are working to optimize
the battery life for the device and for
your phone we want to make sure that it
works flawlessly even when in the glove
box of your car
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
