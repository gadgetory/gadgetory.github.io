does a head strong and rugged I really
like it I like the chance the icy breeze
portable air conditioner is innovation
that will truly change the way you beat
the heat from the outside it looks like
a sleek user-friendly ice chest and in
fact it is but it's what's on the inside
that makes it an icy breeze like any
cooler food and beverages stay cool in
the ice but if you add just a few quarts
of water the ice will actually transform
this dual purpose unit into a portable
air conditioner inside the chest is a
pump that circulates the ice-cold water
through a condensing unit and then blows
ice cold dry air through a vent or the
commute with flexi hub the rechargeable
self-contained battery system will keep
you cool for up to seven hours on a low
setting the multi speed internal fan and
the flexi hose let you control the
direction and the power of your breeze

25 miles an hour and 30 degrees cooler
than ambient temperatures this portable
air conditioner contains no freon so as
long as the battery is fully charged or
if you have access to 110 volts
electricity all you need is ice and a
little water when you're finished all
you do is pop the drain plug and pour
out the contents the durable
construction make this the perfect
companion for almost any setting where
