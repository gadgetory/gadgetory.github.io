years we've kick-started for products
that expand your camera's capabilities
and now we've built the best remote
trigger we can imagine this is pulse the
most powerful way to control your camera
from your smug
also lets you take a photo without
having to touch or shake your camera so
you can get sharp images in any
conditions or capture moments where you
can't be next to your camera but pulse
isn't just a trigger it gives you all
the functionality you expect from
shooting with your DSLR for mirrorless
camera but remotely from your smartphone
you can change all of your camera
settings through the app or just check
your histogram and make sure everything
is looking good unlike other triggers
pulse lets you start and stop video too
and because you can control up to three
cameras at once you can get all the
right angles for your shot even if you
are just a team of one
pulse is also the most powerful
time-lapse trigger on the market so if
you are taking your very first time
lapse or getting the holy grail of
timelapses a day to night transition
we've designed pulse to give you maximum
control
hercules is the world's smallest
motion-control camera system and allows
anyone to capture stunning cinematic
video footage with virtually any camera
conventional motion control systems
create beautiful shots but they're huge
bulky expensive difficult to use what if
there was a way to have a device that
captured the same type of footage as
those enormous expensive rigs that was
small enough and light enough to fit in
your pocket and take with you anywhere
just like your smartphone what if it was
easy enough to use that anyone from a
professional photographer or
videographer all the way down to someone
whose only experience with photography
is their smartphone could learn to use
it easily and intuitively we took all
those what if questions and answer them
with the hercules
the Hercules easily gets traditional
slider moves
curved moves
motorized dolly shots motion control
timelapses
automated panoramas
all in the palm of your hand the
Hercules is incredibly tough
the Hercules is durable and living up to
its name the Hercules is strong able to
support pretty much any camera out there
from the smallest action cam smartphone
DSLR all the way up to a full-size
motion picture camera the Hercules can
go from being in your pocket to being
assembled program and shooting within 30
seconds the Hercules on its own is
incredibly versatile and can be used
almost anywhere with the optional rail
you can use it as a traditional slider
or elevated shots
or for even more dynamic moves
it's easily programmable with a single
button we won't have the hercules to be
small and we also wanted to make sure
that it wouldn't require some
specialized for chargeable battery that
would be difficult to find in a pinch so
it runs off of a single triple a battery
the Hercules was designed through the
collaboration of electrical engineers
robotics designers software developers
and filmmakers the Hercules is
manufactured using the highest quality
materials and state-of-the-art equipment
the Hercules is not vaporware this is
not something that has yet to be
designed or tested or built it's here
today ready to go
in 2008 we had the vision to restart the
production of analog instant film and
now we are producing these films here in
NCAA Holland in the former Polaroid
factory my favorite Polaroid camera is
the legendary essex 70 nevertheless most
of my pictures i take with my iphone my
problem is that there is no way to
convert these digital images into the
real analog instant photos i love so
much together with the team of
passionate people we found a way to make
it work
I proudly present you the first working
prototype of our impossible instant lab
and here is how it works first extended
our launch the impossible app select an
image start the timer and place the
iphone in the cradle open the shutter
wait for the signal let the exposure is
finished close the shutter push the
button and enjoy how an digital image
develops is a beautiful real photo in
your hands
the quick draw is a very innovative way
to get your glass out of your bag and
into action it's worn around your waist
and utilizes the bayonet mount to hold
multiple SLR lenses the idea is to keep
your camera in one hand and change
lenses with the other so photographers
let me ask you a question how do you
handle your glass during issue are you a
slinger slingers are observed to carry
multiple camera bodies wherever they go
they're constantly matching settings
between cameras or are you a stasher
stashes hide their glass like a dog with
a bone stashes run the risk of
forgetting where they left their
valuable assets or even worse losing are
you a commander commanders rely on their
assistance for lens changes they are
often seen bossing their assistant
around to try to keep up with their
creative style of shooting or are you a
bagger baggers carry a hundred percent
of their gear with them like they're
boarding there there will always be a
few zippers in the way fast lens changes
or you a gunner here's how the
quick-draw system works remove the lens
you're finished shooting with locate an
open quick-draw insert the lens just
like you would a camera and let go grab
your next lens reverse the process and
go with the quick-draw you can keep your
camera settings and attachments leave
your backup camera in your bag get your
own glass within five seconds to get the
ultimate variety of shots
lighten your load and get your glass out
of your bag and into action keep your
creative assets around your waist quit
hiding your glass and start showing it
off stop fussing with back caps lens
caps and light hoods to store your glass
for later keep your glass ready to shoot
and get to it with one hand
congratulations you've just received
your new camera and you're all ready to
go out and shoot great pictures but have
you given any thought to how you'll
protect your camera from scratches and
impact not so comfortable i if you were
a professional photographer you choose
this solution but you don't really need
all that do you all you need is
something to help you carry your camera
and protect it meet me go your camera's
best amigo amigo is a whole new concept
of camera carrier that gives you a
better photography experience in
different shooting situations me go is
offered in two versions and a range of
stylish colors it comes in two sizes to
fit either a midsize DSLR or a
mirrorless camera strap and wrap is a
padded strap which lets you carry your
camera comfortably while protecting it
from scratches and impact
Griffin rap is a padded grip which lets
you secure your camera comfortably on
your wrist and when you're done shooting
me go changes from a padded strap or a
secure grip into a protective cover for
your camera and here's the really cool
part with me go you don't really need a
camera bag you just wrap me go around
your camera and put it in your day back
