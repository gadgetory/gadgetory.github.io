what if you could draw things exactly as
you imagined what if you could lift your
pen off the paper and create real
objects the 3doodler is the world's
first and only 3d drawing pen it's been
designed to be compact and easy to use
no software no computers you just plug
it in and can start drawing anything
with in minutes
the beauty of 3doodler is how simple it
is everyone knows how to use a pen so we
designed a 3d printing pen if you can
scribble trace or wave a finger in the
air you can use a 3doodler to create
simple or complex objects and we're
making 3d creation accessible to
everyone
a 3doodler is the most affordable way
through heat printing so how does it
work 3doodler uses cutting-edge
patent-pending technology to heat and
cool plastic as it passes through the
body of the pen just like a 3d printer
plastic cools rapidly and becomes hard
the possibilities are endless including
3d models jewelry decorative art toys
fridge magnets or a scale model of the
Eiffel Tower it can even be used for
basic repairs 3doodler represents a
whole new medium for artists makers 3d
enthusiasts in fact anyone wanting to
express their creative side
unlike other 3d printing pens on the
market poly s utilizes light curing
technology photosensitive polymers are
exposed to ultraviolet light at the same
time this allows the poly s to avoid
disadvantages found in other printing
pens that use abs or PLA materials we
have completely eliminated all high
temperature parts so that drying no
longer means having to work with high
temperature 500 degrees Celsius tools
our goal is to provide users with the
safest experience possible we believe
that one point two inches is the ideal
diameter for hand operated tools this
provides users with the greatest degree
of control when holding the tool with
one hand from the LED battery indicator
and ink level port to the Pens elegantly
designed concave pen tip every aspect of
the poly s has been designed with the
needs of everyday users in mind so that
drawing is an enjoyable experience the
world should be colorful paulius is
beautiful exterior should convince to
paly yes say yes to a polychrome world
poly s is not only car from the outside
its filled with color you can mix and
match inks in every color of the rainbow
we also have Santa thinks X is a
transparent glow in the dark ink so
change colors with different
temperatures and many other fun options
poly essence wide variety of inks
provide users with a feast for the
senses that goes beyond just 3d the most
colorful pen is also the safest blue LED
developed exclusively by Future made can
be solidified using lights from the
normal visible spectrum which makes poly
s safer for children to use the nanny
other 3d printing pin our researchers
put significant effort into developing
blue LED technology which was recently
awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics this
technology can achieve the same
solidification effect as ultraviolet
light but without any danger to eyes
in addition the poly s with a tilt
sensor and safety switch which is not
only a technical improvement but also a
way to make sure that the poly s is
completely safe for child use
this then is the technology that touches
the peak of professionalism all existing
3d pens large heavy uncomfortable and
uneasy to use leaks is designed to offer
an entirely new experience to all the
creative people
the enhanced dimensional features of
leaks help them to come up with
something unique and interesting lit has
a great potential and can be a perfect
tool for stylists architects designers
and anybody who are interested in 3d
printing in short weeks as everything
and experimental needs the small device
will allow you to go beyond your
imagination Lix 3d printing pan is for
you if you love to experiment
differently it will open new
possibilities in your credit if you are
stepping into your profession in a
