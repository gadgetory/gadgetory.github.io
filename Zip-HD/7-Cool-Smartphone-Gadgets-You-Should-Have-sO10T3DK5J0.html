they function as our camera our GPS our
flashlights and even as our entire
computer app developers do their best to
make user interface as simple and
intuitive as possible to play music roll
your eyes message sent to mom but
sometimes it's easier to manage things
with a physical controller meet nimi and
Busey the inventors of pressing a new
way to control and automate your
everyday smartphone actions
Pressey is a tiny physical button that
connects to your headphone jack and
sends unique signals to an intuitive app
that can activate one of many commands
here are some of the many things you can
do with your press e take instant photos
and upload them to your favorite social
network turn on your LED light send your
location for emergencies start a
discreet tape recording don't tell
anyone but I like bears check into your
favorite social network and much more
pressing is not just a one-trick pony
you can easily configure the Pressy app
to execute different actions for
different sequences of clicks for
example two short clicks can call your
mom and two long clicks can call your
dad but what if you want to use your
headphones just let press e rest in the
special key chain and use the headphone
button as pressing it all still works
press E even has an API so developers
can bring you more cool features this is
where Nemean Busey asked for your help
press e needs your love 2,000 people
support press e and order one Mimi and
Busey will be able to mass-produce press
e press e the almighty button
you
this is snap tip without switching to a
custom app just place your phone on top
and press print a few seconds later
you'll have a beautiful Polaroid photo
of your phone screen snapjet is a slim
portable instant film printer for your
smartphone it's like a tiny photocopy
machine you can bring anywhere the best
thing about snapjet is its simplicity
all you need to do is put your phone on
top press one button and you get a
flawless photo
it doesn't need any apps wires or
Bluetooth to function with snapchat the
possibilities are endless if you can see
it you can print it imagine a birthday
card with a selfie that was taken 30
seconds ago or what about printing a
custom business card at your next
meeting snapchats text is sharp and
clear never be caught with an outdated
business card again and next time
instead of running a giant expensive
photo booth for your special occasion
why not use a snapchat instead snapchat
prints on Fuji Instax or polaroid 300
film and its innovative design can
support any smartphone Polaroid is near
and dear to my heart as a photographer I
was just really excited about working
with instant film again and I loved that
snapchat was incorporating the use of a
smart phone because it's just so
convenient to take photos we wanted
something that pushed the limits of
what's possible with instant film like
digital effects fluorescent ink a pocket
video that doesn't require a single
battery lenticular film and
transparencies that come to life with an
Arduino and some simple LEDs we're
actually really excited to see what
people make with snapchat and where it's
used
coming increasingly powerful and more
useful every day we live in incredible
times where smartphones enable us to
work but stay connected and share
experiences from anywhere in the world

whatever happened to the days in Mobile
when companies were constantly pushing
the boundaries of innovation and design
putting out products so where sometimes
even considered wacky we needed to
design a device that was not only an
incredible phone but also an amazing
wearable I used to repair a lot of
phones I had crack screens or water
damaged and did it quite frequently and
when I took apart a lot of these phones
I noticed that a lot of the brand's
shared similar construction and design
techniques and oftentimes used materials
that were obsolete like screws and using
rigid and fragile materials like glass
and even steel and thought to myself
there had to be a better way we first
started with a lot of different types of
concepts and designs and after a lot of
iterations and testing and vetting we
really kind of narrowed it down to two
designs which was a large and a small
before you knew that the portal was born
we needed to ensure that it was not only
waterproof but also flexible
shatterproof and where we needed to
build a team of incredible people with
the wide range of skill sets who are all
unified to pursue our mission and break
the mold in the mobile market the
problem with the mobile market right now
is that the phones are all the same and
what little differentiation they have is
that some are less user-friendly and
some are less durable things like this
still happen so we're here to change
that with the vibrant pallets clean
typography and easy to understand icon
set the portal UI it was experience it
cannot be missed while be stuck with the
same old design when you've got a new
refreshing interface to play with an
interface that helps you interact that
knows what you want and works with you
in the way that you want it to work the
portal not only has all the features you
would expect such as Wi-Fi Bluetooth and
NFC but also has a waterproof Kevlar
infuse polyurethane body a six inch
flexible display wireless charging and
unlock network and so much more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
