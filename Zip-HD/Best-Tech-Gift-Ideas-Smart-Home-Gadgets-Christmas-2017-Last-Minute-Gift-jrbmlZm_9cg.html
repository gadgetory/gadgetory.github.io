pretty handy

no replacing sesame has a patented
design that fits any latch anywhere in
the world

nearby so if sesame is always on my home
network and it's linked to the access
point with Bluetooth which keeps it
connected while going easy on the
batteries and with no keys it's easy to
let other people in to
