yet accessible 3d printer with reliable
dual extrusion swappable print cords and
wireless control let's see what makes it
the most industrial grade desktop 3d
printer available the Ultimaker 3 has a
large build volume but this conveniently
on your desk it comes with print cores
for build and support materials there's
a customized nozzle geometry / material
which means reduced risk of clogging and
a more reliable 3d printing experience
it's print core PCB ensures a more
accurate temperature reading and
superior print quality the Ultimaker 3
can print at temperatures as high as 280
degrees Celsius fast print core changes
mean higher uptime and easier
maintenance print core LED lights
intuitively notify you if any user
interaction is required for easy print
removal or to clean the glass plate
simply open the clamp and remove the
plate
leveling the build late is effortless
when you use it for the first time
simply set the right height by turning a
knob while using the Ultimaker
calibration card after that the
Ultimaker threes active leveling does it
automatically the capacitive sensor in
the printhead measures the distance
between the build plate and the nozzle
when starting a print the offset is
compensated by adjusting the Z height in
the first layers this results in more
accurate leveling improved build plate
adhesion and optimize print quality
pre-configured cura profiles provide you
with optimal print settings per material
and intuitively recognize which print
core and material you are using multi
makers range of materials are formulated
to achieve superior print results and
the open filament system lets you
experiment with all kinds of additional
materials to bring your 3d model to life
you'll need to prepare it for print
using cura our free slicer software you
can either stick with the preset or
tinker with the advanced settings

desktop 3d printer on the market with
the Ultimaker 3 professional 3d printing
is made accessible
hello we at a craft unique are very
proud to introduce our newest machine
the craft bought excel as you can see
it's much bigger why do we build the
excel because of demand especially from
our most avid users anywhere from
schools to engineers to prototypers to
architects some people demanded a bigger
print volume the new print volume of the
excel is 20 by 30 by 44 centimeters or
roughly 12 by 8 by 17 inches we have a
new set of nozzles that comes with the
machine we afford new nozzles 0.25 point
four point six and point eight
millimeters and with the smallest nozzle
to 0.25 you can actually print 50
microns per layer another thing I like
to point out the machine are the new
linear rails in our original craft spot
we had a rod bearing system and for the
bigger size with all of our tests we
found that we had more precision and
less noise when we use the rail system
let's discuss the LCD in the cross blot
XL it's the same great touchscreen LCD
as in our other models there's three new
options in the cross what excel in all
of our models with the firmware and
they're very important and I'd like to
discuss those now and that is the
temperature speed and stop start option
that you can use in the middle of a
print and that is something very special
in a ministry being able to go in the
middle of the print and change things
like that and you can find that in all
of our new firmware for all of our
printers I will talk specifically about
the print pause and resume function if
there's a case where you want to change
the filament you can just pause it
change the filament and start right back
up or if there's an emergency or if you
have an appointment or whatever the case
may be with the craft bought you can
actually stop the print and started at a
later point in time if there's a power
outage say all the power goes out you
normally lose your whole print and all
the hours of work you
into it with the craft what the Machine
actually remembers the exact point where
the power outage happened and you can
resume at a later time you can save a
lot of hours by doing this we have a lot
of the same great options that have been
available in our award-winning printers
in the past to discuss some of those the
value of the craft but Excel there's
really nothing in the industry where
you're going to find something of this
quality in this price range it has a
very easy setup has the same
plug-and-play
it has reliability and it has the
durability with the all steel frame
found in all of our craft bought
machines you have the same removable
heat able a build plate which is
something that basically I think you
have to have on a 3d printer nowadays
and another new option that we have is a
built-in counter or what we like to call
a 3d printer odometer and what that does
is it for all you stat people out there
is it actually keeps a record of how
many printing hours you've actually put
into your printer we have the same craft
wear that we've always had we update it
all the time and you can download it
from our website and it is a leader in
speed and visual splendor in the
industry and if you ever have a problem
or any question whatsoever feel free to
contact our customer service because
everybody there is a 3d printing expert
and a crockpot user themselves and they
will get you a quick reply so that's
just about it with our crock-pot XL 3d
printer and I thank you very much for
watching
at dremel we see every day as an
opportunity to learn something new
whether you're an engaged parent a
teacher looking to inspire your class or
just a hands-on DIY er we make the tools
that help make it possible children too
can benefit from these tools such as the
dremel idea builder 3d 40 3d printing
technology encourages creativity and
problem-solving skills giving children
the confidence to turn the power of
their imagination into reality the
Dremel idea builder 3d 40 introduces
students to 3d printing through hands-on
project and problem-based learning
that's both easy and engaging and
convenient features like Wi-Fi printer
connectivity and a new app that lets you
control the printer from both Android
and iOS smartphones make the 3d 40
incredibly user-friendly furthermore the
included Print Studio software and print
ready model will have you up and
building fast and with its new larger
build plate assisted leveling feature
and compatibility with the sprout by HP
3d scanner the 3d 40 gives you the power
and flexibility to expand a child's
creative horizons even further but the
idea builder is more than just safe
reliable and easy to use it's backed by
dremel with all of the friendly
world-class customer support you'd come
to expect we're happy to talk service
software parts troubleshooting or even
share our own idea of other experiences
with you
of course you'll likely find that the
best feature of the idea builder 3d 40
is being able to explore build and learn
together because what you're really
building on future innovators at Dremel
we are committed to developing a family
of 3d printing products that
allow you to build easier make more and
dream big the new dremel idea builder 3
d 4 t let your imagination free I think
this is just the beginning of something
really revolutionary
having a gigawatt here we can introduce
product in a matter of week versus a
matter month and work on the next one
and then the next one my name is Frances
Malek I am a gigawatt career here at
that marketing company our design and
our user ichabod ranges from conceptual
ideas prototyping final iteration to
manufacturing rapid prototyping is
basically having a concept and having it
come to life right a time to be ready to
see in touch with you without 3d
printing basically takes two weeks or
three weeks to give it a working
prototype we're at the tourist having
special with a gigawatt it's here in a
matter of hours
a couple hacks are gigawatt we've set up
our small webcam for remote desktop any
time during the day at night
everybody could log in and actually view
the prints having built the gig apart
from kids and operating it I think it
revolutionizing the way I thought of law
to determine the reliability and quality
is always there we have our moments
maybe they are future visions is to have
a multiple 3d printer printing at once
and have the part ready for our client
keeping your process finished and ready
to be shipped the same day it's very
well known
what's going on here at Downing High
School we're cutting edge I mean we're
college level here when we first got our
new gigawatt it was kind of a mysterious
dealing and we didn't know really what
to expect I've been using it about for
almost a year and a half now I'm here a
lot of the students they see my second
home the kids pick it up and they they
understand it so well they ran into a
problem it was something they caused so
they might not a big fit I just found
myself with online vintage answer is
another PC I go to you had FIRST
Robotics Competition we have a six-week
bill created we ordered parts in the
first week of our on stations covering
backordered so instead of wasting time
not doing anything this is what we see
depended to stay on a robot so when I
first came in during the forest out of
six weeks and they're ready to go we're
not known as the big dollar district
usually when I take them to competition
they're not looked at as the kids that
are going to be very competitive just
because of the area we come from but
once we're there and competing they see
what they're up again
every year my kids come back from
college to tell me just having access to
this type of equipment put them so far
ahead of the curve one of the disabled
students in our campus who have trouble
simply feeding yourself and lifting up
her arms because of the muscular
dystrophy and she has on the left arm
we've utilized the force of gravity
mimicking the triceps and the bison when
she is an arresting position her arm
weight which is dropped the exoskeleton
and then when she needs to pick up a
fork or spoon to get herself because of
the bands on the flexibility she's able
to feed yourself with what amount of
effort than she used to do without sex
the most important thing that I see is
that tangible object with the kids
yeah they can sketch it on paper they
can draw it on the computer but in the
past ups where it ended now they can
take that thing from paper and get a
physical object and I really think
that's where they could get excited
about it and start thinking in their
head what the future is the people what
they can
