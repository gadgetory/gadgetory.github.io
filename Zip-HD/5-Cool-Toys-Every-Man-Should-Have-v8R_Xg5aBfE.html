microphone person to deliver amazing
after a whole year of the planning and
research with countless trials and
errors we finally finished our prototype
the ganker which is a next-generation
fighting robot with our application you

insensitive sports
you can even customize a robot - weapons
and armours the customizable ganker is a

home at parties with your friends and
even in our robot tournaments around the
world with the ganker he brings you a
brand new entertainment experience
the future is here and with it robots
but building your own robot can be
overwhelming and unintuitive not anymore
these are the guys from zero UI their
dream is to make robotics easy and fun
for everyone
their team created the zero the world's
first hand gesture control robotics kit
for everyone
zero consists of three parts the
motorized modules the smart glove and
the smartphone app zeros modular design
enables freeform robotics construction
enabling you to build virtually anything
modules can be animated in a hinge or
360 degree rotational movement pair your
glove to the modules with a smartphone
app and bring your robot to life
whether you're a robotics enthusiast an
aspiring superhero evil genius and
training or someone looking to expand
their creativity
Xaro is for you zero is for all ages and
all genders there's no limitations you
can design and build it from scratch or
use a premade starter kit design build
rebuild zero can be used over and over
again making new and different robots
each time with the same modules learning
should be fun and engaging unleash your
creativity and be at the forefront of
robotic technology with zero I'm excited
to introduce to you one of the most
innovative products in the world of
watersports in a long time the Bixby jet
the big speech jet is a mini water
propulsion device designed to attach to
virtually anything you want to motorized
in water attach it to your kayak you can
attach it to your stand up paddleboard
and if that wasn't enough we've
developed a submersible battery pack
that you can attach to your big speech
at and at about 5 pounds you now have
the world's first and only portable
diver propulsion vehicle this is going
to change the way we interact with our
water sports
the possibilities are endless
you can motorized virtually anything the
Bixby jet can push a kayak up to about
seven miles an hour you can go a lot
further you can fight for it to fight
win you can explore places that you
weren't able to before
we've built in dozens of features to
make this a truly versatile and modular
product most importantly we wanted to
make sure you can use your existing
watercraft there is no need for you to
purchase a new kayak or new stand-up
paddleboard
we've spent the past 18 months working
on this amazing product we've sourced
all the parts we've tested them in every
body of water you can imagine we've been
to 11 major iterations of the Bixby jet
and at every turn you've improved it
you've made it better we've made it more
efficient and now it's ready for you
with your support we can produce 500
units which is the minimum we need to
make the big squeeze affordable support
our Kickstarter campaign and help us
bring this amazing product to life
thank you and see you on the water
[Laughter]
