of Letterman's heavy duty utility
features with the most necessary file
maintenance tools built with the ar-15
m16 platform in mind the primary
features on the mud make it the perfect
tool for uniformed professionals and
civilian shooters the bolt override tool
on the utility model allows for clearing
a piece of brass or live round jammed
between the chamber charging handle and
the bolt carrier to clear this
malfunction drop the magazine insert
your bolt override tool onto the bolt
carrier and pull back shortly to the
rear this will clear the round and your
gun will once again be operational the
replaceable firearm disassembly punch
makes for easy removal of takedown and
retaining pins the 1/8 inch standard
punch can be used alone or with the
hammer end of the month when more force
is needed the hex Torx screwdriver bit
on the mush is extra long and sized
specifically to fit both old and new
optics rings adjustment to an a2 pistol
grip and most optic adjustments screws
can be made with the extra-long quarter
inch screwdriver and the opposing
Phillips number 2 is sized for heavy
duty utility work
the shorter Phillips number one two and
three sixteenth inch screwdriver bit is
perfect for more general equipment
adjustment and keeps the cutters blocked
when not in use the replaceable carbon
scraper for cleaning performance
degrading carbon buildup is made of
bronze to prevent damage and scarring of
parts the tool is designed to reach all
areas of the bolt carrier group with
plenty of surface area to clean them
quickly
there are both male and female threads
on the mud for attachment and use of
your standard cleaning rods and brushes
both models of the mud come with a 1/2
inch and 3/8 inch wrench with 12-point
heads for optic systems adjustment as
well as a rugged Molly sheath for
transport of the tool wrench and any
extra bits in addition to the firearm
specific tools there are the everyday
carry utility tools synonymous with the
Leatherman name needlenose pliers
regular pliers replaceable regular and
hard wire cutters a saw bit driver and
hammer make the mutt a perfect
all-around field tools it's the mud
designed to Letterman's rigorous
standards for the military law
enforcement and civilian shooters and
tested by operational professionals the
world over
thank you
for more than 30 years the Leatherman
multi-tool has been the go-to solution
for a lot of different problems in so
many different places on the trail
between here and over there in a bass
boat on Lake Minnetonka here in the
kitchen right under there and starting
today that includes some of the places
we haven't been able to go gate 72 row
12 seat Oh introducing tread the first
multi-tool that lets you be the one who
gets it done anywhere tread is 25
hard-working tools you wear on your
wrist
including Phillips and flathead
screwdrivers texts and box wrenches even
a cutting hook and a bottle opener so
regardless of the job the right tool is
always at hand tread features 11
interchangeable links each crafted from
injection molded 17 for stainless steel
there's an optional Swiss made timepiece
water resistant at 200 meters with a
shock resistant sapphire crystal and it
all comes with a choice of two rugged
finishes
tread the go to go anywhere tool from
leather hi i'm mike scully creator of
the lever gear tool card i founded lever
gear to design products that solve real
problems look great and will last
forever we all have little projects that
pop up in life and they don't always
happen when our tools are handy it's
annoying that to spend time chasing down
tools for a job that should take 10
seconds if you're like me it usually
ends up getting added to your to-do list
that's why we created the lever gear
tool card it's a multi-tool the size of
a credit card that has 40 different
tools it's always with you so you can
get things done I like to be prepared to
handle any task but I also hate the idea
of carrying around a lot of extra stuff
a credit card size tool that could
disappear in my wallet seemed like the
perfect solution we developed the tool
card with a simple premise the real
estate in your pocket is precious so you
should own stuff that's actually worth
carrying we began our design process by
brainstorming all the functions we could
pack into a credit card sized multi-tool
we also tested every car that existed on
the market we thought a lot about the
design and layout of the tool card by
nesting the tools we were able to add
tools and reduce weight without
sacrificing strength we kept the edges
smooth so it feels great in your hand
when you're using the tools we chose not
to have an exposed blade so the tool
card is TSA compliant and it won't
damage your wallet instead we added a
blade protected by the can opener you
can cut cord but not your fingers
the tool card weighs only one ounce flip
speedily into your wallet so you won't
notice it until you need it or ditch the
wallet altogether innovative money clip
is designed to snap on with a click and
disassemble with ease no extra tool is
required
no fasteners to lose so you can quickly
switch from wallet card to money clip
tool card is made in America from blade
quality 420 stainless steel which is
then heat treated for excellent strength
and hardness its then bead blasted for a
professional finish and laser etched for
rich permanent graphics the tool card
makes an awesome gift that will last a
lifetime and it's scheduled to ship
before Father's Day and graduation we've
put in a lot of time to make this tool
as good as it can be
please help us by supporting our
campaign and sharing it with your
friends thank you
