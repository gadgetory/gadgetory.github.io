nice tell the world's first dynamic core
trainer empowered by game-playing
technology simply follow the stealth
gaming app and feel all your muscles
working together to build the strongest
view possible it's easy to get started
using stealth simply download the
stealth gaming app on your smartphone
places inside stealth choose your game
get into the plank position and start
gaming your core compete with anyone
anywhere using spells multiplayer
function stealth your way to great
looking abs and a strong healthy back in
under three minutes a day I'm Howie
inventor of stealth a year ago I was at
the gym staring down at my phone doing
the plank exercise and I was so bored
the next day I called my buddy Don Brown
I call him the king of all ABS he
developed the ab roller sold in millions
of homes I've been designing fitness
products for over 30 years when how he
shared his idea for stealth I was all-in
I love the concept of using your core
muscles to play games on your phone now
that's exciting we went through dozens
of designs and testing until we find a
lot of stealth I'm really competitive of
being able to compete against other
people when on it is so fun you
completely forget about the whole
feeling of working out because you're
focusing on the game I think that's the
best part about it is that you get a
great workout you're working a lot of
different muscles but you also have any
fun we are so excited to bring stealth
to life to have everyone experience what
fun poor training is all about
say hello to the a blaster the a blaster
cuts through all the gimmicks and large
machines and allows you to get the most
complete core workout you've ever had
turning everyday set up into an ad
blasting core workout that will
challenge even the most hardcore of
athletes this isn't some fancy new
technology promising you even more than
the last new things the key is how it
enables you to target very specific
parts of your core to angular placement
the a blaster allows you to set and lock
your feet in 15 degree increments to
make sure you actually target every part
of your core most people think of one
score as one big muscle group they think
that doing tons of situps to school for
midsection
during sit-ups is great for your
six-pack muscles which are imperative to
your strength flexibility and balance
but the muscles on the side the internal
and external obliques are targeted in a
different way
due to their twisting motion all of
these muscles work to keep your body
aligned balanced and strong stronger
core means that your body can work
faster and harder whether for work play
or competition it can also be used for
post pregnancy rebound or injury
recovery workouts because you can set
exactly what part of your core to target
you can strengthen the part of your
midsection that needs it and stay away
from parts that don't hi
I'm Dimitri vos my goal wasn't to
reinvent the setup or the crunch but to
create a way for everybody to get a
complete core workout without having to
live at the gym or have big bulky
equipment taking up a lot of space in
their home so I created the a blaster
and I'm now ready to share it with the
rest of the world if you know somebody
who's interested in staying fit and
healthy please send them this video when
you live in the city you work hard and
you play hard too but keeping a healthy
lifestyle can be surprisingly
challenging especially when every inch
of floor space counts luckily we faced
the same problem that's why we created
practice an innovative weight lifting
system designed for the urban lifestyle
practice is the ultimate space paper we
design practice to be amazingly
versatile develop your strength and
muscle power
work on your core muscle
which from dumbbell to kettlebell in
just seconds it's bad easy practice is
the only set you'll ever need for a full
body workout whether you're a beginner
or advanced in the city face isn't the
only thing at a premium your time is -
that's why we've designed practice you
can take it anywhere to achieve your
goals on your own schedule at home or in
the park the choice is yours
this is the grip valve and it's about to
take your workout to the next level and
all in one device so simple yet so
innovative the grip bell will change the
way you approach fitness similar to
freeways the grip valve provides the
unstable force that's key to effective
strength training and like the
kettlebell its center of mass can be
extended beyond the hand facilitating
ballistic movement fostering power but
the grip Bell is so much more the grip
Bell can be easily passed around your
body to work on different muscle groups
in a natural and intuitive way that
promotes proper posture and form why did
I invent the grip Bell well for years I
really struggled with weight just
obesity years and years of struggling
trying to lose weight and I tried
different things
I tried dumbbell I tried kettle bell I
tried barbell none of them seemed to
really meet my needs
it wasn't satisfied so I invented an
entire new system of felt and that's the
advent of the grip Bell the grip Bell
will be available in five different ways
3 pounds 5 8 10 and 12 pounds the grip
sells sleek patented design is key to
its effectiveness precision made equate
is perfectly balanced the grip valve
cord used recycled cast iron co-molded
with a hypoallergenic two-tone
polyurethane providing the perfect
amount of grip with the right amount of
clip for hand-to-hand routines the five
grid point design allows for effortless
work up that can be choreographed from
hundreds of available exercise routines
moving agile ii from one through another
seamlessly and safely the really unique
thing about the grip
is that all the Bell waves are exactly
the same physical size and shape this
means that with grifoll as you change
weights because you're getting stronger
the muscle memory for that exercise is
exactly retained you can immediately
change from feeling like the use of a
kettle bell to a dumbbell to a barbell
and back and forth when the same amount
of time you can just grab a different
handle you can do all kinds of different
exercises anywhere while you're walking
like you're swimming while you're doing
yoga what you're doing damn well you're
doing martial arts you can use it for
physical therapy in the gym
really it's just a limitless variety of
opportunities to use this there are
hundreds of exercises and yet there's
still much safer than a kettlebell the
ergonomics and balance and flow are
consistent across all the weights it
makes grip bell routines effective safe
and easy to learn the grip Bell provides
ballistic fitness by combining the
kettlebells focus on core strength and
the flexibility offered by free weights
once you hold it you'll see there's
nothing like it
the timeline bill yes that is probably
about eight months we need to order
units we need to develop the box design
for shipping we need to develop how to
package the grip bell but not only that
we have a fashion clothing line to
finish we have to hire designers need to
