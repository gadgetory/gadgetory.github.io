Jordan and I wanted to tell you about
human gears new utensil line the go
bites
there's the uno duo and trio we made the
go bites from a proprietary nylon
material that's virtually unbreakable
while other utensils may not hold up
there's a reason we back the go bikes
with a lifetime warranty the Uno's you
shape is ergonomic and we improved the
fork and spoon ends the spoon is deep
enough for soup and designed to scrape
up every last piece of food the fork
times are long enough for pasta and the
tapered splitter times easily cut out
softer foods
the duo has the same optimized fork and
spoon hands and adds some neat tricks of
its own you can use the fork and spoon
separately or connect them together for
a tool that's even longer than most
extra-long utensils so it's no sweat to
reach into deep containers without
getting sauce all over your hands the
trio packs a full sized fork spoon and
knife into an ultra-thin case the tools
feature the same optimized ends and
they're accessible separately just grab
the one you want
the trio's knife is sharp enough to cut
chicken and it even has a bottle oven we
think you'll like the toothpick too so
that's the go bite lineup super-strong
ergonomic smart and backed 100% by our
lifetime warranty the go bites uno duo
and trio the civilized tools for eating
on the go
only from human gear remember the last
time you needed to send a message or
tell someone where you were but for some
reason you couldn't that's because they
were probably too many people around or
you were too far from a tower or maybe
the network was down and you probably
saw this or this or one of these that's
all about to change with go tena go
Tennant pairs wirelessly with your
smartphone making it possible to text
and share your location with anyone else
who also has even when you don't have
service no need for cell towers Wi-Fi or
satellites with lieutenant
better one find friends even when the
rest of the crowd is struggling to get
their message go 10 is great for travel
because it works anywhere in the world
explore and roam for free and if there's
an emergency you can send a message to
all go tennis within range because
here's the thing cell phones are great

service no problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
