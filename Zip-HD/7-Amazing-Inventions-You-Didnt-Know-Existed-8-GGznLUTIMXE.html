nothing we put in a ton of effort and
sweat our emotions rise with each point
and set and somehow this keeps happening
for they love 15 it's 40 love no no it's
4050 how can you say it's 40 50 40 51
the point is and its 2015 I'm sure no hi
everybody I'm in the room a professional
tennis player and the CEO of past play
this scene happens every day on every
court around the world you know why
because amateur players don't have
somebody keeping the score and ran like
I did in short they don't have what the
pros have that's why I came up with pass
play a wearable device sync to an app
then just with a click or ballon keep
the score for you and helps you focus on
your game and go hook them up I'll take
it from here
so what's this professional playing
experience we've created well a
professional playing experience is
having close play keep the score for you
so you don't have to
for Neela is having pulse play announced
the score for you in one of 50 different
voices my favorite Elvis fluoridate love
is having a record of all your match
history so you can view it at all times
and see your improvement a professional
playing experience is having the first
ranking system for amateur players so we
will finally know how good you are
compared to your friends or other
players from your country or even the
world and last but not least most
players the new and easy way to find new
players at your level where ever you
want
pulse play takes care of everything
score keeping announcement opponents
history and ranking so you can stay
focused on the game
in 2007 Steve Jobs said that this was
the best input device that was 2007 this
is 2015 in 2015 we love our touchscreens
we take them everywhere we go and why
wouldn't we they're light they're
powerful and they're gorgeous but
they're not a perfect input device to
fully express ourselves we need better
precision and more space this is free
and it takes you way beyond the screen
with free you can write or draw on
nearly any surface and your words or
pictures will appear on your screen

direct interaction with the world around
us in part by freeing us to use one of
our most personal skills handwriting

engine can trace anyone's handwriting on
nearly any surface to an incredible
level of accuracy there is never been
anything like it
give us a minute Mitch our audience
sensor it was a miniature laser which
has a collimated beam to the surface
reflections from the surface combined
with internal reflections to give us
emotion signals in fact we invented the
world's smallest three-dimensional laser
interferometer that is truly amazing let
me take it from here
free is all about minimizing whatever
stands in the way of your creative
energy it's got a mini touch display for
notifications that you reply instantly
and even doubles as a headset to take
phone calls don't make up write yourself
a note the second you think of it jot

incredibly comfortable and efficient
mobile creative station and best of all

I always wanted to fly with birds when I
was a kid my family fulfilled his dream
my daddy and my granddaddy they created
the first mechanical bird it was not a
plane it was a wing flapping machine
today my dream is to create Bionic bird
for the 21st century it will be
connected it's a flag up there is Bionic
bird this is the prototype the egg is a
portable charger you can charge a bird
in less than 12 minutes Bionic body is
only eight point five grams it has
electric motor of Europe on f1 the
rotation speed of 55 thousand rpm an
aluminum heatsink and a lithium polymer
batteries it also has a great design
inspired by nature plus you can fly as
high as 100 yard
finally I add my friend
everyone around the world loves a cup of
hot tea and so do we
but there is a problem the electric
kettle
everyone always overfill it heating
excess water and wasting energy research
proves that one day of extra energy use
from overfilling electric kettles it's
enough to light all the streetlights in
England for a night with Mito we set out
to solve this problem meter only heats
as much water as you need in the vessel
of your choice simply fill your cup with
water place it onto the induction base
and immerse the rod in the liquid the
base then heats the disc of the rod
which heats the liquid surrounding it
giving you the exact amount of hot water
you wanted we focused on a simple and
elegant design that is intuitive to use
me to adjust to your needs you can heat
milk for a hot chocolate or warm up the
food for your baby are you having guests
over no problem just prepare an entire a
tea kettle for everyone to share
exactly and I want you to be seen
they're the first ones you see in the
morning when you brush your teeth
they're at your feet they just want love
sometimes a tree
they're always there when you need
someone need not feel lonely your pet is
there to care for you
so of course you want to repay the favor
best friends doesn't quite describe the
bond with them it's quite a different
flavor of lovin when you have the part
on your journey every good pet owner
gets a guilty feeling inside when
leaving your best friend all by
themselves
safe is the only thing you want to feel
when venturing out this is makey makey
go
the first invention kit ever that goes
everywhere with you it's unbelievably
easy to use clip plug play the computer
just thinks you are touching the
keyboard or the mouse want more buttons
plug in as many as you want Mickey
Mickey go use it with any software in
the world play youtube videos make phone
calls lightning speed book add things to
your cart or play video games</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
