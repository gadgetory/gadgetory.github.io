battery power drains quickly and
charging has become an unavoidable and
frustrating problem our commitment is to
not only make a better external battery
but to improve the charging experience
itself the results of this commitment is
cabin cabin is designed to be perfectly
combined with the iPhone aluminum
unibody construction enables cabin to be
both thin and light preserving the
iPhone solid build quality without
adding unnecessary bulk with our
specially designed micro adapter cabin
can be easily connected and fixed to the
iPhone the magnetic connection is fast
precise and flexible
inside cabin is a 2,200 milliamp per
hour lithium battery helping to extend
iPhones life almost one-and-a-half times
thanks to the non wrapped design and use
of aluminum kevin retains the great in
hand feel of the iphone in order to make
charging even more convenient we have
designed a special duck and lightning
adapter to work with kevin allowing you
to easily charge your iphone and cabin
both at home and on the road
initially we considered wireless
electromagnetic charging but this would
have required a very large external case
to house the induction coils we then
discovered the most convenient way to
charge iphone is with the magnetic
connection similar to the MagSafe power
cord on macbook this is much more
effective than other charging designs
and is simply a joy to use when in need
of a charge cabin is extremely easy to
snap onto your iphone allowing you
unimpeded and continued use cabin is the
modern battery for iphone with a human
eyes design and we believe it represents
the most perfect charging experience yet
introducing the eye pin the eye pin fits
neatly into the headphone jack of any
iPhone now you have a professional laser
pointer that uses about as much power as
it takes to play a song download the eye
pin app to operate your laser pointer
with simple thumb movements connect it
to your computer and your iPhone can now
intuitively flip the pages of your
presentation with a simple swipe up of
your thumb a cursor appears and you can
interact with your presentation

the app even has a countdown alarm to
keep your presentation running on time
the eye pin is so small you can leave it
in your phone without affecting its
functions your phone still remains a
phone just turn the eye pin 90 degrees
to take a call or it conveniently clips
on your headphones for storing it also
comes in several different colors with
stylish caps to suit your style easy to
install and even easier to use take your
eye pin anywhere to take any
presentation to the next level
we have seen advancements in mobile
phone technology that have surpassed our
wildest imagination
but the biggest problem with these
devices is that they rely on batteries
and more often than not these batteries
are unable to hold a charge the devices
have evolved but the charging technology
has not until now introducing sonic
cable from blue tech industries with

the Sun sometimes when you want to take
a photo of yourself or group of people
there's never anyone around to take the
photo for you so the photographer always
ends up getting left after photo
J scam is the world's most compact iPod
tripod it uses a flip-out kickstand and
a mirror bedded in the cake scene in
order to reflect the image in your
iPhone's camera enabling you to take
pictures or video without having to hold
up your phone the case cam app is a
delayed shot feature which allows you to
think group photos without leaving the
photographer comes the shot now here is
the really cool part using another
mobile device in a Wi-Fi connection the

time after time picked our DSLR your
iPhone
let's get straight to the point we
invented this to turn this into a
dual-sim capable phone so if you have
two SIM cards one for personal use one
for business one for data and one for
calls one for what you travel and one
for when you're home
one for Bruce and one for Batman you can
finally use one single iPhone 6 no more
need to carry a second phone to
accommodate your second line renamed it
to a simple phone sleep that you just
snap on however its functionality goes
way beyond dual SIM you can message and
you can call of course and you can
access all your contacts from your
primary line to your secondary line

these pretty lights it's easy to know
what's going on speaking of pretty women

electricity socket quick beauty brains

delivered in this type of language our
goal was to deliver a virtual reality
headset to the masses for under $100
inch is a patent pending case for your

objects used in virtual reality headsets

natural four factor resume requests the
