for there has never been a better time
than now to feel more energized more
mentally alert to improve your
productivity and create the healthier
you
we all have something in our life that
we want to improve for me last year it
was living healthier so I began
exercising and eating better but for a
long time as so felt sluggish and tired
it's like where did all my energy go and
then I realized that I forgot the most
important part drinking water we are
tracking everything about our body right
now our exercise or sleep our diet but
there's no easy way for us to track the
most essential thing to a body water
it's the next piece of the puzzle I
thought there must be a solution here so
I got my friends together and in 54
hours we built a first makeshift
prototype of a smart water bottle it
tracks how much water you drink and
think that over to your phone it was
really rough but it worked and a big
question was could we make this real so
we quit our jobs packed our bags and
left everything familiar behind to work
on a product that we believed in
hydrate neat is a smart water bottle
that tracks your daily water consumption
and sinks to an app on your phone so you
can stay hydrated all day long it's
simple
so you enter a few things about yourself
and the app will calculate your daily
water goal the bottle connects to your
phone via bluetooth and there's a sensor
that tracks how much water you drink so
you don't have to think about it so if
you've forgotten to drink water the
bottle will glow to remind you and the
battery lasts for over a year so you'll
never have to charge it it syncs with
your favorite wearables and fitness apps
and so if you go on a long run or
workout it'll increase your daily water
goal to make sure you stay hydrated the
app can use your location to account for
the temperature humidity and elevation
of your surroundings so if you're in
Colorado and the mountains the app will
remind you to drink more we carry our
water bottles with us everywhere so we
wanted to make something that was sleek
elegant and smart and could transition
from the gym the office so something
that is technically advanced but doesn't
look like a tech product because we want
to be natural almost like a natural
extension of yourself
while working or at school I found
myself sitting at my computer
eight hours more a day I'd get terrible
headaches and I felt fatigued I wanted
to research what was happening and I
finally narrowed it down I was just

complicated your hydration shouldn't

problem led us to a more important
question how much water should we be
drinking drinking too much or too little
can be dangerous and the reality is that
everyone's optimal level of hydration
depends on a bunch of different factors
that are unique to you your workout
schedule age gender location your sweat
rate and even the weather are all key to
the equation in the past only elite
athletes had access to the tools needed
to dial in optimal hydration that is
