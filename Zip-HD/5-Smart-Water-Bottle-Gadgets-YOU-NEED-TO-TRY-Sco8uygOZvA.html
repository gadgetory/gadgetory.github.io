I'm going to drink watts of water today
but at the end of the day you're
exhausted tired and dehydrated because
you forgot again in the office at home
or on-the-go it can be really hard to
remember to drink enough water living a
busy life and you're not alone
over 75% of Americans are chronically
dehydrated all the time what's worse
though is that not drinking enough water
is really bad for your health it saps
your energy it gives you headaches it

the dishwasher so what are you waiting
for there has never been a better time
than now to feel more energized more
mentally alert to improve your
productivity and create the healthier
you
we all have something in our life that
we want to improve for me last year it
was living healthier so I began
exercising and eating better but for a
long time as so felt sluggish and tired
it's like where did all my energy go and
then I realized that I forgot the most
important part drinking water we are
tracking everything about our body right
now our exercise or sleep our diet but
there's no easy way for us to track the
most essential thing to a body water
it's the next piece of the puzzle I
thought there must be a solution here so
I got my friends together and in 54
hours we built a first makeshift
prototype of a smart water bottle it
tracks how much water you drink and
think that over to your phone it was
really rough but it worked and a big
question was could we make this real so
we quit our jobs packed our bags and
left everything familiar behind to work
on a product that we believed in
hydrate neat is a smart water bottle
that tracks your daily water consumption
and sinks to an app on your phone so you
can stay hydrated all day long it's
simple
so you enter a few things about yourself
and the app will calculate your daily
water goal the bottle connects to your
phone via bluetooth and there's a sensor
that tracks how much water you drink so
you don't have to think about it so if
you've forgotten to drink water the
bottle will glow to remind you and the
battery lasts for over a year so you'll
never have to charge it it syncs with
your favorite wearables and fitness apps
and so if you go on a long run or
workout it'll increase your daily water
goal to make sure you stay hydrated the
app can use your location to account for
the temperature humidity and elevation
of your surroundings so if you're in
Colorado and the mountains the app will
remind you to drink more we carry our
water bottles with us everywhere so we
wanted to make something that was sleek
elegant and smart and could transition
from the gym the office so something
that is technically advanced but doesn't
look like a tech product because we want
to be natural almost like a natural
extension of yourself
while working or at school I found
myself sitting at my computer
eight hours more a day I'd get terrible
headaches and I felt fatigued I wanted
to research what was happening and I
finally narrowed it down I was just
thirsty life takes practice it can be
complicated your hydration shouldn't
York a smart bottle is your key to
staying hydrated so you can perform at
your peak by tracking your fluid intake

as athletes we've often needed to track
our water consumption but solving that
problem led us to a more important
question how much water should we be
drinking drinking too much or too little
can be dangerous and the reality is that
everyone's optimal level of hydration
depends on a bunch of different factors
that are unique to you your workout
schedule age gender location your sweat
rate and even the weather are all key to
the equation in the past only elite
athletes had access to the tools needed
to dial in optimal hydration that is
until now introducing Trago the world's
first connected smart water bottle
you
the Trago cap fits on any standard
widemouth water bottle and connects to
an app on your smartphone using
Bluetooth Low Energy

battery because the last thing you need
is another device to charge it uses
patent-pending
ultrasonic technology to measure how
much you drink with the toggle cap you
know exactly how much you should be
drinking each day more than that the app
automatically builds and adjusts your
profile by seamlessly connecting to
other wearable devices so there's no
extra work for you imagine recording a
long workout on another app or device
and then immediately understanding how
to hydrate for proper recovery or using
the app to know just how much water to
drink leading up to a marathon or
football game the Tri go cap also allows
you to monitor teams groups and multiple
bottles coaches and trainers can keep an
eye on all their players because proper
hydration happens long before the game
starts
