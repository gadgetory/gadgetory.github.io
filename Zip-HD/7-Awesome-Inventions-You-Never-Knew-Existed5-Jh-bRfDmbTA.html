pen and paper notebook while saving
everything in the cloud perfectly
organized the way you want and what if
after you saved your notes in the cloud
and filled your paper notebook you could
just erase it with the push of a button
and enjoy a fresh new notebook that's
not magic that's rocket book with the
rocket book notebook and the rocket book
app you blast your notes into the cloud
as fast as you can flip through them in
a fraction of a second rocket book scans
and processes each page even two at a
time rocket book sees where each set of
notes starts and ends and sends
everything to the cloud services you use
in the places they belong each rocket
book page has seven symbols set up the
rocket book app to assign each symbol to
a location within Dropbox Google Docs or
Evernote or simply to your email inbox
let's see how jake has his set up he
marks the airplane symbol and rocket
book sends the notes to his client
meetings notes in Evernote when he's
brainstorming he marks the crown symbol
which he decided are for the notes that
belong in his ideas folder now that your
notes are in the cloud and your notebook
is filled up there's no need to go buy
another book or let use notebooks
clutter your life rocket book has you
covered here's how you can use the same
rocket book over and over by erasing it
after each use with the mere push of a
button take your notes using friction
pilot pens available in many office
supply stores and amazon.com friction
pilot and turns clear under heat and the
rocket book is specially designed
a microwave-safe that means you can
reset rocket book in your microwave
faster than it takes to warm up a cup of
coffee and who doesn't like to start the
day with a fresh new notebook you've
ever hosted a barbecue you have this
fear running out of propane nothing
kills a party quicker than uncooked food
you can lift or tap the tank but that is
not an accurate way to measure just how
much propane is left introducing the
smart gasps watch which uses the
Bluetooth in your phone to connect to
the gas watch mobile app so you never
run out of propane at a crucial time
ever again the smart gas watch lets you
see how much propane is left in the tank
and shows you exactly how much grilling
time you have left before empty the low
level alarm will sound when you're
getting close to empty the smart gas
watch is incredibly easy to set up and
easy to use no tools are required at all
simply place your tank on the scale
download the app and launch when you're
ready it's that easy you'd never go on a
road trip without knowing how much gas
you have left in the fuel tank so why
would you have a barbecue without
knowing how much propane is left
remo is a wristband used to interact
with your environment using natural
gestures as as simple as pointing and
waving at the device you want to control
because we value the input of our users
we brought in a full-time beta tester we
then realize the product could be used
for so much more bob was our first beta
tester hi Bob Bob started by using remo
to control the lights in his house he
then started to discover other devices
that remo could control he even did
things with remo we didn't expect
setting up Remo was easy place the
wireless receiver anywhere plug the
device you want to control into the
receiver smart plug point to control
your device Remo is designed to be
compatible with leaving smart home
systems we're proud to be working with
open home labs to make Remo and open
home certified device this means Remo
will also work seamlessly with over 22
million devices already in US homes
making it even easier for remote to
control the lights the locks and even
thermostats so that you can focus more
on the things that matter
ever wanted to lower your electric bill
know how much actual money and appliance
is costing you find out which of your
appliances consumes power while on
standby hi I'm Jimmy Burke I'm inventor
of the meter plug the meter plug is a
simple device that plugs in between any
appliance and the AC outlet it measures
your consumption and sends that
information over bluetooth to your
smartphone the app will display in
dollars or in your local currency how
much money that appliance is costing you
per hour per day per week month etc the
app displays your real electricity costs
depending on your residence state and
country it can even calculate the cost
if your local state or country has
different costs for electricity at
different times of the day meter bug can
turn on or off any appliance connected
to it you can program it to turn off the
power when it detects an appliance it's
on standby consuming vampire power you
can also program it to turn off an
appliance when you walk away and turn it
back on when you walk near it again
imagine you could leave your office and
your printer and monitor what I'll turn
off as you leave saving you a lot of
money then when you come home your air
conditioner or heater would turn on as
soon as you walk in the door you can
even connect lights to the meter plug as
soon as you're in the area they'll turn
on at certain times your TV you waste
money on standby make a turn off when
you're not at home of course you can
manually turn on or off any appliance
connected to the meter plug within a 100
foot range
