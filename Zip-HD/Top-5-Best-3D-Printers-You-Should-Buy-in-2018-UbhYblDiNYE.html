stereo lithography printer that offers a
combination of innovation quality and
reliability you may have never dreamed
possible at this price
unlike most 3d printers soleus uses a
resin that is cured by a DLP projector
the light from the projector hardens the
resin one layer at a time allowing for
XY resolutions as small as 25 microns
and a Z resolution of just one micron
and still with build times that are up
to 5 times faster than FDM or 3d laser
printers imagine buying a car where you
never have to change the oil our major
breakthrough that sets us apart is our
patent pending peeling technology which
has eliminated the need for recoding or
replacing the resin tanks saving both
time and money build from high-quality
stainless steel components and thick
laser-cut anodized aluminum soleus is
built to last
designed with user-friendly and
non-restrictive software solace gives
you the freedom to use almost any photo
resin with its high resolution smooth
surface finish and fast build speeds
solace is perfect for jewelry design
engineering research and medical
applications
stop interrupting compact good-looking
super easy to use and most importantly
reliable right out of the box and this
is why Mia was created Nia is round sexy
and minimalistic but not without cause
Nia's cylindrical shape adds to the
overall strength and stability compared
to conventional blocks Jake - we know
that desktop real estate is crucial
that's why this footprint the build line
is unmatched we like to say you got room
for a lamp you got room for idea out of
the box Nia is ready to print with
easy-to-use feature-rich software and
our very own cool school fill in the
cartridge however feel free to use any
open source software and third-party
filament that is compatible Nia will
give you the print quality and speed of
an expensive machine but at a much more
affordable price but don't let the
prices fool you Nia is made smart not
cheap our printers are designed
manufactured and assembled right here in
North America using only high-end
electronic components and hardware and
in order to be future ready Nia is
modular once upgrades are available
easily swap out the standard components
for future innovations that are already
in the works
don't be left behind with an obsolete
unit
it's the best of both worlds beautiful
like a Mac Oh put upgradable like a PC
moving on
thirty printing technology pretty cool
stuff let's face it if you look at 3d
printers on the market today you'll find
many problems now it was not our
intention to just make another printer
but rather to take all of the most
desirable features found in the best
current models and to combine them into
one quality product introducing craft
bots the all-new 3d printer that
combines quality and affordability one
problem with many other 3d printers is
they simply cannot make larger often
more practical objects our solution we
designed a printer with the largest
possible build volume and a compact
desktop
another common problem with other
printers is that the finished prints
tend to bend from the plate making them
unusable
the simple solution a heated build
platform that is also easily removed
the best thing about craft bought is
that anybody can use it
and it works right out of the box
craft ball was created by experienced
hardware and software developers working
in the industry for over a decade our
printers are made from high-quality
laser-cut metals and CNC milled
components they incorporate an extremely
detailed 100 micron per layer resolution
with craft fly you can also use any 1.75
millimetre filament allowing you to
choose the one that best fits your
budget our printing material is
environmentally friendly and presents no
hazard to your personal health the
printer can be controlled with craft
wear our own 3d printer software we've
developed a slicer which is also the
fastest and most efficient in its class
the software is also available for
Windows and can be downloaded at any
time and of course other operating
systems will be supported
by combining all these great features
Kraft bought 3d printers have the
potential to change the way people do 3d
introducing stacker a new kind of 3d
printer stacker can print multiple
copies of an object at the same time in
different colors with different kinds of
filament this means stackers at least
four times faster than most other 3d
printers who said 3d printing had to be
slow stacker is the first truly
commercial-grade 3d printer that's
actually affordable stacker is durable
enough for all-day work on your factory
floor and safe enough for busy offices
in schools stacker z-axis can expand to
print 24 inch tall objects or just over
600 millimeters stacker is available in
both desktop and mobile configurations
stacker is designed to print with many
filaments including high-tech alloys
which contain carbon fiber Kevlar PTFE
wood bronze copper brass and bamboo
stacker is definitely a new kind of 3d
printer
