limited number of all blue lens au
housings just for this Kickstarter
campaign look we love our phones and we
use them all the time but about a year
ago we started seeing lots of disgusting
news reports about studies showing how
filthy our phones are this shocked us
but it made total sense we mostly get
sick from our hands and our hands are
always touching the phone which can
constantly breed bacteria because of its
warmth let me put this into perspective
you're out to eat at a restaurant and
you're using a public toilet you're
gonna do everything you can to avoid all
surfaces on that toilet and if you're
like most people you're gonna thoroughly
wash your hands and you might even use a
paper towel to leave the bathroom but
most of us don't even think twice before
replying to a text message or sending
out an email before ordering eaning
remember your cell phone has 18 times
more bacteria than any surface in the
bathroom including the handle on that
public toilet so by using your phone
you've undone that entire cleaning
process we always wash our hands but we
never seem to clean our phones so we set
out on a mission to find the best way to
clean our phones after considering many
methods we found the perfect technology
that's UV light UV light is used in
hospitals and clean rooms throughout the
world and is proven to effectively kill
bacteria and viruses look here lights
perfect for your phone one and uses no
liquids or chemicals and two it uses no
heat
we found the perfect technology for
cleaning our phones but we wanted to
design the perfect product and we did so
with one question money how can we clean
our phones without having any steps to
our daily routine we didn't want to add
our phone to our ever-growing list of
things to clean we wanted the peace of
mind knowing that our phones were clean
without having to remember to clean them
and the solution we came up with is
perfect and we call it phone soap
phone soap is a universal cell phone
charger that simultaneously sanitizes
your phone every night you plug your
phone into charge you might even set an
alarm with phone so you do the exact
same thing you've always done only now
when your alarm goes off
your phone won't just be charged it will
be clean giving you that priceless peace
of mind that you won't be getting sick
from your phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
