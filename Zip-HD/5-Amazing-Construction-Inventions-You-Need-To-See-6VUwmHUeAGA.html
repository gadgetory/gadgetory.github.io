can take two workers over 80 hours to
complete that's two weeks of work two
weeks where you could be doing other
jobs well what if you could turn those
80 hours into just eight
you could build 10 fireplaces on 10
different jobs in the time it used to
take you to build just one introducing
bellegarde elements bellegarde elements
comes pre built and palletized and bail
guards patented forklift design makes
transportation and installation a breeze
with multiple styles and options to
choose from up selling your client on a
beautiful outdoor fireplace or kitchen
or oven has never been easier Belgard
elements is the durable beautiful
money-making product that you've always
wanted protecting structures from water
intrusion has long been a mission of the
design community for masonry wall
systems it is critical that both the
mortar and concrete masonry units known
as CMU contain water repellent
protection to guard against moisture and
wind driven rain when used together
Ameri mix mortar with rain block GT and
CMU containing rain block admixture
create the rain block system for water
protection this wall demonstrates how
the products work together as a system
the left side of the wall is constructed
with CMU and mortar containing no water
repellents on the right side Emira mix
water repellent mortar with rain block
GP and CMU containing rain block were
used as you can see the addition of rain
block water repellent technology has no
impact on the construction or appearance
of the wall a spray bar applies equal
amounts of water to both sides of the
wall in less than five minutes of
application water is beginning to
penetrate the wall section without the
rain block system after 10 minutes water
begins leaking into the wall cavity
while the section using the rain block
system remains dry and repels water
we also attached a GoPro camera to view
the inside of the cavity after 15
minutes water fully penetrates the
section without the rain block system
the front face cavity and back face are
wet
while the rain block system continues to
repel water the spray bar ran for over
five hours and the section using the
rain block system remained completely
dry concrete like all building materials
it deteriorates over time sometimes by
acid rain other times by wear and tear
there are several ways to deal with a
damaged concrete structure do nothing
try a quick fix tear it down or try
hydro demolition it's amazing
behold the Aqua cutter the most
versatile and advanced hydro demolition
robot in the world the Aqua cutter is
connected to a high pressure unit a
power pack together they're like a
sports car and a racing garage basically
everything you'll ever need for your
contracts in one place water the most
natural thing there is essential for
most things in life and hydro demolition
just pump fresh water from an
appropriate water source and you're good
to go
inside the powerpack the water passes
through filters a stabilizer tank a
booster pump and a high-pressure pump
with the help from a powerful diesel
engine and state-of-the-art engineering
you'll achieve the desired pressure and
flow the water leaves the power pack and
travels through the high-pressure hose
to the Aqua cutter thereafter the water
hits the concrete at supersonic speed
and this is where the action begins the
key element of hydro demolition is to
pressurize and Waggin pores and micro
cracks using high-pressure water
penetration a ceramic nozzle creates a
highly concentrated jet of water the
combination of pressure and flow the
precise movements of the aqua color and
the incredible force through the ceramic
jet nozzle creates amazing results
the Aqua cutter is powered by a diesel
engine or an electric motor the
operation is fully automated and easy to
configure on the operators panel
everything's monitored by an operator
with a remote control at a safe distance
you can use our technology for all kinds
of operations and applications from
tight spaces indoors to bridges roads
runways tunnels power plants and walls
the sky's the limit the equal distance
system eds is one of a Quinet grade and
patented innovations with EDS you'll
keep a preset distance from the nozzle
to the concrete surface regardless of
the attacking this means more water jet
power and higher production rates
another great thing is the ability to
cut geometrical shapes like circles
triangles and squares just program your
shape on the display or draw on the
surface easy to use time-saving and
extremely efficient hydro demolition is
ideal for removing selected parts
without damaging the rebar basically you
leave the good concrete and
reinforcements undamaged superior as
technique as durable as a new structure
it's the sustainable way to protect and
preserve concrete constructions
no cracks no jackhammers no problems
just hydro demolition by Aquajet systems
Yuna lift is a paver laying assist
machine that enables one person to lay
pavers at up to 10 square feet per
minute it works on the principle of air
pressure combined with vacuum to make
heavy pavers feel practically waitlist
once the vacuum based lifter is attached
to the surface of the paver the operator
can move the paver into position with
little effort the control lever on the
handle allows for upward and downward
movement and makes it easy to put the
paver into place once the pavers in
place pressing the control lever a
little further down reduces the suction
and releases the paver it's that easy
anyone can learn to use uni left
this is Robin she's from our marketing
department at you dock and she's agreed
to come and try the Uni lift Oh
Robin have you ever been on a hard scape
crew before nope never
so using the you know lift was super
easy way easier than I thought it was
going to be it was effortless it was
weightless I was nervous at first
because I know that pavers are heavy but
lifting three at a time or four at a
time was way easier than I thought it
was going to be to demonstrate the time
that can be saved with unis left we've
set up a couple of different comparison
tests on one side we have a crew
installing pavers by hand on the other
side we'll be installing pavers using
unis left the hand placing team has to
carry the stones over to the laying edge
the main crew member who's laying the
stones is either on his knees or
frequently bending over to lay the
pavers in contrast the Installer using
yoona lifts is lifting and placing the
pavers from a more comfortable standing
position accurate placement is easy with
yoona lifts if a small adjustments to
the level of a particular stone is
needed
simply remove the paver make adjustments
to the betting course and then replace
the paver after only a couple hundred
square feet laid our hand install team
is starting to show signs of fatigue but
yoona lift is still going strong using a
larger scale paver like yuna locks on
brianna or series 3000 is a great option
for driveways and is both easy to
install and fast thanks to you and a
lift one person operating the unit can
place these 130 pounds series three
thousand pavers two at a time with very
little effort
the finished driveway will have fewer
joints which makes for easier joints and
installation and long-term maintenance
after an hour it's clear to see that the
unil IFFT is outpacing the hand install
crew and the you know lift operator
isn't even tired combining the power and
speed of yuna lifts with the efficiency
of installing large format pavers takes
yuna lifts to a whole new level these
large format pavers would be impossible
to lay by hand but with yuna lifts its
vast ease
and accurate to demonstrate the combined
power of larger format pavers and yoonah
lifts we speed tests that are large
ambriano units using yuna lifts against
a typical hand install of brussels block
after one hour one man with the unit
left had laid three times the amount
compared to the hand install crew as you
can see there are huge labor saving
advantages by using in lift you know
lift is a versatile machine with a lift
capacity of over 300 pounds custom
suction heads can be designed to
accommodate a variety of products sizes
and textures notice how there is no loss
of suction even on the flagstone surface
texture of rich clift excel pavers the
positive grip of yuna lift allows you to
work more quickly accurately and safely
a machine that lays down paving bricks
which is fed with loose bricks and lays
them out onto the road as it slowly
moves along it is electrically powered
and available in 13 16 and 20 foot
widths the machine consists of few
moving parts so noise and maintenance
are kept to a minimum
