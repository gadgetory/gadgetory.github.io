the next generation work boot for guys
who never punch out built around our EPX
anti fatigue technology in the
lightweight comfort of our carbon mac
safety toe this boot fuses the most
advanced components to keep you going
strong inside we engineered EPX into a
more compact multi-layer design it
brings comfort even closer to the foot
and returns pure energy to fight fatigue
all day long on top of that we added our
carbon max safety tone this
revolutionary toe cap uses
nanotechnology for added strength better
fit and a lightweight profile you'll

fish tape provides a faster easier way
to push and pull fish tapes to EMT and
PVC conduit the low friction spiral
extruded polymer allows the tape to
easily glide through conduit without
binding it turns joints or couplings the
simple face tapes are kink and break
resistant combining the strength of a
steel face tape with greater flexibility
than fiberglass fish tapes the non
conductive material is also rust
resistant and will not deform when bent
like other fish tape materials these
fish tapes are lightweight and greatly
reduce user fatigue and downtime on the
job due to fish tape breakage the simple
fish tape features two different leaders
on various models the flexible metal
leaders with a swiveling tip allows the
fish tape to roll off turns and continue
moving without binding in tight radius
turns the fish tapes also feature a non
conductive glow-in-the-dark leader
making the fish tape non conductive from
end to end allowing for easy
installation over existing wires simple
fish tapes are a must-have for any
professional electrical contractor

wernher the world leader in ladders
introduces a new style of ladder the
lean safe step ladder a ladder designed
to be used as a standard stepladder and
a leaning ladder built with all the
features of the 6200 series 300 pound
duty rated step ladders plus the ability
to safely lean when in the closed

wall surfaces wall corners poles and
wall studs all lean safe ladders have a
lower rear rail to front rail connection
point allowing the user to get closer to
the work when in step ladder mode
leaning a standard stepladder is not an
option on a jobsite so we designed the
lean safe ladders with a two color
design and highly visible leaned safe
logos to make this ladder easily
distinguishable from a standard
stepladder leaning a ladder safely
requires that the rear rail is latched
to the front rail
Werner's patent-pending single latch
design stays engaged when needed and is
centrally located to easily open and
close anchoring the ladder is the edge
