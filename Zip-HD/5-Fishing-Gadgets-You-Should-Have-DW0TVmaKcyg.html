all-seeing sonar the smart rod has a

sensitivity setting the HML display will

what setting you're in as well as
letting you know the rod is on and
scanning for fish activity we use the
high output piezo to be sure of a low
quality alarm the multiple visual alerts
are high output LEDs we design these
high-tech rods to be easy to use with
only one button once you turn it on it
does all the thinking for you so you can
concentrate on catching fish our
patented technology is unlike any
fishing product ever made as an example
in high sensitivity setting you can
actually walk around while holding your
rod and it will not go off but even with
the slightest fish nibble it will alarm
every time the rod is so smart it will
automatically shut itself down when you
are reeling in your fish so its not to
interfere with your fishing experience
and reset itself after recasting if
you're fishing in wind rain or trolling
just set it to medium or low there's
also a light only alert setting so as
not to disturb other fishing you just
hold the button until it goes silent
then release the button now you can
choose your sensitivity setting
how can it do this I'm glad you asked

hi my name is Chris Derek product
manager for Hodgman and I'm in Alberta
Canada and I've been phill'd testing the
Nueces shell jacket from Hodgman with
Steve from Al fly-fishing Outfitters so
this is our new waiting style jacket
it's a little bit longer than
traditional waiting jackets to give you
a little bit more versatility the
material in the asus jacket is our VTech
hydrophilic laminate and what that does
is it pulls moisture away from your body
so if you work up a sweat the water
vapor is actually going to pull away
from your body adds a little bit more
comfort on the chest are two large
capacity storage pockets that hold a
standard size fly box or three
low-profile boxes as well on the chest
also are two vertical zip storage
pockets the recessed so if you fill them
up they're not going to stick very far
out away from your chest and get in your
way when you're fishing the lower hand
pockets are designed a special way so if
you're using a drift boat they're not
going to catch on your oars and rip out
blow out of your jacket or if you're
waiting deep they do have a mesh
drainage panel so you're not going to
carry around a whole lot of excess water
weight this jackets also designed with
free range of motion so if you're
casting or you're using a drifts out and
rowing it's not going to bind up on you
and it gives you a lot of freedom to
move around on the chest you'll see a
removable magnetic fly patch you can
pull that off and move it to the
standard packing
that do have a hook and loop attachment
the cuffs on this jacket or a storm
style cuff so you can cinch them tight
and they have an elastic band so it does
it feel very constrictive around your
hand so if you're releasing a fish water
isn't going to flow up inside of your
jacket and you're not going to be
walking around with a wet sleeve all day
long
on the back of these jackets is also a
d-ring for accessory attachment so you
can pull off a net and use that there as
well or any other accessories that you
prefer to put on the d-ring the hood on
this jacket is designed with a wire brim
hood to keep rain out of your face
and also has a three-way adjustment so
you can cinch it up around the back to
maintain your peripheral vision or you
can scale it around the side to keep
rain from going in your eyes the next
time you're at your local outfitter

Hodgman
