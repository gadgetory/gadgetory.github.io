Americans will experience a power outage
in their home in a two-year span more
than 70 million experienced an outage
that lasted more than 24 hours storms
come and storms go but what happens when
the power goes according to the latest
national averages a power outage can
view more than leave you and your family
in the dark it can drain your pocketbook
think of what you have to lose without
the backup protection of a Briggs &amp;amp;
Stratton home standby generator 150
bucks a night in a hotel plus a good
night's sleep in your own bed over 200
dollars in lost spoiled food no not the
waffles pizza and ice cream oh you don't
even want to know what a flooded
basement will run you nineteen hundred
dollars for cleaning and thousands to
put in new flooring about three thousand
dollars to redo the wall a few hundred
to repair the furnace and AC oh then
there's the mold removal figure another
three thousand dollars for that or you
can make one small investment in a home
standby generator from Briggs &amp;amp; Stratton
and not think twice about it what you
stand to gain outweighs what you have to
lose night lights are important keeping
them healthy and well fed matters alert
and refreshed ready for the day and
that's the end of the day you can look
back knowing you've done your part to
maintain your household without letting
something as unavoidable as a power
outage stand in the way of your family's
comfort and well-being so what do you
have to lose home standby generators

portable generators on the other hand

which in the middle of bad weather may
not be the most convenient thing to do
automatic standby generators are
hardwired into the home to provide power
to the essential circuits that you've
already selected automatically it's also
going to run continuously on natural gas
or LP so you don't have to worry about
sloppy refills of gasoline or shutting
it down for a while before it keeps
going just a safer better alternative
hello everyone my name is Jake Thomas
and I am Jenna axe product manager for
our air cooled standby generator line
I'm pleased to introduce to you today
the very first 22 kW air-cooled backup
generator now not only is Generac the
leader in the back-up generator
categories for the US but we also
realized that there was a value barrier
for people that needed more than 20 kW
so we decided to embark on the path of
creating the very first 22 kW backup
air-cooled generator previously if
somebody wanted to get this much power
they would have to use a liquid cooled
system which is easily double the cost
so this is the best value in terms of
backup power it also comes with all the
great features that people have come to
expect from The Guardian product lines
it features our Generac OHV i engine
built right here in whitewater Wisconsin
our innovative evolution control it also
comes in an all-weather aluminum
enclosure to protect it from the
elements which can be installed as close
as 18 inches away from a building not
only does this generator also provide
the largest amount of power available in
an air-cooled backup generator system it
also uses our to power technology which
provides less than 5% THD or total
harmonic distortion for more information

generator log on to Generac com
oh stop the other detail
I appear the procedure whatever that is
