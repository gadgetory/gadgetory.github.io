Bob because I'm well smart I find all
these cool gadgets that plug into the
internet of things and have people
saying hey why didn't I think to use
that duh is because smart Bob thought of
it first here's my latest discovery no
it's not a shower
it's called even drop the first March
tile that helps you save water did you
know the average shower uses 17 gallons
of water of course you didn't even drop
you can cut that in half here let me
show you how it works
usually we turn on the shower you like
to apply yourself with other more
inventive ways to pass the time waiting
for that perfect temperature that is
until you realize you've been running
the water the entire time how much water
do I waste I wasn't even in the shower
yet but now with a drop I can program
the temperature I like and its internal
heat sensor detects when it hits my
desired temperature and cuts the flow of
water no more waste of water while you
away from the shower now when I welcome
to chapter on the water it's hot right
away no waiting
that's not all even I can do even more
it uses this proximity sensor system to
automatically adjust the flow of water
depending on where I am in the shower
and what I'm doing if I'm right under
the showerhead rinsing shampoo from my
hair I get 100% flow right and I need it
but my step back just so bub the water
flow reduces simply water while still
keeping me comfortable and warm if I go
even further away to get soap or even
shave my legs they reduce the flow of
water even more it's simple and
automatic smooth even Josh universal
design fits any shower any size and it's
easily installed between the resisting
showerhead and the wall but what's
really cool is the even drop app all of
this can be controlled and tracked
through the app so I can set goals those
preferences switch between large and
small shower settings even see how much
more I'm saving each day so take it from
smart Bob get Eve a drop it's a smart
away shower a nerve react is the world's
first intelligent stove safety device
that attaches directly to your existing
knobs and recognizes potential threats
turn your stove off before it's too late
how many of you have ever left
food cooking on the stove for too long
and ended up with smoke everywhere or
even a fire or left your house then just
wondered whether you left the stove on
if you've never left your stove on
before you may wonder whether this is
even a problem that needs a solution the
kitchen is the center of our homes
it's where so much of life happens
spending time with loved ones preparing
food and sharing meals with so much
happening it's easy to forget something
as simple as turning off your stove if
we're not careful something terrible can
happen I know because it happened to me
in the United States alone there are
over 350 7,000 house fires each year
that's one house fire every 85 seconds
these house fires caused almost 13,000
injuries per year and seven deaths every
day and cooking equipment is the most
common cause how many of these can be
prevented with a nerve react a nerve
react uses a combination of sensors and
electronics within these units to turn
your stove off when a hazardous
situation is detected over for one even
arises attach your existing knobs to the
device or use them as your new nose and
place a sensory net on the ceiling above
this unit is the brains of the device
and houses a gas sensor and smoke
detector which when activated signaled
the lab unit to turn off the burner this
unit also contains a motion sensor
that's linked to a timer and the knob
unit you select the time interval you
want using the touch sensor or you can
use a default setting if no motion is
detected in the vicinity of your stove
during that time interval the novel
activate and turn your stove off a nerve
reacts novel design allows it to work on
any gas or electric stove and attach two
knobs of all shapes and sizes and if
you're away from home the smartphone app
allows you to check whether your stove
is on and turn it off if needed you can
even adjust the temperature of your
stove to ensure your food doesn't
overcook
leaves clogs bugs and other pests and
you've gutters to leave them would cause
water damage and over spills clean them
would swallow up a whole weekend that is
until now the irobot lose 300 series
gutter cleaning robot cause it must have
tool for your home maintenance Arsenal
luge takes this dangerous and dirty job
and does it for you
no more repeated ladder climbing no more
overreaching from dangerous Heights
no more Sunday's wasted simply place
luge into the gutter using the
detachable handle and let the robot get
to work
spinning at 500 rpm the high-velocity
four stage augur breaks apart clogs then
lifts and throws them away from your
roof as sweepers and a scraper clear the
remaining debris and make sure the path
is cleared for the robot to travel luge
gets its power from a long-lasting
lithium-ion battery giving it the muscle
needed to handle your gutters luge can
be used in either automatic clean mode
or manual mode in clean mode just push
the clean button and lose travel down
your gutter on its own sensing and
adapting to debris to provide the most
effective cleaning manual mode allows
you to control the robots forward in
reverse directions using the detachable
handle which doubles as the remote
control at just under 2 inches high and
3 inches wide luge fits in most case
tile gutters this low-profile design
allows luge to easily travel under most
gutter straps and over downspout holes
luge cleans gutters faster than
traditional methods cleaning up to a 30
foot section of gutter in about 5
minutes doing this manually takes five
times longer on average the robots
waterproof design is not only critical
for clearing wet leaves but also makes
for an easy clean up using your garden
hose luge comes complete with an
additional set of smaller more compact
objectives allowing you to customize
your auger for varying types of debris
found in different seasons or conditions
Lew's reduces the risk of injury from
repetitive climbing and extended time on
ladders and also helps to prevent
overreaching from dangerous heights the
slip resistant rubber handle and
hands-free belt clip combined for safer
ladder climbing and robot handling
iRobot is driven by a passion for
building practical robots like luge that
make a meaningful difference in people's
lives the iRobot lose 300 series gutter
cleaning robot takes a dangerous dirty
job and does it for you introducing MIMO
the intelligent robotic lawn mower from
Honda memo's revolutionary high-tech
design revolves around something very
special you because MIMO automatically
Clips your lawn with computerized
precision so that every blade of grass
is always well manicured and beautiful
giving you more free time to do
everything you want to including
absolutely nothing at all MIMO is
brought to life with decades of Hondas
passion for innovation technology
robotics and engineering and built with
a Honda quality you expect and trust me
Moe is fully customizable to your yard
and your lifestyle
just tell me moe when and where to mow
and it does the rest including
automatically returning to its docking
station your honda MIMO dealer will
conduct a yard survey and set boundary
wires around your lawn and existing
landscaping such as trees flowerbeds
ponds and outbuildings
so MIMO knows exactly where to mow and
were not to mow as a decidedly high-tech
device MIMO is autonomous and can be
programmed with three cutting patterns
to suit your needs
random for large open areas
directional for narrower obstacle-free
areas or mixed for large complex yards
plus MIMO is intelligent and can be
programmed to automatically adapt to the
season and grass growth rates delivering
the best cutting finish for your yard
MIMO can even detect thicker grass areas
activating its spiral cutting pattern to
tackle these zones while its edge
cutting mode will keep the boundary wire
area looking neat me mow mows frequently
shaving tiny pieces of grass sir your
yard is always well maintained and
manicured and it's good for your grass
too those tiny pieces fertilize and
promote a healthier lawn and because
MIMO is electric it's quiet and can be
programmed to run day or night so in
addition to being efficient it's also
stealthy with its 360-degree awareness
sensors a MIMO can work safely and
securely it continually monitors for
boundary wires and can detect any
tilting or lifting motion automatically
stopping its blades and if nemo's bump
sensors detect any obstacles in its path
MIMO will change directions and then
keep mowing worried about theft don't be
if someone picks up MIMO an alarm sounds
and MIMO stops working until you enter
your custom pin code it's easy to learn
more about memos to available models 3
cutting patterns specially designed
blades 360 degrees sensors automatic
charging system and day and night modes
all making your life in your lawn care
