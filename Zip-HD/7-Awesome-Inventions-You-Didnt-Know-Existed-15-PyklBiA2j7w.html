connect this with this why because this
has like 1 million awesome games for it
and this is a huge screen so they
invented different Android TV games the
problem were the controller it turns out
that touch games are actually meant to
be played with you know touch then they
tried using the smartphone itself as a
controller but that just led them
staring at the phone screen at the huge
TV and might as well have been a goat
they even crowdfunded the special
Android gaming console for TV and people
are like oh yeah but then they used it
and they were like oh yeah it had no
touch and only had like 50 games we want
201 million of them so now these awesome
geeks are proud to present the
controller that enables you to touch the
TV screens on the couch without looking
at it they call it zero zeros deep touch
technology brings mobile games as they
are to any TV it's a seamless experience
because of one main thing the unique
hoverpad controller why is it so unique
the Z touch multi hover technology
mirrors the position of your fingers
onto the TV when they float above the
controller zero special indicators will
show you the location of your fingers on
the screen and the distance they are
from the past this way your eyes stay on
the TV and you know exactly where you're
going to touch giving you the exact same
intuitive experience you have on mobile
devices how does it work z touch is a
projected self-capacitance space
technology that can detect conductive
objects like fingers up to 1.2 inch
above the see touch sensor we've been
developing this technology for three and
a half years and boy have we patented it
the zero box comes with a powerful
quad-core processor and dedicated
graphics unit that deliver smooth
lightning-fast graphics up to 4k the
controllers motion sensor completes the
gaming experience with a zero box
existing and future games
the Google Playstore can be downloaded
and instantly used in exactly the same
way as on smartphones for tablets no
extra costs no modifications just play
out of the box plus you can use all
those other stuff too
agua is an innovative IP x3 storm proof
camera carrier designed to enable quick
drying of your camera
agua is lightweight comfortable and
designed from the finest durable
materials while other camera bags come
with rain covers that provide limited
protection from water agua gives your
camera excellent protection even in
pouring rain there are numerous
weatherproof camera bags on the market
but drawing a camera from them is a slow
and awkward process in contrast a Gua
lets you quick dry your camera in any
weather so you'll never miss a shot agua
provides double layer protection against
water and impact thanks to an outer
layer of waterproof tarpaulin and an
inner layer of neoprene and lycra trying
to adjust the length of the strap on
most camera bags is slow and trickier
while agua offers quick and easy
adjustment for the best fit with only
one hand the Aguas padded strap is
lightweight yet sturdy and designed to
withstand extreme conditions and we mean
extreme
regular camera straps let you respond
quickly but they also leave the camera
exposed to damage on the other hand a
gua is always protected and ready to
shoot and here's another cool thing with
agua you don't need your camera strapped
at all the camera is attached to the
back with quick-release buckle to
protect it from falling when needed
simply disconnect the buckle and shoot
as you please
we designed the front lens protector to
be rigid on the outside but padded on
the inside
this allows you to leave the lens cap
off and keep your camera ready for
action and if you really need a regular
camera strap you got it simply
disconnect the camera from the carrier
and connect it to the strap now all you
have to do is connect the carrier to
your bag or even your bike a gua comes
in three different sizes for mirrorless
cameras mid size DSLRs and pro DSLRs
they are all designed to offer IP x3
storm-proof standard without
compromising on quick-draw ability you
don't need to be a pro to enjoy the ag-1
it's designed for everyone anywhere for
all of life's special moments worried
about nasty sand and splashes of salty
water relax even when you go to the
beach you can trust a gloss excellent
protection
we even designed a special pocket for
the lens cover so you'll never lose it
again

in 1996 the air force approached us we
were three professors I can't State
University's liquid-crystal Institute
and they asked us to see if we can
create a technology that will allow a
pilot or a soldier going into a building
to adapt to the different environmental
conditions as fast as they can that
means that in the dark state it needs to
be like sunglass and in the clear state
as clear as possible it took us about 17
years to create it and we've invested
close to 40 million dollars to create
this technology it will allow a person
to be able to control the amount of
lights that hits them and went to him
I'm convinced the control we
revolutionized eyewear industry had them
on automatic mode and I said it's not
gonna work but I went to a darker place
where I was about to grab my glass and
take them dock instant at clear lenses
if you go for an easy ride it's nice to
play a little bit clearer in a race
it's not safe to take your hand off the
bar I will tear it down automatic mode
as soon as I leave the bus it's
extraordinary that this piece of
equipment designed for US Special Forces
is available for any demanding consumer
for any athlete for anybody who wants to
enhance performance the product can be
customized in different ways for optimal
fit you can bend the sides and then
outspread second of all you can also
choose the color of the frame and the
color of the lens you can take two
hundred cyclists and let them try this
and they say this is fantastic
you
hi I'm Mitch I'm an industrial designer
at a small firm called human scope I've
been developing products now for about
10 years and one of the very first
products I worked on that went to market
was a night light night lights come in a
wide range of styles they all have the
same cheap materials lackluster
aesthetics and minimal functions with
all me we want to develop a nightlight
that has a wide range of functionality
that not only looks great in your home
but it's made and designed well like
most other night lights omie has an l vr
sensor in it which allows the lights
come on automatically when it gets dark
however only also has fully adjustable
RGB LED lights which offer over 16
million color options via the Omiya
the Apple also let you turn only on or
off
dim or brighten the light set timers and
more
unlike traditional night lights only is
better it has a built-in rechargeable
battery which means when the power goes
out your only stays on it also means you
can take all me with you or put it on
your child's bedside table so when they
wake up in the middle of the night they
can take on those monsters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
