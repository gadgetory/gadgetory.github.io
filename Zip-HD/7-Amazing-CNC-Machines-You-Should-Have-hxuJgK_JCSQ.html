the power of a 1 and a quarter
horsepower in female a laser cutter from
the 3d printer has an all-in-one machine
each tools exist as a rabbit a snatcher
providing the user the abilities with
bill laser printers crucial focus our
vision is to break the barriers maker by
equipping them with the creative power
of a personal machine shop that's small
portable and easy to use while immersed
in a thriving startup ecosystem sister
my brother and I discussed in these
boxes here we join a rich maker and gave
access to specialized manufacturing
tools accessible Fab Lab the makerspace
like that shot we were inspired by the
powerful new tools and access the
manufacturing level regime is offered by
maker spaces and we wanted more so we
focused our attention on creating
experience of high quality desktop tools
that embody the precision and the
features that were once only accessible
water with a purpose of making those
machines available to Christ makers
inventors too
and divider can afford and thus foxy was
born foxy has the precision and
reliability of a professional machine
with an industry-leading movement
resolution of four microns resource
industrial balls manufactured all live
in Okolona and add stainless steel
hardware and then assemble them into an
all aluminum anodized body creating the
sturdiest master machine on the market
and one accessible to the average maker
boss you can shape those materials you
can source the plastics the hardwoods
metal boxes intrude personal management
allowing creators who is rapidly through
design encouraged and empowering small
businesses produce individualize
products except boxy gifts fabricators
the ability to fuse message switching
rapidly from 3d printing is TMC milling
the laser cutting is very things
opponent to accomplish this we design
box key to integrate all free tools to
one clean easy use interface you foxy is
precise durable and reliable and so easy
to use that fresh makers can create
complex patronum with boxing weak
decouple professional quality date
location and decentralize the power of
precision manufacturing boxes and mobile
success topping these evil ones with
insi machine made for anyone if you are
a maker designer or company it doesn't
matter you will be able to express your
creativity and give life to complex
process in just 2 simple set with
everyone you can meet any material
plastic boots aluminium brass PCB and
many others the softer form is to use
even quite easily
furthermore thanks to the preview you
will control the process in real time
through the display you will have the
possibility of quickly position the
material with high precision
you just need to draw your ideas to the
materials and start the manufacturing
process everyone is is to you beautiful
and powerful you will produce real
sturdy object with the best quality
step craft is the next generation of
desktop creative tools it will inspire
you by allowing you to go from idea to
reality in just minutes we all have
great ideas and bringing them to life is
now possible for everyone step crap is
different because it can transform from
one CNC machine into another in seconds
creating things has never been easier to
show you we've broken it down into three
easy steps first design your project now
we know that no one likes learning
difficult software so we made step craft
work seamlessly with top-rated programs
you already know in love it doesn't
matter if you're using CAD software or
programs like Inkscape or coral jaws
subcraft is universal second choose your
material and tool with over seven
completely different interchangeable
tools available you'll never run out of
possibilities and the machine will never
become obsolete
click start the machine will make it for
you it's never been easier to go from
idea to finished product and no tool
gives you more options or capabilities
you can use the 3d print head for rapid
prototyping or to make thousands of
useful projects that you can use every
day
turn your Dremel into a precision 3d
Carver and mill a high-power spindle
makes quick work of materials like
aircraft aluminum carbon fiber wood and
of course plastic as a breeze the hot
wire cutter makes working with difficult
materials like foam sheet effortless and
it gets professional results in seconds
step craft will change the way you think
we've all spent countless hours trying
to make things by the end and manually
holding a tool is far from precise and
can often be dangerous whether you're a
modeler a business owner or a parent
looking to give your child the ultimate
creative tool step craft is the key to
unlocking imagination innovation and
success step craft was designed in
Germany with three goals in
first they wanted to create the highest
quality all-in-one CNC machines possible
all parts are designed and manufactured
to aerospace tolerances in many
components our hand fit from the factory
second it had to be easy to build and
simple to operate assembly takes just a
few hours and as a pleasure because of
the world-class manual that takes you
through every step of the way three it
had to be affordable step craft with all
the optional parts cost far less than
what you may expect what we've ended up
with is a machine that's beautiful quiet
clean incredibly accurate yet it gives
you limitless freedom to create the
Creation Station is a CNC router kit
designed from the ground up to be both
high quality and high performance but
also affordable to anyone unlike 3d
printing CNC is a mature technology that
has been around for many years and is
widely used in manufacturing
unfortunately today CNC machines are
only available in either expensive
high-end commercial models or low-end
consumer grade models that lack the
capabilities and performance to make
them very useful we are about to change
all that
we designed the creation station from
the ground up to deliver exceptional
performance that is comparable to
machines costing thousands of dollars
but we bring it to you at a price you
can actually afford our goal is to
finally bring the powerful capabilities
of CNC into the mainstream we couldn't
be happier with the result and we know
you will be too
most consumer CNC machines have a tiny
work area that severely limits the kind
of project you can work on not so with
the creation station which features a
massive 24 inch by 24 inch by 5 inch
work area this large work area allows
you to make a much wider range of really
cool stuff unlike 3d printers which
limit you to small plastic trinkets the
creation station is able to shape any
material softer than steel
including foam circuit boards wood
plastic aluminum brass stone ceramic
even glass you name it if you can fit it
in the Machine and it's softer than
steel the creation station can shape it
the creation station also has features
typically seen only on much more
expensive commercial CNC machines such
as ball bearing lead screws that are
extremely durable and highly efficient
deliver more torque and higher feed
ratings the creation station also uses
20 millimeters thick linear rails for
exceptional rigidity accuracy and
durability the creation station supports
a one-horsepower router driven by three
powerful NEMA 23 stepper motors and a
custom design controller board that
utilizes the latest driver technology
from Texas Instruments the creation
station comes in an easy to assemble kit
that anyone can put together in only a
few hours it's easy to set up and use we
provide complete end-to-end instructions
to get you up and running fast we
believe designers are ready to move
beyond plastic
we want to be able to work with more
materials organic materials like wood
followeth like aluminum but we need to
do over this
the tools that can get work done a tool
that leaves superior finish we need a
tool that courage millions of angle
we need a tool for the planet of detail
the tool that makes our lives easier
introducing the pocket empathy the burst
5-axis milling machine design for your
desktop till we can draw in c2 favorite
pencil market and create intricate
drawings of these till we can cut
quickly make dick health and science
just like professionals truly can spend
a fun unique feature who you can laser
cut powerful 2.5 watt laser prints are a
variety of materials including card
exactly and wood tool we can engrave
intricate graphics and photos are
accurately engraved on material such as
wood leather and fruit to Lee campaign
the airbrush tool allows you to create
works of art was eaten then with any
surface express yourself on a t-shirt or
personalize the gift for a friend
truly kingdoms been have fun making
edible creations or create a stained
glass look with ease make a gasket will
be creative with clay truly can pick and
place position objects to create a
mosaic picture or have some fun with
your kids at robotics we're passionate
about CNC and we want the world to know
that this technology offers more than
just 3d printing that's why we developed
Tully Cooley is a plotter an airbrush a
laser a dispenser and offered em as
possibilities as an all-in-one robotic
tool over the past year we've worked
hard to bring Tory to the pre-production
stage first we developed a unique frame
designers both efficient and scalable
this allows for a decent size creative
space
then we designed an accurate and safe
means of swapping out tools an important
feature for multi-tool creation next we
designed an intuitive touchscreen
interface and a world full of smart
phone can tablet Patrol we had to have
the touchscreen with clearly having so
many unique features we had to develop
Altona software support orders as you
can see we've worked hard over the past
12 months using plenty of late night but
now we're ready to portfolium production
to do this we need your help there's a
lot of cost associated bringing a
product like tule to the market and we
cannot do it without you please back up
and join the Tauri revolution
we are designed to make a propeller
mouth would make a revolution and if
power to create an experiment using
desktop fabrication machines at the same
time was felt restricted by currently
available desktop machine The Apprentice
are limited in material choice click
long time to print and since females are
limited in geometry it can produce
that's why we've started this project
and designed a new type of depth of
publication machine 5-axis milling is
considered most advanced and fastest
fabrication technology and it's made
affordable now this machine unlike 3d
printer does not realize specific
material and this work even material
cost all you do is take Radio available
material officials
five axes maker is machine that combines
all common industrial fabrication
technologies and puts it on your desktop
now that we have a fully functional
bioactive platform
our goal is developers that have
changeable tools that can go in this
machine the way it works is simple you
can change from one tool to another and
Urich today
seventy-five actually you can decide
subscribe when he made object specific
application you can 3d print a much
biggest form
there's a possibility to add different
particles and that just a faction way to
do the weight of potential application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
