efficiency we seem to have lost our
ability to play and it's a feeling that
we personally miss we believe happiness
has something to do with playing and
having fun and that includes going out
and being active so we've created a new
vehicle to awaken your natural instinct
to move a vehicle that trains your
balance and reflexes in a completely new
way one that distracts you for a moment
from your day-to-day worries and allows
you to focus solely on your body and the
ride itself and the result is an
experience far better than we ever
expected meet the half buddy

portability can turn just about any

Jarra bike is the easiest and quickest
way to learn how to ride a high school
using a jar by kids can learn a ride
without training wheels or stabilizers
and when a ride in one afternoon as far
as a child learning the Rider bike
confidences is everything having a
product that it gives that stability
from the outset could really fast-track
child's development and confidence in
cycling I mean as far as I'm concerned
the the gyro bike is the paperclip of
the bicycle world I mean why is it why
is nobody on it before it's such a
brilliant concept well any spinning disc
is a gyroscope it's just a matter of
what you do with the gyroscope to put it
to work for you when you spin a disc it
creates a force it doesn't want to move
off its axis what we do is we turn it on
its side and when this spinning disc is
tilted it actually turns the wheel so
that the child can continue riding
upright I could see the opportunity here
not just for children but started to
think about how this technology could
help more people
a lot of children with disability get
left behind and therefore something that
people take for granted like riding a
bike and not being a twelve-year-old
with stabilizers would give them so much
confidence
Gani go well done you
that's the furthest well up the first
time she's ever actually got on a bike
and been able to ride out here I think
it's really fascinating when you see the
gyro bike for the first time and that it
doesn't fall over and that's really
revolutionary I haven't seen anything
like that before
it must be fantastic for a child's
confidence when they're learning how to
cycle

rugged and easy to use it represents a
whole new way to fly

just how it will be to fly the
full-scale hover bow and will help with
raising the funds needed to bring the
hover bike to market we have moved to a
proven quadcopter design and this is
what our second-generation hover bike
looks like trains should be friendly and
approachable l drone has ducks around
