disco bed my name is soon park founder
of I camper and creator of the sky camp
in 2009 my family and I hit the road and
covered 58,000 miles all across North
America over three years I was traveling
with my wife and two daughters and we
weren't satisfied with the comfort of a
traditional tent or the time to pitch it
we settled on a pop-up trailer but it
was a drag and a pain to set up after
going back home I found it I camper and
after many tests prototypes and
improvements on our previous three model
my team and I are proud to have found
the answer
introducing the sky camp the world's
first expandable hard shell rooftop tent
as featured in tech insider The Sunday
Times Lonely Planet insider design G
gadgets Mashable Asia and Business
Insider the sky camp is truly
exceptional it is a treehouse dream come
true
except that it is bigger mobile and more
comfortable it is made for life on the
road so you can take off whenever stop
wherever and fall asleep looking up at
the stars the sky camp is of the highest
quality so you can keep camping in your
rooftop tent night after night
waterproof tent fabric a fiber
reinforced hard shell top aluminum or
stainless steel metal components to
prevent rust we did not sacrifice
quality for price the sky camp is
perfect for a family trip or a road trip
with friends it can fit two adults and
two children or three adults the
extension floor folds out to reveal a
comfortable king-sized mattress
made of high density memory foam pillows
and bedding can conveniently be left
inside the tent when you close it
worried about weight high camper takes
safety seriously the floor is made of
aluminum honeycomb panels that are
extremely strong and can hold up to 900
pounds the sky camp weighs only 150
pounds including the ladder and mattress
so two people can easily mount it within
a few minutes its Universal mounting
system and light weight make it
compatible with most crossbars or roof
racks
we know how difficult and annoying it
can be to pitch a tent open a pop-up
trailer or soft top roof tent only to
have to pack it up the next morning day
after day the sky camp can be set up
easily in less than a minute one person
can open it on his or her own and
closing it is just as simple you love
your car and we wanted it to look just
as good with a rooftop tent mounted on
it the sky camp's fiber reinforced
hardshell is aerodynamic lightweight and
available in glossy black or white want
more customize your sky camp by adding
an awning to protect you from the rain
or Sun an annex room to hang out in or
store gear a rack to keep your shoes dry
and away from bugs and animals hanging
storage shelves or wind deflector the
sky camp is my dream come true and now I
want to share it with you embark on your
own journey and follow your dreams
although traveling light and small is
always an issue in the backcountry and
on road trips some trips deserve more
than the absolute minimalist approach
