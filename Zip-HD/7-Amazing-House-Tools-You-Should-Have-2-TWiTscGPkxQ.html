hi Dan with home right I'm going to show
you how to set up and use a quick
painter the quick painter is a trimming
tool that has a pad a trigger and a fill
handle to fill it we're gonna remove the
pad attachment and put the tip of the
quick painter into our paint we're gonna
depress the trigger pull back on the
fill handle and wait for a moment while
it fills with paint when it's full we
release the trigger we're gonna wipe off
the excess paint from the fill tube
and now we can put the Pat attachment
back on
I like the Pat attachment opposite of
the trigger and I'll show you why
there's a little air in here so we'll
want to purge that and what we'll do is
we'll want to hold a rag in front of it
and we'll push the trigger and you'll
hear that air come out and now we're
ready to go you can see the paint it's
coming out beginning to come out with
the holes now we're going to use the
quick painter to cut it along this
window to do that I'm going to put the
edge there's a guide on the edge of the
pad here right up against the trim on
the window I'm gonna give the trigger a
little push to feed a little paint as I
do that I'm gonna move it up and down to
work the paint into the pad now is I
need a little paint
I'll give the trigger a push and just
working it in I can cut right up to the
edge of the window
after edging is complete you can remove
the pad attachment depress the trigger
and return unused paint back into the
can this will save paint and speed
cleanup
now we're ready to clean up I have a
wash tub with some warm soapy water here
I'm gonna put the pad attachment in and
let that silk I'll rinse that out next
I'm going to show you how to clean up
the handle we're going to hold the
trigger and pull water up into the
handle give it a shake to help loosen
the paint then press the trigger to
discharge the water
we're gonna change the water rinse out
the pad and then we can drive everything
off and reassemble it and we'll be ready
for an excuse
