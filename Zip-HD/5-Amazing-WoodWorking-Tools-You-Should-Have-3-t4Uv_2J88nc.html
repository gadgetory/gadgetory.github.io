STR the revolutionary portable
workstation and storage center designed
to get the most out of your miter saw
does it feel like every time you start a
project you struggle to find space in
your crowded workshop the Fordham 840
cube STR is your solution to a crowded
workspace the Porta Cube STRs compact
footprint is uniquely designed for
portable storage of your miter saw and
when fully expanded it will provide up
to 7 feet of working surface using the
universal tool mounts almost any size
miter saw can be attached to the porter
cube STRs unique rotating base
heavy-duty 10 inch wheels and a
retractable locking handle makes moving
simple and easy when you're ready to get
to work your miter saw easily rotates
from its stored position and locks
securely in place side extension wings
and adjustable tool tables raise and
lock into position and adjustable feet
can be used for leveling on uneven
surfaces with the porter cube SPR fully
expanded you are ready to start making
cuts with your miter saw
when cutting is complete rotate yourself
back into storage and the porta cube SGR
transforms into a 7-foot work surface
perfect we're working on additional
projects you may have when your work is
finished simply return the Porto cube
SPR to its compact size raise the
retractable handle and easily roll it
back into storage ready for your next
project the Porter cube SPR is the
perfect complement to your miter saw or
other tabletop tools
compact in size it expands to a portable
workstation and makes miter saw use and
storage in your crowded workshop more
efficient different tools make different
chips or sawdust routers and planers
make larger shavings and although they
may be easier to clean up than the finer
dust of saws of Sanders those larger
chips spread debris over a larger area
in a very short time with the sander the
size of the dust particle coming off it
about the same size as the grid on the
sandpit so the finer the paper the finer
the dust to find that the dust the more
it contaminates the area in ways that
are both seen and unseen what is seen is
sanding swarf left on the surface which
has to be removed before any finish can
take place what is unseen are the
smaller particles that hang in the air
for hours or even days in the workshop
this means these particles later descend
unfinished surfaces on a jobsite like
someone's home that dust gets into and
onto every surface it gets into
appliances and electronics it gets into
the HVAC system and it gets into their
lungs while they sleep no one likes to
live through a remodeling job because of
the mess and the disturbance the
nuisance of dust is one disturbance that
can be greatly minimized through proper
dust extraction in the shop or a home
dust control can't be an afterthought
not if you want to save yourself the
time cost and mess of dealing with it
later dust control is an integral part
of the Festool system and design
philosophy
by collecting the dust as it's made
where's me for us as painters the
Festool system has three components the
Sanders the abrasives and the extractors
the dust extractor is the heart and soul
of the system we don't have to put up
boundaries within a workspace anymore
because we are able to work that clean
nine times out of 10 we will get
compliments about how clean the job was
this tool offers a full line of dust
extractors optimized for the way you
work the CT mini and CT mini are fest
tools most portable dust extractors the
CT 26 CT 36 and CT 48 our Festool is
most capable and versatile mobile dust
extractors all of these units feature
HEPA filters and carry full unit have
the certification good dust extraction
starts at the tool and ends with clean
air being returned to the room for
Festool dust extraction is the primary
consideration of the tools design
whether it is our jet stream and multi
jet stream pad designs for our Sanders
are the efficient internal shrouding and
channeling that makes our tools able to
capture the dust as it happens just tool
dust extractors have many features one
features the tool triggered auto start
capability
whenever the tool is cycled on the
vacuum attached to it powers up
automatically as well likewise when the
tool is cycled off the vacuum also
cycles off another quality to consider
includes variable suction force the
ability to control airflow as it's
needed this is particularly critical for
sanding operation the hose connection is
designed to mate with all the different
port types on all our power tools this
detail means you have secure connections
and don't need to waste time with
makeshift solutions the Cystic feature
turns the CT into a mobile
transportation you can easily stacked
the cure and move an entire set of tools
at one time which gets you into and out
of a job site faster and the shop that
contributes to workplace organization
which enhances efficiency by keeping the
tools where you work unlike traditional
canister style vacuums the CT dust
extractors feature a flat filter and
containment area
flat design enables greater capacity by
keeping the filter out of a containment
area when used in conjunction with
Festool self-cleaning filter bags the
flat design allows the filter bag to
function in a way that helps prevent
clogging of the bag for greater airflow
to ensure maximum suction performance a
sealing gasket on the head unit creates
a tight seal which prevents leakage or
loss of suction the parking brake can be
easily engaged in unlocked with the foot
and provides a stable platform whenever
needed
cleaning sets further expand the dust
extractor platform by providing several
options including large diameter hoses
for increased air flow nozzles crevice
tools tubes and floor sweeps there are
many other accessories that can amplify
the function of the CT dust extractors
the boom on keeps the hose off the
material and out of the way ensuring
that the surface is protected while dust
is being extracted the work center keeps
all the tools and other things you need
at the place of work which reduces time
loss searching for tools and that
provides more time to get the work done
the dust extractors are phenomenal our
first tool is the Domino and that's
actually hogging out a giant hole we
thought surely we ran out to blow out
all the mortises or dump a mile before
we go and it's completely clean the
mortise is totally done ready for good
incredible because that dust extraction
is always pulling it up you don't run
the risk of having little granules make
marks in your lumber or a chunk of
sawdust putting a streak in it - so
amazing I was introduced to the festival
line at the end of 2012 since then I
would use no other tools I've gotten rid
of all of my other dust extraction
systems I've got rid of all of my other
sanding equipment I'm confident that I'm
going to get the results that I want in
the shop or a home dust control can't be
an afterthought not if you want to save
yourself the time costs and mess of
dealing with it later Festool offers a
wide range of dust extraction solutions
to minimize cleanup improve finish
results and work more efficiently than
ever
removal in your scroll saw can cut in
two different directions with three
different blade configurations take on
projects of any size with the when
16-inch variable speed to the directions
for all saw cut in the standard
direction towards the back of the table
as you would on a regular swirl song or
swaths of his blade over to the
90-degree position for infinite ripping
capacity you can also drill a pilot hole
into your workpiece and slide in a
pinless blade attach the Ultra Grip
blade holders to either side and mount
them to the scroll saw for intricate
internal cuts these specially designed
blade holders are easy to install while
also preventing the blade from coming
loose
variable speed can be adjusted anywhere
from 550 to 1600 strokes per minute with
the turn speed adjustment knob bevel to
16 by 11 inch worktable up to 45 degrees
all while keeping your cut eliminated
with a flexible work life on board blade
storage helps keep track of your blades
and adapters making them easy to find
and organized the adjustable air pump
combined with the one and a half inch
dust work.you sawdust out of your line
of vision and minimize cleanup with the
wind 16-inch two direction variable
speed scroll saw you're no longer
constrained by the throat of the saw
allowing for larger work pieces and more
creative opportunities remember when you
cut out a two-foot penguin yo wassup
penguin building something for your
loved ones is one of the most rewarding
experiences life has to offer and it's
never been more important to work safer
and smarter at your craft
microjig introduces grippers 3d plus
clock and it's the safest most precise
push block giving you essential safety
precision and control when feeding work
through a table saw a must-have for any
table saw user it gives you the three
critical forces when cutting on the saw
downward pressure to virtually eliminate
kickback and keep the workpiece down on
the tabletop
inward pressure to keep the work against
the fence and prevent Woodburn and
forward pressure to advance the cut and
control both sides of the workpiece the
gripper is engineered with a powerful
gripping surface that gives you far
greater control and traction and the saw
blade tunnel allows the table saw blade
to pass through keeping your hands
shielded the entire cut and the
adjustable Center leg slides easily to
accommodate a wide range of cutting
dimensions and keeps a solid hold of the
offcut material using the gripper is
simple and safe place the gripper on
your workpiece slide it against the
fence and guide to cut along the fence
and you'll get a safe cut the gripper is
a fully adjustable push block system
engineered to handle the demands of your
workshop and your full range of projects
and it's amazing when it comes to
handling small work pieces the built in
balance support drops down and
stabilizes for narrow work material
keeping your gripper square to the fence
the workpiece gets full contact with the
gripping surface to ensure a smooth
clean and safe cut the precise quarter
inch leg makes the gripper the most
precise pusher in the world
the proprietary green grip is lined
across the length of the leg to make
sure you have a firm grasp over the
smallest pieces of wood allowing you to
cut down to a quarter inch by quarter
inch all the while your hands are
protected with the gripper you have your
own moving blade guard the gripper is an
extremely versatile piece of woodworking
equipment we've also introduced gripper
advanced comes with two additional
precision accessories the stabilizing
plate gives you two hundred and fifty
percent more stabilizing area and locks
the workpiece against the fence to
enhance the versatility of the gripper
it intelligently maintains even pressure
without binding to create safer and
virtually burnfree cuts the adjustable
spacer adds one inch of additional
gripping surface to tackle larger
material and wider cuts they both work
remarkably well on the router table the
gripper holds the workpiece tight
against the router bit while the
stabilizing plate keeps you grounded and
moving smoothly across the table perfect
for free
routing the adjustable spacer is
reversible and rises up to give you
extra clearance to pass over the router
bit when doing full profile work like
bullnose Rohtak this takes care of any
uneven deep cuts on the back end of the
wood helping you make the most of every
piece no matter what project you're
taking on the gripper will give you the
control you need with the precision to
win over your biggest fans with the
gripper everything is safer there are
over 30 unique applications
substantially more than any other push
block you can use to grippers gripping
stock longer over 16 inches to virtually
eliminate burning and protect both hands
from working on bigger projects you can
cut a wide range of material types and
sizes and then recreate your stunning
results with consistency without having
to readjust your fence you can build
more projects in less times with less
waste and much safer whether you're
making something for a magical moment or
building something to last a lifetime
work safer work smarter
the drawer slide jig from Craig makes it
easier than you've ever imagined to
build projects with drawers which means
you can create projects you might have
only dreamed of before that's because
the drawer slide jig takes the guesswork
and uncertainty out of installing drawer
slides and makes it easier for anyone to
install drawers that fit right and
glides smoothly every time the drawer
slide jig does this by securely
supporting the slide in the exact
position needed as you install them in
the cabinet plus the jig supports the
drawer boxes as well to ensure that the
slides get installed on them with
perfect alignment - whether you're
installing drawers in a cabinet with
face frames or in a cabinet or piece of
furniture without frames the versatile
drawer slide jig clamps in place easily
and the jig works with ball bearing
epoxy coated and under mount slides
using the drawer slide jig couldn't be
simpler
built-in Tam's register the jigs
brackets in place precisely just align
the tabs with a face frame and then
clamp the bracket in place this
positions the bracket exactly where you
needed to place the jig at the right
height and does it without measuring
ensuring foolproof level positioning of
the slide on frameless cabinets in cases
the process is still simple the brackets
register against the front edge of the
cabinet and clamp in place at the layout
line sitting straight and level every
time once clamped in place the jigs
blanket support the drawer slide
completely providing that third hand
you've always needed to hold the slides
in place no matter how big or heavy the
slide the drawer slide jig holds it in
straight and level so you have both
hands-free to drive in the screws and
the drawer slide jig doesn't stop there
after all the job isn't complete until
the drawer box itself is aligned and
installed that's why the jigs brackets
are reversible so they can be mounted to
protrude out of the cabinet and hold
that drawer box in the exact right
position that allows you to set the
drawer box on the brackets and then pull
the slides into position the sturdy
brackets hold everything in place as you
drive in the mounting screws with the
correct drawer slide jig you'll have the
confidence you need to take your
projects to the next level and create
custom pieces with drawer
because you'll know that you can create
drawers that look great fit correctly
and work right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
