word for what we do it's not tradition
the wall craft is timeless
limitless is too limiting
and Deering is not enduring enough
innovation
only begin to describe it
we sculpt
paint and explore
but explorers sculptors and painters we
are not this is the only thing we make
the only thing we will ever
there is no word for what we do there is
only the movement of the sea an
elemental force ceaseless and eternal
and a powerful inspiration for the
audiology of Uli's nada
since 1846 when a visionary you listener
Don embarked on his journey into time
with his pocket chronometer x' the
dynamic movement of the sea has given
life to his dream to chart a singular
course in mechanical watchmaker to
navigate the imagination
to push back the limits of time driven
by the perpetual motion of the scene to
create develop and manufacture
innovative in-house mechanisms that
redefine the notion of a mechanical
timepiece and confirm you least Nevada
as an audacious adventurer in the world
of o't philosophy sometimes the greatest
achievements take place on the smallest
scale a hundred and eighty years ago
Antoine de Kouta revolutionized
watchmaking by inventing the first
instrument to measure the micron inside
Anton's unique manufacture the most
brilliant advances in watchmaking are
made in the same pioneering spirit of
the founder

inventions that are at the very pinnacle
of watchmaking

artisans and experts strive to affect

there is perhaps no finer moment than
what they can offer a connoisseur the
pleasure of a discovery
a hundred eighty years of Parsons
Antoine founded the manufacturer with
all crafts under one roof

spirit of invention is stronger than
ever
we are Zulu culture Shibata here the
present a lovefool astride show Paulo is
very proud to present the full strike
our latest minute repeated as in any
properly designed minute repeater this
complication raised two main challenges
firstly the volume of the chimes and
secondly the purity of their sound in
order to best amplify the notes we
decided to use the watch's crystal
itself as an acoustic amplifier the
molecular properties of the Sapphire
confer an extremely pure and crystalline
sound to the chimes to ensure that the
vibrations be transmitted as directly as
possible from the gongs to the crystal
we came up with a unique solution which
was to couple them using a built-in
component the idea of a monoblock
crystal was born an extraordinary amount
of calculation was invested in the
dimensioning of the energy delivered by
the Hammers when they strike the gongs
so as to retain from the crystal a sound
that is both strong and clear this is
the full strike by Shaba
the story begins in 1830 in the Swiss
juha when we Victor and SIL Istanbul
