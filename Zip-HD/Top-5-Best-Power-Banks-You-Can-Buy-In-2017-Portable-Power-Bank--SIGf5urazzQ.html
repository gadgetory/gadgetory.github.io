people flows River is a new generation
of smart clean mobile power it's a
portable lithium-ion battery with the
world's most comprehensive array of
charging ports and one of the highest
total energy output of almost any
storage solution on the market it's
designed for everybody from outdoor
activities and indoor leisure to
industrial applications and emergency
services River releases you from the
shackles of an outlet so you can power a
free life the unit is equipped with 11
independent charging ports which can all
be used simultaneously for a total
output of 500 watts to put this in
perspective that means a good power Q
iPhone 2 iPad 2 mass books a mini-fridge
the lantern a drone battery a mobile
Wi-Fi unit and stereo speakers all at
the same time without limiting the
output on any port with the storage
capacity of 416 watt hours River gives
you more powers than almost any battery
of the time
you can jam on your electrical card for
20 hours straight or you can watch a
ten-hour marathon at your favorite TV
show by campfire rivers battery can be
recharged in three different ways
a standard outlet or a car charger can
replenish the battery to full capacity
in just eight hours with eco flows
portable solar panels River can be
recharged with absolutely zero carbon
emissions in just 12 hours the real-time
display allows you to monitor the
battery's current output power remaining
capacity and charge time being a
documentary filmmaker a lot of my shoots
happen outside a lot of times our
locations are way out in the middle of
nowhere first time I use River I was
really surprised at how much these
little units can accomplish on location
everything runs on batteries we have to
set up a DI T station battery charging
station and we could even run our LEDs
when we need extra lights never have to
worry about the noise and the pollution
of a generator applications for battery
power are endless River isn't just an
accessory if your power companion for
harnessing clean energy anywhere so
you're free to go everywhere
and by the way this isn't just a concept
river has been tried and tested and as
you can see this entire production has
been lit by River introducing the
Jaffrey Palatine of the border 578 watt
hour generator designed to power
everything you take with you and keep
your adventure going with AP MVC Atlas
and two high speed USB port the power
pro allows you to charge in multiples of
isolation work with a massive passenger
than 78 watt hours of power the power
pro is the most powerful energy storage
solution in its class the power pro is
sold already
so your power will always last as long
as your adventure stick the onboard LED
screen give you real-time status of the
remaining charge and input an output
wattage and the internal smart
controller optimizes output and protects
your devices from surges overcharging
and overheating and it's great to have
at home as a backup as the power goes
out just because you're off the grid
doesn't mean you need to stop
discovering sharing Soren and capturing
memories
unlimited power opens a whole new world
to what's possible outside with one full
charge the Jaffrey power bro can run a
mini-fridge for ten hours an Ltd can be
for four hours recharge your own battery

forty five times keep all the devices
that help you enjoy the great outdoors
charged because it's not just about what
you see what happier without when you
take back with you

the things that truly matter to you and
I'm here today to introduce you guys to
the new line of lithium Yeti power
stations so I have here in front of me a
Yeti 1,400 lithium system and we built
the yeti line of products as a portable
power station so what that means is that
you can charge it from a variety of
sources like solar panels the wall
anything that produces electricity you
can effectively use to recharge the
battery that's inside of this product
and then you can take it with you on the
go or have it at home with backup powers
that allows you to use the stored
electricity in various ways that your
electrical products need for example we
have an AC port up front that powers
anything that you plug into the wall we
have a line of USB ports that recharges
mobile devices like cell phones and
tablets anything with a USB port and
then we also have a 12-volt accessory
port so anything that's designed to plug
into something like a car cigarette
lighter you can use this to power and
collectively what that means is you've
got this very versatile system where
anything that uses electricity you can
effectively plug into it and run it when
the power is out or when you're off the
grid and you need access to a
significant amount of stored energy so
some of the key features of this new
generation of power has to do with the
fact that it's a lithium based battery
and what that really means to you guys
is that it's a lighter easier to
transport physically smaller design it
took us a while to get into this because
it's really important for us to have a
really convenient and powerful but safe
product out there so we have the highest
quality cells we've engineered a lot of
sophistication into the battery
management system and have worked with
basically the best-in-class suppliers of
all the parts and pieces so that this
becomes a really safe system for the
lithium battery the other piece that
really matters is basically how do you
get the battery power that's stored in
there and transfer it out to something
usable the most important part of that
is basically this inverter the AC power
the part that looks and supposed to act
as much like your wall plug in your home
as possible and that's the inverter and
in this case it's a 1500 watt inverter
but another thing that's really
important on the inverter is something
that we are patenting called the
multistage surge protection every
inverter out there will have surge
protection of some kind and it's meant
to protect it from things that draw a
lot of power in a very short time and
that's usually things with motors like
fans or air conditioners or
refrigerators power tools things like
that and a lot of those things don't
typically work on inverters even though
they look like they should based on the
power rating and what our multi-stage
surge protection does is it adapts to
the thing that you plug in and open it
up as much as possible so you get the
most compatibility with AC powered
products and then the last thing is that
we decided to switch it's really good at
doing that it's very versatile dynamic
and for most people just getting this is
perfectly asked but we found that there
are some situations where people want to
expand and really focus on one type of
application and so what we've done is
we've built with some modularity and
expansion ports into the product and if
you open up the lid of what you'll see
here is that there's two modules and
these two modules can be basically
pulled out and replaced with something
after the fact so that it specializes
and works really well with a particular
application some examples of that are
over here we have an AC adapter the
thing that plugs into your wall to
charge the eddy
and that's stored in house right here
but if you wanted to upgrade that down
the road so it can charge faster from
the wall you could take that out and
place through place it with a high power
or fast charging module and then the
last thing is that basically we've
developed a lot of intelligence into the
product and one of those is access to
the different features on the front
panel a lot of people who have used our
yeti's before are used to our interface
but we've had a lot of interesting
things to it one of them is you can see
the watts coming in and what's going out
of the system so you can keep track of
how much power is flowing through it but
you've also got this basically time to
empty or time to full so if the system
is charging or you've got something
plugged into it you can get a feel for
how much time you can do that and run
for those are all in the front panel so
you've got these different interfaces
that let you switch between one mode and
another
one display in another and that's kind
of our intelligent intelligent interface
so this is where you get in the box you
get the base Yeti comes out ready to
work ready to run anything ready to
charge from the wall ready to be plugged
into solar panels and go that's our
system and I wanted to thank you for
taking the time to come to us today take
a look at the Yeti learn a little bit
about it
