time since people start using currency

different tastes but its primary
function remains unchanged football so

wallet for example when a thief is
stealing your fake wallets on your
pocket receive quality on your new
immediately but when you open the safe
folder by yourself to make payment or
when you go back home and put the safe
wallet on the table the safe wallet can
recognize you and won't make any noise
this is what we say smaller when the
stray bullet is warning you you could
easily cancel the warning by tapping the
safe wallet twice or simply keeping the
mobile phone close your safe wallet
if you leave your wallet behind your
total their information Oh if you leave
your phone behind your wallet will take

phone will now be responsible for each
other

seamless
