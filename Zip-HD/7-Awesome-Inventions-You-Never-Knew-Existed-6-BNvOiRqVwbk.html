your desk I mean really why are office
desks today well pretty much the same as
they've always been it's just four legs
holding up a piece of wood it's time to
completely redesign the office desk

interact with your lights thermostat and
many other devices can you bring down
the temperature no problem

way you work but also serve as an
amazing piece of modern furniture

office the ergonomic cut allows you to
rest your arms while working and USB
chargers are included for all your
devices the built-in wireless charger

phone's battery the height adjustments

settings and the bag hanger keeps your
possessions close at hand Taylor is

this is not a movie but an illustration
of a world-class smart briefcase

where the I'm brief is at all times in
any scenario on your mobile phone or
computer

safe for your files your fingerprint is
the key to the protected material inside

devices via the dual exposed USB ports

all the places and routes that it has
been for later analysis I'm brief is
wireless enabled you can store your data
without being physically tethered to it

afforded for road warriors like yourself
say hello to Bruno the world's first
send me an alert so I'll never miss
trash pickup again remind me what a low
on trash bags Wi-Fi connected now you
see it now you don't smart the kitchen
trash can
you
this is better back it allows you to
effortlessly sit in perfect posture
easing back pain and training yourself
how to sit use it when you're sitting at
your desk on an airplane watching a game
or even when you meditate let me show
you how it works better bag zips itself
into a portable case throw it in your
bag and unpack it when you're ready to
sit wrap the back pad around your back
and the knee straps around your knees
all there's left to do is to pull on the
adjustable leg straps to stack your
spine into perfect posture so if you're
going to spend nine hours of your day
sitting you might as well be doing it
right when you're pain free and your
body is perfectly aligned you feel
happier more confident and you regain
your ability to focus on whatever it is
you want out of life
the wallet has been around for a long
time since people start using currency
its appearance design varies to
different tastes but its primary
function remains unchanged football so
what if we add more practical features
based on its primary function to make it
more smarter and safer
let us introduce a revolutionary safe
wallet for example when a thief is
stealing your fake wallets on your
pocket receive quality on your new
immediately but when you open the safe
folder by yourself to make payment or
when you go back home and put the safe
wallet on the table the safe wallet can
recognize you and won't make any noise
this is what we say smaller when the
stray bullet is warning you you could
easily cancel the warning by tapping the
safe wallet twice or simply keeping the
mobile phone close your safe wallet
if you leave your wallet behind your
total their information Oh if you leave
your phone behind your wallet will take
to let you know your wallet and your
phone will now be responsible for each
other
we believe the technology should be
seamless
and it should give you more from the
experience as you will our technology
fundamentally enhances human capability
there's just a new evolution the store
again I think this is hot and it feels
like tomorrow it really really does it
feels like tomorrow you've taken all
that can electronics out of the the
high-tech cars and just put it right
here honestly it's it's gonna change
everything when you put on a skully
helmet you get an essentially an
ecosystem assuage eternity was hoping
into a platform
yeah that's something you get a level of
innovation that you had been fooled
about before being a professional
motorcycle racer takes a lot of fun away
from great from riding on the street but
this could make a fun again it will make
your riding safer with its high-speed
microprocessor and operating system it's
the smartest motorcycle helmet ever
