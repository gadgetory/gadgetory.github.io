Hecuba designed for happy reunion
design for her parents cats often suffer
from dehydration because they're finicky
about their food and water source water
quality and volume is vital to keep your
cat hydrated and healthy so we've
created pura pura is a smart water
feeder for cats it automatically
monitors and keeps track of how much
water your cat drinks the specially
shaped water bill allows your cats to
drink water without letting their
whiskers the hassle-free water changing
mechanism makes it easy for refills the
activated carbon filter allows your cat
always have fresh and healthy water to
drink if you have more than one kitten
no worries pura it's designed to work
and synchronize with multiple pira's for
multiple cats the pure app will provide
a friendly yet insightful health
reporting for your cat we've already
finished the pilot trial and we believe
by starting our cat's behavior
it's possible for us to help them live
healthier and longer and the key to this
is to bring pura into their lives
hey Kickstarter
my name is whit and I'd like to
introduce you to ticker a new and unique
tree chew toy for dogs ticker lets you
select the length of play from five to
45 minutes as the timer unwinds the
interval slowly lines up to the various
sized outer holes allowing the treats to
progressively fall out first the small
treats then the medium and finally the
large treat we create a ticker with our
two dogs re and Misha in mind after
spending years and a lot of money
searching for safe healthy and
long-lasting treat toys we were
disappointed to find there were no great
solutions out there so we set out to
develop a safe fun and exciting way to
keep our dogs engaged and entertained
for an extended period of time
we came up with tickers the design of
tickers simple and elegant but also
extremely fun for both you and your dog
the colors were specifically selected to
be high contrast and exciting in doggie
vision in the shape is smooth and
rounded making it difficult for even
most aggressive chewers to destroy from
the start Safety's been our number one
concern a lot of considerations been
built into the design and engineering of
tikar a special egg-like shape reduces
the impact of chewing on the toy and
increases the product's longevity we've
also chosen an fda-approved rubber blend
that's food safe for humans and dogs and
extremely durable over the last six
months we've been doing a ton of testing
using various rounds of prototypes we
now feel confident we have the design
and engineering dialed in the product is
safe and durable and there's no doubt
dogs absolutely love it we've partnered
with an experienced manufacturer in our
next step is to start getting the molds
made so that we can go into full
production the tooling costs are
substantial and to keep the price low
enough for everyone to enjoy
we'd like to make a sizable initial
order from the factory so to get the
ball rolling we're asking you
start a community for your support we've
had a lot of fun getting ticker to this
stage and our dogs had a blast they love
and we're excited to go into production
so that everyone else can join in we
hope you'll join us
