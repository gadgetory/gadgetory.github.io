create high-quality pictures and videos
dim lighting can make this a challenge
with dim lights it's possible to take
decent photos but with videos the

without proper lighting your videos will
come out grainy blurry and underexposed
that's why you need the fire path from

illumination tool that will help you
capture high-quality pictures and videos

advanced smartphone illumination tool on
the market offering a perfect beam of
light that fully fills up your camera's

lights these aren't powerful enough to
capture truly amazing content the fire

the light levels can be adjusted
manually with its slide switch or

technology it's a huge step forward in
flashlights and one of the most
convenient I've ever used
to me safety is everything especially at
night having a reliable light sidekick
is phenomenal because it's small size

wherever I go at all times so if the
power goes out if I'm in a place that I
need just that little bit of extra light
that I don't ordinarily have I can just
pull this thing out to keep going for it
so I used to use the light on my
smartphone whenever I needed a
flashlight but the sidekick is just so
much more powerful it doesn't vary my
battery I can still actually use my
phone to make phone calls it's so much
more convenient to carry around this is
