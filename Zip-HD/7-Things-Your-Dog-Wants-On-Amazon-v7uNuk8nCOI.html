health is not thrust upon us it's
something we build every day
when it's about our health we don't
compromise
we refuse to settle for mediocrity and
best guesses
we inspired new tools so we could move
beyond the uncertainty
we learned how to set the right goals
how to work hard to get at the top
to let them know how we fare when we're
apart
to give them new insights and we're not
feeling well
so they can make smarter decisions about
our health and behavior
we set out to explore
to build something bigger than us
a world where we all know what health
looks like
because we owe it to our humans to get
them off the couch to keep hounding them
to stay active and healthy
so we can wake up every day of our lives
let go totally insane
with joy
