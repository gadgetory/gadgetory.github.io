the holster has been reduced which makes
it more comfortable than ever before we
have eliminated the four points of
retention that limited the flex on the
3.0 and now we have a single point of
customized retention the 4.0 still has
the same patented stainless spring steel
core as the 3.0 however the new design
has allowed us to shrink this down which
provides much greater flexibility

hand and never worry about screws again
