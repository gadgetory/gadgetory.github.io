making food with nice fresh ingredients
we think foodie need could be a kitchen
revolution similar to how microwaves did
it back in the 70s
Houdini ships with empty food capsules
meaning that you as the user actually
buy fresh ingredients you prepare the
fresh ingredients for foodini and
Houdini prints it out with Houdini you
can do sweet foods savory foods
we don't have the six hours a day that
people used to have 50 years ago to make
all our meals and snacks homemade
it was really going back to making
homemade fresh food with fresh
ingredients so natural machines is a
young company we have a lot of
enthusiastic passionate people on board
people passionate about technology
passionate about food and combining that
together
we wanted to add that to the design
element to make it stand out to make it
special but at the same point to make it
fit into your kitchen and the appliance
that you would be proud to have on your
kitchen at all times and show to other
people
and at the end of the day that's what
it's all about is helping people eat
healthier more nutritious meals using
fresh ingredients
when we started working on this project
there were a handful of food 3d printers
on the market
none of them focusing on confectionary
and all of them costing thousands of
dollars we wanted to change that to
revolutionize the food 3d printing
industry by developing a premium product
and selling it at a great price candy
was the result candy can print using any
semi-solid food stop simply fill up the
dispenser with the filling of your
choice select the design you require
from the supplied SD card and printed
you can design under computer or choose
one of the preset designs that as the
car comes loaded with our evolutionary
plug-and-play electric extruder allows
you to print with any semi-solid
foodstuff or you can order the extruder
alone and use it with your current
through the temple candy looks great on
your countertop and comes in a range of
exciting colors to match your taste
3d printing confectionary put the fun
back into cooking it's a great way to
spend time with family with candy you
know exactly what's going into your food
and you can make it look any way you
like candy is also ideal for
professional confectioner's looking at
speed and consistency to the production
of the
candies with candy you can even start
their own cake decorating business at
home while your customers by giving the
users creative in ways they have never
seen before whether it's writing on
cakes making cookies printing the spoke
chocolates for a loved one or even
making custom decorations candy headed
covered
