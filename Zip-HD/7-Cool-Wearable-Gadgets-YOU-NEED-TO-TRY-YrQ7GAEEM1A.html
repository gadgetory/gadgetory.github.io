when I met a French girl that's really
where the story starts I was on vacation
and I met this girl it was difficult for
us to communicate because she didn't
speak English very well
and even when we tried to find a
solution like using some translation app
to communicate it's horrible
look if you are speaking and our phones
are in a face like this forget it this
is the wall we're out of this real world
interaction put this in your ear just
right back in it
l'id√©e put this in your ear
Schmidt said oh no no hey I put in here
comes up yeah okay can you hear me
French people thought the whole thing
was a nobodies all day yes I can hear
you talk Spanish of course is fist but
this is awesome
but how you do it yeah it's translating
translating
this little wearable uses translation
technology to allow two people to speak
different languages but still clearly
understand each other simply put when
one person speaks the other hears it in
their language developing the pilot has
been an intensive process our team has
been working over two years andrew is
our original co-founder and overseas
prior development I'm an electrical
engineer and expert in manufacturing we
also have mechanical engineer software
engineer PhD in machine translation as
well as an industrial designer our wide
breadth of experts has allowed us to
develop a product from the ground up we
wanted to create something that hugs the
curves of the year without being
obtrusive something snug but fashionable
to wear in the process we just decided
to throw in an extra earpiece for
wireless streaming music that means the
full system includes two earpieces and
its accompanying app it's from the app
itself where all of the languages are
uploaded to the earpiece it's kind of an
end-all solution for the traveler or the
international professional that's what
we're doing here at Waverly labs it's
simply the most advanced communication
wearable
we put a lot of energy into our days
what if we could get some of that energy
back amp e is a wearable device that
captures the energy from your motions
around the day and turns it into power
for your phone your movement is your
power and that's about it that's that's
all there is to it
wait cut that's it yeah you you move and
you're plugging this is supposed to be a
three-minute video you're killing me
Tages Mike and I met during our
engineering PhDs at northwestern we all
had the same problem our phones would
die before the end of the day so many
people have this problem over the past
year and a half we've refined the
technology inside NP we've optimized the
power generation components to the point
where you can still produce significant
power while maintaining a small
form-factor
you don't need to be an athlete any
motion will charge it we knew we were on
to something when MP kept winning crowd
favorite prizes at business competitions
everyone kept asking if they could get
one people loved the idea of taking
control over their charging habits it
frees them from the wall and motivates
them to get moving an P is designed to
just fit into your life its shape
matches the curves of your body and it's
easy to slip into your pocket or pop
into your purse if you live in a city
you probably walk enough to extend your
phone's battery life by 3 hours if you
also go on a run or maybe go cycling you
can extend it by six hours the more you
move the more power you get or you can
use AM P to charge your wearable devices
or any other device the charges via USB
but you don't need to use the power
right away you can store it for however
long you want and use it when your
device is needed most now we know that
everyone's different and some people
move in some pretty creative ways so
we've designed an accessory kit that
lets you move just about any way you
want we can't wait to hear how you use
an v
if you want to know how much power
you're getting out you can check the
companion smartphone it it lets you
track the energy you've generated along
with the calories you burn with ampie
you're producing green energy
kids these days are always out and about
and we as parents need a reliable way to
make sure our kids are safe at all times
meet dokey watch the first-ever
SmartWatch and wearable phone for kids
that features GPS tracking and video
calling hey then don't dance class yeah
we're gonna take the metro mode okay
honey we'll be safe dokey watch makes it
easy for modern families to stay
connected you want to go through the
skipper okay tell me go my world not all
kids are ready for smartphones just yet
with dokey watch you can make calls to a
preset list of contacts on their family
lists hey mom
Tara honey just be home on time for
dinner dokey watch uses advanced GPS GSM
and Wi-Fi technology to help parents
conveniently and accurately track their
child's location we also made dokey
watch fun by creating dokie pet a
virtual pet that lives in your kids
SmartWatch which also acts as a fitness
tracker
hey Duke I'm at the skate park beautiful
in the pub dokie watch allows kids to
send voice messages panda mogees to
their friends enabling them to keep in
touch in a fun and playful way bluetooth
pairing gives kids the ability to add
their friends to their contact list and
parents will always be in the loop
emergency's big and small can pop up at
any time the SOS function allows kids to
send immediate alerts to their parents
triggering continuous GPS tracking of
their location and a live recording of
surrounding sounds dokie watch gives
parents the peace of mind they crave and
kids the freedom to be kids dokey big
solutions in one small device
we've been using our computers like this
for the past thirty years this doesn't
work great in every situation and our
computers don't look like this anymore
or this they look like this or even this
a keyboard and mouse don't make sense
anymore it's time to get your hands
dirty with jest
just lets you control your computer with
your hands for example Photoshop adjust
the contrast OOP little less
okay now the brightness yep perfect
save that let's take this a little
further add a logo bring it down lower
little to the right great if you have
two of them you can even type
we take the raw data from every
accelerometer gyroscope and magnetometer
and pass it through advanced motion
processing it sometimes your friends can
get annoying quick hand gesture takes
care of that
just connect your iOS or Android device
so you can connect it to almost anything
like your lights and your music
well is the world's first pain relief
wearable we designed it for the hundred
million Americans suffering from chronic
pain
that's more than cancer heart disease
and diabetes combined if you were
someone with chronic pain such as
painful diabetic neuropathy fibromyalgia
sciatica osteoarthritis among others you
know what an impact chronic pain could
have on your daily activities your mood
and your ability to get a good night's
sleep and our goal was to develop an
over-the-counter solution that was a
hundred percent drug free and could live
with you discreetly day and night so we
tapped into neuro metrics is advanced
neuro technology expertise which
originated in the laboratories of
Harvard Medical School and MIT and
optimize the device for consumer use we
worked with one of the world's leading
design firms I do to really make it
again comfortable and just fit into your
life we developed a revolutionary one
our percent drug-free fda-cleared slim
lightweight device that gives you pain
relief at the press of a button quell
tracks your therapy and sleep quality
with an easy-to-use smartphone app
chronic pain effects sleep which limits
activity which worsens pain it's a
vicious cycle but now you can break the
cycle experience relief stay active
sleep better with quell here's how it
works
quell stimulates the sensory nerves in
your upper calf those nerves carry
neural pulses to your brain these pulses
trigger a natural pain relief response
in your central nervous system that
blocks pain signals throughout your body
quell is designed to live with you
bringing all day and all night
relief and it's easy to use snap the
electrode in place strap the band to
your upper calf
and simply push the button to start
relief that's it
