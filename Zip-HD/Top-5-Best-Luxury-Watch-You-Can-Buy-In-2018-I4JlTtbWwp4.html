efficient and unique how would you
define a luxury watch usually we think
of high quality exclusive gray design
and of course expensive
but does it really have to be expensive
you see the main reason high quality
watches cost so much is because of the
distributors wholesalers in retail
stores that mark up the price of a
luxury watch by up to 1000 percent our
team at Phillip Olivetti set out to
change that by cutting out all the
middlemen we bring a line of luxury
watches directly to you at a fraction of
the retail price the previous
collections we introduced on Kickstarter

future of luxury but more on that in a

functionality of a SmartWatch but it

problems with SmartWatch battery life

what is time
the measurement
a fundamental structure of the universe
or just something we made up to keep
things in order
time is intriguing time decides the
boundaries of our lives
what does time mean to you
for us tile is beautiful
time is elegant time is the capturing of
moments
we are tired of oversized and flashy
watches we want to go back to the
fundamentals beautiful design together

succeeded

watches the Belle Ã©poque of watch
design
the watch is made of high-quality
stainless steel with Japanese high
precision movement and sapphire glass

leather strap in our search for the
perfect leather we have visited many
tanneries in the end we found a small
tannery in the north of Sweden producing
among the finest vegetable tanned
leathers in the world all our watches

inside the ancient architecture and
magic energy of the old city of Geneva
