everyday life now anyone that owns a 3d
printer can use it for endless purposes
but is that really so most of the
potential 3d printer users may have
problems with using the device creating
a 3d model or even with realizing
possibilities that 3d printing may bring
them but they wanted to change it they
accepted the challenge after two years
of designing building and testing the
scree we're team brought to life the
most user-friendly home 3d printer ever
made with high-quality materials Wi-Fi
connection USB port removable magnetic
bed touchscreen and a print area of over
100 78 inches cubed screen where 3d
printer is ready to serve every user if
something is still missing there are
people who couldn't use this printer
because they wouldn't know how to create
a 3d design
how could screaming make it possible for
anyone to print what they need the
answer is screen market an online
platform where everyone could find 3d
models ready to print with just one
click the scree wear team worked day and
night to build a marketplace with
hundreds of models just waiting to be
printed at homes all over the world with
the screen wear market and they're ready
to use printer screen wear is prepared
to bring accessible 3d printing to
everyone
we're proud to announce not one but two
new products of the Robo family the Robo
c2 and the Robo are two 3d printers each
one set to redefine the boundaries of 3d
printing we've really built the
industry's wish list 3d printers
everything from best-in-class print
sizes the ability to print in 20 plus
materials class-leading print speeds at
250 millimeters a second removable print
beds built in color touch screens as
well as built-in Wi-Fi with a smartphone
app for wireless printing all this and
plenty more so we really built these
printers from the inside out we wanted
to be structurally sound and robust so
you can print fast you can print big and
you could print with any type of
material out there and we're building
this new line of machines our intention
was really to put all the technology and
devices that we see in smart electronics
into this new line of machine what
inspires me about the technology that we
work with is how easy it can be to use
so we designed the c2 in the AR to be a
full out-of-the-box experience pull the
printer out a quick five minutes set up
and you are ready to print we've entered
the age of personal manufacturing but
when it comes to making durable things
in your own shop there's still no easy
way to cut hard materials as makers and
engineers we need to work with all
materials so we've built a machine that
could the first desktop waterjet
where's our works by combining abrasive
particles with the high-pressure water
stream the mixture exits the nozzle and
cuts through the workpiece it's great
for any workshop it cuts every material
it's compact and contains and it's
digital so you can make precise cuts
that are impossible to make any other
way as an industrial designer I've used
a variety of desktop fabrication tools
but they tend to be very limited by the
durability of the materials you can use
on those machines but it's desktop water
jet we can go from design to component
to fitting that component and testing
within a couple of hours that's an
incredibly powerful tool as a jeweler
and an artist with the work I make I
spend a lot of time hand cutting so
right now I'm selling pieces sort of as
almost limited edition because I can't
physically output them not because I
want to be making in a limited edition
waser would allow me to not only make a
lot more but also to lower the price
point so they'd be available to a
broader audience I think you know people
tend to have their ideas constrained by
their tools and the things they're
capable of working with and having a
water jet cutter which has the ability
to cut I broader range of materials hard
materials like steel and glass will be
enabling and make them think in
different ways and have them build
different things they couldn't build
before the future of manufacturing is in
custom local fabrication people will be
able to make things in our own workshop
that they can use every single day and
will last a lifetime
meet helix it's more than just another
3d printer it's a precision additive
fabricator designed and built for the
professional
hilux 3d we think your equipment should
never limit your creativity
our years of experience with
consumer-level printers taught us there
had to be a better way that's why we
created helix it's a no compromises
machine helix constructed from
high-quality components and has a large
enclosed 30 litre build volume we chose
fused filament technology because of its
combination of convenience versatility
and speed what really sets helix apart
is what we call P aft that's precision
additive fabrication technology
it increases mechanical precision which
enables better calibration and you can
see the difference in the printed parts
path starts with our lead screw actuated
gantry
it's complemented by our convenient try
point bed leveling and incredibly
powerful exact retract extruders there's
no better extruder out there it takes 3d
printing to new heights
meet renegade the first 3d pen in the
world that allows you to reuse your
plastic bottles bags and files and turn
them into 3d art renegade is highly
reliable and breaks material limitations
thanks to its robust design powerful
motor and adjustable temperature all
other options available in today's
market use proprietary filaments which
don't contribute to reducing waste and
cost you 10 to 15 dollars per pack but
should 3d drawing and sculpting really
be such an expensive thing to do
renegade replaces a standard pack using
just two plastic bottles it will provide
you with perfectly stable 3d printing
you can significantly reduce the amount
of plastic waste your household produces
and you won't ever have to buy expensive
filaments again unlike other pens on the
market we're providing you with a nifty
accessory so you can create your own
strips at no extra cost this is the
trooper cut renegade secret weapon as
you can see in just a matter of seconds
it transforms plastic bottles into
plastic strips ready for your use
Chewbacca is really easy to use we'll
walk you through it in just a few
seconds start by warming up the bottle
we're using a heat gun but you can use
your hairdryer or stove then cut off the
bottom you can use scissors or any blade
if your bottle is large like ours you
can extend the telescopic holder which
keeps things stable then simply hold on
to the trooper cut and start pulling
it's that easy
chupa cut can produce strips three six
nine and 12 millimeters wide
with our optional stand you can store
and house plastic strips for future use
we also provide an attachment which
holds the strip's you're using in place
that's it you're now ready to start
creating 3d drawings sculptures and so
much more sometimes it's easy to forget
just how big the problem of plastic
waste is you can help by making sure
that all of your plastic bottles files
and even plastic bags have more than one
life together with wrenegade you can
become part of the solution to one of
the greatest environmental issues we all
face today so yes it really is that
simple you save time money and you're
helping the environment
3d printing should be affordable and
accessible to everyone and this is just
the beginning please support our journey
and help us bring renegades unique take
on 3d drawing into the market back us
today
reducing the lining by lightening 3d
the next step in SLA printing
powered by a custom DLP light engine the
Lightning produces fantastically
detailed prints with feature sizes as
small as 62 microns we use a custom UV
LED tune to efficiently cure resin this
makes the Lightning smaller quieter and
with a much longer light source lifespan
the Lightning has a moving build
platform each layer can be exposed in
two positions doubling the print volume
while maintaining high resolution
lightening will be supplied with
creation work here models can be
prepared and sports added for printing
the lightning can print standalone
without being tethered to a laptop or PC
wireless connectivity makes monitoring
print progress simple and sending prints
easy
an innovative resin that allows for
quick separation of the print between
layers it's durable teflon film surface
won't pry out and tear during printing
compact efficient precise the lining
