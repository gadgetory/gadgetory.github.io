Glyph is a tool that unlocks the full
potential of your smartphone as a camera
after numerous iterations and customer
feedback over the last six years we feel
we have designed the best version yet to
do that we focused on three areas number
one an innovative quick-release
mechanism grant tripod mounts in the
market today fall into two categories
the slow and cumbersome yet secure screw
style or the quick but unsecure spring
style we wanted to create a mount that
is the best of both the quick release
lever when open allows the jaws to move
freely making it easy to quickly load or
remove any device with or without a case
here's the clever bit when you close the
lever it automatically tightens and
locks around your device resulting in a
super secure connection number two the
ability to mount in portrait or
landscape the glyph has a side mount to
tripod thread which allows devices to be
mounted directly in portrait orientation
this is useful for panoramic photos
periscope snapchat or whatever the kids
are using these days
number three extensibility we want you
to consider the glyph the starting point
of your mobile photography rig as such
the glyph has a total of three mouths
these allow you to add additional
components like a microphone or elect
and speaking of additional components
along with the glyph we are launching a
couple of our own a hand grip and a
wrist strap not every situation calls
for mounting on a stationary tripod the
hand grip and wrist strap provide a
comfortable and secure handheld setup
even just combining the wrist strap with
the glyph is a handy way to add a bit of
comfort and security when shooting with
your smartphone the hand grip is made
from solid cherry wood and the wrist
strap is made of durable paracord and
leather everything is tough robust and
built to last
measuring tapes help us measure
distances and the dimensions of
different objects but a measuring tape
doesn't work in every situation
why isn't there a single tool that lets
us measure everything now there is
introducing bagel the smart tape measure
bagel lets you measure just about
anything at home and at work
bagel has three different modes spring
mode wheel mode and remote mode streng
mode is great for measuring straight
lines curves and around corners wheel
mode lets you measure irregular or odd
shaped objects and it also makes taking
measurements with one hand much easier
remote mode lets you measure objects
that are far away and out of your reach
after you're done measuring you'll need
a way to record your measurements using
pen and paper can be a real hassle with
bagel you can quickly and easily save
your measurements with voice
descriptions just take your measurement
push the Save button and then tag a
voice memo to it dog the future ADA when
you're done bangle will send your
measurements to bagels mobile app via
bluetooth this mobile application lets
you review your saved measurements and
share them with your friends bagel is
precise it uses our patented technology
to make sure you always get an accurate
measurement also bagel has an easy to
read digital display that's viewable in

gadgets we all love our gadgets
we're inseparable from them they're part
of everything we do there's one big
problem they constantly need to be
charged every single day this can really
hold you back when you're on the go
current solutions like battery banks far
from convenient and battery cases for
smartphones are bulky heavy and you
still have to plug everything in I mean
that's pretty old-school like using
Ethernet to get on the Internet
can you imagine life now without Wi-Fi
it's time to break free from wired
charging introducing the world's
smartest wireless charging ecosystem by
balance we have designed jackets pants
shorts wristlets wallets the charge your
devices wirelessly when you're wearing
our pants and shorts just slip your
phone in one pocket and your wallet in
the other voila now your phone is
charging wirelessly inside your pocket
and our jackets work the same way
wallet in one pocket bone in the other
and the best part is that you can use
your phone while it's charging here's
how it works we've designed the world's
thinnest wireless charging pads and
place them into the phone pockets of our
clothing and we've designed ultra slim
battery bank that fits into our wallets
or works as standalone and they send
power up the charging pads when you
place the phone in close contact the pad
transmits energy the phone receives it
and it starts charging wireless charging
pads are smaller than a credit card and
so light you'll barely even feel them
and guess what they're machine washable
they're designed to work with any Qi
compatible smartphone and with our ultra
slim cases for iPhones

places but now the perfect microscope

astonishing how this small microscope
can enlarge the target by up to 400
times its original size nurugo

education but it can also be utilized in
fields that require a microscope such as
