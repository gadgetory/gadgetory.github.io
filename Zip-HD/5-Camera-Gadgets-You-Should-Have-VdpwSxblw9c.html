great video has always needed great
audio now you can get both at a price
that works for everyone
introducing the microg the migrate is a
professional video handle with a
built-in broadcast quality stereo
microphone stabilizing grips are an
essential video tool necessary for
capturing low stable shots of
skateboarding snowboarding motocross and
other action
until now bulky and expensive
workarounds were required to get high
quality audio for these hard to capture
action jobs the migrate changes all this
just not your camera GoPro or smartphone
plug it into the handle and you're ready
to go the microwave includes adapters
and cables to work with nearly any
recording device from DSLRs camcorders
and mirrorless cameras to smartphones in
GoPros the mic rig features a resilient
lightweight ABS housing cushioned MBR
padded grip a rigorously point tested
structural design and two integrated
nine point seven millimeter condenser
mics no need for an expensive separate
external microphone the my crib captures
all your audio in high fidelity but the
most revolutionary part of the mic rig
is the price this unique product is only
available through Kickstarter at a
special price for early backers
this limited time offer puts you
lightyears ahead of anything else on the
market and takes your video production
to a brand new level whether you're
covering action shots run-and-gun filmer
shoes or professional events the
microwave has you covered
you
I'm CJ Bruner and I'm one of the
founders of pre-cal we have created a
wireless live-streaming system available
for all creators I also want a
production company called anthem film
and I've worked in nearly every role in
film production wireless video and live
streaming is a tool also makers can use
to benefit their production my name is
Clayton waha I'm a co-founder of free
cat I've also been skateboarding my
entire life and I co-founded the record
label output I'm always looking for
opportunities to help take content
creation to the next level being a
filmmaker you have a lot of moments
where you realize how lucky you are
I've traveled the world and I've worked
with amazing artists like Selena Gomez
Lindsey Stirling and 8 mavs rock a few
years ago we started asking is there a
better way to share this experience what
if we could live stream from any camera
how would that change film production we
decided to create an affordable solution
that could change content creation
forever
during our beta test phase pre cast has
already changed the way we think about
wireless video and live streaming we
have three free cast models standard pro
and universal standard and pro kits work
with gopro cameras and our universal kit
works with any camera with hdmi out you
can also live stream from any DSLR hdmi
camera to your social network the
pre-cast app lets you watch live record
footage in live stream in real time you
can do your footage on any iOS device as
well as any monitor with hdmi in you can
also be your footage up to five hundred
meters away from your camera we've been
using free casts and three basic ways to
cast your iOS device to cast the
production monitors and of course to
cast your social network
it's lightweight and we designed to
deliver professional quality video at a
price that even the smallest budget
productions kanna for we are ready to
manufacture and we want your help
reading precast alive
we're alpine labs and we make products
that allow photographers to see the
world differently and to capture it's
not captivating moments with the help of
people like you we started building our
ideas here on Kickstarter and five years
later we're excited to introduce SPARC
our most versatile camera remote yet
one device built for hundreds of
different camera clark is designed to go
where you go and has three distinct
trails wireless infrared traditional
wired triggering an app control unit the
red beam sent to your camera's built-in
sensor allows for ultra quick setup and
complete wireless triggering so you can
get out from behind the camera and be in
your own photos by plugging spark into
your camera's trigger port you can also
use it like a normal wired trigger and
if you want to quickly set up a time
lapse hold the spark button down count
the number of links and you're good to
go for a higher level of control use the
smartphone app it gives you access to
the complete set of smart features
including HDR time long exposures in
bulb ramping timeline you can leave in
control to three cameras at once for
synchronized triggering and with
Bluetooth for technology spark connect
immediately so you can get right to
shoot
we've launched four products on
Kickstarter and last year we really hope
to give photographers complete control
of their camera after delivering to over
12,000 backers we went back to the
drawing board to explore how we could
use the power of app control with the
ease and speed of infrared trigger we
wanted something with extremely long
battery life yet nimble enough that we
could always have it with us so we
created spark a device that it's super
fast when you need it it also has the
power to take long exposures time lapses
and shoot with more advanced techniques
we are captured beyond limits we are a
photo and video equipment company
specializing in lightweight and portable
equipment for outdoor photographers and
filmmakers I'm Chris maybe a mechanical
engineer and professional photographer
I'm kapowee an electrical engineer
normally when you're going out into the
field with all your photography
equipment you're already going to have a
tripod strapped to the outside of your
bag with a conventional slider adding a
2 or a 4 foot section of lighter is
going to be make it unbalanced or
cumbersome or difficult to maneuver so
we saw that there was a real need to
create a lightweight slider that you
could break down into smaller sections
and fit inside of your bag
as engineers and also photographers rail
design this product to cater to
photographers made
we created the Nebo slider the most
lightweight slider in the world it
weighs less than my camera and lens I
have here and it is incredibly easy to
take into the field this 40 inch slider
can break down and carry on the retal
rafi backpack or even a normal regular
bag
the idea for the Niebla slider was born
a while on assignment in the national
parks
we're on a two-day assignment to visit
three parks to capture the government
shutdown of 2013 we wish that we could
have taken a slider to capture time
lapses but the current equipment we had
was too big and took too long to set up
and so if we had a lightweight compact
maybe the takedown option like the Nemo
slider we could have gone a lot more
content this is the last year designing
and prototyping slider there was solved
problems the motorized version weighs in
at 3.2 pounds it has adjustable speed
and runs off a 9-volt battery so you can
get the battery no matter where you go
and for filmmakers that feel like they
don't need a time lapse motor we have a
non motorized version that weighs in at
just 2.2 pounds we've partnered with
quickly camera bags and Visal tripods to
offer you packages with the knee goes
lighter the kneeble slider is made of
anodized aircraft grade aluminum and
carbon fiber to make it lightweight and
stable the slider comes with a center
melt and only two side mount so for a
lightweight setup you can use one tripod
and for more stability you can use to
track on a wide-angle lens is a basic
but very important part for every
photographers bag there are a lots of
wide-angle lenses in the market but most
of them are suffering to get a traumatic
barrel distortion or corner sharpness or
a too bulky to carry
over the last two years Venus optics
have launched a number of lenses to meet
unique needs
ographers today we are launching the
laowai 12 millimeter X 0.8 an incredible
ultra wide-angle lens with close to zero
Distortion we have spent a lot of time
to design and develop a rectilinear lens
which can overcome the weaknesses of
existing wide-angle lenses on the market
we also need a lens to be fast and wide
enough for all types of photography from
landscape architecture interior to
travel and astrophotography
the low wire 12 millimeter at 2.8 gives
you an extreme 122 degrees angle of view
allowing you to compose an impressive
landscape photo with ease it also allows
you to capture the beauty of
architecture with close to zero
distortion even if you're refusing a
small house it will still look spacious
and impactful in your photos
keeping barrel distortion out some
images from ultra wide-angle lens to
challenging the ultra wines in the
market tend to suffer from two to five
percent distortion the wider the lens
the higher chance of distortion
our design team took on the challenge
who came up with an optical design which
can successfully minimize the
distortions in extremely low levels
you'll struggle to see any straight
lines which have been distorted and what
about the size Keebler amazed at how
small and light our low wire language
when compared to other ultralights and
fast lenses on the market you can insert
a hundred millimeter neutral density
filters and a 105 millimeter circular
polarizer into our optional filter
holder to create the best landscape
photo ever it weighs just 610 grams and
has a front diameter of 77 millimeters
our low wire land is currently the
fastest 12 millimeter lens in the market
of full-frame cameras the large aperture
is perfect for astrophotography wear a
shorter exposure time is really critical
for that perfect Milkyway shot and of
course it is also extremely convenient
for shooting action in limited light or
in an indoor environment in order to be
the fast ultra wide-angle lens an
outstanding optical performance cannot
be compromised house with 16 lens
elements including three extra low
dispersion elements and two espírito
lens elements are a low wirel and v
excellent sharpness and contrast from
corner to corner chromatic aberration is
also extremely well controlled now our
top millimeters F 2.8 is the best ultra
wide-angle lens that everyone has been
trained for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
