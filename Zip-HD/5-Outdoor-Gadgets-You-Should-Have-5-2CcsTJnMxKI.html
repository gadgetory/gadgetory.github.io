that food with me all the time we've
made a reusable container that you can
take everywhere with you it's super
convenient it's wonderful to have and
it's worth its weight when you carry it
around the majority of trash that I
create is from food waste wax cardboard
styrofoam plastic things that get thrown
away it's all packaging I want to do
everything I can to prevent the natural
world from being stuffed with trash what
does it mean to live in a world where
we're conscious about the way we create
waste there are ways to reduce it we
developed a product that doesn't break
easily is dishwasher safe and food safe

foundations for food and it can clip
easily to your backpack that makes it
highly portable it holds 33 ounces
that's a big enough meal for any size

around for a container that won't leak
and none of them fit that bill they
always have some amount of liquid coming
out of them the green traveler allows
you to carry delicious healthy food with
you impact any food you want or non-food
items it won't leak it will keep water
out and you have four compartments to
choose from you get to experience
