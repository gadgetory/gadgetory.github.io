fiction is very quickly becoming
possible if you point the structure
sensor out into the world you're
capturing the world it's like giving
some sort of a superpower to average
Jodha budget what if you could give your
mobile device a new sense the ability to
not just capture the world in
two-dimensional images but to actually
understand it in three dimensions the
structure sensor does just that it's the
world's first 3d sensor for mobile
devices what I really am excited about
the destructor sensor is it makes it so
easy you can clip it to a mobile device
and walk around your world basically
pull your world into a digital form my
name is Jeff powers and I'm a founder of
occipital we're passionate about giving
devices the ability to see and
understand the world around them this
isn't about taking pictures it's about
computer vision and interaction we call
it spatial computing it's much bigger
than just us and it's going to change
the way we interact with the world let
me show you what you can do with that
you'll be able to capture every
dimension of an entire room in a matter
of seconds and you can send a model to
your phone so you can get any dimension
you need at any time you'll be able to
easily capture and send
three-dimensional objects across town or
across the world and make decisions
together
even when you're apart you'll be able to
play games games where the real world
becomes the game world building hardware
is something we have never done
occipital is fundamentally a software
company so to create this device we had
to teach ourselves Hardware design and
we were lucky enough to work with some
of the best technology companies in the
world not the least of which is
primeSense the company whose technology
actually powered the original Kinect
applying 3d technology to mobile devices
is an immense challenge our secret is
geared to make that the panel 360 and
read lays there so this is a team that
can actually pull this off structure
works by capturing a pattern of
invisible laser projected light which
allows you to measure thousands of
distances all at once the iPad has
arguably the best user experience of any
tab
and it was important to us to go the
extra mile to make structure work
specifically with it
structure latches securely to your iPad
it connects via the new lightning
connector the end result is actually
thermal design mechanical design
industrial design open put together into
one perfect object structures single
piece body is machined from high-grade
anodized aluminum it serves as both a
beautiful exterior and as a thermal core
that keeps the precision optics inside
at an optimal temperature what's really
important is get a platform out there
and see what developers do with it for
the first time you'll get an SDK that
lets you tap into a 3d sensor on iOS
you'll have complete low-level access to
the sensor and if you don't feel like
processing raw depth data you can tap
into the high level API just write your
application in Xcode and hit deploy you
can even launch your app on the App
Store if you want to develop on another
platform we're giving you everything you
need a USB hacker cable open source
drivers and even open CAD specs so you
can 3d print your own attachment for
almost anything so this started about a
year ago where we have to measure the
contours of an organic surface turns out
that's a very hard problem the only
available solution cost twenty thousand
dollars and that that's ridiculous so we
started to build our own we looked at
what was available out there at the
intersection of computer vision and
surface measurement and we couldn't find
a single solution that was compelling
the 3d scanners ever precise cost tens
of thousands of dollars and the ones
that were affordable one processor today
that changes
we're only just beginning to explore the
possibilities of capturing the world in
3d 3d printing is an amazing tool it
converts a digital file into a physical
object some call it an industrial
revolution the eora 3d scanner does the
exact opposite of the 3d printer it lets
artists makers and designers captured
objects and surfaces and turn them into
high-quality 3d models and use them as
part of the creative process we knew we
had to use a smart phone smaller phones
are simply amazing
we use them to take pictures edit videos
update social media even for gaming the
eora 3d scanner is powered entirely by
your smartphone using it as easy just
open the app and press scan it'll
automatically adjust focus and exposure
and drive a green laser to scan your
object as it sweeps we take over 1,000
photos and analyze them in real time to
give you a 3d model a typical scan takes
three to five minutes and gives you a
full-color mesh with up to eight million
points with a range of one meter you can
capture objects big as one accurate to
less than 100 microns that's the
thickness of a single sheet of paper
when engineering the scanner we had one
objective in mind
precision all that's possible thanks to
a design that's both beautiful and
machined from a solid block of aluminium
with over 35 milling operations we've
designed it to be both robust and
precise the light ring gives you quick
visual feedback and the adjustable knob
lets just secure any model smartphone
the green laser let's just scan in any
lighting conditions as most cameras are
twice as sensitive to green than any
other color for water type models we
also design a Bluetooth turntable it
will sync to your scanner and rotate
your object to make sure you get every
angle your bat digitizer quickly turns
the things in your world into 3d models
that you can modify improve share and 3d
print today we're gonna take a look at
how it works and do a quick run-through
the first thing is to find a nice sturdy
spot for your digitizer pay special
attention to lighting and make sure that
there are no bright lights in the
cameras field of view and avoid sunlight
in Windows as much as possible once
you've found a sturdy spot for your
digitizer and it's all plugged in and
ready to go you can download the maker
way for digitizer software from our
website MakerBot comm the first time you
open maker way for digitizer software
you'll be prompted with the welcome
screen this will guide you through a
simple three step calibration process to
ensure that your scanner is ready to go
let's take a look at how that works
the first step is to ensure that your
filter is over your camera lens if it's
not slide it over and ensure it clicks
into place
the next step is camera calibration to
perform it take your calibration tool
ensure that the a is pointing upward and
fit the peg on the bottom into the
center hole in the turntable click in
the software to continue after camera
calibration you then need to perform
turntable calibration your calibration
tool should be flipped over so that the
B is pointing upward and again the peg
on the bottom fits into the center hole
in your turntable and click in the
software to continue
finally you need to calibrate your
lasers remove the insert from the
calibration tool make sure the C is
pointing upward and place it in the
center of the turntable as shown click
in the software to continue now you're
all calibrated and ready to scan once
you've calibrated and you've selected an
object you want to scan go ahead and
place it in the center of the turntable
Center is usually best but it's not
always the case feel free to experiment
with object positioning in the software
you'll see the new scan screen you'll
notice the camera feed is very dark this
is good this tells you that there are no
lights flooding your camera now select
the shade of your object there are three
settings light medium and dark select
the one that best suits your object then
click start scan to get the whole
process moving you'll notice your first
laser will turn on and your object will
begin to rotate the laser light is
reflecting off the object into the
camera sensor and the software is
processing it into a 3d point cloud all
on screen after the first rotation
completes the lasers will switch and it
will do another full rotation you will
then have to point clouds that will then
be merged and meshed together into a 3d
printable water-type mesh once your scan
is complete you can choose to share it
on Thingiverse which will prompt you to
take a photo or you can share it with
your other social networks you can also
save a copy as an STL directly onto your
hard drive or hit the print with
makerware button which will open it into
a maker or window where you can export
it to a 3d printable file and bring it
right over to your MakerBot replicator 2
and get it printing on the right you'll
see the original MakerBot gnome and on
the left you'll see the digitized and
printed note you'll notice a slight loss
in detail but the MakerBot digitizer
still makes an excellent replica of your
original model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
