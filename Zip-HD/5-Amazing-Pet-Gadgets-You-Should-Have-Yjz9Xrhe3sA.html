buds when we leave for the day
that's where Peggy comes in so you can
keep the fun going and going use the app
to drive it remote to interact with your
pet even when you're not there with a
frame made from durable polycarbonate
heavy can built anywhere slobber no
problem not even a scratch using the
motion sensor collar having is able to
track your dog's activity and give you
vital information about her mobility and
health in the palm of your hand and when
you're done playing just place a penny
and it's wireless charging baby that
plugs itself in heavy was designed to be
a powerful customizable tool for pet
owners on the go who still want to be
actively engaged with their pets and
stay on top of their pets health penny
comes equipped with a wide-angle camera
to capture every moment and glorious
stabilized HD easily share footage on
social media and keep your pet guessing
with built-in lasers that pets will love
say hello to the litter robot an
automatic self-cleaning litter box
it really works its unique design senses
when your cat is inside and when it's
time to clean up
once your cat exits a cleaning cycle
will begin automatically the patented
sifting process separates the clumps
from the clean litter and deposits them
into a carbon filter drawer below
reducing those unpleasant odors and
leaving a clean bed of litter every time
Oh empty the waste drawer when indicated
and as litter is needed it's that simple
the litter robot is great for multiple
cats large cats and cats as small as
five pounds there's even an automatic
nightlight for elderly cats no special
accessories required just plug it in add
clumping litter and let the litter robot
do the rest so say hello to the last
litter box you will ever buy and say
goodbye to scooping litter forever
dogs are part of our lives and Families
we love to spend time together and take
good care of them well there are a few
hassles though like regular grooming and
cleaning up pet hair as designers and
dog lovers we invented broom house a
unique pet hair solution for easy and
clean dog grooming at home groom pal is
super easy to use regardless of your pet
breed or grooming experience unlike
other clippers or vacuum devices
Brewed pal is powered by a revolutionary
air touch technology solely driven by
the wind rather than a regular motor the
groom pal clipper is lighter more
flexible and safer than other products
on the market
it can be used on all the sensitive
parts with no risk of hurting your furry
friends trim your dog from any angle
adjust to different lengths and always
get an even cut
no hair left behind thanks to the strong
vacuum power broom pal is an all-in-one
solution it comes with three attachments
besides the trim the brush attachment
helps reduce shedding and keeps your
dog's hair and skin healthy the crevice
tool helps to clean hard-to-reach
corners it eliminates all mess
with a unique dust compressor and a
large container the maintenance becomes
easy catastrophic creation started as a
hobby in Portland Oregon after bringing
our two kittens home we had trouble
finding quality fun and functional cat
furniture that enhance the look of our
home our solution was gutting our own
furniture for them using stained wood
and canvas fabric after seeing how much
our cats loved it we decided to make it
available to cat owners worldwide by
selling it on Etsy the furniture has
been a huge hit with pet owners and our
business has grown tremendously in the
past two and a half years receiving
international attention some of our most
popular items come from our collection
of wall-mounted fabric cat complexes
we've received a lot of positive
feedback about these complexes but we
have also been listening closely to our
customers about what could be improved
we've been hard at work for over a year
trying to figure out how to solve these
issues and the result is our new modular
cat wall system these complexes evoke
feeling instinct allowing cats to climb
up high on the wall giving them the
vertical space they crave
the tall sisal lined polls give cats a
positive outlet for the natural instinct
to scratch the furniture can also help
the territorial issues and homes with
multiple cats as well as giving them a
haven away from children and dogs with
our patent-pending design we have
completely re-engineered the product our
new brackets hide all mounting hardware
from veal adding a sleek look to our
complexes are 100% cotton canvas fabric
can now be easily removable washing all
our complexes are mounted to the wooden
studs lifts that be hang drywall the
standard spacing is 16 inches on Center
in US homes the next coming distance
being 24 inches we have placed grommets
down the fabric and eight inch
increments so that these complexes will
work for almost any sub segment with
this new system people can build
complexes for their cats based on our
templates or they can get creative and
design custom feeling fortresses
themselves with limitless options it
works great for people with limited
space to devote to their cats and also
for people who want to build gigantic
cat walls our modular system allows for
starting small and then adding on in the
future with our interchangeable
accessories cat lovers can easily add
items like food dishes and sisal tools
to their complexes
