printing fun and accessible for everyone
and to make products that are a launch
pad for your imagination turning any one
of your bright ideas into a physical
reality with its versatile full feature
set the Robo c2 Compaq smart 3d printer
with Wi-Fi gives makers of all skill
levels and backgrounds the freedom to
create high quality 3d prints for a wide
range of personal and professional
projects the Robo are two
high-performance smart 3d printer with
Wi-Fi is larger in size with a more
robust feature set that gives serious
results driven makers the ability to
tackle large-scale 3d prints for a wide
range of professional-grade projects
powering your 3d printing experience
with Robo situ and Robo our tube is the
Robo app which gives you control
precision right from your mobile device
plus it offers an array of more
impressive functionality whether you're
printing at home in the workplace or in
the classroom rest assured we're ready
to bring your ideas to life because when
you have the tool that makes it all
happen there is no limit to what you can
make next
you
what if creating objects
easy is imagine them complicated set of
procedures and software cannot to hinder
creativity making it difficult to
achieve the results you desire so we
simplify this process by creating reduce
the world's first fully integrated
all-in-one 3d printer scanner this
beautifully streamlined design and
intuitive interface Zeus is the perfect
vehicle of expression for imagination of
all ages Zeus the only standalone plug
is a device of a design of the market
quickly and easily upload the design
uses Wi-Fi connection or USB user model
should any angle and edit them on board
with this week 7 inch touchscreen
display like any closet printer let's
use data from their weather generator
from a 3d scanned or CAD designs
produces equipped with talisman software
to slice any 3d model for printed the
juice saves you time and space by
removing the need for an external
computer and third-party software
hosting a powerful unfortunate and
unparalleled inequality this is the
ultimate powerhouses in creation as car
reality uses birth in class recording
feature also makes it leading in
communities with their engineers
directly if any problems arise our team
is working all hours of the day to
ensure that we provide users it has cost
or customer support experience so you
will never be alone we saw that in more
and more industries from architecture
design industry medicine food industry
the adoption for 3d printer started and
we thought it's a good opportunity to
build the user-friendly 3d printer on
the market we believe with the suits we
created a platform that's very very
accessible for the majority of people
out there in the market whether it's
going to be prosumers or consumers to
start with 3d printing or to use our
students as an advanced 3d printer for
their professional work wherever your
mind wants to go Jews will take you
there and however you want to create the
deuce is your tool to make your
imagination a reality
hello from new matter we're helping you
make great things by creating a simple
and affordable end-to-end 3d printing
experience here's how the new matter
ecosystem works our 3d printer the mod
G's been developed to work seamlessly
with the new matter store or online
marketplace for 3d design if you
purchase your mod T just log on to the
new matter store and browse our curated
catalogue a printable design find a free
design purchase 1 or print your own STL
or obj file you can preview your designs
using our integrated 3d viewer in the
store then click print and your design
will be sent directly to the mod T via
its built-in Wi-Fi connection push the
button on the mod T and that's it once
it's finished you can enjoy your new 3d
printed design and also share it with
the new matter community so check out
the mod T and new matter store today
making great things has never been
easier visit new matter comm to learn

innovation begins with a single idea at
every step of ideation MakerBot has the
3d printing solutions that help guide
you and give you focus this is the power
of process and iteration the
collaborative space that allows you to
imagine create and grow powerful new
features streamline 3d print
preparations allowing better processes
and ultimately better results this is
the freedom of experimentation you can
move to the next idea constantly
creating modifying and making MakerBot
is more than a 3d printer and our 3d
printers offer more than you expected
with connected accounts you can store
files in the cloud or even connect to
and control multiple printers on
multiple networks to accelerate the
design process and streamline your
workflow with solutions built to rapid
iteration and proven returns less
debating and more trying it out less
doubt and more conviction less planning
more process
MakerBot ideas in the making
I've been involved in the field of
personal fabrication for five years now
and I've seen what an amazing impact
that these tools can have but I've also
realized that these tools are just a
fraction of what's possible when we were
at the Media Lab at MIT we had access to
an amazing set of tools
3d printing being one of the most
important for designers and engineers
like us there was simply no solution if
you want a high-resolution 3d printer at
low cost on your death so we decided to
build it ourselves
I really cannot imagine where my
research would be without 3d printers I
would really like to have a 3d printer
like that we don't currently have any of
the existing low-cost machines because
the part quality resolution and
repeatability is nowhere where we need
it to be in architecture and many design
fields the software tools have advanced
pretty significantly but there's been a
gap between what you can actually design
and what you can actually make and I
think the formlabs printer provides an
exciting opportunity to be able to
design and then physically make quickly
precise complex geometry formulas
changes the way people design things
they're going to be able to get really
pro polity 3d printed parts way cheaper
way faster than they've ever been able
to do that before form lab takes us a
giant step closer to the engineer's
dream which is routine 3d printing the
way they'd print on paper to design the
3d printer that produces great parts
every time we've got to bring together a
team of designers engineers and material
scientists to make a tightly integrated
product if you can do that you can
fundamentally change 3d printing and I
think we've done exactly that
Sarah's barfi is great the tried and
true progress been around for well over
25 years produces the best quality parts
in the industry the way it works is
pretty simple a laser beam is drawn
across the surface of the liquid plastic
resin that hardens when exposed to a
specific wavelength of light after the
layers drawn the build platform lifts
and the process is repeated layer by
layer until the part is finished
we have a great user experience we have
powerful easy-to-use software we've
built a reliable and beautifully
designed printer and we're developing
materials which will enable our users to
make amazing things
we've been working on the design of our
product for over a year and it's nearly
complete and so now it's time to start
gearing up manufacturing so that we can
get it into the hands of users
everywhere but to do that require
substantial resources the bottom line
designers are going to be able to make a
lot more 3d printed parts and I don't
mean a few designers I mean a few
hundred thousand designers a million
designers are going to have access to 3d
printing in a way they didn't before
format imagine you have an incredible
concept and what we want to do is give
you a great tool to make it real</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
