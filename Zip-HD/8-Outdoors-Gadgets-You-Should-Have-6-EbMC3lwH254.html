today we are talking about the brand new
Jetboil flash now if you're familiar
with jeb boil chances are you've used a
flash before but now for 2018 it is the
fastest stove on the planet to boil
water
and the flash has always been about
lightning fast oil times and the new
model continues that by shaving an
entire minute off the previous versions
boil time of 2 minutes and 30 seconds
that means you can now boil 16 ounces of
water in just 100 seconds that means by
the time you're done watching this video
you could have made tea or had dinner
cooking measuring boil time in seconds
is a huge deal it means you'll be eating
sipping coffee or just have clean
drinking water faster than ever before
the engineers a jet boil were able to
cut down the time by a minute by
challenging every aspect of the stove
they model the combustion and selected
materials to completely optimize speed
efficiency and precision the base plate
on a new flash which you can see right
here is made of aluminum and that means
it's an ounce lighter than previous
models also makes for an easier on/off
connection than the older model the new
flash also has a thermo chromatic heat
indicator that changes color for safety
and fuel efficiency and it tells you
exactly when the water is hot so you
don't waste any fuel it still comes with
a 1 liter flux ring cooking cup and
insulated cozy but it's also been
updated with a more ergonomic design and
an improved lid for better fit and
function it's got a drink through lid
with a built in strainer and the bottom
cover doubles as a measuring cup and a
bowl flash also has a reliable push
button igniter so you don't have to
worry about forgetting your lighter and
it puts out 9,000 BTUs of power now
that's a lot of power but what's
important is what Jetboil does with all
that energy flux ring technology which
you can see right here means every vtu
goes into heating your meal and not the
air around it so due to that amazing
fuel efficiency the new flash will let
you boil 10 litres of water with just
one of these hundred gram jet power cans
there are also new flash Cosi color
options for 2018 including carbon black
matrix jet cam and wilderness and you
can opt for the new flash Java kit which
you can see right here I love this thing
because it gives you a flash cooking
system and a coffee press all-in-one and
you can never have enough good coffee in
the backcountry
new flash is also compatible with other
accessories like the hanging kit pot
support flux ring frying pan and pot and
utensils so the new flash is an amazing
improvement to a legendary cooking
system it weighs just 13.1 ounces and
with 100 second boil time it's the
fastest jet coil ever made so if you're
looking for the world's fastest and most
efficient backcountry cooking system you
just found it however you hydrate we've
got your back sometimes you need to
hydrate quickly so we built Camelback
shoot a leak proof durable bpa-free
bottle that provides rapid hydration on
any adventure every detail of shoot is
thoughtfully designed we engineered the
angle of the spout to provide an
ergonomic drink interface that delivers
a high flow of water without sloshing or
spilling the spout cap threads
internally so that you have a
comfortable drink interface no more
drinking off those uncomfortable threads
of a bottle when you need water twist
the cap a half turn and stow it away in
the handle the spout cap actually snaps
into place in the handle to prevent it
from flopping around when you drink we
even designed the handle to find a
comfortable carry size for a full eater
of water on those longer hikes or trucks
across campus lastly the tether securely
attaches the cap to the bottle for easy
filling and refilling to clean your
shoot bottle just remove the cap from
the bottle and place the spout cap
bottle cap and bottle in the dishwasher
