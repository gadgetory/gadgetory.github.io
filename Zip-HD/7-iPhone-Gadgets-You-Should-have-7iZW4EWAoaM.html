We are Lumenati
We are a group of filmmakers that make all sorts of different videos
we've used all the high end cameras and we absolutely love them but we couldn't stop
wondering what about the high quality camera in our pockets?  Why weren't we using this?
The body around that camera was designed for texting, talking on the phone and
playing angry birds, and you can't see what you are shooting in bright light, so we
decided to do something about it and pretty soon we have ourselves one of
these and we made sure to shoot this entire film using the Lumenati CS1.
Just slide your iPhone in like you are loading super 8 film, you've created one of the
most powerful and affordable cameras on the market.
A positive trigger system means you never missed a shot) hold and hold the film, release the
stop. With a high quality interchangeable video change lens system you can use lumenati lenses or
use your own. Add a microphone or light on the included   use
the sport attachment to shoot incredible images on the move.  The CS1 fits on any
tri-pod and with the real time digital view finder you can see the shot
in high ambient light, no more squinting ever again. Add film looks on the fly
, stick in some music and make a great edit right inside the Luminati App.
No matter where you decide to use CS1 the illuminate App makes sharing
instantaneous, press a button to upload and share your creation to Facebook

Our phones are the most important devices in our lives, they revolve around us and help us to capture the most intimate
moment and communicate with the world but they never seems to get us through the day and we
always find ourselves plugged into the wall, we are always on the go and need a wire
free solution that's completely mobile and highly versatile.  However nothing quite like it
exists that's why

wanted to create one which was extremely
thin and wire-free.
Zuk delivered a phone, 100% charge to your iPhone
allowing you to get through your entire day with full on the go battery charge.
We spent countless hours reformulating
and tweaking our product to make it
the best it could possibly be

scratches and has a built-in LED indicator on the back letting you know
exactly how much juice is left at any given time and when your battery pack
needs recharge of its own simply plug in and wireless set down

things that make the iphone the iphone, but what they have done is to create an intelligent
case that doesn't jeopardize the sleek and light weight body of the iphone.  They led us to create something
that they couldn't even imagine before - their own case.

simple way to make your phone more about you.  It's fun, stylish and very effective.
The accessories market is overpopulated with different types of cases, different sizes,
shapes, colours and materials, but what we have done is to design an intelligent
product that not only increases the functionality of your phone but most
importantly the use-ability.
It's great having a case that's frees you from the limits of your phone
now not only do you have a smart phone but a smart case.
It captures electro-magnetic waves from around the iphone and uses
it to power electrification at the back of the case.
The lume case brings the back of your phone to life.  The case lights up and identifies which message
type   been coming on your device before your phone even knows
We will get an additional way to see identification without compromising iphone confidentiality
it's not just a phone accessory for a smart phone, the case can work with you
and let you know what's going on in your e-life.
The coolest thing about our case is that with no batteries and no cords you take it straight
out of the box put it on your phone and you are ready to go.
The Bluetooth handset is a great thing;
it prevents tickets and accidents when
we're driving and it allows us to use

* How many of them have you lost? 
* How many new ones have you bought?
* How many times did you wish to add one only to realize it was dead or left in your car?
&quot;Hey man I am going have to put you on to the car speaker, I can't find my headset.&quot;
