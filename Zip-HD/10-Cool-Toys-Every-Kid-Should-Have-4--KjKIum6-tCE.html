this is Cosmo Cosmo Cosmo Cosmo is a
rambunctious little kid a little bit
mischievous he's smart a lot of robot in
a very small package all the technology
inside of Cosmo is really there for one
reason to bring the magic of robotic
character to life it's a very complex
system and has for transmissions inside
of it with probably 40 or 50 years each
robot is made out of over 300 different
parts there's the AI systems the
robotics accelerometers the animation
gyros the computer vision we're running
an extremely complicated artificial
intelligence inside the robot which
needs to make thousands and thousands of
decisions per second he's a mobile
manipulator he can drive around the
world he can see you he's recognized you
he looked up at me and his eyes went
whoa and I was like well he just
recognized me gives you goosebumps
because you realize that this is a
little character who actually
understands who you are and what role
you play in his world figuring out the
path to a unique personalities it's an
ongoing question I think we did about 40
50 studies on just little nuances
looking at the interface with the
monitor where the eyes are gonna look at
you
gospel moves the head and and follows
you every little detail have it's
special attention paid to it we
literally have a rigged up version of
Cosmo in Maya where our animators can
animate him using the exact same
techniques that they would use for
digital characters except the output
isn't rendered the output is actually
Cosmo behaving in the
we've been looking for ways to make it
either feel more organic more than
perfect so that it feels more than he
made it sound is a critical piece it's
the one dimension where we have full
control just like in a movie or a video
game we're building his procedural voice
system we're doing all these things so
that as you interact with Cosmo he
becomes his own thing one of the things
that makes Cosmo so surprising and so
lovable is that he defies your
expectations we're creating something
that really does feel like it's part of
the family those are the moments we
usually don't share with machines or
robots until now Cosmo is a pioneer for
the ability to create characters and
tell stories in the real world with this
technology we can make additional
characters with new capabilities new
personalities and a level that we've
never seen before I want you to have
this because when I was young it taught
me a valuable lesson about saving for
what I wanted I know it may look like
just a piggy bank but it's much more
than that it's linked to your own very
first savings and there's no limit what
you can put into it you set up your
goals and what you want to save for and
then tasks can be assigned to do around
the house this sure enough to get all
right now
that are worth money towards your like
take out the trash it'll teach you about
responsibility while making savings fun
ready
Hey
and instill a sense of accountability as
well you learn that setbacks won't get
in the way of getting to those goals if
you work hard show a good sense of
determination do everything else
primetime approach things with an
optimistic attitude those goals are
attained the lesson that's the most
important one thing to never forget tax
that's why I want you to have this you
might be a little too young but you'll
get there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
