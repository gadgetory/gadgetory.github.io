meet human a modular smart power system
easily snap together different power
modules to build a customized power
system suited to your specific judging
needs
hi I'm Tobias head designer of unit and
I'm Canadian one of the engineers our
small team is made up of friends we have
several years of experience developing
and manufacturing everyday products that
offer innovative design solutions so we
came up with a stylish modular multi
power solution that offers greater
functionality since 2014 we've been
developing and testing several
prototypes of you more and our designs
in your own unique journey start with a
base coat and snap on a multi power
module then customize your humour by
adding on more modules skip the cables
and simply charge wires
snap on extra USB ports to charge all
your horrible devices snap on the
wireless speaker module and listen to
music
youmu is also interchangeable with
international plus switch out the base
cord plug when traveling or simply snap
in your own you move to module in
another country make your life smarter
communicate with you more with our app
to better control and monitor your
devices
the emotive insight is a five channel
portable wearable device that allows you
to capture and understand what's going
on in your brain in real time with the
emotive insight you can optimize your
cognitive performance you can measure
and monitor your own or your family's
mental health and fitness and you can
develop amazing new applications with
the technology we're pioneers in this
field we've listened to our user base
and we redesign the product from the
ground up we're now reaching out to our
community to help make this a reality
the Emotiv EPOC our first generation
device has been adopted and used in more
than 100 countries worldwide across a
broad spectrum of different application
areas everything from being able to
allow a child to create a 3d monster
just with the fantasy of his or her mind
or allow people to create music just
with the power of their thoughts or to
allow a patient to be rehabilitated by
being able to control an electric
wheelchair or allow them to experience
the ability to type or to communicate
again there have been so many amazing
application areas and uses that have
been transformative and life-changing
for anyone who loves The Epoch you'll
love this product even more because we
feel like we've taken not just one
generation or leave but we've taken many
generational leaps we've looked at the
sensor technology we've looked at the
electronics design we've looked at the
wireless communication protocol we've
looked at the overall mechanical design
we've looked at the form factor how do
we make it more affordable how do we
make it much more scalable much lighter
weight much easier to wear we're really
excited to offer an AP
and SDK to developers and researchers
wanting access to the raw EEG data or to
the detection algorithms to make it
possible for anyone to take this
innovation and create amazing new
applications with the technology
hi I'm yonas creator of the panono
camera a camera that can do exactly
these things it captures everything in
every direction all at once and it has a
super-high resolution of 72 megapixels
it uses 36 tiny but powerful cameras
that fire all at once you just throw
them to the air and at the highest point
when it is barely moving it captures a
fully spherical panoramic image
automatically to view the images you
simply point the smartphone or tablet in
the direction of the sea and move it
around it's amazing that's absolutely
we built the original prototype two
years ago back then it was called
throwable panoramic ball camera you put
a video of it on YouTube that was viewed
nearly three and a half million times we
got a lot of great press coverage but
most importantly we got thousands of
emails from people wanting to buy the
camera at that time and in that form it
was too expensive for mass production so
we sat down to develop a new camera that
is small affordable and reversible
we built our the new design
we call it the panono camera the camera
is tough so you can throw it in the air
and even drop it on occasion
there are several easy ways to use it
firstly of course by throwing it but you
can also put it on the stick and hold it
in the air or simply hold it in your
hand and press a button to make a
picture all the panoramic images in this
video was shot with our prototype
hi my name is Anthony and I'm a founding
partner of mighty Audio mighty plays
your Spotify music on the go without a
smartphone it's the perfect device for
your active life and it's the first of
its kind know where their product
currently on the market lets you play
your Spotify music without being
connected to a smartphone mighty was
born from personal frustration with the
current on-the-go music experience
several years ago I ditched music
downloading for music streaming the only
thing missing after I switched was a
seamless and integrated experience
during my workouts fast forward to today
and every option of stream music still
requires a smart phone while exercising
we all know how annoying it is to work
out with a bulky smartphone who phones
are only getting bigger more expensive
and consuming more battery life and
heaven forbid if you drop your phone
iPod shuffles are still around but they
don't have any streaming capabilities
and let's not forget the painful syncing
process that requires cords and
computers smartwatches and trackers I've
hit the scene but many of them still
can't play Spotify music and the ones
that do still require you to have your
smart phone so kind of defeats the
purpose I was shocked that there was no
product out there that solved my problem
so I thought to myself well if no one
else is going to create this product
then I'm going to give it a shot my tea
is very easy to set up syncing music
never requires cords and computers just
Bluetooth and your smart phone after you
download the app onto your phone and
turn on the device that will
automatically detect your vices to pair
with via bluetooth once connected you'll
be asked to sign into your Spotify
account after logging in you can sync
all your playlists onto the mighty
device in the same way that you would
sing playlists for offline play on your
phone on here you'll see all your
current playlists as well as how much
memory you're using
after a quick sync your music is on your
mighty and you're ready to go no more
phone required at this point we honestly
think a screen is unnecessary we are
proud to be the first ones to bring a
device like this to market we're ultra
focus on this one problem and we want to
solve it elegantly and simply music is a
part of almost everyone's life and so we
want my tea to be the bridge between
your music and your fitness
hey I'm Adrian the Canadian and welcome
to life pack the anti-theft
solar-powered backpack that keeps your
phone charged and your stuff safe let's
check it out the 21st century has
redefined the way that we live our lives
you're no longer tied to an office 37
percent of US workers say they work from
home in the past month that's up over
400 percent since 1995 I'm pretty sure
that your phone's been upgraded since
then and it's time that your bag was -
with life pack we've reinvented the
mobile office does your phone battery
ever die are you ever worried about your
bag getting stolen or broken into do you
have a hard time keeping organized well
lucky for you life hacks here to save
the day let's start with why you're
never gonna have to deal with a dead
phone again the solar bank is a
removable unit which has a solar panel
and battery with enough power to charge
an iPhone 6 up to 12 times you can
charge the solar bank via USB then when
you're out and about the solar panel
keeps the power topped up the solar bank
also has built-in Bluetooth speakers so
you have great sounding audio with you
when you're on the go life back has an
integrated lock this means you can lock
the zipper shut when you're on the go
and what's really cool about this lock
is that you can actually lock the bag to
something when you're sitting still
because of the unique design of the
zippers you can also lock the zipper
shut while locking it to a fixed point
the bottom of the cable can not be
removed and the exit point is reinforced
so it's super strong also the end of the
lock works is a bottle opens cheers
salud so on things go the work zone is
incredibly organized is a separate
section for your laptop iPad that is
faced for your wallet there's a key hook
business cards pens there's also a
section for loose papers and a separate
pocket so you don't lose receipts
in the life zone is a protected pocket
for your sunglasses as room for clothes
and end of your non-work stuff because
you don't want your undies falling out
in a work meeting because we all know
that time is that just me that's
happened to there are 4 hidden
compartments on this bag on your
shoulder straps are two pockets these
are big enough for credit cards travel
cards for the subway or Metro cash loose
change or even your headphones pressed
up to your back or two more hidden
pockets these are ideal for your
passport and boarding card when
traveling these pockets are even big
enough for an iPhone 6 plus and on one
side there's a USB plug that connects to
the sewing bag so you can charge your
phone up while you're on the go
Gaming today is a two-dimensional
product experience is limited to sight
and sound and so we're providing a new
dimension it's a suit
it's a haptic product that provides
sensory stimulation taking the user into
the game whether it be sound sensations
of touch the idea of the impact Eric
will put you into that experience that
you've always wanted there are three
major components to this suit there's
the decoder the exoskeleton and the sim
skin the decoder is the piece that
attaches actually to your console or
platform takes information that it
brings that and sends it to the
exoskeleton the exoskeleton is now the
component that sort of has all the
pieces in airag that you're wearing from
the nervous system which is the feedback
to the control center which takes the
information from the decoder as well as
the power supply to make sure it's
wireless
the sound that we're providing is a
patented sound it's quite a different
experience we want to make it a surround
sound feel so the idea is we have six
speakers two on the front on this side
two on that side and then on the back
one here and one here as well as a
subwoofer you're always in the sweet
spot no matter where you are
and as for like vibratory feedback right
now it's always been to the controller
so you feel a rumble in your hand now
we're actually getting it so it's
located on the specific parts your body
where it should be there are sixteen
points on the front eight points on the
side and sixteen points on the back
alright so first thing we're going to do
is I'm going to test this in vibrational
stuff so to start with I'm just going to
set a value here and I'm going to be top
right you feel that yeah all right so
let's switch that over to bottom left
and we're with you yeah which is awesome
so that's pretty much how vibration
works as for stems they're pretty much
focused on particular muscles it
contracts the muscles it can either give
a full contraction or it can be a slight
contraction once again same thing top
right so they just supply you okay there
alright shut that off how you feeling we
can see it moving your shoulder forward
like that yeah I nothing we'll wait
alright so that's pretty much it for the
basic fundamentals what air I can
actually do so what do you think of it
it was pretty interesting and that
really experienced anything like that
yeah virtual world awareness you
actually inside the world that you're
playing it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
