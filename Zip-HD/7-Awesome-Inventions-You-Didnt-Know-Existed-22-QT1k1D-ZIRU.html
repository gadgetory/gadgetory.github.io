buying more hit the notebook industry
has given up on innovation okay what's
this
the notebook Hemingway wrote on that's
cool I guess we're from rocket book and
we make notebooks from the future at
rocket book we are already famous for
inventing the wave notebook the smart
notebook that can be erased in the
microwave we've shipped 100,000 waves to
satisfied customers around the world

but we are maniacs obsessed with
blending old fashioned notebooks with

in the rocket lab designing a new
notebook that feels like pen and paper
but is endlessly reusable and completely
integrated with your digital lifestyle
introducing the Everlast notebook from
rocket book the Everlast brings cloud
scalability to pen and paper simply
write a scan and a rate imagine one
thousand of your favorite notebooks in
one sleek design that fits in your
backpack and here's how it works
Everlast pages and look and feel like
paper but they're actually constructed
from a polyester composite rather than
would you write on the Everlast using
any pen from the pilot FriXion live
which are available in-store and online
writing on the Everlast feels perfectly
natural and smooth and as the ink dries
it forms a complete bond to the
polyester page so it won't rub off but
what makes this formulation so unique is
that each page can be wipes completely
cleaned with a moist towel so it can be
used over and over and over again
the Everlast notebook is also compatible
with the rocket book app so before you
wipe your notes off the page you can
last them online to your favorite cloud
services in a fraction of a second
rocket book machine vision scans
enhances and send each page to the
specific destination they belong on the
cloud services you already use each
Everlast notebook page has seven symbol
set up the rocket book app to assign
each symbol to a location within Dropbox
Google Docs and Evernote or many other
services you could configure your
diamond to send meeting notes directly
to your shared team folder in Dropbox
and/or students between figure there's a
star symbol suspend notes write to a
math folder in Google Drive so you can
make your list break out that diagram or
color in that drawing then tomorrow
