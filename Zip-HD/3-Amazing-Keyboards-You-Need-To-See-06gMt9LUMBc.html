the hemming right is a distraction-free
writing tool it combines the simplicity
of a typewriter with all the convenience
of digital documents you don't have to
remember sinking saving sending or
anything it all happens automatically
and all the time so we've all been there
before you're in a jam to finish writing
a paper and what do you do you carefully
collect all the things you need into
your backpack and hike down to the
coffee shop and before long instead of
being busy on your paper you're busy on
Facebook we engineered the hemming right
to do one thing and do it sublimely well

the box there are no pop-up
notifications application settings or
menus of any kind it simply just works
hi I'm Aries Aukerman and I want to show
you one of the world's most unique
keyboards the ergo doc cz it's a
mechanical keyboard which means the keys
make a very satisfying crunch it
literally feels like you're getting
stuff done as you're typing their Galaxy
Z is composed of two separate halves so
you can position each hand exactly where
you want it for complete control of your
typing angle the layout of the keys
within each F is also economic because
it straight and linear not staggered
like on most keyboards
we can even say each individual keys
ergonomic because the ergo doc cz lets
you decide what every key does whatever
works for you there Galaxy Z is special
for a crowdfunded project because it's
not a gamble dear Crocs is a proven
designer and people are already using it
out in the wild you can google for area
docs reviews right now and read what
other people say about it
that's because the erga docs design is
open source anybody can make it but so
far nobody has been making it at scale
you had to buy a $200 DIY kit and solder
over 160 pieces on your own including
some that are as tiny as grains of rice
even getting this DIY kids sometimes
required months of waiting soldering the
kit on your own can be fun for some
people but it's not everybody's cup of
tea I really wanted the air guitars for
myself but I realized I just don't have
the time to assemble it from scratch I
wanted an area Docs that came in a nice
box and had a manufacturer's warranty
and I figured I wasn't the only one so
we partnered with a team of Taiwanese
hardware engineers who have over 20
years of experience in making heavy-duty
mechanical keyboards and we're making
the area Docs available to everyone as a
complete polished product
