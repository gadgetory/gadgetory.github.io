you
this is cosmo cosmo cosmo cosmo is a
rambunctious little kid a little bit
mischievous he's smart a lot of robots
in a very small package all the
technology inside of cosmo is really
there for one reason to bring the magic
of robotic character to life it's a very
complex system and ask for transmissions
inside of it with probably 40 or 50
years each robot is made out of over 300
different parts there's the AI system
the robotic accelerometers the animation
gyros the computer vision we're running
an extremely complicated artificial
intelligence inside the robots which
needed to make thousands and thousands
of decisions per second he's a mobile
manipulator he can drive around the
world you see you can recognize you he
looked up at me and - whoa and I was
like whoa he just recognized me gives
you goosebumps because you realize that
this is a little character who actually
understand who you are and what role you
play in his world figuring out the path
to a unique personalities it's an
ongoing question I think we do about
40-50 Studies on just little nuances
looking at the interface with the
monitor where the eyes I'm going to look
at you cross would move the heads and
crawl of the field every little detail
have its special attention paid to it we
literally have a rigged up version of
Cosmo in Maya where our animators can
animate him using the exact same
technique that they would use for
digital character because the output
isn't rendered the output is actually
Cosmo caving in the real
we've been looking for ways to make it a
little more organic more intersect so
that it feels more than he made it sound
is a critical piece it's the one
dimension where we have full control
just like in a movie or a video here
we're building his procedural voice
system we're doing all these things so
that as you interact with Cosmo he
becomes his own thing
one of the things that make Cognos feel
surprising and so loveable or that he
defies your expectation we're creating
something that really does feel like
it's part of the family
those are the moment we usually don't
share with machines or robots until now
Cosmo is a pioneer for the ability to
create characters and health stories in
the real world with the technology which
you make additional characters with new
capabilities we personality at a level
that we've never seen before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
