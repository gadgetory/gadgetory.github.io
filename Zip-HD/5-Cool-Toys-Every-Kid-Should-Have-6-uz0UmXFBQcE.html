our it's an energy field created by all
living things it's grounded and a
traitor it binds the Galaxy together may
the force be with you
hoo-wee opposes
combats me
host volume
Oh
yeah
meet Riley the app bot is always on the
move Riley the robot you can control
with your smartphone over Wi-Fi or from
anywhere around the world through the
internet just download the app and link
up that's it
Riley easy to maneuver with multiple
speeds so there's no job he can't do
let's for work in a rush that's okay
Riley can check to make sure your doors
are locked
uptown Riley and send you alerts from a
built-in motion detector who needs a pet
sitter
Riley's great with animals soon he'll
even be your kid new best friend then
thanks to the built-in speaker and
microphone the days of yelling across my
house are over yeah instead of
traditional wheel
Riley has rookie belt so he can easily
tackle any surface wood floor carpet
friend Riley can conquer it all well
almost
Angela's wobble belts of different
colors he's always in style - uh-oh
battery low Riley knows when he needs to
recharge but that doesn't mean he's off
duty even from the docking station he
can monitor your home overnight
well time to power down tomorrow and
another busy day good night
here's a list of stuff from kind of
magical to unbelievably magical body
wash that's also shampoo Mentos and cola
things except sly with your help the
magical is about to get magical a week
shy a pilot an industrial designer and
an inventor he loves things that fly he
wants to try to turn his car into an
airplane no success shy Olli said that
his dream was to bring the joy of flight
to everyone few years ago he made a
breakthrough in the field of cold stuff
that flies he invented the power of the
first electric paper airplane but then a
friend of scheisse told him nice gadget
really but you can't make a
remote-controlled paper airplane so I
took a moment to think and said
challenge accepted two years of research
and 57 prototypes later he made it
happen
Meech eyes unbelievably magical
tension power up three the first ever
smartphone controlled paper airplane
using state-of-the-art technology power
up three turns your embarrassing paper
plane into a lean mean flying machine
just fold a piece of copy paper to a
plane caps power up three and install
the app now call your mom and tell your
pilot because it works out of the box in
the back of the module are a propeller
and a rudder that are in charge of
controlling the plane in the front there
is an advanced ship with powerful
Bluetooth smart technology for an
amazing 60 yards of controlled flight
and a tiny rechargeable battery to power
this amazing beat out of juice charge
the battery with any micro USB cable
absolute in his career as a pilot planes
should be building and flying and for
crashing that's why all components of
the powerup 3 are super durable and
crash proof but here's where shy made it
really cool power up threes smart shape
is program to optimize user happiness
you don't need a PhD in Aero now to be
able to fly it
[Laughter]
