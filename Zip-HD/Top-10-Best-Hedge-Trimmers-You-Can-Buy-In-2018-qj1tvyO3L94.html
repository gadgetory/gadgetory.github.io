hassle-free operation no cord no gas no

you a closer look at the Toro Power Plex
24-inch hedge trimmer now I have to
admit I'm one of those guys whose cord
takes this beating every time I turn my
hedges so I am all about the cordless
hedge trimmer plus it's a lot easier to
reach the corners of the yard without
trying to stretch from an outlet but is
it powerful enough you ask I'll tell you
the t90 battery really does pack a punch
and with up to 60 minutes of runtime
you'll have plenty of juice to get your
yard done now my favorite thing about
the power flex hedge trimmer is the
90-degree rotating handle that makes it
way more comfortable to trim vertically
but the real key to this hedge trimmer
is the design and construction of the
blade the dual action cutting system
reduces vibration and the hardened extra
thick steel blades cut through branches
with ease the shape of the Toro design
blade is really unique to their craft of
legates curves that actually grab the
branch and hold it in place so the cut
more cleanly and efficiently of course
as with all of the Power Flex tools you
can always purchase it without the
battery and quick charger if you've
already got those from other Power Plex
tools or you can upgrade to the T 180
battery for up to double the runtime REO
b1 plus 18 volt hedge trimmer brings
cordless convenience making it easy to
maintain your shrubs and hedges shaping
your hedges is a breeze with the 500
millimeter cutting bar as it reduces the
need to overreach which is quite common
when using these tools the dual action
blade system lowers vibrations and
delivers an efficient cleaner cut this
in turn is
harmful to the ends of the foliage that
can cause browning of the tips the
rotating rear handle rotates 90 degrees
left and right allowing greater comfort
and control with increased safety when
trimming at various angles a mechanical
anti jamming system protects the tool in
instances where a branch or maybe plant
securing wire becomes lodged within the
cutting teeth
