several years ago we were enjoying lunch
and talking about how people were going
to be interacting with technology in the
next five to ten years and we were
looking around and seeing how people
were really distracted by the very
things that we're supposed to make their
lives easier we thought to ourselves
there has to be a better way and that's
when we came up with the idea of the UB
ooby is a Wi-Fi enabled voice operated
computer that plugs into an outlet and
makes the environment around it Internet
enabled you talk to the Ruby and Ruby
speaks back
you can look up quick facts send emails
and play music just by asking for it
Looby also has sensors on it that can
help you to understand your environment
you can set up alerts and get notified
if something unusual happens at your
home okay we send a message to John
please speak the content hi John I'm
running late I'll see you in 20 minutes
SMS sent to John
okay you be remind me in ten minutes
to check on the rice alarm created three
twenty seven pm check on the rice but
this is really only the start we're
going to be adding more ways to interact
with you be soon you'll be able to
control home automation devices like
flies and thermostat and you're hoping
to roll out the ability to make calls
work with your calendar and contacts and
connect with thousands of different
internet services and devices we're
essentially building something like a
human brain it's a system that will
eventually understand you and augment
your capabilities
it'll help better organize your life
chime in when you need it and fit the
background on your own join us in
uttering in this era of ubiquitous
computing

open-source communities have undeniably
revolutionized the digital world but now
it's time to take things one step
further we're applying that same
methodology personal transportation and
by standardizing the basic hardware and
software we've made it easy for anyone
to design share and sell their own
personal short distance vehicle we call
it flex Peavy
we want you to make a vehicle so we can
go to have lunch in a diner which is not
too far away but no nearby neither so as
the guys what's the best in your mind by
table open clicker girls Gator well
then I thought about what's the common
part they have how about we make a
electric motor for anything you slap it
on and then you get your ride flex Vivi
contains three Universal modules the
motor battery and controller installed
in Flex PV is as easy as paying with
Lego just fascinate to any object with
universal brackets you can convert a
normal scooter enjoying life check one
in less than 10 minutes to convert a
bike or skateboard is even faster what
you need to do is just the tightening
screws and connecting cables once you
are done you can control flex TV with
the mobile app and the remote control is
coming soon
honey where's the USB charger we use USB
to charge our devices everyday but we
can't plug them directly into our walls
instead we use USB adapters or hardwired
products both have their problems
adapters are bulky take up outlet space
and always end up missing hard wired
products require you to completely
remove your existing outlet and rewire a
new one in its place at snap power we
thought there should be an easy way to
plug your USB cords directly into the
wall so we created the snap power charge
it's the first-ever USB charger built
right into an outlet cover plate and you
can use it to charge all your USB
devices now anyone can quickly and
easily add a USB charging port to any
standard outlet in their home
the only installation required is
swapping out the old cover plate for the
new one it's that simple
our power prong technology does all the
work for you by automatically pulling
its power from the screws on the sides
of your outlet the snap power charger
also leaves both outlets open and
available for use now you can charge
your devices through your cover plate
and reclaim your outlets for all of your
other important things and with its
sleek low-profile design it's sure to
blend in anywhere in just seconds you
can make any standard outlet in your
home USB compatible the snap power
charger truly is the most convenient
simple and attractive USB charging
solution for your entire
for many years I've had frustration
towards my lotion bottle I love to buy
lotion bottles with the palms but I can
never get to the bottom there's so much
lotion left in the bottle when the pump
stops working
I feel wasteful and posture we've
designed a solution for this problem
it's the zero waste cap the zero waste
cap is a specialty cap that helps you
get lotion out of the bottle after the
pump stops working to use the zero waste
cap simply attach the pump
attach the zero waste cap and flip the
bottle upside down and gravity does the
rest the wide cap provides a stable base
the lotion settles to the bottom and
it's easy to remove the zero waste cap
comes with adaptors so it fits on almost
any lotion bottle to change the adapters
squeeze the tabs while the adapter and
snap in the other one oh and dishwasher
safe
with the zero waste cap not only can you
save money by using contents that would
have otherwise been wasted you can also
be more green by throwing away
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
