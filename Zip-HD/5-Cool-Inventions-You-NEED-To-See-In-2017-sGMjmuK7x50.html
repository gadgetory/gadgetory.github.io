I've got bulgur man sometimes at very
important moments your battery dies cut

often we can't have just one scene in

built-in power bank so you can charge
any phone up to 100% okay what about my
phone and you can charge your phone
wirelessly yeah my Superman I'm not
Superman
I've got voltar man the idea of Ultraman
started two years ago and our team of
engineers and designers have been
working tirelessly on creating a perfect
mix of design and technology and here it
is in its final shape packed with super
abilities
what if I mean handsome ah they're
vulgar man again not this time
that was a home meet your personal
Superman there are two verbs that
describe what a plane does there's
flying and there's life
meet powerup darts a paper airplane
that's not just flying it's flying
this is shy a pilot industrial designer
and inventor shy loves everything
airborne four years ago he was
challenged by a friend to create a
smartphone controlled paper airplane
which I accepted the challenge and
created powerup 3 the first ever
smartphone controlled paper airplane
then 2 years ago that same friend
challenged him to put a camera on the
plane so shy created powerup fpv the
first-ever smartphone controlled paper
airplane with a streaming camera shiz
friend looked at those creations and
said cool but you can't make a paper
plane that can do a loop and a barrel
roll and then stall turn then just I
stopped his spread before he
hyperventilated and said challenge
accepted now after a year of prototyping
and testing it's here powerup Dart
the first ever smartphone controlled
paper airplane that can do aerobatics
yes
other planes can fly but they can't loop
or barrel roll or fly bird eclis dart
can it is incredible and it is small
just take a piece of paper fold it into
a plane that's the module download the
app and tell your friends GeForce got
nothing on you you're an aerobatic pilot
now powerup dark gets its incredible
aerobatic capability from the high
thrust-to-weight ratio and unique shape
of the plane despite being so incredible
flying the dart is easy and intuitive
move the phone to any direction and the
wings will follow when you start the
plane goes to 70% of its throttle so you
can fly it like a regular player but
press the boost button and you give the
plane that extra kick that transforms it
into a flying monster a small flying
monster power-ups Bluetooth module
easily charges through its microUSB port
and the entire thing is made of carbon
fiber an island so it's nearly
indestructible dart invites you to make
many planes in many shapes because every
plane brings with it new tricks and with
them new gasps for air try 5 10 50
planes then fly them all together make a
real show arrange dogfights break every
barrier previously set by less
incredible planes and this little bugger
is so cool it can even fly around the
office yeah
dear uncle remember when my friends and
I we had an idea to create the world's
first smart suitcase remember that we
went to you to borrow some money and you
said drop it
this is what is my suitcase you
morons
well dear uncle a few things happen
since then we gathered our friends and
family we made a video we went to the
internet and we launched a crowdfunding
campaign we had 10,000 people ordering
the product 10,000 travelers so we moved
to Hong Kong the team got bigger and we
slept in factories until we shipped the
product then everyone received their new
bags they traveled everywhere they told
their friends and things went crazy
here's the fastest man alive
here's Shaquille O'Neal Tony Hawk Casey
nice that even the Pope got one we got
tons of feedback we listened to everyone
and I mean everyone go play with the bag
we took notes of everything we kept
learning improving designing an executor
to change the game again so thank you
uncle you pushed us to do better and
here is better
meet series two not one but four
products check cabin and laptop bag and
passport pouch all connected to our new
app an able in global location tracking
super charging capabilities digital auto
locking system smart weight sensors
powered by our next-generation
technology to transform the way you
travel the new cabin now 25% bigger
inside charges all your devices
including laptops and the new check
features for smart weight sensors that
sync with your airline and prevent you
from paying baggage fees both suitcases

anywhere
the laptop bag charges all your devices
as you move notifies you if you leave it
behind its TSA friendly expandable and
has every single pocket a traveler needs
and the new passport pouch also connects
to the app making your passport
impossible to forget built with high
quality water resistant materials the
best protector for all of your
essentials
this is what smart travel looks like all
products working together as a system to
assist you along the journey
this is Blu smart series 2 we live in an
age of on-demand boobies can now be
watched anywhere anytime on various
devices such as mobile phones tablets
and laptops but with that there's a
problem none have been able to capture
the magic of a cinema movies are losing
their magic but what if we could have
the comfort of watching films at home
but with an experience that would exceed
that of a movie theater introducing
sanera the world's first fully immersive
personal cinema a headset that brings
you an IMAX like movie experience in the
size of a book
while a normal cinema on average gives
you an angle of around 54 degrees the
scenario screen is considerably larger
and on par with a 70 degree angle of the
IMAX screen to guarantee the image
quality on its super wide screen sanera
uses groundbreaking dual 2.5 k displays
with a resolution three times that of a
cinema and eight times that of an iPhone
7 plus driving such high resolution is
beyond the capabilities of any existing
mobile processors on the market
unlike existing products which split a
single screen into two and only use the
central part of the screen saneras dual
screen architecture utilizes up to 95
percent of the screen area which
achieves four times the sharpness and
fully alleviates the screen door effect
sanera is also super easy to use it
works like any Android smartphone you
can install your favorite streaming apps
like Netflix or HBO or play from a
microSD card it also works like a TV by
simply connecting the headset to a
blu-ray player gaming console or a
computer with a simple click sanera
upgrades your conventional entertainment
to an immersive and cinematic experience
because of comfortable experience using
sanera has always been one of our top
priorities we designed an ergonomic
hands-free arm to take the weight off
the headset the burden free arm can be
easily adjusted to any position and can
be attached to different surfaces it
allows for a new way of watching movies
burden free truly immersed in the movie
without discomfort
besides video the audio has been
fine-tuned to recreate the acoustics and
sound effects of a movie leader the
scenario 3d mode is easy to turn on and
provides more vivid and brighter 3d
images than those in theaters without
the need for 3d glasses it is a much
better way to watch 3-d movies life can
get rough hate crimes are on the rise
street harassment is rampant abuse of
power often goes unaddressed it's not
hard to imagine it happening to you
perpetrators think that they can get
away with it because in many cases it's
going to be their word against yours
unless you have video proof that's why
we're making the children scream can a
wearable personal security camera that
instantly secures video in the cloud
using cellular networks shown in stream
cam is almost completely hands-free
it doesn't require any precision and
starts documenting your experience at
the tap of a button stream cam provides
a choice of cellular or Wi-Fi
connectivity and your videos are
uploaded automatically to secure a cloud
and any video remaining on the camera
itself is completely encrypted you can
set the camera to record to whatever
destination you want using the Shonan
app you can record to micro SD card
stream to the Shonan cloud or set it to
broadcast to services like Facebook live
you can even set it to stream and record
to micro SD at the same time the Shonan
app makes it easy to customize almost
anything on the device and also provides
an easy way to instantly watch and share
your video we've also designed Shonen
stream cam to be rugged and waterproof
so you can depend on it to work in any
environment and just like a security
camera shown in stream cams visibility
and iconic design can act as a possible
deterrent to aggressors
the simple clipping mechanism lets you
easily wear the device in multiple ways
without struggling with mounts or having
to buy new equipment but Shonen stream
cam does work with Universal mounts as
well and if you need more recording time
you can simply snap on the extended
battery pack Shaun in stream cam works
in any scenario biking to work going for
a run
walking home at night or joining marches
or protests whenever you need a witness
on your side showing stream cam is there
ready for anything</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
