buy a filter again and the BOD makes up
to 15% more extract than other cold
Brewers best of all it's super easy to
use here's how it works just add coarse
ground coffee to the stainless filter
attach the filter cap and insert the
filter cartridge into the brew chamber
fill with cold water to the fill line
and brew for 12 to 24 hours with the
removable count up timer you can
discover your perfect brew number each
brew cycle produces 24 ounces of super
concentrated sediment free coffee
extract that makes 10 to 12 cups of hot
or iced coffee after brewing just flip
to transfer the coffee extract into the
built-in bean Canty's which stores
conveniently in the refrigerator for
hotter iced coffee on demand you can
even rebou the grounds a second time and
get three additional cups of regular
strength coffee the coffee extract is
super convenient for a hot cup of coffee
in seconds pour 1 to 3 ounces of coffee
extract using the easy port twist taps
into the shot glass to measure and
dilute with hot water to taste for iced

control over answering your door when
I'm home alone in the doorbell rings it
can be unsettling and kind of
inconvenient with Sky Bell I can see
who's on the other side before I even
answer the door the idea was born from
everyday situations I mean don't you
wish you can know who's at the door
before you stop what you're doing answer
it want to see who's there when you're
not home but the kids are and what about
when it's dark but we're making all that
possible and we're doing it with minimal
design and cutting-edge technology so
how does it work

conditions skybell works internationally

standards and it's compatible with G and
MB wireless networks skybell is made in
the USA right here in Southern
California
we all have something in our life that
we want to improve for me last year it
was living healthier so I began
exercising and eating better but for a
long time I still felt sluggish and
tired it's like where did all of my
energy go and then I realized that I
forgot the most important part drinking
water
we are tracking everything about our
body right now our exercise our sleep
our diet but there's no easy way for us
to track the most essential thing to a
body water it's the next piece of the
puzzle I thought there must be a
solution here so I got my friends
together and in 54 hours we built our
first makeshift prototype of a smart
water bottle it tracks how much water
you drink and think that over to your
phone it was really rough but it worked
and our big question was could we make
this real so we quit our jobs packed our
bags and left everything familiar behind
to work on a product that we believed in
a hydrate NEET is a smart water bottle
that tracks your daily water consumption
and syncs to an app on your phone so you
can stay hydrated all day long it's
simple so you enter a few things about
yourself and the app will calculate your
daily water goals the bottle connects to
your phone via bluetooth and there's a
sensor that tracks how much water you
drink so you don't have to think about
it so if you've forgotten to drink water
the bottle will glow to remind you and
the battery lasts for over a year so
you'll never have to charge it it syncs
with your favourite wearables and
fitness apps and so if you go on a long
run or workout it'll increase your daily
water goal to make sure you stay
hydrated the app can use your location
to account for the temperature humidity
and elevation of your surroundings so if
you're in Colorado and the mountains the
app will remind you to drink more we
carry our water bottles with us
everywhere so we wanted to make
something that was sleek elegant and
smart and could transition from the gym
the office so something that is
technically advanced but doesn't look
like a tech product because we wanted to
be natural almost like a natural
extension of yourself
