part of any installation job but what if
you could do it faster easier with less
effort and minimize the risk of damage
you can introducing the airship the
airship brings a brand new one man
approached to leveling prying and moving
objects of all shapes and sizes up to
300 pounds once you start using the
airship you'll wonder how you ever got
along without it the airship allows you
to lift shift a line level and plumb
faster or more accurately than ever
before you normally need two people to
level something out the airship would
cut it down probably 75 to 80% of the
time to a one-person job which will save
on manpower which will get the job done
quicker and save money in the long run
the airship is simple to use place it
where you need pressure or support
squeeze the ball to inflate it to the
desired position or level of pressure
use air shims bleeder valve to make
precise adjustments secure the objects
position and deflate the airship for
tricky installations use multiple air
shims and eliminate the need for that
extra set of hands how they can take a
pretty good beating and a lot of weight
on them I would highly recommend them we
put some pretty big cabinets on them and
some really heavy entry doors and it
didn't phase and they work just fine air

shim is brought to you by calculated
industries for over 35 years we've been
bringing high quality time-saving
precision and cost cutting tools to pro
carpenters and tradesmen they were great
they're easy to use not too bulky you
just slide them in pump them up you want
to release pressure these nice little
valves reduce pressure instead of having
to dig out the wood shims or hit them in
