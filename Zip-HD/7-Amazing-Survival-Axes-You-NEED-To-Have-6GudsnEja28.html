the downrange tomahawk I've been a
engineer and designer and inventor for
about 14 years now and I've designed a
lot of knives and multi tools that you
might be familiar with I came up with
the idea for the clacks last year over
the last six months I've been designing
developing prototyping and testing out
the clacks to end up with the floor
versions that we have here today the
clacks is more than an axe the clacks is
a multi-tool built into the head of an
axe it has a lot of useful features
carabiner thumb jimping this is the
bottle opener the axe blade
the scraper lanyard hole the hammer with
a built-in ruler five wrench sizes and a
hex bit driver the clacks has a lot of
useful features like wrenches hammer
head and scraper along with our
innovative new clamping system that
allows you to take the axe to the field
and be able to break it down for easy
transport relax is useful for people who
are involved in hiking climbing camping
survival experts people who do bushcraft
all sorts of things including emergency
preparedness I'm Mike peel for Mike Pihl

logger the clacks it's a great tool this
morning I used it to wedge over a
Douglas fir tree and it did a good job
this is a clacks lumberjack it's our
most popular model because it includes
all of the features this is the clacks
woodsman the clacks woodsman has the
clamping system carabiner hammer the axe

paracord out and wrapping it around the
handle like you would a tomahawk this is
the tie clacks the tie clacks is a
titanium version of the clocks
lumberjack it is our top of the line
model and it includes all of the
features plus it has blue anodized
highlights and it comes weighing in at
half of the weight of the feller that's
why the tie clacks
