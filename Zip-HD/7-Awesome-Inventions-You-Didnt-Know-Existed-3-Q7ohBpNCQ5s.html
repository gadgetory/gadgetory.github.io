experienced chef things don't always go
as you plan in the kitchen sometimes the
dish turns out undercooked and sometimes
things end up burn
simple temperature control is still an
unsolved problem in the kitchen
Atmel we want to change that we want to
help people cook the perfect meal every
time we build the MELD knob clip and add
that together make up the world's first
automatic temperature cooking control
system that work with your existing
cooktop and cookware this is the MELD
knob and it's the key to controlling
temperatures the MELD knob replaces the
existing knob on your gas or electric
cooktop
it automatically turns the burner off or
down to keep the food at the perfect
temperature the MELD knob knows how to
adjust temperature based on data it
receives from the metal clip the clip
attaches to the cookware you already own
and continuously measures the
temperature of the food you are cooking
to within less than a degree this is the
meld app it contains hundreds of chef's
tested recipes that will automatically
control the burner and take the
guesswork out of cooking of course you
can make your own recipes or manually
control the knob if you'd like meld
reacts so quickly that as soon as you
add cold food to a pot it knows to turn
up the heat to maintain temperature and
it knows exactly when to turn it down
so nothing overcomes mellow controls the
temperature while you control the flavor
and meals come out perfectly each time
the MELD knob and clip are ideal for
slow cooking simmering sous-vide
poaching frying and even candy make
well crap going around it this sucks but
it's not the end of the world because I
got this little thing Hatchin ride it's
a new tool that makes having a flat tire
suck way less it's a quick and permanent
solution to fix just about any flat and
here's the real kicker you don't even
have to take off the wheel I used to be
just like you
shelling out big bucks for tubes and
tires regardless of how bad the damage
was occasionally I'd even try it on my
own
maybe you do too if your into that whole
self punishment thing not the cleanest
job in the world either basically I
murdered my bike let me show you how it
works
remove the cap from the patch and ride
tool insert it directly into the hole
pull back the slider then push forward
remove the tool then pump your tire full
of air and you're up and running or
trolling and patch and ride works for
all types of tires road bikes mountain
bikes cruisers kids bikes clincher and
tubular tubes even jogging stroller
tires pretty much anything with an inner
tube patch and rides cleaner for the
environment too with patch and ride you
reduce your carbon footprint by patching
instead of tossing that's pretty great
getting a flat tire sucks but patch and
ride makes it suck less

hi I'm Nikki and I'd like to introduce
you to hideaway the bottle you'll always
reach for because it's always within
reach experts suggest that for optimum
health
the average active person drink over 10
glasses of water every day but for those
of us who are always on the go it's
nearly impossible to stay hydrated
without reaching for disposable bottles
of water or sugary sports drinks bottled
water may be convenient but it's not
cheap it costs more than two thousand
times more than tap water even though
it's less regulated for health and
quality then there's the bottle every
minute US consumers throw out ninety
thousand plastic bottles and less than a
quarter are actually recycled the rest
end up in our landfills and in our
streets parks and beaches we need a
convenient solution to disposable
plastic bottles that fits our active
lifestyle
so as a freelance product designer I'm
traveling a lot visiting clients
visiting factories going to trade shows
I was looking for a water bottle that
would not take up a lot of space in my
carry-on and I started looking around
for a product that would work that would
still be functional and it wasn't out
there as I'm going through airports I'm
seeing so many travelers probably with
the same problem and I figured this is a
problem I could solve myself you know
once I had a solution for business
travel I realized this had great
application my personal life especially
in the outdoors going backpacking or
just on hikes I could bring water with
me and when the bottle was empty it it
collapses and goes away and takes no
extra space in my pack
