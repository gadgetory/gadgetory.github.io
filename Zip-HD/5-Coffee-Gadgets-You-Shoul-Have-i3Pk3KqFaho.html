discolored here is the story that
inspired creation of our product this
origin goes way way back in the history
once upon a time there was a man who
owned some goats
well lots of goats his goat stumbled
upon a bush of pretty red berries ate
them and then went bonkers let mend him
come up with the idea of brewing the
barrels
it resulted in a rich chocolate colored
beverage that made him free out of this
world this story and dedication to
coffee brought us together to design
something special the goat man it's
amazing in all aspects how it looks how
you carried and how your assembly it's
also sustainable bpa-free and 100% legal
the goatman is so special and so
different that we need your support to
make it come alive if you love the goat
story - we would be more than happy if
you share it among your friends we only
have one chance so support us and get
your own goats
hi everyone I'm Benson founder and CEO
of hours each type of coffee bean has
their specific way of extracting the
best favour for me
depending on ground size water
temperature and a lot more however
today's coffee machine doesn't provide
the level of flexibility to so and bring
it by hand is not precise and consistent
enough so we've created ours to brew the
best vapor of coffee to you in the most
specific precise and consistent way all
this might sounds complicated but ours
has simplified everything into a simple
machine and an easy-to-use smartphone
apps you can download all sorts of
recipe or even create your own one like
a professional now with the tap of
button you can brew coffee like your
world best barista this now we can have
complete control of our coffee tastes
while learning of new ones at the same
time and sharing with people all over
the world at anytime anyplace
arist is an intelligent coffee maker
it gives master baristas complete
control over coffee no matter where they
are from fine-tuning the grinder to
knowing exactly when to pull the shot
making great coffee requires accuracy
consistency and years of practice RS can
adjust each element of the brewing
process from temperature and pressure to
milk foam and syrup brewing professional
coffee can never be easier than this you
can control RS from your smartphone day
and night from customizing your coffee
to brewing it with a simple push of a
button
all can be done without interrupting
what you are doing simply enjoy your
favorite coffee with the most
convenience your local barista may have
a hard time spelling your name but RS
remembers you and offers you
recommendations based on your tastes it
can introduce you to brews you've never
heard of it introduces you to recipes
based on the coffee beans you have on
hand you can even program artists to
remember a specific cup and brew the
same beverage every time you use that
cup with orest
you can say goodbye to frustrating
scenes like this forever and this
we're rewriting the rules this is the
new normal
world class brews on demand
we clear domo one the only coffee maker
that uses coffee science to do the
perfect cocktail er to you science has
shown that coffee is made up of 1,500
chemicals which translates to 150
possible flavors and the aromas to get
the best cup of coffee brewing
parameters need to be controlled
precisely so only the desired flavours
are extracted current coffee makers
simply do not have enough sensors to do
this
the aroma one is equipped with a
patent-pending mechanism to
automatically provide the best spoon
controls it is the only to human to make
great coffee at home in order to make
most of each beam type coffee
professionals have spent years acquiring
deep coffee knowledge and mastery to
figure out what brewing parameters they
need to use the aroma one offers the
golden ratio recipes crafted by the
brochures themselves it also allows for
multiple recipes so you can even adjust
the level ISM strength the bitterness
caffeine kick and texture to make your
own perfect recipe
the aroma one learns your taste
preference and automatically adjusts the
parameters for you whether you're by
yourself or with a special someone
creating a personalized cup of coffee is
extremely easy convenient coffee meeting
has recently come at a high
environmental cost enough plastic pots
have been used to circle the Earth
twelve times the aroma one is created to
be extremely easy to use without
compromising quality or the environment
to brew coffee with your

available filter and press the button
this way you can focus and enjoying the
freshest cup Hui knowing that your
convenience doesn't ruin it for the next
generation you can even set it to brew
coffee right when your alarm goes off or
alert even the beans get low the aroma
one sets the new standard of convenience
performance and environmental
friendliness all in one gorgeous package
I'm changing and I love coffee however
the morning ritual of coffee
preparations started to frustrate me for
example the French president in your
teeth and that pour over that for over
is tedious I knew there had to be a
better way so eight months ago I
gathered a few of my friends who just
happen to be rocking product designers
and we set out to change the world or at
least design a cool coffee machine we
poured our hearts and souls into duo
every details intentional we explored
hundreds of design options played around
with a bunch of really cool toys built
over 50 prototypes and had a lot of fun
along the way the crafts shape alone
took us weeks to get just right return
phone prototype after foam prototype
until we landed on the absolute perfect
shape was this a bit excessive
maybe but we'll all be worth it when duo
fits perfectly in your hand and pours
effortlessly into your account our goal
is to create a product that can brew a
full bodied cup of coffee without
leaving any grounds left in the bottom
of your cup we worked with this super
smart Stanford PhD candidate to test
over 60 different filter combinations
after months and months of testing our
patent-pending dual filtration system
was born
Dule makes it easy for anyone to do
ridiculously good coffee in three easy
steps step one load up bad coffee and
hot water give it a quick stir and put
the lid on step two do nothing let do a
sit for three or four minutes the coffee
grounds in hot water unite step three
twist the coffee passes through our two
stage filtration system into the lower
chamber and that's it there's no need to
remove a dirty filter or clean up before
you drink the coffee
just pour and enjoy
we love coffee it's part of our lives
one of the best ways to bring out a more
full flavored brew with a deeper
sweetness and a syrupy body is with the
traditional French press but it's time
for an upgrade introducing simply press
a revolutionary redesign of the French
press clean delicious no mess hi I'm
Jenny Morris hi i'm scott morris it's
time to bring the french press into the
21st century into the third wave of
coffee well it all started with a mess
my french press would sit on the counter
for days not wanting to clean it out and
also when i did clean it out it would
get all over the counter and also when
i'm trying to get every ground out of
the actual carafe it broke on me if we
didn't grind the beans coarse enough the
grit would get through our french press
into our club and into our mouths not a
pleasant experience at all
one of the key features of simply press
is in this very innovative stainless
steel micromesh double filter it's
actually inspired by an espresso filter
which allows you to use fine medium and
coarse grounds we worked with a renowned
coffee scientist and after testing we
found that we extracted 40% more from
the coffee which means more flavor more
caffeine stronger coffee and a shorter
brewing time plus like choosing their
grind size you can actually tailor your
brew according to your taste and your
roast this allows you to truly
personalize your coffee experience we
chose the highest quality non-chemically
tree materials stainless steel silicon
and borosilicate Pyrex glass
