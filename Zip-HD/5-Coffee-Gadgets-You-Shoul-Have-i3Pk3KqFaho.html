discolored here is the story that
inspired creation of our product this
origin goes way way back in the history
once upon a time there was a man who
owned some goats
well lots of goats his goat stumbled
upon a bush of pretty red berries ate
them and then went bonkers let mend him
come up with the idea of brewing the
barrels
it resulted in a rich chocolate colored
beverage that made him free out of this
world this story and dedication to
coffee brought us together to design
something special the goat man it's
amazing in all aspects how it looks how
you carried and how your assembly it's
also sustainable bpa-free and 100% legal
the goatman is so special and so
different that we need your support to
make it come alive if you love the goat
story - we would be more than happy if
you share it among your friends we only
have one chance so support us and get
your own goats

I'm changing and I love coffee however
the morning ritual of coffee
preparations started to frustrate me for
example the French president in your
teeth and that pour over that for over
is tedious I knew there had to be a
better way so eight months ago I
gathered a few of my friends who just
happen to be rocking product designers
and we set out to change the world or at
least design a cool coffee machine we
poured our hearts and souls into duo
every details intentional we explored
hundreds of design options played around
with a bunch of really cool toys built
over 50 prototypes and had a lot of fun
along the way the crafts shape alone
took us weeks to get just right return
phone prototype after foam prototype
until we landed on the absolute perfect
shape was this a bit excessive
maybe but we'll all be worth it when duo
fits perfectly in your hand and pours
effortlessly into your account our goal
is to create a product that can brew a
full bodied cup of coffee without
leaving any grounds left in the bottom
of your cup we worked with this super
smart Stanford PhD candidate to test
over 60 different filter combinations
after months and months of testing our
patent-pending dual filtration system
was born
Dule makes it easy for anyone to do
ridiculously good coffee in three easy
steps step one load up bad coffee and
hot water give it a quick stir and put
the lid on step two do nothing let do a
sit for three or four minutes the coffee
grounds in hot water unite step three
twist the coffee passes through our two
stage filtration system into the lower
chamber and that's it there's no need to
remove a dirty filter or clean up before
you drink the coffee
just pour and enjoy
we love coffee it's part of our lives
one of the best ways to bring out a more
full flavored brew with a deeper
sweetness and a syrupy body is with the
traditional French press but it's time
for an upgrade introducing simply press
a revolutionary redesign of the French
press clean delicious no mess hi I'm
Jenny Morris hi i'm scott morris it's
time to bring the french press into the
21st century into the third wave of
coffee well it all started with a mess
my french press would sit on the counter
for days not wanting to clean it out and
also when i did clean it out it would
get all over the counter and also when
i'm trying to get every ground out of
the actual carafe it broke on me if we
didn't grind the beans coarse enough the
grit would get through our french press
into our club and into our mouths not a
pleasant experience at all
one of the key features of simply press
is in this very innovative stainless
steel micromesh double filter it's
actually inspired by an espresso filter
which allows you to use fine medium and
coarse grounds we worked with a renowned
coffee scientist and after testing we
found that we extracted 40% more from
the coffee which means more flavor more
caffeine stronger coffee and a shorter
brewing time plus like choosing their
grind size you can actually tailor your
brew according to your taste and your
roast this allows you to truly
personalize your coffee experience we
chose the highest quality non-chemically
tree materials stainless steel silicon
and borosilicate Pyrex glass
