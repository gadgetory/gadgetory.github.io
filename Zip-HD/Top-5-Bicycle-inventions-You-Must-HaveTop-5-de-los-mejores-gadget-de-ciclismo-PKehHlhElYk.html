we're going to be amazing that no matter
where you go in the world there's always
a bike waiting for you
the idea for air donkey grew from a
dream of a world where commuters
tourists and also people just enjoying
the city choose the bike before the car
hello my name is Arden and I'm Alexandra
we are from air donkey to make the dream
come true we sat down and developed an
ecosystem that we felt could motivate
people to use the bicycle as the main
means of transportation the Airbnb model
for bicycles the air donkey air donkey
is not just a product we bring together
the simplicity of uber the sharing
economy the Airbnb and the benefits of a
bicycle the idea is if you have a bike
that you're not using share it all you
need to do is sign up to get a donkey
kit you can now turn your spare bike
into a cheap to rent mean of
transportation that anyone with a donkey
app can locate and rent the donkey lark
is easy to mount and is completely theft
rain and false proof you can recharge
the battery with a USB cable and will
last for about a year attach the
instruction panel to the handlebar
to provide an easy-to-use guide for the
system you can also place Thank You
Republic stickers on your bike frame and
it will be easy to locate for any user
that's it your donkey is ready to roll
for bike owners the system gives you the
chance to earn money on having a spare
bike while sharing the good values of
biking you can set your own rental price
and define the zone where the user
should drop off the bike if you need
additional security you can use a leash
or a chain to lock your bike to
something
introducing smart tailor smart a low
isn't just another bike accessory in
fact it's not meant to be removed after
each ride it installs permanently on
handlebar and pairs with your smartphone
to turn your bike into a smart match and
provide a biking experience like no
