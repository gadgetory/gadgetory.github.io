stands behind each generator hi my name
is Brad and what we have here is a 1200
watt hour portable generator now the
first thing I notice about the device
here is its weight now inside this
battery here is several lithium ion
batteries which make it extremely
lightweight compared to the competition
most of our competition uses lead acid
batteries which makes a device similar
to this easily over 100 pounds so this
device with the handles here easy to
carry around and take car camping take
tailgating use an emergency prep kit
whatever you need because this 1200 watt
hours here is going to charge up your
devices hundreds of times so let's go
over the port's here what we have here
is some 12-volt inputs which are
compatible with our commander solar
chargers now also these inputs are
compatible with standard wall outlets
and overall this battery will take about
60 to 100 hours to fully charge what we
have here is three standard AC outlets
which are compatible with standard wall
outlet devices such as laptops mini
fridges televisions one standard 12 volt
output two-barrel 1200 outputs as well
three USB ports which charge smaller
devices such as tablets smartphones mp3
players even digital cameras it's
important note that this generates some
power this will charge a smartphone or
digital camera over 150 times a tablet
between 25 and 50 times in a laptop
around 20 times addition you can charge
standard devices such as TVs and mini
fridges will give you over 10 hours of
power what's special about this is that
I can charge devices simultaneously so
as you can see I can plug a laptop into
the standard three prong input as well
as charge a smartphone through its
integrated USB input right here overall
the generator 1200 is a portable
powerful lightweight generator that you
can take with you on the go to keep you
charged up for days at a time
we all need power but we always seem to
run out of it either because we choose
to enjoy nature away from the grid or in
disaster scenarios the grid chooses to
get away from us

callee pack of portable solar energy kit
that meets dozens of operate energy
needs
nature trails photography trips all-day
picnics disaster scenarios and
electricity shutdowns daily use in areas
with unstable electricity supply the
callee back is completely autonomous and
can fully charge from either the Sun a
car or a wall charger it's 38 a H
battery is powerful enough to charge
your iPhone up to 120 times and powerful
enough to provide energy for our entire
set for a whole day including a fridge
until we ran out of beer you can even
add a rain cover to keep the power going
in case of rain then a Bluetooth app for
easy management when designing the
callee packs our team focused on
developing a seamless off-grid user
experience with an all-inclusive kit an
optional daisy chain solar panel for
double charging power a cool app and
storage for your devices and accessories
the callee pack is a must for every
awkward scenario fully portable it
provides you with natural free energy
