if you are a seasoned outdoorsman then
you already know that using the right
equipment is essential when putting your
pack together you will understand the
grueling demands of the wilderness and
most of all you will have a respectful
appreciation for nature and know that
sometimes your equipment can be the
difference between life and death when
the lead engineer of survival archery
systems started developing the SAS
tactical survival bow
he was already aware of the need for
equipment that was properly engineered
having survived a near-death experience
in which his knowledge of the outdoors
together with some well chosen critical
equipment and literally saved his life
he set about developing a product for
food acquisition it would possibly one
day do the same for some owner having
spent a lifetime growing up in the woods
and having spent 15 years as an
automotive and petrochemical engineer he
set about developing a set of
requirements which encapsulate the eight
critical aspects of a survival though
that you should look for in a premium
product these critical aspects led to a
design which was launched after two
years of development and testing and now
the SAS tactical survival though is
solved technically the morning people
all over the world to understand the
need for premium equipment the package
Poland is critical to a compact design
and to overcome the need to strap your
boat to the outside of your pack it
absolutely must be 21 inches or under
within transport level the SAS tactical
survival boat comes in at all critical
length of 21 inches and even fits into
most one-day weeks in order to get a bow
that does not stack and is still
efficient you need to have the right
limb to rise a ratio as well as the
right overall in designing a 60-inch
long bow with a carefully chosen limb
terraza ratio gave the SAS tactical
survivable
perfect balance and a bow that does not
stack all the way past 31 inch draw for
long-term survival purposes it is
crucial that all working parts of a bow
are fully corrosion resistant and so
survival archery systems chose marine
grade materials throughout the only part
of the bow that is not fully corrosion
resistant although all important eye
tensile steel limb retaining bolts which
were chosen to give an extremely high
factor of safety in the field and only
require a light layer of animal fat or
oil to remain in perfect condition
durability is key for a survival bow and
so during the development the engineers
employed what is called design for
infinite life which basically means that
the theoretical design is capable of
withstanding
500 million shots f31 install going a
step further some hefty safety factors
were added to ensure a super light bulb
that will last more than a lifetime in
each composite limb with a through-hole
is prone to cracking around that hole
unless it is properly secured using a
correctly torqued bolt and washer system
the SAS tactical survival bow makes use
of a positive limb retention system to
ensure the limbs remain safe and secure
in the field having a compact bow is
important but having a solution to store
your arrows is critical to your choice
of a well rounded product the patented
SAS tactical survival bone is the only
bow in the market that allows for a
storage solution of arrows inside the
riser and this comes at no additional
cost
to space to reduce pack weight and ease
of use and maintenance free and truly
ambidextrous bow that requires no
changing of pods are the last two
critical aspects of a great survivable
the SAS tactical Volvo is the only truly
ambidextrous survival bow on the market
and requires no tools to maintain it or
convert it from left to right hand
simply placed an arrow rest on both
sides of the riser and swap it between
hands if you are looking for a premium
survival bone that captures these eight
critical elements then look no further
than the SAS tactical survivable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
