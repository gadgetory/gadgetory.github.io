phone out for every little thing what if
there was a simpler way to interact with
your advices flick is a wireless button
that connects to your iOS or Android
device so instead of going through your
phone you simply press the button that's
better I use the flick app to set it up
and then I can stick flick wherever I
want
I can even share this flick with my
roommate so he can use it when I'm not
around the flick isn't just for your
house you can stick your flicks anywhere
like in your car or on your bike
it's really cool
your destination is on the left
and you can clip your flesh it's great
for any situation where you need a quick
and discreet shortcut me me me me
like now oh I'm so sorry I have to take
this but flight can be so much more than
just a shortcut to your phone it could
be integrated with lots of different
services beyond your devices check this
one out
take the old cabbie
when I get home I want everything to
just take care of itself
Shh movies starting
another great feature of flick is that
it can be used as a safety device with
just a push of a button you can send
live updates of your location or even a
distress signal to your family and
friends
we have evolved alongside the honeybee
in the symbiotic relationship we care
for them they pollinate our crops and of
course make lots of delicious honey but
getting the golden nectar has always
been quite a task I just thought it was
crazy they'd have to crack the hive open
for the hive apart stress out all the
bees and spend all day in the shed just
to get your honey and I thought hmm
there must be a better way
so when dad and I got to work and we've
done it now you can simply turn a tab
and pure fresh honey flows right out of
your mind
delicious ready for you to eat that's
amazing it's amazing it's honey on tap
for those that don't know harvesting
your honey used to be a real labor of
love he had to protect yourself from
stings fire a smoker to sedate the base
cracked a hive open lift heavy boxes
pull out the frames try not to squash
bees brush them off the comb so use a
leaf blower transport the frames to a
processing shed cut the wax capping off
filter the honey and clean up all the
mess then the frames have to get back to
the hives again
now you don't need to do any of that
turner tap sit back and watch the honey
pour out it's pure unprocessed untouched
delicious honey directly from the hive
no mess no fuss no expensive equipment
and much more friendly for the bees this
is the first time in the world this has
been possible there is nothing else like
it it really is a revolution we can see
into the hive we can see when the
honey's ready and we can
take it away in such a gentle way what a
wonderful thing the flow frames are
designed with clear end so you can
easily check the huggers healthy and the
colonies Joan you can watch all the
girls handing nicked into honey and see
when it's ready and isolate individual
combs allowing you to taste all the
different flavours of the seasons you
can just have us one frame and get three
kilograms of honey I'll have us more
than 20 kilograms per box but you know
tap it off so easily
means that when there is a good honey
flow you can keep up with the bees and
harvest a lot more honey so how does it
work the flow frame consists have
already partly formed honeycomb cells
the bees complete the comb with their
wax and fill themselves with honey
capping it off ready for harvest when
you turn the handle our patented split
cell technology creates channels inside
the comb allowing the honey to flow down
and out of the hive while the bees are
undisturbed on the comb surface turn the
tap again which resets the comb into the
original position and allows the bees to
cheer the wax back and fill it with
honey again for the commercial beekeeper
the frames built to accommodate a
pneumatic system which means you can
flick a switch and harvest your whole
area at once
most everybody at one point has suffered
from cold feet
whether on their way to work while
walking skiing hiking or even riding
their bike or motorcycle what if you
could control the temperature of your
shoes with a simple click on your
smartphone what if your smartphone was
able to inform you about the distance
you've walked and the calories you
burned with digits all it's now finally
possible to do all this and more digits
all is the first connected interactive
heated insole which can be controlled
with your smartphone equipped with a
Bluetooth connection and a dedicated
application warming your feet and
tracking your day is as easy as a simple
click the digits all is very easy to use
just turn it on put it in your shoe and
launch the digit sole application
now look choose the temperature by
adjusting the slider to the desired
setting for each foot digit soul also
informs you about your daily performance
just enter your weight and height and
digits all tracks your steps indicates
how many calories you have burned shows
you precisely the distance you have
walked along with your current altitude
once the battery has depleted it can be
easily recharged with a simple USB cable
thanks to our self-regulating thermostat
system the high cap battery lasts from 7
hours to a few days depending on how you
use it then you know what the weight and
thickness of the digits all are quite
similar to a typical insult
when I was a kid I dreamt of having a
hoverboard
so I began experimenting with magnets
I've been working with brands and
businesses to create custom levitation
space I've been levitating shoes
skateboards speakers and even a mouse
what if we could combine magnetic
levitation with induction what if we
could set the light bulb free this is
flight
it's a levitating light it's floating
using magnets and in power through the
air so how does it work you line up the
center of the bowl
with the center of the base when you see
the light turn on you gently let go and
watch it levitate we want your flight to
last a long time so we use
energy-efficient LEDs that are safe and
don't need to be replaced we crafted the
base from a sustainable source to oak
ash and walnut oh yeah and just tap the
surface of your flight to turn it on or
off when you're not using your bulb
wireless power is good for other things
like charging your phone
safety we always think about safety the
safety of our children and of our homes
we think about the safety of all that is
important to us

hi guys my name's Sun piss on the
founder of a design company and we
produced that it will loot wheels our
suspension within the wheel so you can
fit one of our wheels to an existing
bike and you can have full suspension
so I thought the idea in 2007 and did
some sketches but since then the
designers come on and evolved
considerably luke wheels have been
developed for small compact bikes they
allow suspension where suspension can't
normally fit they like to go over bumps
easily they're low maintenance and
they're fun
