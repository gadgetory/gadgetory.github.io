facing unprecedented labor shortages in
bridge construction tying deck rebar is
a repetitive time-consuming and
physically demanding job often projects
are bid with no clear plan on where the
labor will come from which can cause
significant delays in the projects
timeline and jeopardize the project's
profitability what if there was a more
innovative way to tie rebar that
required fifty percent less workers
Thai Baht advanced construction robotics
first product is an autonomous rebar
tying robot at ACR what we're trying to
do is methodically look at the most
difficult critical path challenges in
the construction market our first
product sort of highlights that one of
our big challenges is finding people the
tide deck rebar so we focused on
developing a robot that will in fact
tide deck rebar Thai Baht ties
intersections continuously day or night
without brakes complaints or injuries
it's easy to integrate into current
operations you can transfer the Thai
Baht to the project to be a 40-foot
trailer and a large truck it only takes
a half a chef to assemble and beyond the
bridge deck
it fits bridges between 20 to 145 feet
wide
using the existing infrastructure
already on a bridge project and once
it's ready to tie it automatically
identifies the intersections hi the
intersections keep stealing that till
the job is done
it's really that simple if you want to
get your job done quicker what you can
do is put all your existing labor on to
laying and placing the rebar and then
the Thai Baht can come in and get it all
tied before the next day that will
really allow you to accelerate your
schedule in Thai Baht represents a
reliable flexible and scalable solution
to meet labor needs after the rebar is
carried in place on the deck the tying
operations only require one Operator
robot does the rest the mechanic e 12 is
the first wheeled excavator in the world
with a 100% electric power supply that
doesn't compromise on any of these three
challengers the key to autonomy and
performance lies in the fundamental
design of this machine the energy source
separated from the turret allows a
record capacity of 146 kilowatt power
offering an unrivaled autonomy of eight
hours the chosen battery technology
combines a significantly superior
lifetime to traditional batteries along
with complete safety two electric motors
provide simultaneous and independent
control of both the excavating and
driving function
the all-electric transmission offers
unmatched tractive effort at startup and
provides energy recovery when braking
the incredible power density of the
electric mortals ensures extreme
compactness and maintenance-free
operation the perfect aliens of design
and technology the McCulloch a12 paves
the way for safer cleaner and more
efficient urban construction sites
here we go
so our system is called Sam for
semi-automated Mason and it's been
developed by our company construction
robotics the Sam system is working
alongside Mason's helping them install
brick it can handle a wide variety of
bricks that are used out there in
construction primarily for veneer
commercial construction in most your
institutions or schools it's really
designed to help your commercial masonry
contractors increase their productivity
and and help reduce some of the heavy
lifting from the Mason the Mason still
works alongside Sam's they're still
responsible for setting Sam up they're
still responsible for striking the
joints and ensuring the best wall
quality and using some of the knowledge
and the skills that they have but they
don't have to have the physical demand
on their body that they might previously
that can help even some of the older
Mason's work alongside Sam and not have
to lift in place every brick and we're
successful here and we can bring
robotics and automation in the industry
if we can help construction as a whole
be more successful that's really going
to ultimately help the US economy and
even help jobs in the US we can help
provide a very interesting dynamic
aspect to the construction process where
you're using robotics and construction
at the same time and you can really help
attract young talent into the industry
NSF's been a instrumental part of our
art work it's really been what enabled
us to to go after and develop a high
risk technology like this bringing
robotics and automation into the
construction industry is a challenge on
multiple fronts one from both the
technology side but also on the business
and implementation side and I think the
ability for NSF to to come in and
support that has been really what
enabled us to be able to pursue this
technology and enter this industry
the future of construction has arrived
Caza is proud to present its vision the
Caza x1 we built the x1 to be a smart
robust and efficient solution to the
unique construction challenges of the
21st century
the x1 is the result of Silicon Valley
imagination and real-world testing a
combination of precision engineering
beauty and functionality the x1 works in
some of the toughest conditions yet it
can use up to 55% less materials to
build more resistance and unique
structures the build process is up to
70% more efficient 40% less expensive
and 100 percent more revolutionary with
the patented zero gravity arm the use of
heavy hand tools becomes almost
effortless by rendering them weightless
we decided to put the xo0g arm to the
test to see if it could save time and
money on the job site by getting the
work done faster and protecting the
worker from injury and strain we gave
the workers two identical drilling and
chipping tasks Duane will use
traditional methods while ed will be
assisted by the xo0g on we will be
monitoring the heart rate time and
progress as both workers complete the
task
the results are impressive the xo0g
enabled worker finishes all the tasks
while the other worker becomes too
exhausted in the process with the
assistance of the 0g arm the worker
completes the task faster and with
significantly less effort and fatigue so
what if you could complete your heavy
hand to a task faster with better
accuracy and less injuries now you can
with the XO Works aerial mount system
