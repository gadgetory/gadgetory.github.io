mechanism ensuring uniform clamping
pressure vices are built with
replaceable hardened steel machinist and
pipe jaws machined serrations at both
types of jaws ensure the parts are
gripped securely the Machine pipe jaws
are designed to grip pipe more
effectively the traditional

magnetic John covers for oversized
projects the vise bar can be removed and
reversed this allows the 8 Abdi to grip
parts up to 12 and a half inches wide
