we use it in every aspect of our lives
it enables us to do amazing things
but what if we could go further what if
we could go beyond the screen where your
digital world is blended with your real
world now we can this is the world with
Holograms
what will they enable us to do new ways
to visualize our work we have an idea
for the fuel tank new ways to share
ideas with each other I just put the
images in one drop more immersive ways
to play new ways to teach and learn so
put the new trap in the place of the old
one and tighten here and here new ways
to collaborate and explore the places
we've never been look at this formation
let's take a closer look
and new ways to create the things we
imagine because when you change the way
you see the world you can change the
world you see them
this is microsoft hololens the birth of
display was the beginning of a new world
in the world that was revealed by the
display we saw a brighter future
we have turned imagination into reality
we have finally opened up a new realm of
innovation for Olin
after overcoming numerous challenges
through our passion we will make this
new world with values that rise above
the technology we have known so far
display which broke away from the limits
of form more freely overcame the
hindrances of expression to expand the
value of beauty into a realm of creation
close to an art
while substituting for familiar
functions and emotions we are continuing
to imagine through infinity
a window of communication which allows
mutual understanding beyond the visible
world it always leads us to selecting
the best by swiftly reacting even at
unexpected moments the unlimited
evolution of technology turns all
imagination to a display into reality
our old dreams of getting desired
information have just all been realized
by wearable devices more satisfactory
routines are made to be enjoyed by
always providing optimum conditions
furthermore our desired values are
provided anywhere and anytime through
thinner and lighter forms
interface without gap between humans and
technology
as all the technology enters into our
environment and forms our work in life
will be made anew even further and at
the end of all the changes our dreams
will be realized although the display is
evolving ceaselessly our never changing
values will continue to be projected
toward human beings a sheet of display
will wrap around even our hearts and
contain values of communication and
healing to get us closer to fulfilling
our dreams an amazing and precious
experience where desires are unfolded
and all emotions in that space are
conveyed through the five senses
while we nourish the happiness of the
next generation in this way
we will advance to this new world
the future dreamed of by everyone the
technology that's making that future
