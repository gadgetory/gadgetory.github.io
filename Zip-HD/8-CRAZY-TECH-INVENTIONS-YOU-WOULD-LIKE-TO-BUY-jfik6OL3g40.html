drinking a lot more water and not
sleeping as well as usual why get--let's
you know that too activity levels

health indicators Waggin monitors these

surprised to learn that where dog lovers
ourselves we both suffer the loss of a
few beloved pets and after discovering
that early detection of those traumatic
illnesses could have meant the
difference between life and death we
decided that we never wanted another pet
parent to experience what we did
we decided that pets deserve the chance
to alert their parents when something's
wrong we decided to do something about
it and thus wagget was born we're living
in a world where people are taking
better care of their pets than ever so a
smart collar just made sense we think
wagget is going to completely change the
lives of dogs and their parents and now
