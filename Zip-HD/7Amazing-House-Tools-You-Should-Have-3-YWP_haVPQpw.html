the perfect solution for self-reliant
people who like to take things into
their own hands
we call it piy or plowing it yourself
and the home plow makes it fast and easy
with six models to choose from there is
a home plow that's right for you this
video will help you select the right one
before exploring what is unique to each
of the six models let's start with the
key features that are common to all home
plows
home plows are designed to fit today's
most popular SUVs or light trucks and
allow you to stay inside your vehicle
while plowing all home plows can be
attached or removed from your vehicle
without tools in less than a minute
central to the mounting system is a
class 3 2 inch receiver hitch that is
sold separately you can purchase from
local retailers or from home plow comm
to help you move snow quicker and easier
most home plows come with our patented
Auto angling feature Auto angling
automatically angles the plow left or
right when it encounters the weight of
the snow on the blade or you can lock
the blade into position with the
provided pin now let's talk about the
differences within the home plow lineup
we offer a good better best product
lineup that features two offerings
within each category in the good
category is the home plow basic home
plow basics are the least expensive
models and ship in an easy-to-manage
carton assembly should take less than an
hour using common household tools once
assembled the blade measures 18 inches
high and 6 feet eight inches wide at the
top of the blade you'll find a handle
that is used to raise or lower the blade
in addition to the manual model the
basic home plow is also available with a
wireless key fob to raise and lower the
blade moving up to the better category
you'll find the home plow on wheels this
category includes two models both with
onboard wheels that store right on the
plow the wheels make it easier to roll
the plow away for convenient storage or
remounting for added convenience both
home plows on wheels come fully
assembled the blades are four inches
taller than basic home plows which helps
clear deeper snow faster the only
difference between the two home plows on
wheels is how the blade is raised and
lowered model 24,000 uses an electric
motor with a wireless key fob
while model 25,000 uses a hydraulic
motor that can be used with
a wireless key fob or a wired controller
both home plows on wheels rely on Auto
angling for left-right blade movement if
you want the ultimate in plowing
performance then take a look at the full
power at-home plow the two models in
this category operate just like a
commercial plow this means the up down
right and left movement of the plow is
controlled by an in-cab controller that
is hardwired into the plows hydraulic
pump full powered home plows also come
fully assembled have integrated wheels
and 22 inch tall blades the only
difference between the two full powered
models is model 26 500 is 10 inches
longer at 7 and 1/2 feet thanks for
listening and this winter plow it
yourself with the home plow by Mayer the
