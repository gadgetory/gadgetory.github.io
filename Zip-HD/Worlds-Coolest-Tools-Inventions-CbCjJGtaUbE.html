required
extractor come from this poison from
snakebites wasp and bee stings mosquito
bites and more the pump acts as a vacuum
which provides the most powerful suction
available to remove venom from the body
by sucking it out the same cavity
through which it was injected there's no
need to use dangerous blades or knives
that come in less effective bite kits
Deezy extractor select the suitable
sized suction cup pull the trigger to
its full extent and place the suction
cup over the bite of the stain using
your thumb press the plunger all the way
in until you feel the suction and let
the pump remove the poison this should
take about 60 to 90 seconds for insect
bites pull the plunger out to gently
release the vacuum for snakebites center
a suction cup over one Fang all the time
and alternate between Fang holes every 2
to 3 minutes for 15 minutes discontinue
use after 15 minutes retrieving venom
can significantly improve treatment
results most snake bites occur in the
extremities like the arms lower legs or
the angle and the effectiveness of the
extractor called varies with the
location of the snake bite the extractor
pump can most effectively remove venom
that pools outside the muscle areas in
venom often pools outside the muscles
and bites to the hands feet and ankles
in large muscle areas like the calf the
venom enters the circulatory system much
quicker and the extractor pump is less
effective at removing venom in those
areas stings and insect bites leave
venom and poisons close to the skin
surface where they can easily be
retrieved best results occur when you
apply the pump quickly before fluids
enter the circulatory system barber
mosquito bites can be treated
successfully hours after the bite is
occurred we designed our 98 basic T post
