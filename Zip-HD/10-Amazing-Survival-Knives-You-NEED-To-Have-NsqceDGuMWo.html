areas based on he won't be found in many
camp kids bug out bags and tool things
weren't really bad in the world and you
could only have one knife for the rest
of your life which knife would you
choose
so founder of ultimate survival tips I
get asked that question all the time
over the years I've tested and reviewed
hundreds of knives but I never found
that one knife I could do everything I
wanted so on early 2014 I started
sketching integrating elements from
blades I loved along with features that
had never been seen before in one knife
like a micro survival kit in the handle
a two-in-one switchable nylon and Kydex
sheath that's packed with features and a
rugged knife built for tough jobs with
the finesse of a fine carving tool it's
called the MS k1 Baldy scenario knife to
build a knife like this I knew I needed
help so I teamed up with knife legend
Jeff Freeman the award-winning designer
of many iconic Gerber knives like the oh
six OTO the LMF - survival knife we
tossed around some ideas and you know he
sent me some sketches for things that he
wanted you know and we just developed it
from there we said okay well let's let's
make a product together and so he was
able to tell me the things as the
product designer of it this product
should do and I was able to come up with
solutions present them to him and he
could test him in a real world scenario
every msk one is fashioned from a single
piece of quarter-inch full-tang steel
that runs from piercing tip to rock
crushing but making it one of the
thickest most durable blades you can buy
for the msk one we chose american-made
black oxide coated d2 semis stainless
high carbon steel because it's
ridiculously tough extremely wear
resistant holds a razor-sharp edge the
center align clip point is exceptional
for piercing detailed tip carving or
precision drilling when I conceptualize
the msk one one of my major goals was to
create a knife combine the power of a
full sized chopper with the finesse and
fine cutting ability found mostly in
smaller blades we accomplished this by
raising the blade spine which
effectively shifts the center of gravity
forward just enough to make the MS k1 an
incredible chopper
while the jimp thumb ramp increases
knife control and directs thumb pressure
toward the edge making every cut precise
and efficient for more intricate cutting
and carving tasks the oversized Chow
allows you to safely grip the knife
fraction of an inch from the blade for
incredible control for handling comfort
and grip Jeff started with advanced
economic modeling software to ensure
that the MS k1 handle was shaped to
perfectly fit the human hand
we chose canvas micarta handle slabs
because of their durability natural feel
shock absorption and comfort and cold
and wet environments front and rear
guards keep your hand in place while
cutting chopping pounding smashing or
breaking things using the MS k1 stout
butt end pummel mark was this fire
symbol our curved pommel and fire steel
striker gives you maximum leverage and
the ability to generate an aim more
sparks at your tender than a straight
edge for quicker more efficient fire
starting for permit of fire generation
we've developed the first ever Center
balance stainless-steel bow drill divot
it transforms your knife into a solid
low resistance hand socket that's
reversible for right and left-handed
users with the handle slabs removed
three strategically placed lanyard holes
make it easy to add your favorite
paracord wrap or lash the msk 1/2 a
branch to make a spear I remember when I
was a kid and I got my first survival
knife with a hollow handle and a
survival kit inside I felt like Rambo
even though the knife was terrible and
the survival kit was mostly a gimmick so
my goal was to develop the first truly
useful handle survival kit including
hard to improvised items that could
actually help you stay alive in a
survival situation to do this I worked
with a team of zoo survival gear to
develop a micro survival kit for the msk
one that includes items for fire
starting water collection and
purification fishing traps and snares
navigation repairing gear and first aid</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
