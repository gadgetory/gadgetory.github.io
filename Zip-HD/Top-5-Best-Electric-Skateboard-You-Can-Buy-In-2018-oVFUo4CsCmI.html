skateboard by alters easier to ride in a
standard skateboard just plant your feet
pull the trigger and go so rechargeable
100 watt motor goes up to 10 miles per
hour and can be ridden continuously for
up to 40 minutes
squeeze the wireless controller to
accelerate push forward to break
now anyone can ride with the Phantom 1.0
electric skateboard
you
Oh
you
the model is that you used to use in
most intuitive electric skate ever
created this new emerging market
lightweight electric skates under 15
pounds is a pretty exciting new frontier
it transforms your errand on a weekend
or running to this corner store to pick
up vegetables into an activity that you
look forward to and you do all the exact
same things that you do on a traditional
longboard skateboard except now you've
got the power to go up a hill at 20
miles an hour
as fans of long boarding and electric
skates we kept having issues with the
existing boards on the market they were
heavy they looked at with their external
motors and batteries and the belt should
break down and you can't push it or ride
it like a real estate board that's why
we've created an entirely new technology
and it's called Manta drive for the
first time ever we've actually put a
motor inside the wheel of a skateboard
this is allowed us to create a powered
skateboard that feels smooth intuitive
and make the model is amazingly easy to
use yet powerful
my name is 0 7 s key I'm one of the
founder in the main engineering board he
owned iPad action sports athletes our
entire lives we actually met Mira
sponsored by the same brand
you know from speed flying to
paragliding surfing skating we love
these sports because of the feelings
that created us and that's in large part
due to the scale of the board with the
monolith in order to get the highest
performance product everything every
aspect of the design had to be done
customers the mental device technology
as the load is to get rid of the
external motor and the breakdown instead
of having a motor outside of the wheel
that turns a belt and then that belt
turns a gear in the meki returns a
wheels everything's already been
integrated inside the wheel itself so
one it looks really clean but - because
there's nothing that's binding the wheel
up once you hit your top speed you just
collide and you get that coast that's
what you get with a normal skate that's
what we wanted to create with removal of
the external thousand years we've been
able to reduce the weight significantly
to create such a for thinking product we
knew we had to beautify thinking keep a
team of action sport athletes with
engineering and product design skills to
manifest an innovative project
monolith is the only board on the market
with swappable battery packs what this
means that you essentially have a
limited range soon as you start to run
low on one battery you can swap the old
for the new so in designing and boards
reflex remote we wanted to focus mainly
on comfort and secondly on usability and
then storage but using this remote
should be completely effortless so we
took a different approach with the
remote design the reflex has a forward
facing tail this feature will give the
rider a sense of security
you can adjust or even open your hands
while riding and when you close it it'll
be right where you need it to control
the board again in keeping with imports
future for product design we've added up
Ziller USB ports onto the board you can
use this for charging remote or if
you're at the beach and you know the Sun
setting your phone just ran out of
battery you can charge your phone so you
can get that one last nap shot our
mobile app gives you complete control of
the electric skate experience it allows
you to customize your speeds
accelerations connect with other riders
and even recap on your latest session
if you're new to Electric skateboards
our beginner mode makes the model is
very easy to get going for the first
time in addition our advanced and custom
settings allow their users to realize
the full potential and power of the
board
hi I'm Lorenzo our robotic engineering
student and a commuter every day I take
the train going to my University
it takes me one and a half hour of
walking every single day really too much
time I think a lot of you are in the
same situation and we all know that
commuting is both stressful and
time-consuming
this made me think how to move more
quickly and with less effort I needed
something portable I could carry on
train and evening class for this reason
I created both there's more less and
lightest electric vehicles in the world
both is more than just an electric board
is the most portable vehicle out there
it's an amazing mean of job for powerful
lightweight easy to use as Mark has more
great revolution in the world of
mobility
all collective save time on your daily
commute and three more for your favorite
activities
there's a sub speed of 21 km/h and it's
just as fast as the bicycle
it is a range of about 10 kilometers
more than what you need for the short
daily commute in the city with a length
of 60 centimeters is the smallest
electric skateboard in the world with a
weight of 4 kilograms it's light enough
to be carried even when not in use with
no effort on your backpack for by hand
to build the balls I got help from my
father a photographer's electronics
engineer and drones maker after one year
of prototyping and testing this is the
final version the battery and
electronics are embedded in the wooden
body he has a powerful model of 2,000
watts of power and you can go uphill and
start from a full stop the inside
batteries are so powerful that can
recharge your devices on the go through
the built-in USB port you can even
record completely your iPhone up to 20
times with the remote controller writing
balls
easy just laying a video game well I see
thank you we did Italian design both is
both modern and practical and its back
is of the right size for a comfortable
and safe ending it also has the brake to
stop safety you can think bought like a
compact longboard he has a larger track
for more stability it has bigger wheels
to overcome every obstacle on the street
both is marked with bluetooth for
connectivity we are going to develop a
smart phone app and also integrate it
with wearables all as extremely low
running cost and let you save money on
fuel a complete recharge for entire year
will be less than five dollars on the
bills and when the Sun Goes Down turn on
the light and continue to scape how much
freedom can you fit in a bag
the freedom of knowledge the freedom
share freedom to dream freedom of
movement
Malik fits with linky
mobility is freedom with linky strong
patented folding mechanism it's freedom
in your bag
it's a last mile mobility solution it
means no more traffic no more bus
timetables no more foolish
linkie is the first foldable electric
skateboard the team behind linky wants
to improve the way we experience cities
wherever we were in the world we found
ourselves wanting a mode of
transportation that is keiko sustainable
easy to carry around and a really fun
derived we've applied our technical
engineering and failed background to
fill a gap in the market nothing out
there is truly portable is that why we
need blinky to fit in a bag you are
ready to go into production but we need
a minimum number of orders to make this
possible your support right now will
have keep costs down so we can guarantee
a great level of service and a truly
exciting electric longboard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
