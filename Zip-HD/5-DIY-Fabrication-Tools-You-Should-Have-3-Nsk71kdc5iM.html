warranty and product support hi I'm Sam
hi rios miller product manager with the
safety and health group today we're
introducing our newest autodarkening
helmet the c 94 series the c 94 has two
models the T 94 I with the integrated
grind field and C 94 with the external
drive button this helmet was completely
redesigned and our engineers focus on
two main things visibility and comfort
from a comfort standpoint we really
tried to shift as much of the weight
back to the back of the head as possible
we do this to try and decrease the
amount of torque on the back of your
neck for the t 94 I model we have 17
percent left torque generated on the
back of the welders neck also from a
comfort standpoint a redesigned head
gear with an increased number of comfort
pads to distribute the weight from a
visibility perspective the C 94 series
now features side windows for expanded
peripheral vision as well as the ability
to adjust here is your lens with a half
shade but most importantly the new
helmet features are clear light lens
technology clear light lens technology
enhances the colors that you see while
welding as opposed to being more of like
a green yellow tint this is more of a
true color that comes in while while
welding
additionally the light plate is a true
3.0 we're trying to have users keep
their hood down as much as possible and
our clear light lens technology helps us
accomplish that for more information on
c 94 series please visit miller welkom
the southern sawdust molt almost
developed to give you the Creator the
tools it takes to not only bring your
ideas to life but to also see them
through to production
dream to adjust reach until you're able
to make them a reality and that is what
the multi-tool is here it is
hello my name is Tyler Smith and I once
had a dream to start my own business
Southern solvent after starting my
business it didn't take me long to
realize I was going to need a CNC router
to take it to the next level I started
shopping I was new to the cnc world and
i was overwhelmed there were some cnc
router packages that were kids and
wouldn't see my business through for the
long haul there were others they were
simply too expensive for me to afford i
decided i was going to create my own
solution i needed a machine that was
durable one that could learn on one that
would allow me to prototype and also
quickly be able to move into production
for the future of my business a partner
with lori customs and over the past two
years we've been working on a router
package that is fit for all users one
that's meant for the hobbyist all the
way up to the full production shop
coupled with user friendly CAD CAM
software i'm confidence and anyone can
use the empty one to create a variety of
different products one of the most
valuable features this machine offers is
the BT 3 automatic tool changing spindle
today automatic tool change technology
has simply been inaccessible to business
startups with little investment capital
we have changed all that the MT 1 is
equipped with the most affordable
automatic tool chain system on the
market a turnkey system based on
established and proven methods that
allow you the Creator to focus on your
products so a couple of years ago we
opened a pattern drop and make mold
tools and guys with a foundry industry
and as we were working on building up
our shop we realized that there was a
whole lot of tools and items that we
needed that are difficult to find don't
even exist or if you do find them
they're really expensive so Jim being an
inventor definitely long did that we
were both yet definitely sort of
bootstrapping our way through this we
would come across things and Jim would
say well I can make it so we realize not
only did that be handy for us to have
around the shop but additionally other
people could use it that's how we ended
up drifting from a pattern shop into
more of an inventions company
I had always wished that I could have
chopped saw with a digital readout on it
and the ability to position it quickly
and easily and it was there was sitting
there looking at us all we had to do was
put it together so that's where
precision stop came from yeah so the
great part is we've been able to
actually already start using it in our
shop to help our efficiency so basically
if you were to walk up to a saw you need
a specific length you can dial in
exactly how long you want it to be the
stop moves out there and then you can
put your material out as far as it needs
to go eight measure was good the stomp
is better and the precision stomp is
faster so there are other products out
on the market that do this so our goal
was to just make it more affordable with
the same amount of accuracy we're really
thankful for all the support and help
that we've had so far it's taken a lot
of hard work and time put in to get the
infrastructure where we need it so that
we can actually take his ideas from his
head and get them to paper and then get
them actually into our hands so the
great thing is these things are up
working it's so exciting to see that and
so we know it needs to get them out to
the market out of people and actually
helping people which then kind of the
entire point of this journey we have
several different things coming out
right now and then check back to to see
what what else is come up with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
