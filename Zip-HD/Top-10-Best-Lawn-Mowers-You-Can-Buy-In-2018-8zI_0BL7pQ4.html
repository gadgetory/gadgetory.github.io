confident in a durability the next sight
deck it comes with a limited lifetime
warranty
even with all these other innovations
the moment when grass meets blade is
still the most important part of the
operation and we've got that well
covered Honda is the only manufacturer
to offer a unique twin blade mowing
design called the micro cut twin blade
system why twin blades to stack and
offset blades result in more bites into
the grass cutting the grass into smaller
pieces the leading blade makes a major
cut at the front then the lower blade
makes a smaller cut the clippings then
recirculate around inside the deck while
the blades continue to cut them into
smaller and smaller pieces smaller
clippings make better mulch because they
decompose more quickly returning
valuable nutrients to your lawn or when
bagging smaller clippings mean more
clippings per bag and list I'm emptying
the bag twin blades also produce a
superior cut giving your lawn a smooth
even service the exclusive micro cut
twin blade system is only available from
Honda

longboard technology is diversa mo for

bagged and how much is mulch there are
10 different positions ranging from full
bagging to full mulching or any
combination of the two with no tools or
attachments needed it's the ultimate in
versatility and convenience how does the
Versa mow for in one system work a
unique knob called the clip director is
built into the deck the clip director is
attached to a sliding door located under
the mowers deck which controls the
direction of the grass clippings the
clip director directs grass clippings in
10 different combinations from full
mulch to full bag or anywhere in between
in full bag mode the opening in the deck
is fully open allowing clipping standard
the bag when the clip director is moved
to the middle notches the slide door is
now partially closed so some clippings
will go into the bag and some will be
directed onto the ground when the clip
director has been moved to the full
launch position the door is completely
closed and all clippings will be
directed to the ground
when to discharge simply move the clip
director to full bag mode and remove the
bag the integrated rear discharge door
directs grass clippings to the ground
without the need for a separate
discharge chute the Honda hrx series
with its versa moe system four-in-one
allows for mulching bagging rear
discharging and leaf shredding leaf
shredding makes easy work of spring and
fall cleanup by chopping up the leaves
while mowing the hrx design makes this
task even easier

necessary just move the quick director
to notches from the full mulch position
