speak I think bears look very manly okay
okay that's my voice but it came out of
this pet speak is a revolutionary device
that makes your dog speak using recorded
messages that are triggered by your
dog's motion profile your dog can speak
I'll have that beer now
I took a walk that's bad
kind of you can record any message you
want and choose when to trigger it
through the app hey do you see that babe
over there let's send our message do you
want to get drink sometime okay
well hello there hello do you want to
get drink sometime or choose from the
audio library and let your dog's motion
profile trigger messages throughout the
day
what's squirrels OS world I haven't
gonna happen pets big even makes it
possible for you and your dog to text
you can talk to your dog remotely
they'll be home soon buddy I'll be home
soon you can even make your own funny
videos of your dog and share them with
the pet speak community pretty cool
meet buddy buddy is a fully integrated
LED dog collar packed with Wi-Fi
Bluetooth and GPS technology that's
connecting humans to their dogs like
never before because we believe dog
ownership is all about enjoying quality
time with your pet
buddy needed to be practical and easy to
use that's why buddy is completely
autonomous meaning you spend less time
playing on your phone so you can enjoy
more time with your dog but it takes
care of the rest
pet safety is paramount
that's why keeping them visible at night
is so important we give pet owners the
ability to express the unique character
using light buddy has an almost infinite
amount of beautiful lighting effects in
color combos which can be preset or
manually adjusted on the fly we've built
in some really cool innovations say
you're at work and you want to know what
your dogs up to at home buddy tracks
activity via Wi-Fi you set up an area
within the app called a geofence
and if they happen to escape or get
stolen you'll get a notification on your
phone so you can track them in real time
by GPS buddy monitors their activity
using a built-in three axis
accelerometer displayed right on the
collar how about a light sensor that
turns the collar on and off and adjusts
the brightness automatically to keep
them nice and visible
there's an ambient temperature sensor
and buddy can connect the stuff around
the home like your smart locks
thermostats and lighting set the
temperature or create zone areas around
the house set activity goals by
offsetting their food intake against
their daily exercise to get a clearer
picture of your dog's health and receive
notifications and alerts when it's time
to feed them go for a walk or take them
to the vet
buddy also lets you know when your
friends are in the area so you can meet
up the local dog park or just compare
stats when designing buddy had to look
special but it also had to function and
look like a regular collar one of the
biggest problems with existing smart
collars is a lack of a traditional
d-ring so we added one in even though
buddy is a sophisticated piece of kit it
doesn't require you to be tech savvy to
use it
that's why buddy can be operated with a
single press of a button you can scroll
through vital information at a glance
and once your preferences have been set
you never have to think about it again
just enjoy time with your buddy
I think any dog owner can relate to it
you look into their eyes and share a
brief connection and see that they
really want to understand so when you
think about trying to talk to your pet
there's really only so much you can say
but what if somehow you could
communicate more what would you ask them
first this was the inspiration of a
clever pet hoverpad is an interactive
device that rewards your dog for solving
simple puzzles we know that when you
reward an animal for performing a
certain behavior it's more likely to
perform that behavior again in the
future we use this every time we try to
get our dog to do something for a treat
and to the most important factors in
making this work a repetition and
consistency so clever pet uses your dogs
morning meal and the time it spends at
home to encourage interactions
throughout the day it starts out simple
your dog will get a treat whenever she
presses any of clever pets buttons once
she's got this down
clever fit makes her job a little bit
tougher now she only gets a treat when
she presses the button that's lit up
once she's learned that the game changes
again clever pet gradually teaches her
to interact in more interesting ways and
she stays active and happy all day long
the really great thing is that this is
all automatic clever pet engages your
dog even when you can't be home my
favorite part about working with dogs is
seeing progress on a daily basis I've
learned a lot about how dogs interact
with their surroundings and the most
important takeaway is that a dog with a
job is a happy dog what's really
interesting is that all my clients have
the same requests they all want a happy
healthy and well behaved dog so when I
was first introduced to clever pet I
learned that there was something for
these problems keeping our dogs engaged
and busy while we're not at home I've
introduced dogs to just about every
interactive toy and device on the market
and nothing challenges your dog like
clever pet does
the dog collar is a promise that you'll
always return that you'll have their
best interests at heart that you will
keep them safe healthy and loved it's
time for a color that helps you keep
that promise introducing the world's
first all-in-one smart dog collar that
seamlessly integrates and communicates
the family pet products we are dog
telogen and this is the connected collar
hi my name is Patrick rein founder of
dog telogen dogs have always been a
critical part of my life and a primary
source of happiness and fulfillment my
goal with dog telogen is to use
technology to improve the lives of dogs
and their owners Riley is my best friend
and co-pilot in life I wanted an
easy-to-use tool that would help us stay
safe healthy and connected at and away
from home like most dog owners my
biggest priority is safety that's why we
developed a proprietary virtual leash
and fence technology the notification on
your smartphone will let you know if
your dog wanders outside of the
designated zone at home and outdoors it
works by combining inaudible ultrasonic
frequencies vibrations and a simulated
leash tug to humanely keep your dog from
going any further training your dog can
sometimes be difficult so we've made it
easier than ever using our app you can
control a variety of pre-programmed and
customizable whistle tones to build
skills and deter barking easy to follow
guided training will help you cover the
basics fitness trackers empower us to
live healthier lives and now they can do
the same for our furry friends using the
app owners can set goals view highlights
share progress and receive suggestions
to build healthier habits your dog can
get lost sometimes but that doesn't mean
you have to gps partnered with two-way
communication and smart leds give you
the ability to track speak to and keep
your buddy safe no matter where you are
Riley sit stay good boy
this is more than a nap it's a gateway
to helping your dog live a longer and
healthier life dog telogen sends
automatic reminders to keep you up to
date on vaccinations allowing you to
easily share health records with any bed
in order to have all of this
functionality and style and one
integrated device we designed it from
the ground up by combining and
customizing the same technology seen on
smartphones and tech wearables we have
created an intelligent collar unlike
anything on the market all this power is
housed in a sleek waterproof rugged
flexible and customizable body with a
battery that will last up to 14 days
removal and recharging is made easy due
to our buckle is magnetic latching
system and conductive charging the
connected collar is the key to unlock in
a future family of pet products to
communicate and interact with each other
we brought the dream of a truly
integrated and stylish smart dog collar
to reality now we need your help to
bring this exciting new product to
market please take a look at a reward to
see how you can get involved together we
can use technology to make life safer

fetch he can I did this is my grandson
grant we've been working out I fetch for
nearly three years it's an interactive
on-demand
playmate for your pet our dog Prancer
always wants to play fetch so we set out
to build something I would play with
them and we couldn't we designed I fetch
for indoor use the miniature tennis ball
it launches is perfect for small and
medium dogs who often require a lot of
exercise I fetch only powers up after
balls dropped in the final saving energy
and staying quiet with not in use some
dogs can be trained to play with I fetch
on their own while others require a
little bit more help I fetch doesn't
necessarily replace humans role in
playtime it adds a whole new element of
fun this toy puts a smile on the face of
everyone who sees it next
