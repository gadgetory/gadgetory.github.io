will allow you to control the most
anything you just need to wear the ring
and tap on the side to start your
gesture ring captures and analyzes your
gesture inside of it it sends the data
to your smart devices vibration and led
notifies you of status updates and
notifications each application has its
own unique gesture mark so when you want
to use it simply perform the designated
action gesture marks can also be edited
making customization simple and easy to
control home appliances simply sync ring
to them using your smart devices you can
connect directly or by using the hub
when designing ring we had to start from
scratch we made numerous prototypes and
each time we got smaller while as
functionality improved capturing and
analyzing the fingers movement was also
a challenging task in 2013 our gesture
recognition technology was still in its
early stages however by 2014 it has been
nearly perfected and has even precise
enough to detect letters now you can
type text midair anywhere anytime we
also provide ring font than making
typing quick and easy another unique
feature of ring this is advanced payment
solution gateway when used with GPS or
ibeacon ring allows you to immediately
make payment transactions
revolutionising the way you shop we will
also open API so developers can make
original applications and publish in the
ring store the ring store allows you to
search for and install many applications
we've already tested and confirmed that
ring works with numerous hardware smart
devices and web services
all around the world technology is
booming but your car has been stuck in
the dark ages the last unconnected part
of your life

Halas is a tabletop holographic display
that enhances your life and invites
connection it is a central place to sink
any type of device and to display its
content from all sides you can play
games of family connect across
generations work together cooperatively
or compete head-to-head make education
and engaging experience and even connect
over voice chat to create a holographic
teleconference call for something so
natural as sharing and displaying we
wanted to make something with as many
viewing angles as possible to get to
where we are today we iterated hundreds
of times we settled on a design that's
beautiful strong and safe it has an eco
friendly monitored and it's tempered
glass has a coating that is specially
designed to reflect a specific amount of
light for optimal display quality USB
and HDMI ports allow devices to connect
and display on the house from Joshua's
controls like leap motion the brain
sensors and a 3d printer we have tested
them all with the Hollis and are adding
more connection options to make the
Hollis more natural and intuitive to
interact with making the Hollis combined
with lots of different software and
hardware makes it even more complex
that's why we have assembled the best
team possible to do just that and are
encouraging more great programmers to
develop content for the holes once it is
released we have unreal and unity SDKs
available and are adding more middleware
support in the future
you've got the hottest new computer but
now you can't plug in any of your stuff
your new MacBook shouldn't make the rest
of your Hardware obsolete and some
things just can't be connected via the
cloud introducing hub plus connect all
your devices to the new macbook hub plus

sleeping using its EEG sensors it then
uses this information to adjust your
audio as you fall asleep this ensures
your audio doesn't wake you and is
better tuned to block out external
disturbances we realize that to ensure
we had a quality product we would need
truly world-class audio cocoons

you
at Doppler labs we want to give you full
control over how you hear the world
that's why we've created here two
digital buds in an app that allows you
to personalize your live audio
environment we consider here to be the
first true here
wearable technology designed
specifically for your ears the Doppler
vision is to get the user control over
their immersive environment and we
provide tools such that you can combine
different features different
functionality to create a unique
experience just for you the main
functions of here are volume knob on the
world live EQ and effects it's
essentially putting a studio in your
ears so you can live curate the audio
you hear so you have the perfect audio
experience for you every single time
being able to process and control
real-time environment is amazing
nobody's doing it so design is really
important for this product we're
essentially taking something that is
extremely complex but we're trying to
make it into something that's very very
simple to use
so we start by you know looking at
people understanding their motives and
there are problems and what's important
to them and we try to design products
that that work for them so in order to
do that we id8 we evaluate we make
mock-ups we work very closely with our
engineering team in California to make
sure that we you know make something
that not only looks good but that works
well we've all found ourselves in audio
experiences where you can't hear the
singer where you can't hear the bass
where the guy behind the booth has
decided that he's going to throw a lot
of reverb on that sound and it actually
completely changes the way you hear the
music you've gone and paid to see with
here we want to actually give you that
control back the sound comes in and we
run it through a processor a thing
called a codec which is audio active
noise cancellation it processes the
signal shapes it turns around and plays
it right back into your ear and we
literally have 30 millions of a second
to do that so with here we're giving you
the ability
to have full control over your audio
environment but once we have a speaker
mic and computer in your ears the
possibilities of what we can do with
audio are endless
