world a few smart people too and this
smart person looked at this dumb thing
and said I can make this dumb thing
smart now why in the world would I want
this dumb thing to be smart because the
easy part is the online ordering the
dumb part is the tracking waiting
stressing planning to be standing by my
front door during the all-day delivery
window where the carrier guarantees to
show up while I'm in the shower
ring the doorbell once drop off a
misdelivery note because who would want
to leave something on this front porch
it's a real pain in my Pony Express it's
high time someone made the thing that
was invented 100 years ago
smart this is you Sela it's more than a
mailbox for letters
it's a mailbox robot that can see when a
package gets dropped off and sends me a
notification through the app yes there's
an app and yes it's smart even if you're
nothing like me you're probably a
one-click purchaser on the Internet just
like me so this thing will transform
itself to fit just about any box so I
can order more stuff
you can always return it
speaking of returning I can put stuff in
there as well and you sellable up the
carrier know that it's ready to be
picked up it's also got other useful
features like a microphone for voice
messages and security features like a
couple of cameras and one-time-use
access codes all of which I managed
through the app plus package tracking
online order management and easy access
to retailer support the apps great I
just didn't like that phone you sella is
like my own teeny tiny little post
office right there by my front door but
you Sela is not a toy it's not an excuse
to have yet another connected device
it's a responsible way to protect and
manage the things that are meant just
for me the things that often get left
out for people who aren't me
for the last seven years we've been
creating bike strollers that are loved
and enjoyed all around the globe this is
our latest project and we do not
hesitate when we say this is the next
step in the evolution of family bikes
see three years ago we searched for our
next project we turn to a lot of people
and ask them what they would want in a
family bike some answers were strange
you make it fly somewhere eye-opening
young babies should be facing their
parents and some were just adorable we
listened and set out to create the
ultimate family bike for two years we
made sketches prototypes study materials
carried out experiments and explored
every aspect of family bike should
happen basically we reinvented the
family bike this is the taiga 2.0 the
most comfortable safe easy to ride
practical and just all-around coolest
family like you could possibly imagine
the targa 2 has everything our customers
wanted and much more
safety first Tonga has three wheels so
it's inherently stable the cargo box
materials are super strong plastics with
a metal frame inside that makes the
seating area durable and resistant to
impact the child seats themselves have
endless features and options Tonga
can take one or two kids facing forwards
backwards or facing each other or a
boatload of laps to keep it versatile in
seconds taka two turns from a family
bike into a lockable cargo bike with
extra load space on top we use disc
brakes and the Shimano gear and you can
always easily turn it into an electric
bike for effortless long distance rides
now for the fun part apart from the wind
in their hair we wanted the kids to have
a truly enjoyable adventure on our bikes
so we added the accessory bar to which
you can attach a variety of fun add-ons
yes there's also a water gun
and when it rains or if the kids just
want some privacy
there's the royal canopy let's see what
else no it can't fly yet but it can all
be taken apart to fit in your car truck
oh and the seats come in a variety of
colors because you know the personal
touch transforms our own ultimate bike
into your own
everyone loves outdoor activities but
with all that fun comes all that cleanup
that's why I created the rinse kit it's
like having a hose to go my name is
Chris Crawford and after countless hours
of developing I've created something
that is truly revolutionary rinse kit is
super easy to use to fill it simply
attach the Quick Connect adapter to any
sink or hose bib turn on the water it
will fill in 30 seconds attach the
nozzle and it's ready to go
there's no pumping or batteries required
it uses no moving parts and it will hold
the water pressure for months ok so
right now you're probably asking
yourself how in the heck does this thing
work inside the rinse kit there's a
sealed chamber when you connect it to a
hose bib the water pressure from your
home simply compresses the air in the
chamber the best part about this design
is that it essentially uses the air as a
spring there's nothing to wear out we
specifically designed the rinse kit to
be easy to carry and travel with it
holds 2 gallons of water which will
spray for over five minutes on the
center setting and for over 30 minutes
on the mist setting the lid detaches so
you can clean up and change on it you
can also use it as a cutting board or to
sit on as you rinse off your feet
rinse kit is bpa-free so it's safe to
drink out of
and it's extremely durable you really
can't hurt this thing
introducing the bio light based Lantern
the world's first flat-pack lantern that
creates your own personal smart grid
completely off grid hi
I'm Anton and I'm Mike and we're the
lead designers on the base Lantern when
you're away from an outlet lighting
large spaces generally means turning to
some form of lantern to get the job done
and it turns out most lanterns out there
could really use an upgrade
with that in mind we designed the base
Lantern to meet three core energy needs
big light without any bulk shareable
power so you choose what gets a charge
and smarter control giving you real-time
feedback on how to make your energy last
longer here's a closer look at the base
Lantern in action utilizing advanced
edge light technology the base Lantern
maximizes brightness while minimizing
space fitting 500 lumens of light into a
compact packable form and unlike old
single function lanterns as a hub this
can extend even more light with the
integration of bio light site lights
creating easy overhead lighting to light
large spaces or create multiple websites
with the use of phones and other digital
tools playing more and more of a role in
off-grid life we need energy to keep
them going the base lanterns internal
rechargeable battery is paired with two
USB ports so you can power your weekend
with up to 50 hours of light or for
phone charges depending on what you need
grab the base Lantern XL and add even
more power to your system when energy is
scarce making it easy to monitor and
adjust your usage is critical so we're
bringing the controls and analytics
right to your pocket turn on/off and dim
and if you've got site lights hooked up
you can control those to full color
spectrum control allows you to engage
night vision calibrate the warmth of
your light or even have a little fun
with your surroundings set sleep timers
or alarms to wrap up your night or start
an early day without fumbling in the
dark enable proximity activation and the
base Lantern will automatically turn
itself on or off based on your location
so you can find your way back home
safely and easily oh and the app itself
it barely uses any battery from your
phone thanks to low-energy Bluetooth

imagine adding an electric wheel to your
button travel point in 250 miles on a
single charge at all when you want said
back when you don't he'll no sweat it's
500 watts of power available at the
press of a lever easy to install and
intuitive to operate designed in
Cambridge Massachusetts and built in New
England
two years ago I was watching Tron
thinking about all that empty space
inside the orbital wheel really kept me
up at night why don't we put a motor
when we put a battery in that space I
managed to make a mini prototype but I
basically have two left thumb and a
limited knowledge of engineering 18
months ago I was working as a propulsion
development engineer at SpaceX when I
met Mike installed the gyah orbital
wheel prototype I loved the concept and
one of the he'll make it a reality
since then we've created five
generations of prototype given hundreds
of test rides and logged thousands of
miles from all that user feedback we've
integrated all sorts of features into
the wheel installation takes only 60
seconds and requires no tools the
battery is easily removable even the
tire is a made of high-density foam they
ride just like a normal tire but they'll
never go flat the motor will take you
zero to 20 miles an hour in six seconds
the feature set goes on and on we've
only just got rolling
introducing the biggest breakthrough in
Wi-Fi in 15 years with access to triple
the spectrum enabling up to 300 times
faster performance than the typical
consumer router 10 state-of-the-art
internal radios active my mobi informing
and nine powerful antennas for amazing
range in coverage all without
compromising design and style portal is
we believe the fastest strongest Wi-Fi
able to adapt to changing environments
able to adapt to congestion and traffic
something that you've never had to
manage because it was smart enough to
manage itself you'll get faster Wi-Fi no
matter what the condition is
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
