minute over a million every year and
that's just what's reported that's why
we're so excited to bring you linka the
world's first Auto unlocking smart bike
lock linka can do a lot of cool things
but at its core it's a powerful lock
that's hard mounted to your frame so
you're always ready when you're ready to
lock up just tap the button and a
hardened steel ring slides into place
making it impossible to ride away so now
that your bikes locked if someone tries
picking it up linka has a built-in
accelerometer that automatically
triggers our siren stopping the thief in
their tracks while simultaneously
sending a tamper alert directly to your
phone so you know what's up now what
makes linka a smart lock is its ability
to recognize who you are and
automatically unlock as you approach of
course you can always unlock it with
your smart phone or for phoneless access
you can press your four-digit passcode
so if you want to lock your bike to
something add on a link a chain and just
lock up to an existing bike rack if you
already have a chain or you lock then
you're all set
inside linka is a really powerful
battery you can get up to one whole year
before your next charge and the link app
notifies you when your battery's low so
you never really have to think about it
so about the app not only does it auto
unlock lenka send tamper alerts and
track battery usage we're really excited
to introduce our theft indicator map the
app tracks reported stolen bikes in your
area and warns you of dangerous
locations we'll even recommend a safer
place to park
this is John like 63% of all bicycle
users John had his bicycle stolen and it
keeps happening not again bicycle locks
today are really old-fashioned they're
heavy
poorly designed and have terrible value
for money imagine John can take out his
smartphone and locate his bicycle while
the thief is on the run we have invented
the first GPS tracked siren alarmed
sensor enabled by some a lot best of all
there's no key it is fully
remote-controlled with your smartphone
so how does it work with lock aid John
can secure his bicycle easily with a
swipe of his finger on the app or he can
simply walk away to activate the alarm
with or without the cable now John's
bike is safe when a thief tries to
tamper with the lock it will trigger a
painfully loud alarm since the cable is
wider and you immediately receive a push
notification on your mobile phone which
allows you to react quickly if he
attempts to hammer it off or if he uses
a saw the vibration sensor will also
trigger the alarm
freezing lock aid or attempting to melt
it will be useless since the device also
has a thermometer which will trigger the
alarm in case of an abrupt change in
temperature with the community alarm
feature you can add other people so that
they also received a push notification
in case you're away you can locate share
borrow and lend bikes with locking you
can send electronic key to your friends
on Facebook and allow them to use your
bike anywhere anytime
and no key we thought the lock industry
could use a little shaking up so we
created the no keypad lock the world's
first smart padlock no key is won
numerous awards and has been recognized
as a game-changing innovation however
some people need an extra level of
protection so we created the no key you
lock incorporating all the cutting-edge
technology used in the original no key
into a practically indestructible
hardened steel body the no key you lock
will protect your bicycle or motorbike
in the toughest environments while also
giving you easy access using only your
smartphone available with an app for iOS
Android and Windows phones the Nokia
lock uses wireless Bluetooth technology
when clicked it automatically looks for
a phone with a compatible key and
unlocks you don't even need to remove
your phone from your pocket or purse
just click and go no more worrying about
lost keys or forgotten combinations
sharing your bike with others is easy
with just a couple taps you can quickly
and securely share your bike with your
friends even better you can revoke
access automatically without needing to
track down keys the Nokia lock
incorporates a long-life rechargeable
battery that will last several years
between charges but we wanted the no key
you love to do even more so we added an
alarm after locking no key hold down the
button to arm the alarm function if soin
tampers with your no key for more than
three seconds a loud alarm will shriek
for 30 seconds drawing attention and
likely scaring off the intruder the
alarm function resets every time you
open no key the history function in the
app shows you who when and where no key
was used what if your phone dies or is
lost not a problem just key in your
custom quick click code this ensures
that you'll never be left stranded in
the unlikely event that you ignore the
warning in the app and let your battery
die you can always give Nokia a jump
start with an external battery finally
maybe you don't have a smartphone or
prefer to bike without it we've got you
covered just add the optional key fob to
your order and you'll be able to access
no key with or without your smartphone

bike it uses always-on bluetooth LE to
connect to your phone so you can lock

panel its battery never runs out
ordinarily I wouldn't leave my bike
unattended for even an hour but sky lock
isn't ordinary it is a built-in
anti-theft feature
I just log sky lock into my local Wi-Fi
network and it sends me an alert if
anything or anyone disturbs my bike sky
lock uses its built-in accelerometer to
monitor all movement when you're not
around and you can adjust the
sensitivity to make sure there's an
actual threat you don't even need to tap
a button to unlock set lock you can set
