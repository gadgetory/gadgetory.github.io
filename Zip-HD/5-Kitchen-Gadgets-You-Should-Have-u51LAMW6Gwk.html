I went to
box of Girl Scout cookies Samoas are
they're really good and daddy takes a
nap Bala eat as much candy as I can
once I was watching a movie and at the
end I realized I ate a whole pint of ice
cream I love hot cheeto I love bacon I
love hot cheetos once 850 pieces of
bacon in a single day I'm obsessed with
hot cheetos I can't stop eating hot
cheetos help me I'm excited to introduce
you to the kitchen safe a fun and easy
way to control temptation the kitchen
safe is atomic container that puts you
in control let me show you how it works
first place an item in the container
next rotate the dial to set the timer
and finally press the dial to activate
the alarm once the container is locked
it cannot be opened until the timer
reaches zero it's that easy I came up
with the idea of the kitchen safe while
completing my graduate studies I was
looking for something fun and easy to
use and help me with my food cravings
lose a little weight and live a
healthier lifestyle all while still
being able to enjoy the occasional snack
as a trained chef I take pride in all
the kitchen products alive I don't have
patience with bad products we all know
there's a lot of bad products especially
Pizza cutters out there they flex they
wobble and they tear all the toppings of
your pizza fridge they just don't cut
people not anymore
the hubless pizza cutter has a smaller
than average cutting wheel yet it cuts
far deeper than any other pizza cutter
other our patent-pending slip ring
design reduces drag and eliminates
excess blade level and it's made using
the best materials available the design
has been awarded the global innovation
area the 2015 international home and
house workshop we already cut most of
the tools needed and I've done a small
pilot run these first hand finished and
tested Pizza cutters are ready to be
shipped through our early bird backers
Kickstarter we're almost there and we
need your help
generating enough free orders to cut the
last tool needed to enter full-scale
manufacturing please share this campaign
with your friends and family and take
advantage of some of the great rewards
we have to offer below help us save the
world one pizza at a time edge on the
right and a happy cooked</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
