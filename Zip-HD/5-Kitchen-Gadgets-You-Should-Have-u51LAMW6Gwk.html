I went to
box of Girl Scout cookies Samoas are
they're really good and daddy takes a
nap Bala eat as much candy as I can
once I was watching a movie and at the
end I realized I ate a whole pint of ice
cream I love hot cheeto I love bacon I
love hot cheetos once 850 pieces of
bacon in a single day I'm obsessed with
hot cheetos I can't stop eating hot
cheetos help me I'm excited to introduce
you to the kitchen safe a fun and easy
way to control temptation the kitchen
safe is atomic container that puts you
in control let me show you how it works
first place an item in the container
next rotate the dial to set the timer
and finally press the dial to activate
the alarm once the container is locked
it cannot be opened until the timer
reaches zero it's that easy I came up
with the idea of the kitchen safe while
completing my graduate studies I was
looking for something fun and easy to
use and help me with my food cravings
lose a little weight and live a
healthier lifestyle all while still
being able to enjoy the occasional snack
as a trained chef I take pride in all
the kitchen products alive I don't have
patience with bad products we all know
there's a lot of bad products especially
