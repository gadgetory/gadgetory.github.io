first super tough super fast Bluetooth
controlled carbon fiber drone the carbon
flyer is the ultimate tech toy we've
created a revolutionary plane using
actual carbon fiber we've equipped a
carbon flyer with twin high output modes
--is a long-range Bluetooth control
module LED running lights and an onboard
camera
carbon fibers ten times stronger than
aluminum it has 100 times the strength
to weight ratio of steel and it is more
than a thousand times stronger than the
toughest phone this prototype right here
impacted the site of buildings and
concrete surfaces over a dozen times at
high speed
the carbon flyer can be controlled up to
240 feet away using either an Android or
Apple smartphone bluetooth allows for a
two-way communication to complain
providing real-time battery and
connectivity steps our interactive app
allows the pilot to control the plane's
airspeed altitude and steering using
only one hand
I'm Derek I'm passionate about drones
and I've met many people wanna fly
drones but found them really hard to
control I want to help because I feel
that they're missing out to the fun of
arrow filming that's why we came out
with the idea of ghost this is a
traditional remote controller it has
many switches and knobs which can be
very hard to master one bad news and a
mistake can be very expensive
most of the joints also require assembly
but not everyone has a time or skills to
do that
Ghost comes preassembled and is ready to
fly right out of the box our app makes
it super easy to pilot simply tap unlock
then take off and ghost will rise and
hover now tap a spot on the map and
ghost will fly there immediately to get
it back just hit return and ghost will
take the shortest route back to its
takeoff point press lamp and ghost will
descend and land gently for advanced
control tap hover to make ghost hold the
current spot and enter the micro control
mode
here you can adjust ghosts direction
speed camera angles and more not only is
ghosts user-friendly it's designed with
quality parts and as great features and
performance what's really cool about the
ghost though is it's customized ability
with respective of hardware and software
one project that I'm working on is
mounting this RP lidar unit from the low
peak on the ghost row giving it the
ability to sense its surroundings with
the data from the wide art the ghost
will be able to detect obstacles like
trees and buildings and adjust its
flight path is necessary I'm also really
looking forward to developing the ghost
SDK which includes libraries for both
Java and c-sharp I also see some awesome
integration possibilities for input
devices like leap motion bio and my own
device
seemi is different from anything on the
market right now in the sense that it
solves the problem of how you control
the entire flying movie and image
capture process from a single device
what it does is make flying easier by
bringing automation of those systems
inside of the flyer and allows you to
concentrate on where you want the
vehicle to be the images and video you
want to capture then to be able to
rapidly share it with your friends
when is Mark Richardson I'm in charge of
Poli hula which is a group of great
engineers and enthusiasts building
drones for people to take photographs of
themselves in the environment and just
generally have fun with
I'm a former planetary scientist and I
was involved with NASA in exploration of
the solar system what's really exciting
about Paula Hilo is the opportunity to
bring a lot of those technologies that
we used and getting vehicles to land on
Mars and to Alban around Venus and use
those to make personal fliers easier to
use
seemi is the first networked camera
drone you control seamlessly from a
single mobile app Cimiez 1080p HD camera
is housed inside of simi extending down
from the flyer at takeoff and retracting
when it lands
seemi is a lightweight compact and
portable drum you can take it anywhere
in a traditional camera bag
Cimiez legs detach easily for travel and
storage part replacement and for future
component upgrades
seemi has multiple flight modes
including orbit pano follow and manual
control simi can orbit clockwise or
counter clockwise around you in panel
mode simi will remain in a fixed
position while turning and capturing
amazing panoramic shots for follow mode
shots simi includes an attachable water
and sweat proof tracking device this
rugged GPS tracker enables you to put
your mobile device down and focus
completely on your tasks and follow mode
simi will adjust to your position as
well as to increases and decreases in
speed so you don't even have to think
about see me
when flying see me manually you can
select where you want the flyer to go
next
just enter your chosen destination and
see me will takeoff and wait there for
you and your aerial video and photos
will be completely stable because Cimiez
in-house camera unit is controlled on a
unique 2 axis micro gimbal which
automatically adjusts itself at every
turn so the Shema car is a flight
control computer at the hata of CB it's
a powerful little computer that takes
care of all the flight control
algorithms figuring out how to keep the
vehicle stable its ability to understand
where up and down is but it's moving
strongly in one direction and it plugs
into the GPS system allowing for a full
navigation solution while in flight simi
allows you to live feed videos straight
to your mobile device then you can
instantly upload your videos and images
to any social media platform with an
open API you can share your video and
grow your social following
before simi touches down
what do you think it takes to get
high-quality drone footage like this a
professional drone operator a cameraman
expensive equipment or simply this
introducing the sci-fi level one drone a
drone that lets absolutely anyone
capture footage like never before
Syfy's level up technology is the real
breakthrough by using six rotors the
drone can fly without tilting making it
simple and intuitive enough for anyone
to fly plus you get professional stable
footage without an exposed gimbal
because level up gets rid of the usual
multi rotor wild tilting with the
interface can be simplified to fly just
swipe swiping is a superior interface
that allows you to see what you're
capturing while flying
unlike tilting or joystick only
navigation our flying interface can be
downloaded as an app on your smartphone
it's simple accurate and fun because
drone flying is better when it's shared
the level one can post shots and video
real-time to your social network of
choice and with the new geofence
technology you can define the area in
which you want to fly your drone will
stay within your boundaries of choice
allowing everyone from beginners to
experts to practice their piloting
skills with confidence so far sci-fi
Works has been building drones for
industrial application but we want to
bring our drone inventions to everyone
at consumer friendly prices
plus we just love robots so really we
put our full technological expertise
into designing and drone through the
consumer that gives professional video
quality and stability but doesn't
require a professional knowledge to fly
our drone will come with a 1080p high
quality camera and it will be ready out
of the box for everything from and
videos to action filming thanks to the
sci-fi level ones capabilities instead
of worrying about the drone itself you
can focus on the experience the sci-fi
level one is simple to fly captures
exactly what you want and shares it in
real time this is the first drone for
absolutely everyone from the drone
company side by
we're really excited to introduce the
plexidrone we have thought about the
things that people don't really think
about how do you improve drone
technology how do you make it accessible
to everyone how do you inspire people to
create using drone technology a treaty
robotics we believe technology should be
building bridges towards new levels of
creativity and productivity rather than
barriers and the Flexi drove is one of
those technologies a drone that you can
snap together and take apart in less
than one minute and when you're done you
just put it into your hardshell backpack
and take it anywhere that you want to go
the plexi pack is something we designed
in order to carry everything you need to
capture all the great shots that you
want and carry it with you everywhere
you go
anywhere you can go with the backpack
you can take the plexidrone with the
plexi drone you can carry more than just
a camera with very simple payload clips
are able to just snap on whatever it is
that you want to put on there it's so
simple
another unique feature about the
plexidrone is that it has a retractable
landing gear you will no longer have any
kind of junk in your shot you never have
to crop anything out at the bottom it's
just gonna be clear beautiful 360 view
on the plexi drone GPS follow me is an
amazing feature all that you do is press
follow me on your mobile device on your
phone or your tablet and it's as easy as
that
it's gonna be very very easy to use
everybody has a smartphone now great now
you just saved yourself eight hundred
bucks for a controller aside from that
you're also able to control more than
one of them at the same time you will
definitely find no drones that you can
control using our swarm technology it's
completely new something you won't find
anywhere else that means that you're
able to view the same scene from
multiple vantage points you get the same
shot with one user but many drones our
drone is equipped with an ultrasonic
sensor at the front of it it'll flash
its lights and give you an audio message
to let you know that you're getting in
this pack you don't have to interpret
blinking LED lights because it tells you
and it's own voice the initial
the sequence completed are you even
going to use me plexidrone is going to
unleash new dimensions of creativity and
productivity and take your camera to
places that you never thought were
possible
