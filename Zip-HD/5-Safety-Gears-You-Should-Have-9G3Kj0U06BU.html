line all shells offer the same level of
mechanical protection for impacts for
falling objects the choice of model
depends on the specific hazards the user

vent are designed for work at height and

risk of the helmet coming off during a

fall arrestor z' for ropes consists of
two products the ASAP for fall
protection and the ASAP lock for
difficult access they are both designed
to provide continuous fall protection
and are easy to use
in the event of a sudden movement due to
a fall a slick on uncontrolled descent
the fall arrestor locks on the rope
stopping the user
the key to the systems lies in a unique
working principle at moderate speeds the
device moves back and forth freely in
both directions a sudden downward
movement accelerates the locking wheels
rotation central force activates
internal weights that stop this rotation
the arm pivots on its access and the
device locks by pinching the rope
between the locking wheel and the frame
of the device this locking concept based
on the rotational speed of the locking
wheel works in every potential situation
encountered at a worksite whether moving
up or down or with the Rope running
vertically or diagonally in a fall the
users natural reaction is often to grab
the device with both hands the ASAP and
ASAP lock ensure that the worker is
protected even in this type of situation
the ASAP fall arrestor z' follow users
wherever they go without requiring any
manual operation thus users always have
both hands-free in order to fully
concentrate on the task at hand
the device can be placed anywhere on the
rope
the ASEP sauber energy absorbing lanyard
allows the user to keep the rope clear
of the workspace this protects the rope
from hazards such as sharp tools or
molten metal spray
two lengths are available in order to
choose the ideal balance between
distance from the rope and fall distance
the ESOP line of mobile fall arrestor x'
consists of two products the ASAP
offering fall protection for workers at
height such as carpenters roofers or
tower workers and the ASAP lock designed
for difficult access work which offers
two additional functions first it
includes a locking system that reduces
fall distance by immobilizing the device
on the rope in case of high winds this
function also keeps the rope from being
pulled upwards second the ASAP lock was
designed to optimize passing an anchor
its attachment system makes it drop
proof and simplifies rope installation
and removal ASAP and ASAP lock your
constant bodyguard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
