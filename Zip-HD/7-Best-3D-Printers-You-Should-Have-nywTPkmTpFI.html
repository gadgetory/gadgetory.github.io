bunny and the octopus and I printed all
by myself
kids today are becoming empowered by
bringing their imagination to life
the excitement is motivating kids to
work together to be creative and to not
be afraid of mistakes finally we have an
educational tool that can be used almost
anywhere and the best part is kids love
it
hi I'm Nicole I'm an arts teacher I'm
happy to introduce mini toy it's the
world's first kid friendly 3d printer
it's cute it's safe and it's excellent
for the learning experience of children
and it's very affordable the mini toy
app has hundreds of different 3d models
so it's easy for your kids to find the
object they want to print creating and
learning has never been this fun I love
the design of the 3d printer the fact
that the mechanical parts are hidden
makes it really kid-friendly the
different materials like soft PLA and
the flexi place offers a variety of
textures making the learning experience
a lot more dynamic we also made sure
that printing is easy with OneTouch
printing we've been developing the
prototype for more than one year with
our team of dedicated engineers we were
able to accumulate two registered
patents and ten patent-pending
technology to build the safest and first
ever kid-friendly desktop 3d printer
it's pretty cool because you can make
many things it with it and by many I
mean almost everything parents
everywhere can feel better knowing that
their child can understand and use this
technology that's already changing the
world
what do we expect from a 3d printed
object a plastic part a little rough
around the edges visible layer lines in
the surface that's the nature of
extrusion based technology and what sets
apart a treaty printed object from a
mass-produced plastic part but little
refinement but what if you could easily
eliminate the layers and smooth the
surface of your printed part achieving a
high-gloss finish without a moment of
elbow grease we are private introduced
our most innovative filament to date and
our brand new desktop machine to work in
tandem available in a wide variety of
colors this new filament has a vast
range of applications across many
different industries poly smooth is
soluble in isopropyl alcohol when a poly
smooth model is placed into the polisher
an ultrasonic nebulizer creates a fine
mist in the chamber each particle of
mist is typically 5 to 10 microns in
diameter so a very even coat of IPA is
applied to every nook and cranny of your
model the particles then start melting
the surface of the model smoothing the
layers and your model is transformed in
a matter of minute
you can use poly smooth on any desktop
3d printer like all other poly maker
filaments poly smooth is easy to work
with and prints very well you can get
fine details with good interlayer
adhesion print complex geometries with
poly smooth impressive bridging
capability poly smooth support is also
very easy to remove and once polished
there is no scar left on the surface
throughout the whole process of bringing
our first Hardware product to market
we utilize 3d printing focusing firstly
on function over form we fine-tuned our
early prototypes to get the best user
experience at the desktop machine until
finally our designers could bring the
polisher to life with our minimal design
and intuitive interface I use an awful
lot of different 3d printing materials
in my business and I'm loving poly
smooth not only for its amazing polish
ability but for its great printing
characteristics it's just a joy to print
with and I'm sure that you're going to
like it too
we designed the polisher be a simple and
intuitive as possible
to operate the publisher just twist the
dial set the time alongside the main
operating dial the polisher features
three buttons or power opening and
closing and the chamber lighting we've
built in some really cool lighting
effects into the polisher
there's dimmable white chamber lights
that illuminate your model there's also
a multicolored never laser light which
can cycle through 15 colors or you can
set it to your preferred illumination
just
what if you could with a few clicks of
your mouse 3d print a toy for your child
in the comforts of your own home what if
you could create gifts for your friends
and minutes introducing the 101 hero
mini 3d printer the most affordable 3d
printer in the world we've worked with
the best in the industry
to ensure a compact and easy to use
design simply turn it on insert a memory
card and print anything imaginable the
beauty of the 101 hero mini is in its
simplicity all you have to do is
download one of thousands of lab tested
g-code files from our website save it to
your SD card and make it real with one
touch we think that everyone should have
access to 3d printing technology and
it's for this reason that we've made the
101 hero mini the most affordable way to
3d print the hero mini uses a new
technology to drive the plastic
extruding motor and we've come up with
many innovations in the structure and
design of the printer itself
with these adaptations you're able to
have the same functionality of a
high-end 3d printer but for a fraction
of the cost
meanwhile we've also worked hard to
ensure a safe design so the 101 hero
mini can be enjoyed by the young and old
alike the 101 hero mini represents an
entirely new medium for kids engineers
artists and makers

3d printing is great but often
unaccessible until now 3d printers have
cost over a thousand dollars and extra
just for the most basic versions at
anvil we've set out to change all of
this
our 3d printer is easy to use and at a
$299 price point it's affordable enough
that any family can own it but most
importantly the print quality is
incredible we've sought out to provide
the best user experience of any 3d
printer unlike other tricky and hard to
use 3d printers anvil is ridiculously
user friendly for example it's
incredibly easy to load no more
complicated and inconvenient insertion
processes like traditional 3d printers
even better all you need to do to
operate anvil is press a single button
we've designed our printer with an
enclosed compartment so you're protected
from any heat related injuries we've
designed every feature with you in mind
so that you can create anything you can
imagine without any training or previous
knowledge of 3d printing our printer
allows you to design anything using our
app we've built the software to look
like Legos you put your design together
on an iPad using blocks and then print
your design our app is the key to
turning your ideas into reality and
we've made sure it's easy enough for
everyone to use without any prior
experience as long as you have access to
the Internet you can control your anvil

inventors
students designers hobbyists families or
just for fun
most 3d printers are expensive large
noise being complicated use and they
have to be tethered to your computer the
eye box nano is affordable it is
extremely quiet and it's very easy to
use you can print the eye box Nano from
any computing device that has a browser
most resin printers have loud flowing
feeds
they also require both changes every two
to eight thousand hours our printers are
Wi-Fi enabled and they also allow
browser-based printing from any browser
on any platform androids iPhones you
name it you can print without installing
any software you want to there's also a
10-hour battery pack that's optional if
you'd like to trade on the go finally
the main housing that you've constructed
from acrylic which is a lot stronger
than glass about 17 times weighs about
half as much that's extremely good the
Nano uses UV LEDs designed the last 17
years 8 hours per day that a lot of
greedy so it actually really is
surprising how many different things you
can make with a 3d printer you know I'm
really excited about the 3d printer not
just because it's a affordable
especially for a college student like me
but affordable take it wherever
little figurines for
museums are your kids I love to play
chess so being able to customize my own
pieces create my own set and if I lose a
piece and just print out another one you
can
one little robot or you can actually
make a big robot with peacefully that
you actually clip them together if you
have one big robot and you really just
don't know what you can make until you
get a 3d printer brain inside coffee
shop take it to the library which is
perfect it's really silent you never
quite know what you can do 3d printer
really actually give up ourselves we
didn't set out to improve 3d printing we
set out to remove the barriers and get
3d printers everything that's why we
created the world's smallest quietest
and most affordable
present from almost all the work is done
we've been to many iterations with
design and we are ready for mass
production and that's where you come in
we need your support to reach the volume
necessary to achieve our cost
