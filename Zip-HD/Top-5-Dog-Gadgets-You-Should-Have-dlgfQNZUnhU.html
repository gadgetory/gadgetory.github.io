gold coin
or even liquid gold what if there were a
magic solution that could collect all
your dog's poop without any direct hand
contact because in reality your dog
doesn't poke gold introducing piccaboo a
thought parents dream Kickapoo is made
up of two parts a rounded clip of soft
silken cushions that secures comfortably
around your dog's tail and a durable
disposable collection bag that hangs
beneath place pick up on your dog's tail
before you go out for a walk
and when he is ready to poop all the
dropping is fall directly into the
connection bag when your dog is finished
pooping you just unclip the bag and
throw it away
with no mess and no leakage in the real
world
dog poop is not gold we love our dogs
but don't love cleaning up after them
the hurricane 9 is the world coolest new
fetch toy it's time to reinvent your
game of fetch with this 100 plus foot
gravity-defying flying ring vulture dog
owners already love the hurricane eye hi
this is my dog Turkey and these are your
average dog toys frisbees no answer
Turkey's gone
as soon as I pull out look he goes
creepy oh they just want to suck the
ball he was gonna take the frisbee
the hurricane 9 ring launcher built to
give your dog maximum exercise in just a
fraction of the time it's made from
durable EBA foam which is built to
withstand the sharpest teeth you don't
have to replace the Rings after just one
game of fetch forget about those
slobbery tennis balls
the hurricane 9 works indoors it floats
and yet you can take it to the dog park
all dogs love the hurricane 9 even if
your dogs not typically the type to
chase the tennis ball within months
after launch the hurricane 9 was already
featured on the news check this out
Fargo as the new fire power and it was
selected as a top 5 must-have toy at the
San Diego pet expo did I mention it was
invented by a rocket scientist hi I'm
John Hunter co-inventor of the hurricane
9 I work at high speed airplanes Solar
airplanes and now the world's most
bodacious dog toy and one day I was
working on a sporty good that would fly
a really long ways based on an airplane
wing like this we taking it between
wrested the circle and flies eccentric
mile I took it to my daughter's house
and just for fun I tried it in front of
her dog Amos Amos went crazy so I
immediately realized after about 20 more
shots that he was really like this thing
we had a great dog toy argument here we
go dogs near the nameks 101
while we've been teaching dogs we've
been talking to dog trainers to
something really great about this toy is
I also float so if you have an active
dog who likes the water would be a great
idea as well
like most of us Emma's owner is a busy
person and so she doesn't get that daily
exercise a studies show is proven to
make a healthy happy pub and so she's
left a dream of that blissfully
exhausting game of fetch after just two
launches your dog has already run the
length of a whole football field and
it's easy to you you just load the ring
pull it back and release if you use it
inside just pull it back part of the way
and if you're feeling old-fashioned just
throw it without the launcher you go
tiger it also doubles as a great
training
the hurricane 9 comes with three rings
with six rings or with six rings sold
separately introducing brilliant pad the
world's first indoor self-cleaning potty
pad system that gives you freedom and
flexibility with better hygiene for you
and your dog here's how it works
the dog goes potty and the pad absorbs
liquids and begins to dry out fallen
then the system replaces the soiled pad
with a fresh clean one a barrier lining
wraps and filled ways to lock away odor
the system is hands-off for weeks at a
time then disposal is fast easy and
clean simply replace the youth roll with
a new one
each roll equates to 27 traditional pads
brilliant pad is also better for the
environment the pad use 1/3 less
material than traditional tack and the
end caps and rods are biodegradable

option when they're sick or need to go
in the middle of the night and they
won't get uncomfortable from holding it
too long brilliant pad is automatic

improves health and hygiene for you and
your dog relax

wait I'm in the middle of something
oh that's cute okay where was I
hi my name is pet Q yes I am that
perfect cube you see on your screen
first of all let me ask you this what do
you think happens with your pet when you
are not around and how do you handle it
20% of Americans feed their TVs on to
entertain their loved ones personally I
think that's insane have you seen
daytime television I'm here to say no to
kitty catty couch potatoes I am petcube
and I am the best way to always be close
to your pet here's how it works
inside me is a wide-angle camera a
microphone and a laser pointer all that
goodness is connected to your home Wi-Fi
if you have a smartphone you can see
your pets hear them talk to them and you
called it play with them using my laser
pointer and here's the best part while
you're playing a live game on your
smartphone you can actually tell people
that you're busy exercising your pets I
mean that's also true right but wait
there's more through the built-in
software you can save photos and HD
videos of your pets and share them
anywhere you can imagine you also get to
share access with your pet with all your
friends and family in the future I will
live at pet shelters so everybody will
have a chance to play with rescued
animals and maybe adopt one of them so
here's the part I haven't mentioned yet
I am the only path cube in existence and
it gets lonely even
if you want me or someone exactly like
me in your home back this project and
stay close to your past I came up with
an idea for path cube when a heads real
problem was my neighbors they threatened
to call the cops on my dog because she
barked and scratched all the time when I
left him home alone and pet cube solve
this problem it gets rocky entertained
and distracted now I want to see my body
for another dreamer and it means the
world to me to stay connected with you
pat you looks beautiful believe me it
feels great sir smooth polished
aluminium casing needs not beat on glass
on the front side gone with all and
material that could be quite firm and
very difficult to damage it have the
river loop which allows participant area
