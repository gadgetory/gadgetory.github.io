smallest personal vehicle ever made like
you we think commuting is a drag so we
went looking for the perfect personal
vehicle that is fast fun and safe to
ride an electric skateboard the fun ones
are huge the smaller ones were hard to
learn and none of them delivered the
intelligence stability and smoothness
that a spare time skater could
confidently ride we realize that the
ultimate everyman skateboard simply
didn't exist so we invented it backed by
the investors who innovated drone
technology powered by the same battery
time as a test line spectra is the
world's first and only board equipped
with an ever learning 3d posture control
algorithm that means you can escape
hands-free no app or remote required
what's more inspectorate's futuristic AI
learns your movements over time and
adjust to give you the smoothest can
take this ride possible if you can walk
you can ride spectrum controlling it
with your feet to go forward and to
break let's take a look at safety when
your child or significant other rides
through traffic you want more than a
performance you want to promise Spectras
four-point security technology covers
as for portability ride to work in style
and store it in the commuter backpack
that's already won the red dot design
award for compact sweep it though it's
the world's most portable personal
vehicle spectra delivers a solid 19
minutes of right time at fifteen point
five miles per hour imagine taking a
product and making it safe again imagine
giving freedom to people with
disabilities imagine delivering a
cost-effective way for people to get
around well you can stop imagine we
present you the other suit
just six months ago the rage was the
hoverboard we've seen them and the funny
videos that go along with them everybody
wanted one and most of you have we
created patent-pending cover sheet to
solve the problems typically associated
with public boards and we have created a
new one safe mode of transport that
virtually anybody can drop as well as
being easy for any day to spear operate
the hover seat is comfortable versatile
and has many practical uses always
wanted to try other boards but we're
afraid of falling well now there's a way
to get your hoverboard on and it looks a
little safer than the traditional device
its seating
the hover seat was invented out of
necessity the hover seat is a
lightweight aluminum it measures 30
inches wide by 37 inches in width and
weighs just under 10 pounds it's easy to
install and overboard you with a six
inch or 10 inch wheelbase can handle up
to 250 pounds it takes any beach chair
easy to store you can attach a cooler to
it even a kayak or paddle board and just
when you thought we were done if you can
even attach another hover suit for your
second passenger you can pretty much
attach everything except for an
18-wheeler the hover seat is nothing
less than revolutionary and personal
transportation we have created a
solution to a major safety problem based
out of South Florida we are a small team
with entrepreneurial minded individuals
looking to solve problems and have fun
in the process
right now all the engineering has been
done and we have tested the prototypes
the money we raise will be used to take
the hover seat from prototype to
production aside from being safe these
are fun meet thread road a specially
designed piece of furniture that
automatically stores are closed think of
it as your personal assistant that puts
away a load of clean laundry after your
washer and dryer are finished with
thread robe you have no more folding no
more hanging and best of all your
clothes are always put away and
organized when washers and dryers were
invented in the 1950s they were
technology breakthroughs but we have
been stuck with folding and hanging our
clothes ever since
thread rove makes laundry simple when
your dryer is finished remove the entire
pile of clothing and place it directly
into the Wardrobe shut the door and your
job is done the Wardrobe uses simple
automation to separate and hang each
item inside of storage area specially
designed hangers safely grip the
clothing place them in cradles inside
the unit and store the items until you
recall them when you need something to
wear select items in the mobile app then
choose to dispense them now or schedule
them to be dispensed at a future date
and time the app notifies the Wardrobe
to retrieve the selected items place
them in the same bed use for loading and
steam them to your specifications your
clothes are returned fresh wrinkle free
and ready to wear the thought of never
having to fold laundry again is amazing
but the thread rope app is equally as
innovative it provides complete control
of your clothing and your wardrobe all
of your fingertips if we can access our
digital music from anywhere in the world
we should be able to better manage the
thousands of dollars of clothing that we
own even when we're not at home imagine
scheduling your outfits for the week all
from the back seat of an uber thread
robe is smart it knows what's cleaned
and what's dirty helps you pack for
trips ensuring you don't forget anything
it even shows you data about how you
wear your clothes and the composition of
your closet when you take the app
shopping with you they will match items
you're thinking of purchasing with
clothing you already own I'm Matt Powell
in a world with driverless cars and
drone delivery systems we should be able
to eliminate one of the most
time-consuming household chores and
modernize the way we manage our clothes
the engineers that built thread robe
I've worked on everything from laser
defense systems to autonomous lawn
mowers our thread Rove team is working
hard to ship our first unit in mid 2018
join us in making folding and hanging
laundry a thing of the past
rethink it's technology that's long
overdue
