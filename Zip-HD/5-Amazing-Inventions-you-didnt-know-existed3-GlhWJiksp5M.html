I'm late
when I'm in a hurry I tend to forget
things lucky for me they gave me a new
app for this video it just notified me
that I left my garage door open
it's called garage a garage it works
with your existing garage door opener to
monitor your garage door and proactively
notify you when you've left it open
allowing you to open and close the door
from your smartphone anywhere you have
internet access unlike other systems
there are no other cost or monthly
subscription fees to pay it's super
simple to setup just attach a couple
wires to your existing garage door use
the included sticky pad to apply the
unit to the bottom of your opener and
plug it in finally stick the reflector
on the garage door and you're all set
it's that simple and just like that I've
closed my garage door now Poland garage
it can help me find my coffee another
great use for garage it when you get
dropped off but you forgot your keys Hey

bolo is a true innovation combining two
of humanity's most important inventions
to date the knife and the wheel creating
a one-of-a-kind rolling knife your
perfect kitchen accessory bolo makes
preparing your meals faster and easier
the engineered circular blade coupled
with bolo sturdy construction allows you
to achieve chef quality precision in
your cutting and bolo easily tackles
many of the jobs your other knives can't
do the ergonomic handle makes bolo more
functional and more comfortable than
your regular kitchen knives as a chef a
product designer and a housewares
manufacturer I've worked with then
studied knives for over 30 years and I
find they all have one common deficiency
the angle of the blade and the grip on
the handle puts too much stress on your
wrist and hand what will change is all
of that by placing the force of your
hand directly above the blade you get
better precision cutting while relieving
your hand and wrist from unnatural
movements the result perfectly cut food
each and every time fast and easy and
the special blade break even turns bolo
into a chopper and cleaning bolo could
not be easier
just open at both ends remove the blade
and rinse
