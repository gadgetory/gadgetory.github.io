Oh
available in four and six person mode
people want to grill food spontaneously
and many times I thought to myself hey
you know I want to build this I don't
want to go through the motions of having
to start a grill and doing a whole
cleanup so I thought to myself well how
can I get this done in ten minutes it
raised the grill it works and feels like
an appliance the razor hero combines the
best of a chimney starter with utility
of a political grill and means that you
can get this game started with minimal
effort and it feels just like an
extension of something to use in your
kitchen usually you know you lived by
yourself you don't really grow up in
yourself you know when did that really
happen but now you can do it with this
you can just say like hey I want to have
that state I want to have that that
charger burger and you know this is
going to give you that that case that
you know charcoal can provide Bob
sometimes when I come back home from
work and ATM and I
and I can think to myself hey you know
I'd love to go to grab some tornado
start this grill and in ten minutes it's
ready so this is really you know giving
me a lot of flexibility one of the key
features is that it can start in seven
minutes
so this is something that takes about as
long as it takes to boil a pot of water
say it is that easy to get started it's
really manageable so you can get that
thing going and in 15 minutes you can
have food ready on the plate this grill
is portable enough that you can use on a
balcony a patio it's really low-key so
you can do that a public space it's
great for a lot of vacations I cooked
with 3 deport people understand when
we're drilling with friends we want to
socialize and be closer to everyone and
this grill allows you to grill and at
the same time and so it's something that
anyone everyone in hope you to
participate in this grill uses so little
charcoal the users of approximately 1/3
of the typical portable grill to start
it you would use some kindling materials
like component paper or I recommend
using starter kits and then you just
stand back and after seven minutes
already has a 10 by 10 inch grill
surface so that would accommodate for
lamb burger patties or two states and a
cleanup is really easy too so all the
charcoal is contained inside this
container so to the side you might have
run out
our or you can use water and you simply
put it out because it's so easy to use
it so flexible you're going to be able
to do spontaneous grilling I'm raising
money to bring this out to everyone
we've taken a lot of considerations on
the simplicity of manufacturing we've
worked with several engineers that have
extensive experience in acting to make
sure this process is easy you should be
able to deliver this and mass-produced
this of a very low risk this is going to
be something we can deliver really
quickly everyone deserves to be able to
spontaneous as well and the laser drill
does that imagine taking a product and
making it safe again imagine giving
freedom to people with disabilities
imagine delivering a cost effective way
for people to get around well you can
stop imagine we present you the hover CT
just six months ago the rage was the
hoverboard you've seen them and the
plenty videos that go along with them
everybody wanted one and most of you
have we created patent-pending covers to
solve the problems typically associated
with public wars and we have created a
new one
State Road Transport that virtually
anybody can draw as well as being easy
for any age to spear operators the hover
seat is comfortable versatile and has
many practical uses always wanted to try
on hoverboards but we're afraid of
falling well now there's a way to get
your hoverboard on and it looks a little
safer than the traditional device its
seating
the hover seat was invented out of
necessity the hover seat is a
lightweight aluminum it measures 30
inches wide by 37 inches in width and
weighs just under 10 pounds easy to
install and hoverboard you have a six
inch or 10 inch wheelbase can handle up
to 250 pounds takes any beach chair easy
to store you can attach a cooler to it
even a kayak or paddleboard and just
when you thought we were done but you
can even attach another hover seat for
your second passenger you can pretty
much attach everything except for an
18-wheeler the hover seat is nothing
less than revolutionary and personal
transportation we have created a
solution to a major safety crop based
out of South Florida we're a small team
of entrepreneurial minded individuals
looking to solve problems and have fun
in the process for those who are
passionate about golf and once you
improve their game it's important to
have a proper set of guidelines and a
good reference when they're practicing
so I designed this to simplify an
enhancement process to help everyone
gain confidence for every swing the new
and improved rebase GFA zone is a
revolutionary swing trainning aid it is
the lightest soft swing analyzer in the
world inside the compact design the
advanced motion tracking engine it's
powered by an AB and three axis
accelerometer and gyroscope sensor it
digitized as your swing motion into
10,000 data points and delivers a 3d and
immediately that along with key swing
metrics to your mobile device now you
can compare each swing with your best
ones or your instructors can make
adjustments and track your improvement
progress it will show you every flaw you
know about your swing and even the ones
you don't
it is ultra easy to use just attach it
to any golf club you want to practice it
connect it with the GSA's own app on
your smartphone or tablet and swing away
I've told thousands of students over the
past 20 years and I see many common
problems the life of city dwellers is
far too busy and they find it difficult
to find time and a place to practice
with proper coaching with GSA's own it
helps my students feel there's always a
coach guiding them they can practice
anytime and anywhere so I can give our
constructive guidelines with just a tap
of my phone so even without me that can
be guided during their practice when I
meet them in person I can discuss the
problems of the swing through precise
data and 3d demonstration therefore each
lesson is tailored to each student to
help them improve their swing at three
bays we want to help all golfers improve
their swing and thanks to our supporters
our first-generation golf swing analyzer
is already a success now we're asking
you the Kickstarter community to help us
launch them much improve device to the
world
this device can definitely help each
golfer achieve a new level of confidence
in this room it's a great companion for
practice sessions and the turf
so to use the three bays GSA's own is a
truly remarkable product not only does
it help my students improve their swing
for mine too
