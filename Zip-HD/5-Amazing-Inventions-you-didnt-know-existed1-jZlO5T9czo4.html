to keep the people we love safe and
that's why we made salt the first safe
gun for a safe home
hi I'm Adam this is Andy we're the
creators of salt salt is a gun but it's
not like any gun that you've ever seen
it was designed around the belief that a
firearm shouldn't have to take a life in
order to protect a life from that simple
idea we started by completely rethinking
the bullet instead of LED salt was
designed to shoot a specialized round
filled with a powerful toxin so instead
of killing the target salt opens up on
impact and a cloud that instantly causes
respiratory and visual distress so while
an intruder or a curious child would be
incapacitated encounter wouldn't be
fatal
this rethink also lets salt be used not
only offensively but defensively as well
so if an intruder is kicking down your
door solve allows you to shoot the area
around it before the danger is on top of
you this creates a protective cloud of
toxin between you and the intruder
before he's ever a threat to you or your
family our last big idea was to make
salt easy to use for everyone so we
replaced the violent bang of black
powder with a silent power of compressed
air the result is a fear free user
experience so the only person that
should have anything to be scared of is
an intruder and that's all a safe gun
for a safe home
are you tired of using a remote control
for your air conditioner
well meet the touch AC all you need to
do is swipe this baby and the room is
automatically filled with cool
refreshing air let's look at this
imbecile doing the rain dance trying to
control the temperature bouncing like
that I probably sweat like a pig anyway
when I want to control the temperature I
use sensible it's based on a simple idea
really just make me feel good hey Paul
and Dan what's the temperature in the
room right now degrees is it hot or cold
hot
you see nobody cares what the exact
temperature is it's just about being
comfortable sensible is a device that
turns any remote controlled AC into a
connected super smart one so smart
factor that you choose full automatic
mode you'll never have to think about
your AC ever again sensible turns up the
heat before you wake up in the winter it
cools your house down before you come
home in the summer it's like your mom
and dad just out having to hear about
its back problems hi mom
I'd like to take a brief moment and
explain how sensible is installed
oh look here is a team behind sensible
engineers designers visionaries they've
invested years of their lives in this
product not only to make your life more
comfortable but also because of a green
agenda not that the other green
yes sensible reduces the energy your AC
uses by an average of 40 percent making
it good for the planet and for your
electricity bill personally I don't care
about earth but if it doesn't bother me
I don't mind letting it exist its app is
so beautiful and intuitive you'll get
things done in less than two seconds and
spend the extra twenty seconds you just
saved on staring at it and admiration
and there's an app for pebble to live in
a rented apartment sensibo can be moved
from AC to AC here's how sensible even
works with your 20 year old
remote-controlled AC cuz an old dog can
learn new tricks fetch
I don't need your help but these guys do
if you back sensibo they can begin the
manufacturing process and improve your
quality of life significantly but more
importantly they'll be able to pay me
for being in this video Thank You
Centeno
we do in almost every morning and over
33% of us do it at least three times a
day hitting that snooze button that
irresistible urge to snooze the standard
company bed is something we fight every
morning and it makes us late brush out
the house that's stuck in stressful
traffic and lose valuable morning time
it's time we stop using to the snooze
this is ruggy the world's best alarm
clock getting on a bed has never been so
easy simply stop your alarm by resting
your beep on its soft memory foam
padding
thank you just fall back into bed my
keys along with needs to sense your
pressure for at least 3 seconds and now
that you're up Raghu rewards you with
customizable speeches have it's a daily
motivation or just something positive in
a funny voice just to start your day off
right the true beauty of Ruggie
is that it lets you easily get out of
bed earlier because it's no secret early
risers are often linked with success the
CEOs of Apple and Starbucks championed
athletes like Mike Tyson and Kobe are
all known to be early birds and when you
effortlessly get out of bed early if the
optimistic became minutes to your days
hours to weeks and days to years extra
time is spent on what you want to do
before what you have to spend it with
our loved ones our on ourselves to focus
and achieve whatever it is that we want
meet drop ler a simple and elegant way
to put you in touch with your water use
habits in real time what drop ler is
able to do is that I can just listen to
what's happening in your room and no one
water is on and when it's off so I've
always been pretty badass saving one the
thing is with dropping such a big deal
I wanted to know exactly how much water
I was really wasted but these habits so
the first place I went looking was my
monthly water bill but the thing is
they're completely indecipherable like
mine says how much water reviews and
CCF's
I have no idea what I see CFS over the
last two decades there's been just huge
advances in audio recognition technology
now you've got things like Siri and
Shazam that can tell you what piece of
music you're listening to just being in
the room what drop ler is able to do
using that sound sensor is that I can
just listen to what's happening in your
room and no one water is on and where
it's off the LEDs track a budget they
essentially for each day it allocates a
water budget so that you can see your
reduction of water usage over time each
day the LED will reset based on the
budget for that day using dropper
couldn't be easier just plug it in
launch the app set up your budget for
the day the more you turn on the water
droplet will tell you how much water
using a real time so it also pairs with
your phone and what's great about is
that you can set your goals but as well
monitor and see how you're doing over
time and see if you're improving there's
one more special thing about drop ler it
is built with a nice and platform that
means it is completely modular inside
and unlike other smart devices that go
out of date every one or two years you
decide what it becomes next when the
next generation or droplet comes out you
can choose to upgrade just the part you
want and when you're ready for a
complete change use the modules and new
products we know that droplet by itself
isn't going to save the planet the thing
is if you can't even tell how much water
you're using you can't change your
habits and that's what droplet does it
lowers it barriers for people to find
out how much water they're using so that
they can do something
Tesla suit is a full-body haptic suit
that lets you touch and feel sensations
and virtual reality the haptic system
uses mild electrical impulses to
transmit signals through the skin and
muscles the technology is used widely in
physical therapy to help train muscle
groups as well as the pain relief we've
adapted that technology to help transmit
signals through virtual reality
stimulating massive potential everything
changed this is the real deal this is
not some fictional processor this is
definitely future nailed it this is
worth developing for the potential of
the Tesla suit is enormous I've always
been a big fan of we are and wanted to
find something that would make a small
career there wasn't anything that let's
party interact with civilians world
beyond division so we started developing
necessary it took us three prototypes to
be able to deliver pleasurable realistic
sensations the reason following
Kickstarter campaign now was to get SDK
and Tesla suit in the hands of
developers and build communities that
will take project to the next level we
spent a lot of time developing tests as
you we designed our smart textile from
scratch it's durable washable and
comfortable to the earth we made two
versions pioneer which has sixes impact
points and prodigy which has 52 impact
points which means more reality
experience the onboard control unit
connects wirelessly to any device such
as games consoles VR headsets
mobile phones and tablets PCs and Macs
taking the potential applications of
Tesla suit well beyond gaming I think
it'd be very interesting with her
beautiful UVA
and I'm sure there are many other uses
that people come up with for it and I
could definitely see lots of different
uses usage for it right away from gaming
to medical to sports exercise it
obviously this gaming applications but I
can imagine a lot to get up to if this
then that and get notifications on
whether or if I've missed an email from
my girlfriend or my boss or something as
a subtle additional cue that no one else
would see first the living industry for
pretty much every industry as well and
if we can start this offered be
something exceptionally Oh with the game
with with someone shooting you
I think it'd be a very honorable for
military training enjoy most about is
potential to be used in any work in any
industry from music to health the
re-education to a pleasure and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
