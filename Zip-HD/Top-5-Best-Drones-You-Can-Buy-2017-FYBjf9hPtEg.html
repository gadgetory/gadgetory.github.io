you know it and there's a good chance
that the drone videos you've seen online
were shot with one of our cameras this
time we started small so you can dream
big we created your first personal drone
but we're still squeezing in big power
it automatically follows you or whatever
you want without a bracelet or tracker
avoids obstacles and comes packed with a
4k stabilized camera 27 minute flight
time and a whole lot more this is the
DJI navigate co unfolded to make it this
small we have to rip out a ton of cool
stuff right now it's got 24
high-performance computing cores dual
satellite connectivity and all new
transmission system with a 4.3 mile
range for vision sensors and more sound
complicated it's not it's easy
the Mavic knows where it takes off from
where it is in the air where it's going
and what is capturing when you take off
the MAV accuses to vision sensors and
connects with up to 20 satellites also
it can remember your location this means
the Mavic knows where home is so it can
return by itself precision landing
technology needs it can land almost
exactly where you took off at the touch
of a button as you fly satellite systems
keep track of you working in harmony
with all four vision sensors telling it
what's below and what's in front whether
you are flying beside a cliff in a
forest or even indoors just like you
Mavic see and things
that means it can avoid the things in
its path from trees to walls any good
flying camera needs stabilization the
Maddox expertly miniaturized gimble
keeps the entire camera steady
unlike electronic stabilization you use
every pixel from the sensor and you
don't have the weight of a bulky add-on
camera shooting an epic tracking shot of
a friend is easy active track technology
means it just takes a few taps not just
one kind of tracking shot either
it's got spotlight profile and trace or
use tap flight to tap and fly terrain
follow mode keeps the Mavic at a height
you define as the ground Rises so you
can focus on your shot me not your
height everything can be controlled
using a gamepad sized controller you can
keep in your pocket it opens up to clamp
around your phone and has been custom
engineered to give you more feedback and
more accuracy you will always feel in
control
if you don't want to bother with the
controller fly using virtual joysticks
right from your phone over Wi-Fi whether
you fly with the remote controller or
just your phone active track modes are
ready to make you shoot like a pro
