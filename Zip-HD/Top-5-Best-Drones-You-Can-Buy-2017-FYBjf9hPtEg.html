forest or even indoors just like you
Mavic see and things
that means it can avoid the things in
its path from trees to walls any good
flying camera needs stabilization the
Maddox expertly miniaturized gimble
keeps the entire camera steady
unlike electronic stabilization you use
every pixel from the sensor and you
don't have the weight of a bulky add-on

a friend is easy active track technology
means it just takes a few taps not just
one kind of tracking shot either
it's got spotlight profile and trace or
