you've ever hosted a barbecue you have
this beer running out of propane nothing
kills a party quicker than uncooked food
you can lift or tap the tank but that is
not an accurate way to measure just how
much propane is left that's why we
invented the original gas watch and the
gas watch digital we've sold millions of
units of the original gas watch so we
know what we're doing and now we want to
take that technology and bring it to the
mobile market introducing the smart gas
watch which uses the Bluetooth in your
phone to connect to the gas watch mobile
app so you never run out of propane at a
crucial
time ever again the smart gas watch lets
you see how much propane is left in the
tank and shows you exactly how much
grilling time you have left before empty
a low-level alarm will sound when you're
getting close to empty the smart gas
watch is incredibly easy to set up and
easy to use no tools are required at all
simply place your tank on the scale
download the app and launch when you're
ready it's that easy you'd never go on a
road trip without knowing how much gas
you have left in the fuel tank so why
would you have a barbecue without
knowing how much propane is left is
there anything better than spending time

fire hazard and require constant
monitoring so that you don't burn your
food yucky ah plus when you're out of
fuel you're out of luck
how is it in the age of the microchip
that we're still cooking with the fuel
of our grandparents that's why we made
the gosun grill a game-changing solar
cooker that roasts a meal for eight is
as simple as cooking with gas and all
without a drop of fuel it's easy to use
and easy to maintain it's a bake oil and
fry retaining your foods nutrition
leaving the rich natural flavor the
gosun never needs refueling it's like
having a power plant disguised as a
grill plus it's the first solar cooker
to effectively cook a meal anytime day
or night for 15 years I've sunk my teeth
into everything solar but I've struggled
to find a simple durable and affordable
cooking solution but I found it in 2013
we launched the gosun sport our first
portable and practical solar cooking
solution we were met with overwhelming
support and have since developed a
global community of passionate users in
more than 45 countries we are now
partnered with the Global Alliance for
clean cookstoves to bring this
technology to those who could benefit
the most from capturing the power of the
Sun one of the best things about this
business that we're constantly receiving
feedback from our users we love to hear
their stories and how they put our
technology to use and some of the
feedback we're getting consistently that
they want it to be bigger we listen the
possibilities are truly endless
I find the ghost on solar cooker to be a
high-performance high temperature solar
cooker and it's a lot of fun to cook
with cook anything from soups to to
slaves you'll notice the difference with
consistent cooking temperatures
throughout the tube the vital moisture
of your food is kept intact leaving
better flavor and more nutrition the
ghost Sun is simply a healthier way to
prepare a meal it goes where other girls
can't and stays cool to the touch no
matter how hot due to the tubes nearly
perfect insulation the ghost Sun can
cook in even the most extreme condition

change battery you can cook with a Sun
tea even at night the battery is a
game-changer

80% efficiently it's probably the best
solar energy converter yet more than

testing Guatemala we're ready to move
