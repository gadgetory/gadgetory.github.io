introducing

deep passion for uncompromised image
quality is the simple philosophy behind
the zenmuse x7
together with the inspire - it marks the
next evolution in DJ eyes aerial imaging
technology
the inspire tune has become a standard
aerial platform used on film sets around
the globe the new Zen music 7 transforms
it into the world's first fully
integrated aerial platform featuring a
super 35 millimeter sensor for video
recording
the x7 offers video resolution of up to
six K
hi-resolution not only provides
incredible detail but also allows
reframing
raw and ProRes codex integrate
seamlessly into industry standard
post-production workflows
14 stops of dynamic range and hands
grading flexibility by preserving detail
in shadow and highlight areas the large
sensor also enables filming with a
cinematic shallow depth of field and low
image noise
an ISO range of 102 25600 makes it
suitable for use in all lighting
situations the new DJI cinema color
system consists of two parts an updated
D log curve for extended dynamic range
and a D gamut RGB color space for
preserving maximum color information
when I first took a look at this x7
footage it really has a color fidelity
there so the dynamic range of colors
that it can reproduce and I can push the
grades around pretty hard and I still
don't get noise with this camera the
superb picture quality of the Zen music
7 is an asset on every film set a new AI
mode makes it easy to match with
different cameras used for TV series
commercials and documentaries as well as
for feature films DJI also proudly
introduces the world's first aerial lens
mount system the DL mount the ultra
short flange distance allows a compact
lens design DJI offers full prime lenses
specifically built for the x7 with focal
lengths of 16 24 35 and 50 millimeters
made with carbon fiber they're
lightweight and durable the advanced
optical elements still have a brilliant
image quality the x7 also captures
stunning DNG RAW or JPEGs still pictures
with a resolution of 24 megapixels with
its sturdy build the x7 was made for
professional cinematography and
ambitious aerial stills photographers it
replaces large and difficult to use
aerial solutions even on high-end film
productions when I think of the x7 I
just think of just an endless amount of
possibilities that cinematographers and
directors can craft their movie with
shots that they may not have even
thought was possible before the Zen
music 7 is a top-of-the-line
professional filmmaking tool making it
