caution do not apply to brakes tire
treads seat or any areas that should not
become slippery it is recommended to oil
the chain and other areas needing
lubrication after cleaning abuser we
live action sports and we're obsessed
with technology but in the past the two
haven't worked well together we're about
to change that
the product we've created is called
mohawk it's an action camera
communication system navigation unit
black box and emergency response system
all wrapped into one you can capture
high-res photos and HD videos with the
press of a button on your wrist or
handlebar mounted remote your media
syncs directly with your smartphone for
easy viewing and sharing if something
really cool happens and you weren't
recording press two buttons to initiate
a hot shot it saves the last 15 seconds
of action pushes it to social media live
in real time you'll never miss a shot
again our cloud-based push-to-talk comms
allowed 12 friends to chat with one
another over any distance using any
Bluetooth headset a world-first mohawk
is loaded with onboard sensors that
allow it to do some really powerful
things it can record all sorts of
information how fast you go what routes
you take your airtime lean angle and
much more it can also detect if you've
been in a collision the black box
feature locks down the last two minutes
of audio video and telemetry information
giving you a full record for happened
leading up to the incident it sends text
message and email alerts to your
emergency contacts and provides them
with your exact GPS location on an
interactive map as well as the local
phone numbers for the three nearest EMS
dispatchers
the perfect ride where roger and
technology come together to create the
definitive riding experience but there
are obstacles sustained exposure
carotenoid over 100 decibel may result
in permanent hearing loss or distract
and fatigue a rider increasing the
probability of a serious accident
traditional solutions simply Lantana
introducing the Senna smart helmet
the only revolutionary helmet that
intelligently control and reduces
harmful riding noise while still
allowing you to clearly hear traffic
sirens and your RP animal how is this
possible
the intelligent noise control system
module snaps in and gets to work
buta lysing for hidden microphones to
effectively capture and dramatically
phase out harmful helmet noise which on
ambient mode to hone in on external
sounds and conversation without the need
to remove your helmet the lightweight
carbon fiber shell is streamlined for
maximum strength and minimal weight
variable ventilation options an
adjustable multi zone foam pad system
and neck roll are designed for ultimate
comfort for everyday riding and it
wouldn't be as bent a helmet without
Bluetooth capabilities
nothing engulfs your Bluetooth module
and activate the world of communication
and music listening capabilities
in conjunction with the intelligent
noise control system you can listen at
volumes lower than ever before the Sena
smart helmet was designed by riders for
riders with safety technology and a more
enjoyable riding experience in mind to
make the most of every mile with a
thinner smart helmet the perfect
companion for the perfect ride this is
John he is an experienced motorcycle
rider John knows that safety is
important which is why he at least wears
this and this and of course this but
what if you could prevent an accent
altogether
well that's Jane hi Jane and this is
break free just like John she too is an
experienced rider and she's all about
safety she knows and being visible at
all times is the key it's a smart LED
light that does sophisticated things
unlike your motorcycle taillight break
free is at eye level
so while drivers can see it'll grow
brighter to alert drivers around you
when you're slowing down no matter how
breaking down shifting or engine brake
turn it on and it stays on no need to
connect it with wires or use an app and
that's what Jane and riders really care
about being seen to prevent an accident
in the first place whether you're this
this this or even this kind of rider
you'll still want this this bridges the
gap between safety and style this is
break free
a smarter way to be seen I've been
writing for the past 10 years and I
loved every second of it I also have a
wife and two beautiful daughters
so my safety is always my top priority
shortly after I graduated college I got
the opportunity to apprentice under a
successful Silicon Valley entrepreneur
while working on one of his new ideas
and autonomous brake light cars I
quickly realized this is the perfect
product for motorcycle riders so let's
break free we're trying to use advanced
manufacturing techniques from companies
like a DMV MOU and bring those to the
consumer market to deliver a safety
product that is like no other one of the
biggest hurdles for the design process
was trying to make our unit fit on as
many helmets as possible and the way we
did this is we took many houses we could
get and we 3d scan the back of them and
what we're trying to get at is a shape
that's going to work for as many homes
as possible and also maximize the
surface area of the light because the
surface area life is obviously important
how much you can see them products that
have been on the market already are all
mounted takes on a vehicle that works
well and can detect acceleration but as
soon as that the head of the rider
starts moving a lot of these devices
give false readings what's special about
the break free device is that we can
detect deceleration in the direction of
travel even though the head of the
writer where the light is mounted may
move sideways and tilt forward the end
goal at BreakFree is to increase safety
for riders we do that in two ways first
created devices that people will want to
wear and the second make something that
works one of the most important aspects
of our safety is our visibility and it's
also one of those things that's most
neglected currently in the market
there's some high vis gear that's
neither in helmet or vest or in pants
and to me I mean it's definitely a step
in the right direction but they're a
static piece they're not going to really
get the attention they're not
really capture kind of a semi glaze
driver if you will
what's nice about this product is it
illuminates and flashes so it's
something that is dynamic it definitely
can make a difference between saving a
life break free is something that's
really unique never seen anything like
it before cars have a triangle of life
these days modern cars the two
taillights the light that's up in the
back window motorcyclists taillights are
generally small and they're designing
them to look even cooler and smaller and
they become even harder to see the brake
tree brings a light that is going to be
noticeable by drivers up into their
basic field of vision
this is why BreakFree needs to exist
BreakFree is bridging the gap between
style and safety I dedicated the last
two years of my life get break free to
where it is that day and this is where
we need your help now we need the
tooling to manufacture our first large
quarter we get break free into the hands
