my brother prescription-drug ADIZ this
could have been prevented by something
as simple as our first product the safer
lock
the safer lock is the first and only
combination locking cap that fits
directly on a medication we've earned
the National parenting seal of approval
the moms best award and even been chosen
by a coalition of over 40 nonprofits at
the top five technology to reduce
prescription drug abuse in the United
States prescription drug abuse is the
fastest growing drug problem in the u.s.
in fact 2,500 children begin
experimenting for the first time every
day it's a very complex issue though
with many causes but addressing the ease
of access within the home is critical in
fact according to the Center for Disease
Control 98% of all prescription drugs
that are abused originate in the home
where an only 3% are locked up and this
is why we created safer lock as Joe
mentioned this is the first and only
combination locking cap on the market we
do own the patent on this product there
are 10,000 possible combinations the
consumer sets the combination to their
preference and without knowledge of the
combination no one can get in without
