outside the home and instantly send us
text alerts as well as photos or video
when there's someone at the front door

to talk with them if we want to we want
to be able to do these things from
wherever we are whether that's at home
in our car at the office at the beach or
even out of town it wouldn't it be great

the pets the babysitter or a sick family
member how about being able to monitor

more she loves returning home Sarah
often rents out her home while she's
away like all of us she sometimes
wonders if everything is all right at
home Sarah wanted peace of mind but not
to make her guests uncomfortable with
cameras now she uses point-point

Sarah's home senses what's in the air
and lets her know if anything is wrong
point can recognize sounds like guests
arriving or if a window breaks its
innovative sensor technology also
recognizes things like smoke cigarette
fumes and other common home hazards
point is simple and unbranded allowing
it to blend into any home anywhere it
connects to the internet over Wi-Fi and
sends notifications to your smart phone
I can choose what events I get notified
about like cigarette smoke I can also
set a threshold for the acceptable noise
level in my apartment at different hours
if it is too loud point will glow yellow
as a friendly reminder to keep it down
I'm only alerted if the noise level
remains really high I want to keep good
friends with my great neighbors point
let's Sarah know everything is alright
when she's away like feeling a heartbeat
from home
security isn't about a siren everyone
ignores security is about people it's
about knowing who should and shouldn't
be there so we feel safe and worried
let's meet cocoon

that really understands what's going on
so that it can make intelligent
decisions all by itself to protect you
and your home
a home security system like that would
allow you to live your life to the
fullest without having to think twice
about what's going on
I still remember seeing the front door
open after coming home from a weekend
trip someone had forced his way into our
home and all our valuables were taken
still the worst part was seeing my
nephew Alex just thinking someone had
broken into a most intimate space making
very scared
it made me search for a security system
where all available options were
expensive complicated ugly and intrusive
I wanted to change that so I started
working in wheels on prototypes now I am
proud to present a bodyguard a home
security system that can think and act
all by itself it's easy to install is
powered by rechargeable batteries and
connects to the internet over Wi-Fi and
cellular networks inside we have an HD
camera motion sensor microphone
temperature sensor accelerometer speaker
and siren that is a lot of technology to
put in a very small package but the real
strength lies in the software using
artificial intelligence you can
recognize your face voice or detect your
fast it knows when you left your home it
activates automatically so there's no
need for you to enter security codes
anymore by analyzing the audio it can
detect potential burglary noises such as
smashing or opening the door it does not
affect the users but it may scare the
burglar by playing home sounds such as
people talking or someone doing the
dishes in the kitchen we build body
guard with data privacy in mind as it
only uses a small amount of data to keep
your home safer having to seek knowledge
ease it provides great freedom for you
as you don't have to constantly check
your smartphone for alerts from a
security device simplicity is the
ultimate sophistication
bodyguard has created an intelligent
home security system that can make smart
decisions detect your best interest it
is beautiful easy to use and design to
look good in every home it leaves no
holes in your walls and you can even run
it on batteries making it a perfect fit
for tenants as well even better
bodyguard comes at a fraction of the
cost of currently available home
security systems but just because we
made an affordable security device
doesn't mean it's cheap bodyguard is
easy to use but reliable it is
protective but non-invasive it is
proactive but never annoyed by combining
these powerful features bodyguard has
created a sophisticated home security
system I was previously unattainable for
most people
