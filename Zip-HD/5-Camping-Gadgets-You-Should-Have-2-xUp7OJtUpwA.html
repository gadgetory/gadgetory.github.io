Pacific Northwest rains a fact of life
but it shouldn't keep you from enjoying
the outdoors that's why we're set to
introduce a brand-new crosspoint
waterproof stock crosspoint waterproof
socks look and feel just like regular to
stop they're specially bonded with three
layers to keep your food dry even when
standing aquatic so we offer two
versions one with a merino wool liner
and Wilda coolmax liner
let's feel like regular socks not
plastic bags and feet my name is Ted
I've been running in Portland for about
four or five years now and when you run
in Portland you expect to get wet rain
is sort of a part of life here
especially in the winter with a regular
soft when your trail running you're
always kind of conscientious of where's
the puddle and how am I going to step
around it which when it's really slick
and muddy out the last thing I want to
have to do is dodge things sideways and
with these you just sort of feel like
you can run right through stuff in the
back of my mind I'm always kind of
thinking when I'm going to need to turn
around so that my feet don't get too wet
and you start to have a risk of injury
but with these they've found like the
last thing on my mind is how wet my feet
are getting or what puddles I'm going
through it's more how much I'm going to
push the difference compared to what I
did last time my name is Sam and I work
for beeline we are a bicycle delivery
service in Portland Oregon I'm on my
bike for several hours every day
delivering everything from organic
produce to office supplies a lot of
people ride their bike to work in the
rain but I ride my bike at work in the
rain so I take my waterproofing pretty
seriously so I've been wearing the cross
point sock pretty much any time the
forecast calls for rain kind of a
no-brainer for me the socks are just
super comfortable and they're waterproof
they work when I put them on if one less
thing that I have to think about if
you're working playing the outdoors
don't let rank in your way check out our
new crop points off today
I love going outdoors staying connected
with great Mother Nature and staying
connected with family and friends I love
sharing my adventures but I've realized
that it's really hard to get access to
electricity to stay connected outdoors
the thing is today's mobile devices use
significantly less power than
traditional consumer electronics so one
day I came up with the idea what if we
could convert every energy resource into
personal power I want to introduce you
to estream it's a portable water power
generator it converts any type of
running water into stored energy you can
get personal on-demand power with
nothing but water energy this is how it
works
remove the cover unfold the turbines and
lock them
hook and release eastream into running
water let it spin freely to generate
electricity and it charges the built-in
battery it takes approximately 4.5 hours
to fully charge one e string which can
charge up to 3 smartphones GoPros or
tablet PCs 2 times faster than charging
through an outlet
you can also use it as a lantern with
four different modes even underwater
eastream works well even in weak
currents or behind a kayak and
regardless of the weather or time of day
it fits perfectly into any sized
backpack
it's ideal for use while you enjoy
camping fishing kayaking biking pull any
other outdoor activities
that's the sound of a cooler coming down
off the shelf it's the sound of imminent
fun so why haven't cooler designs change
in almost 50 years
boring coolers are boring break easily
and our pain to get to and from your
destination
I wanted a cooler that was really well
built yet had so much fun built into it
that I would look for excuses to get
outside and enjoy so I created the
coolest
the coolest is a complete redesign of
what a Kluwer can be first you've got
this 18 volt rechargeable blender you
don't realize the number of places you
could really go for a blended cocktail
or smoothie until you've got a blender
built right into the lid you're already
carrying around a cooler full of ice and
tasty beverages why not blend them up
and become a summertime hero anytime
anywhere and what's the party without
music the coolest comes with a removable
Bluetooth speaker that connects to any
smartphone to wirelessly stream music
from up to 30 feet away it's amazing
where speaker technology has come in the
last few years
you can skip songs and adjust the volume
right from your phone and this little
box can really put out some sound and
since you've got that 18 volt battery
for the blender why not get the most out
of it
maybe your camera battery's low or maybe
you have an iPhone and want to use it
after 2:00 in the afternoon
recharge your gear wherever you are with
it's waterproof USB charger the party
doesn't stop just because the Sun Goes
Down and you shouldn't have to freeze
your fingers searching endlessly for
your favorite drink the coolest has
waterproof LED lights embedded in the
lids you can easily find what you're
looking for with the push of a button
one of the biggest half of them outdoor
fun is hauling your gear back and forth
from the car and I've experimented with
various ways to solve the problem I love
coolers with wheels but I hate that they
refuse to help carry anything else the
coolest has you covered with locking
tie-down bungees so you can carry all
your stuff in just one trip and what
about getting organized to go out in the
first place the coolest helps out almost
like a picnic basket and make sure you
always have a few key essentials with
built-in storage for reusable plates /
cutting boards and this awesome rust
proof ceramic knife plus the removable
divider give you a whole new level of
flexible packing options you can pull
the drain plug on one side and your
coolers can stay dry and cool just like
your refrigerator say goodbye to soggy
sandwiches regular cooler tires are
flimsy and sink right into the same we
design the coolest wheels to be twice as
wide to roll twice as easily how many
hours of your life and get lost looking
for a bottle opener my grandpa's cooler
had one so does the coolest we were so
excited when we broke the Kickstarter
record but we're even more proud of how
fantastic the coolest turned out
so if you have the kind of friends and
family who love to get outdoors and want
to turn good times into great memories
and choose your color and get your
coolest today
proud to introduce you to the waka
workout base your lifesaver in dark
times a guardian angel of mobile power
and connectivity the base is intended
for anyone that hates to be out of power
in the event of an emergency or disaster
it's powerful enough for multiple phone
charges or an entire week of light mind
you even on cloudy days the base will
charge though the kit is compact it
still features two custom-designed LED
lights perfect for camping and hiking or
traveling to remote areas
