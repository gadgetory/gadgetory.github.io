experience and enter a new world with VR
real feel race
grab the real field deal and control the
race like never before
with VR real field you control this and
you control the race max force feedback
makes you feel the jumps and crashes the
next level and discover other VR real
field games and enter the action
get in the game with VR real field
racing grab your hardhat and dig into
engineering with remote control machines
construction vehicles construct 8
different vehicles guaranteed to get the
job done like a dump truck with a
motorized bed that can be raised to
empty its Hall and a powerful bulldozer
with a blade that can move dirt and
rocks or construct a concrete mixing
truck with a mixing drum that really
rotates an infrared remote the unit can
control your models driving your
vehicles and moving their work tools the
64-page full-color manual provides
step-by-step building instructions and
teaches how real-life construction
machines work and with over 220 pieces
you can build your own construction
creations yet building with remote
control machines construction vehicles
meet proto max the very first for real
makers codable pop my kids keep asking
for a dog and finally I found the
perfect one with an easy eight piece
build the fun starts the moment they
meet just turn the dial to pick a
personality and watch proto max come to
life then with the app my kids can code
their ultimate pup by programming proto
Max's responses to 10 plus activations
proto max encourages kids to use their
imaginations and their brainpower so
it's fun and they getting intro to
coding they can create super fun
routines then watch proto max strut his
stuff
and the more my kids play the more they
unlock ways to customize and code proto
max and he has issued even one of my
shoes create and code your ultimate up
with proto max from for real makers
with AI recognition algorithm and the
newest robotic check the most advanced
fighting robot is born guy oh the
first-person-shooter robot guarantees
you an unparalleled futuristic robot
game experience camera and an AI chip
allows the diode to auto scan the
environment with visual recognition it
is the first battle robot that can
identify enemies and track them
automatically
connect the dials vision by turning on
your phone get a close-up an exclusive
view of the fight with guy O's highly
accurate steering gear you can
effortlessly track any target at open
fire is your wish
equipped with omnidirectional wheels and
the motor which spins 12,000 rotations
per minute guile is more agile and
faster than other robots scanner totem
and dial will equip you with more
powerful weapons and abilities beat your
enemies the victory is all yours
the all-new battle system supports
teamfight invite your friends to team up
you will have more fun
find a shield
escape from the enemies fire
hide yourself sneak attack
protect your teammate no mercy with your
enemies
seize the opportunity give enemies the
final shoot
the future of dabble robot which gives
you the most incredible experience
introducing and fer a $59 robot anyone
can adopt an PO is an affordable
educational and easy to assemble robot
it takes less than an hour to assemble
and will teach you about robotics ant
bow has six legs and walks just like an
ant plus it is also a robot and plus
robot equals and both designed for
anyone with an inquisitive mind an pho
is a great starting point for young
inventors and for people interested in
steam education even if you are not a
maker it is still a cool robot companion
and you will have fun with once
assembled you can control ant bo-lieve
remote by your own voice or even by
drawing lines with more than one ant bow
you can even make them fight each other
info enhances problem-solving abilities
when you are familiar with how it works
tweak its code and make it do different
things you can also upgrade your robot
with dozens of different sensor modules
and program it via Arduino scratch or
when do Mpho is connected it collects
user data and uploads it to the cloud
users will be able to check metrics like
distance skill levels and
accomplishments and share with friends
info is intelligent it has 30 neurons
that enable it to learn to adapt just
like a real creature as time goes it
becomes smarter faster and more capable
tampo also has emotional reactions to
different scenarios for example glancing
left and right when it feels inquisitive
trembling when it feels threatened and
showing affection and loyalty we are an
experienced team in the design and
manufacture of innovative robot products
and we believe aunt beau is a perfect
start help support our project and give
aunt Beau a home thank you
