let's talk about taking the perfect
photo first compose the shot
check the histogram adjust the exposure
focus on your subject compute the
hyperfocal distance to keep everything
sharp enable bracketing to get more
dynamic range at a neutral density
filter update the exposure and then take
the shot
we built a better way
today's DSLR and mirrorless cameras have
amazing optics and sensors but they do
very little to actually help you take a
good photo
finding the right settings involves a
series of complex techniques and
formulas as an engineer with the
background in artificial intelligence I
knew I could build a tool to simplify
the process I wanted something that
would let me focus on the composition
but would handle the details for me so I
created Arsenal the world's first AI
photography assistant with one tap
Arsenal fine settings to take the best
photo possible Arsenal's AI searches
thousands of images in its database to
suggest good settings next it fine Tunes
the suggestions by analyzing 18
different factors Arsenal uses
state-of-the-art machine learning to
help you take a great photo in any
condition
many of the memorable shots you see
today are captured by combining multiple
exposures through a labor-intensive
process called photo second with Arsenal
you can do this in second capture all
the details and scenes with high dynamic
range get everything in sharp focus and
create long exposures without buying
expensive filters using these advanced
techniques Arsenal lets you go beyond
the limitations of your camera's sensor
lens four times when you want complete
control you can wirelessly adjust manual
settings see a live preview and trigger
the shutter all from up to 100 feet away
Arsenal also improves the experience of
reviewing photos in the field you can
flip through the photos on your camera
zoom in to check out details at full
resolution then share your favorite
photos right from your phone
and finally Arsenal makes it easy to
capture stunning time lapses
it automatically adjusts the exposure in
changing light giving you a smooth
day-to-night transition you can even
watch a high-def preview of your
time-lapse while it's being taken
whether you're a pro who has already
mastered manual shooting or you just
bought your first DSLR Arsenal can help
take your photography to the next level
