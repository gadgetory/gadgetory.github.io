gathering round but the smoke that comes
with it can often get in the way of
sticking around it's time to upgrade
your fire with the bio light fire pit a
Bluetooth controlled wood burning system
that can cook your meals and create an
outdoor floating fire without any of the
smoke
central to the bilat fire pit is the
advanced airflow system an integrated

by burning particulate matter before it
has a chance to escape the fire so you
can go from a spark to smokeless in

plumes of smoke unlike typical fire pits

the palm of your hand with a free bio
light app that talks to your airflow
system to modulate fan speeds the more
air you introduce the hotter the fire

hours of clean burning on a single
charge and it detaches for easy
recharging via micro USB utilize the USB
port on the side to connect bio light

hi I'm Jackie the inventor of the real
wheel or as we like to affectionately
call it the wheel
our family loves outdoor fun we'd love
to take our kids to the beach and
camping and on other outdoor adventures
but hauling the cooler and the towels in
the beach toys can really be a hassle
I've looked for carts that could help
with this situation but none of them
could really move stuff on sand or rough
terrain I couldn't find what I was
looking for so I decided to build it
the wheel lets you carry more make fewer
trips and travel deeper and farther off
the road than ever before the wheel is a
truly rugged all-terrain cart that can
haul up to 200 pounds of anything
anywhere we've engineered the wheel to
have a super wide large diameter
non-slip tire that lets it ride on top
of sand and rocks without sinking in and
getting stuck we also designed the wheel
with a debris resistant rolling feature
to avoid any jamming from rocks or sand
the wheel also maximizes storage so you
can carry everything you need in one
trip heavier gear gets stored inside the
wheel where it's steves stationary while
you're in motion simply pack your gear
in our custom bag which doubles as a
cooler and can fit up to 48 cans or your
beach toys or your camping gear once you
pack the bag simply slide it inside the
wheel and attach it to the quick turn
snaps to hold your gear in place not
only can you store gear inside the wheel
but we have additional storage for
lighter weight care on the built in
tabletop which some carry almost
anything folding chairs are easily
slipped over the handles other viewers
placed on a tabletop and secured by
attaching bungee cords to our built-in
attachment points once you get to where
you're going it's time to relax the
wheel has a built-in table where you can
mix drinks
prepare food and keep it all out of the
sand and dirt the wheel even has
built-in drink holders so you can avoid
drinks spilling on the ground the
built-in kickstand ZAR height adjustable
and quickly transform the cart into a
stable table when you're ready for your
journey simply fold the handles with the
release of a quick pen
load the wheel into your trunk pack the
custom bag and store it inside the wheel
for transport the wheel makes outdoor
fun easier
when you're trying to go as fast as
light as possible obviously weight is a
huge factor but days like that also
demand that you stay fully hydrated so
that you can consistently be performing
at your best those two things really
conflict because water adds a ton of
weight we designed the trail shop micro
filter to help you save weight
essentially it gives you a full day's
water supply at a mere five ounces and
fits in your pocket when I trail run I
like to carry two small water bottles
when those are empty I can use the trail
shot filter to drink directly and
instantly from a stream along the trail
then I can quickly fill my bottles with
clean water and get going again or if
I'm wearing a hydration pack I can
connect it straight to my hose and fill
up my reservoir the trail shaft filter
is so tiny it fits in a stash pocket
alongside my bars and it's quick to
deploy you just drop the pre-filter in
the water and start filtering it treats
a liter of water in 60 seconds the trail
shop filter uses hollow fiber technology
that meets the highest standards for
removing protozoa like Giardia and
Cryptosporidium and bacteria like e.coli
and Salmonella so you have reliable
water all along your journey the filter
cartridge has a 2000 litre lifespan
depending on water conditions which for
me is seasons of water at MSR our goal
is to design products for simplicity and
functionality giving you everything you
need and nothing you don't
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
