friend we want to introduce you to man's
new best friend meet chip octopus a
robotic dog that's much more than just a
cool gadget chip is an interactive pet
that's there to greet you at the door
with the smartband chip recognizes who
his owner is hey have you seen my other
slipper have you seen my other slipper
ah and shows affection to them one near
chip is obedient and can follow commands
but he also learns new things so you can
teach him tricks and the smarter ship
becomes the more badges he earns when
you like what you see just press the
like button on the band which can
encourage him to behave or be a little
mischievous your choices change chips
behavior and chase his personality so
that no two chips are ever alike chip is
a connected experience he has a
translator
what is it chip so you can understand
his thoughts he comes with his own
smartphone so you can play fetch and
stay active together
he also has sensors so you can maneuver
around obstacles with ease
and with the mobile lab you can feed
chip which shows you care and that's
important because when you're in need no
matter it bigger small he's there for
you this is Ethan Sense technology chip
is fully aware of his surroundings
seriously no one seen it this is like
the fifth time he even knows how to
return to his bed when it's time for a
charge hmm so he never runs out of
energy chip is a smart device chip is a
robot chip is a dog but most importantly
chip is
a friend about the best time
you
introducing Robo wunderkind a
revolutionary robotics kit for kids of
all ages which can be programmed and
controlled with smartphones and tablets
Robo tubes can be attached from either
side so you can make different robots
two years ago I was studying computer
science at the University of Technology
and I was building robots on arduino
platform my friends were fascinated by
what I was doing and they also wanted to
build their own robots but it's no fun
and simple way for them to get started
this is why I decided to create a robot
that would be easy to build it code and
accessible for everyone
we are embedding different electronics
such as microcontrollers sensors motors
and divin cameras into the cubes this
way kids can easily build a unique
robots with different functions in any
shape they can imagine
like I'm cypher the designer vortex
vortex is a revolutionary product for
children it is a smart and responsive
robot that kids can play with and
program using the vortex and apps kids
can play different games learn about
robotics and even create their own
playing with vortex is incredibly fun
and easy thanks to its unified system
and intuitive app for example the
bumping fight is a sumo-style party game
suitable for multiple players the
computer inside vortex has sensors to
detect motions like hitting spinning or
being still vortex embraces new
technologies and allows users to
experience them the fugitive is a unique
game with augmented reality and motion
tracking technology children already
love playing with our vortex prototypes
and we can't wait for kids everywhere
to get their own vortex vortex is
compatible with both iOS and Android
devices and comes with an open SDK
anyone who wants to develop a game for
vortex is empowered to do so because
every vortex is a dev kit the only
limits your imagination vortexes app
allows kids to learn to program their
robots in a fun simple and educational
environment by abstracting complicated
actions and visualizing the process the
app teaches the basics of programming
without any coding or advanced skill
learning by doing has never been easier
just drag drop and hit upload that
simple we wanted to make a great product
and to do it we gathered the best people
from industrial design user experience
hardware software and game development
for the past two years
vortex has undergone countless revisions
and improvements and we know that only
through this process can we create a
product that won't disappoint our future
inventors
vortex is built on arduino an
open-source hardware platform it can see
and speak fine using infrared grayscale
and sound speakers vortex can find its
way around obstacles detect lines and
report back to you we've pre-installed
the program and done the assembling
vortex is fun right out of the box just
open the app switch it on and start
exploring vortex is also designed to be
highly customizable with colorful parts
stickers and maps
hello Internet my name is Kevin King
founder of plumb geek I'm here today to
introduce Ringo Ringo is a palm-sized
robot based on the Arduino Uno he's
perfect for any robotics enthusiast the
wide range of smarts and sensors we've
included will challenge and entertaining
even the most advanced programmers yet
he's still a perfect fit for anyone
taking their first steps into robotics
or programming Ringo ships with 10
interesting behaviors pre-loaded so you
can start having fun as soon as you open
the box you can activate and control the
behaviors with the included remote
control the light chase here ringo uses
the three light sensors to track and
follow the light the pretty blow is
coming from the two lights on its
underside you can make these any colors
you want the line follow here he's using
the edge sensors under his feelers to
see the line his eye flashes green when
the sensor on that side sees the line
the finger nipper here he's using his
accelerometer and determining which
direction he's pushed from then he
attacks in that direction the scaredy
bug similar example but he runs the
opposite direction when disturbed in
this example the gyroscope is used to
keep Ringo pointed a specific direction
even when disturbs wind him up like a
clock and let him go he returns to the
starting position pretty cool huh
after you learn how the sensors work
with the preloaded examples you can
customize them with your own personal
touch by editing our easy-to-understand
example code this is a great way to
learn the basic structure of how a
program works and to move towards more
advanced skills you can make him come to
life like he has a real personality he
drives around using a pair of pager
motors the tips of the motors make
contact with the surface on either side
both motors can run in either direction
and a variable speed this makes him very
maneuverable Ringo can determine where
he is how he's moving and where he's
pointing thanks to an onboard
accelerometer and gyroscope he can be
programmed to use these sensors to go in
straight lines and to travel specific
distances this control loop can be made
a bit sloppy on purpose which results in
a characteristic buggy swagger no swag a
bit of swag
lots of swag it's as easy as changing a
variable in your code you can show you
how he's feeling with six RGB LEDs these
are the same lights used in neopixel
products from Adafruit each can be made
to show any color you can think of and
they can be controlled individually
Ringo can see light from 360 degrees
using three sensors he can determine the
direction of light and shadows there's
sensors under the feelers that can be
used to follow a line sense edges and
avoid jumping off your table thanks to
an on-board TV remote control receiver
you can trigger and control behaviors
with the remote or teach him to respond
to just about any other TV remote
he has three infrared light sources
pointed 120 degrees apart which can be
used to communicate with other Ringo
BOTS appliances like your TV or use
together with the light sensors to sense
objects or movement nearby
