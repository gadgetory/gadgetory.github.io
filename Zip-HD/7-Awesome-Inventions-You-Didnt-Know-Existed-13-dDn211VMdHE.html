I was with my wife and bed getting ready
to say goodnight but then begin the
argument you're going to get up to turn
off the night that's when I had an idea

understand and now two years and 17
prototypes later meet Boca an amazing
invention just screwed into any bulb
socket and you have a whole new
dimension now on your lights will listen

switch will still work but there's a
better option behold focus which is bed

better experience in everyday life and

this is your bed you love to be in it
and you hate to get out of it your bed
is always there for you but is it really
smart enough to understand your needs
sleep is so important for your health
it's so important for your professional
life and personal life personally I have
sleep problems and every night before
going to sleep I don't know if I would
live well or I will not so I approached
my co-founder Max and they say look
everything around us is becoming smarter
and smarter but my bed is not improving
introducing Luna the first mattress
cover that makes any bed smart Luna
learns about you and improves your sleep
experience by taking care of you
throughout the entire night through its
proprietary technology Luna learns your
sleep patterns and habits and uses this
knowledge to manage the temperature of
your bed and communicate with your smart
home devices to provide you with comfort
convenience and security while you sleep
temperature is one of the key elements
that influences how long it takes to
fall asleep on its own Luna will learn
your regular bedtime and before you get
into bed set it to a comfortable warm
temperature which helps you relax and
fall asleep more easily while you sleep
Luna continues to adjust your bed
temperature with the option to have a
different temperature on each side of
the bed so both you and your partner can
set your own preferences Luna tracks the
quality of your sleep every night
including your sleep phases heart rate
and breathing rate so you can see how
restful your sleep was without having to
wear anything to bed Luna combines all
this knowledge about your night with
information about your day gathered from
other sources like how much exercise you
got or what you ate it uses those
insights to recommend what works best
for yours
