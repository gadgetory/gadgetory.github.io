firefighters trust the survivor from
Streamlight and now they have even more
reason to trust the survivor to light
their ways at Streamlight we take great
pride and understanding how our lights
are used and listening to the feedback
of those who use them their experiences
have inspired us to find innovative ways
to make the most popular right-angle
flashlight even better
we started by redesigning the light from
the inside out
we've reengineered the survivor with a
new optic design that has enabled us to
make the lens cap 50% shorter but a
smaller profile is meaningless if it's
self reprises performance we didn't in
fact the new survivor still boasts the
piercingly bright heat that has made
this light invaluable
it features 175 lumens a 41,000 Candela
or a beam that cuts through the smoke
and trouble-free Li 450 yards on high
for the runtime of three and a half
hours set it to low and get an
impressive 15 hours of runtime at 60
lumens with 14,000 Candela that sends
the beam over 260 yards down range or
select moonlight mode for low-level
lighting that runs for 20 continuous
days it even offers a flash mode that
can signal for up to 8 hours the
innovative optic design has also allowed
us to introduce our new smoke cutter
system for greater user customization of
the beam pattern both our black and
amber smoke cutter plugs focus the beam
for an even tighter sharper pattern
while the amber flood also reduces eye
fatigue caused by glare to help keep the
light pointed where you need it
we've improved our clip system creating
a stronger spring-loaded clip with
built-in d-wing that easily attaches to
belt and
while reducing unwanted movement but
with all the changes some important
features have stayed the same the new
rechargeable survivor fits all existing
survivor Chargers it's also available
with an optional alkaline battery pack
so you're never caught without backup
power when you need it most
the next generation survivor from
Streamlight smaller legs stronger cliff
greater customization options with the
performance you've grown to trust for
those who respond when I light it on the
line Leatherman is proud to introduce
the revolutionary Raptor medical shears
for military and civilian emergency
medical responders the Raptor medical
shears is a high-quality
state-of-the-art replacement for
traditional disposable shears and in
true Leatherman fashion it incorporates
a number of other tools specifically for
first responders it comes with a strap
cutter it also has a slot for opening
the o2 tanks and has an innovative
easy-to-use ring cutter doesn't have the
twisting all you have to do is clip it
in cuts right through right
and it also has the glass breaker on a
Kindle
the team at Leatherman work closely with
Special Operations medic firefighters
and EMTs personnel to find out what
these professionals wanted in Leatherman
designed Sears with that feedback the
engineers designed a high performance
tool built to withstand the rigors of
daily use when a medic is on side the
situation is already bad so you don't
want to make it worse by having a cheap
fear that's going to fail and break when
you use it that's why I let have been
decided to make the Raptor to give the
quality of a product that's going to
work every time for a lifetime of use
it's got a lot of meat to it it feels
durable I don't have any worries about
it breaking or become and go it work
through a lot that we put it through the
testing out here
Swatt night absolutely love it too it
does the function of about five tools in
one and does each one of those jobs so
well it's truly an amazing tool a lot of
my guys at the fire station we're
impressed with this tool size instead of
carrying many tools we just have to
carry this one tool built with the
superior 420hc stainless steel the
serrated raptor shears will make quick
work of various materials and medical
supplies and they can be taken apart
easily for thorough cleaning a lanyard
attachment gives you a third carry
option and the zytle handles not only
provide extra grip when wet but allow
for comfortable use in hot or cold
environments
another advantage of the Leatherman
wrapper is you can make a compact by
simply pushing the two button rotating
the handles down you can make it happen
side even with a wrapper closed you
still have access to the strap cutter
the Oxman wrench the carbide glass break
and the lanyard attachment a lot of
times small pocket tools are not easily
accessible with fire fighting gloves
this tool was easy to operate with my
expectation gloves my firefighting
gloves and my ems look once you put the
Raptor on your kit you need to prize how
often you actually use it it is
excellent for all aspects of mission
prep and everyday usage as well created
with input from professionals in the
field and brought to light by the
multi-function experts at Leatherman the
Raptor is built for the most demanding
conditions when every second count
Falkon line of harnesses is designed
specifically for rescue professionals
developed for Rapid Intervention choose
one of three models based on the type of
terrain the harness features a
semi-rigid and narrow waist belt and leg
loops to strike the ideal balance
between comfort and lightweight the
lateral attachment points also serve to
reduce weight and bulkiness all falcon
harnesses are easy to adjust by using
the double bag self locking buckles the
phone line leg loops can also be
fine-tuned for a perfect fit the gear
loops and carry tool slots allow rescue
professionals to efficiently rack and
organize gear on the waist belt the
falcon line of harnesses includes three
models the Falcon is designed for rescue
operations that require remaining
suspended for long periods of time the
medal ventral attachment point
distributes weight effectively between
the waist belts and leg loops the falcon
descent increases efficiency when
ascending a rope the dual ventral
attachment loops allow for a much lower
positioning of the Kuril attender as for
the Falcon Mountain this harness is
designed for mountain rescues the
textile tie-in points facilitate
climbing technique and overall mobility
Falcons lightweight harnesses for
greater efficiency
as a professional firefighter we are
charged to risk our lives in many
situations to save savable lives during
that time you have to place yourself at
risk
on occasion you place yourself at a
greater risk than you assume and become
trapped except inside a structure on
fire
conducting asserting conditions change
rapidly it's a high-risk situation
our conditions as such they cannot get
back to the means they came in
back in February 2005 the FDNY contacted
Petzl to see if her gris-gris belay
device used on the sports side could be
used with 7.5 mm unit rope and become
the descent control device for their
personal safety system Tim Kelly and his
committee worked with our product
engineers at Petzl to create a new
device that met their specification now
called the EXO the EXO personal escape
system is made up of an anchor hook with
a hitching slot a 50 foot seven point
five millimeter and technolo rope an EXO
a personal Escape descent control device
as well as a Nomex carry bag that is
fastened to the firefighters harness
today there are 40,000 firefighters who
carry the system from 300 different fire
departments from around the world and we
have been informed that the system has
been deployed in several fire ground
situations the EXO is the most tested
and carried personal escape system in
the world
the benefits of the XOR the payout which
was a firefighter crawling from a remote
anchor to the point of exit of the room
getting out over the edge and then
rappelling on it just releasing the
handle firefighter is able to stop at a
given point if they had to aid in their
own rescue they could certainly do that
when you're under duress when your life
is on the line you default your lowest
level of common and consistent training
so the key with the XO is it gives you
the ability to perform skills when
you're fine motor functions have
deteriorated under duress or because of
the environment easy to use quick to use
and allows a smooth and rapid horizontal
movement as well as egress when you're
outside the window we have 12,000
firefighters we needed to see that every
firefighter with a high degree of
confidence could deploy and execute the
PSS and perform a successful bailout
under high stress conditions it is a
part of my turnout gear and it can
valuable I don't go anywhere within a
structure on fire without the XO attack
you might die
just knowing that you have something in
the event it goes very bad having that
PSS for me personally gives a high
degree of confidence that have given
that I could get out the window and live
another day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
