if you're like us and streaming video on
the Internet you're either using an
external webcam a mobile phone or your
laptop computer
although these cameras do the job okay
webcams don't give you the professional
broadcast look we all love videos are
usually dimmed flat or a poor quality
what if you can use a DSLR camera like
this one instead of the usual webcam
there's just one problem
you can't easily connect your DSLR to a
computer
thumbs up Matt this is captured a simple
yet powerful way to turn a DSLR into a
webcam for live online streaming all you
need to do is connect capture to your
DSLR using its HDMI port and then to
your computer's USB port instantly
you're ready to start streaming
high-quality video with any app that
uses a webcam capture gets all the power
it needs from the USB port and works
with any app like FaceTime Skype OBS
livestream Facebook Live and others we
know DSLRs take great photos but they
also capture excellent video with their
large image sensors and expensive lenses
DSLR cameras can capture cinematic video
images like a professional broadcast
camera and because you can use different
lenses with the DSLR you can create the
popular bouquet of
with blurred backgrounds and sharp
foregrounds capture also has a 3.5
millimeter audio input port this is
great for connecting external mixers
microphones or live music sources it
synchronizes the audio with the video
from the DSLR camera making it great for
streaming live events to YouTube
Facebook or other video platforms all
image processing is done by cashiers so
it stays cool during extended use and
doesn't need a fast or expensive
computer to work capture is easy to use
and works with any Mac or PC with a USB
3.0 or Thunderbolt port we worked hard
with our engineers to make capture the
best and smallest DSLR capture dongle of
its kind we've used high quality
components and chipsets that make
capture fast stable and reliable for
hours of use with your support capture
will change the webcam forever and give
the DSLR a new role as a professional
high quality live streaming camera for
all video content creators ironing sucks

beautifully designed and comes in a
variety of colors we enjoy playing
popular switch games with friends and we
are accustomed to working with our cell
phones and our computers when we are on
business but running out of battery is
really painful for us even though we may
bring a portable power pack with us it
takes several hours to charge therefore
we have to keep it in mind to charge it
at all times
is there a power pack that can be
charged within a few minutes instead of
several hours now we have it Apollo the
world's first portable power pack using
graphene composite battery and USB DCPD
technology it supports up to charge at
60 watt which means battery with
capacity of six thousand milliamp can be
fully charged in twenty minutes or so
Apollo supports the power delivery three
protocol you don't need to bring a
separate adapter with you because it is
compatible with USB C power adapters of
Nintendo switch Apple MacBook Lenovo
laptop Dell laptop or HP laptop if you
have only old laptop chargers or MagSafe
adapters you can also use our any watt
adapter to charge Apollo
besides Apollo supports 40 watt USB CPD
output which means it supports the fast
charging of the latest iPhone 8 or
iPhone X or in an emergency
it supports emergency charge to your
Apple MacBook Apollo realizes
application of graphene composite cell
to mobile power pack for the first time
in the world on the basis of the same
capacity and the same charging current
the cell with graphene composite
material has much smaller internal
resistance and better conductivity
therefore the temperature rise is lower
during super fast charging so it is
safer and cell swelling and burning will
never happen
in addition graphene cell can
effectively improve the cycle life of
the cell substantially from 300 times to
10,000 times with Apollo now you can
play and work anytime anywhere with no
worries about charging
