the extractor pump kit the extractor
come from this poison from snakebites
wasp and bee stings mosquito bites and
more the pump acts as a vacuum which
provides the most powerful suction
available to remove venom from the body
by sucking it out the same cavity
through which it was injected there's no
need to use dangerous blades or knives
that come in less effective bite kits do
use the extractor select the suitable
sized suction cup pull the trigger to
its full extent and place the suction
cup over the bite or the stain using
your thumb press the plunger all the way
in until you feel the suction and let
the pump remove the poison this should
take about 60 to 90 seconds for insect
fights pull the plunger up to gently
release the vacuum for snakebites
Center a suction cup over one thing all
the time and alternate between fan holes
every two to three minutes for 15
minutes discontinue use after 15 minutes
retrieving venom can significantly
improve treatment results most snake
bites occur in the extremities like the
arms lower legs or the angle and the
effectiveness of the extractor called
varies with the location of the snake
bite the extractor pump can most
effectively remove venom that pools
outside the muscle areas and venom often
pools outside the muscles and bites to
the hands feet and ankles in large
muscle areas like the calf the venom
enters the circulatory system much
quicker and the extractor pump is less
effective at removing venom in those
areas stings and insect bites leave
venom and poisons close to the skin
surface where they can easily be
retrieved best results occur when you
apply the pump quickly before fluids
enter the circulatory system however
mosquito bites can be treated
successfully hours after the bite is
occurred power equipment is proud to
