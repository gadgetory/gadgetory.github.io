hello my name's Tamara and I will tell
you why we've invented the vac uveitis
system everyone has experienced it food
that is run out of date or simply
doesn't taste very nice because it is
dry it out become hard or even moldy
did you know that this is mainly due to
the air around it so you throw the food
away and that's a shame it's actually
not the thing to do in this day and age
with honest sustainable products you are
able to prepare a tasty dish these
products deserve to be kept in the
proper way naturally everyone has a
refrigerator or freezer but not everyone
is using vacuum yet but with vacuum you
can keep products up to 5 times longer
and much fresher
unfortunately most vacuum devices are
not so easy to use they only work with
plastic bags you have a lot of noise and
do not look very pleasant in your
kitchen because simplicity and design
can go hand-in-hand we've developed the
vacuum by test system the intelligent
vacuum vital system works at simply one
button and it looks good in the kitchen
underneath the vacuum by the system
itself you can especially store dry
products such as crackers toast coffee
and tea but also bread
via the sensor you open the vacuum Ida
with a hand movement the system opens by
itself you put the bread in the vacuum
Ida and close the lid you hear a sound
and the let light will go on vacuum Fida
is working the system now automatically
creates a vacuum and your products like
safely and freshly stored with a hand
movement you open your back you vitae
and you're able to enjoy your muffins
straight away just as tasty as a moment
when you start it
what else can you do with a vac you
fight a system just anything that you
can do with old fashioned vacuum systems
with our vacuum tube that's included you
can create a vacuum in external storage
containers vac you fire coals these
external containers cover rows you can
keep all your food longer and also
fresher for example meat meat that's in
the freezer will get freeze burn in the
course of time and with our vacuum you
will not have that problem with our
cover rows you can keep your products in
the freezer or refrigerator up to five
times longer
