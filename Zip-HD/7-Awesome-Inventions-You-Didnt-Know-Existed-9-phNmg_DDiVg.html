replaces all roadways parking lots
sidewalks driveways tarmacs bike paths
and outdoor recreation services with
solar panels and not just lifeless
boring solar panels smart
microprocessing interlocking hexagonal
solar units no more useless asphalt and
concrete just sitting there baking in
the Sun needing to be repaved and
filling with potholes that ruin your
axle alignment on your sweet rad bro
these are intelligent solar panels
replace the panel at a time if damaged
or malfunctioning they're covered with a
new tempered glass material that's been
designed and tested to meet all impact
load and traction requirements oh and
did I mention that there are also solar
panels they generate electricity they
generate capital they pay for themselves
they keep paying more cuz we're not
gonna run out of Sun for like 15 billion
years that lowers the cost of energy
unlike those bills in the mail that keep
going up and it's clean energy everyone
can theoretically drive an electric car
with no pollution and a minimal carbon
footprint can you imagine how good our
cities would smell how much healthier
we'd all be excuse me young man am I
being led to believe that this thing is
some sort of thing yes it's a thing a
real thing and clean energy is only as
primary function I have a notepad
because this is where it gets
interesting for those in the north the
panel's use energy they collect to power
elements to keep the surface temperature
a few degrees above freezing they're
heated no more ice and snow on roads
causing traffic delays accidents and
injury no more shoveling your driveway
in sidewalk no salt corroding your car
or wasting tax money on snow remove and
you can ride your bike or drive your
motorcycle all year round whoa every
panel has a series of LED lights on the
circuit board that can be programmed to
make landscape designs warning signs
parking lot configurations whatever
these roads never have to have lanes
repainted just reprogram to whatever we
choose or whatever works best
imagine a highway road lighting up ahead
of you how much safer it would need to
drive at night there be improved
visibility for pilots landing on solar
landing strips these panels are also
pressure sensitive so they can detect
when large debris like branches or
boulders have fallen onto the road or if
an animal is crossing it can warn
drivers with LED text to slow down for
an obstruction I'm Barry you know
environmentally conscious good because
solar roadways use as much recycled
material in their production as possible
here is the next-generation quadrocopter
solution more airtime more payload more
speed and more style
my name is olga villager i'm the
inventor of year the quadrocopter
concept of the future septet sukham
the problem of today's quadrocopters is
very simple well engineered but not
enough power
and we have to find a way to combine
weight and power your didn't and that
MIT is impossible to do only with
laterally so smoothly someplace aku's
accumulators are heavy and you have to
recharge every few minutes even with the
most expensive devices you won't fly any
longer than a few minutes I so what can
you do you need more power or power of a
combustion engines here combines the
reliability of electric engines with the
power of combustion and shows the best
of both worlds here is the first
quadrocopter that takes the challenge of
carrying combustion engines controlled
with accuracy of electric engines the
result is power speed and endurance of
course here delivers all standard
quadcopter features that are state of
the art including follow-me mode
automatic return and automatic start and
landing functions
autonomous flight option and gear is
ready for industrial use but that's not
enough it's only a start of something
different
our goal is high tech for everybody
beginning with the air nobody knows
where we end up maybe here
ladies and gentlemen flight 1427 to New
York is now boarding at gate 3 please
hurry so you can find a place to stow
your carry-on luggage assuming you were
even able to carry it on and the airline
didn't make you check it because you
pack too much hopefully you all have a
blue smart the world's first smart
carry-on suitcase introducing blue smart
the first carry-on that connects to your
smartphone with revolutionary features
including a digital lock proximity
sensors location tracking trip tracking
information a built-in digital scale and
if that wasn't enough a built-in battery
that can charge your phone six times
over designed for today's sophisticated
traveler and even guys like this
pull the handle and the app will tell
you the exact weight of your carry-on so
that you never have to check it because
you pack too much god knows what a
suitcase has to go through
forget about keys or combinations
control the lock from the app and if for
any reason you need to part ways with
your blue smart or not it will
automatically lock itself life's too
short to fight for an outlet blue smart
will recharge your electronic devices
with our super powerful built-in battery
so relax blue smart will alert you if
you ever leave it behind or if it finds
a new friend and if it's ever lost
you'll be able to track its location you
will breeze through airport security
thanks to easy access to your electronic
devices with blue smart anyone can
travel smart
even this guy
as athletes we've often needed to track
our water consumption but solving that
problem led us to a more important
question how much water should we be
drinking drinking too much or too little
can be dangerous and the reality is that
everyone's optimal level of hydration
depends on a bunch of different factors
that are unique to you your workout
schedule age gender location your sweat
rate and even the weather are all key to
the equation in the past only elite
athletes had access to the tools needed
to dial an optimal hydration that is
until now
introducing Trago the world's first
connected smart water bottle
the Trago cap fits on any standard
widemouth water bottle and connects to
an app on your smartphone using
Bluetooth Low Energy
it runs on a commonly found replaceable
battery because the last thing you need
is another device to charge it uses
patent-pending
ultrasonic technology to measure how
much you drink with the toggle cap you
know exactly how much you should be
drinking each day more than that the app
automatically builds and adjust your
profile by seamlessly connecting to
other wearable devices so there's no
extra work for you imagine recording a
long workout on another app or device
and then immediately understanding how
to hydrate for proper recovery or using
the app to note just how much water to
drink leading up to a marathon or
football game
the trio cap also allows you to monitor
teams groups and multiple bottles
you
you
this is chip the world's first nine
dollar computer connect over composite
VGA or HDMI chip does computer things
save your documents - chips onboard
storage surf the web over Wi-Fi
play games with a Bluetooth controller
but wait there's more
this is pocket chip it makes chip
portable tape chip put it in the pocket
chip and you can use chip anywhere you
might have noticed chip looks a little
different than every other computer
because we built chip to fit into your
projects and we're so excited to see
what you can do with a nine dollar
computer
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
