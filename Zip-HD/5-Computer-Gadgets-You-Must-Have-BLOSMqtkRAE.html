privacy and security to your
internet-connected devices keeping your
web activity private the way it should
be your smart phone has your whole life
on it it's your point of connection to
the people and the world around you it's
also an incredibly powerful computer the
speed and power of our smart phones
rarely hold us back for the small screen
and limited interface often do that's
why we created the super book a simple
plug-and-play device that turns your
Android smartphone into a beautiful
laptop computer just connect your phone
to the super book using a USB cable the
super book provides the keyboard
multi-touch trackpad and
and your smartphone brings the computing
power along with your files and apps and
of course the Superbook can use your
smartphone's data Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
connectivity the Superbook has over
eight hours of battery life and it even
charges your smartphone
it works with all modern Android devices
and it's future proof when you get a new
smartphone
you'll still work with your Superbook
it's like getting a brand-new laptop
every time you upgrade starting at just
$99 the Superbook is a fraction of the
cost of a traditional laptop and it's
even more convenient hi I'm Andrew
co-founder of and roam iam makers of the
Superbook I was frustrated with having
such a powerful smartphone but with an
interface designed purely for mobile use
our goal of the Superbook is to
eliminate the restrictions that hold
smartphones back the software side of
the Superbook Avenger omean and apps
that makes Android function like a
familiar desktop operating system you
get a mouse cursor keyboard shortcuts
desktop class browsing and easy file
management everything is intuitive and
optimized for productivity there's no
custom firmware to install and no
technical knowledge needed simply
download the apps from the Play Store
and connect to your Superbook you can
use one of our native apps or any of the
millions of Android apps in the Play
Store we're also introducing an open SDK
to enable developers to add in chromium
optimization to the apps we've already
released a beta version of and roam you
in the Play Store where it's received
hundreds of thousands of downloads and
extremely positive reviews the Swift
point GT is the first Mouse in the world
to give smooth panning and flicking
without having to reach for the screen
it opens up touch to Windows 7 and fully
touch enabled systems like Windows 8 and
10 just come alive you can use the GT on
your desk like a traditional Mouse but
unlike other mice it's designed to
operate on your laptop next to your
touchpad so whether you're on a plane or
a train or in the living room you can
always use the GT and be 100% productive
the GT offers two modes of use there is
a point-and-click mode just
traditional Mouse then there is the
touch gesture mode tilt the GT over
slightly to touch the stylus and windows
8 and 10 now see it as a finger moving
on a touchscreen Windows 8 and 10 apps
are all about tiles designed to be moved
sideways with your finger there are
nightmare to use with a scroll wheel the
GT supports native touch so we can
intuitive leap an and flick smoothly
left and right the new web browser has
great features - but only for a
touchscreen with the GT you can flick
back to a previous web page read through
the page with the scroll wheel and then
flick back to the top with the new start
screen and Windows 10 preview you can
use the power of a mouse and touch to
easily open and switch between apps that
now open in smaller windows windows 8
and 10 suddenly makes sense and actually
become pretty awesome the latest
versions of Word and Excel are also
touch optimized and with the GT you can
flick and pan your way straight to the
section you need and in Excel you can
instantly go over to the column you need
to view or edit no other mouse is this
fast and intuitive for navigating
documents it takes you to a new level of
productivity we also support all the
other touch features like zooming and
application switcher if you're using
Windows 7 Android Mac OS or even an iPad
we haven't forgotten about you just
check out our other videos below
with other small mobile mice you need to
use a clogged river which soon causes
cramping in your fingers the GT has an
ergonomic penlight grip that is
comfortable in anyone's hands large or
small it's 30 to 40 percent more
efficient and more accurate than a
touchpad you can connect via bluetooth 4
or the USB receiver which also charges
the mouse
in some situations paper will always be
best for unleashing our creativity and
sometimes we just need technology
choosing between paper and computer is a
matter of context today we can have the
best of both worlds the pump is the
first ever connected pocket scanner it
is mobile tiny lightweight Wireless with
a long-lasting battery the part is very
simple to use thanks to its unique
button it is smart it automatically
takes care of every step from sheet of
paper to its destination on the Internet
the pump allows you to stay comfortable
where you are without moving around you
don't need to worry about paper
dimensions anymore your documents are
automatically and safely routed where
you need them the pop is so simple to
use choose your scenario fit the laser
to the pages and press the button that's
it your document has just been
transferred according to your choice
so much works madam organizer they
deserves to be synced and shared
instantly with your love life the pub is
always ready to go
it's the Cremonese fast and easy to use
the product will be closer to the ones
you love the tops can scan everything it
even works with books it's not and
automatically fixes any reflection or
page curve issues the pop comes with its
own light and does not rely on the
ambient light you always get a sharp
image the pub is your Nomad companion it
follows you everywhere it takes care of
everything then you focus of what really
matters to you the pups will bring you
new creative scenarios every day
certainly will stay up-to-date of your
favorite networks Facebook Pinterest
Instagram they can be reached in one
click it even helps you import your
documents into Word and Excel the foot
point Z is the world's first gaming
mouse that leaches pivot tilt and roll
while most mice live in a little playing
field of the X&amp;amp;Y plane this map if you
left off under the z axis we've also
invented a brand new way of clicking
buttons it means you can access dozens
of different pattern actions while
barely moving your fingers and a Z even
though how hardly clips or tactile
feedback we built in an accelerometer
gyroscope linear actuator and pressure
sensors to unleash what we say will be
the biggest leap forward and mouse
technology and it was first invented 50
years ago whether you're a gamer and
design or even a power desktop user so Z
will need to interact with your computer
in a faster more precise and highly
intuitive way the Z is the first Gaming
Mouse that lets you pivot tilt and roll
it knows when it's on the table and when
it's in the air bringing a whole new
dimension of control to the mouse with
the mouse on the surface you can tilt
left and right for fast mode changes
without using your fingers you can
assign any action to tilt like leaning
crouching or reloading or use it as a
modifier key on the mouse button
and keyboard without actually having to
press a key when playing a game that
involves driving use help to take the
wreck and alone control of a steering
wheel
we've designed adjustable replaceable
feet that can make the tilt easier or
harder or set a large or small tilt
angle or you can lock our tilt
altogether so Z also knows when the
mouth is pivoting left or right this
gives you a huge competitive advantage
and many first or third person shooters
you can run straight ahead and at the
same time look left and right with
analog control the same way as you would
with a VR headset it provides tactile
feedback so you know when you're facing
forward or looking to the side just like
tilt you can assign any action or modify
to a pivot everything is configurable
but in the inner gestures lift the mouse
off the surface now you have to wreck
analog controllers pitch roll and yaw
use this to the ultimate control in
flight films for the direct camera
controlling spectator mode many mice
pack in additional buttons around the
thumb grip and all over the device but
we figured out a new way of clicking
that means you can have more buttons and
they are effortless to click those
finger or thumb contortions required
we've created something we call split
finger clicking and our test users just
love it Suzy has a new type of trigger
buttons that can be used by simply
straightening your finger slightly and
then clicking all while you're still
gripping the mouse is normal with your
fingers poised on the main left and
right click buttons they are so easy to
click that you can use them for actions
you do also like reloading jumping or
crouching we call them trigger buttons
because you can actually pull them like
a trigger as well these two buttons are
in effect four buttons
we've also added adjustable fingertip
buttons that can be accessed with very
little finger movement
combined pivot and tilt with trigger and
finger to button if it's Leslie access
48 single click actions while barely
moving your fingers needless to say the
Z makes the ultimate in in a mouse in a
game like World of Warcraft you can also
use tilt left or right to easily switch
between action bars and access different
skills the trigger buttons and fileted
button positions are all suitable and
the Z even knows how hard you click we
call it deep click you configure the
amount of force that since you and the
Zegers you tactile feedback and that you
know it activate it you can also use the
click in an analog mode to have directs
level control or speed when driving
flying or running in a first-person
shooter right click to bring up your
scope click deeper to zoom in then
deeper again to hold your breath and
fill your sights now take the shot for
games that have light and heavy attacks
use normal click for a light attack or
say Kannada to launch a heavy attack and
we didn't stop there we also want to
make the most economic multifunctional
mouse in the world
we know that gamers don't want to worry
about batteries or wireless reliability
and latency so while we made it wired
we also eliminated the issue of cable
drag by building a brushed aluminum cube
into the mouth net for perfect
positioning of the course right off a
desk surface we wanted to make the Z Z
easiest mouth to configure we added an
OLED screen and enter Z knows its
orientation lifting it to look at the
screen automatically puts it into
configure mode to swiftly change
profiles or dpi we trialed hundreds of
prototype to reach what we believe is
the best shape math
ever built the main clip doesn't have
been flattened so that when you click
you are opposing a disk surface with no
chance of nudging the mouse and we've
balanced the mouse so that when you lift
it
the weight is evenly distributed between
your thumb ring and little finger we've
integrated the latest state-of-the-art
gaming sensor the pic start
pmw 3d 360 from 200 CPI to 12,000 CPI
and max acceleration of 50g and of
course we have the glowing RGB LED</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
