it's perfect
we notice but we spend 90% of our time
indoors where air can be five times more
polluted it's not just pollen pet dander
and dust but it's microscopic pollutants
like mold gaseous chemicals bacteria and
viruses that cause us the most harm
these pollutants get trapped indoors
where they accumulate concentrate and
multiply current air filters try to
catch pollutants but can't eliminate
them it's time for a new approach
introducing molecule the world's first
molecular air purifier molecule doesn't
capture pollutants it destroys them
as air passes through molecule light
excites a nano coated filter where
pollutants are deconstructed at a
molecular level turning them into
harmless elements that are supposed to
be in the air
surround yourself with the air you were
meant to breathe damn Guardian air
purifiers feature a powerful combination
of filters and UVC light the trap
particles that can cause asthma
allergies and holes while fighting
bacteria in mold
to help you breathe easy the germ
guardian three-in-one tower air cleaning
system provides multiple layers of
cleaning a true HEPA combination filter
captures up to ninety nine point ninety
seven percent of airborne particles as
small as quite three microns including
dust mites debris mold spores pollen and
pet dander a pre-filter charcoal air
captures larger particles for reducing
hustled odors and the power of UVC light
kills germs and bacteria standing at 22

every minute of the day our megas unique
smart mode allows it to automatically
change its settings based on the air
quality around it in smart mode air mega
will automatically adjust its fan speed
according to the air quality of the room
when indoor air quality is good the fan
rotates slowly
if it becomes unhealthy the fan rotates
faster to clean more air at a faster
rate in smart eco mode your air mega
conserves energy by shutting off the fan
when the air quality is good for 10
minutes or more if the pollution sensor
detects particles in the air the fan
restarts automatically while in sleep

to all living things from our first
miraculous breath the air we breathe is
something we count on a conviction taken
to its edge in Sweden one of the
planet's cleanest countries where the
benefits and importance of clean air
have long been recognized so perhaps
it's not that strange that probably the
best air purifier in the world was
created here
swedish-born blue hair has become a
global success story by revolutionising
air cleaning technology and setting a
new standard for air purifiers today
blue air delivers clean air to hundreds
of thousands of customers in even the
most polluted areas of the world your
home is constantly being bombarded by
pollutants to dramatically reduce the
concentration of these pollutants you
need to continuously clean the air
effectively at a high rate the
performance of air purifiers is measured
in cadr clean air delivery rate thanks
to blue air is patented hepa silent
technology we can achieve both high
airflow and high efficiency with low
noise and low energy consumption this is
why blue air has won multiple awards
including for making not only the
world's most energy efficient but also
the planet's highest performing air
purifier let's take a look inside a blue
air purifier to understand how it
delivers such great clean air air is
drawn into the purifier and into an ion
chamber where every airborne particle
picks up an electric charge which
ensures that the pollutants are trapped
with high efficiency by the fibers of
blue air is naturally antibacterial
progressive filters
unlike the denser filters of our
competitors which inhibit airflow and
lower the clean air delivery rate our
unique electrical charge and gradient
structure filter prevents clogging and
reduces the amount of energy required to
push the air through
finally our ultra silent fan pushes only
emission-free air out into your home
office or personal air zone ensuring you
breathe air as clean and fresh as nature
intended bulu yars super efficient
scandinavian designed air purifiers
reflect the contemporary belief that
clean pure air is a human right so join
the blue air family and take a deep
breath of fresh life enhancing air we've
been very fortunate at IQ air we've been
able to change people's lives not for
some 50 years and the difference our air
cleaners make in people's lives is just
tremendous truly clean air has the power
to help people live longer and healthier
lives and it can make the difference
between someone being sick or being
healthy when we first introduced the
healthful plus it started a revolution
with the medical grade air filtration
and for the first time put it into the
home
this raised industry standards and
offered a level of performance and value
that has yet to be equalled as the
industry leader we always like to push
the boundaries of what's possible so the
challenge was how do you take the best
air purifiers in the world and make them
even better with the IQ a new addition
we've completely rethought the art and
science of clean air with the health
ProSeries we took the concept of HEPA
filtration to an entirely new level with
hyper HEPA technology now the new
addition takes hyper hepa even further
with more clean air longer filter life
and a lot less noise than ever before in
fact it's now the quietest
high-performance air purifier in the
world
the problem with ordinary air purifiers
is that they just don't work against the
smallest most harmful particles these
tiny particles are small enough to be
inhaled and absorbed directly into the
bloodstream
- results are increased allergies asthma
heart attacks strokes even cancer these
tiny particles represent more than 90%
of all the particles in the air
that's why IQ are developed hyper HEPA
technology it's proven to filter harmful
ultrafine particles down to 0.003
microns in diameter that's a hundred
times smaller and ordinary HEPA
technology most air cleaner
manufacturers make filter efficiency
claims of over 99% those refer to the
efficiency of the filter inside the air
cleaner not the total system efficiency
due to leakage that system efficiency is
many times closer to 50% iq air always
refers to efficiency in terms of total
system efficiency and that efficiency is
guaranteed at 99.5% this means that the
era turned to the room will be at least
99.5% clean because we make every new
addition system ourselves in our own
Swiss Factory we were able to
re-engineer the critical components to
reach entirely new levels of air
cleaning performance we pride ourselves
on only using safe technology will never
use technology that produces ozone or
ions
besides being potentially dangerous
ionizing air purifiers start to lose
efficiency as soon as you turn them on
they can lose 50 percent efficiency in
as little as one or two months and keep
losing efficiency over time iq air
filters on the other hand never lose
efficiency with the new addition we
focused all our attention on the two
most critical components in any air
purifier the fan and the filters the fan
is responsible for moving the air
filters are designed to remove the
harmful air pollutants the new addition
particle filters offer the longest life
ever new addition filters were
engineered with a greater particle
coating
Hemis owners save money because filters
last over 20% longer the new edition
uses a fan that moves more air with less
noise than ever before our new air
purifiers also clean er more quickly
than ever before and when you are
suffering from allergies or asthma that
can make a huge difference all of these
major improvements in performance were
accomplished with no increase in
electrical consumption the new addition
still requires no more power than a
conventional lightbulb the new edition
also offers the best gas and odor
filtration in its class the v5 cell
packs the chemical and odor filtration
capacity a more than 50 gas masks it
combines two-stage granular filtration
with the air flow advantage of its
v-shaped chambers one phase absorbs
odors and chemicals the other
neutralizes gases one of the greatest
challenges in designing an air purifier
this powerful and effective was how to
control sound but the new health pro
series not only moves more air it's also
quieter a lot quieter in fact we've
succeeded in reducing the sound of these
new systems by an average of 32 percent
this breakthrough makes the healthpro
plus the quietest high performance air
purifier ever made when you add up all
the improvements in advances in the IQ
addition it's amazing more cleaner than
ever
longer-lasting filters quieter than any
in its class we worked hard on the new
addition and think you will be amazed at
what difference it can make in you
