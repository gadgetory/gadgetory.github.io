smart clean mobile power it's a portable
lithium-ion battery with the world's
most comprehensive array of charging
ports and one of the highest total
energy output of almost any store
solution on the market it's designed for
everybody from outdoor activities and
indoor leisure to industrial
applications and emergency services
River releases you from the shackles
when outlet so you can power a free life
the unit is equipped with 11 independent
charging ports which can all be used
simultaneously for a total output of 500
watts to put this in perspective that
means a good power to iPhones to iPads
to math books a mini-fridge a lantern a
drone battery a mobile Wi-Fi unit and
stereo speakers all at the same time
without limiting the output on any port
with the storage capacity of 416 watt
hours River gives you more powers than
almost any battery at the time you can
jam on your electric guitar for 20 hours
straight or you can watch a 10 hour
marathon if your favorite TV show by
campfire river's battery can be
recharged in three different ways a
standard outlet or a car charger can
replenish the battery full capacity in
just eight hours with eco flows portable
solar panels River can be recharged with
absolutely zero carbon emission in just
12 hours the real-time display allows
you to monitor the battery's current
output power remaining capacity and
charge
being a documentary filmmaker a lot of
my shoots happen outside a lot of times
our locations are way out in the middle
of nowhere first time I use River I was
really surprised at how much these
little units can accomplish on location
everything runs on batteries we have to
set up a DI T station battery charging
station and we could even run our LEDs
when we need extra light never have to
worry about the noise and the pollution
of a generator applications for battery
power are endless River isn't just an
accessory it's your power companion for
harnessing clean energy anywhere so
you're free to go everywhere this
patented shark deterrent technology has
been tested in research for years and we
stand behind our products 100% we
believe in it so much we're willing to
get the water with the sharks ourselves
just to prove it to you
watch what happens for our first test we
were able to come up Caribbean reef
sharks pretty large ones actually
in order to be not only really
scientifically safe at the same time we
actually tried the shark band to rope
added bullying and as the Sharks for
frenzied in feeding we were able to
throw that into the water right in the
area where the shark competing and when
they came up to investigate the shark
man they played so in the second test it
was really quite exciting I actually put
the shark bands around both ankles and
got into the water with the sharks and
when I was in there we were fading the
Sharks and chumming all around and as
the Sharks approached me notice obvious
repellent reactions as they approached
the bands on my feet
during the third test we decided to get
more of the controlled type of testing
so we actually took a lead weight and
wrap the sharp bands around that again
put it in the water and Chum the Sharks
to the surface and when we did that we
had some really astonishing compelling
behavior and I think that was awesome I
think this product will be very
effective for the recreational Beach
coder someone who's swimming in a beach
environment where it's no shallow water
and a shark comes through investigating
and using its electrical sense in those
types of situations I think this
particular advice will be very effective
at repelling a shark I may even have
very strong applications will somebody
send out on a surfboard
dangling off the edge and a shark comes
through you're curious in investigating
I think the little build implement meet
the next generation of fire with the
camp stove to a portable wood-burning
stove that creates smokeless flames
while generating usable electricity so
you can cook your meals and charge your
devices all at the same time now is
updated thermoelectrics the camp stove
to provides 50% more power than the camp
stove one and incorporates an onboard
battery you can store your electricity

what's going on inside and features for
fan speeds to control the size of your

discover a smarter cleaner campfire with
the camp goes to part of the bio light
energy ecosystem in any outdoor activity
hydration is absolutely critical we are
excited to introduce the most innovative
hydration product of the year and our
patent-pending solution to this problems
without your hydration impious infuses
an easy-to-use in-line flavoring system
that attaches the end of any existing
hydration pack without any sort of
cutting or damage you can create pure
water or switch to electrolytes and
flavor with the turn of the dial the way
infuse works is by our patented venturi
and rolling steel design when suction is
applied the diaphragm pulls water at the
same time this rolls the seals away from
the pork and infuses your water with the
perfect mix of flavor as soon as you
release suction the diaphragm snaps shut
and the seals roll back in place not to
mention that you can change the
cartridges at any time they are 100%
refillable with any water enhancer you
already love with infuse there's no
cleanup no flavor staining just flavor
and electrolytes or water exactly how
and when you want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
