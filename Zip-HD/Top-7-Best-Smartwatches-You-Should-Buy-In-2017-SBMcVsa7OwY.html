first watch with a smart notification
center called daga damn huh it is going
to prioritize everything according to
your preferences my first impression of
the take wise tool is it fits great and
it looks good on my wrist each little
point that you touch it's very specific
and I like how it goes from being a
traditional type function looking down
at it to being able to interact with my
first impression was that it was a neat
watch but outside of that I didn't
really know that I'd explore the
functionality or could be use it in the
real world
you
normally I wouldn't consider answering
any phone calls while I'm riding my bike
but with the tick watch - you just flip
your wrist twice answer the call with
another two times and hang it up it
tracks my workout and it fits with my
lifestyle I'm not really what you call
tech savvy but the tick watch juice and
really easy to use okay if you go we
want sushi I can ask it to find a nearby
restaurant and it shows the reading and
the review and how far away it is
whenever I want to go for a run I can
always track all my fitness goals on it
it's really important for me to be able
to track how I want to do my workout if
I want to use it by calories or with
distance or based on my heart rate I was
really impressed without convenient it
was the scheduled tasks and meetings
that responded my voice commands very
easily
okay Kiko schedule a meeting with Bob
Williams for 7:00 a.m. tomorrow I
thought was pretty awesome that you call
an uber by just saying : Eber in your
watch and it would request one for you
it's a great to be able to focus on the
tasks I have at hand and instead of
happen to check my phone all the time I
receive the text I simply glance at my
watch
I can't dismiss it until I'm ready to
respond later you know I don't see how
I've really been able to function
without it it really helped me be more
efficient it's made my life a lot easier
when it comes to my workouts or even
just my daily life
okay Pico how's the weather when I'm
selecting a watch it actually matters to
me
how it looks it's cute I like it overall
I was really impressed with what take
walks to you it's fast it's intuitive
it recognizes my voice faster than the
other SmartWatch have ever seen so I get
to keep this right
introducing Starbucks the first for
watch with integrated walkie-talkie
especially designed for outdoor
activities invented during the Second
World War
walkie talkies have always looked heavy
and bulky designed for functions are not
for aesthetic we wanted to change them
and develop a product that is different
a walkie talkie that is small enough to
fit into a SmartWatch without
compromising on the technical features
and design
if you're an outdoor enthusiast you know
the situation you do not have cell phone
signal what it's just not convenient to
dial numbers or open act sometimes it's
just easier to have just a button to
push and calm communication is important
you don't want to get lost when you're
leaving your comfort zone and trying to
discover new area Starbucks is not just
a walking costume but a carwash design
for an outdoor sport enthusiast star box
comes with a lot of features useful for
your daily life and improving your
security
it's important for us to build up a
community of like-minded people so we
have included and after sharing your
experience with Starbucks Starbucks is
compatible with other walking options
and can also help to spread your message
to a group of people we are a team of
outdoor sports and it happened and we
got lost in nature you like to travel to
the untouched parts of nature and found
out there were a lot of places with no
bones so we wanted to create something
that helps us in this situation still is
convenient in daily life and not heavy
to care
engineering and design with a big
challenge we wanted to bring the
technology into such a small gadget and
had to find a solution to implement the
antenna in the wristband we have been
working with different suppliers for the
housing and electronics and trying to
modify details again and again
now we are ready to bring Starbucks a
lie please support us today meet waffle
a cool kid SmartWatch that keeps them
safe while they have fun
the watch is packed with Sun features
for kids and useful safety features for
the parents from the moment they wake up
and decide what they want to wear for
the day
the watch becomes a part of their
identity that they wear every day the
primary feature for the kids is the
customization of their watch to
encourage their creativity they can
match their clothes color by customizing
the waffle band and their watch face the
primary feature for the parents is its
location tracking ability the watch can
locate your child in real time anywhere
in the world the tracker also has the
ability to add a designated taste own
simply tell the watch where the kids are
allowed to go it's the safe zone is
breached simply call the watch and find
out what's happened
kids love socializing and so does the
watch with its DSS feature simply shake
the watches together and they instantly
connect just now the kids can share
voice messages and voice calling
together the waffle is big on safety so
much so we designed to take me home
function if your child is lost they
press the take me home button and
they're given simple directions to get
home
and on their way home if they want to
speak to you or see something they want
to share they can call you via their
watch and you don't have to worry about
the cost of the call because the Wasel
uses voice technology so when calls are
made there are no extra cost to the
package and if the kids need any help
they can press the SOS button using this
button tells the watch to call the
primary contact and if they don't answer
it tries another contact if no one
answers the watch will keep calling
until a contact does answer there are
many additional features such as an
alarm to tell the parents if the battery
is getting low a watch off alarm voice
messaging and emoticon sticker an
exercise tracker a group chat and their
journal history plus it's great at
helping kids learn to tell the time and
keep them organized
we have created a SmartWatch with kids
in mind we've made sure it's durable and
consumes the lowest amount of power
design has played a huge part in the
waffles construction designed by an if'
design awarded designer and our
attention to detail ensures that our
user interface is super easy to use and
feels incredibly natural the watch
itself is comfy to wear because of a
high grade silicone rubber which is
durable and stretchable the watch is
even water resistant and dust proof and
this is Neptune pine over the last year
there have been so many new smart
watches appearing on the market but none
of them really seem to be living up to
the hype
they're usually sold as Bluetooth
accessories for its own either for
fitness tracking or as some sort of
Notification Center we believe that a
SmartWatch should be a truly standalone
device that's why we created nipson
Pines the only device you'll ever need
pine is at the top of the food chain
when it comes to smartwatches packing
more features than any restoring device
out there without the need of a nearby
smart phone just insert your micro SIM
card and it allows you to make and
receive phone calls and send SMS text
messages with 3G and Wi-Fi you can
conveniently browse your favorite
websites your social networks your email
and much more it's the complete wearable
web experience on your wrist when we
started looking at smartwatches about a
year ago we realized that one of the big
problems with all the apps had to be
custom tailors each specific device
we've been able to make our device
compatible with a huge number of
existing Android app so the fact that we
have an accelerometer the fact that we
have two GPS and all of these things
they open up a world of possibilities
for developers able to take advantage of
this technology is specifically in this
form factor it's really cool about the
pine is that we have a front-facing VGA
camera and a rear facing five megapixel
camera
the front-facing VGA camera lets you do
video chat right now we're the only two
SmartWatch spec to do video chats two
rear-facing camera let you take high
resolution video or still images we've
got flashes on both the cameras you give
them in any lighting condition and
what's cool about the pine is you can be
using flashlights or a heartrate monitor
with the existing application we went
through a lot of trouble to make sure
that the the connection mechanism was
released brutally that we can put it
back in and stay safe and secure and
it's not going to follow stress
and
