drinking riches leaves memories bars
aren't always the best place for this
beer is at its peak when it's fresh from
the tap what if you can enjoy that great
beer anywhere you want at the right
temperature and the right carbonation
trail cake lets you enjoy great beer and
great places wherever your trail leads
traditional growlers are great but they
lose carbonation quickly with
vacuum-insulated double wall design it
stays cold for a day and with co2
pressurization the trail keg maintains
carbonation for weeks the last glass is
as good as the first you can take your
favourite taproom to your house the lid
fits lots of growlers not just ours and
with industry standard connections trail
keg is the most versatile pressurized
growler system available mobility in
cities is one of the biggest challenges
of our times we waste a lot of time
sitting in cars and waiting for the
subway what if you could turn these
stressful hours into a daily Joyride the
mellow drive is the most compact II
mobility solution for the city thanks to
its distinct shape it fits on any
skateboard and recycles it into a
powerful yet sustainable ride as a
first-of-its-kind designing the Miller
Drive was a superior challenge we wanted
to create a singular product simple but
thrilling for the mellow drive we
combined the characteristics of a
skateboard with precise engineering the
magnesium unibody protects the
electronics and the battery pack inside
the regular-sized skateboard wheels
there are two motors that accelerate you
to top speeds of up to 40 kilometers per
hour
made in Germany the perfection of each
individual part of the middle drive
ensures for longevity in everyday use
like a normal skateboard truck mounting
the metal drive is only a matter of four
screws and a few simple steps
the user interface of the drive is just
one button and surrounded by an LED
display that shows the state of charge
the mellow remote as an intuitive slide
control can afford to accelerate
move backward to break with all
functions at your fingertips you can
also switch riding modes or check your
state of charge while riding and things
to the swappable battery pack the 15
kilometer ride can easily be extended on
the go no matter if it's a last mile
solution or even the perfect travel mate
beyond the borders of the city the metal
drive has the potential to change the
way we think about urban mobility
the track one opens up new possibilities
this is an all-season all-terrain
electric board for the first time a
track was developed with a
patent-pending tire like form factor
this allows for the board to benefit
both incredible traction of a track in
the fluid carving theory of the board
for the past 10 years we've been
engineering everything from drones
aerospace all-terrain and electric
vehicles and realize there's nothing on
the market that combined all of this
coolest tech into one portable machine
we used our electric car experience to
reinvent the track as you know it we do
everything in-house we imagine design
patent build manufacture and test every
detail all here at flux our dream was to
create a portable vehicle that allows
you peace of mind knowing no matter what
situation storm adventure or daily
transit demands you face the tracked one
will get you there our planet Earth's
rain is a force to be reckoned with and
only our patented continuous track can
cruise through whatever nature throws at
you
