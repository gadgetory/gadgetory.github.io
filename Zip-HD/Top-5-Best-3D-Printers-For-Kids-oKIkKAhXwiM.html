easy as you might think I mean you have
the ideas we have the motivation and we
have all the potential in the world but
sometimes you just won't have the tools
you need that's why we've decided it's
time to make our own tools so we created
yee-hah the only three printer design of
us kids in mind we made it easy to use
or 100% safe for kids it's controlled
directly by its cloud system either
online or through an expertly design app
there's no need for manually adjusting
anything you can create unique and
original designs pixel by pixel an app
or you can choose from an always growing
library of more than 2,000 ready to
print toys all you need to do is pick
your color Press print and Nihad does
the rats it's fully enclosed by a safety
door so there's absolutely no danger
when the machine is printed if the door
is open or the machine is tilted or
anything else goes wrong the machine
will automatically stop printing and
retracts it's novel Nihal is sleek
compact and see-through all around it
allows you to see our gears come to life
from any angle all four filaments are
eco-friendly and non-toxic and they come
in 12 different colors we wanted to make
sure that yee-haw allowed contorts for
their creativity in whole new ways we
can be innovative in our problem-solving
we could dream up new and exciting world
we can help each other learn grow and
achieve our potential and don't worry we
made it safe for grownups too
3d printing is one of these technologies
that can transform the way we make
things what we want to do is take that
technology and bring it to a whole new
generation of users and us that means
you know kids who are inherently
creative and love to make things with
their own hands we decided we should
make a fun looking 3d printer that's
colorful and non intimidating so we put
a clear shell around it and then we
colored all the parts so that you could
see which parts are holding the bearings
and where the motors are and how the
gears are turning all this is part of
making printer fun and educational along
with a really great tool to build your
own parts we've been operating full-time
for just about one year and we're really
excited about what we've produced we're
making every print year here in our
garage we're using a laser cutter 3d
printers and drill presses to make the
custom parts that we need and then we're
assembling everything ourselves by hand
printer is different than other 3d
printers because it was designed from
the ground up with kids and K through 12
education in mind you don't need to know
CAD you don't have to have a dedicated
computer in order to use Fortier all you
need to do is have an iPad and Wi-Fi in
your house or in your school and you can
design things and within minutes be
making them yourselves when we go to
demos kids are drawn to our product
because they can see that this is meant
for them it's colorful it's playful but
it's also doing something that's
practically magic in their minds
drawing is awesome designing in 3d can
be very difficult
what if making your 3d creations would
be as easy as drawing on paper we want
to make designing in 3d as simple as
possible so we're building a tool with
which you can start with your flat
drawing and from there stretch it
upwards bend it sideways copy paste copy
paste and tweak those details we are
calling it doodle 3d transform and with
it
anyone can express their creativity and
freedom even when you've never made a 3d
model before hi my name is Rick I'm one
of the founders of doodle 3d together
with my team we developed super
accessible apps for free D printing back
in 2013 we launched our first
Kickstarter campaign to develop the
total 3d Wi-Fi box to send your own
simple drawings from a tablet to a 3d
printer it was a big success and it got
lots of people involved in 3d printing
people make beautiful things with it and
based on the feedback of those users we
started working on a brand new 2d to 3d
app our new doodle 3d transform app is
now almost finished
you can make way more complicated 3d
designs with it but most important it's
still super easy to use total 3d
transform comes with a 2d to 3d split
screen with tools specific for each side
on the 2d side we have a fun scan and
trace function that lets you import
drawings of images and automatically
trace them to start as a base for your
design
you can also draw directly make squares
circles triangles and stars bright text
on the 3d side can pull your drawing
into a treaty shape you can tweak the
shape move things around or give it a
twist transform works completely
standalone or together with a Wi-Fi box
for wireless printing you can also
export your design to various 3d
printing services this way you don't
even need to own a 3d printer yourself
what if you could with a few clicks of
your mouse 3d print a toy for your child
in the comforts of your own home what if
you could create gifts for your friends
and minutes introducing the 101 hero
mini 3d printer the most affordable 3d
printer in the world we've worked with
the best in the industry to ensure a
compact and easy to use design simply
turn it on insert a memory card and
print anything imaginable the beauty of
the 101 hero mini is in its simplicity
all you have to do is download one of
thousands of lab tested g-code files
from our website
save it dear SD card and make it real
with one touch
we think that everyone should have
access to 3d printing technology and
it's for this reason that we've made the
101 hero mini the most affordable way to
3d print the hero mini uses a new
technology to drive the plastic
extruding motor and we've come up with
many innovations in the structure and
design of the printer itself with these
adaptations you're able to have the same
functionality of a high-end 3d printer
but for a fraction of the cost
meanwhile we've also worked hard to
ensure a safe design so the 101 hero
mini can be enjoyed by the young and all
the life the 101 hero mini represents an
entirely new medium for kids engineers
artists and makers
look good I made a cat a squirrel a
bunny and the octopus and I printed all
by myself kids today are becoming
empowered by bringing their imagination
to life
the excitement is motivating kids to
work together to be creative and to not
be afraid of mistakes finally we have an
educational tool that can be used almost
anywhere and the best part is kids love
it
hi I'm Nicole I'm an arts teacher I'm
happy to introduce mini toy it's the
world's first kid friendly 3d printer
it's cute it's safe and it's excellent
for the learning experience of children
and it's very affordable the mini toy
app has hundreds of different 3d models
so it's easy for your kids to find the
object they want to print creating and
learning has never been this fun I love
the design of the 3d printer the fact
that the mechanical parts a hidden makes
it really kid-friendly the different
materials like soft PLA an deflector
plate offers a variety of textures
making the learning experience a lot
more dynamic we also made sure that
printing is easy with OneTouch printing
we've been developing the prototype for
more than one year with our team of
dedicated engineers we were able to
accumulate two registered patents and
ten patent-pending technology to build
the safest and first ever kid-friendly
desktop 3d printer it's pretty cool
because you can make many things with it
and by many I mean almost everything
parents everywhere can feel better
knowing that their child can understand
and use this technology that's already
changing the world we are launching
minute high here at Kickstarter in
of that you can help support our
campaign by backing us we can expand the
stream community platform while in
supply the minute hi and create more and
more open libraries of 3d models for you
and your family and your kids can learn
explore and play for fun
