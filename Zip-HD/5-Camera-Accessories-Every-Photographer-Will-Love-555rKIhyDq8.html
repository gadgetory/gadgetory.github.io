hi I'm Daniel from engineer bowl after
the release of our product focus shifter
users requested an additional handle for
operating the zoom without follow focus
accessories lens shifter is a solution
designed for both photographers and
videographers lend shifter provide
smoother more precise focusing and
zooming photographers use lens shifter
to fine-tune their focus and zoom
quickly to capture that perfect shot
it's quick and easy to install and

precisely adjust focus and zoom red and
blue colors make it simple to
distinguish between each function using
the included balanced counterweight the
lens shifter stays in place when the
camera is moved and can be stored away
ready for your next shoot
I just gives you that mechanical
advantage and look at that that doesn't
move you can't make that move really

Germany's capital Berlin

DSLRs developing the unleashed we had
one big design goal it's tiny signs you
