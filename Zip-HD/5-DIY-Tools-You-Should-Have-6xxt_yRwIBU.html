screwdriver is kind of like the Swiss
Army knife of screwdrivers sure you can
zip in or remove a screw with these but
you can also light an area strip and
Bend wire and detect a live circuit all
in the palm of your hand the Hammerhead
4 volt rechargeable screwdriver as a
forward reverse ring that activates with
a simple twist once activated the LED
lights turn on illuminating your work
when not in use to spin the locks and
can be used like a manual screwdriver a
circuit sensor is located at the front
of the tool press the voltage detection
button and place the sensor within one
inch of a switch outlet cord or fixture
to see if it is live a light and a
buzzer will let you know if electricity
is present an integrated wire stripper
makes short work of taking off an
insulation sleeve and wires can be bent
using the bending slot on top take the
guesswork out of any electrical project
and use a rechargeable screwdriver that
just does more the hammer head 4 volt
rechargeable screwdriver
engraving the glass seems like a fairly
difficult task however with the wind
rotary tool and a win engraver it's
actually quite easy as you probably
already noticed this is a video of me
engraving a dog's face into a glass
plate keep in mind this does not take
any talent or skill if it did I probably
could not do it it's a great project for
Boy Scouts our art classes plus the
plate can be a very thoughtful gift for
Mama or Uncle Jimmy to the dog's late I
only use the wind rotary tool taking
advantage of the included select shaft
plus a round tip steel bit game graving
I first printed out a picture of a dog
and then taped it face down to the glass
plate make sure to take the design onto
the top of the plate facing downwards
that way all engraving occurs on the
bottom of the plate then go ahead and
start carving the winning graver works
nicely to make a deep pathway if you
have something with distinctively thick
outline like this penguin the flame is
hello you know what's up penguins once
you have a deep group created with you
and graver you can use the rotary tool
to deburr the edges so it's nice and
smooth if you're going to try this at
home make sure to wear safety goggles
and a dust mask as the small glass
filings are potentially dangerous to
your eyes and lungs okay let's check
this thing out and there you have it a
dog's face on a plate just like I
promised you like I said I have no idea
what I'm doing this is my second time
doing this so if I can do it you can too
man that's a good-looking dog
drill bits have been around forever so
at hammer head we asked how do you make
a timeless tool better introducing a bit
holder that allows for true one-handed
operation we put the strongest magnet we
possibly could on the collar of a bit
holder so that you can't even shake a
fastener off now you can climb a ladder
position a fixture and zip in a screw
all while having a free the bit holder
can be easily attached to any of the
hammer head impacting this with a simple
threaded design not only did we try to
make setting a fastener safer and easier
but the bits are made of a bi metal
construction allowing them to absorb
impact and last long I just love how
easy it is to use I can get a lot done
in a short amount of time since we
designed this tool with 1/4 of an inch
quick connected collet you can change
bits into snap I use it all times
it's the handiest thing in my full box
hammer head impact bit kits are offered
in a variety of sizes if it would ever
project you're trying to tackle don't
just work harder work smarter with the
hammer head impact bit kids you're
trying to get things done I think it's
more frustrating than working where it's
hard to reach or where you can't see
he'll now meet the cordless flip out an
incredible power driver
it's compact to get the tight spaces
other drivers can't yet drives the same
power and torque as much larger tools
but here's the real magic we flip out
it'll always come at your work from just
the right angle
flip-out delivers torque and power using
a design based on industrial robots
there are three pivoting joints the top
one pivots to reach in the tight spot
the middle joint lets you reach around
or over and the third joint gives you
all this flexibility with 360 degrees of
rotation the result flip out locks into
over 380 positions giving you power and
tight spots power in hard-to-reach spots
power where you need it flip out gets
the job done use a drill driver at the
wrong angle and you'll quickly strip
screws flip out adjust to drive screws
straight on and with the drill driver
you just don't have control for RTA
furniture flip outs variable speeds
which gives you the touch you need to
assemble furniture quickly flip out runs
on a built-in 8 volt max lithium ion
battery and you can fully recharge it in
just 45 minutes and even if it sits for
a full year flip out still holds its
charge and maybe the best thing about
the flip out there's only a weighs one
pound so whether you're working in
hard-to-reach places on electrical or
plumbing or just gained a powerful drive
around the house flip-out is a tool for
you remember the old adage measure twice
cut once
pull it hammerhead we felt like that was
a little primitive so we did something
about introducing the compact laser
measuring tool now there's no need to
measure twice just push a button once
and cut once
with the ability to measure up to a
hundred feet an accuracy within an
eighth of an inch
it'll take the headache out of any
project it's simple just point press and
it does the work for you with an
ultra-thin design it fits right into
your pocket plus it's so lightweight
you'll forget it's even there it can be
used up to 2,000 times on a single
charge then with the included USB cable
it can be recharged from pretty much
anywhere an outlet car or even a
computer use it to build those shelves
in your closets or to find the square
footage of a wall in seconds whatever
your project is the compact laser
measuring tool can handle it
one button one touch hammerhead extend
your reach</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
