waterproof knit shoes on average it
rains over 150 days a year
this inspired us to create a shoe that
adapts your lifestyle without
compromising functionality and style
whether it's rain snow or mud your socks
will stay completely dry over the past
two years we've developed a waterproof
material never before seen using a
proprietary knit blend and the unique
nano filtering process we created a
membrane that keeps the water out but
allows the moisture escape Bessie is
naturally breathable sweat wicking and
provides incredible comfort it gives you
the adaptive support with its tight made
four-way stretch

some tools never change
a hammer is a hammer a hairbrush is a
hairbrush and for nearly 150 years a
nail clipper has always been just a nail
clipper current nail clippers require
odd uncomfortable movements of your
wrist and can easily rotate or shift
unexpectedly which is an issue when
you're holding a sharp object
it also requires you to be able to have
a strong squeeze between your thumb and
your pointer finger which may not seem
like a big deal but degeneration at the
base of the thumb is very common among
people over the age of 50 causing them
to struggle with this pinching move and
when you lose strengthen that motion
cutting nails is one of the first tasks
effectively as orthopedic surgeons
ourselves we've become used to precise
surgical instruments built for ease of
use and accuracy we thought why can't we
bring this type of quality ease and
precision we find in the operating room
to consumers in their own homes that's
why we invented clipper pro its unique
swivel function allows you to position
your hand wrist arm and shoulder in the
most comfortable position for you the
double action mechanism makes cutting
your nails much easier requiring very
little strength to operate and our
surgical grade stainless steel blades
cut cleanly precisely and to effortless

game shells expandable memory slot she
can download thousands of more titles
online when Jackie's feeling nostalgic
she can also run emulators on her game
show unlike a slippery touch stream the
classic controller layout is perfect for
retro gaming or you could be like Tom he
likes to mod his games like adding cheat
codes or new character models he's even
working on developing his own game for
game show it's a prequel to Tetris you
can use Python C Lisp or any other
language and for makers like William
game shell is an all-in-one dev kit that
runs kunu Linux each kit comes with an
air MBA for an Arduino compatible
programmable keypad a 2.7 inch screen a
1050 milliamp battery and a stereo
speaker you can choose from six
different case colors and with our STL
file you can even 3d print your own with
game shells plug and play modules wolf
doesn't waste any time searching for
compatible parts everything just works
right out of the box then he just writes
his code on PC or Mac and he can upload
it wirelessly through a Wi-Fi connection
