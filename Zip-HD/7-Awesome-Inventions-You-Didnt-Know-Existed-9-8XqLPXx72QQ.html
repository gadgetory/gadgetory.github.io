there's nothing like grilling on a sunny
afternoon but it has its drawbacks
grills are dirty they're a challenge to
take on the go a fire hazard and require
constant monitoring so that you don't
burn your food plus when you're out of
fuel you're out of luck how is it in the
age of the microchip that we're still
cooking with the fuel of our
grandparents that's why we made the
gosun grill
a game-changing solar cooker that roasts
a meal for eight is as simple as cooking
with gas and all without a drop of fuel
it's easy to use and easy to maintain
it can bake oil and fry retaining your
foods nutrition leaving the rich natural
flavor the gosun never needs refueling
it's like having a power plant disguised
as a grill plus it's the first solar
cooker to effectively cook a meal
anytime day or night cook anything from
soups to souffles you'll notice the
difference with consistent cooking
temperatures throughout the tube the
vital moisture of your food is kept
intact leaving better flavor and more
nutrition the ghost Sun is simply a
healthier way to prepare a meal it goes
where other girls can't and stays cool
to the touch no matter how hot due to
the tubes nearly perfect insulation the
gosun can cook in even the most extreme
conditions and thanks to our
patent-pending face change battery you
can cook with the sun's heat even at
night
