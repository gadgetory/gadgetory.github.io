age 312 the first desktop mill built
with alloys in line why did we make the
h3 12 we made it for you the hobbyist
the student and machinist alike so that
you have an affordable true 3 axis CNC
machining option to suit your needs with
a fully machined aluminum frame table
and components designed to provide
accuracy strength and repeatability to
any project equipped with a custom
spindle the honing age 312 comes with an
ER 16 call it capable of accepting up to
3/8 shank tooling so you can take bigger
cuts in finished products quicker
manufacture parts and the materials that
you want to work with alloys such as
aluminum mild steel even stainless steel
in soft materials such as plastics in
woods
the honing age 3:12 comes to you turnkey
ready with no additional hardware or
assembly required the software's
beginner-friendly and compatible with
Windows Mac and Linux the trick was to
design a system that not only fed wires
smoothly and seamlessly without handling
but would continue to work just as well
when the spools were cracked or damaged
last year we finally got it right and
we're looking for your help to make the
wire box available to help electricians
everywhere the wire box has helped me
through frustration I don't lose my cool
with the product like just to get
tangled I lose it and then for the rest
the day I'm trying to recover and I
can't because I have to go down wastes
time effort you know the other stuff
needs to get done and if I have to get
that off the ladder waste time
untangling your wire off another product
I just can't I feel like I can't recover
it I know a lot of people came with the
wire box I don't have that problem and
pull through conduit and I'm done
modulus stress about it the wire the
cradle cradle in a box lock it up lock
on
get what I need to get back the wire box
would be the most valuable electricians
tool since the wire stripper leave the
debris school simultaneously regardless
of their condition deliver smooth full
of wire without things great not saying
you don't need an apprentice but if for
some reason he isn't pulling like he
supposed to don't worry the box is going
to assist them and probably take care of
it for him the wire box it actually
balances it out and helps you carry it
and a lot of times you know a lot of us
have back problems that just happens
from hard labor from time to time
the girl off balance you can be walking
like this with whatever you're holding
and it's just you know like all the
discomfort it's going to hurt yourself a
lot of times it jab you in the leg other
times you can trip over something so
it's just a fabulous idea
you know in the wire box event that is
your side and sliders and carry it
combined layer box is about the same
size and weight the standard toolbox
engineered just as strong the wire box
they take less time to set up you put it
in the cradle put it in the box and it's
protected you're done
go from there carry wherever you know
spot to spot lobster boxes musical in
and out of and it's convenient to carry
around the job site thank you so much
for watching and I hope we've earned
your support and Carlos RC inventor of
the wire points
laser cutting and engraving is an
outstanding technology to cut shape and
engrave a variety of materials and
objects compared to traditional tools it
is not just faster but also way more
precise our goal is to make this awesome
technology user-friendly and available
to everyone i Kickstarter we are the mr.
bean team you may know us from our first
campaign that some of you had
kick-started and this study laser cut an
engraver kit now we are back and with
the beam is not a kid anymore the next
generation of our laser cutter has faced
two years of intense development we have
made it even easier to use more precise
and of course more powerful mr. beam two
features a solid metal safety housing

plywood use your mr. beam to create
wonderful personalized designs start
selling them in your own shop or just
make gifts for your loved ones
throughout time Grif is helped to
succeed
making us the dominant species by giving
us access to tools in fabrication not
having enough grip can spell disaster
such as having your part moves slightly
resulting in an unwanted cut or an ill
place weld with grip being such an
important factor in fabrication why are
we still using such outdated and
underperforming clamps well our top
engineer has decided to take a break
from designing things like rockets and
lasers to design a clamp that delivers
the grip that you deserve our engineer
and founder created the demise clamp
this is a clamp unlike anything before
this is a clamp that's tightened not
with one of those toothpick sized
sandals but instead with the tool that
delivers so much speed and torque the
other clamps shiver at the thought of it
watch as the diamond clamp is
effortlessly tightened over 4,000 pounds
of load for the competitor struggles to
only tighten to about 1700 pounds with
all this power the diamond clamp opens
the New Horizons possibility
whether you want to catch a ride on a
forklift
so the stubborn web gap
crush them pack makers
the dime I'd clamp is the tool that you
need to get the job done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
