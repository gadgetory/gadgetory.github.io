lawns Barbara and Tom Stokes
it's a hard-working multi-tool with
thousands of everyday uses the
adjustable wrench jaw opens to a
half-inch for light repair and assembly
jobs a high-carbon two inch stainless
steel blade can be opened and closed
easily using the blade slot the
removable bit carrier is a high
intensity LED light and has two locator
posts and strong magnets to hold it
securely to the gup-e side the removable
bit and Driver are held securely in
place in the tail of the body the
stainless steel clip will hold the copy
in your pocket or gear and can also be
used as a money clip the carabiner d-10
will open bottle caps and metal jar lids
the gup-e is a versatile multi-tool that
is a convenient carry option for a
variety of everyday top Leatherman is
proud to introduce the revolutionary
raptor medical shears for military and
civilian emergency medical responders
the raptor medical shears is a
high-quality state-of-the-art
replacement for traditional disposable
shears and in true Leatherman fashion it
incorporates a number of other tools
specifically for first responders it
comes with the strap cutter it also has
a slot open in the o2 tanks and has an
innovative easy to use ring cutter
doesn't have to twist them all you have
to do is clip it and cuts right through
rings
there it also has a glass breaker on the
candle too
the team at Leatherman worked closely
with Special Operations medics
firefighters and EMT personnel to find
out what these professionals wanted in
Leatherman design shears with that
feedback the engineers designed a high
performance tool built to withstand the
rigors of daily use when a medic is on
side the situation is already bad so you
don't want to make it worse by having a
cheap chair it's going to fail and break
when you use it that's why I let have
been defined to make the Raptor to give
the quality of a product that's going to
work every time for a lifetime of use
it's got a lot of meat to it it feels
durable I don't have any worries about
it breaking or becoming dull if it were
through a lot that we put it through the
testing out here
what I absolutely love the school it
does the function of about five tools
and one and does each one of those jobs
so well it's truly an amazing force a
lot of my guys at the fire station
wearing frets with this tool size
instead of carrying many tools they just
have to carry this one tool built with
the superior 420hc stainless steel the
serrated Raptors years will make quick
work of various materials and medical
supplies and they can be taken apart
easily for thorough cleaning a lanyard
attachment gives you a third carry
option and the zytle handles not only
provide extra grip when wet but allow
for comfortable use in hot or cold
environment
another advantage to the Leatherman
Raptor is you can make a compact by
simply pushing the two button and
rotating the handles down you can make
it half side even with the wrapper
closed we still have access the strap
cutter the oxygen wrench the carbide
glass break and the lanyard attachment a
lot of times small pocket tools are not
easily accessible with firefighting
gloves this tool was easy to operate
when my expectation gloves my
firefighting gloves and my EMS folks
once you put the Raptor on your kit and
you surprised how often you actually use
it it is excellent for all aspects of
mission forever and every day use it as
well
created with input from professionals in
the field and brought to life by the
multi-function experts at Leatherman the
Raptor is built for the most demanding
conditions when every second counts
uline comfort grip knives are ideal for
many uses like opening cartons or
removing packaging materials such as
stretch wrap shrink film corrugated wrap
and strapping all comfort grip knives
feature rubberized handles that reduce
hand fatigue and allow for a more secure
grip users can apply greater force
without worrying about the knife
slipping in their hand
uline's h20 403 comfort grip
self-retracting knife has a unique
feature that retracts the blade when the
knife is lifted from the surface advance
the blade and begin cutting when the
blade loses contact with the material
the blade will automatically retract
even if the thumb slider is held in the
fully extended position the user will
not be exposed to the blade when the
knife is not in use or if it
accidentally slips off the cutting
surface
to change the blade move the red switch
on the side of the knife to the change
position push the thumb slider to extend
the blade all the way out carefully
remove the used blade and holding the
thumb slider in the forward position
push the new blade into the handle
release the slider and be sure to return
the red switch to the work position use
a sharps container for used blade
disposal all knifes come with one blade
replacement blades are also available
the hammer head for volt rechargeable
screwdriver is kind of like the Swiss
Army knife of screwdrivers sure you can
zip in or remove a screw with ease but
you can also light an area strip and
Bend wire and detect a live circuit all
in the palm of your hand the Hammerhead
4 volt rechargeable screwdriver as a
forward reverse ring that activates with
a simple twist once activated the LED
lights turn on illuminating your work
when not in use the spindle locks and
can be used like a manual screwdriver a
circuit sensor is located at the front
of the tool press the voltage detection
button and place the sensor within one
inch of a switch outlet cord or fixture
to see if it is live a light and a
buzzer will let you know if electricity
is present an integrated wire stripper
makes short work of taking off an
insulation sleeve and wires can be bent
using the bending slot on top take the
guesswork out of any electrical project
and use a rechargeable screwdriver that
just does more
the Hammerhead 4 volt rechargeable
screwdriver
hey I'm a par creator of the pocket
monkey here today to tell you about my
latest creation wild card the pocket
knife needs to a halt it's an essential
tool but it's bulky one more thing to
remember in the morning and it easily
falls out of your pocket is lost
I wanted something better I asked why
not put a pocket knife in my wallet it'd
be easier to carry and harder to lose so
I set out to design a knife to be as
thin as possible and the result is wild
color it's only two millimeters thick
only slightly thicker than a credit card
I was able to do this by reimagining the
blade pivot most knives have a pin
pressed through a whole wild card has a
pivot unlike anything in the world
I call it fly off technology the three
wings of the pivot allow the knife blade
to remain rigid to the body a necessity
when wielding a sharp tool for safety I
designed the blade to mock open and to
lock close the blade tucks neatly under
two blades argh
and it angles only on one ply so users
can't accidentally cut themselves when
carrying the clothes right and here's
the best part about this design the
blade is detachable I designed this with
the forgetful traveler in mind when you
go through TSA with your traditional
knife on you you lose your knife but
with wild card you only lose your blade
and on our website you can replace it
for only a few dollars with pocket
monkey I used a monkey to represent the
personality of the tool with wild card I
kept that trend going wild card as a
wolf cutout that doubles as a bottle of
the wolf embodies the nature of the tool
agile yet power
I wanted to pack as much functionality
as possible into wildstar's many people
misuse knives in place of other tools
like screwdrivers and pry bars harming
themselves or breaking the nine so I
added these tools to the knife I always
wanted to challenge convention because
of that I spent the last six months
trying to reinvent how this product is
manufactured every manufacturer I talked
to it was hesitant to produce such an
aggressive design the solution I kept
hearing was take this to China but that
isn't something I'm willing to do I want
to create products that embody the
American spirit of innovation and my
solution was to create a manufacturing
facility in Maine now we control every
aspect of production from laser cuttings
to packaging and shipping so we can
manufacture the highest quality of
product while creating jobs in our
community
help us make wild card a reality and
help us continue the American spirit of
innovation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
