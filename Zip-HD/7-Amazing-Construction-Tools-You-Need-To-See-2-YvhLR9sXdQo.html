can you do this with your circular saw
see how cleanly extracted this subfloor
with one saw one blade and no damage to
the sheetrock wires our plumbing one saw
what about this
forget about pulling out your beam saw
or making four cuts with two different
saws I could do it with one saw in two
cuts bet your saw can't do this how fast
was that and without the waste of
material or ugly edges that can be
created by reciprocating saw what if you
could do this
I just cut that rim joist without
marking or chalking any lines try that
with any other saw could you even think
about doing this with your circular saw
how many times would you have to pull
out your tape measure just to cut these
floor joists 10 20 times try doing it
without measuring at all and try doing
this with your old circular saw a you
have to do this by hand or switch to an
undercut so now I just rotate my handle
90 degrees for a perfect form pass under
cuts and only a few seconds now would
you believe that you could do all these
things and more with just one saw all
while significantly reducing
construction costs believe it
