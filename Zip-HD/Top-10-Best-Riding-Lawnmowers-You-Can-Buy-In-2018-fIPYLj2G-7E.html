at its core the MT V 70 100 s is the
ultimate tree in one machine riding
lawnmower rugged back roads vehicle and
portable generator as a hybrid riding
lawnmower the raven MPD's 46 inch mowing
deck can be adjusted to ten cutting
heights and can handle some pretty
sizable real estate and it's incredibly
tight turning radius will have you
maneuvering around some pretty tricky
areas most riding mowers rely on belts
and transmissions to drive the cutting
blades this waste energy uses more fuel
the mt v-- 70 100 s is an electric
direct drive system the gasoline motor
generates electricity and transfers more
power to the wheels than traditional
riding mowers allowing the user to get
the job done quickly and efficiently and
because it's a hybrid
it runs cleaner now here's where it gets
interesting the mower deck can be easily
removed by removing the power connector
and a few pin which turns the Raven MPV
into a bad road vehicle now we're ready
to roll and we mean roll up to 17 miles
per hour in either gas or electric mode
plus it has a TV style front shocks and
suspension so you can maneuver offroad
better yet you drive it like a car which
put pedals and a steering wheel and
let's not forget about that hybrid
function let's say you're a hunter or
maybe a wildlife photographer now
getting into the woods doesn't have to
sound like a stampede is coming you can
roll in silently under electric power
when you're ready to come home motor out
in hybrid mode and it recharges your
battery
save the best for last the NPV 70 100's
is also a powerful electric generator it
can supply power over five outlets for
up to 10 hours that's a really nice
benefit for those projects that are
beyond your extension towards reach now
you can have power whenever you need it
wherever you need it whether that's a
jobsite on the edge of your property or
simply a campsite where you want the
luxury of having electricity at your
disposal 7,000 watts of power is nothing
to sneeze at it can keep you on line
even after storm takes you off line
every once in a while a product comes
along it turns your head a product that
gets it right well today is that day
