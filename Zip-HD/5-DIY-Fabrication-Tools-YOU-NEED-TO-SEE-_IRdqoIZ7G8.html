own I ran into the problem all the time
of making measurement errors and then
cutting errors and the DIY I realized I
wasn't the only one having this problem
everybody makes the wrong cuts we
developed auto set to eliminate workflow
error in construction using auto set can
be learned in less than five minutes
first you make your measurement Auto set
reads your measurement and shows you
which way to adjust next you adjust the
stop to a rough setting and finally Auto
set makes a precision adjustment for the
perfect cut for professional builders
and remodelers Auto set impacts their
bottom line by vastly improving their
productivity for DIY consumers Auto set
affords the ability to work with greater
accuracy and precision than they would
otherwise be capable of my name is cat
and I'm a woodworker in Pittsburgh I'm
beta testing Auto sense you CNC router
equipment and I also use laser cutters
so precision is really important to me I
don't want a lot of waste when I'm
making something well you're supposed to
measure twice and cut once but in my
case it's more like measure ten times
because I don't want to waste my
material if I can get it right the first
time that cuts down on a lot of extra
time for me I take a measurement with
the Bluetooth Etape and then it sends it
directly to Auto set for me I love Auto
set it saves me a ton of time and
anxiety about making my cuts I'm much
faster I know that it's accurate before
I even get started
well installing building material you
probably know the motto is measure twice
cut once really it's more like measure
four or five times a couple times in the
place where you're installing the
material and then again a couple of
times when you're at the saw cutting the
material each measurement is an
opportunity for making a costly mistake
or gets me up in the morning is that I
want to make a difference
I'm Adam Staley with Adam Corp I'm a
remodeling contractor in the city of
Pittsburgh I've been doing remodeling
for 20 years the most part
how to get the faster you get the
project done perfect cuts and having a
wall that's straight that's what sets
you apart from the other guys
well the smartphone is an appendage to
any of this generation that is coming up
and working today it's just part of who
they are it's more likely that they
would have a smartphone on them than the
tools that they need to work that day
the learning curve on artists the ease
of use it's as simple as it gets
basically if you can read a left there
or a right arrow when they all line up
that's your measurement go ahead and cut
how much easier can it get if the artist
that was on my job site every day I know
it maximized my efficiency we've entered
the age of personal manufacturing but
when it comes to making durable things
in your own shop there's still no easy
way to cut hard materials as makers and
engineers we need to work with all
materials so we've built a machine that
could the first desktop water jet way he
works by combining abrasive particles
with a high-pressure water stream the
mixture exits the nozzle and cut through
the workpiece it's great for any
workshop because every material it's
compact and contains and it's digital so
you can make precise cuts that are
impossible to make any other way
as an industrial designer I've used a
variety of desktop application tools but
they tend to be very limited by the
durability of the materials you can use
on those machines but it's desktop water
jets we can go from design the component
to fitting that component and testing
within a couple of hours that's an
incredibly powerful tool as a jeweler
and an artist with the work I make I
spend a lot of time hand cutting so
right now I'm selling pieces sort of a
almost limited edition because I can't
physically output them not because I
want to be making in a limited edition
laser would allow me to not only make a
lot more but also to lower the price
point so they'd be available to a
broader audience I think you know people
tend to have their ideas constrained by
their tools and the things they're
capable of working with and having a
water jet cutter which has the ability
to cut a broader range of materials hard
material like steel and glass will be
enabling and make them think in
different ways and have them build
different things they couldn't build
before the future of manufacturing is in
custom local fabrication people will be
able to make things in their own
workshop that they can use every single
day
and will act like fabricating models and
prototypes is a huge part of what I do
but I'm using a laser cutter a TNT
router or a 3d printer for all of the
together but of all the methods and
tools that I use just one I've relied on
heavily over to you
and that expansion forming it's my
so-called secret sauce when it comes to
making three dimensional transient part
the problem is go back and formers
aren't exactly accessible they're
massive back to great equipment that
cost an arm and leg and there aren't
really any proper desktop versions with
them either
this is spackle for the world's first
digital desktop vacuform now everyone
can shape and form plastic like a
seasoned pro with vacuform smart
efficient and easy to use features such
as a exclusively design high performance
hybrid vacuum system that delivers
extremely detailed shapes and parts a
computer-controlled heater and thermal
probe the monitors of plastics
temperature in real time and a built-in
library of heating profiles for various
materials so you're sure to get perfect
results part after part after part just
alike the correct profile from the menu
press Start and wait for the vacuum to
switch on once it's gone all you have to
do is lower the handle bar and begin
vacuforming with a vacuform you get a
compact professional-grade vacuum former
without the hefty price tag allowing you
to finally get that bow rolling on that
business idea of yours or simply make
things for your own personal enjoyment
whatever those things might be whether
it's one of designer toys cause some
type of thing for bespoke gadgets
or one-of-a-kind art pieces
Harvey is a new kind of 3d machine
making real objects out of real material
we call it a 3d carpet everyone has a
chiller idea we've all same things
thought I can make that better or higher
quality or I could just make it myself
we want you to be able to make it that's
what created carbon we want you to be
able to go in ideas in its product in
under five minutes so we broke it down
into three easy steps first make your
design design software can be hard to
use so we made easel it's easy to use
and it runs in your browser the next
step is to choose your material with
plastic soft metals like aluminum even
circuit board pick whatever inspires the
last step is no matter what kind of
maker you are you click car
being able to design in a program and
have that same program connected to the
machine just beyond amazing your steps
involved has been cut down to mere
nothing not now the idea it isn't focus
we want it to be as beautiful as it is
functional to reach out the Scott Wilson
is seamless designers at minimum people
need to be able to jump in and use it
and quits thinking about the tool so
much and think about what they're trying
to do today we finally have a prototype
that we love it's beautiful it's quiet
its clean and it's just neatly on a
desktop but most importantly works great
we started this project project he had
two goals the first was to make a
machine it's quieter cleaner and far
easier to use and we've done that the
second was to bring the machine to the
world and an affordable price and that's
what I'm to kick-start with your help we
can order materials and components of
scale and start the manufacturing
process so here's the thing your support
for Carvey market is art but something
really special it's a new kind of
industrial revolution for people like me
and you can dream design and manufacture
the products that we've all met what's
your idea what do you want to make join
us and make your mark
industrial robots are too expensive and
hard to use however they could save you
time at home help you do creative work
or learn new technologies so why keep
these benefits away from you meet near
yo won the first accessible six access
robotic arm
near you one is a low-cost and
user-friendly robot made out of 3d
printing and open-source technologies it
was created so everyone can use it for
makers near you one can help you learn
robotics and be your perfect coworker it
can easily pick and place many kinds of
objects for example to automate a 3d
printer do anything your imagination can
create just by easily changing the
end-effector tool with Nerio one
reproduce industrial use cases such as
drilling or drawing on any surface with
any orientation
miryo one is great for robotics
education for students to learn but also
for children they can get to know more
about new technologies and get some
programming basics so much fun involved
near yo one will also save you some time
and daily light so you can relax and do
the things that matter the most
controlling near you'll one is so easy
you can teach the robot what you wanted
to do just by moving it with your hands
want to use a gamepad here you go you
can use the mobile and web applications
to have more control over the robot and
control it from a remote place near you
one will be connected to the Internet
oh and it means you can also get free
software upgrades and you can share
programs with your family friends and
other people around the world we
specially thought about makers and
developers by making most of our code
open-source STL files for 3d printing
will also be released you will be able
to program directly on the robot with
many api's and the source code it's a
great way to learn robotics and do
useful stuff with Arduino Raspberry Pi
and robot operating system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
