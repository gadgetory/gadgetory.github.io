we use it in every aspect of our lives
it enables us to do amazing things
but what if we could go further what if
we could go beyond the screen where your
digital world is blended with your real
world now we can this is the world with
Holograms
what will they enable us to do new ways
to visualize our work I have an idea for
the fuel tank new ways to share ideas
with each other I just put the images in
one drop more immersive ways to play
new ways to teach and learn so put the
new trap in the place of the old one
yeah
and tighten here and here new ways to
collaborate and explore the places we've
never been look at this formation let's
take a closer look
and new ways to create the things we
imagine
because when you change the way you see
the world you can change the world you
see
this is microsoft hololens why err a
Brody and I are playing first-person
shooter we're sitting there on the couch
driving this Jeep I'm on the back and
I'm pounding away with the gun and he's
hitting the bumps and then the thing
explodes on the screen we go flying but
there's really nothing except a little
vibration says what good is that like
it's gonna is something missing here we
started thinking about wow you know that
would be great if we could kind of get
that feeling across not only do you feel
the impact but you feel the spread and
you get the kickback and it's all there
the whole experience and that's when you
actually feel like you're totally
immersed and with air reg that's what
you get my name is Brody Stanfield I'm
the president co-founder of tech my name
is Michael Stanfield and I'm the vice
president and co-founder gaming today is
a two dimensional product experience is
limited to sight and sound and so we're
providing a new dimension it's a suit
it's a haptic product that provides
sensory stimulation taking the user into
the game whether it be sound sensations
of touch the idea of the impact Eric
will put you into that experience that
you've always wanted
there are three major components to this
suit there's the decoder the exoskeleton
and the sim skin the decoder is the
piece that attaches actually to your
console or platform takes information
then it brings that and sends it to the
exoskeleton the exoskeleton is now the
component that sort of has all the
pieces in airag that you're wearing from
the nervous system which is the feedback
to the control center which takes the
information from the decoder as well as
the power supplied to make sure it's
wireless
the sound that we're providing is a
patented sound it's quite a different
experience we want to make it a surround
sound feel so the idea is we have six
speakers two on the front on this side
two on that side and then on the back
one here and one here as well as a
subwoofer you're always in the sweet
spot no matter where you are
and as for like vibratory feedback right
now it's always been to the controller
so you feel a rumble in your hand now
we're actually getting it so it's
located on the specific parts your body
where it should be there are sixteen
points on the front eight points on the
side and sixteen points on the back
alright so first thing we're going to do
is I'm going to test this in vibrational
stuff so to start with I'm just going to
set a value here and I'm gonna be top
right you do that yeah all right so
let's switch that over to bottom left
and we're with you yeah which is
possible that's pretty much how
vibration works as for stims they're
pretty much focused on particular
muscles they can track some muscles they
can either give a full contraction or it
can be a slight contraction once again
same thing top right so they justify you
okay
shut that off how you feeling we can see
it moving your shoulder forward like
that yeah I nothing we'll wait alright
so that's pretty much it for the basic
fundamentals of what air I can actually
do so what do you think of it it was
pretty interesting and that really
experienced anything like that yeah
virtual world awareness you actually
inside the world that you're playing in
the last piece is the sim skin so Sims
c'n is the look and feel over top you
can then have these front piece plates
that you put on or an armor on the sides
and that kind of stuff to actually look
like you're in the game that you're
actually envisioning yourself in games
already have sound arity of haptic
feedback so we take that information
that's already there and we implement it
with air egg and it's now a matter of
the developers to take on that role if
they have a game and they want to
compete with a triple-a game and they're
only an indie company
well now you can it's not just about the
visuals anymore it's about how you can
how you can differentiate your product
we think that's gonna be a big
difference core effects is the immersive
gaming vest what our technology does is
what everybody else is trying to do in
the visual field but we do it in the
haptic or tactile search be allowed you
to seal everything that happens
the core FX gaming vest uses
award-winning 4d effects technology that
takes the acousto haptic signals or the
audio coming from your game and turns
them into incredibly precise
environmental and situational feedback
that sync to what's happening on screen
I used to code I used to write programs
my own games and you know having the
background of neuroscience I started
thinking about well you know there are
things that are being ignored in the
existing gaming community and that's the
amazing power of the brain to project
reality it's like right into your heart
so when you have for the first time as a
device that allows you to completely
immerse yourself in your media and
really feel the action and environment
the vest itself is Wireless and
lightweight and is completely
customizable in terms of depth of field
and the intensity of the environment of
feedback so you can fine-tune your
experience it's incredibly tweakable
with an assortment of variable controls
if you're playing an FPS you can set it
so that you can feel everything from the
explosions in the distance to the recoil
of your weapon
you even killed me you shooting it's
pretty good I love even like hearing
other people's bullets you can tell
they're coming from their left side
because you feel it it's definitely
really cool we are a multi-platform
technology we actually compliment all of
the existing technologies and including
the new virtual reality technologies
virtual reality is the next evolution of
gaming with successful devices like the
oculus rift and the Omni that are
changing the industry the core effects
vest is amazing on its own but when used
in conjunction with these other products
you can see how they all work together
to achieve complete immersion
it's a really different experience you
can just feel the kickback that was
actually pretty neat you feel not only
that when you're shooting or when you
get shot but also kind of when you walk
and stuff and it's pretty cool is pretty
impressive
then the future will have an SDK coming
out soon for developers what if there
was a video game controller that could
replace all the video game controllers
in your collection right now controllers
like this and this one that one of
course this that this and even one of
these okay maybe not that but how about
these two well we've made something that
can do everything these controls can do
and a little bit more and what would we
call a controller that can replace all
the controllers in your collection well
you would call it the all controller for
the past two years we've been designing
this controller by creating a bunch of
different models coming up with
different internal components and
external pieces to really get the best
features we could possibly fit in a tiny
package right out of the box our
controller has a bunch of different
drivers built into it so that you can
connect to virtually any operating
system on any computer you own and not
only that you'll be able to play any
video game ever made and when we say any
video game we literally mean that if the
game didn't have controller support
initially you'll be able to control your
mouse and keyboard directly from the
controller itself the all controller can
connect to Windows Mac and Linux and it
also has the ability to connect to iOS
and Android just use the built-in screen
on the controller to select the device
you want to connect to and then connect
it's just that easy
and that built-in screen isn't just for
connecting the different devices you're
also able to customize the controller
and a bunch of different ways remap
every single button every single
joystick invert them adjust their dead
zones adjust their sensitivity and
adjust the trigger sensitivity whatever
you want to do you're capable of doing
it with our built-in operating system
within the controller itself if you want
you can even set up the entire
controller to just do macros or setup
macros on-the-fly whatever game you're
playing however you want to play it this
controller will give you more options
than any other controller ever made
we're adding new support for devices all
the time through software updates for
our controller and those software
updates are totally free once you've
gotten the controller we'll be adding
new features as time goes on alongside
the all controller we'll also be
releasing the
allows you to connect to the Xbox 360
Xbox one PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4
and all of the features you've seen all
the customizability also works on those
systems as well everything you've seen
in this video is based off of a real
controller that already works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
