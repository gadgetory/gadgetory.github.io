the hyperflow micro filter utilizes the
latest hollow fiber technology and our
most advanced engineering to make water
treatment so small and so fast it will
change the way you travel in the
backcountry
it's ergonomic design compact size and
tool-free maintainability make it just
as appropriate on day trips as it is on
multi-day excursions weighing just two
hundred nine grams with a high flow
filtration rate of three liters per
minute the hyper flow micro filter is
the most efficient micro filter ever
created
the quick-connect bottle adapter allows
direct connection to all MSR hydration
products and a variety of other
widemouth containers and the advanced
pre-filter helps to prolong the life of
your filter before using the hyper flow
micro filter it is necessary to prepare
it for use
connect the inlet hose to the inlet hose
barb
screw the clean side cover from the pump
outlet and screw it onto the underside
of the bottle adapter cap to prevent
cross-contamination
place the pre-filter in water with its
screen facing down pump the filter with
three or four strokes to prime the pump
assembly and wet the pre filter the
prefilter works best when it is
submerged just below the water surface
when filtering and fast flowing water be
sure to hold the inlet hose so as not to
lose the hose and pre-filter
filtered water can be collected from the
hyperflow micro filter using several
techniques
a connect bottle adapter allows the
filter to be easily attached to
widemouth bottle fittings found on MSR
dromedary bags and Alpine bottles
the outlet nipple can be used to attach
drinking hoses commonly found on MSR
platypus and most other hydration
systems the hyper flow filters reservoir
spouts can be used to connect to the
narrow mouth fittings on the platypus
soft bottles hoser and other narrow
mouth containers such as disposable
water bottles
always choose the cleanest and clearest
water sources available when filtering
when possible avoid filtering silty
cloudy muddy or tea colored water that
contains visible tannins as this can
quickly clog the filter requiring more
frequent maintenance to filter the water
using the hyper flow micro filter attach
a clean container to the outlet adapter
or outlet nipple firmly grasp the pump
outlet with one hand and the pump Inlet
with the other hand
for the optimal performance pump the
filter at about one stroke per second
when you are finished filtering remove
the pre-filter from the water and pump
the filter several times to purge any
remaining water in the system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
