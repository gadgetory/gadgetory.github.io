two years ago my girlfriend asked me to
give em all bye so she could read it the
word which I did and then I got scared
scared because large cities are not
always a safe place to ride a bike you
have to slalom you weigh between cut
holes the size of a truck and the urban
drivers are not always the most patient
or diplomat citizens so what started
asking myself how could I make this
better for her and I made a list of all
the basic specifications that a perfect
urban mobility system would need to eat
you need maneuverability which means a
short wheelbase and a steep head too to
reduce your turning radius so you can
manage extremely tight corners a large
front wheel to overcome any obstacle the
city puts in your way a small motorized
rear wheel to increase acceleration and
climb steeper roads you should be
standing in an upright position because
there is a lot going on in the city you
need to keep an eye on your surroundings
and be able to get on and off very
easily it needs to be simple easy to use
intuitive and almost maintenance-free

folding bikes haven't changed in over 30
years they use small wheels and hinged
frames that sacrifice performance and
ride ability in order to achieve a
compact size they are heavy awkward to
use but worst of all they don't actually
fold that small we wanted to create a
folding bike with big wheels a bike that
looks rides and feels like a normal bike
but could still hold small smaller than
any other folding bike it also had to be
lightweight easy to use and
exceptionally safe introducing helix
helix is a revolutionary new folding
bike it has 24-inch wheels but one piece
titanium frames and a patent-pending
locking systems that is free of hinges
and clamps helix can go anywhere ride it
to work put it in the trunk of your car
for your next road trip take it on your
next vacation
we set out to design the modern whole
bike that didn't compromise ride ability
for size using patent-pending helical
hinges we were able to put the wheels
inside the frame and between the crank
arms helix was created using modern
computer aided designs and manufacturing
processes it uses the latest bicycle
technology helix improves on decades-old
folding bike designs in every possible
way it rides better fold smaller and is
safer and easier to use Manufacturing a
folding bike is difficult manufacturing
the folding bike that pushes the limited
performance compact Ness and usability
requires a hands-on approach and a high
level of control over the entire process
that's why helix will be made in Canada
we're a group of designers engineers and
manufacturing experts
we're also passionate cyclists our goal
is to make the best folding bike in the
world
we will oversee the entire manufacturing
process right here at home we're ready
and excited to go with your help we can
make it happen
you
