hi my name is Tom gray founder of the
handy camel my team and I bring to
market beautifully designed products
that provide outstanding user
experiences to make your life easier now
we bring you the renegade groom with
arch bristle technology the renegade
broom has a revolutionary way to sweep
with one swipe you get a far superior
clean and half the time of a traditional
broom the renegade broom has been a
best-selling broom in Germany for years
but the broom actually started out as a
brush in 1962 Heinz Fritz is looking for
the perfect brush to brush the dirt and
lint and dust off of his suit but he
couldn't find anything all the flat
bristle brushes it just like you see
with traditional brooms just bounced
right over the top of the dirt and dust
and lint leaving it behind on a suit as
an engineer he knew that the curved
bristles would be the secret to helping
remove that dirt of dust and lint from
the suit so Heinz Fritz in 1962
developed a secret technology that would
bend the bristles of a brush to help
remove the dirt from the suit this same
curve bristle technology that you see in
this brush is the same technology you'll
see in the renegade broom and the
foundation of the Fritz company
traditional brooms slide all over the
surface leaving behind dirt and debris
as bristles float and bounce over the
top of uneven surfaces the renegade
broom is a curved pull broom it's like a
rake so you pull the dirt and debris
towards you rather than pushing it away
by pulling it towards you the arch
bristles get more surface contact
picking out dirt and debris that a
traditional broom leaves behind making
it great for uneven surfaces like brick
stone and wood under normal use the
renegade broom won't flatten fray or
Bend like a traditional broom making it
long lasting and durable as you sweep
the bristles flicks and penetrate into
the surface to remove the dirt dust and
debris effortlessly it's extremely
durable yet lightweight and easy to
handle the adjustable telescoping handle
allows you to adjust the height to fit
you the renegade broom is produced in
Germany during the production process
every bromas and spear
several times by different workers some
production stages are handmade and for
others an advanced machinery is
necessary to build the renegade broom
and great quality using the finest parts
and components the renegade brew is a
perfect broom for the home farm and
construction sites making short work of
snow wet leaves and grass dirt pine
needles mulch and even drywall dust it
is excellent and hard to reach areas
like corners and under desks and work
benches you can even use it to rake your
lawn if you've ever tried to sweep out
the back of a trailer or a truck you
know how difficult this can be with
uneven surfaces nooks and crannies with
the renegade broom you can easily and
quickly sweep the back of a truck or a
trailer removing significantly more dirt
and debris than you ever thought
possible with a traditional broom the
renegade broom has sold for over $40 in
other countries and is available to you
