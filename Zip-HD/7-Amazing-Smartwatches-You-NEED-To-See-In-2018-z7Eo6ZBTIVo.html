from anywhere our team pioneered this
concept back in 2015 when we helped
create a hugely popular minecraft
wearable we know what it takes to build
a great SmartWatch but you'll want to
wear everyday I've been designing
wearables for over a decade
wearables is a very difficult space to
design within it needs to fit on the
person and be comfortable to wear
waterproof shockproof so we designed
this products using the best-in-class
construction approaches from the
watchmaking industry really what we were
trying to do was to create a physical
device something that exists in the real
world
that feels like it could exist in any
number of these sort of magical and
mysterious wonder lands that we see an
experience in every kind of game well
I'm really excited about gameband in
part because I'm a gamer and this is a
product made for me of course it's a
it's a full-featured SmartWatch but it's
more than that as a storage medium that
allows people to take their games to
their friend's home or take it to
another PC it's not a generic SmartWatch
it's something that speaks to a gamer
for me it's kind of a no-brainer from
San Francisco to Barcelona our team's
been working really hard to make
now a more supportive to get gay man to
production please check our Ward's
tobacco and help us

hi Cara to watch the changes with you
meet waffle a cool kid SmartWatch that
keeps them safe while they have fun
the watch is packed with fun features
for kids and useful safety features for
the parents from the moment they wake up
and decide what they want to wear for
the day the watch becomes a part of
their identity that they wear every day
the primary feature for the kids is the
customization of their watch to
encourage their creativity they can
match their clothes color by customizing
the waffle band in their watch face the
primary feature for the parents is its
location tracking ability the watch can
locate your child in real time anywhere
in the world the tracker also has the
ability to add a designated safe zone
simply tell the watch where the kids are
allowed to go if the safe zone is
breached simply call the watch and find
out what's happened
kids love socializing and so does the
watch with its BFF feature simply shake
the washes together and they instantly
connect
just now the kids can share voice
messages and voice calling together the
waffle is big on safety so much so we
designed the take me hope function if
your child is lost they press the take
me home button and they're given simple
directions to get home
and on their way home if they want to
speak to you or see something they want
to share they can call you via their
watch and you don't have to worry about
the costs of the calls because the
waffle uses VoIP technology so when
calls are made there are no extra costs
to the package and if the kids need any
help they can press the SOS button using
this button tells the watch to call the
primary contact and if they don't answer
it tries another contact if no one
answers the watch will keep calling
until a contact does answer there are
many additional features such as an
alarm to tell the parents if the battery
is getting low a watch off alarm voice
messaging and emoticon sticker an
exercise tracker a group chat and their
journal history plus it's great at
helping kids learn to tell the time and
keep them organized we have created a
SmartWatch with kids in mind we've made
sure it's durable and consumes the
lowest amount of power design has played
a huge part in the waffles construction
designed by an if' design awarded
designer and our attention to detail
ensures that our user interface is super
easy to use and feels incredibly natural
the watch itself is comfy to wear
because of the high grade silicone
rubber which is durable and stretchable
the watch is even water resistant and
dust proof that said I'm honored to
introduce to you koji tofu
I'm Nicolas CEO at connected device
making technology fashionable has been a
challenge while in France I embrace this
challenge by developing poles and
accessories for luxury brands however I
wanted to make luxury technology Goods

push for the creation of digital sheets

feature which is designed for everyday
use
cachito fit integrates fitness
monitoring into your lifestyle with your
coach it'll fit you can track your steps

Kousaka feeds puts fashion and fun ahead

features to love the most
a watch should always accurate in deep
time but connected watch should give you
the option of connecting your life the

Wow yes we cool
nice shape design key yeah check it out

typing on a SmartWatch used to be
impossible now it is easy even a kid can
easily type on a watch and reply a
message I figured it out as we were
doing it it's pretty straightforward as
it's really nice real is mm oh yeah XL 5
seconds really easy the touch point
keeper is a revolutionary design which
makes typing on your SmartWatch easy and
intuitive this means you don't have to
pull your phone out of your pocket
to reply a message anymore comes in hand
instead of pulling at your phone and
talking you could just wrist I invented
and patented the touch one keeper based
on finger economic research the current
keeper was invented 150 years ago it
works Brown if there's a loss of space
for the 108 keys but nowadays with the
ever smaller devices we need a new
keeper which can be used easily on the
1.2 inch watch face and touch one is the
answer if this was in the market right
now a lot of people definitely get it if
I ever had a SmartWatch if it had
something like this he is definitely
yes touch one is an innovative but
simple design with a total of eight keys
plus some common gestures such as
tapping for space swiping left for
delete this unique design has enabled a
large text display on small screens plus
Araki finger-sized yeah I think my big
fingers touch one was the finalist at CP
Australia 2015 for innovation it was
also the winner of civic start-up pitch
and the smart company to counter a new
review of touch one set this SmartWatch
keyboard is faster than typing on an
iPhone we have spent four years of
development for the touchpad keyboard
and it is now ready to use on your
Android watch but due to the limitation
in the operation system of Android we
can only use touch one keyboard inside
an app and not at the OS level but there
is a solution
we are building an SMS app integrated
with the tattooin keyboard
we truly believe everyone should
download the new keyboard for their
smartwatches
so even a $5 pledge can help to boost to
finalize the development and get you to
have the beautiful SMS app with the
revolutionary touch one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
