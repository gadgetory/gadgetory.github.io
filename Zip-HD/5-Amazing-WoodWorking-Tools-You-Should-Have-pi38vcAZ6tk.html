are as good as new or even better than
new what a joint brakes the usual fixes
to add messy globs of glue and the same
screws or nails that failed the first
time well not anymore for over 25 years
furniture makers and pro woodworkers
have relied on Craig pocket hole jig to
build and repair furniture now you too
could easily fix a broken joint and make
it stronger and more permanent than it
was before thanks to the Craig joinery
system a Craig pocket hole jig lets you
extend the life of broken chairs frames
bookshelves drawers and more so don't
replace what you can easily repair do it
once do it right and move on and all you
need is your drill and a Kreg jig and
you can create watch solid joints that
are built to last the old way of doing
things required clamps and glue
alignment was difficult and clamping
force always seemed to squeeze out the
glue and make a mess but now just put
the Craig bit with its steps pilot tip
into any drill and your Kreg jig makes
building as simple as 1-2-3 first clamp
down the jig with any clamp then drill a
quick series of pocket holes at the
perfect angle and finally drive Craig's
self tapping screws to pull the two
parts together it's just that simple
with the Kreg jig you drive hidden
pocket holes that provide perfect
alignment every time you'll get ultra
strong joints with no exposed fasteners
and no messy glue you know the old
saying if it ain't broke don't fix it
well with the Kreg jig you'll be tempted
to fix things all around the house to
reinforce weak joints so they'll never
break a Kreg jig can pay for itself
fixing broken drawers wobbly tables and
chairs repair it quickly and relax and
be sure to use Craig's unique self
tapping screws made for every
application to give you those rock-solid
joints that are built to last
like to know how to avoid the typical
measuring marking and bad cuts you make
with your circular saw well put down
that tape measure and pay attention to
this because now you can make those
perfect repeatable cuts in plywood MDF
and other large sheet goods without
measuring or marking cut lines
thanks to that Craig rip cut saw a guy
with a Craig Ricker you can easily make
accurate straight cuts with your
circular saw every single time the Craig
rip cut lets you get the most from your
circular saw because it's so easy to set
up the whole process can take less than
a minute and you only have to do it once
and the Craig rip cut easily attaches to
most every brand of circular saw and has
a reversible guide for both right and
left handers that adjust quickly and
easily to your selected cutting width
once the RIP cut is set you can make
repeated cuts of the same width with no
measuring or marking you'll save time
and waste less material and the guide
could be quickly adjusted to another
width and you're back in business here's
a Craig tip support the sheet goods with
rigid foam insulation for cleaner
smoother safer cuts on work benches or
even the ground quality projects all
start with perfect cuts so the whip cut
guide should be on every workbench it's
the first tool to buy before building
bookshelves closet organizers tables or
anything else that requires the use of
sheath goods trade the difficulties of
cutting large pieces on the table saw
four laser straight perfect cuts made
easy with our whip cuts on guy Craig
jigs make it incredibly easy to build
with wood that's because Craig joinery
allows you to assemble projects with
screws instead of complicated joints
that require advanced skills and
expensive tools the Kreg jig makes this
possible but it's the Craig screw that
makes it all work by holding your pieces
together to create a strong long lasting
joint Craig screws are engineered with
unique features that ensure they'll
provide the best possible results in
Craig pocket hole joinery one of the
easiest ways to see those features is to
compare a Craig screw to a standard
screw side-by-side it's easy to see the
differences for starters the Craig screw
has a square drive head the square drive
it fits deeply into the head which makes
it easy to drive the screw with an
ordinary screw the driver can slip
easily and I can prevent you from
driving the screw all the way or worse
yet strip the screw head a Craig screw
looks different from an ordinary screw
at the other end too it's what we call a
self tamping tip the self tapping tip
means that you don't have to drill a
pilot hole just drive the screw and it
creates its own hole without splitting
the wood try that with an ordinary screw
and the results are usually much
different you also notice that a Craig
screw doesn't have threads along its
entire length like an ordinary screw
does as you drive the screw in the
threads bite into the mating piece and
the pocket hole the smooth section of
the screw can turn freely so the joint
pulls together tightly with an ordinary
screw the threads on the upper portion
of the screw can actually prevent the
joint from drawing tight the cutaway
helps illustrate one more important
feature on the Craig screw the flat
underside of the screw head that flat
area fits perfectly against the ledge at
the bottom of the pocket as the screw
cinches down this directs all of the
screws force straight in line with the
screw and draws the Craig joint tightly
together with an ordinary screw the
flare shape of the head directs force
outward as the screw cinches down this
can prevent a tight joint and even split
out the base of the pocket hole
there's one important feature of a Craig
screw that you can't see just by looking
at it it's case hardened Craig screws
are treated to have a hard outer shell
that gives them toughness sharp threads
and a head that doesn't strip out but
case hardening allows the inner part of
the screw to be a bit softer that's
actually good because a softer core
prevents the screws from being brittle
which can cause ordinary screws to snap
looking at all those features it's easy
to see why your Craig projects demand
Craig screws and now when you look at a
Craig screw you know how it works
remember when you had to smooth out
those joists when you needed to easily
fix a stubborn door or makes two uneven
boards flush tonight you can do all this
and more with the win electric hand
planer the six amp motor provides up to
thirty four thousand cuts per minute and
even the hardest in woods while most of
our competitors have a maximum depth of
5/64 of an inch the wind planer exhibits
sixteen pontius dots in one 128 inch
increments to fine tune your cuts
anywhere up to 1/8 of an HD to the win
electric hand planer also comes with a
handy dust collection bag that can be
attached to either the right or left
hand side of the planer an adjustment
wrench with onboard storage a kickstand
to protect your blade a rabbiting guide
to help measure the depth of your rabbit
and a parallel fit for making perfectly
straight cuts the base of the plate even
has a v-shaped groove to help make
shampooing the corners of your wood
easier than ever and if you have a dust
extractor you can plug it right in to
either side of your unit to maximize the
collection of sawdust and see your work
area cringe remember when you had a
reliable planer that gave you years of
quality service the concealed hinged jig
from Craig offers a fast reliable easy
to use solution that anyone can use to
install doors on cabinets or built-ins
or to refresh kitchen cabinets with new
updated doors that's because the
concealed hinge gig makes it easier than
ever to mount concealed hinges that give
doors a clean uncluttered look and the
jig lets you do it with the accuracy of
a drill press but using nothing more
than an ordinary drill the jig makes the
process easy thanks to indexing cams and
built-in measuring scales that ensure
exact hinge cut positioning plus a
removable guide for the included carbide
tipped bit using the concealed hinge gig
makes it simple to figure out the two
main things required for mounting these
hinges determining how far from the door
edge the hinge needs to be located and
how far the hinges sit from the top or
bottom of the door how far from the door
edge the hinge sits is called the offset
and the measurement varies depending on
the hinge type and brand usually you
just have to read the hinge instructions
measure and hope for the best
but the concealed hinges has index
Kam's that take out all of the guesswork
and uncertainty just turn the cam to the
appropriate setting and the jig will be
perfectly positioned when you place it
against the edge of the door that means
all you have to do is use the concealed
hinge digs measuring scale to position
the hinge at the desired distance from
the top or bottom of the door climb to
jig in place and the hinge cup hole will
be positioned correctly every time after
the cup hole is correctly located you
still need to drill a clean hole to the
proper depth doing that usually requires
a drill press and a specialized bit the
concealed hinge gig comes with a
high-quality carbide tip 35 millimeter
bit that's specifically designed for the
task the bit shears the wood cleanly
without tear out for perfect holes time
after time to ensure the hole is
straight that bit rides in a drilling
guide that lacks quickly and accurately
into the jig a stop collar ensures
correct hole depth every time - once the
cup is drilled the concealed hinged jig
makes it just as easy to drill the holes
for the hinge mounting screws just
remove the drilling guide and use the
two holes in the jig to guide an
ordinary 1/16 inch drill bit unclimbed
the concealed hinge gig and the hinge
drops into place and mounts accurately
every time whether you're installing
hinges on one door or adding new doors
to an entire kitchen that means all you
have to do is Mount the door to your
cabinet and the job is done confidently
quickly and with professional quality
results using just a drill with a
concealed hinge gig
