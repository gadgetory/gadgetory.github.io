rambunctious little kid a little bit
mischievous he's smart a lot of robot in
a very small package all the technology
inside of Cosmo is really there for one
reason to bring the magic of robotic
character to life it's a very complex
system and has for transmissions inside
of it with probably 40 or 50 years each
robot is made out of over 300 different
parts there's the AI systems the
robotics accelerometers the animation
gyros the computer vision we're running
an extremely complicated artificial
intelligence inside the robot which
needs to make thousands and thousands of
decisions per second
he's a mobile manipulator he can drive
around the world he can see you can
recognize you he looked up at me and his
eyes went whoa and I was like well he
just recognized me gives you goosebumps
because you realize that this is a
little character who actually
understands who you are and what role
you play in his world figuring out the
path to a unique personalities it's an
ongoing question I think we did about
40-50 Studies on just little nuances
looking at the interface with the
monitor where the eyes are going to look
at you Cosmo Wolf's the head
follows you every little detail had its
special attention paid to it we
literally have a rigged up version of
Cosmo in Maya where our animators can
animate him using the exact same
techniques that they would use for
digital characters except the output
isn't rendered the output is actually
caused by behaving in the real world
we've been looking for ways to make it
either feel more organic more imperfect
so that it feels smaller than he made it
sound is a critical piece it's the one
dimension where we have full control
just like in a movie or a video game
we're building his procedural voice
system we're doing all these things so
that as you interact with Cosmo he
becomes his own thing one of the things
that makes Cosmo so surprising and so
loveable as that he defies your
expectations we're creating something
that really does feel like it's part of
the family those are the moments usually
don't share with machines or robots
until now introducing ANFO a $59 robot
anyone can adopt an PO is an affordable
educational and easy to assemble robot
it takes less than an hour to assemble
and we'll teach you about robotics the
ant Bo has six legs and walks just like
an ant plus it is also a robot and plus
robot equals and both designed for
anyone with an inquisitive mind an PO is
a great starting point for young
inventors and for people interested in
steam education even if you are not a
maker it is still a cool robot companion
then you will have fun with once
assembled you can control ant bo-lieve
remote by your own voice or even by
drawing lines with more than one ant Bo
you can even make them fight each other
and Bo enhances problem-solving
abilities when you are familiar with how
it works
tweak its code and make it do different
things you can also upgrade your robot
with dozens of different sensor modules
and program it via arduino scratch or
when do an po is connected it collects
user data and uploads it to the cloud
users will be able to check metrics like
distance skill levels and
accomplishments and share with friends
an PO is intelligent it has 30 neurons
that enable it to learn to adapt just
like a real creature as time goes it
becomes smarter faster and more capable
empo also has emotional reactions to
different scenarios for example glancing
left and right when it feels inquisitive
trembling when it feels threatened and
showing affection and loyalty i want you
to have this because when I was young it
taught me a valuable lesson about saving
for what I wanted I know it may look
like just a piggy bank but it's much
more than that it's linked to your own
very first savings and there's no limit
what you can put into it you set up your
goals and what you want to save for and
then tasks can be assigned to do around
the house if it can you take out the
trash
this is earning enough to get all right
now
that are worth money towards your going
take out the trash please
like take out the trash it'll teach you
about responsibility your kind of reward
while making savings fun ready hey
and instill a sense of accountability as
well you learn that setbacks won't get
in the way of getting to those goals if
you work hard show a good sense of
determination do everything else render
no I can think of and approach things
with an optimistic attitude those goals
are attainable the lesson that's the
most important the one thing to never
forget tax that's why I want you to have
this you might be a little too young but
you'll get there
imagination is a beautiful thing it's
the source of our big ideas and it makes
us want to bring them to life
introducing cell robot a modular robot
built to inspire the month it uses the
cells as components that allow you to
build and expand your robot to many
forms the cells are powered by a heart a
lithium-ion battery that provides power
to the cell as soon as it's connected
giving life to your robot
choose from the many dozens of
pre-designed robots from the shape
library follow the helpful tutorials to
walk you through construction easily
combine cells together through a twist
and lock motion then control your cell
robot from the app additional
accessories allow you to expand your
ideas further by adding wheels amount
and even a camera and you don't just
need to stick to the instructions in
custom mode you can build anything you
can imagine program movements for each
individual cell using custom mode in the
app then watch it go what you make is up
to you cell robot is an extension of
your imagination a platform for
combining building with creativity share
your imagined inventions and inspire
your friends what will you build cell
robot
traditional construction bricks are a
work of genius when it comes to building
rigid structures but when you add flex
oh and the little creativity a new door
opens to a world of flexibility
flexo when added to regular construction
bricks changes the dynamic of building
and adds new functionality flexibility
strength and support we have seen but a
fraction of what the system can do in
the hands of Master Builders my name's
James and I'm the son of Mike the
creator of Flik sir when I saw the
product I just thought you know this is
something pretty special pretty amazing
and really wanted to get on board with
it and be a part of what flicks ours and
what it can offer wind flicks I was
designed we wanted to give people the
opportunity to really unleash their
creativity and that in turn would just
absolutely maximize the enjoyment they
get out of their sets of construction
Brooks what led me to develop flex
though was that I was enough physio and
I had a torn tendon and I was just
amazed absolutely amazed at the beauty
of the body and how bones and tendons
work together it was a you know bone is
a very fixed construction and then a
tendon allows our fixed construction to
move with elegance so how does flexor
work it's really simple the ends of the
flexor tendon fits snugly into the
openings of the flexor brick and when
you want to get really extreme you can
further secure the flexor tendon by
placing another brick flexo or otherwise
on top then you can twist Bend stretch
and flex to your heart's content
the only limitation to what you create
is the vast expanse of your imagination
and your flexo collection so flicks
those an add-on to regular construction
bricks it was designed to add to the
experience and the opportunity that
regular construction bricks allow in
terms of creativity as well as design
and ideas it allows you to for a very
small investment basically and twice if
not three times the functionality to the
existing brick collection already have
new ideas and uses are coming up every
day with flexo and how it interacts with
construction bricks
it can provide rigidity flexibility
stored energy playability and even bling
ability just like you we love
construction bricks and we love our
collections and what we can build with
them we want to add to that with the
release of flexo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
