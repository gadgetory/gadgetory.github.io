job greatness isn't easy just ask for
people who build our modern world like
them Ark is ready to do what's never
been done bill for the hardest-working

check that out
oh not good nice outfit have you taken a
look at the average homeowner lately
we're wearing a lot of hats these days
handyman landscaper carpenter sportsman
with Jack's of all trades we like our
toy and we like our tools when they
happen to come in the same package well
it's not hard to get our attention
introducing the Raven NPV 7100 M
remember that first multi-tool
pocketknife your grandfather gave you
well made its big brother and then some
at its core the MT V 70 100 s is the
ultimate three-in-one machine riding
lawn mower rugged backroads vehicle and
affordable generator as a hybrid riding
lawn mower
The Raven MTV's 46 inch mowing deck can
be adjusted to ten cutting heights and
can handle some pretty sizable real
estate and it's incredibly tight turning
radius will have you maneuvering around
some pretty tricky areas most riding
mowers rely on belts and transmissions
to drive the cutting blades this waste
energy uses more fuel the mt v-- 70 100
s is an electric direct drive system the
gasoline motor generates electricity and
transfers more power to the wheels than
traditional riding mowers allowing the
user to get the job done quickly and
efficiently and because it's a hybrid it
runs cleaner now here's where it gets
interesting the mower deck can be easily
removed by removing the power connector
and a few pins which turns the Raven MPV
into a bat road vehicle
now we're ready to roll and we mean roll
up to 17 miles per hour in either gas or
electric mode plus it has a TV style
front shocks and suspension so you can
maneuver opera better yet and drive it
like a car with foot pedals and a
steering wheel and let's not forget
about that hybrid function let's say
you're a hunter or maybe a wildlife
photographer now getting in the woods
doesn't have to sound like a stampede is
coming you can roll in silently under
electric power when you're ready to come
home
motor out in hybrid mode and it
recharges your battery save the best for
last the NPV 70 100's is also a powerful
electric generator they can supply power
over five outlets for up to 10 hours
that's a really nice benefit for those
projects that are beyond your extension
cords reach now you can add power
whenever you need it wherever you need
it whether that's a jobsite on the edge
of your property or simply a campsite
where you want the luxury of having
electricity at your disposal
7,000 watts of power is nothing to
sneeze at it can keep you on line even
after a storm takes you off line every
once in a while a product comes along
and turns your head a product that gets
it right well today's that day this is
that product the Raven MTV 7100 M trust

introducing the cool box the world's
most advanced tool box hi I'm Mike and
I'm Chris the history of the modern tool
box is over a hundred years old but
today there have been very few truly
remarkable enhancements or improvements
made to this commonly used carrying case
that's what motivated us to develop the
cool box we've assembled the team of
some of the best product designers
engineers and business development
people in the industry the cool box
product combines many commonly used
tools and workshop items with some of
the most recent and popular
technological enhancements all for the
purpose of making projects easier and
more enjoyable we've created our first
two prototypes and are extremely
satisfied with how they turned out our
warehouse fulfillment center and
manufacturing facility are all set up
