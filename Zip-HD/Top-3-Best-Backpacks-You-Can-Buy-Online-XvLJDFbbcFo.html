solar-powered backpack that keeps your
phone charged and your stuff safe let's
check it out the 21st century has
redefined the way that we live our lives
you're no longer tied to an office 37
percent of US workers say they work from
home in the past month that's up over
400 percent since 1995 I'm pretty sure
that your phone's been upgraded since
then and it's time that your bag was -
with life pack we've reinvented the
mobile office does your phone battery
ever die are you ever worried about your
bag getting stolen or broken into do you
have a hard time keeping organized well
lucky for you life packs here to save
the day let's start with why you're
never gonna have to deal with a dead
phone again the solar bank is a
removable unit which has a solar panel
and a battery with enough power to
charge an iPhone 6 up to 12 times you
can charge the solar bank via USB then
when you're out and about the solar
panel keeps the power topped up the
solar bank also has built-in Bluetooth
speakers so you have great sounding
audio with you when you're on the go
life pack has an integrated lock this
means you can lock the zipper shut when
you're on the go and what's really cool
about this lock is that you can actually
lock the bag to something when you're
sitting still because of the unique
design of the zippers you can also lock
the zipper shut while locking it to a
fixed point the bottom of the cable can
not be removed and the exit point is
reinforced so it's super strong also the
end of the lock works is a bottle opens
cheers salud
so on things go the work zone is
incredibly organized there's a separate
section for your laptop iPad there's a
space for your wallet there's a key hook
business cards pens there's also a
section for loose papers and a separate
pocket so you don't lose receipts in the
life zone is a protected pocket for your
sunglasses as room for clothes and enter
view your non-work stuff because you
don't want your undies falling out into
work meeting because we all know that
time is that just me that's happened -
there are four hidden compartments on
this bag on your shoulder straps are two
pockets these are big enough for credit
cards travel cards for the subway or
Metro cash loose change or even your
headphones pressed up to your back or
two more hidden pockets these are ideal
for your passport and boarding card
these pockets are even big enough for an
iPhone six-plus and on one side there's
a USB plug that connects to the solar
mass so you can charge your phone up
while you're on the go
we're proud to introduce the ample smart
backpack the world's most advanced
portable charging solution integrated
directly into the fabric of a bag I
think that it should be easier to charge
your phone in your laptop wherever you
are without needing to find a power
outlet my life is lived on the go I
can't keep my laptop charged past noon
my phone needs to be plugged in before
3:00 p.m. I must have tried every
portable charging system portable
battery most of them just don't get it
done what I really need is a serious
charging solution that can power
anything anytime anywhere
but the portable charging solution that
I needed didn't exist and I wanted to
build it and when I explained what I
wanted to do to some engineering friends
of mine they wanted to help because they
needed it - we're proud to introduce the
ample smart backpack the portable
charging solution that we needed and we
think you might need - and we're proud
to have been named a 2015 CES Innovation
Awards honoree in two categories a
testament to the engineering rigor that
was put into the development of this
product so I've been designing bags for
over a decade and the challenge here was
that the bag wasn't just holding your
devices but you are also plugging your
devices into the bag for them to be
charged I started to create illustration
drawings where I would then send them to
Tomoko and she would start engineering
the housings around those pieces and
then she would send them back and I
would tailor the bag design around her
CAD data our goal was to create a design
that was truly intuitive for the user
and we wanted the electronics to almost
disappear into the fabrics of the bag
the ample smart backpack can charge all
of your devices is overnight or
throughout the day we integrated a
powerful custom-built battery that can
recharge a smartphone two to three times
there's a USB port in every pocket and
you can add three expansion batteries
for days that you need more power the
modular batteries charge rapidly when
docked into the bag but can also be
removed and used separately you can
stick in your coat pocket or your purse
and take to dinner with you and you
don't have to carry the bag with you to
have that
got power when we first thought about
putting electronics into a backpack we
immediately worried what happens if you
drop it so we added shock absorbers and
an extra layer of foam all the way
around and we applied a water-resistant
coating to all of the exterior fabrics
to help keep the rain out if you ever
forgotten your backpack at a coffee shop
the ample smart backpack can alert you
if you do and we built a mobile app that
will monitor battery levels connected
devices and smart sensors in the bag or
you can use the OLED display and touch
sensor to monitor the vitals inside of
the bag without ever opening a zipper
