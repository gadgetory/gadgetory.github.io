- [Narrator] In video games,
(dramatic music)
even virtual reality,
you are merely a player
in a world that is not your own.
SuperSuit lets you become you in a world
limited only by your own imagination.
Forged from technology light years away,
powered by the energy inside you.
Get ready to don the SuperSuit.
(electronic blasts)
SuperSuit is the world's first
wearable gaming platform.
(electronic blasts)
And uses new Zi-Fi technology
to communicate suit to suit,
so they work anywhere.
The Super Vest is it's power core.
It lights up, makes sound,
and has haptic feedback,
letting you feel when you get hit.
The Super Glove is the tool
to activate special abilities.
Its' ENGaGE gesture technology
gives you the power to unleash shockwaves,
generate forcefields,
(electronic blasts)
and much more.
Inside every suit is a special
super bot, which act as allies
boosting your defense.
Zap your oppponents.
(electronic blast)
Or be the goal of the game.
(electronic blasts)
Stocked full of a variety
of games and mods,
gives SuperSuit the
ability to be experienced
single or multiplayer.
Like in SuperSuit's take on
Capture the Flag, the suits bots
become goals sought after
by opposing team members.
And in its' flagship
strategy game Robinhook,
players use the SuperSuit's
give and take features to steal resources
from the rich team
and give them to the poor team.
With SuperSuit, the more you play
the more powerful you become.
Instead of leveling up a character,
you level up, rewarding you with
powers and gestures as
your abilities increase.
And tracking those powers
is done in the app,
where you can monitor current level,
compare scores and active minutes,
and download new games.
(electronic blasts)
Inside SuperSuit exists
a new world of gaming.
Get ready to unlock your potential.
(electronic buzzing)
Get ready to don the SuperSuit
(buzzing, blast)
and live the game.
(upbeat country music)
[Announcer] Now folks,
Lightning McQueen is back.
(Revving engine)
(screeching tires)
- Another day, another drive.
(screeching tires)
Man that was a great run.
(screeching tires and engines revving)
And the crowd goes wild.
- Hey Dad, can I borrow your car?
- Let's show them how it's done.
- Okay.
- Time to watch a pro.
(tires screeching)
(upbeat country music)
- [Narrator] Your kids.
On one hand, you know they have
tremendous potential.
And you're confident they'll have an
incredible job in a developing market.
On the other hand, they can enjoy
eating an entire tube of toothpaste.
When getting them a new toy,
you want it to be fun,
because they're just kids,
but you also want to develop
their more intellectual side
because they can't really
eat paste for a living.
Meet AlgoBrix.
Smart coding blocks that teach your kids
actual coding.
It's a simple concept.
Choose and build a robot,
code it to do nearly anything,
then press play and watch it go.
Here's what's special about AlgoBrix.
While there are many STEM products
that teach your kid how
to think analytically,
AlgoBrix does more than that.
It teaches your kids how to actually code.
To code a robot, your kid uses
two types of bricks:
functions and parameters.
Just like a code, they're function blocks
for sound, movement, and light.
Stacking parameters on top of functions
creates the different actions.
Big parameters for small children,
and small ones for more complex commands.
Here's a line of code that will
make the algocanon play music,
move straight, then spin right
while blinking its eyes
in blue and red lights
then shoot balls for six seconds.
Here's how that line
would look in real code.
AlgoBrix even helps your
kids debug their code,
by lighting up what's currently running.
Want to make it even more interesting?
Add sensors to the bot to respond
to sound, touch, distance, and light.
And it all conncets to an Arduino Brain.
With all these options,
the possibilities are endless.
Here's an AlgoBot that takes a bite
every time you clap your hands.
And this ferris wheel
starts spinning when you open its door.
You don't have to invent
your own activities,
AlgoBrix comes with
various activity boards and
activity cards that will lead your kids
step by step on the path
to becoming a coder.
Once your kid masters AlgoBrix,
the transition to real code is a cinch.
All you need to do is sit back,
watch your kids expand their minds,
and then clean up the carpet.
Because after all, they're still kids.
Now that sounds great,
but you've heard about
stuff like this before.
And you know what happens.
You buy a new toy, your kids get excited,
then five minutes later,
they're back on their tablet.
Not with AlgoBrix.
AlgoBrix is compatible with Lego bricks.
Remember when you were a kid
and couldn't stop playing with them?
Now imagine if you could
make anything you created
make sounds, light up, and come to life.
AlgoBrix was created by two people,
Amir and Danny,
both obsessed with educational games.
Danny has a PhD in Robotics
and Amir is an education tech entrepeneur
and founder of Young Engineers,
an educational network that teaches STEM
in over 40 countries worldwide.
Together they want to
take coding education
to a whole new level.
So if you want to bring out
your kid's full potential,
and teach them how to actually code,
get AlgoBrix.
Your kids will have an incredible time.
And a bright future.

- [Narrator] Imagination
is a beautiful thing.
It's the source of our big ideas
and it makes us want
to bring them to life.
Introducing Cell Robot, a modular robot
built to inspire the mind.
(spinning squeak)
It uses cells as components
that allow you to build
and expand your robot
to many forms.
The cells are powered by a heart.
A lithium ion battery that provides power
to the cell as soon as it's connected
giving life to your robot.
Choose from the many dozens
of predesigned robots
from the shape library,
follow the helpful tutorials
to walk you through construction,
easily combine cells together
through a twist and lock motion,
then control your Cell Robot from the app.
Addional accessories allow you
to expand your ideas further,
by adding wheels,
a mount,
and even a camera.
And you don't just need to
stick to the instructions.
In custom mode,
you can build anything you can imagine.
Program movements for each
individual cell using
custom mode in the app.
Then, watch it go.
What you make is up to you.
Cell Robot is an
extension of your imagination,
a platform for combining
building with creativity.
Share your imagined inventions
and inspire your friends.
What will you make?
(dramatic music)
- [Narrator] In 2015, we successfully
crowdfunded a paper
shooters construction kit
toy blaster.
Since then, we have sold
thousands of blasters,
shipped millions of spitballs,
and are stocked in major retailers
all around the world.
Now, we're back, with a new range
that you don't need to build,
Spitball Blasterz.
These are all plastic,
fully assembled, and shoot
straight out of the box.
Spitball Blasterz raises the bar
for projectile-based toy combat
by utilizing 100% biodegradable
and readily available
tissue paper as ammo.
Now, you'll never need to buy more ammo
or collect it outblasted.
Let's take a look at how it works.
Simply take a piece of tissue paper,
roll it into a tube.
Next, snip off one centimeter pieces,
then dip each piece in water
and place inside the mold cavity.
Press the mold, and there you go,
perfect spitballs, every time.
(dramatic music)
Load the ammo into the shell,
then into the magazine,
the ammo sticks to the targets,
and for you wimps out there,
they don't hurt if you get hit.
The Assault Rifle S
Spitball Blasterz SP9000
allows you to blast 100%
biodegradable spitballs
that you can make yourself
with ordinary tissue
with the ability to hit targets
up to 65 feet away.
The blasters feature awesome paint jobs
and thanks to the unique cocking system,
also offer real triggers
and ejecting shells.
In addition, they feature a flip-clip,
which allows for 16
shots without reloading,
meaning you will own your battlefield.
We also include a brass catcher,
so you don't have to worry about
collecting your the shells.
We've been working on this project
for almost two years, going from idea
to sketches to working prototypes.
The tooling is finalized,
and our manufacturing partners
are in place to commence production
as soon as we hit our goal.
If you want to turn ordinary tissues
into endless biodegradable ammo,
then blast it up to 65 feet,
then back this campaign.
In return, well send you
our awesome blasters.
Thank you.
