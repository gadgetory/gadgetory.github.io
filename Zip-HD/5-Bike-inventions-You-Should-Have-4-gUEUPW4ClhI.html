this is the urban X smart electric wheel
and it is the only difference between
your existing bike and a fully
functional electric bike by simply
replacing the front wheel of the bike
you already own it will turn into an
electric bike and take your cycling to
the next level
it flattens out the hill and beats down
any headwind it shortens the distance by
making it faster and getting to your
destination without breaking a sweat
urban X electric wheel fits any size and
type of bike either v brake or disc
brakes so you can enjoy the benefits of
an electric bike while keeping the bike
you already have it comes in either
model version or pedal-assist version
the choice is yours all the components
including motor battery and other
electronics are well contained within
the wheel just a few steps of quick
installation and a new electric bike is
ready to ride we've engineered an app
that lets you choose whether or not to
use of features like distance and speed
tracking battery light breeze out and
ride mapping but those aren't for you
that enjoy the wheel free from any
device
the innovative detachable battery makes
it possible to extend your range
instantly while the built-in USB outlets
can keep your phone or other devices
always charged when a start biking to
work
urban X helps you arrive fresh without
breaking a sweat
wanna ride the facing health conditions
or aging issues urban s eliminates all
these obstacles to help you run your
daily errands when it's been more time
outdoors you can now ride without
worrying about up slopes or long
distances with speed of up to 20 miles
per hour and the ability to travel up to
30 miles with one single battery your
venture can take you further
Urban X is all about by recreation
freedom and accessibility this is up
well this was up when life revolved
around blank then we turn into this the
point is we've known each other since
kindergarten and life still revolves
around to yield so much in fact we've
set up a company together to make
awesome bikes at a great price that was
in 2010 insanity grown if you've gone
from taking a gamble on a truckload of
bikes we thought people might want to
producing a ton of us we know people
want we've got all the grown-up stuff
like a 15 office and a warehouse full of
bikes ready for delivery so now with a
mission to get more people on bikes you
design one that can revolutionize your
world and urban transportation ladies
and gentlemen would like to introduce
some pure cycles both
and we know there are plenty of ice on
the market there's heavy one pricey one
kind of funny-looking wrong we even had
a crack at making one for y'all before
we were quite satisfied so we scoured
the globe and assembled a team of
engineering gurus some and his friends
we figured out how our bike would have a
40 mile range on a single charge how the
battery would fit stealthily into the
top cube the motor into the rear hub and
how our bikes would be one of the
lightest ebikes
on the market we also did this all right
off your walk towards me bro so once
again introduce to you the pure cycles
Volta this bike is simple and you know
it looks smart we need it in smart and
even has its own app featuring GPS
tracking it's a by Kickstarter a workout
log and smart modes to maximize battery
life and giving your desired level of
output power regenerates with braking an
integrated smart light switch on and off
automatically this bike is pedal istic
stripping away the unnecessary buttons
we promise and while you are in the
kudos are looking like you're working
out on the way to the office the breezy
power assisted riding when you want even
some sludged your mate them being urban
dwellers ourselves we recognize their
fate is at a premium so we wanted to
design an e-bike and not only pack the
punch on the road but can be fit into a
tight space or carry it up to a fifth
floor apartment
surely if I get smart and fast fun
exists it is overly expensive out here
you say well not really our bikes will
retail for around $2,500 for our backers
we're cutting the price by $1,000 making
the pure cycles Voltas one of the most
affordable ski bikes on the market so
what good is a special backer feel if it
takes years to get your but it's no good
at all that's why we're making you a
promise you back this campaign you will
get your bike by the end of 2017
guarantee how do we know we can pull
this off because we've got the best guys
on the job and because they're a lot
better at making quality bikes and we
are at Ariel
Winston company presents a revolutionary
bicycle shock absorber the R instant
spring is designed to make cycling more
comfortable and help riders stay healthy
this innovative device is easy to
install under the seat of any bicycle
adjust the rigidness for your weight and
the type of road in just one minute
make your bike ride smooth and enjoyable
people ride bicycles on different roads
asphalt gravel paint stone dirt and Hill
writing a bicycle is great and we all
love it vibrations can be felt even on
the smoothest tarmac which can have a
negative effect on your health when you
ride over stones or potholes you can
feel significant shock the r instance
spring will make you a ride much more
comfortable and safe you'll use less
energy and stay healthier by reducing
the negative effect of road vibrations
on your body the R instant spring was
tested by more than 100 bike riders of
different age groups and body types they
traveled more than 7,000 miles on
different bikes and surfaces in both hot
and cold weather conditions and we got
only positive feedback
we have developed and tested more than
10 prototypes using different types of
steel we have come a long way the rinsed
in spring is made of high-quality robust
material so we can offer you a lifetime
warranty
know the feeling so do we in fact 50% of
active cyclists will have their bike
stole this is even worse for bike wheels
because any thief with a wrench can
remove your wheels in less than 30
seconds right now you need to carry
multiple locks to fully secure your
entire bike one for the front wheel and
another for the back wheel and frame but
this sucks because wants to carry
multiple locks and then lock them every
single time to ride don't forget that
means multiple T's locks and all your
books binders backpack and laptop the
new solution to this madness is not lock
nut lock provides one-time installation
bike wheel security this innovative
product works by replacing the bicycle
wheels existing fasteners with custom
engineered ones that can only be removed
with the unique key in your package you
install it once and that wheel is now
protected yeah just one time
nut locks helps you outsmart by fully
protecting against commonly a decimal
tool
it also removes the need to carry an
additional you lock or cable lock to
secure your entire bike keep in mind nut
lock only protects your wheels so you do
still need a you lock or cable lock to
secure your bike to an external object
we've custom engineered over 37 designs
and prototypes to deter theft as much as
possible new variations are being
created by the day making it practically
impossible for a thief to get his hands
on all the different nut lock
combinations and if you ever want to
remove your wheels all you need is the
key that came with your package just
throw that key on your keychain and
you're good to go
security has always felt good but it's
never looked so grab nut lock lock your
nuts and celebrate by popping yourself a
cold one Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
