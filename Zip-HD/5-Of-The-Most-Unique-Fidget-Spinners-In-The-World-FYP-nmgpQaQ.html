now your journey is ready to be shown
around
I never really thought it was a problem
I'd always suspected those around me had
seen my incessant pen clicking me
shaking and desk tapping but I had no
idea how bad it had gotten
I just figured it all the time with
anything I could get my hands on didn't
matter what the bubble wrap a bubble
wrap the way a pop pop pops
he just couldn't get enough that was
probably wrong
thankfully my Kickstarter community
from the people who brought you to ad
comes over the counter fidget cube
feature cube is a vital desk toy
designed to satisfy any urges to click
roll spin and other common fidgety
impulses without driving your colleagues
and loved ones away
the GQ is a cube that you fidget with
studies have suggested that fidgeting
increases focus and improves
productivity side effects may include a
sudden ability to complete boring
meetings pay attention in class power
through Netflix marathons budget caleb
is designed to allow discrete visioning
in any setup do not know such a cube if
you have an aversion to rectangular
prisms physique you'd let's be
satisfying my fidgety without endlessly
annoying those around me I thought I
could stop at any time and now I realize
I don't want to fidget cube can help
take the first step to fidget in freedom
today okay so in all seriousness we make
joke about fidgeting when we give our
friends and coworkers a hard time for
the pen clicking and the nail biting but
what if there aren't simple what if the
GA is a coping mechanism a way for us to
sleep focus the more present in the
moment some science is smarter than us
believe that we have this thing called
floating attention which makes it hard
for us to focus in certain circumstances
hey Mark yeah yeah and actually the
genie has been shown to be able to help
keep that flow the attention occupied
which helps you better hope us in the
task at hand
what's maybe even a little crazier is
that some recent studies have suggested
that students who use fidgeting as a
mechanism during testing
tend to perform better on those tests
than when they're Arts itself
fidget cube has been a project we've
dreamt about for almost four years now
and we're excited to finally be bringing
it to you it's been a long road with a
lot of prototypes where we think we're
going to love it when designing fidgets
cube wanted to ensure two things first
the functionality needed to truly
satisfy fidgeting needs it needed to be
an entire toolbox of fidgety options
while staying small and compact which
leads us to our second and equally
important priority we wanted phidget
cube to be a premium best toy that could
be discreetly used in any situation from
a classroom to a boardroom
the fidget cube of course has six sides
