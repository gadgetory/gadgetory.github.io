handheld air compressor that pulls in
the outside air and then compresses it
into the tire it's fast easy to use and
extremely convenient you no longer need

bulky air compressor you no longer need

reads the pressure and can be set to
stop automatically when it gets to the
correct tire pressure the air Hawk can

traditional hand pumps are difficult to
use in clumsy the air Hawk is easier
faster and far more efficient the air
Hawk comes with several air nozzles for
a wide variety of uses you know how
frustrating it is when you have a flat
ball but with the air Hawk flat balls
are no longer a problem in the past

durable tool that you'll use all the
time
all cool garages start from the ground
up and that begins with race tech garage
flooring nearly twenty years ago I
created race tech a durable
cost-effective truly do-it-yourself
garage flooring system transform that
ugly garage floor in just hours not days
race TX multi patent design allows for
easy installation without all the
hassles and mess of toxic epoxy coatings
durable and easy to clean standing up to
the harshest of garage environments our
patented power lock system not only
makes installation is snapped but it
keeps your floor locked in race deck is
engineered tough handling vehicle
rolling loads in excess of 80,000 pounds
proudly made in USA in our ISO quality
certified facility guaranteeing you the
best garage flooring system you can buy
anytime you get a nail or a staple that
needs to come out it's always a paint
hammer uses a conventional cloth blood
and nail much like the cat's paw it's on
the back of the quick Ripper basically
coming around the head and then pulling
the nail out that way the quick Ripper
it's got that cat's paw but it's also
got these jaws it'll pull just about
anything you can get in those be it
screws staples nails whatever you
actually get a lot more leverage with a
quick Ripper more force up top more of
it is translated into polling force
because of the way it's designed so as
you're pulling it out it's gripping
harder and harder and harder the harder
you pull the harder it grips and it
makes just about anything come out
staples are pain to get out with a
conventional hammer because it can only
grab one side at a time the quick grip
is wide jaws can grab both sides of the
staple at once pulling the whole thing
out in one fluid motion no matter where
it's at nothing else pulls a nail in the
corner out but quick rip or does the
jaws won't pull out what conventional
forks won't ever come close to because
it can actually get right into a corner
and pull those nail screws and staples
out things like long nails right now
conventional hammer can't get a nail
past a certain point the quick Ripper
allows you to take a second bite at that
nail and pull it all the way through
pretty much no matter how long the nail
is you can get it out with a quick
gripper it doesn't matter if the nail is
mangled if it's headless in fact it's
got enough gripping force that it can
actually grab the pointed end of a nail
pull it right through a board doesn't
matter if the head is there or not the
quick Ripper helps save you money in
several different ways it replaces a lot
of tools that you wouldn't normally have
to carry around things like locking
pliers a large crowbar a hammer it
replaces several tools at once so you
don't have to hunt for another tool when
the one you have won't do the job does a
quick River does them all it can
actually help you repurpose wood you can
take old boards off of a deck pull all
the nails out no matter how embedded
that head is you just grab the whole
thing pull it through in one fluid
motion reuse all those boards and works
great for trim because trim always uses
those little tiny Brad's
that are pain to get out because you
can't pound them through or they Bend we
can just grab them from the back side
pull them right through and you can
reuse that trim it saves everybody time
and money
no matter what their project the quick
Ripper was designed to be used by
everybody from professionals down to
your home hobbyist who's just got a
small project that they need to do the
quick Ripper is great for everyone from
the professional construction worker
down to your home hobbyist who just has
a project here and there makes a great
gift and they'll make every job that
much easier introducing the Stanley fat
max power claw a first-of-its-kind
clamping power strip that allows you to
clamp your power where you need it when
you need it the power Club grabs on to
just about anything and with three
grounded outlets it lets you tap into
power safely and securely the power claw
is designed to supply power in
unconventional places and keeps you from
having to deal with loose wires and we
all know how dangerous that can be
it comes with a three foot heavy-duty
cord and features a built-in circuit
breaker to prevent overloads don't deal
with loose flimsy wires ever again
because now you can have the power cloth
using a tape measure just got easier
with the introduction of the e tape 16
it solves a problem virtually everyone
has measuring mistakes and it's actually
educational and fun to use the e tape 16
takes the human error out of measuring
by giving you an accurate digital
measurement every time with the ability
to recall your measurements at any time
as you lengthen the tape measure blade
you immediately see ye tape sixteen is
different and not your ordinary tape
measure it takes the guesswork out of
measuring with a large digital display
one can see and read the measurement
clearly with the touch of the inch
centimeter button it allows you to read
the measurement displayed in inches feet
fractions decimals and even converts
from standard to metric and back not
only does it measure easily and
accurately but it has several other
useful functions when taking a
measurement you can use the standard
blade lock or use the digital hold
button the large display makes your
measurement easy to use and easy to
remember and recall with a touch of a
button the inside-outside function
allows you to measure to the front of
the tape measure or to the back and
calculates the extra width
no more needing to bend your blade when
backed into a corner when you need to
hang a picture or find the center of a
measurement press this centerline button
and it will calculate it for you
whenever someone sees the e tape digital
tape measure for the
time their initial reactions are that is
cool it makes total sense and I want one
thus the digital tape measure was born
since its origin the e tape is proven
useful in a multitude of settings the e
tape sixteen is a unique and durable
tool that provides data in a more simple
reliable and accurate way for any job
