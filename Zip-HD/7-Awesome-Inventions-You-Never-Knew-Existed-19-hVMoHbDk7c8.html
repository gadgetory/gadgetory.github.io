quick custom-fit bluetooth earphones
guided by our app you simply put the
earphones in and let the gel-filled tips
take the natural shape of your ears by
pressing the start button you trigger
the magic the molding process activates
transforming the gel tips to their
permanently hardened customized shape
we've designed wait it's not easy yes
it's that easy we've designed rebels to
fit you and your lifestyle our sports
skins add an extra layer of protection
and personality but to truly deliver
great earphones the sound must be as
perfect as the fit and so we partnered
with onkyo pioneers in high-end audio
technology we're working with their team
of acoustic engineers to deliver
world-class audio and crap the ultimate
listening experience
the custom fit provides enhanced passive
noise isolation allowing listeners to
escape from their surroundings and enjoy
every detail of their music and safer
volumes but four times when you don't
want complete isolation we've created
the rebels adjustable soundscape it's
your very own volume control for the
outside world rebels have eight hours of
reliable play time and with the revive
battery pack you'll get an additional
six hours of comfortable use and if ever
you want to charge while listening

cable sit back relax and enjoy
this is Nora a smart snoring solution
that you want to have in your bedroom
this is you well rested and fresh but
you used to be more like this thanks to
your outstanding vocal performance you
got a lot of this yep your snoring is
putting a damper on things at home and
you know it can increase the chance of
strokes and heart attacks so you go out
there and try all kinds of anti snore
products and then you meet Nora using
Nora is simple just pick your favorite
pillow put the expander in your
pillowcase tap Nora and go to sleep when
you start snoring Nora gently moves your
head so you stop before your partner
wakes up the science of it is simple
when you fall asleep your neck and
throat muscles relax this decreases the
size of the airway and causes the
vibrations the slight movement of your
head stimulates these muscles and opens
the airway so you can breathe normally
again
the best part is you won't feel a thing
you can sleep in any position or on any
part of the pillow our patent-pending
design is just as effective everything
about Nora is designed to make it a
delightful addition to your bedroom the
organic shape is inspired by natural
objects and the smooth matte finish
looks great in any setting Nora comes in
a beautiful portable bag equipped with a
rechargeable battery making it easy to
use on the go we created Nora because we
were frustrated with the impractical and
expensive products out there a year of
obsessive designing prototyping and
testing has brought us here the result
is unlike any other snoring solution an
elegant device with a seamless
experience now ready for mass production

calls send and receive messages browse
through news feeds track fitness stats
and much more all directly on my wrist
all on its own here's a pocket screen
much like a mouse a keyboard or a
monitor this pocket screen is simply an
interface for my hub it's not very smart
it doesn't need to be if I need a bigger
screen I can grab a tab screen or i can
plug it into this keyboard if i want to
be more productive i can even use this
dongle to turn any existing TV and to
another screen for my wrist now that I'm
always using the same computing hub I
can start an application on one screen
and seamlessly continue it on another if
I lose a screen no worries it has none
of my personal stuff and because these
screens are inexpensive and can be
everywhere all I ever you do carry is my
hump
