encrypted your phone your iPad your
Wi-Fi your suitcase the door of your
building and of course your credit card
has a digit code for sure it's better to
be safe by the way how safe is your
wallet in your own home for example have
you ever realized you were missing some
cash or is it safe in your own bedroom
your credit card number never ended up
on the internet without your consent at
the office are you really sure nobody
can sneak in your wallet and violate
your privacy then we realized there was
one item that we don't secure enough our
wallets this is why we created and are
proud to present the many safe wallet
the first code encrypted pocket-sized
vault including a locking system with a
thousand different combination
possibilities and a choose your own
system it's amazing how much progress
has been made in terms of tracking
systems lately that's why we propose the
option to embed your wallet with a
tracking system to ensure you never lose
it again it's also guarded with RFID
blocking technology your contactless
cards will be kept safe and protected
from electronic pickpockets the lock is
made out of metal for maximum
reliability
it is extremely handy thanks to its fan
shape interior giving easy access to all
your cards which are stored and well
sorted it can hold US dollars and euros
and fit up to twelve cards we've been
working on this idea for the past two
years with professional engineers to
reinvent and develop the locking system
to adapt it to a wallet
it's very light and strong thanks to its
conception and high-quality material
if you're an adventurer you know the
anxiety that comes with running out of
water in the middle of a tour the last
thing you want is dehydration when
you're miles away from home Pontus is a
self doing water bowl that allows you to
plan your adventures without having to
worry about heavy water loads or where
to find the next river or the next gas
station hi I'm Christopher and I'm the
mentor of Pontus I wanted to create a
bottle that would never run dry for me
it's like magic because out of thin air
and Sun we are bringing this bottle to
fill itself with drinkable world we
created a compact small and efficient
technology completely independent and
easy to use
hi I'm Ryan I'm an electrical engineer
we develop a self-sufficient system
which uses a cooler to condense the
moisture from the air hi I'm Brian in
charge of engineering and developer
father's comes in two variations photos
ride is designed for bikers and uses the
air stream to press air into the bottle
the font is Aero is the second version
and is a standalone unit that does not
need to be in motion to function
Oh
this is John while his neighbor is
yelling about how his dog ate his paper
this is John in the same situation using
brick so what is brick so it's an
awesome version of building blocks that
makes your designs come to life with
electricity sensors and Bluetooth
let's see some prototypes from our
testing lab closing a circuit this is
Bluetooth sound sensor light sensor
proximity sensor how amazing is using
brick so this is Kate making her morning
coffee while discovering Roy used all
the milk for his cereal this is Kate
same situation with brick cell brick so
has three types of blocks connectors
action blocks and trigger blocks use the
connectors to make a circuit then embed
the action blocks to give your design
light or movement now you can use
trigger blocks to control your design
with sound proximity and light Rick so
can also be controlled remotely which
means you can connect your design to
your phone and even to the Internet and
automate stuff if you're into that sort
of thing but who likes to automate stop
right oh and there's a battery block
which will is the battery here's Mike
while his coworker turns off the air
conditioner even though it is 90 degrees
outside this is Mike same situation with
brick so you can use brick so to upgrade
designs made with regular building
blocks which will make them like a
hundred times cooler no wires needed Oh
brick so block components are built in
brick so is also an amazing educational
tool for your kids but know that they'll
forever mock regular building blocks
buzz and Amir have been working on brick
so for a long time they're both
physicists so they know a thing or two
about electricity so if you like
building stuff and don't mind getting
addicted support them and get your own
brick so it'll change your life
or just make you happy
you
this is Nuria the first window air
conditioner designed with you in mind
Nuria is 40% smaller than standard air
conditioners and less than six inches
tall unlike typical window air
conditioners Nuria lets you keep your
view Nuria is smart using Android or iOS
users can control Nuria remotely or set
a schedule to save power when Nona's
home
noria can bring fresh air into your home
on those cool September nights not even
central air can do that you don't have
to be a bodybuilder to install Nuria the
lightweight frame is installed first
making secure installation a breeze
other window air conditioners force you
to hold a heavy awkward object in place
for minutes at a time with Nuria
installation is a one-person job storage
is easy allowing you to keep it under
the bed when not needed
meet flip flick a simple device that
automates your window blinds no need to
change your existing blinds and just
clip it and it works now your blinds
move by themselves even before you think
of it
flip flick is triggered by built-in
light and temperature sensors it rotates
the existing tilting mechanism to open
and close the blinds automatically and
with the solar panel charging you don't
need to worry about battery life set
your comfort temperature in the app and
flip flick will make sure it never gets
too cold or too hot the scheduled flip
flick to wake you up in the morning
control it instantly with a tap when
you're at home when you're away leave it
to work on sensors so your pets are not
left in the dark
since when was coding this cool
introducing the latest advancement in
the field of fun meet Cody bot designed
by Meg block this smart robot teaches
kids the basics in computer programming
using a simple graphic programming
language similar to MIT scratch you can
give the robot a series of commands then
immediately see the magic happen this
provides a safe and easy introduction to
the language and mindset of computer
programmers in free play mode you can
just start playing every spin grin dance
and silly voice kangas fine
naturally teaches coding skills you can
customize Cody BA in so many ways or
here - Cody bots together for battle
mode may the best Cody Botwin Cody bond
is an open platform to learn explore and
discover equip your child with the
fundamentals they need to thrive in the
age of robotics with Cody body</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
