space-saving device times have changed
but not for brooms and dustpans until
now we've changed everything and you're
gonna love it
introducing the wisp cleaning system the
evolution of the broom and dustpan
regular brooms can sling and push dirt
everywhere with an inefficient two
handed side-by-side sweeping motion and
with a dustpan you Bend and squat
stressing your back and needs but the
wisp system is different to whisk
precisely channels and controls debris
while you're standing upright you'll
find it's perfect for all clean ups big
or small cleaning deep into grout lines
along floorboards and around and under
furniture on carpet the bristles build
electrostatic energy that captures pet
hair like nothing else even hazardous
glass and ceramic shards have nowhere to
hide from Lewis before if I broke a
glass I would pick up the big pieces I
would sweep then vacuum to get all the
slivers now all I need is the wist the
wisps bristles are like nothing else in
the world and the wisp pad is the most
highly engineered disposal tool ever
created the West is intentionally
designed to be ultra lightweight so you
can clean one-handed with long gliding
strokes the less pressure you apply the
better the results and with the West pan
there's no bending and backaches a light
step on the handle creates downward
directional pressure that seals the
leading edge onto the floor from maximum
debris capture trapping dirt in the
short indestructible bristles so debris
is efficiently collected right into the
whisk pan nothing is plugged back into
the air cleaning has
never been so easy simply slide the wisp
and with your foot from mess to mass and
keep your hands clean and away from the
dirt and debris while the reservoir
holds it all in place until you're ready
to empty it and when cleaning it's done
store until next time with the wisp away
sleeve all you do is dump the wisp an
out and snap it back onto the wisp and
hang them up nothing is easier faster
for more effortless than the West get a
wisp and never have to worry over a mess
