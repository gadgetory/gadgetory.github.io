the ground and seeing the world from
above where would you go what would you
see introducing a truly immersive flying
experience flyby is the world's first
drone that gives you an out of body
flying sensation how do we do it the
revolutionary first-person goggles give
you that bird's eye view with the
ability to really look around and
explore from the sky a gyro located
inside the goggles mirrors your head
movements and flybys built in 1080p 12
megapixel camera with internal memory
storage but what about style flyby will
be available in four unique colors fly
where you want to fly can see what you
want to see in style that's what the
flyby is all about with flyby you'll
love the flying experience and with your
support will make your dream a reality
this is the hoverboard the essence of
pure motion captured refined and
reinvented the hoverboard translates
your will into motion a single point of
contact with the ground minimizes
friction and freeze your movement from a
linear path inside precision sensors and
electronics smooth and stabilized you
arrive gently accelerating in whichever
direction you leave the controls are
intuitive gently apply pressure to one
end of the board to accelerate lean
gently to one side to the other to turn
in that direction when you stop you can
set the board down on its side to
dismount the electric motor powers a top
speed of 20 miles per hour perfectly
balancing safety with efficiency at
every turn
the hoverboard moves you but it's also a
part of you with endless personalization
options to make your hoverboard a
perfect fit for you built-in speakers
pair with your smartphone giving you the
perfect soundtrack for your daily
commute or weekend Joyride on board
lighting gives you visibility at night
letting you ride a cloud of light to
your destination the hoverboard is
perfectly balanced in both form and
function it's fully electronic whisper
quiet and amazingly efficient the
high-capacity battery takes you 15 to 20
miles on a single charge and the best
part it's not just an idea we are riding
the experience today this is the Trident
I'd open ROV we believe that exploits
just not just about gathering data but
also about experiencing new worlds in a
new way we've designed trident to be
extremely fun to fly most ROV they move
up and down slowly they go left and ride
for reverse Trident is nothing like that
it flies like an airplane if it speeds
along you can bank you can die it's fun
to fly it goes fast when you wanted to
but it could slow down and be precise we
have something you want to inspect
getting video from underwater has always
been a challenge because radio waves
don't travel through water so we've
developed a very lightweight neutrally
blamed Heather which communicates the
video feed from the bar o be up to the
surface that catches to a wireless
booing which allows you to control the
ROV from any Wi-Fi connected device a
tablet a laptop or even a VR device like
an oculus rift or Google cardboard we
wanted an ROV that could go to places
that no ROV had been before so we
designed it to be ultra portable whether
you're hiking to high alpine lakes or
you're bringing this is carry-on luggage
it goes wherever you go magic stick the
most powerful PC stick ever made the
first to run the all-new 14 nanometer
Intel cherry trail processor an ultra
fast USB 3.1 with over 10 gigabytes per
second speed transform your TV screen
into a powerful computer that can do
virtually anything control your magic
stick using your mobile phone
run Windows 10 and Android use your
favorite apps play HD games on a big
screen 4k video streaming and watching
shop online on your TV copy files in the
blink of an eye easily portable for both
work and meetings
cutting-edge innovation technology
shouldn't be cold and unreachable it
should be fun and part of daily life
this is e star's world first holographic
smartphone so how do we generate
glossary holograms on smartphones when
we're looking at our smartphone a camera
will quickly track our I'm ooh I
tracking data is sent to our own ship
signal processing unit
it's quickly processed by our eye
tracking system which will lock on to
where eyes are looking this is very
important our eye tracking system will
adjust the hologram generated based on
where your eyes are looking and you'll
immediately see the holographic left
this is the world's first holographic
smartphone with our pioneering I
tracking technology an innovation
dedicated to the smartphone application
we call this smart holographics you'll
find four cameras on a holographic firm
a perfect air interface the dual lens
camera on the back is not just for
taking holographic images but more
importantly it's designed to collect and
process holographic data
so what new user experience will such an
innovative holographic smartphone bring
us no more dizziness or narrow viewing
angles when watching movies in 3d a
truly immersive way to watch videos in
3d game playing becomes more fun and
thrilling distance is no longer a
problem lifelike product displays for
online shopping
complex traffic systems become easy to
navigate education is no longer boring
but fun and lively anytime anywhere 3d
scanning and printing well this is just
the beginning eastar will continue to
create new technologies for holographic
applications we make the impossible
possible and create better life Angie hi
max welcome home the essence of home
security is simple you need to know
what's going on at home even when you're
not there did you know that even if you
have an alarm system forty-one percent
of attempted burglaries happened when
the alarm system isn't on that's because
classic security systems are
unsophisticated and frustrating to use I
mean who wants to tap a keypad every
time you step outside and even if the
alarm is on classic systems can't tell
you who's in the house whether it's a
spooky cat burglar ninja or just a gram
I dropping off her famous casserole

grandma but really why is your
smartphone smarter than your home
security system meet Angie world's first

shaving as we know it is far from
perfect hip causes razor burn ingrown
hair cuts bleeding and even infection
and if you have sensitive skin or a skin
condition it's even more difficult the
US alone throws out two billion raises
the year most can't be recycled because
they pose a health risk so they end up
in garbage dogs there must be a better
way can we create the racer that does
not cause irritation a razor that shaves
smoother chrome a razor that helps
reduce waste this is why we created the
score appraiser was working on lasers
for cosmetic and medical purposes I
wondered could I put this technology to
better use I wanted something that would
benefit every single one of us shaving
what's the obvious officer the industry
has been looking for a laser shaker for
home use but discovering a viable
technology has eluded everyone until now
wavelengths of light have been to stop
at the cut through dark hair but not
liked or gray hair we wanted a laser
that could cut all hair many prototypes
were built and after years of
experimentation we had fun exactly what
we were looking for we identified
molecules in the hair that observe a
particular wavelength these are called
chromatophores this chroma force are the
only continuous structure in the hair
their shared by every human regardless
of age gender and portrays the scalp
razor is for everyone to use and it
works great on any area</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
