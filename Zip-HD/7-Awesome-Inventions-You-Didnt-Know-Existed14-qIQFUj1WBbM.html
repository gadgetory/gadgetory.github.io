sesame is what's called a smartlock
which means you can unlock it using your
phone as the key I've tried other smart
laws they're way too big
they're apps are confusing they take too
long to connect and they're hassle to
install I'm pretty handy sesame is
different you can install it in seconds
literally no one's screwing no replacing
sesame has a patented design that fits
any latch anywhere in the world the app
is handsome and intuitive but you can
open your door without it like this or
like this
sesame senses when my phone is nearby
and gets ready for my special nook and I
can get the optional Wi-Fi access point
it plugs into the wall nearby so sesame
is always on my home network and it's
linked to the access point with
Bluetooth which keeps it connected while
going easy on the batteries there with
no keys it's easy to let other people in
to
I can choose who has access and who
doesn't I get notifications when my lock
opens and closes so I can always know
what's going on no matter where I am and
it's got military-grade encryption
no one's hacking this
popular understanding of obstructive
sleep apnea is that the soft tissue in
your throat sort of collapses it
typically does that sort of at the end
of your breath and so continuous
positive airway pressure blows enough
air into your nose or your mouth into
your body to supply all of the air that
you need in an inhalation plus a little
bit more so it actually builds up a
little pressure and it's that pressure
that sort of keeps the soft tissue apart
traditional CPAP machines what a big
mask on your faith and with a rubber
seal around it and strap it on really
tight and are blowing air constantly at
you that's the tendency to drive
people's sinuses out they cannot
tolerate it when I first talked to
people about the airing device and I say
well you know we have these little micro
pumps and and it turns out that they're
very powerful and they can they can pump
the right amount of air at the right
amount of pressure to treat sleep apnea
and people just kind of what you can't
do that and I go well yes I think we can
because how it works is these little
micro blowers are basically like a
bellows you know like you you fan the
fire in your fireplace technically it's
called a displacement problem but
basically we use electrostatic charge
maybe in school you might remember they
showed you magnets you know the North
Pole gets to you know attracted to the
South Pole and like poles repel same way
with charges like charges repel opposite
charges attract so if you have two
bellows or two plates there's a space
between them and when they're attracted
together they displace the air between
them and when they're pulled apart or
repelled from each other they suck air
in and because they're so small that's
not much air but if you put another one
next to it
and another one next to that it's called
parallel if you put a lot of these in
parallel then you can start to suck a
reasonable amount of air into them and
blow a reasonable amount of error
them so thousands of times a second
these little Punk's are pumping air so
massively parallel and many many times a
second gets you the right amount of flow
rate so when the micro blowers are on
when they want to provide air for your
breathing
the air from the room is sucked into the
micro blower out the other side and up
to the nose
if you're going to design the device
that runs on a battery then you have to
choose a battery technology that has a
lot of stored energy in it and so that's
why we chose the zinc-air battery which
is like a hearing aid battery it is the
most volumetric ly energetic that means
it has the most stored energy for the
volume and the way they have enough
energy to run this little micro blowers
in the new device for eight hours every
night
