everyone loves outdoor activities but
with all that fun comes all that cleanup
that's why I created the rent kit it's
like having a hose to go my name is
Chris Crawford and after countless hours
of developing I've created something
that is truly revolutionary rinse kit is
super easy to use to fill it simply
attach the quick connect adapter to any
sink or hose bib turn on the water it
will fill in 30 seconds attach the
nozzle and it's ready to go
there's no pumping or batteries required
it uses no moving parts and it will hold
the water pressure for months
ok so right now you're probably asking
yourself how in the heck does this thing
work inside the rinse kit there's a
sealed chamber when you connect it to a
hose bib the water pressure from your
home simply compresses the air in the
chamber the best part about this design
is that it essentially uses the air as a
spring there's nothing to wear out we
specifically designed the rinse kit to
be easy to carry and travel with it
holds two gallons of water which will
spray for over five minutes on the
center setting and for over thirty
minutes on the mist setting the lid
detaches so you can clean up and change
on it you can also use it as a cutting
board or to sit on as you rinse off your
feet
rinse kit is BPA free so it's safe to
drink out of
and it's extremely durable you really
can't hurt this thing
throughout the years mankind has pursued
their outdoor passions and has suffered
unnecessarily we've always felt that the
risk it could be the ultimate portable
shower if it could make its own hot
water but our early attempts to heat the
water in the rinse kit were a little
impractical finally we figured it out
we developed a heating probe that drops
into the tank and runs off a
rechargeable battery it quickly heats
the water in the tank to a nice
comfortable shower temperature i even
included a smart USB port for charging
your devices
you
whether everyday outdoorsman or weekend
warriors we want to stay connected to
our devices you take our phones GPS
camera and electronics with us in our
outdoor adventures so we never miss a
moment and we can eventually navigate
our way home but we realized that our
devices were having a tough time keeping
up with a subset from batteries that run
out halfway through the day to phone the
can't withstand more than a drop of
water we couldn't believe there wasn't a
way for us to keep the devices we rely
on alive so we came up with a solution
Rock pack pioneers use the world's first
solar battery pack dry box all in one
product a rugged waterproof storage
solution with an integrated battery and
a solar panel with easy to open latches
you have instant access your device's
performance charge two devices at one
keep all your devices charged no matter
where you are our smart charging
technology allows you to charge of
advice instead giving you power one unit
