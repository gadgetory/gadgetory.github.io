objects directly from your smartphone
for under $100 Olo is the first
smartphone powered 3d printer simple and
affordable
although uses the light from the screen
of your smartphone to print 3d objects
half of its hardware is already in your
pocket
although works with phones of all sizes
its app is available for iOS Android and
Windows Phone creating 3d objects is as
simple as picking a design from all
those easy to use library or you can use
any 3d mobile app including 3d scanning
to make your own you can also choose
designs from the web that are created by
others or shared via social media
Olo can print files from the 3d design
software of your choice
select your object or in the resin and
Ollo does the rest
Ola uses a special photo polymeric resin
although prints are designed by using
the light from the screen of your
smartphone to harden the liquid resin
layer by layer
Olo can even print multiples of the same
object or several different objects all
at the same time after all the prints
your 3d object all you need to do is
rinse it under warm water
Olo has different resins for different
jobs
although can print hard objects and
flexible ones
although even has a castable resin that
can be fused so you can create an object
in silver and gold or other casting
metals all those resins can be used to
print translucent models to light up
your designs
polar resins are available in a variety
of colors and are priced competitively
with other common 3d printing materials
anyone can use old
all you need is creativity with Ollo you
can exchange creations with people all
over the world you can even send a
surprise gift to someone special that
can only be revealed by printing it
this is ding there's nothing in the
world he loves more than 3d printer
today he's trying out the dryness 3d
printer try this a new 3d printer these
days he's not just looking for another
3d printer he wants something that
produces quality prints can work with a
wide variety of materials can print with
multiple file formats is reliable and
doesn't cost an arm and a leg he's had
some trying experiences putting together
printers with hundreds of parts and
having to recalibrate them over and over
again or coping with prices that put him
over the edge
Shriners has a modular structure with
four identical units which reduces its
production cost yeah that's it only 11
parts sorry with an easy-to-follow
manual you can assemble chiness in 30
minutes and because it's mechanics or
scaled-down from industrial grade
machines trynna Springs professional
level performance and precision right to
your desk trying this isn't just a fix
package either you can exchange its 3d
printing head for a laser engraving one
you can also equip your try this with a
heated bed and safety enclosure opening
your printer up to PC and abs now Dave
how much do you think this cost
nope look right there's no cash $299 on
Kickstarter shrine Asst uses its
intuitive pango software which works
twice as fast as other slicers but
you're not locked to that other software
in g-code are compatible to remember the
time you use the high-speed setting on
that other low-cost printer and ended up
with a dull messy print even using a
higher print speed tryna give you a
clean high-quality print without shaking
everything off your desk plus the laser
head will come in handy when your best
friend beats you in a game you thought
you are good at tryna slette you print
with many different elements including
flex wood and aluminum all without a
jammed extruder or clogged nozzle to
help achieve that trine is partnered
with Polly Maker with their poly Maxx
PLA or PC plus you can be sure that your
printed parts will be stronger and
better than ever before
I can explain
there are currently three main problems
with the technologies used by our
competitors small printing size long
printing time and low resolution in
terms of printing size Titan one can
print up to nine and a half inches tall
with a 7.5 4x4 point two five inch build
base at a hundred micron XYZ resolution
which is the tallest among all personal
SLA printers for the SLA printers out in
the market today to print a nine and a
half inch Eiffel Tower with a hundred
micron Z resolution it takes anywhere
from fifteen to twenty hours with Titan
one it only takes about seven hours for
a 4.7 inch tall Eiffel Tower it only
takes two hours last but definitely not
least Titan one can print at resolutions
that are five times better than FDM
printers at higher speed we can print
piller features as fine as a strand of
hair this small Eiffel Tower and the
Rings are printed at 37 micron XYZ
resolution Titan one is the most
flexible and adjustable a desktop SLA
printer for multiple purposes some 3d
printers focuses on resolution but are
only able to prints my objects on the
other hand other printers can only print
large objects while sacrificing
resolution type the one is specifically
designed for users to easily make
adjustments with the widest range
printing sizes in the market today
Titan one is so flexible that it can
print larger objects and can be adjusted
to increase resolution and print smaller
objects speed resolution and size can be
optimized based on user preferences what
the Titan one you can be a creative for
anything jewelry forgery designers
artwork for artists models and
prototypes for architects and designers
molds parts and prototypes for engineers
and product designers design and
research models for teachers and
students and many other uses including
prototyping and samples small businesses
and niche applications such as hearing a
mold and dental study models a fun fact
about type tou1 is that you can easily
take out the commercial grade HD
projector and use it to project HD
movies and have your own home theater in
order to help spread the SLA technology
kudo 3d further improves on two big
problems with the current SLA process
reliability and cost structure first to
improve the reliability and relaxed
feature maintenance burden we modularize
the components for Titan 1 Titan 1 is
simple elegant and easy to use we use
high quality DLP HD 1080p projector an
industrial grade high precision ball
screw linear stage that are used in
semiconductor equipment who taught 3ds
engineering team spent 16 months
full-time to develop and perfect the
patent-pending passive self peeling
technology to minimize the separation
force of cured layers GSP employs a
flexible resin container consisting of
five different materials to enable a
self appealing process that minimizes
the separation force therefore features
as tiny as a strand of hair can be
preserved during the printing process
since our PSP technology employed teflon
our container is immune to the attack of
more reactive resin that happens to most
of our competitors users can use
materials from any vendors by setting
proper exposure times as an artist I'm
always searching for new mediums to
experiment with and recently I've
discovered graphic art but I've been
getting frustrated by its
two-dimensional limitations which is why
I'm extremely excited about the release
of the Titan one and to translate the
high resolution quality the C
of the titan-1 into my art I mean it'll
take my creativity to
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
