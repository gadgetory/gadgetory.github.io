constantly evolving phones have become
handheld computers cars are smarter and
cleaner watches it turned into personal
assistance but what about our shoes we
spent most of our lives wearing them but
besides fashion designs they have seen
little evolution in the last few decades
we bend over to tie them to untie them
they come undone they get stuck in our
bike chain we leave the laces tied all
the time and damage our shoes sure
we have velcro shoes and zippers but you
still have to bend over and they don't
fit nearly as firmly as good old laces
at power lace we wanted to figure out a
way to create shoes that fit firmly and
comfortably without ever having to lace
or unlace them we decided to think
differently and we found a solution we
are proud to introduce the p1 our new
Auto lacing system allows for efficient
hands-free shoelace time the first time
you wear them slide your foot in adjust
the tension once and you're set you'll
never have to bend over again to take
off the shoes use your other foot to
press down on the back lever it's that
simple it's a nice product it's very
streamlined it's not bulky a thin sole a
lot of companies have big bulky soles
kevlar lace on any product definitely
in working industry for 25 years I've
seen two pairs of killers is broken
powerless shoes will simplify tasks of
everyday life allowing you to take
advantage of a snug shoe fit while on
the go
what if your coffee table and your
dinner table were one in the same for
the past 60 years transformable tables
have been using variations of the same
system introducing bulan Blancos a
revolutionary table that transforms your
interior in one simple move we kept the
table as light as possible so one person
could operate the transformation easily
from a dinner table to a coffee table
all in an instant use the lower position
to lounge with your friends use the
upper position to work one table two
positions two different styles a product
that adapts to your needs and transforms
your interior
I love my laptop I rely on it every day
and I take it everywhere but
economically laptops are not ideal
the longer we spend on them the more we
hunch leading to tension or pain in our
neck the shoulders and back which is why
we've designed the Tiny Tower a portable
and height adjustable laptop stair the
tiny tower allows you to set up and get
to work in no time whether it's at the
office at home in a cafe or wherever it
has an elegant design which integrates
beautifully with your laptop helping you
work comfortably and protect your
posture I suffered a serious disc
herniation in my neck
after hunching over my laptop for too
long I realized that a lot of existing
products don't really solve the problem
and they're not something I want on my
desk so as an industrial designer I
decided to create a product that laptop
users would be proud to own the tiny
Tower has a clever push-button mechanism
that adjusts your laptop screen to a
height that suits you there are 10
different height levels about
when you're done it takes a seconds to
fall down flat into a compact and
lightweight unit that you can take
anywhere it's compatible with both Mac
and Windows laptops from 11 to 15 inches
in size your laptop sits firmly and
securely on a non-slip grip all for
added security
the tiny Tower has fingers you can
extend
cork is the world's first micro
Bluetooth speaker that enhances sound
depth and quality by upcycling bottles

lifestyle and environmental
consciousness cork looks good on any
bottle while enriching lifestyles of
users with new ways to enjoy music

friends or jamming out on my own
cork is the perfect addition to any
scenario when the sound on my phone
isn't loud enough and I want that extra
boost I use cork in the studio I don't
always have access to the sound system
but with cork
I don't have to worry about that Kirk's
small size makes it easy to listen to my
music without the other package what I
really love is the opportunity to give
my used bottles a second life
I can experiment with different shapes
sizes and materials to produce a variety
of sound types and using cork is simple
turn on your device to pair it via
bluetooth play your music and pop cork
onto a bottle to enjoy some deep
amplified set quirk is smaller and
lighter than other Bluetooth speakers so
it's easy to transport I keep mine in my
bag so I can use it whenever I want cork
has managed to simplify medicine and
experience without compromising on style
it's polish design blends perfectly into
my lifestyle even if I don't have any
bottles around me I can always put cork
down on the floor cork comes with two
interchangeable silicone cradles that
mount onto a variety of different bottle
types
once mounted cork turns any up cycle to
use bottle
- a beautiful speaker try both silicone
cradles to see which one you prefer when
you're done simply detach the cradles
and rinse in water course intuitive
design makes it extremely user friendly
a simple push of one button is all you
need to access its functions and with up
to 10 hours of play time cork is the
perfect speaker for any occasion
different bottles produce a range of
unique sound types experiment to see how
various shapes sizes and materials

attractive colors gray red black and

product that sounds great but looks
great - cork gives you the opportunity
to recycle your old bottles and give
them a second life 100% guilt free
entertainment

experience

I hate peeling boiled eggs so we solved
the problem this is called an egg maker
what it does is it peel as a boiled egg
very simple watch this take the boiled
egg put it in the jar with a little bit
of water in there put the top on and
guess what all you do is shake that's it
nothing complicated and watch what
happens
somebody called this magic I think there
right there is the perfect filled egg hi
my name is Matthew Michael and I'm the
inventor of whisk wiper whisk wiper was
an idea that came to me while it was
cleaning a whisk in my sink wiping each
loop between my fingers one at a time I
simply wondered why can't I wipe them
all at once everyone knows that cleaning
a whisk is a pain and that using one is
messy setting the whisk down means a
dirty counter in a dirty whisk whisk
wiper makes whisking easy to use it
insert the whisk and whisk wiper taking
a moment to line up the loops then whisk
away
it keeps the loops up off the counter
and it even catches drips you can rest
the whisk on the edge of the bowl or on
the edge of the sink but when you're
done instead of washing all of that food
and water down the drain
simply pull whisk wiper off and return
95% of the food to the bowl but that's
not all save every last bit using this
wiper to wipe out the bore but even get
square corners whisk wafer is a real
time-saver more hygienic and I'm proud
of the food water getting the product to
this point has been a wonderful
experience working with some very
talented people I made the first
prototype on an automotive gasket in a
cardboard mold and it still works great
industrial designer robert Apodaca
created a more functional and aesthetic
design and our mechanical engineer
carpet the Sony refine the engineering
for manufacture and elevations were
added to ensure clean lines and the over
holding our objection molding is being
done here in Los Angeles with Greg
Layton and CNG mercury plastics who've
been here since 1947
we even found the best whisks in the
world in Portland Oregon where John
Merrifield and his company are
completing our 100% made in the USA
