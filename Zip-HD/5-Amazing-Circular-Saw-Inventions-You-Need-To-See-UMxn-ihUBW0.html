patented safety feature is made possible
by a sophisticated mechanism but the
concept is actually very simple the
blade carries a small electrical signal
this charge is continuously monitored by
a digital signal processor when skin
contacts the blade the signal changes
because the human body is conductive
this change in signal triggers a quick
release aluminum break a heavy-duty
spring forces the break into the teeth
of the spinning blade the teeth dig into
the aluminum stopping the blade cold the
blades momentum forces it to retract
below the table and the motor is
automatically shut off all of that
happens in less than five thousandths of
a second ten times faster than a car's
airbag all without damaging the saw it
takes less than 5 minutes to replace the
brake assembly just slip the cartridge
in put a new blade on and you're back in
business but saw stops commitment to
protecting you goes far beyond its
patented safety system with a host of
additional safety features
it's what SawStop calls total safety
it's always safer when a blade guard is
used and saw stops low-profile blade
guard combines protection and dust
collection while providing exceptional
visibility the riving knife minimizes
kickback and delivers protection during
non through cuts and since inconvenience
is often the enemy of safety saw stops
unique quick-release zero-clearance
insert enables tool free access to the
saw cavity and blade guard clamp
changing blades or switching between the
blade guard and riving knife is fast and
easy
anti-kickback Paul's provide additional
safety and can be tucked away for
cutting wood with delicate surfaces a
diagnostic self check runs continuously
to ensure all systems are ready to
detect an accident
a safety bypass which allows you to cut
conductive material without activating
the safety system and you can easily
disable the main power switch entirely
by removing the yellow key finally the
large start/stop paddle provides
hands-free shutoff allowing you to
safely stop the blade even when both
hands are busy can you do this with your
circular saw
see how cleanly extracted the subfloor
with one saw one blade and no damage to
the sheetrock wires our plumbing one saw
what about this
forget about pulling out your beam saw
or making four cuts with two different
saws I could do it with one saw in two
cuts bet your saw can't do this how fast
was that and without the waste of
material or ugly edges that can be
created by reciprocating saw what if you
could do this
I just cut that rim joist without
marking or chalking any lines try that
with any other saw could you even think
about doing this with your circular saw
how many times would you have to pull
out your tape measure just to cut these
floor joists 10 20 times try doing it
without measuring at all and try doing
this with your old circular saw I used
to have to do this by hand or switch to
an undercut so now I just rotate my
handle 90 degrees for a perfect one pass
under cuts and only a few seconds now
would you believe that you could do all
these things and more with just one saw
all while significantly reducing
construction costs believe it
