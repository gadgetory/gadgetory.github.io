charge the devices have evolved but the
charging technology has not until now

this is snap tip without switching to a

you'll have a beautiful Polaroid photo
of your phone screen snapjet is a slim
portable instant film printer for your
smartphone it's like a tiny photocopy
machine you can bring anywhere the best
thing about snapchat is its simplicity
all you need to do is put your phone on
top press one button and you get a
flawless photo
it doesn't need any apps wires or
bluetooth to function with snapchat the
possibilities are endless if you can see
it you can print it
imagine a birthday card with a selfie
that was taken 30 seconds ago well what
about printing a custom business card at
your next meeting snapchats text is
sharp and clear never be caught with an
outdated business card again and next
time instead of running a giant
expensive photobooth for your special
occasion why not use a snapchat instead
snapchat prints on Fuji Instax or
polaroid 300 film and its innovative
design can support any smartphone
polaroid is near and dear to my heart as
a photographer I was just really excited
about working with instant film again
and I loved that snapchat was
incorporating the use of a smart phone
because it's just so convenient to take
photos we wanted something that pushed
the limits of what's possible with
instant film like digital effects
fluorescent ink a pocket video that
doesn't require a single battery
lenticular film and transparencies that
come to life with an Arduino and some
simple LEDs hey guys Ryan here at Road
microphones and this is the videomic me
it's the latest addition to our video
micro age of microphones and it's
designed to help you get better audio in
the videos that you shoot every single
day on your smartphone now the videomic
me is a directional microphone that's
designed to help you get better audio
directly with any video shot on your iOS
or Android device it's a directional
microphone and it actually cancels out
sound that comes in from the rear of the
microphone and only picks up the sound
in the direction that you want to record
so whether you're mounting the phone and
recording directly in front of you in
cancer
any sense from behind you or whether
you're mounting it in selfie mode and
wanting to cancel out any of the sounds
in front of you like crowd noise or
traffic noise and the videomic me is a
perfect mic to get rid of those sounds
that you don't like now the back of the
mic is a headset output jack so that you
can actually listen to the audio as you
record it and make sure that you're
getting exactly what you want
now often what happens when you're
recording outdoors in a windy
environment you'll often hear the wind
reacting with a microphone making it
really rumbly and very hard to hear so
to combat that we're actually supplying
it with a wind sock which goes straight
onto the end of the microphone and it
means that you can record even in very
windy environments outside and get
totally clean audio the video mic me is
designed to fit a wide range of
different devices including both iOS and
Android devices
as long as the headset input on the
device is on the opposite side to the
actual camera itself purely so that you
don't see the microphone when you're
filming straight ahead now it comes with
a little adjustment on the back so that
it can be mounted on a wide range of
different devices regardless of whether
you have a case on or not that mount can
be simply adjusted by just twisting it
off and then squeezing it on against the
body of the device itself to get it to
the perfect thickness and keep it there
nice and secure so there you have it
guys that's the videomic me I think it's
time to all get much better audio with
the videos that we're shooting every
single day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
