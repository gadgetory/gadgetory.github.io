engaging two opposing calls at the same
time making it powerful enough to break
free even the most stubborn bolts
traditional wrenches require the
mechanism to advance one full tooth in
order to engage or click the skx frame

you advance one third of the tooth the
next pair engages to give you more
precision at any given time a pair of
Paul's are fully locked in with the
teeth at that same time the next set of
Paul's are almost engaged and ready to
secure the last pair of Paul's are
unengaged but as the mechanism continues
to advance these Paul's will be ready to
lock in having a new set of Paul's lock
each time the wrench turns just one
third of a tooth gives you finer
engagement than any other wrench this
engagement system gives a total of 216
positions for the lowest dark swing in
the industry this stronger mechanism
