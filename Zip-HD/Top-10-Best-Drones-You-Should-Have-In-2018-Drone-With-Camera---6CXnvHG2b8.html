revolution it turned tens of thousands
of people into aerial filmmakers and now
appears on professional film sets around
the world the inspire tube builds on
this foundation empowering filmmakers to
be more creative than ever
whether flying as a team or operating as
a single pilot a dedicated to access
stabilized fpv camera with independently
adjustable pitch gives the pilot a
personal live feed bring the camera off
to move any way they need to to get the
shot top speed is boosted to 58 miles
per hour 94 km/h and ascent and descent
is also accelerating the speed doesn't
come without protection
DJI is unmatched flight autonomy system
comes to inspire to bringing with it an
extended range close to 100 feet meaning
faster flight with protection from what
it can see it also adds an infrared
sensing system placed on top the inspire
extending obstacle avoidance to
obstructions overhead
the new dual battery design increases
flight I'm hitting a maximum of 27
minutes when using the x 4's camera and
also provides battery redundancy self
heating systems mean the inspire 2 can
be flown in extreme cold the zenmuse x5
s Micro Four Thirds camera now has a
twenty point eight megapixel sensor with
better pixel performance it is capable
of capturing 5.2 K at 30 frames per
second as well as 4k at 60 frames per
second it also supports cinema DNG and
pro res recording you just kind of look
at it you go like that's really small
but how can this little small thing give
these big results normally I wouldn't
think of it using a drone for normal
shots but kind of made this really
simple shot easily you know and look
great and I'm really I'm just I'm
telling you I'm really picky the inspire
2 is DJ focus compatible for precision
focus control a broad range of Micro
Four Thirds lenses are also supported
including zooms from 9 millimeter to 45
millimeter the 45 is pretty beautiful on
this camera we use that a lot for
close-ups and as a great depth of field
and just makes me feel like you know
that's kind of cinematic permitir the
inspire 2 image processor known as cynic
or 2.0 offers cinema DNG pro res h.264
and h.265 recording onto a detachable
PCIe SSD drive with a maximum read and
write speed of 6 gigabits per second or
a micro SD card Perez is a widely used
delivery method for post-production
offering flexibility for editing while
not compromising image quality but to
get the absolute most out of what you
shoot the inspire - also captures rock
acquiring content on Raw just gives you
more information to work with in your
post process the raw native cinema DNG
format gives you the most dynamic range
possible of that camera basically takes
full advantage of the sensor and
everything that it can see there isn't
one shot that we compromised for detail
for color purity for separation and
images for black for low-light detail a
highlight detail but I never could have
told you that this particular footage
came from the drone it's just too good
new intelligent modes including
spotlight Pro and profile makes
cinematic shots easier for production
teams and even for single operators
spotlight probe keeps the camera locked
on the subject rotating beyond 360
degrees to fix a target in frame as in
spire flies while profile mode turns a
camera to capture the subjects profile
as the inspire flies forward by
maintaining forward flight obstacle
sensing systems are able to protect the
aircraft the onboard fpv camera
separates the flight view from the main
camera view effectively giving the
inspire to a dedicated tap flight camera
just tap on the screen to fly in that
direction and focus on camera control
during return to home the primary camera
with a maximum sensing range 200 meters
is used to effectively avoid
obstructions live TV broadcasting has
also been enabled natively through an
optimized broadcast mode the strings
smooth video at the 1080i50 and 720p60
live broadcast standard the inspire 2
brings better quality images more power
and more intelligence to professional
aerial filmmaking setting the stage for
more filmmakers to take to the sky what
do you need for incredible aerial
imaging a brilliant camera an aircraft
you can trust and the intelligence to
make every shot cinematic the new
phantom 4 Pro has all this and much more
The Phantom 4 pro camera has an F 2.8
apertures mechanical shutter and large
one-inch sensor coming together to make
brighter more detailed imagery record
cinematic 4k video at higher bit rates
with more advanced compression and a
wider dynamic range 4k 60 frames per
second recording gives you stunning
detailed slow-motion aerial video the
phantom 4 pro is as adept at stills as
it is with video capturing every detail
at 20 megapixels its mechanical shutter
eliminates rolling shutter bending grab
the perfect moment using burst mode
all of this makes the phantom4 pro the
most advanced aerial camera ever found
in the Phantom series The Phantom 4 pro
is now a huge step forward I'm taking
photos of the lava when it's darker out
and the glow of the lavas coming off of
it the image sensor that's in this
camera now is one temp sensor 20
megapixels that extra dynamic range
allows me to really get everything into
one shot in landscape that's extremely
important
see your shot clearly even in direct
sunlight with the new ultra bright 5.5
inch monitor that's more than twice as
bright as most tablets inside is DJI
light bridge technology it automatically
detects interference and switches from
two point four to five point eight
gigahertz transmission and take off
cutting through the noise for more
reliability the built-in monitor on the
phantom 4 pro is so bright I'm actually
able to see in direct sunlight and
that's really allowing me to compose my
shot and get what I really want to
capture active Trek has now been
expanded with three new intelligent
flight modes profile tracks your subject
horizontally from any side spotlight
locks the camera on a subject while you
fly in almost any direction circle
swings 360 degrees around the subject
Tapp fly has also been improved adding
reverse tap fly making it perfect for
aerial selfies flying The Phantom 4 Pro
is even more worryfree a set of rear
visual sensors has been added to
existing forward and downward sensors
combined with new infrared obstacle
sensors on its sides the Phantom 4 Pro
has five directions of sensing if image
signal is lost it returns home while
dynamically avoiding obstacles and even
flies back along its original flight
path until signal is regained every
minute in the air counts the new
high-capacity battery flight time has
been increased to 30 minutes when it
comes to speed the Phantom 4 Pro is ten
miles per hour faster with full support
of its obstacle sensing systems
with it's stunning camera 1 inch sensor
ultra bright monitor obstacle sensing
and intelligence the phantom 4 pro
brings professional quality aerial
imaging and flight capabilities to more
pilots around the world

perspective
because what makes this moment big and
full of life is you this freedom now
lies in your hands
what we strive for and everything that
we do is to help you capture the special
moments of your life to tell your story
we are at the forefront of electric
aviation we developed the typhoon 4k
quadcopter with the built-in camera to
capture crystal-clear 4k Ultra HD with
incredible detail it has the ability to
record in 120 frames per second slow
motion Full HD video it's easy to use
and provides a perfectly user-friendly
experience that fits in with your
lifestyle
we designed a number of smart features
that allow the typhoon to adopt to you
we have reinvented how the follow me'
feature interacts with you the software
detects where you are and follows you
automatically we are the first ones to
incorporate elevation changes so the
camera drone actually follows you as you
go up and down in geography to give you
even more artistic freedom we have
integrated the watch me feature it
allows you to concentrate completely on
what you're filming or doing while the
camera always remains directed at you
the operation of the typhoon is super
easy in the development process we put
in a lot of thought in how to make it
quick and easy to use ready to fly out
of the box in less than two minutes
our remote control is the optimum
combination of high quality material and
user oriented design with the integrated
touchscreen that's built into every unit
you have full control over camera image
and see all the important flight
parameters there is no complicated
installation of external monitors
necessary our software and hardware is
perfectly matched with professional
camera settings you can use the 4k
camera with the remote and also control
framerate resolution and exposure or do
super sharp photos just by pushing a
button
the typhoon opens completely new
perspectives for your creativity the
copters camera gimbal is a three axis
stabilization system which allows you to
make steady footage even in windy
conditions the 4k camera also has
optical compensation with a flat
wide-angle lens
this means the picture is realistic
there is no loss of quality and less
effort in post-production this makes it
possible to discover new horizons with
ease but the typhoon is more than that
with the included steady grip and the
Segoe 3 camera our product becomes an
all-in-one solution for steady air and
ground shots the modular design allows
you to switch from air to ground within
a few seconds the steady grip is a three
axis stabilizing gimbal system for your

link any smartphone becomes a portable
display via Wi-Fi with our Segoe 3
camera app you can not only control the
camera easily but also have a brilliant
picture in any situation with all
recording options the two different
modes for the steady grip makes
filmmaking more comfortable for you in
follow mode the camera follows you and
your hand movements in a smooth motion
whereas in the focus mode the target is
fixed the Typhoon's flight time is up to
an amazing 25 minutes complex maneuvers
or long pursuits are no longer a problem
in addition with each copter comes a
second battery your imagination may run
wild for a long time changing the
battery is incredibly easy the battery
compartment has an easy to open
enclosure that keeps the battery safe
during flight and allows you to change
in seconds after landing
satellite based GPS data gives your
flight better control it holds your
copter quiet and safe in the air safety
is a concern and the return to home
function brings the copter back to you
in the event of signal loss of course it
can also be used as an autopilot tool
and without the need of control with the
flip of a switch to the home position
the typhoon will return to you it's that
easy
we have designed one of the world's best
flight simulators for multicopters which
gives everyone the opportunity to get
the feel for flying without ever leaving
the ground
as part of our Quality Assurance every
copter is individually tested and must
pass our highly detailed quality
controls before leaving the factory be
adventurous unleash your creativity and
discover new perspectives your story is
worth telling your story is worth
sharing with the world come with us and
tell your story piloting drones is a
relatively new activity that most people
are starting to explore we wanted to
design a drone that introduced as many
people as possible so the first person
view drone experience without breaking
the bank
introducing a whole new flight
experience the pole is an innovative and
versatile first person view drone
available at a radical price it's a
complete ready to fly out-of-the-box
solution that's easy and safe to pilot
the drone for everyone there are three
ways to fly first for beginners to start
flying simply turn on the drone and turn
on the controller the two will sync up
and pair and you can takeoff the drone
features altitude stabilization and a
beginner's mode that makes picking up
the basics of breeze learn how to safely
and confidently maneuver and control
your drone next for those ready to
expand their horizons attach the screen
to the controller and start piloting the
drone further away simply turn on the
drone and the screen the camera on the
drone will automatically sync and
broadcast a live high-definition feed
mount the screen on the controller and
you're ready to go
finally for those ready for the whole
first person you experience swap the
screen into the goggles and prepare for
a whole new flight experience immerse
yourself into the world of fpv piloting
and cruise around high in the sky or try
your hand at fpv drone racing and
experience the incredible excitement
from every twist and turn drone racing
is a new and exciting sport that is
quickly growing around the world using
fpv goggles pilots race their drones
around courses to compete for the
fastest times it is truly the sport of
the future the bolt can be used to
experience drone racing at a fraction of
the current price it's an exciting
virtual reality flying experience the
bolt drone was designed and tested in
Los Angeles by a team of expert product
designers aerospace engineers and drone
enthusiasts it's built on a carbon fiber
frame that offers unmatched performance
and durability the HD camera provides
crystal-clear video and photos and the
battery easily slides in and out for
quick swapping the drone design is
modular so that individual parts can be
replaced the result is a highly a
maneuver bowl lightweight and
aerodynamic drone the bolt features a
unique and innovative fpv viewing system
that allows seamless transition from
traditional viewing on the controller to
fpv viewing using goggles we're excited
to offer the bolt drone at a radical
price traditionally consumers purchase
their drones at a high price point since
importers wholesalers and retailers mark
up the price of a drone up to five
hundred percent by cutting out the
middlemen we are able to sell directly
to you and pass on the savings the bolt
drone was designed to introduce as many
people as possible to first-person view
piloting and racing without breaking the
bank
introducing looming a cutting-edge
gaming drone Lumi is a highly advanced
yet easy to fly quadcopter that self
stabilizes
follows you plays games and is
programmable we set out to create a
whole new experience with drone flights
by making it accessible to everyone
kids adults boys and girls Lumi is ready
to go right out of the box simply insert
a battery turn on the beacon load the
app and press take off performing stunts
flying landing all happen at the touch
of a button
after removing the complexity of flight
our team began to push the boundaries of
what drones could really do and we place
our focus on creating a new genre of
drone
game a fight flight movie to the beat is
about rhythm and reflexes quickly match
the color of the drones led to the
corresponding color on your app as you
advance the game speeds up and you
unlock new tricks keep up with the beat
to stay airborne if you make a mistake
the drone drops when you hit the ground
the game is over we understand that
gaming is more fun in numbers so we
wanted to make flying a drone more than
just a solo event with spectators we
wanted to create a true multiplayer
experience so everyone can get in on the
action
Lumi is a programmable drone in
choreography mode you have the unique
capability to create timeline sequences
by combining multiple moves and actions
LED controls with music from your
personal library press play and watch
Lumi move to the beat of the chosen song
while performing your created sequence
last but certainly not least we tackled
follow me and perfected what others have
tried to accomplish simply tap the
button
pick up the beacon and louny will follow
your every move this long-awaited
feature is finally a reality
hi I'm Sydney and this is Davin we
noticed that many people having a hard
time getting a hang of flying
quadcopters broken propellers dead
batteries people weren't really able to
climb the learning curve and really get
the handle on on flying RC controls quad
copters well the drone market is flooded
with quad copters we really saw this as
a place where we could add value we
wanted to create something that is
affordable easy to fly but above all
really fun and that's how Loney came to
be
we took our latest and greatest sensors
sensors that allow a quadcopter to know
where it is in 3-space we added in some
gesture and obstacle avoidance sensors
and we've create a platform where you
can literally have a quadcopter fly
itself while you build a game so we have
games already but we really feel that
we've only scratched the surface and
we're turning to you guys you guys are
super innovative and you guys embrace
tech and we'd love to see what you're
able to come up with in terms of how to
gamify flight will provide you with
smart beacons will provide you with
plumie with live telemetry data
streaming to your computer you'll be
able to build iOS or Android apps
natively and come up with all kinds of
cool games by backing this project not
only will you get access to this
exclusive developer kit but you'll also
get Lumi before everyone else and at a
super affordable price and we're really
psyched to see you guys come up with and
where this goes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
