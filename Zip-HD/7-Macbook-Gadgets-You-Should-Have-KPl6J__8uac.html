Holthus vultus provides power and
expansion for the devices you use
everyday it has a high-capacity battery
that lets you charge your MacBook and
any USB device the gadgets you own
aren't compatible with a new MacBook but
Voltas fixes them it has a high-speed
USB hub that lets you connect any device
like flash drives cameras and
smartphones when you're at home Voltas
connects your power cord to your macbook
staying fully charged and ready to go
the
and new math book one of the many new
devices featuring the powerful new USB
type-c port your entire computer's power
data transfer and output through a
single port it's the heights of
technological simplicity but what about
your stuff and when you need to
multitask how do you fit it all into a
single port your stuff needs marble the
first integrated system designed to work
with the USBC port
the marvel offers a single compact way
to connect your many devices to your new
math book it's got two USB ports two USB
sea ports an HDMI type-a port a micro SD
card reader and a 60 watt AC Inlet to
power it all it's the only system made
to charge your new macbook while also
powering all of your devices
think of marble as your new supercharger
it gives you all the functionality of
having your devices nearby and connected
as though they were still plugged
straight into your computer and just
like the new math book marble is easy to
take with you no need to bring your Mac
adapter with you on the road
bring marble and you'll be able to power
your devices and your computer while
you're on the go
you
this is digital storage not the digital
storage you're used to this little guy
sits inside your macbook doubling your
onboard storage
this is TARDIS 256 engineered to make
your macbook 256 gigabytes bigger on the
inside this is the future of macbook
storage TARDIS makes space for all of
your photos music documents movies and
memories and captures it all in a safe
place when your macbook fills up you
don't have to choose memories to delete
the genius of TARDIS is its simplicity
all you have to do is insert and TARDIS
does the rest
not only as TARDIS the easiest way to
double your onboard storage but for many
Mac books it's the only option
yes
whoa
yes
Oh
I love my math book it's light and the
battery lasts all day but the SSD fills
up rather quickly and I constantly
struggle to move and delete my files it
can always add an SD card or use an
external USB thumbdrive but when you are
ready to go the SD card or USB Drive
can't be left in the MacBook without
risk of damaging its really annoying
now you can add up to 384 gigabytes of
additional storage cheaply and leave
them in your MacBook or easily remove it
if you need to each Micro SSD take
microSD cards up to 128 gigabytes in
size with one SD card slot and two USB
ports on most Mac books you can
instantly add up to 384 gigabytes of
additional storage and when you are
ready to go the cards stay inside your
macbook and go with you
you
you've got the hottest new computer but
now you can't plug in any of your stuff
your new MacBook shouldn't make the rest
of your hardware obsolete and some
things just can't be connected via the
cloud introducing hub plus connect all
your devices to the new macbook hub
class is compact and durable so you can
take it with you
you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
