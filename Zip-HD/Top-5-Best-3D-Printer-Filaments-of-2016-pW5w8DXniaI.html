that makes it easy for you to 3d print
circuits buttons power connectors
voltage dividers and more right inside
your plastic prints functionalize F
electric is the most conductive 3d
printing filament you can buy it's over
a thousand times more conductive than
any filament available today
and it works on the most popular 3d
printers functionalize F electric is the
only filament that lets you print
flashlights battery packs or power
connectors right into your project
imagine a world where you can print your
next cellphone an internet-enabled thing
or the latest in wearable electronics
right on your 3d printer it'll take us a
few years to get there but that's where
we're going and functionalize F electric
is a major step forward
introducing proto cycler the world's
first fully integrated fully automated
safety certified filament recycler proto
cycler allows you to create custom
filament and any color you like anytime
from raw plastic pellets these pellets
are available in a variety of materials
and at a drastically lower costs than
filament a one-kilo spool of filament
costs you up to 50 dollars with proto
cycler you can create that same 1 kilo
spool in any color for as little as $5
that's a 90% cost savings on every
school you print with it's fully
automatic operation combined with real
time diameter feedback means that anyone
can get perfect filament every time
because there's a distributed spooling
system built right into proto cycler
your filament comes pre spooled and
ready to use with a class-leading
extrusion speed of 10 feet a minute it
only takes about two hours to create
each one kilo spool and given all the
expensive waste 3d printing produces
proto cycler delivers a revolutionary
solution to that problem as well proto
cyclers integrated grinder can recycle
all the plastic waste from your 3d
printing for the first time and he faild
prints obsolete prototypes and
especially rafting in support material
can now be recycled into perfectly
usable filament in any color so using
the proto cycler to create a one-kilo
spool from your waste plastic costs you
practically nothing a 90 percent savings
using pellets and a 100 percent savings
using your own waste plastic three smart
guys in the maker community invented the
proto cycler solution the desktop
extrusion device that anyone can use
designers innovators students teachers
companies makers and manufacturers
anyone anywhere
every day thousands of schools 3d
printing filaments are being put to use
bringing to life the imaginative ideas
are creative people filament is the
material used in 3d printing so filament
would be the equivalent to ink in two
different artists ability of filament is
very well it's also expensive typical
roll costs anywhere between 25 and 35
pounds we are a UK based startup looking
to change this in a big way by
introducing the world to the first truly
consumer orientated plastic filament
extruder the strudel it's a device that
allows you to produce quality filament
we on how strong role on the type of
plastic parts the raw buzzer pellets are
available at a fraction of the price
we're looking at over a course of the
use of one reel they're going to be
saving 80% by using tension the team
consists of robotics engineers product
designers electronic scientists one
market
you
the overlaying frustrated was not only
to create a product that perform is
better than anything else in the market
but also has a design that fits a
multitude of environments ranging from
workshops home offices and schools we
wanted it to be significantly more
approachable then our better design so
our design is going to be compact we
really wanted it to fit on the desk next
to your 3d printer so we wanted it to
make up as little as space as possible
stood out is the product that I would
see every workshop every home every
makerspace it truly is going to have
easi one button press interface that is
going to allow you get extra by simple
click of a button
strudel comes with a 2.4 inch
touchscreen with pre-loaded programs
these programs contain or fajitas and
motor settings needed to be able to
exclude successful plastic materials
you'll potentially be able to go to any
RGB value including any primary color
and we are really excited to see what
our users will produce
it's always been my dream to be able to
create things freely with all sorts of
different materials there has never been
a technique that allowed me to do that
until your 3d printing
the low-cost personal Street printers
has really made 3d printing accessible
to a great number of designers and
engineers but the choices of materials
for printing are extremely limited we
want to change this by providing makers
be the best and most innovative
materials for their printers tada maker
was founded in 2012 and is dedicated to
develop new and high quality materials
for desktops 3d printers after over a
years our new work we are now bringing
to you three entirely new materials for
you to print with the first material is
poly Max PLA regular PLA is extremely
brittle I think a lot of you have
experienced this already to solve this
we design an entirely new POA by
engineering the Nano structure of the
material it is over eight times tougher
than regular POA you can deform it to a
large extent without breaking it
it makes all your parts more durable
poly max POA prints under exactly the
same conditions as regular POA
it is really simple to print and has
really good printing quality the second
material is poly flax
Polly flax is designed specifically for
desktop 3d printers and optimized to
generate flexible printing objects with
very good printing quality signing with
poly flex has been a really good
opportunity because it allows you to
design around really tough constraints
like a prosthetic that needs to fit
right up against the human skin but it
also affords the ability to design fun
things like the version of our logo
next we have Hollywood Hollywood is
different from all other would mimic
printing materials which contain large
percentages of actual wood powder
Hollywood is the first food mimic
printing material that contains no
actual the wood like appearance of poly
wood comes from a spray foam structure
which is also what makes would feel like
wood you can also control how much it
looks like actual wood by simply at
adjusting the printing conditions
so here at made solid we feel that great
3d printing starts with great 3d
printing materials my name is Ryan
Martinez the CEO of made solid I joined
made solid about six months ago and I
came in and saw 3d printers for the
first time and I was immediately
impressed and I thought well this is a
way that we can really really change the
world by helping people take their
imaginations and turn them into reality
it's a problem I also saw was that there
was a real limitation what people could
create you have something in your head
and it wasn't directly translated into a
product to have a really good 3d print
you need three things you need a good
printer mechanically you need good
software and you need great materials
and we saw that everyone was focusing on
first two things let's make more
software let's make more printer to make
them cheaper make it so that everyone
can access them for their price but no
one was really focusing on researching
materials that would help me create
something that mattered to you so
with that in mind we started focusing on
materials we took our engineering and
our chemistry backgrounds and started
building stuff that we actually wanted
to see that would actually help us
create the reality that we had in our
imagination there's a reason you put
premium gasoline and a $200,000 car
you've invested quite a bit of money in
your preser and mate solid provides the
quality premium materials that will help
take that credit to the next step
