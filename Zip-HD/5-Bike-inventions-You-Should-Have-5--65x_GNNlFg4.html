that's why Senna has created the world's
first smart helmet for cycling equipped
with a fully integrated Bluetooth
communication system and HD camera stay
in touch with up to three riding
companions while recording video all the
way to the finish line
Senna's helmet connects to cycling
sensor apps on your smartphone allowing
you to hear valuable health information
while riding conveniently listen to
voice guides of help in cycling stats
through the built-in HD speakers to
seamlessly keep track of heartrate
cadence speed and power meter in
addition to fitness app you're paired
smartphone also allows you to make and
receive phone calls here GPS directions
or listen to your favourite playlist
while riding the integrated Bluetooth
communication system allows for
hands-free communication with up to
three other people allowing riders to
better work as a team through
communication and the shared experience
at a distance of up to 900 meters for
greater distances the center ride
connected smartphone app can be utilized
with a helmet as well enabling
communication over cellular data between
an even larger group of riders over an
infinite range with the built-in HD
camera you can record up to two hours of
video in either 1440p at 30 frames per
second or 1080p at 60 frames per second
because the helmet was created to
enhance your cycling experience in every
way imaginable every feature can be
easily controlled with the buttons on
the helmet for even further convenience
the handlebar remote can used to control
the helmet without lifting your hands
from the handlebars
while the Sena smartphone app allows for
quick modification of all helmet
settings and the Senate camera app which
uses Wi-Fi to give you full preview and

Road and your ride takes cycling to the

Jar bike is the easiest and quickest way
to learn how to ride a high school using
a jar by kids can learn to ride without
training wheels or stabilizers and learn
a ride in one afternoon
as far as a child learning the Rider
bike confidences is everything having a
product that it gives that stability
from the outset could really fast-track
child's development and confidence in
cycling I mean as far as I'm concerned
the the gyro bike is the paper clip of
the bicycle world I mean why is why
isn't nobody on it before it's such a
brilliant concept well any spinning disc
is a gyroscope it's just a matter of
what you do with the gyroscope to put it
to work for you when you spin a disc it
creates a force it doesn't want to move
off its axis what we do is we turn it on
its side and when this spinning disc is
tilted it actually turns the wheel so
that the child can continue riding
upright gyro bike has Engineering
happening all around the world and
specifically in Holland we have advanced
war going on with computer simulation
models to understand the art of
balancing a bicycle when a bicycle is
riding it at a low speed in this model
we can see a how stable a bicycle is we
implemented the gyro wheel into the
model the gyro wheel is doing a great
effort on on the stability of the
bicycle and there the gyro wheel can
help I can see the opportunity here not
just for children but started to think
about how this technology could help
more people
a lot of children with disability get
left behind and therefore something that
people take for granted like riding a
bike and not being a 12 year old with
stabilizers would give them so much
confidence that's the furthest well up
the first time she's ever absolutely got
on a bike and being able to ride out
yeah I think it's really fascinating
when you see the gyro bike for the first
time and that it doesn't fall over and
that's really revolutionary I haven't
seen anything like that before
it must be fantastic for a child's
confidence when they're learning how to
cycle from a customer perspective that
that speed and simplicity of of teaching
the child the cycle if that process can
happen quickly then you know the
learning becomes a small part of the
journey and the child can can then start
exploring and seeing how far they can go
sure it looks like a typical u-lock yes
you use it to lock up your bike and yes
it's as strong as any lock on the market

your bike it uses always on bluetooth LE

button
and thanks to skylights solar panel its
battery never runs out ordinarily I
wouldn't leave my bike unattended for
even an hour but sky lock isn't ordinary
it is a built-in anti-theft feature I
just logged skylock into my local Wi-Fi
network and it sends me an alert if
anything or anyone disturbs me like sky
lock uses its built-in accelerometer to
monitor all movement when you're not
around and you can adjust the
sensitivity to make sure there's an
actual threat you don't even need to tap
a button to unlock you can set it to use
your proximity to a lock or if you don't
have your phone just enter a code using
the capacitive touch mode let's stock

an accident

authorities help is on the way your bike
