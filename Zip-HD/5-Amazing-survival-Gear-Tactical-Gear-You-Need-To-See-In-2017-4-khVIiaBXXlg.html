all three are essential breaching tools
for operators who need to get through
doors quickly the dingdong combines
these three tools into one tight package
the hammer head features machined cross

this is the Schrade SC pen for a
tactical survival pen one of several
models in the Shrey tactical pen series
designed to hold up under adverse
conditions the SC pen 4'o manufactured
from CNC machine 6061-t6 aluminum can be
used to write whistle for help
start a fire and for self-defense in
emergency situations to write with a pen
unscrew the whistle cap to prevent loss
screw the cap back on the opposite end
of the pen to store the cap while the
pen is in use
blow through the cap to signal for help
the whistle works best when the cap is
removed from the Pens body to use the
fire striker
simply unscrew the striker plate from
the tip end of the pen shaft by turning
clockwise
rethread the striker plate back into the
end of the pen shaft with the striker
plate exposed once ready unscrew the
middle of the body of the pen to expose
the ferrule ride to cast sparks remove
the black protective coating on the
Ferro rod apply modest pressure and
quickly slide a striker plate down the

tactical survival pen
if you are a seasoned outdoorsman then
you already know that choosing the right
equipment is essential when putting your
pack together you will understand the
grueling demands of the wilderness and
most of all you will have a respectful
appreciation for nature and know that
sometimes your equipment can be the
difference between life and death when
the lead engineer of survival archery
systems started developing the SAS
tactical survival but he was already
aware of the need for equipment that was
properly engineered having survived a
near-death experience in which his
knowledge of the outdoors together with
some well chosen critical equipment and
literally saved his life he set about
developing a product for food
acquisition that would possibly one day
do the same for someone else having
spent a lifetime growing up in the woods
and having spent 15 years as an
automotive and petrochemical engineer he
set about developing a set of
requirements which encapsulate the eight
critical aspects of a survival bow that
you should look for in a premium product
these critical aspects led to a design
which was launched after two years of
development and testing and now the SAS
tactical survival bow is sold
technically the morning people all over
the world who understand the need for
premium equipment package Spolin
is critical to a compact design and to
overcome the need to strap your bow to
the outside of your pack it absolutely
must be 21 inches or under when in
transport mode the SAS tactical survival
bow comes in at that old critical length
of 21 inches even fits into most one-day
packs in order to get a bow that does
not stack and is still efficient you
need to have the right limb to rise a
ratio as well as the right overall in
designing a 60 inch long bow with a
carefully chosen looming terraza ratio
gave the SAS tactical survival bow is
perfect balance and a bow that does not
stack all the way past 31 inch draw for
long-term survival purposes it is
crucial that all working parts of a bow
are fully corrosion resistant and so
survival archery systems chose marine
grade materials throughout the only part
of the bow that is not fully corrosion
Ares
are the all-important eye tents are
still limb retaining bolts which were
chosen to give an extremely high factor
of safety in the field and only require
a light layer of animal fat or oil to
remain in perfect condition durability
is key for a survival boat and so during
the development the engineers employed
what is called design for infinite life
which basically means that the
theoretical design is capable of
withstanding 500 million shots at 31
inch draw going a step further some
hefty safety factors were added to
ensure a superlight bow that will last
more than a lifetime in a composite limb
with a through-hole is prone to cracking
around that hole unless it is properly
secured using a correctly talked bolt
and washer system the SAS tactical
survival bow makes use of a positive
limb retention system to ensure the
limbs remain safe and secure in the
field having a compact bow is important
but having a solution to store your
arrows is critical to your choice of a
well-rounded product the patented SAS
tactical survival bow is the only bow in
the market that allows for a storage
solution of errors inside the riser and
this comes at no additional cost to
space to reduce pack weight and ease of
use and maintenance-free and truly
ambidextrous bow that requires no
changing of parts are the last two
critical aspects of a great survival bow
the SAS detector Perceval bow is the
only truly ambidextrous survival bow on
the market and requires no tools to
maintain it or convert it from left to
right hand simply place a terrorist on
both sides of the riser and swap it
between hands if you're looking for a
premium survival bow that captures these
eight critical elements then look no
further than the SAS tactical survivable
revisions battle skin viper head
protection system is the world's first
fully integrated mission modular
protection system designed engineered
and tested to protect from blunt impact
blast fragmentation and ballistic
threats the head protection system
enables quick armor up and down and
strikes the ideal balance between
protection and lethality revisions
helmet shells utilize high-tech
composite technology the shells are
lightweight and deliver advanced
protection that exceeds military grade
testing required
it's inside the helmet shell a fully
adjustable modular suspension system and
adjustable retention system maximize
comfort and stability the modular
protection attachment system consists of
a multi-purpose front mount rail system
three position visor and ballistic
mandible guard all designed to fit a CH
style helmets the system can be worn in
any combination with each component
seamlessly integrating with the next the
front mount is a lightweight
multi-purpose nvg mount featuring a snag
free design it is the platform to armor
up in high threat situations for enhance
stability the front mount has three
attachment points that align with the
existing holes of the a CH 2 helmet rail
systems are available interlocking long
rails and standalone long rails both fit
flush with the helmets curvature and are
available in four sizes to ensure
optimal fit with the helmet interlocking
long rails interconnect seamlessly with
the front mount and can be used
simultaneously with the visor and
mandible guard standalone long rails
function independently and work with
commonly used nvg mounts head born
accessories such as a camera or light
can be quickly attached to the helmet by
sliding the device onto the rails the
three position visor provides high
impact protection while offering maximum
field of view and flawless optics the
visor easily clips into the front mount
with a simple one-handed movement its
unique pivot arm allows for three
in-service positions up for maximum
ventilation vented for cooling and
airflow and locked in the down position
for full face maximum ballistic
protection the visors small arm
mechanism has been refined for an
improved seal against the helmet and
mandible keeping out water dust and
fragments
additionally revisions advanced coatings
provide best-in-class anti fog and anti
scratch protection
the mandible guard offers protection for
the lower face and jaw it is available
in two options a ballistic mandible
guard or a wireframe mandible guard the
ballistic mandible guard provides
maximum ballistic protection across the
entire surface area the wireframe
mandible guard provides non ballistic
impact and blunt force protection the
mandible guard has been specially
designed for a full range of motion
allowing for maximum situational
awareness two buttons on either side
allow the mandible guard to be tilted
downwards at varying degrees for
improved sight compatibility night
vision device use airflow eating and
drinking pushing the mandible against
the chest provides a quick hands-free
way of returning the mandible guard back
to its original position
the mandible guard strapless design
enables rapid attachment and removal
when wearing the mandible guard certain
weapons sighting techniques may require
adjustment by rotating your weapon at a
45 degree angle and tilting your head
you can maintain a laser optic field of
view for targets up to 100 metres
