today bicycle is well regarded as a
great transportation alternative for its
eco-friendliness
l venus and affordability compared to
traditional automobiles however many
difficulties of riding a bicycle such as
riding on a hilly terrain and sweating
remain unresolved we invented Sentinel
wheel to perfect bicycles Sentinel wheel
is an all-in-one smart bicycle wheel
ready to transform a regular bicycle
into an electric bicycle within few
seconds any bicycle with Sentinel wheel
will give you all the freedom you
deserve in your daily life as you move
from places to places transform your
mundane days into a better day within a
few seconds send it a wheels innovation
and excellence make it simply
incomparable to all other types of
electric bicycles sent in a wheel
embraces an exclusive and unique dual
motor system made to endure and
outperform simply replace the used
battery to a fully charged battery to
reach far without having to charge
Sentinel wheel utilizes pedal assistance
system to give you full control over the
amount of work you put into wild riding
if you desire to not pedal at all you
can use a wireless throttle to operate
the wheel you may use exclusive
smartphone app to fully utilize Sentinel
wheel
through bluetooth connection long can
unlock sends it a wheel for security
check the wheel status such as travel
information and remaining battery track
your trip and location through GPS
detachable battery allows you to charge
without having to carry your bicycle
around at home or at work detachable
components allow us to serve you better
for maintenance let's say your wheels
motor breaks down don't worry we will
just ship you a new one plug it in and
ride again the unique tri spoke design
is the foundational source of centinall
wheels greatness it can embrace all the
concepts we want to put into the product
such as dual motor system and detachable
components with this design
technological and visual capabilities
are unlimited show us what you want from
inventing a great dual motor technology
all the way to putting the concepts into
a bicycle wheel it sure was a long
journey for us through countless trials
and errors we were able to create
today's Sentinel wheel in the end we
want Sentinel wheel to help you have a
better day as you move from places to
places until we do so by offering the
best transportation alternative we will
stay Restless with our Sentinel wheel
and was sick at the time and I was on
crutches and I saw electric bike which
was $4,000 electric bike and I said with
all my manufacturing background
experience I could really redesign this
bike in an engineer certain aspects of
this bike in a way where it could become
affordable to everyone that's how it all
begun
buycks got some throttles so you just
push down on it and you go you can write
a full electric or use the pedal assist
if you want to give yourself a little
bit more exercise you ride with pedal
assist if you want just go pure electric
you go pure electric not needing to
pedal all the time and just being able
to just zip along at 20 miles per hour
speed just a whole idea that you can
ride these long distances with pretty
effortlessly is an amazing aspect of a
bike
so you can really use it for a short
hops you know to work or to store or to
go to a coffee shop that that's the
future you know where people will be
more conscious and aware of the fact
that there's alternative to their
vehicles
Albert Einstein claims to have invented
his theory of relativity while riding
his bike
a Faraday bicycles were not surprised
life's greatest inspirations come to us
in those precious moments when were able
to let go of the pace of modern life
take a deep breath and relax when we
were challenged to design the ultimate
bicycle for modern living we ask
ourselves the question how do you
improve something that's been making
people's lives better for over a century
we're excited to tell you the answer add
an on switch introducing Faraday the
ultimate electric propelled utility
bicycle a bike that combines
state-of-the-art technology timeless
design and style the first electric
bicycle built by and for bike Levin's
the Faraday we've created a bicycle that
defies every expectation for what an e
bike or anybody can be there it is
built-in lithium batteries will take you
anywhere you want to go whether you're
in the fast lane
or taking the scenic group the motor is
controlled by a simple thumb switch and
delivers up to 15 miles of pedal assist
on a single charge
perfect for cruising around town or
flattening a hill to commute there's no
throttle the harder you work the more
help you get hold the thumb accelerator
down for an extra surge of power
guaranteed to make hills a lot smaller
wind a lot less windy and your commute a
lot more fun after a long ride the
Faraday recharges in just 45 minutes
we believe that your bike should let you
do more the Faraday's unique front rack
is large enough to carry whatever you
can fill it with it's attached directly
to the frame to make steering easy and
get dinner home safe the standardized
snap in design means accessories are
interchangeable or completely optional I
powered LED lights are built into the
frame and turn on and off automatically
in the dark
if Farraday comes in small medium and
large fitting writers of all shapes and
sizes its steel frame is handmade in the
USA
you
hi I'm Nathan javis I'm the founder and
chief scientist at Boalt motor bikes
when was the last time that you really
look forward to your commute across the
city I'm an inventor and so I set out to
solve a problem that my friends and I
faced every day and that's the getting
around the city sucks as a lifelong
motorcycle rider I wanted to create a
motorbike that I enjoyed riding but that
you didn't have to be an experienced
rider to enjoy today it's my pleasure to
introduce you to the m1 it's a smart
fully electric motorbike that's fun and
easy to ride like a bicycle you don't
need a license you don't need
registration and you don't need
insurance
you've got enough power to climb any
Hill in the city keep up with traffic
and you can park them on the sidewalk so
you're parking and traffic problems
disappear the m1 is designed for
performance and a motorcycle like
experience but you can go to places on
an m1 that you just can't get to on a
motorcycle and you can go faster and
farther than any bicycle
it's the ultimate urban transporter
the m1 is city friendly and low
maintenance but if you want to unlock
some real fun just dial in sport mode
for off-road use and just like a bicycle
the m1 is fast and efficient and it's
totally green it's a great way to reduce
your carbon footprint but what I really
like about it it's a hell of a lot of
fun to ride
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
