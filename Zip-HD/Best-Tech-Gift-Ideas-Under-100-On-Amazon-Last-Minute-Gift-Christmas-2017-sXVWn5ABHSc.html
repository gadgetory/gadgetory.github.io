has given up on innovation hey what's
this the notebook Hemingway wrote on
that's cool I guess we're from rocket
book and we make notebooks from the
future at rocket book we are already
famous for inventing the wave notebook

the microwaves we've shipped 100,000
waves to satisfied customers around the
world others may stop there but we're
maniacs obsessed the blending old

introducing the Everlast notebook from
rocket book the Everlast brings cloud
scalability to pen and paper simply
write scan and a race imagine one
thousand of your favorite notebooks in
one sleek design that fits in your
backpack and here's how it works
Everlast pages look and feel like paper
but they're actually constructed from a
polyester composite rather than would
you write on the Everlast using any pen
from the pilot FriXion line which are
available in-store and online writing on
the Everlast feels perfectly natural and
smooth and as the ink dries it forms a
complete bond to the polyester page so
it won't rub off but what makes this
formulation so unique is that each page
can be wiped completely clean with a
moist towel so it can be used over and
over and over again the ever last
notebook is also compatible with the
Rocket book app so before you wipe your
notes off the page you can blast
on line two your favorite cloud services
in a fraction of a second rocket book
machine vision scans enhances and sends
each page to the specific destination
they belong on the cloud services you
already use each Everlast notebook page
has seven symbols set up the rocket book
app to assign each symbol to a location
within Dropbox Google Docs Evernote or
many other services you could configure
your demon to send meeting notes

Dropbox or students could configure
their star symbol to send notes right to
a math folder in Google Drive so you can
make your list break out that diagram
