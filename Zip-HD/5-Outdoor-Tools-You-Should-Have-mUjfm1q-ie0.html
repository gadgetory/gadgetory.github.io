the Worx aerocart the smart new way to
lift and carry just about anything need
to move something huge just flip the
dolly flap and you've got a heavy-duty
hand truck don't strain moving heavy
potted plants just extend the reinforced
steel arms hook on the plant strap and
the aerocart makes the job easy snap on
the cylinder holder and the aerocart is
a barrel water jug and garbage can
transport what if you can barely lift
something in the first place simply roll

design it places the wheels right under
the weight of the load this gives you
unprecedented leverage it instantly
makes you up to four times stronger

all the heavy lifting ever try moving

never try to pick that up but watch as
the same person lists the same 200
pounds now in the aerocart

pick this up with no problem

wheel so they're unbalanced and easily
tip over aerocart has to wind so it's

when you need them that'll never happen
with aerocart are never flat tires are
always ready when you are and they're
made for outdoor or indoor use

cart ever invented you'll use the
aerocart year-round and it'll always
lighten every load so white clutter up
your garage with so many machines with
its compact design the aerocart stores
in as little space as a pair of boots
remove the handles and the aerocart
slides into the trunk of your car so you
have lifting power on the go
I love the maneuverability I love the
big tires I love the leverage that you
can get with it and it takes up a party
any space in the garage
the Worx aerocart is super versatile
just put the switch and you have at
least eight machines in one
