wouldn't think of entering to the
untamed world without its small compact
easy to use and multifunctional it can
be taken anywhere knowing what this
ultra portable tool kit provides creates
peace of mind
remember the MS 5 is the easiest
survival toolkit to carry and one you'll
never want to leave behind
the motion rate ms5 lets you blend in
with nature and take advantage of all
its beauty it comes with a world class
water purifier explore the entire jungle
without losing your sense of direction
with the rugged military-style compass
that efficiently puts you right on track
survival requires the right set of tools
and skills
with its easy-fit blades magnesium fire
starter boiling grill and flashlight the
ms5 has you covered
precision and perfection are easily
blended using premium materials we have
forged life-saving tools creating a
strong yet stylish product we go above
and beyond the contemporary to integrate
more usefulness in every product the ms5
has what you need to survive a USB
charger SOS GPS tracker a micro burner
fishing tackle plus many more essentials
over the years I've tested and reviewed
hundreds of knives but I never found
that one night I could do everything I
wanted so on early 2014 I started
sketching integrating elements from
blades I loved along with features that
had never been seen before in one knife
like a micro survival kit in a handle a
two-in-one switchable nylon Kydex sheath
that's packed with features and a rugged
knife built for tough jobs with the
finesse of a fine carving tool it's
called the MS k1 multi scenario knife to
build a knife like this I knew I needed
help so I teamed up with knife legend
Jeff Freeman the award-winning designer
of many iconic Gerber knives like the oh
six Auto the LMF 2 survival knife we
tossed around some ideas and you know he
sent me some sketches for things that he
wanted you know and we just developed it
from there we said okay well let's let's
make a product together and so he was
able to tell me the things as a product
designer did this product should do and
I was able to come up with solutions
present them to him and he could test
him in a real-world scenario
every msk one is fashioned from a single
piece of quarter-inch full-tang steel
that runs from piercing tip to rock
crushing but making it one of the
thickest most durable blades you can buy
for the msk one we chose american-made
black oxide coated d2 semi's stainless
high carbon steel because it's
ridiculously tough extremely wear
resistant holds a razor-sharp edge the
center-aligned clip point is exceptional
for piercing detailed tip carving a
precision drilling when I conceptualize
the msk one one of my major goals was to
create a knife combine the power of a
full-sized chopper with a finesse and
fine cutting ability found mostly in
smaller blades we accomplished this by
raising the blade spine which
effectively shifts the center of gravity
forward just enough to make the msk one
an incredible chopper while the jump
thumb ramp increases knife control and
directs thumb pressure toward the edge
making every cut precise and efficient
for more intricate cutting and carving
tasks the oversize toil allows you to
safely grip the knife fraction of an
inch from the blade for incredible
control for handling comfort and grip
Jeff started with advanced economic
modeling software to ensure that the MS
k1 handle was shaped to perfectly fit
the human hand
we chose canvas micarta handle slabs
because of their durability natural feel
shock absorption and comfort and cold
and wet environments front and rear
guards keep your hand in place while
cutting chopping pounding smashing or
breaking things using the MS k1 stout
butt end pummel mark was this fire
symbol our curved bubble and fire steel
striker gives you maximum leverage and
the ability to generate an aim more
sparks at your tinder than a straight
edge for quicker more efficient fire
starting for primitive fire generation
we've developed the first ever Center
balance stainless-steel bow drill divot
it transforms your knife into a solid
low resistance hand socket that's
reversible for right and left-handed
users with the handle slabs removed
three strategically placed lanyard holes
make it easy to add your favorite
paracord wrap or lash the msk 1/2 a
branch to make a spear I remember when I
was a kid and I got my first survival
knife with a hollow handle and a
survival kit inside I felt like Rambo
even though the knife was terrible in
the survival kit was mostly a gimmick so
my goal was to develop the first truly
useful handle survival kit including
hard to improvised items that could
actually help you stay alive in a
survival situation to do this I worked
with the team it was new survival gear
to develop a micro survival kit for the
msk one that includes items for fire
starting water collection and
purification fishing traps and snares
navigation repairing gear and first aid
introducing the fire beaner
understanding that fire creation is
crucial in times of emergency we've
introduced our ever spark technology to
the beaner sometimes all you need is a
spark to totally change the situation
designed to be titanium coated stainless
steel and at one ounce this should be
part of everyone's everyday carry
we integrated a blade for those ad hoc
moments paracord fishing line perhaps a
seatbelt
and of course a bottle opener for those
moments of celebration
the world is getting smaller and more of
us are traveling to distant and remote
places when we travel one of our biggest
challenges is how to guarantee that the
water we are drinking is safe there are
currently dozens of personal water
filters and filter bottles on the market
that claim to solve this issue the
problem is that water filters only trap
bacteria insists that then remain in the
filter and continue to live and multiply
this can add up to a major health
concern in addition water filters do not
eliminate or even trap waterborne
viruses that are really the biggest
concern of all to be truly protected
from bacteria and viruses water must be
purified not just filter meat pure to go
the most advanced unique and
multifunctional true water purifier in
the world period ago kills bacteria and
viruses instantly on contact and on
demand while also completely eliminating
waterborne cysts such as crypto and
Giardia there is absolutely no waiting
time or preparation required as
contaminated water passes through peer
to go it is purified instantly without
the holding timer procedures other true
water purifiers require
here to go can be used by one person or
multiple users with cleanable and
replaceable insert cartridges and can be
used over and over again for many years
and more importantly it can be stored
for long periods without the same danger
posed by filters
