3d until you own a 3d printer what you
don't realize is that removing supports
and getting rid of printing errors
really sucks we figured that if heat
created a 3d print then heat was the
best way to clean it up
the world's first heated tool for
cleaning up 3d prints with variable heat
control and interchangeable heads
designed for specific 3d retouching
tasks
when designing burritos 3d we knew we
want to make a product that was easy to
handle aesthetically pleasing something
that complements into your 3d workspace
our final economic handheld design
combines comfort decision allowing users
to hold the tour with different hands
issues with finishing 3d printed
products
you spend hours modeling your 3d designs
and yet many 3d printers leave your
prints looking scrappy and unfinished
one of the biggest frustrations is the
hours spent cleaning up your 3d prints
to create a perfect model well those
days are over
introducing the retouched 3d retouched
3d is the world's first speciality
heated tool designed to clean up 3d
printed models hi I'm Phil Newman
co-founder of retouch 3d until you own a
3d printer what you don't realize is
that removing supports and getting rid
of printing errors really sucks we
figured that it heats crater the 3d
Prince then heaps the best way to clean
it up
so after experimenting with soldering
irons heated wax tools blow torches
powered grinders and other scary
equipment we arrived at the retouch 3d
the world's first heated tool for
cleaning up 3d prints with variable heat
control and interchangeable heads
designed for specific 3d retouching
tasks it's time to finish the job
properly retouch 3d makes cleaning up 3d
prints fun and easy simply power on the
tool input your selected temperature
level and in no time
get ready to remove all the unwanted
material from your 3d printer like a hot
knife through butter
ah on Joseph's friend and I'm the
product designer retouch 3d when
designing retouch 3d we need we want to
make a product that was easy to handle
aesthetically pleasing and something
that complimented your 3d workspace our
final economic handheld design combines
comfort position allowing users to hold
the tool in different hand positions and
finishing 3d printed models with the
assistance of heat our product is truly
the first in the 3d printing industry
retouch 3ds v interchangeable macro and
micro remover heads make it easy to
remove large support structures as well
as posts and supports that are hard to
reach the 5 retouch 3d heads have been
designed to address the main issues
associated with 3d printed models from
support removal to refine a layer
imperfection
hi I'm Peter and one of the cofounders
of flex 3d the Flex 3d build plate was
designed to solve many of the problems
with standard 3d printing we designed
the Flex rebuild plate so it bent so the
parts come off super easy and you never
cut yourself with a blade you won't hurt
your fingers it's much safer than any
other 3d printing plate currently on the
market we also design a plate set as a
texture so your prints will always stick
will never by blue tape again a promise
lastly we also created a rapid change
system so it's speed your workflow up so
you can easily and rapidly change the
plates out and your prints to start a
new job in fact I printed all of this
here in one week last year we launched a
successful Kickstarter campaign to make
3d printing easier we have shipped more
than 400 plates to all 50 states and
over 37 countries these build plates
have a proven success record and now a
word from our the co-founder Victor Jean
Ville coming from Stockholm Sweden hey
Victor
well Stockholm hey Kickstarter I'm
victim Dom the co-creator of extra day
thanks to did is man over
impact-resistant thermostat that's built
to last we have used ours for over a
year and this keeps on going how about
it yes 9 of mini effects or outer
composites our community of over 400
uses around the world have tried all
complexity just works are using it
needed back
that's not only either it still set it
over a hundred Fahrenheit
our power cord so well so middle schools
high schools and universities across the
u.s. are using it to make 3d printing
easier and safer and now we're back with
many more options and sizes including
plates for the Delta printer the
flashforge and new universal size is
based on our research we also are
offering our most popular sizes again
all of these come with two plates and a
frame and we are introducing flex 3d
simple which is just a single build
plate that attaches to your printer with
provided binder clips it is the easiest
way to get the Flex 3d experience and is
available in all sizes this is
Astra print makes your 3d printer
wireless and intelligently slices and
organizes your designs in the cloud hi
I'm drew Taylor co-creator of Astro
print we've seen 3d printers make
amazing advancements over the last few
years however it drove us crazy that
printers still had cords bound to
computers LED displays from an 80 sci-fi
movie and highly complex software
interfaces we felt like we could make
the 3d printing experience better for
everyone so we spent the last year
developing the Astro print platform
Astro print turns any smartphone or
tablet into a beautiful and effective
printer interface in addition we built
it to reduce failed prints with slicing
settings that get smarter over time
here's how it works just plug your
printers USB cable into the Astro box
connect to the box via Wi-Fi and start
printing wirelessly we made a completely
plug and play for more functionality
your Astro box can slice and manage all
of your 3d printable files as well as
control your printer through our cloud
service at Astro print comm which by the
way is completely free for Kickstarter
backers we have over 40 years combined
experience in software development and
better software and interface design in
addition we're in beta spring and make a
related tech accelerator with top-level
mentorship accountability and most
importantly a kegerator Kickstarter
backers will receive our first stable
release of the Astro box and a lifetime
pro plan for Astro print comm services
currently the Astro box and Astro print
comm are ready to move into private beta
however before we release Astro print to
the public we want to add in some
important features such as camera
support remote access and a robust
printer in filament database
what do we expect from a 3d printed
object a plastic part a little rough
around the edges but what if you could
easily eliminate the layers and smooth
the surface of your printed part
achieving a high-gloss finish without a
moment above others poly smooth is
soluble in isopropyl alcohol when a poly
smooth model is placed into the polisher
an ultrasonic nebulizer creates a fine
mist in the chamber each particle of
mist is typically 5 to 10 microns in
diameter so a very even coat of IPA is
applied to every nook and cranny of your
model the particles then start melting
the surface of the model smoothing the
layers and your model is transformed in
a matter of minute
holy smooth is easy to work with and
prints very well you can get fine
details with good interlayer adhesion
holy smooth support is also very easy to
remove and once polished there is no
scar left on the surface we've built in
some really cool lighting effects into
the polisher
there's dimmable white chamber lights
that illuminate your model there's also
a multicolored never laser light which
can cycle through 15 colors or you can
set it to your preferred illumination a
sleek design of the polisher allows it
to fit harmoniously in any environment
place your polisher next to your printer
for professional own desktop fabrication
or use it to achieve those finishing
touches in a university project our goal
is to make 3d printing more functional
and accessible for everyone by
constantly pushing the boundaries of
extrusion based technology we can drive
this industry forward for the first time
you can print without layers creating a
truly finished part that can rival the
surface finish of mass production in
minutes estimating whether you have
enough filament left on a spool to
finish a print has always been a
difficult task
more often than not we find ourselves
with an incomplete print our team at
dyes design has developed a solution for
this problem
meet the filament Sentinel it's designed
to temporarily pause your print when it
detects that you've run out of filament
you can then calmly replace your spool
after multiple prototypes and design
iterations we feel ready to launch the
filament Sentinel into production your
banking will help us ramp up production
of the filament Sentinel
we can't wait to launch this project
with you our team would like to thank
you for helping us through this
crowdfunding campaign</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
