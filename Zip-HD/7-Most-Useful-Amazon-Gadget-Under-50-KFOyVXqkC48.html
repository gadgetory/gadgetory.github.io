of us mosquitoes and other flying
insects are a nuisance disrupting
neighborhood barbecues family playtime
and relaxing evenings on the patio but
they also carry and spread a variety of
diseases and infections if you've been
looking for a better way to fight
mosquitoes and other flying insects look
no further
introducing dynatrap an effective clean
and easy way to combat flying insects in
and around your home without chemicals
without sprays
without sanding with the flip of a
switch dynatrap provides you with 24/7
protection thanks to our proven 3-way
method for attracting trapping and
killing mosquitoes all mosquitoes feed
on nectar and decaying matter but
females also seek human blood which is
needed to reproduce to locate their next
meal
mosquitoes use their keen ability to
detect carbon dioxide the gas we exhale
and they can sense it from up to 200
feet mosquitoes lay their eggs even or
near a water source and eggs hatch when
the temperature reaches 45 degrees
Fahrenheit therefore it is vital to
eliminate standing water breeding sites
such as rain gutters planters buckets
and tires from around your home because
mosquitoes can produce up to 300 eggs at
a time and up to 3,000 offspring in
their three-month lifespan it is
critical to meet this problem at its
source dynatrap not only attacks the
existing mosquito population which
develop eight to adulthood in less than
two weeks it successfully targets the
female of
to prevent future generations from
invading your property and unlike other
mosquito traps which require placement
at or near the breeding site dynatrap
can be placed anywhere within the
entrapment area including areas of human
traffic but dynatrap does much more than
just trap mosquitoes it also traps a
wide variety of flying insects including
fighting flies asian beetles wasps
hornets Yellowjackets moths gypsy moths
stink bugs and more like mosquitoes
biting flies locate human and animal
hosts to feed on by sensing carbon
dioxide moisture from our breath warmth
and perspiration besides creating a
nuisance and irritating bites flies
carry and transmit debilitating diseases
affecting millions of people worldwide
moths in the caterpillar stage of
development can eat and destroy trees
plants and vegetables in your garden

weeks with continuous 24/7 operation you
will have successfully broken the
mosquito lifecycle
warmth UV light and carbon dioxide
emitted from the dynatrap mimics our
breath creating an irresistible
attraction when insects approach Dyna
traps quiet powerful vacuum fan pulls
them into the retaining cage where they
dehydrate and die let dynatrap run
continuously day and night throughout
the season to take care of existing
pests and break their lifecycle safe
silent and simple to use fresh air is a
beautiful thing and when it's perfect we
notice but we spend 90% of our time
indoors where air can be five times more
polluted it's not just pollen pet dander
and dust but it's microscopic pollutants
like mold gaseous chemicals bacteria and
viruses that cause us the most harm
these pollutants get trapped indoors
where they accumulate concentrate and
multiply current air filters try to
catch pollutants but can't eliminate
them it's time for a new approach
introducing molecule the world's first
molecular air purifier
molecule doesn't capture pollutants it
destroys them as air passes through
molecule light excites a nano coated
filter where pollutants are
deconstructed at a molecular level
