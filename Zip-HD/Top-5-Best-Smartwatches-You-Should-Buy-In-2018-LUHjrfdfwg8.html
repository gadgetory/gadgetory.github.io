telling times I use my morning rise to
clear my mind and crystallize my
thoughts when it comes to watch design
they say stay with an instructor don't
go out there if the unknown to innovate
you must push yourself beyond belief to
get to the other side and when you do
it's amazing
my name is Chad I'm the co-founder of
list - it's logic like you the watch
lover were only hungry for something
different something that stands out not
just another round watch introducing the
rebel and the name says it all we wanted
an exceptional look made from better
parts at a fair price the case is
machined out of a single piece of 316l
stainless steel and has some amazing
edges it's curved circumference and
features a genuine sapphire crystal
front and back like older watches the
eye-popping multi layers I'll bring
climbed to life in the tradition of fine
Swiss watchmaking the fifth finish and
construction are simply superb standing
behind our timepieces is keep all of our
watches are fully backed by a five-year
international warranty every rebel will
be individually numbered at a limited
vision which means that once we sell
that model it will be gone forever
we're also redefining the word brand
live is about having that direct and
personal connection with our fan besides
why should you be forced to pay three
times the actual market price just to go
to some middleman we need your backing
to bring the rebel to life and in turn
you will receive one or more than one of
these truly innovative watching
when starting to visualize oxygen we
have many ideas and requirements that we
wanted to implement we wanted to have an
operating system that is specifically
developed so wearable we wanted to make
it open source and fully customizable
and we wanted to only use high quality
material still make oxy affordable we
implemented all of them oxy is made of
316l stainless steel to make it super
durable and it's equipped with a high
resolution color rich a molded display
that is covered by thick Corning Gorilla
Glass we also found the perfect battery
solution to go with our vision of oxy
oxy can be charged using the included
magnetic charger or with our specially
designed oxy doc
you can connect oxy via bluetooth or
Wi-Fi and Parra's with any device
running Android iOS or Windows 10 but
how did we develop the perfect operating
system for wearables the first step was
to look at all available operating
systems and ask our community which
aspects they like and of course which
they did luckily we received a huge
amount of feedback and came up with the
x3 navigation system this system makes
it possible that you can access all of
oxi functions within a maximum of three
steps
oxi comes with a powerful specifically
dedicated graphics chip that makes it
possible to easily customize the look of
oxy just swipe to switch between watch
faces the different designs will be
available for free on our marketplace
along with custom applications and
widgets but oxy is not just customizable
on the inside because it's equipped with
a standard 20 millimeter love you can
use any regular wristband with your oxy
you can order a selection of custom
wristbands per month but it is
compatible with most other available
models as well with oxy we want to offer
the first SmartWatch
truly become your daily companion
the next-generation multi-touch screen
with proximity sensing a quick swipe
unlocks the watch and takes you to the
dial screen where you can make outgoing
calls manually or by selecting from the
contacts already stored in your phone
the four shortcuts take you to useful
screens all of these are easily
customizable in your hot watch app put
by default press one to see your local
weather an update on your favorite stock
and a second city time press two to see
your next meeting or alarm the number of
calories you burn today and the distance
you walked press 3 to see your text
messages and Facebook notifications
finally you can press 4 for a customized
news feed you can swipe a on the watch
face to unlock your phone and go to the
app screen here you can open any app
which is not selected in the shortcuts
like music control calculator stopwatch
timer alarm Twitter or anything else you
like like you to unlock your phone and
go to the menu screen see takes you to
clock and alarm and s takes you directly
to the SMS message screen for text
emails Twitter and Facebook messages but
you don't have to press anything at all
for how much to let you know what's
going on for example when you receive a
call the call screen comes to life and
when someone pokes you on Facebook the
Facebook page pops right up it's just a
quick glance down without ever having to
pull out your phone which is great when
you're driving so you can keep your eyes
on the road and when your hands are 10
and 2 the speakerphone is just an arm's
length away
if you leave your phone somewhere your
hot watch will alert you and if you
can't find your phone it will help you
track it down control your phone's music
player while keeping track of the
calories you burn and if it's raining no
problem
hot lunch is water-resistant if you slip
and fall well hot watch knows you might
be in trouble and can automatically text
the emergency contact of your choice
thanks to hot watch's accelerometer with
gyroscopes you can control lots of
things with hot gestures reject a call
with a shake of the hand or answer by
raising your hand to your ear wave
bye-bye to end a call a quick tap dials
your favorite number and if you don't
want to use hot gestures you can just
use the multi-touch screen to answer
make calls and send tech just to name a
few hot watch works with all phones but
you must have an Android or iPhone to
use all of its features just download
and install the hot watch app from your
app store you can customize lots of
things right from here and when you
update your app hot watches over-the-air
firmware automatically updates queue and
for developers hot watch comes with an
sdk for custom applications
