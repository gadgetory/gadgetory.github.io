inventors we constantly use 3d printers
to create and test our ideas but every
3d printer we used fell short of our
expectations they were heavy /
complicated and unreliable
we often spent more time calibrating our
printers than printing our inventions so
we came up with a simple solution
unibody this is Tico the unibody 3d
printer most 3d printer frames are built
using separate rails unibody means the
rails are built into the chassis
creating one solid piece one solid piece
you in a body and with this simple shift
in design all the problems that came
from separate rail systems disappeared
more reliable and accurate Tico sets a
new standard for 3d printers and it
doesn't stop at unibody chico has an
internal filament tray and closed bill
chamber auto safety shutoff a large
print volume a flexible base waterless
connectivity and cloud-based software so
you can print from almost anywhere on
any internet friendly device
in the last few years there have been a
wave of great low-cost 3d printers that
are easy affordable and accessible but
they're limited to only being able to
print in one color or material so we
questioned and said how can we take this
to the next level how can we bring 3d
printing to a point where we can print
objects that are much more
representative of the ideas we're trying
to communicate so we created the palette
from elegant home projects to highly
complex prototypes complete with
electrical connectivity the palette
enables your printer to create objects
that used to be in the domain with much
more expensive machines what the palette
lets you do is turn your single color 3d
printer into a multicolor and multi
property printer at mosaic we've come up
with our own unique solution it takes in
four different types of filaments and it
actually joins them together and to end
into one single filament strand that has
perfectly calibrated lengths of each
different buildings this approach
enables controllable multicolor
functionality from a single extruder the
extruder already on your 3d printer at
first it was all about color and that
was really exciting to us but then with
this new influx of materials that hit
the market like electrically conductive
filament all of a sudden were now able
to upgrade a printer to print something
like a flashlight or embedded circuitry
and that's just now there are new film
it's becoming available all the time
from magnetic to stainless steel infused
and by combining these filaments the
pallet a whole new range of functional
parts can be printed one of the big
things we focus on since day one was no
modifications as well as cross-platform
compatibility you put the pallet next to
your printer run the filament through
the measurement system feed it into your
printer and then hit print the software
that you already use the CAD programs
they can all export multiple SDL's you
slice these with your favorite slicer
run the output through our app and
you're ready to print
I realized that most of the 3d printers
in the market therefore in the two
groups our high resolution but very
expensive or affordable but in poor
quality that's why we decided moonray to
bridge the gap between quality and price
I think the best design is the one that
is out of the way and when we design
moonray we decided that we should take
all the clutter and all the things that
make a product or less less
understandable and minimize it to
something that is more useful most of
the three printers have a consumable
resin tank but we took on this great
challenge of redesigning it in a way
that you don't have to replace it after
every event that makes so it's more
durable and it lasts longer the heart of
every high resolution 3d printer is the
resin curing unit most 3d printers use
either laser or commercial projectors to
do this but we develop our own
custom-built the UV DLP projector we
call it ray one it lasts for 50,000
hours and it's able to create parts as
fine as 100 micron resolution it will
makes moonray special and attractive I
think it's the resolution I haven't seen
that type of resolution on a desktop SLR
printer it's available for the price
that it's at as well there's always been
a few different challenges in 3d prints
one is not only being able to have it
smooth from the print or a lot of
post-processing and the moon ray allows
me to be able to have
minimal post-processing and then also
the support structure usually creates a
lot of different points on a 3d print
that have to be cleaned up later and in
this case it was very easy to do
in many ways the design of the moonray
was about making it more compact and
more efficient and more versatile so it
would fit in different environments yeah
for the resolution you can't be through
a price and resolution ratio is
incredible it can't be that there's
nothing else out there like it had a
couple of characters that I created in
ZBrush printed on the moon ray and I was
really impressed I was really blown away
actually all the small details little
elements textures lines everything that
I created in the software came out in
the character and you know that really
got me excited I'm the moon ray
revolutionizes the opportunities that I
have to run my business everybody can
use one range because it's affordable
it's easy to use and it has the best
resolution we believe that the future of
3d printing relies on making it
available for everyone we are excited to
deliver moon ray to everybody and to see
what they can create with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
