fiction is very quickly becoming
possible if you point the structure
sensor out into the world you're
capturing the world it's like giving
some sort of a superpower to average
Joda but what if you could give your
mobile device a new sense the ability to
not just capture the world in
two-dimensional images but to actually
understand it in three dimensions the
structure sensor does just that
it's the world's first 3d sensor for
mobile devices what I really am excited
about the destructor sensor is it makes
it so easy you can clip it to a mobile
device and walk around your world
basically pull your world into a digital
form my name is Jeff powers and I'm a
founder of occipital we're passionate
about giving devices the ability to see
and understand the world around them
this isn't about taking pictures it's
about computer vision and interaction we
call it spatial computing it's much
bigger than just us and it's going to
change the way we interact with the
world let me show you what you can do
with this you'll be able to capture
every dimension of an entire room in a
matter of seconds and you can send a
model to your phone so you can get any
dimension you need at any time you'll be
able to easily capture and send
three-dimensional objects across town or
across the world and make decisions
together even when you're apart you'll
be able to play games games where the
real world becomes the game world

everyone uses pen and paper they will
never be replaced
however more and more people are
embracing their iPads and tablets to
take notes and capture ideas in a new
hybrid analog digital workflow these
users continuously switch between paper
and tablet during the day this means
they require both the traditional ink
pen and a touchscreen stylus while both
are great on their own we would prefer
to have our everyday pen be compatible
with iPads and tablets with a click of a
button eliminating the need to carry
both items this was the inspiration for
the lunatik touch pen
we've applied the same obsessive design
philosophy of our tick-tock and lunatic
watches to our pen of choice the
japanese-style precision rollerball the
lunatik metal touch band is manufactured
from aircraft grade aluminum and
features a patent-pending dual mode tip
that allows you to seamlessly use it
with any touchscreen as with all lunatik
products the design eases premium
materials simply unscrew the pen to
access the ink cartridge the pens use
limited precision ceramic rollerball
refills and will ship with a point seven
millimeter cartridge going from paper to
screen is as natural and simple as
clicking your pen like you always have
and once you have transitioned to the
digital side you have endless ways to
express yourself with the same pen
through a wide range of note-taking and
creative apps
let's face it touchscreens are here to
stay and we believe that stylus use will
become more common for certain types of
precise input that fingers are not
designed for
laptops and products and Android devices
are everywhere in our daily life
however the incompatible parts of these
devices can occur serious frustrations
like Monica had before the idea of this
whole new design is chaffed flash state
control both regular USB microUSB and a
Latin impulse which will make it
possible to save read and a chance for
dieter between devices with different
aparts with hard work and a great
dedications from a bro TAC team here we
are proudly introducing the world where
original unique all world's first mini
sri ram flash drive
Unicom is an Orion wham flash drive
which is compatible to USB lightning and
a macro USB ports you don't need more
than when flash drive or connecting to a
meter computer to you Nicole does it all
for you
your life will become much easier by
just having a unicorn unicorn more than
just convenience
smartphones and tablets can do so much
but how useful is a device without a
charge hi I'm Cameron and I'm David we
spent the last year researching and
analyzing how people interact with their
devices the results were surprising
power is not the problem we are
constantly near power the problem is
we're just not making the connections so
we asked why the answer is simple
plugging in devices is a pain cords fall
on the floor or even disappear so we
created the ever doc and the ever doc
duo - beautiful Docs that will enhance
your home or office and create a perfect
sanctuary for your phone or tablet to
charge and remain in reach the result
was a doc that looks beautiful whether
in the office on the nightstand in the
kitchen the bathroom or even on an end
table in the living room the ever doc is
the first and only dock that is designed
to work with all smartphones and tablets
the duo is the only solution that can
attractively charge more than one device
at a time perhaps yours is a house
divided with the ever Doc this is not a
problem the ever doc easily accommodates
Apple's lightning connector 30 pin
connector or microUSB no screws required
the ever doc works with or without a
case using micro suction technology the
ever doc stays anchored to any surface
while allowing easy to finger removal
this is especially convenient when you
have your hands full machine from a
solid block of aircraft-grade aluminum
the ever dock is beep blasted and
anodized to create a beautiful body that
matches today's premium electronic
devices we've enjoyed using the ever doc
and never worrying about our batteries
we know you'll feel the same way and we
can't wait to share it with you in order</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
