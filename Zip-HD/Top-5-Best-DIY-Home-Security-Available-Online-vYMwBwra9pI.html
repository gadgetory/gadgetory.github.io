device that's actually smart it knows
the difference between your dog your dog
walker and any unexpected dog walkers
ask lighthouse to let you know what time
your kids get home from school to let
you know if they're running late or if
Sarah comes home with a brad lighthouse
will recognize that she has a guest with
her and mom's notification gives her a
chance to welcome him herself lighthouse
also recognizes certain gestures like
waving so Luke can get dad's attention
while he's out of town that's really
cool and if mom comes home to discover
something out of place all she has to do
is ask did the dog jump on the couch
today maybe the better question is who
is running between 3:00 to 5:00 p.m. and
that's why we created lighthouse simply
put lighthouse is the first of its kind
it uses a 3d time-of-flight sensor and
the most advanced computer vision and
machine learning ever put into a home
device with this kind of smarts you can
keep your home and family safe while
engaging with your loved ones in a
totally new way
because it's about time a smart home
device actually knew the difference
between this this and this welcome home

keep on working for up to a year without
needing to be recharged with the
adjustable ball shape mountain ever cam
can be positioned and repositioned use
either the single screw mounting base or
skip the mounting hardware the magnetic
1080p HD camera will just stick to all

withstands temperature changes and
moisture so you really can put it just
about anywhere motion triggered and
Wi-Fi connected ever cam sends you a
notification when someone's at the door
or someone's on the sofa even when
someone is raiding the fridge the
artificial intelligence uses a
three-phase system to ensure you see
what you want to see and ignore what you
don't step one it's able to screen out
movement that doesn't have a heat
signature using an infrared sensor step
two it detects human body shapes in
various positions and step three facial
recognition technology allows ever cam
to recognize faces of people you want to
give clearance to or keep a closer eye
