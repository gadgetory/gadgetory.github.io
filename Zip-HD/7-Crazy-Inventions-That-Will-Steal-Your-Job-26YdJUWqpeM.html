making real objects out of real
materials we call it a 3d carpet
everyone has a killer idea we've all
seen things and thought I can make this
better or higher quality or I could just
make it myself we want you to be able to
make it that's always created carbon we
want you to be able to go ideas and its
products and under five minutes so we
broke it down and three easy steps first
make your design design software can be
hard to use so we made use them easy to
use and it runs in your browser the next
step is to choose your material wood
plastic soft metals like aluminum even
circuit board pick whatever inspires the
last step is no matter what kind of
maker you are you click car and take
being able to design in a program and
have that same program connect to the
machine just beyond amazing the steps
involved has been cut down to mere
nothing now the idea it isn't focused we
wanted to be as beautiful as it is
functional to reach out to Scott Wilson
and CMAs designers at minimal people
need to be able to jump in and use it
and quick thinking about the tool so
much and think about what they're trying
to do today we finally have a prototype
that we love it's beautiful
it's apply it to clean and it's just
neatly on a desktop but most importantly
work great
introducing orbit one orbit one is a
user-friendly tabletop electroplate er
that turns your ideas into gold let your
creative spirit guides will to make
innovative art and useful objects make
this a jeweler experiment with various
materials coding time and thicknesses
explore a whole new world of endless
possibilities this technology helping
you show off your personality and style
in new ways the only limitation is your
imagination orbits mobile app monitors
the coding process and serves as a
real-time reminder with orbit 1 you can
also make PCB and circuit and so much
more action figures can be further
enhanced and strengthened
before the one use the only one app to
control orbit 1 to give your belonging a
fine finish and just really simple steps
first polish your object second spray
the conductive spread and last just
click start it comes with different rest
so you can coat almost any material at
any size that you wish
Doombot m1 is an industrial level
robotic arm production platform it's
precise fast and extendable and also
affordable it can be your 3d printer
laser engraver soldering machine or
whatever else you build upon it yes you
can build one do bottom one has 0.02
millimeters repeatability and 1.5
kilogram Talos with these standardized
easy to change heads you can easily turn
this power into productivity like 3d
printing it can print your product with
fluency and detail to colors no problem
or use laser to engrave your unfading
masterpiece or do sophisticated
soldering customizing your PCB circuit
board better than a pro besides being
multifunctional do bottom one is also
easy to master and develop doo-bot m1
supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connection
you can connect to multiple arms at once
and control them via our app on PC or
smartphone with a force sensitive 3d
mouse you can control do bot m1 as
precisely as you want no more trying and
guessing on a confusing software with
its hand whole teaching feature you can
input coordinates in the fastest and
most intuitive way
do bottom one is programmable via the
integrated API you can use official or
self built developing environment or use
this visualized programming interface
making things a lot easier but we don't
stop here do bottom one is highly
extendable there are no limits to your
imagination on it the maximum reach of
do bottom one is 400 millimeters which
is enough for most of the situations but
why don't we think bigger when it can
actually go further or use a camera for
visual with it's fast and accurate image
recognizing algorithm it can distinguish
colors without making one mistake do
about em one loves companion they can
work seamlessly together processing
paperwork way faster than humans could
ultimately do bottom one is built to
replace manpower in production line
working day and night non-stop the
built-in mapping and path planning
system provides this excellent mobility
providing inventory management service
in your warehouse to be able to create
so much value to bottom one has been
built with extraordinary performance the
perfect calibration of the high
performance DC servomotor harmonic
reducer and kinematic algorithm has
brought out the best with both strength
and speed repeatability of 0.02
millimeters
maximum payload of up to 1.5 kilograms
angular speed of up to 200 degrees per
second it's also a steady player never
slips up
everyone loves creating things and
having a robotic arm is awesome with do
bottom one it's no longer a giant
business's privilege to use professional
robotic arms everyone can now benefit
from a cost-effective user-friendly
robotic arm technology so when a new
idea hits you do bot m1 will be ready
motor works by combining abrasive
particles with the high-pressure water
stream the mixture exits the nozzle and
has through the workpiece it's great for
any workshop because every material it's
compact and contains and it's digital so
you can make precise cuts that are
impossible to make any other way as an
industrial designer I've used a variety
of Vespa propagation tools but they tend
to be very limited by the durability of
the materials you can use on those
machines but it sets up water jet we go
from design the component to fitting
that component and testing within couple
of hours such an incredibly powerful
tool as a jeweler and an artist with the
work I make I spend a lot of time hand
cutting so right now I'm selling pieces
sort of a almost limited edition because
I can't physically output them not
because I want to be making in a limited
edition Weezer would allow me to not
only make a lot more but also to lower
the price point so they'd be available
to a broader audience
there are many challenges running a
hardware startup one of the biggest ones
is prototyping quickly and efficiently
you have an idea of what you want to
build but until you actually build it
you don't really know what it's going to
look like you don't know what it's going
to feel like and you don't know how it's
going to function so the current
solution are you to do things manually
with a pair of tweezers and hours time
or to set things out to a third party
assemble things for you place between
days weeks and cost hundreds to
thousands we try to do everything
in-house and the reason to do that is to
speed up the development cycle you're
going to make mistakes and if you're
going to make a mistake might as well
make it in-house you know right away and
you can make another version as soon as
possible
the problem we set out to solve is to
automate prototyping and small batch
assembly to allow startups to work with
smaller parts and to do it in-house
rather than sending out to the contract
manufacturer
my name is Alan Flula and I'm the
founder of chips and we're bringing a
low cost picking place machine to market
helps electronics developers prototypes
faster today's electronics components
are getting faster and smaller than ever
but this presents some interesting
prototyping challenges namely how
difficult it is to pick up these tiny
components and put them on the circuit
board to make your first orifice do
things by and take between few minutes
for a simple circuit to six hours for
complex
she's upside down mr. Mallory
the chips that r1 is a solution that you
can use to build your boards same day
inhale figure out if your design works
and then get to market faster we knew
that a pick and place machine could be
made for the price of a highest rate
printer and it's really what we needed
as developers chipler will change the
way people prototype by allowing them
access to smaller newer lower power
cards that are more advanced and by
cutting time from vertically so I'll
pick and place machine uses a small
suction cup and pick up the components
from the reels that are supplied on and
place them where they need to go on your
circuit board the chips that are one has
all the features of an industrial
pick-and-place machine including an auto
tool changer removable feeders for both
tape type tapes and Guice components as
well as top and bottom vision ensuring
your parts replaced activity we know how
important it is have many feeders to
support your picking place machine and
that's why we've designed low-cost fears
these feeders can quickly and easily be
swapped in and out of the machine
keeping your setup time down between
jobs well I think the chips that are one
will definitely help you build
prototypes quicker which allows you to
get some market quicker as well and
ultimately we'll build a better product
for your business and affect your bottom
line typically we have to spend our PCBs
away to a fab house that fab house is
usually in Asia there could be shipping
problems that we problems with the
prototype itself and that's just
unnecessarily slow so with something
like chips that are could speed up your
development time from weeks today
prometheus
pop machine that makes real circuit
boards in just a minute if you hate
waiting week to receive your circuit
boards in the mail you can use
Prometheus to reduce that way down to
minutes prometheus can produce
extraordinary detail it's rigid and it's
precise I've been working full-time for
the past two years to bring Prometheus
elect before you can make your circuit
board you need to design it in
appropriate the free software out there
isn't very friendly towards absolute
beginners so I wrote circuit justice on
your board
click cars and a Prometheus will me
