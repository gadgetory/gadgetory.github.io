TK 800 4k projector this thing is
specially designed to be great for
watching sports ball and since its World
Cup season after all we thought why not
build the dream
big screen sports watching setup for
nerds with the tk-421 sorry excuse me
the TK 800 step one is something to
actually watch the game on trust me
inviting people to come over and listen
to the game doesn't work nobody will
show up now lots of people use home
projectors for their hundred inch plus
home theater setups where they have
complete ambient light control and
they're watching usually movies in the
dark and if that's your thing
then Ben cues HT 2550 is a great choice
but this this is a far better one when
you've got more light in the room like
when you're gaming with the kids or when
you're running a more social event where
people want to be able to eat and talk
instead of just being focused on the
content that's because the TK 800 is
rated at 3000 lumens of brightness
it's got HDR support and it's got 92%
coverage of the REC 709 color space in
part thanks to its RGB W color wheel
that extra slice of wheel lets white
light shine through for extra brightness
to overcome ambient light pollution it's
not quite as easy as it sounds though if
too much white comes through the image
can look overcooked and washed out if
you let in too little then yeah the
colors will look more natural more
vibrant but you won't get close to that
advertised 3000 lumen brightness unless
the screen is displaying a mostly white
image it's all about finding the right
balance next up if you're an
insufferably competitive type-a like me
then
need some accessories to help you gloat
now you could use team specific
celebration tools but personally I've
always found it's cheaper
not to mention less likely to get
demonetised to just throw as much
obnoxious as possible at my friends it
truly is a wonder that I have any moving
on our projector would work on a plain
white screen or failing that even a wall
but this is Linus tech tips I mean come
on so we went way over the top with a
screen that costs almost as much as the
projector itself this is a 100% ambient
light rejecting screen and it was sent
to us by our new besties at silver
ticket products now a normal white
screen will scatter all of the incoming
light which gives it diffusion
uniformity or uniform brightness across
the whole screen but that means that
even ambient light get scattered
washing out the image an angular
reflective screen like this diverts
off-axis rays of light leaving the image
crisp which reminds me
pretty much the most physical thing
about watching sports is eating as much
as you possibly can and we have got our
bases covered
see what I did there with the bases
first use Domino's is zero click app to
expend as few calories as possible their
app lets you order your usual with
delivery to whatever address is attached
to your profile then this is actually
the techy part you can use if this than
that to track your order progress like
sending you a text when your pizza's
been put in the oven or changing your
Philips hue lights once it's out for
delivery
I think that was great but all those
reminders are probably just gonna make
you hungrier so you will need some munch
a bowls to tide you over that is why I
am jerry-rigging this pet camera a
device typically used to launch treats
to your pets to be my personal M&amp;amp;M seen
it of course dispenser you guys ready
all right and go
seriously though for modern spectators
one screen is often not enough and that
is why my events are always be why ot
bring your own tablet you can use it to
chat with other fans online as the game
unfolds hang out with a friend who's
watching elsewhere or heck even watch a
different sporting event all to get
really rocket League it's a new sport
it's not a sport so a sport well yeah
how does this thing even work how much
did we pay for it I put it in the front
oh stop trying to put it in the back
line whoa and you can wash those salty
snacks down with an always cold drink
thanks to this generic and very Chinese
looking cooling pad oh my who said it
too hard so thank you to Ben Q for
sponsoring this video we had a lot of
fun making it the TK 800 is a killer
value 4k HDR projector and it's got
support for deep healing 3d if you pick
up some glasses which is not sports
related but it was something to cover
about the product and now seemed like
the opportune moment anyway you guys can
learn more about it or pick one up at
any of the links in the video
