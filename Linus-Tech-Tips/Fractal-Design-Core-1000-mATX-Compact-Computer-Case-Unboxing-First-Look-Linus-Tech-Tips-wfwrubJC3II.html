fractal design core 1000 sorry about
that I forgot my knife core 1000 micro
ATX computer case now they call it a
computer case but because I guess it's
hard to call a micro ATX case like I
gain in case or anything like that and
honestly this case is very very popular
with our b2b sales guys at NCIX where I
work so um maybe I'm just being
completely irrelevant when I bring up
gaming at all but fractal is more known
for their enthusiasts class of cases so
I'm pretty excited to have a look at
their core series because the core
series is as the name implies more of a
oh okay the documentation is their
user's manual more of a bare-bones style
case sounds quite small which is one of
the reasons it's gotten chosen for some
of the for some of the designs some of
the system builds that we've done
because it's very very compact and fits
you know fits in well in like an office
environment something like that just
because of its size I know we had one
guy hmm I needed like 20 of them because
that was this was the only case that he
could find that fit the dimensions of
the cabinets that it has that bad to fit
into other than getting like a Dell or
something and that's what he did last
time and based on his experience with
the last time he decided he wanted
something from NCIX not something from
now so there you go alright it's fairly
small pretty lightweight I wouldn't have
minded seeing slightly thicker foam
packaging but it's probably not the end
of the world because once again it is
fairly small and it is fairly
lightweight the user's manual I'm just
gonna tuck in there and let's go ahead
and get this baby opened up so
everything we look at about this case
it's important to bear in mind the price
of it this is a very very inexpensive
case on the bottom we find like
rubberized grip II things on the fore
feet which you usually actually don't
see in a case at this price point okay
let's flip it over here
so this case uses positive pressure in
order to achieve its cooling so you can
see we have a filtered front 120
millimeter fan in there we have up to
two five and a quarter inch base this
uses their same kind of meshed filtered
so the mesh that we have on here does a
couple things it's a fan filter but it
also reduces the overall noise output of
the case a little bit we've got a
fractal design logo right about Yana and
front outputs are all done on the right
hand side here so we have power to USB
2.0 headphones microphone a reset switch
that is recessed so it's difficult to
hit actually at all
but especially difficult to hit my
accident harddrive indicator as well as
a power LED now why did I say this case
uses positive air flow possibly remember
positive perhaps or positive pressure
air flow is good because what it does is
it reduces the amount of dust that can
settle in your case actually here can I
get you to move a little bit that way
because I think we're going to need this
light there so what that means is that
if you have a filtered intake that is
pushing more air into the case than
you're actually removing it means it's
very difficult for dust to get sucked
into the little gaps around the edges
and the end into unpopulated fan holes
and things like that so in the back we
have a 92 millimeter fan spacing that is
actually considered optional it does not
have a fan included with it by default
so by using just the 120 millimeter in
the front and the power supply fan you
will have positive internal pressure
which keeps the dust out if for example
you were to install only fans that suck
air out of the case and that and they
don't act and you didn't have any
filtered intake fans that would mean
that all these little holes these ones
and these ones would be sucking in
unfiltered air and allowing dust to
settle in the case so I know I've
blathered about that for an awful long
time now so don't worry we will at some
point actually open up the case if you
guys watch enough of my videos you'll
probably know this I'm a bit of a
fractal fanboy at this point I do really
like their overall design they're great
at taking sort of a
well a lowish price point for the
features they deliver and then
delivering features that are difficult
to deliver at a given price point so I'm
pretty interested to see what we find
inside here so that's a 92 mill in the
back is either an eighty or ninety two
mill and then that one we saw at the
front one 120 millimeter fan spot
like I said fairly low-end case so don't
expect you know to it to be too
overbuilt compared to something from
their defined series or their arc series
okay on the inside we find a very very
very straightforward internal layout so
you got micro ATX compatibility that
means for expansion slots as well as
your i/o shield here top mounted power
supply bottom mounted power supply is
totally unnecessary for micro ATX just
because we're not talking performance
machines that have huge huge old power
supplies that need to be isolated from
the rest of the system in terms of their
airflow so your power supply goes right
on the top and it'll also easily reach
you know your graphics card or whatever
else because it's really just not that
far away from anything okay motherboard
tray is reinforced using the bending
technique so that makes it a little bit
more stiff and that is important for a
case like this front panel connectors
are amply long so you can actually
manage those cables fairly easily and
you can reach even the furthest away
front USB ports or front HD audio ports
which on some stupid motherboards are
located like here right so you'll have
no problems with any of those things as
well now here's something that's
actually kind of neat I mean totally
unnecessary but I kind of need to check
this out so well first here let me
remove this and check this out guys so
you can actually remove with this thumb
screw right down here and these two
thumb screws up here the three and a
half inch hard drive mounting so what
that means is that you could actually
install the longest possible graphics
card in here if you really wanted to
build a tiny like tiny look how small
this cases for context right guys
tiny micro ATX gaming system you could
do it because it would be receiving
direct airflow from that 120 millimeter
fan in the front right and ah you didn't
have all the space that you need oh yeah
to do is throw a 92 millimeter cooling
fan on the side panel exhaust some of
that hot air coming off the graphics
card you're in pretty good shape so
there's your two five and a quarter inch
phase there's your hold on a second we
figured it out so doing a little bit of
research before I started my video might
have helped make this easier but check
this out that is how the hard drive
mounts so you can actually have your
long ass video card in this case I have
a GTX 590 in here installed and you can
have a three and a half inch hard drive
because the whole hard drive mounting
thing is just on this one strip so you
see these rubberized ones that's for
your two three and a half inch drives
potentially and then you see these non
rubber ones these guys right here those
are for SSDs so you can either do a
single hard drive and then an SSD or you
can do two hard drives or you can do
three SSDs so cool right and then oh
look at that there's another three and a
half inch up here as well
actually that looks like well huh yeah
that better be three and a half inch
yeah and then it looks like they're
mounting holes on here for an SSD as
well so you can install an additional
drive here so you could do two hard
drives in an SSD by doing it that way so
this is a fantastic little case in terms
of the design that allows them to cram
in hardware even tighter than I have
seen in the past not a lot of cable
routing options guys it's a very narrow
case so there's pretty much no room
between the back panel here and the
motherboard tray but you know kind of
get over it I guess for like 40 bucks
what are you expecting exactly so thank
you for checking out my unboxing and
first look and actually fairly impressed
