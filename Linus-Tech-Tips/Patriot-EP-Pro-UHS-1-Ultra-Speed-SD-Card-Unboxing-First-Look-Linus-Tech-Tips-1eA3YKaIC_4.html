actually I personally am very excited
about this is the Patriot EP pro 32 gigs
secure digital high capacity
Professional Series SD card yes it's an
SD card maybe SD cards aren't that
exciting to you maybe you don't
frequently fill up a 32 gig SD card and
then have to sit around and wait and
this in the studio late at night which
it happens to be right now while we're
waiting for footage to copy and wait for
footage to copy so as long as you have a
compatible sdhc SDXC USB 3 readers you
can take advantage of this UHS 1
standard which will allow you to have
higher cut that higher higher higher
speed data transfers up to 90 megabytes
per second read and 50 megabytes per
second right now I don't care about the
rights because even a class 10 was good
enough for all the HD equipment we have
I care about those 90 Meg per second
reads because we're maxing out around 30
with the class 10 cards that we have now
so this new standard is going to allow
us to wait one third as long for our
footage transfers when we're done
filming yay also Patriot gives you a
five year warranty and you can
apparently visit them on Facebook so
that's pretty much it this will be the
SD card that i will use from now on
because it's awesome it's faster and if
it's not faster than i won't use it but
i'll let you guys know thanks for
checking out my unboxing and don't
