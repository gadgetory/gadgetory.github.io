hearing the banshee scream a 56k
followed immediately by the forlorn
wails of whoever was in the middle of an
hour's long anime music video download
are over and the latest wireless
standards are better than ever claiming
to be as fast as running a physical wire
but is wireless ad any good
I mean ad can you believe this have you
heard about this abs in our Wi-Fi how
dare they I mean well okay hold on a
second they do pay the bills around here
so tell you what why don't you watch an
ad and see if it's that bad before you
make up your mind
cooller masters 25th anniversary edition
cosmos 2 features a unique dual curved
tempered glass side panel check it out
now at the link below let's start this
by saying that 802.11 ad is not just a
new revision of an existing standard
like AC wave 2 was you can learn more
about that one here it's actually
something new entirely you see Wi-Fi to
date has traditionally used two major
frequencies 2.4 gigahertz and 5
gigahertz what wireless ad brings to the
table is a new frequency 60 gigahertz
and along with it speeds of up to 4.6
gigabit per second and you might even
see advertised speeds of up to 7.2
gigabit per second although that isn't a
new trick from big Wi-Fi and if you read
the fine print you'll see they're just
combining the ad speeds with the other
two frequencies well gee that sounds
great - but isn't 5 gigahertz already
pretty difficult to use through walls
wouldn't 60 gigahertz be even worse yes
yes it would the higher the frequency of
the radio wave the harder it is for it
to penetrate a non-conductive solid like
a wall or a person so at a wavelength of
only 0.5 centimeters 60 gigahertz is
likely to be absorbed or reflected by
basically anything even very small
obstacles but enough high school science
it's summer and you've got better things
to do right like watching us give you
these juicy performance numbers from the
Netgear our 9000 Nighthawk x10 and
tp-link caolan80 7200 so we fired up
iperf using a script rewrote in order to
launch four simultaneous instances and
record the output into easily digestible
csv files
testing both routers and our test laptop
with 2.45 and 60 gigahertz it should be
no
it's that because this is an
investigation into 802.11 80 performance
and not a router roundup we are focusing
on single client performance starting
with 2.4 gigahertz we can see that we're
really struggling to maintain a stable
speed each of the four iperf streams is
competing with each other for bandwidth
5 gigahertz on the other hand was nice
and clean about what you'd expect from a
wired connection I'll be at a slower 160
gigahertz Oh screaming fast as
advertised but we did note quite a bit
of variation between our streams and our
Netgear test charge here perfectly
demonstrates something that wasn't
advertised that we will get to
momentarily comparing the averages both
of our routers were more or less on par
with each other in every spectrum and
moving on to our file copy tests we
found more predictable results 802.11 ad
gives a significant real-world boost in
speed over the 5 gigahertz and 2.4
gigahertz bends similar in fact to Wired
speeds cool but where we depart from the
wire is in signal integrity as part of
our testing we tried to see how far we
could go before losing out on our big
speed upgrades and for this we had to
venture into the dreaded realm of the
outside world so then to test range we
set up our Netgear Nighthawk on our
brand new picnic table fired up iperf
and started walking after an arduous
sixty three point five foot trek the 60
gigahertz signal dropped altogether rip
signal 5 gigahertz and 2.4 gigahertz
we're still going strong with connection
rates of 866 and 300 megabit per second
respectively the tp-link Alan same deal
picnic table iperf walking and just
before we keeled over from exhaustion at
90 feet while we didn't drop the signal
but we might as well have because
performance
much better on 60 gigahertz than it was
on 2.4 but I mean that's not too bad my
house is less than 60 feet across one
small problem though it has stuff in it
so let's simulate then stuff in the way
we use the Netgear router box as our
first obstruction
before we add way what are you serious
the box caused the 60 gigahertz signal
to drop out all it has in it is
cardboard and paper
as for the tp-link oh okay here we get a
better result latency increased a little
bit but otherwise it was still connected
okay then how about a computer monitor
again the Netgear dropped out and the
tp-link kept on trucking
okay how about just turning your back to
the road okay here we go
this is where both routers fail this
much sexy human border is just too much
for our poor 60 gigahertz signal
so then tp-link wins thanks to its array
of eight freaking antennas right Wow
let's take the fight back indoors in my
office neg ears obstruction avoidance
strategy of bouncing Wi-Fi signals
around allowed it to go from struggling
to penetrate a folded up tablecloth to
delivering solid performance to a client
directly behind my monitor so ad
wireless then there are some obvious
early adopter hassles like limited
availability of compatible clients and
high costs and piling on top of that
there are some less obvious hassles like
probably needing to run a cable to the
middle of your ceiling to get your
access point line-of-sight to everyone
in the room but in certain applications
we definitely see the potential here and
I am pretty stoked to see like home mesh
networking solutions based on this tech
as an alternative finally to this kind
of nonsense
but as for whether you're ready for a
wireless ad router
today well I think it's safe to say that
that's still a
in the air there's never been a better
time to join Dollar Shave Club for a
limited time new members get their first
