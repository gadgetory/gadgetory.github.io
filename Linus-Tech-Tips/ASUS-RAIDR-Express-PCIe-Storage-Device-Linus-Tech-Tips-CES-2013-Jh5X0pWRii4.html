been under wraps and under development
at asu's for 11 months already and it's
not even released yet we're looking at
probably sometime later this year 2013
you guys are going to be able to get
your hands on your very own Raider
Express welcome to Linus tech tips at
CES 2013 our trip to the show this year
is powered by Corsair maker of quality
PC components and peripherals our
trusted storage partner is Seagate
technology and our trusted networking
partner is Linksys
this is a storage solution from a soos
which officially puts them in more
categories than I think anyone else in
the entire computer component business
but they are very very serious about the
way that they're entering this category
I mean look at the way a soos did
networking where they came in you know a
couple products and then boom all of a
sudden Asus routers are all over the
place you might see the same thing here
this is a PCI Express 4x card we're not
able to talk about what kind of a
controller it's using we're not able to
talk about what kind of flash it's using
I'm not even allowed to show you the
back but what I am allowed to tell you
is that this is gonna look sweet with
your ROG board and what I'm also allowed
to tell you is that Asus has taken 11
months to release this guy not only
because they care about the performance
any ROG product performs this is a given
we already think I shouldn't even be
saying this you guys know this already
ROG project product performs but this is
all about compatibility and
interoperability it is bootable it is
fast so that's all good it'll also work
so they validated with every active Asus
chipset so it'll work on any Asus board
they're gonna just say yes by asus board
put this in it yay thumbs up if you buy
an rog board it'll look sweet but you
know we buy another board it'll still
perform awesome in fact if you buy even
a other more completely different board
from another manufacturer they're
validating that too so these are some of
the issues that people have had in the
past with these PCI Express based SSD
storage solutions mistakes made by other
companies are to the benefit of someone
like Asus because they can take that and
go look we're not going to do it that
way we're gonna fix it I for one I'm
extremely excited about this because
frankly there's not that much stuff that
you can put in a PCI Express slot I
consider myself kind of ridiculous as
far as my computer goes I've got a dual
slot graphics card dual GPU which is
enough for me I got my sound card my
ball in essence dents or his own arse
ents rather and then I've got a raid
card so this would be instead of a raid
card attached to a bunch of SSDs I could
have a raid card SSD thing going on in
that slot and other than that I mean
what else can you really put in there
capture card
I got a capture card so now we're gonna
have more options and because of that
PCI Express 4x connector we're moving
beyond the bottleneck of say two three
six gigabit per second it's not fast
enough already and in another quarter
from now when this guy sees the light of
day it's going to be even not fast
enough
so PCI Express here we go
thanks for checking out this video and
don't forget to subscribe make sure you
catch all of our CES 2013 coverage and
we're gonna amend this to the end
there's actually a couple cool overlays
so you can overlay your own crosshair
and I'm afraid I actually don't know how
to do it but probably something to do
with this game there you go
aim point for practice mode and you can
overlay a timer for yourself so if you
have me say you're an RTS player and
you're like oh yeah I got to go check
back on that expansion base in 45
seconds you got your startup order you
got it down you set up your timer that
way
you're able to check it and monitor it
without using like a phone stopwatch or
something like that
you
thanks for watching - tech tips at CES
