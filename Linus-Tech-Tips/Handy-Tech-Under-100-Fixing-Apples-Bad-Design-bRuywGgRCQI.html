to handy tech under 100 wear whether
you're a Mac or a PC or a pioneer from
200 years ago who's still alive somehow
we've got something for you and we've
also got a sponsor Volta this first one
feels totally sci-fi but then at the
same time I'm like I'm kind of surprised
that you don't just see it everywhere
this is the beam authentic and it's
basically how wearable dif this smart
button connects to a slightly confusing
companion app that lets you create
upload and share images that you can
then beam ah there you go right to your
lapel you can show a single image a Jif
or create a slideshow and you can attach
the button with the included magnets or
a good old-fashioned pin battery life
varies so it ranges from 4 to 24 hours
depending on your content so mostly
white images take much more power and
mostly black ones take much less also
your brightness settings and whether
you're displaying pictures or gifs
affect battery life too now sadly the
beam typically retails for a
preposterous 120 dollars but you can get
25 bucks off by choosing white instead
of the presumably more popular black
which makes it just barely eligible for
this series
there's also another brand called pins
collective that's $10 cheaper but we
haven't tried those and the screen to
body ratio looks slightly worse next up
we've got the Volta XL now you ever may
remember the voltage charging cable from
a previous handy tank but they came back
to sponsor this video because they've
got a new cable that's compatible with
all USB C power delivery devices for
fast charging which is like faster than
regular charging or as I call it slow
charging the more powerful
to excel can push up to 87 watts so
that's enough to charge a MacBook Pro
through its USB type-c magnetic tips
that are even stronger than before and
like before you simply plug the tip into
your device at this end of the device
and leave it there snapping the magnetic
cable on when it's time to charge the
lower power Volta which has also been
redesigned and is available for non fast
charging devices has tips for all sorts
of ports but while they plan to release
lightning port compatible tips for the
Volta XL in the future that's contingent
on their IndieGoGo campaign going well
so check it out at the link below and to
get cheaper shipping in an early-bird
$35 price next also for $35 we've got a
trip down nostalgia Lane for anyone born
between 1975 and the year 2000 just
kidding it's dysentry everyone's
favorite settler simulator Oregon Trail
is now a convenient handheld game it's
the same little trail you remember that
is unless your elementary school had
Apple machines in its computer lab in
which case the hunting is super
different complete with 8-bit sound the
ability to save your game and of course
measles you thought I was gonna say
snakebite didn't you well I might have
but I didn't want to this joke to die of
exhaustion hahaha the blocky form factor
is comfortable for adult sized hands but
I do really wish that they had made the
screen bigger especially since they've
clearly got the space for it but I don't
know I mean hey at least it comes with
batteries so I'm recommending that you
go out and get yourself one of these at
a grueling pace
next up how do I turn the volume in
there we go you can bring your Windows
10 desktop PC to the 21st century with
these nifty windows hello peripherals
I've got two here from different brands
the first is a USB fingerprint reader
from pqi for 30 bucks
there is zero installation for this
thing you just plug it into an available
USB port head to your Windows sign in
options and add your fingerprint you can
add up to 10 fingerprint IDs and then
each ID can have multiple prints stored
so it's good for the whole family
it's phyto certified it's got built-in
breath sensing and it can be used to
login to password managers like LastPass
and n pass sticking it in your towers
front i/o lets you unlock the machine in
a tenth of a second at least if your
hands are dry if your hands are wet then
it's probably better to have this one
facial recognition damn it it's better
to have this one this facial recognition
camera from Mouse is twice the price
but your machine will also be unlocked
before your butt hits the chair and you
can use it as a crummy webcam my main
gripe with this thing is just that the
weight of the cable can kind of pull the
camera off kilter but your mileage may
vary on that one finally for the Mac
people out there one more thing
this beautiful USB C hub from Satechi is
designed for Thunderbolt 3 equipped IMAX
and iMac pros that aren't broken and it
installs effortlessly into the vents on
the bottom of the screen
lord knows those vents had to do
something and it sure isn't cooling
right now finally you don't have to use
the old reach-around technique every
time you want to plug something in
though you do still have to use two
hands to keep the whole machine from
sliding because I guess a you know
rubber piece on the bottom of the
aluminum stand was too much to ask for
the hub offers SD and micro SD ports
three USB 3.0 ports and one USB type-c
port but be aware that the hub is
unpowered so we don't
command charging your phone or
especially high draw devices like
tablets through it but the USB spec does
include a minimum level of power
delivery and we were able to plug in
three LED backlit keyboard
simultaneously so you shouldn't have to
worry too much about power management
compared to older USB 2 hubs also bonus
points attached II for doing such a dang
good job with the color matching now for
the transparency bit of this video we
reached out to be m'f entick for their
smart pin and we bought everything else
you see in this video from Amazon with
our own money except for the Volta XL
cable since this edition of Handy tech
was sponsored by Volta the new Volta XL
is super durable and hard to tangle and
it even has that cool OTG feature so you
can use one phone to charge another one
