pax always be great but what made it
great this year well today Linda is
going to help us go through all the top
five experiences of pax prime 2015 and
experience can be essentially anything
just what made the show awesome if you
want to see more videos on PAC stay
subscribe to see us check out pax east
in boston in march rocket league had
arguably the most talked-about
tournament of the whole event despite
not hosting it in the main convention
buildings the tournament was hosted in
an auxiliary theater not that this is a
bad thing at all it just makes it a lot
harder to get them proper exposure then
there was the lands there's two main
public computer lands at PAX first you
have the pc freeplay section where
anyone can sit down and play a whole
slew of games for about half an hour
before getting booted out to wait in the
line again then there's BYOC which
stands for bring your own computer this
area is somewhat protected and only
those with special badges can get in
both of these lands were completely
consumed by the sounds of rocket League
of course there are a few people playing
league of legends or using their super
expensive computers is lightning fast
Facebook machines but you could
constantly hear shouts yelling and
cheers from the rocket League players
there were even multiple in-house
tournaments set up by random attendees
because there wasn't an official land
tournament for rocket League which says
a lot in my opinion next up we have the
PAX 10 in Penny arcade's own words each
year a group of 50 industry experts
select the 10 best indie games in
regards to gameplay and overall fun
factor if you guys remember videos from
previous pax events you may also
remember my old top five in the indie
mega booth videos so this kind of thing
is right up my alley this year they
chose Adventures of PIP assault Android
cactus battle chef Brigade dark eco
darkest dungeon from light grapple ninja
tag tumblestone and Tsar vaught I feel
like we need to get the devs of darkest
dungeon and from light to talk to each
other to make an illumination neutral
game nah terrible pun anyways the top 10
this year was great but I did notice
something interesting and that
interesting thing was assault Android
cactus if you check out this video
you'll see that last year in my top five
I actually selected assault Android
cactus not try to make a point about how
I can predict the future or anything
just an interesting fact one of my
personal favorites is number three the
sheer amount of VR demos a suicide demos
HTC had demos and Vidya had demos oculus
had demos and more it felt like every
few booths I would go to had some sort
of VR headset ready to go along with it
and there was long lines for each one
not a ton has changed fundamentally in
the VR space since I covered it last it
feels much more like valve and oculus
are now focusing on polish instead of
game-changing features which at this
point in the game is probably the right
thing to do here's the VR making waves
in 2016 then there was of course what
Linus and I covered from Intel's drone
zone and a bunch of random attendees
trying to beat cloud nine players at
random stuff to Hardware glower and a
couple system showcases this you was
packed with awesome stuff which I hope
you guys enjoyed some
shows that I go to I have a hard time
kind of finding enough stuff to cover
you for you guys this year however
everything seemed to kind of fall into
my lap and there ended up actually being
in excess of videos which definitely
isn't a bad thing pax prime and gamescom
are always interesting events because
it's basically foreshadowing of the
holiday seasons releases which for both
games and hardware is often pretty epic
finally no matter how cheesy it is the
people attending PAX Prime and hosting
PAX Prime are always the best thing
about it say what you will about gamers
online and honestly if it's negative
you're probably right with different
communities being known for how
aggressive and antagonizing they are and
with developers building functions into
their games to attempt to stop people
from being dicks it's pretty clear that
the gaming community may not necessarily
be a well of positivity that seems to
change in person however at PAX people
are accepting talkative helpful and
generally seem happy to see you this was
my 10th year at PAX Prime and I can
honestly say that even though it's grown
so much and people have come and gone
over the years I've never failed to bump
into a small army of awesome people
whether it's just chilling and hanging
out in byoc waiting in an absurdly long
line together or just asking random
questions of each other I can accurately
assume that the average attendee will be
warm and welcoming person and while it
may seem cheesy that's pretty damn cool
