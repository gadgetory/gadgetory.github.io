brought to you by phantom glass visit
store dot phantom dot glass for the best
iron screen protectors out there as well
as HyperX
hidden away in the dark recesses of the
asus rog room we have the greatest
announcement of all time this is the rog
enthusiast sli bridge this is the star
of the show they've got four-way SLI
bridges
they've got two-way sli bridges they
light up
they've got metal finish they're on
graphics cards no I'm just kidding not
that at all I mean those are coming and
those are cool but the star of the show
here is the rog swift PG - 7 AQ the a is
for 4k and for IPS and for fast response
- I don't know what the a stands for I
don't understand what these guys are
talking about half the time but
basically it's exactly the same as the
PG 2 7 8 Q the previous g-sync monitor
that we had that we saw from them so
it's a 144 hertz 2560 by 1440 the one
that I personally declared to be one of
the only high-end gaming monitors that
matters the one that is sitting on my
desk personally right now on my gaming
rig because I think it's absolutely
fantastic the idea is exactly the same
so we get those beautiful slim bezels we
get that super flexible stand including
all the adjustments that you could
possibly want you got your pivot your
swivel your height adjust your tilt all
that good stuff but what's been updated
is the panel instead of 2560 by 1440 now
we get a 27 inch 4k panel it's a 60
Hertz panel because quite frankly we
don't have display technology that can
drive 144 Hertz 4k and when we do I'm
sure a soos is going to try and figure
out how to Frankenstein that into a slim
bezel me a beautiful ID thing and then
the other main difference is that now so
it's 4k 60 Hertz it is IPS so because we
don't need those lightning fast refresh
rates 144 Hertz now we can go with IPS
as long as the necessary work goes into
making sure that it not only looks great
it's a 10 bit panel so you're going to
get that beautiful color reproduction
with supported video cards and supported
applications but you also want to
make sure that it actually performs well
enough for gaming so some tuning has to
go into making sure that this monitor is
going to make sense for gamers if
they're going to go ahead and put the
ROG branding on it what they're working
on right now is how to get the response
time dialed in to the point where it'll
be acceptable and we're not really sure
what the spec is going to be right now
in fact we're not even going to be
you're not even sure if it's going to
have single DisplayPort input just like
the existing rog swift or if it's going
to support multiple inputs we're not
sure it we're not sure a lot of things
but they're aiming for five to six
millisecond response times as a weighted
average across the panel so this is
pretty much the star of the show as far
as the ROG suite goes here looks
absolutely stunning although we're not
really anywhere near an actual release
yet I mean we're looking at what to have
three to six months at least for this
guy I'm getting the nod from JJ Overlook
I'm here with JJ cz hi JJ hello
everybody how you guys doing
everybody loves JJ so uh fit oh he's
taking he's taking shots at me but
fortunately I didn't give him my mic so
you guys didn't have to you didn't have
to hear him tease me does it all the
time off camera anyway guys thank you
for checking out our overview of the PG
2 7 aq honestly 4k makes a ton of sense
to me for g-sync because with a very
powerful rig like the kinds of people
who are buying $800 gaming monitors like
the like the RG Swift that already
exists these guys are buying high-end
graphics cards in 2560 by 1440 is
demanding but it's not that demanding
for a high end graphics card and as long
as you're running at a high enough
refresh rate it's going to look kind of
great regardless g-sync really comes
into its own when you dip below 60fps
when you would really start to feel that
chug otherwise so with this guy when
that inevitably happens anywhere down to
around even as low as kind of like 40 to
45 maybe 43 to 45 FPS it's still going
to feel very very smooth and I'm really
excited for this product anyway guys a
huge thank you to our sponsors phantom
