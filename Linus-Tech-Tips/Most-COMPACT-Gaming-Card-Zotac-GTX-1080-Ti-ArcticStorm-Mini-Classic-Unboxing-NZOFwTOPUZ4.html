update on the dual socket 56 core
machine I got my heatsink from Super
Micro I got my instructions look at this
color color instructions Wow amazing
I got my cooler and I specifically said
I specifically said the motherboard uses
the square ilm it doesn't match up
because these are for the narrow ilm and
the motherboard uses the square ilm and
I cried first I was sad and then I was
mad and then I was super excited because
I actually had something that might even
be cooler to show off to you guys so
check this out this is the world's
highest box to card-sized ratio video
card that has existed in at least 10
years because this used to be a thing
like I remember back when a soos would
have video card boxes that were
literally like this big chain Tec like
those companies they had these giant
boxes and the idea was that they were
too cheap to buy shelf space to buy
frontage space in the retail stores
right because that's what you have to do
that's how the retail industry works
they were too cheap to buy the
placements so they just made these
gigantic boxes so they wouldn't have to
pay but they would have to get a ton of
space on the shelf isn't it brilliant I
mean where's chain attack at today right
anyway so ZOTAC has apparently just
reused a box from an existing GT x10
atti you would think except that this
arctic storm
thing here that looks like a sticker in
this mini these aren't stickers they
specifically went out of their way to
create this this gigantic box for this
tiny graphics card but its size should
not
not dissuade you it should not tell you
anything about its power because this is
a full-fledged GT X 1080 Ti and it is
the size of like a 1050 so ZOTAC has not
only engineered a full 1080 TI into
something that is the same size as their
previous 1080 mini they have also
created a fully custom water cooling
solution so you can see here they've got
they've got coverage for the V RMS right
here
they've got pads on the memory modules
right here and right down this side and
then they've got a GPU contact area for
the 1080 Ti so they have created a fully
custom water block solution for it as
well now I do have some misgivings about
their water block design it does not
appear to be all copper which depending
on your loop configuration may be an
issue for you or may not I'm actually a
huge fan of what ek is done with their
aluminium lineup of products all
aluminium products that are lower cost
and designed to go together but if
you're mixing and matching you can run
into issues even if you use anti
corrosive additives so what all we got
here we do get a DVI port we get three
DisplayPort ports we get one HDMI we get
a slightly taller than a PCI bracket PCB
so they have cheated a little bit there
but you kind of kind of give them give
them that because realistically with all
of this space on the top for the
connections you were I mean you were
gonna have to have a bit more space
above the card in your case anyway now
one thing I wish they had done was
rather than come out this way I wish
that they had gone with fittings on the
top and on the bottom like this but
again I'm you know I got to go easy on
them dual 8 pin connectors so I would
expect to be able to overclock the
stuffing out of this thing and
in terms of included accessories they
got a couple six to eight pins and then
they've got a couple of 3/8 inch
fittings I remember I still remember
back when half-inch fittings used to be
the the cat's pajamas and all
interesting I think these are aluminum
okay so yeah it's aluminum block
intended to be used with aluminum
products I would recommend or at the
very least make sure you use a healthy
mix of anti corrosive additive all right
so to fully appreciate the scale of this
thing I want to show it next to a couple
of other cards first of all here is a
Titan XP collector's edition so it is
that much shorter it is a little bit
taller see this there we go so it is a
little bit taller but it should
theoretically actually that would be
really interesting it should only take
up a single PCIe slot if you were going
to cut off the DVI port like we did in
our single slot Titan mod then compared
to one of the most ginormous graphics
cards of all time the 6990 this thing
has way more power much smaller size and
it'll run completely silently assuming
that you have a water cooling loop cool
so there you have it I don't really have
a standard outro for these classic
unboxings subscribe and like and maybe
we'll run the credits if someone other
than me chops it together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
