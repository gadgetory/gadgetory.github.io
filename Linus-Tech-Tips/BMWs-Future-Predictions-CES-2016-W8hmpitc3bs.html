and behind me we've got the BMW I vision
future interaction okay it's a little
awkwardly names but it's a concept car
based on the Spyder that's a little bit
more than the typical concept car that
you might see at an Auto Show the first
thing most people notice about it is the
fact that there's no doors but that's
actually not the point at all it'll have
doors in the future and you have to get
inside to fully realize that this is not
you know your Grandpa's car with
push-button transmission in fact it has
almost no buttons inside it at all nor
is it the couch on wheels concept that
you might expect from other automakers
who are attempting to make well you know
the autonomous car of the future a
vision future interaction is about a
user experience so obviously there's a
lot of technology in this car but it
doesn't necessarily need to be visible
with that I think very often people
mistake that technology has to be there
or has to be celebrated in a certain way
but they forget that it also introduces
complexity to the user so in a nutshell
what BMW is trying to do here is fuse
the right pieces of technology with
their existing strength the actual
experience of operating the machine with
that said one of the most
forward-looking things about it to me
was actually the seat design the second
I sat in it with someone else the most
natural thing for me to do based on the
the shape and orientation of the seats
was rest my arm on the center armrest
and have a casual conversation I mean
how amazing is that
which isn't to say that inside the car
there isn't some really really cool
technology the first thing that stood
out to me was of course the dual
displays there's a two layer display so
that's a transparent display on top of a
more traditional LCD display directly in
front of the driver as well as a large
super wide panoramic display that
extends all the way from the driver's
side over to the passenger side that can
actually be controlled with
motion sensors on the driver's side or
two banks of motion sensors on the
passenger side as well as buttons that
are integrated into the steering wheel
as well as the side of the car over on
the passenger's side
but there's more to them than meets the
eye and the information displayed on
them is not static the displays they
stand for information when we think
about information we have to think about
relevant information relevant
information to the driver and to the
passengers in the car and that means
that for example different driving
scenarios kind of asked us to deliver
different information to the driver so
an autonomous driving mode you might
have the display in front of you with
pertinent information about nearby cars
for example on the foreground display
with the route actually displayed in the
background since you're not operating
the vehicle anyway so it's a kind of
secondary importance
and then the panoramic display well hey
that might be making full utilization of
its entire width width
you know suggested callers for someone
that you like chatting with when you're
driving and it can connect to your phone
which is pretty cool so it can bring up
the best suggestions so you're not
navigating through a bunch of deep menus
and it might have hey you like media
information for both of you and your
passenger are you compromising the
ultimate driving experience by putting
in this autonomous technology we would
never compromise the ultimate driving
experience in the car this is one of the
driving states that we will stay true to
and and also deliver it in the future
manual driving mode whoa hey you don't
want distractions right so that
panoramic display might shrink all the
way down to just a very small display
and then the one that's in front of you
well now all of a sudden hate your
routes in the foreground because you
kind of gotta follow it right and then
in the background you might have
secondary information like a
topographical map so you can really get
the most out of your experience now
right now in the concept the HUD is
actually not active so the display that
comes up right on the windshield but I
mean in the future who knows what we're
gonna see with stuff like that you know
driving assist like training modes right
so you can take your corner a little bit
faster a little bit better and the car
can actually coach you through it
like you would do in a videogame today
but the story here is actually deeper
than the car and BMW is also showing off
some really cool Internet of Things
stuff around there open mobility cloud
with the idea that the car becomes more
than just a car and more of a more of a
digital hub so the dental they've got is
actually surprisingly cool with this
smart connected mirror concept that
they've created running through a
theoretical demonstration that shows
what life might be like with a connected
home and a connected car so in the
mirror you can actually see your agenda
for the day and all you got to do is you
grab your key fob it takes us out of
that as your confirmation and you walk
out the door the car once you grab the
fob actually pulls itself out of the
garage which opens itself positions
itself in the correct orientation on the
road in front of you
since the climate control so it's
comfortable when you get in and boom off
you go you arrive at work you get out of
the car
and this is where it gets really cool
yet again you gesture at the car okay
you found a parking spot cool pull into
that parking spot car does it completely
by itself really neat too keen feature
then when you're done you walk off to
work and whether you work you know a 1
minute walk from your car whether you're
a lot further from your car it's got
this bump detection feature that
combined with their overhead view allows
you to see a live view of what's going
on near your car and actually sends you
a push notification on your phone if
someone bumps it so you can be like okay
hey I need to make sure that
everything's ok and my car isn't in you
know full-on disaster mode right now
then at the end of the day you use a
smart device so in the demo they were
using a smart watch you go ok ok I'm
ready to signal you you signal the car
to come out of the spot you get in it
drives you home or you drive it home hey
whatever the choice is totally yours you
park it in front of the house don't
bother pulling into the garage go inside
put your key fob in the mirror and boom
car parks itself and the mirrors like
hey so you don't have any appointments
until whenever so I'd suggest you use
solar power to charge the car that's the
most economical way and you can be like
they'll actually hold on I have an
unscheduled thing that I need to go do
right away charging as fast
as you can it costs a little bit more
but hey it's important to me very
freakin cool stuff I think what is very
important to understand is that cars are
becoming more intelligent in the future
they can take over certain tasks
maybe tasks that we don't particularly
enjoy about driving so when we sit in
traffic the car can actually do certain
things we're not necessarily enjoying
and we have time for other things so
basically this concept car shows to you
that there's different scenarios that
make the full drive experience a better
one that was awesome thank you so much
and a huge thank you to BMW for allowing
us to come and have an early look at
what they've got going on here at CES
2016 and I mean by the look of things on
the sound of things well into the future
as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
