part 1 yeah that's how it's gonna be so
today we've got a new challenge instead
of just building a budget PC we're gonna
build a budget PC and then we're going
to water cool it we're gonna have a full
budget of $500 $300 for our computer and
a maximum of $200 for the water cooling
parts but there's a twist we cannot use
any off-the-shelf PC water cooling gear
nada so it'll be judged in 5 sections 1
creativity 2 effectiveness 3 aesthetics
for acoustics and then 5 is just overall
we're gonna have a few ground rules as
usual so number one is its tower only we
don't have to source a monitor and
keyboard and mouse number two is that
there's no pre work or in between work
we weren't allowed to doing research
before the event and when all-out doing
research like after worker and number
three is going to get a bit of a
curveball this time last time we said no
help from friends family co-workers
social media contacts whatever this time
we're going to allow it but the panel of
judges has been instructed that they are
to deduct points from us depending on
how much we take advantage of anyone
other than our own wits and last is it
really rules but we're just going to
define what constitutes as a water
cooling components so there's cooling
blocks so your CPU water block or
potentially GPU water block or whatever
the heck else you decide to cool
fittings tubing radiators fans pumps
reservoirs or the coolant so that's it
let's get started shall we
yeah scrapyard wars me brat yard wards
the time is now 2:30 go for we start
alright you can count it I know mines
right twelve nine thirteen nine eight
seven twelve fifteen twenty eight
thirteen twelve seventeen we are just
gonna charge on out of here as if we
have some idea what's going on let's
just wait bye he's leaving alright I'm
not gonna look at it from your little
waste time by her family it's okay we'll
get their attention they're gone why I
kind of have a plan for this video
there is no performance judgment
criteria so it actually doesn't matter
what PC that we decide to use so instead
of stressing out about building a great
PC I'm gonna go straight for water
cooling parts and I'm just gonna kind of
water cool whatever PC I find something
that's actually critical for me is the
lifeline component
unlike Luke I am planning to use the
lifeline in fact my strategy hinged on
it so much that I was very very afraid
we weren't going to allow them so Luke
and I disagreed strongly about whether
we should be allowed to have any kind of
outside help I said yes he said no and
Nick was actually the one who saved my
bacon here by settling it and saying
okay it should be allowed but the judges
should factor it in because I have a
neighbor who might be able to help me a
little bit with this even though I know
that I'm giving Luke the ability to
leverage his dad who is crazy handy and
has a lot of tools
I want to find a computer really quick
so I can figure out the whole layout for
the socket so that I can try to start
making blocks pretty much immediately so
I don't want to spend a ton of time
looking for a computer but I don't want
it to be like garbage either I'm gonna
go to probably an auto junkyard to find
my radiator I'm heading to the pet store
now for my pump I really don't have a
plan in terms of the reservoir but I'm
hoping that that I can come up with some
kind of a good idea as far as that's
concerned
and then the blocks the blocks are gonna
be the challenge and that's where my
neighbor comes in he has a CNC mill so
we are going to try to actually make a
CPU block like a decent CPU block and a
full cover GPU block that is the plan
right now so let's get some trash talk
going early hey you suck wall yeah take
that Luke what a dick I'm not gonna play
his silly little games time to be a man
okay so we're looking at pumps and uh
hmm these are all air pumps
okay then okay so unfortunately they're
doing some Rica jiggering of their
inventory and the only one they have is
this one right here which is like 80
bucks but they suggested that maybe if
we go to Canadian Tire we can find
something I am interested in finding
something that's submersible though
since one of the judgment categories is
acoustics and having a submersible pump
will make my system very quiet so that
won't help me for now though I mean
really we're not going about this the
most efficient possible way right now
but frankly I'm not that concerned we've
got three days to pretty much build and
water cool a computer and not get run
over so I don't know maybe I should be
more worried but I think we got this hi
there I saw your gaming tower ad on
Craigslist I was just wondering if you
could give me a deal if I didn't take
the monitor keyboard or mouse 200 bucks
yeah okay can I come pick it up right
now cool so he has a it's a classic case
as you can see there you guys are gonna
turn the monitor like that so you guys
remember that case maybe from a long
time ago it's not the greatest looking
case but it's a classic case he does
have a graphics card in it but it's
super boring
it's not the most interesting thing ever
but it'll work I got it for 200 bucks so
I have $100 to splurge on potentially an
old graphics card that looks nice and
potentially a better case because I saw
some cases on there that were like 40
bucks and looks really nice I don't want
to do something as ghetto as like a
sawed-off milk jug but
yeah I don't know what to use maybe like
um maybe like one of those big gulp
drink containers on the top with like
like fittings coming down into the
system or something why not one of those
little goldfish aquarium things like
terrible that you shouldn't use should I
put a goldfish in my loop and a filter
you could store our goldfish in one of
these seems harmless okay
so here's a submersible pump a hundred
and ten dollars that would be literally
over half of our budget
there's cheaper stuff here but like the
cheapest oh no at oh okay
hold on a second the cheapest one is
thirteen dollars but if that's the kind
of flow rate we're talking about and
only a one year warranty but then 20
bucks get a seventy it gets us 75
gallons per hour you know what we should
remember this I'm not going to buy it
now but that actually may be a solution
whenever he's gonna do something that's
like cheating or borderline cheating he
usually makes sure that there's very
defined rules around it so that he knows
specifically how you can go around those
rules so I'm wondering if he's going to
just try to find things that are
essentially the same but are not
technically for water cooling I might
yeah I might source another graphics
card I might source a new case although
this is a fairly classic case so I might
also stick with this guy there's also a
bit of metal I'm gonna be modding it
quite ugly so you
okay so this thing sucks but there's a
lot of metal which I'm actually super
downward beginning a better graphics
card at this point is going to be a
little sketchy because I was pretty sure
in his ad I could totally be wrong but I
was pretty sure in his ad I'm gonna put
this in the back that he showed a 750
watt power supply that might have been
the other computer I was looking at oh
well
I'll figure it out maybe no new graphics
card probably new case because that
one's actually fairly scratched up so
we're gonna go home and try to I go to
princess Auto because if I can get it
block working for the CPU and like
that's going to be the hardest thing so
if I can source some materials and start
trying to make a block work at all and
I'll just make it for the CPU then I'll
then I'll know that I have the
methodology down that I should be able
to do it again for the graphics card so
I'll just do one at once and then try to
reproduce that instead of trying to deal
with getting two of them working at the
exact same time okay so the last real
story I want to go to before I start
calling places and browsing online is
Home Depot just because I think this is
where I can probably find the tubing I
need and that's the one piece of the
puzzle where I'm not even sure if I'm
going to be able to find it use so I
need to know how much that costs before
I shop for everything else
so that whole strategy where you leave
your car unlocked because there's
nothing valuable in it anyway only works
if you don't leave your like razor blade
in your car they're like not that crazy
expensive this this could work if I
decide to bail on the on the reservoir
right then I've got my key line so
250 here at Home Depot so it's time to
do some napkin math let's figure out how
much we know we're spending and then how
much we have we have left to spend so so
buying new a 20 here about 10 here
actually we should call that 25 because
the tax reservoir you know what I think
I'm going to lock into the t line so
that gives us about a hundred and fifty
dollars for radiator so pump we can get
away with saving one by getting us oh no
we can't have a submersible pump now
because of the frezz we need to obtain a
reservoir or use the submersible pump
chute
so Canadian Tire really didn't like us
we got threatened to be thrown in court
so all that footage is gonna be thrown
away but basically they're actually
super helpful auto parts guy got me a
part number for their cheapest radiator
which is a hundred and eight dollars so
that's not that cheap but could be
workable in the budget I know the pump
that I'm looking for is also about forty
five fifty dollars so that's 150 bucks
out of my budget right there and I would
still need metal and fittings and a fish
tank and two
bro we can't afford all that I didn't
think the radiator is gonna be hard
so I would be looking for something
fairly inexpensive but and preferably
with a fan already on it but I'm not
super picky about what exactly it is see
radiator core for 25 dollars I'd be
looking for a car radiator but I just I
don't really care which one it is I'd
just be looking for something relatively
small like do you guys have any salvaged
radiators that I could pick up oh really
Wow you're the you're the first person
with good news that I've talked to in
the last hour um what would I be looking
at for something like that I don't have
a huge budget for it you think you're
not really fuck you - what right here
I'm sure I can Big Joe for 50 bucks okay
all right thank you so much here's some
20 bucks 1/2 inch 1/2 inch gas pipe new
ok let's let's just let's call hi I'm
calling about the copper pipe and I mean
is there anything wrong with it all
right
okay wonderful thank you very much 30 to
50 feet that could work so here for
Rhett we've got two leads on PCs the
plan with the copper tube is that I'm
basically just going to like bend it up
and jam it inside the case so that it
can take advantage of any of the air
flow that's already coming through the
case to cool the CPU and and hopefully
the GPU so there it is there's our
there's our copper copper tubing so in
terms of bendability it looks like I
will be able to hand Bend it I don't
know with what amount of precision we
have our first part again I'm not too
concerned about the PC and we have one
cooling component with leads on most of
the rest what's a good day today
I just realized I'm gonna have a mixed
metal loop I was planning to use a
heater core or something which is a lot
of them are made of aluminum and then I
was planning to make aluminum blocks now
that I have the copper tubing I'm gonna
have to budget for some kind of a
corrosion inhibitor the judges probably
won't know that anyway next time on
scrapyard wars
Linus whips it out my goodness it's so
long Luke goes into a serious situation
with a dremel tool he always had three
fingers right</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
