brought to you by Western Digital Intel
and SteelSeries hey guys I'm here again
at the indie mega booth that dragon
cancer and this is kind of something
really different this isn't something
that I've seen on the floor this isn't
even something that I've really seen in
a video game very often and yeah I think
that's it for me what can you tell me
about this game well my wife Amy and I
have four sons and our third son Joel
has terminal cancer and we've been
fighting that for the past three almost
four years and so this story is about
him and it's about the roller coaster
that's our life in and the hope that can
be found the hope that we found in them
in the shadow of death well it's it is
that deep he's not just exaggerating I
have played through the game it is quite
a moving experience how do you go
through this game at this story well
this first demo scene takes place in a
hospital and it retails a night that I
actually spent with Joel right after
they told us that he was terminal
and they inserted palliative treatment
he got a stomach bug and so he was
hospitalized for dehydration and so this
kind of compresses that six or seven
hours that I spent with him not not
being able to calm him you know like not
being able to do anything to help him
and the helplessness that I felt in that
but then also the grace that I saw at
the end and so like that's what this
that's what this particular scene is
I hate this room it didn't used to for a
for a moment it was an adventure I was
cast as the compassionate and caring
father holed up with his fragile son in
a small cleft in the rocks the storm
raging waves ripping at the sharp black
rocks below and enveloped in my arms he
feels safe
you really just you're kind of in my
head and you're also kind of outside of
outside of me and as I'm kind of stuck
in this hotel room with my son it's
really interesting
playing through that scene because you
feel really connected as a player with
the situation I know I know you were
actually in the situation but as a
player it's it's obviously not the same
thing but you can feel a little bit of
empathy for the situation and then one
thing this obviously won't be in in the
game but in the play chest that I just
had there's the picture of you and your
son right to the left and I felt myself
referencing that picture throughout the
playthrough because it's just it's so
deep and you do really feel that
connection and it's it's it's a
completely different thing because it's
a true story and because it's coming
directly from you you can tell that it's
just there's that much power behind it I
just want them to feel better
it's okay totally Shh
it's really really interesting game is
there anything else you can add well you
know I just I'm a pretty proud father
you know and like I put the pictures
there because I want people to know that
who he is and that picture was taken two
weeks ago and I want him to know how
beautiful he is and just how sweet he is
and and so I also want people to know
that this comes from a very real place
for us I mean this is something where my
wife and I decided that we were going to
approach this project with our deaf
partners in the middle of our experience
you know and to me that was really
important because I think a lot of times
when you approach hard things from
afterwards you know you have a tendency
to like oversimplify those things that
you went through and when you try to
pass them on to people they become off
as like laws and rules about how you're
supposed to live right and so like for
us there's a very important part of
being in the journey and and and
choosing to walk that with other people
because you know there's thousands and
thousands of people here and they all
have their own pain and that pain is
very real to them you know it's not
something we can compare and I just want
to give them a hand and say hey I have
like just a sliver of experience and I
I have an idea of what you might be
going through in a very small way so and
that's it's it's I'm very happy that you
have found a way to be able to develop
this while going through it because
you're sharing an experience with many
people that can't actually feel it but
this is the closest they will possibly
ever be able to be most likely ever be
able to be some ground is that funny
about about about spokes folks how will
someone be able to get this game well so
you know we kind of poured our life
savings into into doing this right and
so and then we kind of ran out of money
so what happened was is who you stepped
up with an investment and and that
allows us to like really commit to this
project full-time and be able to support
and love my family you know
hit at the same time and so it's like
yeah it's like a real blessing and it's
it's just tremendously awesome of them
to step up and do that because they
believe that what we're doing should be
done you know and so we're gonna come to
you first next year and then after that
we'll see where we go great so if you
don't have a new yet definitely check
that out and if you can't check that out
just wait because you should definitely
try this game it is a really big
experience it's totally surreal thank
you for developing this game thank you
