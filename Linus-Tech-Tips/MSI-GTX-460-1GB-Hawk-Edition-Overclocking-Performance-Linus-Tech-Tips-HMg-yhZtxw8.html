outlining the performance I was able to
squeeze out of the msi geforce gtx 460
hot so this feature is the Twin Frozr -
heatsink
it's got dual DVI one mini HDMI and you
can see I've got a bunch of fans blowing
around it right now just kind of put the
camera through there so it takes two
6-pin power connectors as I mentioned in
my unboxing that I did you can see the
voltage check points down here these
fans are going pretty good right now
because I have this thing over bolted
let me see so here is a beta version of
MSI Afterburner that includes full
support for the GTX 460 Hawk so you can
see here the core voltage memory voltage
and auxiliary voltage are all adjustable
so I've turned up I'm just going for max
core right now I haven't actually done
anything with the memory but I was able
to achieve 962 megahertz fully fir mark
stable with the hawk Edition card so
that is what I was able to do and I
haven't tried any 3dmark runs yet but
once I dial in the memory I will I'll
try and get some 3d mark going and then
what I want to do too is compare it to
the GTX 480 so thank you for checking
out my core overclocking video on mihawk
don't forget to subscribe to Linus tech
tips and stay tuned for more updates on
this sweet video card oh hey actually
know before I'm done here's something I
wanted to mention this is a reference
PCB GTX 460 it has the cyclone cooler
from MSI but something I wasn't sure
about in my video with the hawk is
whether or not it is longer than a
reference PCB 460 the answer is yes it's
approximately that much longer
yeah my angle is now right this video is
gonna be all about comparing the GTX 460
Twin Frozr to Hawk from MSI against the
GTX 480 now it's not a completely fair
comparison because I am going to be
overclocking the GTX 460 so here is the
settings that I am running at here so
you can see I'm running at 962 megahertz
on the core and 2.07 3 gigahertz on the
RAM okay so I'm doing that and here's
the score I got in 3dmark Vantage so I
know I have physics on but I'm gonna
have physics on for both cards so it
will be an apples to apples comparison
and this is running a core i7 980 X at
4.15 gigahertz I'm running 6 gigs of
Kingston liquid ready h2o series HyperX
RAM and I'll be back in a moment
when we have to score for the GTX 480 so
remember that number 21 601 for the 460
hawk</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
