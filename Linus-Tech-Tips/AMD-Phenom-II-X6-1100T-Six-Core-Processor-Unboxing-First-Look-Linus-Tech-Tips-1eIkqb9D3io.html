unboxing the fennan 2x6 1100 T so this
is a multi-core processor as you may or
may not have figured out by now it is
also a phenom 2 as you may or may not
have figure out by now this is a Black
Edition processor which means that you
have full control over the CPU
multiplier now that's actually it even
means a little bit it means something a
little bit different than it even used
to because it used to be the Black
Edition menu had one multiplier to
either turn up or turn down according to
your will so it meant ok well you don't
have to fuss around with with adjusting
the the ratio of the actual bus speed
itself you can just turn up the multi
there's your overclock turn up the
voltage you dot well now with the turbo
processor so that is all of the six
cores from AMD right now that have a tee
at the end of the part number have a
feature that allows them to scale up the
frequency when you're running three
cores or less so this processor although
it says 3.3 gigahertz and that's your
stock multiplier also runs at 3.7
gigahertz when you're running with three
active processing threads or less so you
can not only adjust the stock multiplier
but you can also adjust the turbo
multiplier so you can make it so okay
let's say you've decided you know I want
die you know what I'm going to leave my
stock speed when I'm running like
heavily multi-threaded stuff at three
point three gigahertz so that I don't
get more power consumption or so
whatever your reasoning is but I'm going
to turn my turbo up to four gigahertz so
that when I'm running games for example
which only use a few processor cores I
can really get the most out of my CPU so
that's a cool feature alright here is
the processor itself this is an AM 3
processor which means it fits in an am-3
socket as well as a named 2 plus socket
and it is fully compatible with ddr3 as
well as ddr2 memory so AMD is the only
processor main stream processor company
these days that is actually still
producing chips that are compatible with
ddr2 on the high end this is a 6 core
processor that
you can actually plunk into your old
ddr2 board with your ddr2 RAM as long as
your board supports it we also get a
case badge sticker we get a little
warranty certificate of authenticity
installation guide thing a full duct to
about the size of like a wall poster so
I'm not going to open it right now and
then we also have an included stock
heatsink so their stock heatsink hasn't
changed much since the days of socket
939 we've got what appears to be a sixty
millimeter fan it is manufactured by AVC
it uses a four pin pwm fan header and
here's a little tip for you guys if you
want it to look tidy or in your case
twist it up like this that way instead
of being like a total mess when you plug
it into your into your fan header and
like looking like this you can actually
have it just all sort of come together
like that and then you can plug it in
somewhere and then kind of twist it up
like that so it's sort of more uniform
anyway it has four heat pipes two of
them go one way two of them go the other
way you've got a pre applied thermal pad
and the thermal pad that comes on stock
heat sinks from actually both major CPU
companies these days are pretty darn
good so you don't really need to replace
it unless you really want to and your
standard AMD mounting mechanism thank
you for checking out my unboxing of the
phantom 2 x6 1100 T also don't forget to
check out my build guide featuring this
processor in AMD's best of the best
machine which happens to be sitting over
in that room right now you can sort of
see it anyway check it out on my NCIX
comm channel as well as my my vision
system overview where I show some
benchmarks from this particular
processor against its competition don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
