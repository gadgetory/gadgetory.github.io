something that looks quite plain and
ordinary on the outside but is actually
a pretty sweet product so today we have
the intel SSD 320 I have only one
capacity low does come in a variety of
capacities including 40 gig 80 gig 120
gig 160 gig 300 gig and even 600
gigabytes of total capacity now the SSD
320 is not meant to be a performance
King successor to the Intel 510 series
Drive that was just released no rather
this is meant to be a value segment part
so unlike the 510 which does not use 25
nanometer flash for higher densities the
SSD 320 does okay so it uses higher
density flash it doesn't use as advanced
a controller as some of the other drives
on the market so it doesn't do any data
compression while it's reading and
writing for example which means that it
does not offer the same performance but
it should offer outstanding reliability
as we've come to expect from Intel
products of all sorts be it motherboards
CPUs and now SSDs and should offer a
good price to performance ratio now
performance is a little bit better than
SandForce
then the older last generation SandForce
drives using the same force 1200
controller but it is not up to par with
something like a 510 or with a newer
SandForce 2281 controller SSD drive
alright so the first thing we find
inside is an installation guide designed
for easy installation they can be
quickly incorporated into a computer
getting started handling precautions and
installation instructions very nice
speed demon sticker and shiny - yes SSDs
are fast even this a mainstream SSD is
really friggin fast it uses a SATA 2
controller which means that it doesn't
have the benefit of doesn't include a
two and a half to three and a half inch
adapter so you'll need to buy one if
you're going to install it in the
desktop and you
have a case that natively support
student half-inch dreads so while it is
a mainstream drive remember it was only
last generate the last generation of
products where the vertex to reigned
supreme and this is faster than a vertex
- so we're only one generation behind
the high-performance parts in terms of
performance on this mainstream part so
the drive looks pretty typical this
looks pretty much oh this is kind of
interesting actually check this out so
compared to the you know what I actually
have a 5-10 handy I apologize for the
state of my workbench here right now but
there's my 510 with kind of a Goldy
finish on it on my test bench you see
that okay so look at the 510 now look at
the 320 so the 320 brings back this
little plastic piece here which
increases the compatibility of this
drive so you can install it even in
notebooks that require a slim-to-none
inch profile just by taking out the four
screws which are not marked with
warranty void if remove tabs you just
take those four out take off this
plastic piece and put the four screws
back in and now all of a sudden you have
a slimmer profile drive so this spacer
here is so that it'll also install
easily in computers that do not require
the slimmer drive so on the front you'll
find information like the part number
basically think of this you guys as an X
25m Gen 2 refresh so think of it as X
25m Gen 3 it's still stated - it's still
a performance drive by all means but it
is not necessarily meant to be the
performance crown holder ok Intel's own
products actually Eclipse it in terms of
performance
remember the 510 series not only
features a more advanced controller but
also SATA 3 and 34 nanometer flash which
does not provide the same density this
25 nanometer but in general does perform
better at this time so here we go we've
got our standard SATA power interface as
well as our SATA 2 data interface all
the mounting holes that we've come to
expect are here with 2 on the side here
two on the side here and four on the
bottom thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the intel SSD 320 series
