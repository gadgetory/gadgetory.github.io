about the sheer scale of the
Coolermaster cosmos to which I mentioned
in my unboxing video was one of the
heaviest and largest cases I'd ever
encountered
but what I didn't realize was just how
big it was because I hadn't been a
direct side-by-side comparison so before
we get to go any further in this video
I'd like to present to you my personal
machine this is a silverstone TJ of
seven this is a very very large computer
case full tower and over here are my
other comparison pieces the Corsair 800
d which is a beast and the fractal
design define R 3 which is not a beast
this is a mid Tower and here in the
middle
dwarf in the mall is the cooler master
cosmos s so you can see that it is
clearly even before you add the
transform loop and I tripped the
transportation rails on the top it stems
well over the Obsidian 800 d and I mean
if they were both people the define R 3
would be standing like you know River
height on the cosmos - okay in terms of
their their their depth here if you want
to come and do like a top-down view here
I'm actually gonna move the light so you
guys can see a little bit better so you
can see the depth of the cosmos - all
that room for radiators comes at some
cost if you just want to like hold it
right up so they can see how much deeper
it is so it is actually deeper than the
Obsidian 800 D as well as being taller
than it and look at the width so I want
you guys to look at the width of the
cosmos - compared to a case like the 800
D which is already quite wide indeed ok
so now let the comparisons continue
because this case is not for the faint
of heart
I'm gonna go ahead
sorry guys I'm gonna go ahead and I'm
gonna put it up on this desk just to
show you guys what it will look like
with your standard sort of
run-of-the-mill Ikea desk and what it'll
look like with a cosmos 2 on it
you better have a big monitor otherwise
it's gonna look stupid next to this
thing here we go
50 pounds no big deal who needs to work
out when you're a nerd who builds
computers in cases like this right okay
here we go all right so he gave you guys
some idea that is a 24 inch monitor that
is not by any stretch of the imagination
a small monitor here come get this angle
over here this is pretty good
so there it is from this angle you can
really see how it absolutely dwarfs the
24 inch LCD monitor that it is next to
and the cat that is also next to it so
that is my 30-inch monitor I don't have
anywhere to put it down because it won't
even fit on my desk next to that thing
but here is what it would look like next
to it
Wow yeah I mean you could kill a man
with this thing there you go so that is
a 30-inch monitor and this case makes it
look like a child's toy in fact it even
makes my own Silverstone gdo7 which is a
pretty big case by most accounts look
like a plaything so I'm gonna line up
the backs of them so that you guys can
get some idea of that of the scale here
so that's how much deeper it is Benanti
jo7 that's how much taller it is then
it's tjo 7 I'm gonna get you some better
lighting there and that is how much
wider it is then even a silverstone TJ
oh seven case so in summary you better
have a serious machine if you're going
to put it in a serious case like this
and
don't forget to subscribe to Linus tech
tips for more unboxings reviews at least
it's like solidly built right check this
out ah yeah for more right the kinds of
videos that I do thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
