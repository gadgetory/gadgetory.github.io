supply it is an 80 plus model with a 5
year warranty it is also sli ready and
i'm gonna get a little bit more into
that in a minute I actually just did
recently a a bit of a feature on a power
supply that I would recommend for kind
of a basic configuration you know
onboard video or a basic to mid-range
video card but this is what I would
consider more like a step-up model so
when you're starting to look into
getting like a gaming setup this is sort
of where I would begin your searches
with something like a anything in about
the 550 to 650 watt range is going to be
pretty good as long as you're running a
single card but you know what why don't
I focus on the unboxing first because
I'm getting a little bit distracted here
ok so let's have a look at the basic
features of the TX 650 it is 80 plus ok
that's pretty good it is here this is a
big one for power supply quality is that
many power supplies are actually rated
at unrealistically low temperatures and
any power supply is going to operate
more efficiently at a low temperature
that goes for many many electronics this
power supply is guaranteed to deliver
its rated specs even at a reasonably
high temperature that's a big one okay
you got a dedicated single 12 volt rail
so it doesn't matter what you plug into
what connector you're never going to
trigger your over current protection and
then we've got high quality Japanese
capacitors and we have compatibility
guaranteed with dual GPU configurations
that goes into the hole sli ready thing
I think that pretty much covers it for
the basic specs and then we have the
connectors included which is covered by
a sticker very conveniently I'm going to
go ahead and remove that sticker from
the okay I'm not going to remove that
sticker from the box why don't we just
look at the connectors when we open it
up make life easier for myself I went
and opened it from the wrong side well
that's not very good is it
my ruler nice today slice that open okay
so let's have a look at the TX 650 it
comes with the same manual as the TX 750
there's some good stuff in there I'm
sure that if you buy one you'll read it
next we have a power cord this is just
your bog-standard PC power cord yeah of
course there includes some black zip
ties so you can manage your cables
without using ugly clear plastic zip
ties and they have a little powered by
corsair sticker very nice they also
include some black thumb screws goes
along with the overall black finish of
this unit use black thumb screws to
attach it to your case instead of the
standard silver ones alright let's have
a look at the connectors included on
this power supply and I do want to talk
a little bit more about my whole power
supply selection guide that I'm sort of
working on here now I recommended the
see sonic 400 watt for our basic power
supply this like I said before is where
I would start for more like a gaming or
a more powerful system power supply so
if you're configuring your system with
something like a core i7 CPU or you're
putting in a dedicated video card like a
Radeon 58 50 or higher you should be
starting at around a 550 to a 650 watt
quality power supply you can see that as
you step up into a more a gaming
oriented power supply you start to see a
few key improvements over a more generic
one so first of all you've got a black
finish because many gaming cases have
window these windows these days and so
it can be important for the aesthetic
look of your system to have a black
power supply rather than like a grey
hunk of unfinished metal sitting in the
bottom that's one of the reasons that
people tend to choose a more gaming
oriented power supply next you got
sleeve cables so instead of your rainbow
of colors coming out of the power supply
and then running all over your case
you've got nice black cables that will
just kind of terminate in just a little
bit of color it gives a much tidier look
and it has the additional benefit of not
blocking air flow as much because when
you bundle the cables together it's
easier for the air flow to get around it
and not cause dust build-up then if you
have it all kind of running like this
acting as a as a web to catch all that
dust and random stuff okay so we'll have
a quick look at this power supply just
in general you got your Corsair TX
sticker on this
I'd very sharp-looking their power
supply's always look good
you've got you're rated amperages on the
top of the unit so you can see I talked
a little bit in my C Sonic 1 about how a
strong 12 volt rail is so important to a
good quality power supply this 650 watt
unit can provide 624 watts almost its
entire output on the 12 volt rail very
cool very good to see next we've got a
standard 120 millimeter fan you tend to
see 120 millimeter fans and most of the
gaming units because they do run quieter
and the last thing you want when you you
know fire up your gaming computers to
hear nothing but the sound of your PC
rather than the actual sound of the
games next you've got an on/off switch
at the back standard honeycomb grill as
well as a power plug in terms of
connectors gaming power supplies you'll
find all of the standard stuff so you're
going to have your 4 plus 4 or 8 pin CPU
connector you're going to have your 24
pin motherboard connector next you're
going to find lots and lots of SATA
cables so this power supply can actually
accept up to 8 hard drives natively with
4 SATA cable 4 SATA connectors on two
dedicated cables so a gaming power
supply a more high end power supply is
going to give you more expansion options
for the future because you've just got
more connectors next you've got a bunch
of molexes usually you don't run into
shortages on those these days and then
this so our 400 watt unit only had a
single PCI Express connector whereas
this one has two 6+2 pin PCI Express
connectors that means that you could
either plug in two video cards that each
except one so you could plug in a couple
of 50 770's or a couple of older
generation ones or you can plug in one
video card that takes an 8 pin and a 6
pin something like a 5970 so like a dual
GPU graphics card would run very
comfortably off something like a TX 650
or you could plug in two separate video
cards that each take 8 pin connectors so
you've got a lot more options when you
start to move up into a higher quality
unit so
basically what I would say is if you're
configuring a gaming system and you're
planning to maybe go SLI or crossfire in
the future with a couple of sort of
mid-range GPUs this is where I would
start
and then looking at sort of other units
in that particular price range</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
