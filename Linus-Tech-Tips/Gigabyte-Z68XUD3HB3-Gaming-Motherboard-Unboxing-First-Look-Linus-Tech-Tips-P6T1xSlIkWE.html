X ud3 hb3 so this has most of the
features you have come to expect from
gigabyte including touch BIOS hybrid EFI
technology which allows you to use three
terabyte plus hard drives
a three year warranty in the US and
Canada ultra durable three it's got
nvidia sli ambi crossfire and it
supports all the latest intel core i3 i5
and i7 processors on LGA 1155 let's look
around on the back of the board and have
a look if they have anything else to say
for themselves yes we've got dual BIOS
which allows you to restore it to the
other physical BIOS chip even if you
corrupt the BIOS during a flash we have
3x USB power allows you to charge more
powerful devices and run more powered
devices off a hub than you can on
competing motherboards we have USB 3 SE
the 3 6 gigabit per second and driver
MOSFETs which reduces mounting area by
50%
apparently interesting the onboard audio
foods a 108 decibels sound to noise
ratio and that is definitely a good
thing more sound less noise always a
plus we have 4 SATA cables included 2
straight to right angle we have an i/o
shield which has convenient color coding
on it we have a little warning telling
you not to put a socket 1156 cpu in this
board and we have an SLI cable next we
have a user's manual with a useless
utility DVD download the latest off the
gigabyte website to make sure you have
the latest versions finally a Dolby home
theater sticker and a multilingual
installation guidebook next we have the
board itself which has phone look at
that never seen foam on a motherboard
like that before and I'm not even being
facetious I have never seen foam mounted
on a motherboard like that so let's go
ahead and find out why it has foam
take that out Oh beautiful motherboard
especially far like a value price point
board so there you go that is - I'm
gonna go ahead and guess prevent the
MOSFET heatsink from moving around
during shipping there you go because it
does use plastic pushpins so while those
are not a risk while the board is
stationary while it's being moved around
yeah it could loosen the bond between
the thermal compound and the MOSFETs
themselves so let's have a look at the
overall layout of this guy right here
we're gonna start with our 1155 socket
in the middle of the board so that's
where you put your CPU then we're gonna
move on to our looks like one two two
five six plus one phase power design
we've got our eight pin connector in the
top left of the board in its ideal
location we've got our dual channel ddr3
RAM over here on the side and our 24 pin
connector also in its ideal location
we've got seven SATA ports so this is
say two three six gigabit per second
right here is say two three six gigabits
per second and we've got three SATA -
three gigabit per second so this one's
running off the Intel chipset this one's
running off a third-party chipset these
ones are going to be your higher
performing ones and these are your
fallbacks the last SATA port is going to
be on the back panel of the motherboard
and I'm a big fan of that running Intel
off the Intel chipset because it can be
more convenient for raid configurations
here our front panel connectors as well
as our front USB 3.0 firewire powered
front USB remember you can charge a
tablet off the one with the red
background and then one two three more
front USB headers in terms of the PCI
slot layout we've got one two three PCI
1 X 2 PCI 16 X although this one is only
wired electrically to 8 X and 2 PCI
slots this is a very very solid layout
because it's going to give you two PCI
One X and one PCI left if you install
two dual slot cards on the back here
we've got a variety of good features
remember this is a z68 motherboard so we
have video out including VGA DVI HDMI
and DisplayPort yes everything is
supported we've got one two three four
USB 2.0 ports one of those ps2 keyboard
mouse combo ports optical audio out
firewire eSATA off the Intel chipset two
USB 3.0 ports and Gigabit Ethernet and
7.1 audio out so I would say an ideal
type configuration for a motherboard
like this is making sure that you've
bought a nice decent quad-core CPU I
mean if you're going to get the z6
a chipset you might as well go for a
quad-core this is a high-end chipset
also you're going to want to put most
people aren't going to be running SLI or
crossfire on a board like this solo you
will have the options maybe go with a
value board like our value part like a
good bang for I shouldn't say value
because they're still expensive but a
bang for the buck card like a GTX 560 or
a Radeon 68 70 something along those
lines Ram is so cheap these days so I
probably throw me eight gigs of RAM I
throw an SSD in here remember this board
supports lucid virtu so you can use the
onboard video here out the onboard video
here and still use your dedicated
graphics for games but you can use this
one to do video transcoding and it also
supports Intel SRT technology so you can
take a sixty gigas SD even a safe a 3:1
throw it on the SATA 3 port and then
throw a big hard drive like a WD black
on one of the other ports in order to
use the SSD as a cache for awesome
performance without blowing a bunch of
money on 120 or 240 gig SSD thank you
