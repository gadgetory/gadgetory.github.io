broke agency I was gonna yeah to be fair
not a full minute but we are early
welcome to the wine show of 28th of
April 2017 yeah we have some really cool
topics one of them being that acer has
announced their most badass gaming
monitor yet which is pretty sick the FCC
announced is it plan to reverse title 2
of net neutrality which I don't
personally know a ton of Oaks I'm a
Canadian we were like no that but John
will have much better insights on that
topic
Amazon's Alex with an A ah learns to
talk like a human which is cool
Elon Musk at a TEDx conference in
Vancouver teases a little bit of the
Tesla electric semi truck which is
pretty cool and for new gigafactory
locations which is pretty ridiculous and
yeah there was one more thing oh my god
I keep on double clicking with my
touchpad and I'm a super noob Nintendo
is launching a new 2d s XL which is like
flippy and stuff which is what the three
es probably should have been this whole
time so it could have been cheaper and
that 3d option would have just never
been there which would have been
completely fine and that's the show this
week intro Rowley intro look at it work
like that don't you like that we just
press a button if I can just tap it it's
so pretty
the Manchus
oh my god like that means a mechanic
spectrum glasses and coolermaster and
move that back up there and go back
alright so first things first that crazy
monitor let's get up to the top here do
it um a sirs new gaming monitor the
notes and the docs say that it is 44
Hertz but my extremely techy brain was
like there's no way that's accurate
thanks a lot James yeah yeah so it's 144
Hertz HD our 4k uhd monitor super badass
want to keep talking about it yeah
they threw luke said um being billed as
the nicest Acer or gaming monitor that
acer has ever made um there we go it has
a local dimming for better contrast
which is actually pretty cool yeah so
that that's part of the HDR bit where
than all the different zones and it can
like turn off different zones to get
better darkness and contrast so yeah
that one's a better solution is to get
better contrast four milliseconds of
response time it doesn't say what kind
of a panel it is I believe it will be in
what four milliseconds it will be an IPS
so like a little bit quicker IPS and
should look fairly nice which is cool
mm-hmm
also has HDMI 2.0 I don't know if HDMI
2.1 has made us Wayne's onto any
consumer devices yet but if you want to
run for case if she hurts on this
monitor you can do it through HDMI 2.0
uh you probably shouldn't though it's
144 Hertz monitor you're gonna want to
ah yes
run at $100 for her so yeah maybe if
your graphics card like Lenore powered
but yeah yeah I don't know if you want
to like but for some reason have
multiple inputs plugged in at once yes
and you want to run something that
doesn't need the fork 844 it's you can
totally do that which is cool like like
like right now if you had say this thing
the analogue NT which you guys can't see
but it's right off camera you want to
have that plugged in and your computer
you could totally do that yep and it
also has Toby eye-tracking gulped in so
okay if you can scroll back up a little
bit there if you're wondering with that
kind of bar on the right
right here that is what that would be as
an eye tracker so interesting Toby's
been an interesting technology to follow
because I tried them out at a CES yeah
like quite a few years ago and like
admittedly it was not very good it was
pretty bad it was a little bit of a work
in progress and I saw it as well yeah
but it's kind of been a while I know
seven if you guys know 7's big streamer
he has it permanently mounted on the
bottom of his monitor and he's done some
streams where he used it and he says
that it was pretty cool and I had him
try it in front of me excels like OBS
and it worked well for him so I'm
assuming that it's gotten better over
time which is cool
I will also want to take a couple more
words about that local dimming this
monitor has so apparently it's 384
different backlighting zone yeah so the
amount of control the monitor can exert
over one tiny little section is actually
pretty high but you do need you do need
a 10 Series Nvidia graphics card so a
1080 or 1070 something like that with
the DisplayPort 1.4 connector but that
should not be very difficult to find
this the modern standard yeah yeah yeah
that's that's one thing about HDR with
all the individually controllable what
the heck but I felt like an accessor I
rode on it let's see let's see yeah what
it looks like so I wonder if that comes
with it we'll see here I didn't notice
anything about that I do you guys can
see this on screen there's like like on
a camera sometimes where I'm going to
use totally the wrong term I'm sorry
Brandon if you can hear this but on a
camera sometimes there's like those
things that can mow pass the lens to
block certain light out from getting in
the lens that you don't want and it's
kind of like the same deal but for the
monitor there's a hood on the top and
there's to syphon sort of like horse
blinders yeah so if you're not in like a
optimum environment and you have glare
or whatever else you're like this is an
HD monitor with a whole bunch of
individually control the lighting zones
it needs a lot of car parts you know if
you want to think that much money into
it and I can actually understand
attitude and speaking of which no
pricing or release information on this
yet but hopefully soon I'm really
interested in the hood
I want to get it in here and try to see
if it actually really does you're really
anything the hood Luke yeah you know I
get that impression for me just all the
time
ya know I'm super curate your desk super
gangster super yeah anyways I was pretty
cool it's fun to see a searching more in
the monitor segment wow someone just
made a big change to the doc thanks
Oh what is happening oh just to the
table of contents okay so this is very
much more you not very much more but the
FCC announced this plan to reverse title
to net neutrality I know most of what
those words mean
and that's about it you know what Title
V means no okay so here's what's going
on so the FCC has tabled a proposal to
undo the 2015 rules that implement a net
neutrality with a toggle to
classification now here's what this
means
so before 2016 net neutrality was it had
been implemented there are rules at the
sec a path to say okay here are some
things that your ISP cannot do again the
big thing for net neutrality advocates
was you couldn't have any sort of
unreasonable also what I'm looking for
there no one reasonable discrimination
with network crap okay yeah yeah so so
that rule is already in place prior to
2015 in 2015 they decided to the best
word a user will be strengthened it I
guess that depends your point of view
but they decide to strengthen it by by
classifying ISPs and Internet services
under title 2 of the Communications Act
of 1934 and what this means is they'll
be regulated as what's called a common
carrier and when you do this what ends
up happening is the the regulations are
a little bit more strict it has to like
what they could do it now I you may have
caught the fact I said the
Communications Act of 1934 it was
actually enacted a long time ago and it
was originally sorry I just let me do my
laptop here that's very distracting
there we go
okay um it was originally designed to
regulate landline telephone carriers all
the way baker it
amended in 1996 and so now we have we
have the legal framework that we have
today so can you think because like from
a Canadian point of view here this came
into our whatever and we shot it down
like almost immediately so I don't even
know a ton about it but the Americans
have gone through this a number of times
before have they not this is maybe like
this is the third major action I can say
yeah because I've talked about done when
show so yeah like 2013 yeah exactly
what's going on why isn't this
permanently blocked out that's one thing
that I super don't get okay so then shot
down every time is it not what do you
mean
Oh like you weakening net neutrality as
Michelle and every time was that yeah or
okay so it's a little bit complicated so
back in I believe it was 2010 that maybe
they first started to promulgate net
neutrality rules the sec so if they
first did it under a piece of
legislation called called section 706 so
section 5 section 706 of the 1996
Communications Act and the SEC said okay
there is something in Section 706 that
allows us to say here's what your ISDN
can't do it can't unreasonably
discriminate between different forms of
traffic right so in 2015 that's what
they decided to bring in title 2 which
is theoretically stronger and now do you
want the world roll back and kind of go
back to the way it was before 2015 okay
so the concern here is so there's two
sides to this the telecommunications
industry is saying even if you want net
neutrality you don't want to under title
2 because the way toggle 2 works is the
SEC can just kind of sit there and they
can pick and choose what things in it
are applicable to broadband because not
everything is going to be because like I
said this is an extremely old law that
we have which design for telephone
access so they can pick and choose
what's going to apply it to broadband um
the telecommunications industry for
reasons I hope are obvious does not like
this because they could at some point
they could legally do more onerous
things like rate regulation and actually
tell Comcast or spectrum or whoever else
you must charge this amount for internet
service we obviously don't want that the
other sizes is saying that well if you
go back to regulating under Section 706
it's going to be very weak actually have
the text of 706 right here in front of
me oh my goodness and it's actually not
very much but it says that the
Commission with regulatory jurisdiction
blabbity blah shall encourage the
deployment on a reasonable and timely
basis of advanced telecommunications
capability to all Americans in a manner
consistent with the public interest
convenience and necessity price
regulation regulatory forbearance
measures that promote competition in the
local telecommunications market and/or
other regulating methods that remove
barriers to infrastructure investment
okay if you can adjust that for a second
it's all kind of vague there's nothing
in there that says thou shalt not
discriminate against different kinds of
traffic okay so the the argument from
people who are more concerned about net
neutrality is that oh this is very
wishy-washy and even that lasted or
other regulating methods that remove
barriers to infrastructure investment so
the head of the FCC who is Pro scrapping
the title two things um people are
worried that this said people worried
about the bit about infrastructure
investment because he made a speech a
couple days ago about this and he said
Oh ever since they did this title 2
thing where they put stricter
regulations on ISPs there has been less
money spent on infrastructure investment
which is a bad thing because you have
less you you're investing less in
quality services but that's a very easy
way for ya them to manipulate that
because they know that one of the things
that this is looking for there's some be
like oh we don't like this law no more
investment direct yeah it's an easy
thing for them to do and you know
there's there's some other there's some
other things in his speech I found a
little bit eyebrow-raising um one of
them was he was saying that oh people
keep talking about like you know fast
lanes for certain kind of traffic and
they're afraid that's happening and he
was over here claiming that hasn't
happened but it already kind of has I
think it was a couple of years ago
Netflix was forced to pony up a bunch of
money on Comcast because it was a calm
cat
I don't never like it was one of the
major ISPs I think it was Comcast but
they end up throttling Netflix's speeds
which for something like streaming HD
video is super important so that
actually kind of has already happened he
didn't mention anything to speech about
net neutrality which was also a little
bit concerning so there's two sides to
this but basically the crux of the
argument is which law is this going to
be is net neutrality going to be
accomplished under one is trickier than
the other so someone has asked a
question shouldn't the FTC be the ones
governing net neutrality instead of the
FCC so that's a difficult question to
answer just for a little bit of
background the FTC is the Federal Trade
Commission they have usually been the
federal agency in the u.s. to regulate
things like consumer protection and also
privacy so the argument for the people
who are on the sort of the chairman of
the FCC there on his side that want to
scrap these rules and kind of go back to
the way things were prior to 2015
they're saying okay the FTC has been in
charge of consumer protection and
consumer privacy for a very long time
why do we want to take to take this out
of their hands now and put it into the
hands of the FCC which the argument is
more ill-equipped to deal with privacy
issues and consumer protection issues
now whether you buy that or not is a
completely separate argument but there's
you know the question kind of comes down
to what's the interworking of each
agency like and I don't think I'm really
qualified to speak on that but okay yeah
well if you live in the States and you
care about your internet follow up with
the stuff John said there was a lot in a
short time period but it who fired
through it I'm cool with it it's it's
it's kind of a complicated issue because
you're getting down into the weeds of
what the text of the wall actually says
yeah yeah but yeah that's that's not
that's not a thing for me I don't want
to tell you what to do I don't use the
internet down there so yeah follow it up
on your own I think that would be if I
was down there and this was happening I
would be very interested in I'll be
reading up on it because I started to
worry about it when it became a thing up
here but then I was shot down like
immediately okay like I'm better I'm
sure like the way you're the framework
of how your communications are regulated
in Canada is probably very different to
what we have in the US so I don't know
but yeah that would make sense anyways
moving on to
a new topic Amazon Alex I'm just going
to call it Alex because I don't want to
trigger it but there's an a at the end
of this so it's Alex with an A yeah
Alex with an A Amazon's Alex with an A
learns to talk like a human the reason
why we're talking like that and not
saying the full name by the way is we
just don't want to trigger anyone's
version of this thing at their home to
start searching for stuff and that has
happened before so so yeah Alex with an
A is going to be better it will be able
to do things like whisper take a breath
to pause for emphasis adjust the rate
pitch and volume of her speech and more
she'll even be able to bleep out swear
words which is pretty that's kind of
interesting especially because she's
gonna sound more human mm-hmm be like
man what the bleep doesn't sound like
something very human-like most people
don't believe out their own sentences
you know what I mean but I guess maybe
if it sounds like a recording of a human
then it would be fine I don't know I
kind of wish we could I think swear
words are actually funnier when they're
bullies just start saying bleep instead
of a swear word well no like if you
watch if you watch any kind of TV show
or something that's bleeped out I think
it actually adds a little bit of comic
effect make them crazy the sharpness of
the tone yeah the new tools are being
provided to third-party app developers
allowing them to control pronunciation
imitation timing Anto nation wow I just
read that super terribly timing and
emotion it's pretty cool I think that's
awesome because the more natural these
things are paired with hopefully the
back end getting a little bit better
it's going to be very awesome for voice
assisted support my main thing that I'm
excited for is locally based voice
assisted support where not everything
that I say has to go into some
permanently logged box somewhere that I
don't have access yeah all that Wonder F
for fat chance yeah I know yeah
I'm just hoping that eventually some
tertiary like these things get so good
yeah some point it's so easy to do this
stuff that some side company just makes
one that you can buy I mean that would I
think there would be I'll be way more
down there would be like I think
a big segment of the market that would
be interested in something like that
yeah so like like a personal Jarvis I
had this idea a really long time ago
where I wanted to string all these mics
throughout my house and have all of them
at the same time permanently recording
onto this giant notepad that was going
to automatically delete chunks above and
rewrite now it's going to stuff and I'll
have dragons speaking permanently
running so that it tried to like dictate
everything that was said within my house
under this notepad and then I was gonna
have another program watching the
notepad and making actions based on what
was there and then I was like now what
would be the ultimate point of something
like that my own Jarvis but I know I'm
not nearly good enough I see that's what
the problem is me yeah it does not last
that you kind of lost me there because
it to me it almost sound like you just
want to transcribe your own speech no no
cuz there's another bought watching the
dog I like words that might show up so
if I said like Jarvis or whatever else
it would then pay proper attention to
the next few words that come up and then
it would like do whatever I needed to do
yeah I'm just not I'm not if only you
had a massive team of coders handy and
like a massive like machine learning
apparatus yeah I'm working on getting a
massive team of coders ready so far I
have not enough but the ones that I have
are awesome because we're doing good
things boiler boilers been learning
front end really yeah it's been great I
just I would rather he was able to work
on the stuff that he's particularly very
good at it's good that he's learning
everything hi boiler but yeah I need
more support for him I'm working on it
Elon Musk
at Ted Vancouver was teasing a Tesla
electric semi-truck up to four new
gigafactory locations as well which is
pretty freakin cool
I this guy is going to take over the
world there was a picture of SpaceX and
they had like one of the rocket fuselage
if you floss at the rock yeah main body
had one of the one of the fuselage of
the Rockets they had the giant boring
machine and they had like one other
thing and it was like what does it even
have
yeah so awesome anyways Elon Musk on
stage at 2017 TED conference in
Vancouver today he showed a shadowy
image which I will hopefully have I do
not have a source for you a smooth
continuous trend sign yeah way to go
James a smooth continuous design between
the windshield and the upper facade so
that it would be very I don't know how
else to describe that I think it will
look very futuristic yeah can you try to
find a picture I will think um Elon Musk
electric semi musk also said that there
were likely before like I just said new
Giga factory sites announced this year
but none quite yet the company said in
its most recent earnings report that it
has to finalize locations for up to
three new Giga factory sites this year
in addition to the existing Nevada
location it's just a teaser image but it
looks kinda cool but it looks like a
semi truck well the headlights are very
Tesla like is that absolutely one that
was shown on the stream that's what it
looks like yeah
based on the caption here give me one
quick second rip this on screen yeah
there you go just need those cool right
there
can I blow this up a little bit maybe a
new tab there we go so it's kind of hard
to tell but yeah you can see there's a
seam there where the windshield hits the
top but it's not like a major difference
I don't know you know it looks like a
semi-truck I'm excited for it but it are
you
it looks like it's are you are you
planning to get your CDL and become a
truck driver Luke yeah yes I'm going to
bend a floatplane Club I'm going to ban
in lines Media Group I'm just going to
drive a truck which is going to be
automated in a few years anyways I just
I hate having a job I just want to go
down a career where it will take my job
away you know there's there just to be
hanging your job and hating having a job
because I think most people the second
thing is probably true I don't hate
having this job I didn't say
particularly I would I would refer to
come to work every day because I'm a
weird person I'm talking about like
I prefer to come to work late every day
oh I'm talking about worrying about like
living in a box what I mean oh not you
know not the you know doing a certain
thing minor complications yeah no big
deal yeah
also there's apparently a UK iron man
who demonstrated a flying suit I'm going
to have to see this one he's a British
inventor apparently he flew it at the
TED conference in Vancouver which is
pretty sick you can see him right here
this is his suit you can see him there
as well how far off the ground he get
that's what I would like to know uh he
doesn't look like he's that far off the
ground but it looks like he's got some
type of propulsion on his legs kind of
like Star Wars rocket boots video that's
a short man he's got some on his hands
which is actually pretty cool yeah yeah
I guess it's more of a proof of concept
than anything like I can hover above the
ground yeah so this is possible look at
me Mom the suit can fly uninterrupted
for around ten minutes that's actually
pretty good considering how slimline the
suit is it doesn't seem that big anima
it's it's a decent size but doesn't seem
way too big I mean that's not bad
considering how long was the Wright
brothers first flight how long that
lasts for like 15 seconds or something
though I mean tennis is looking pretty
good next to that there he goes
so that's pretty sick whoa bunch of
power on there I wonder how hard that is
to control he's doing pretty good looks
like he is just keeping it steady just
using his arms alone like there's no
because I was thinking like on this wall
this one in other mock-up models like
the one right below it you can see the
rockets on his feet oh yeah this one it
just seems like he has him on his arms
and possibly his back oh there we go
there's something on his back as well
yeah yeah but he doesn't have the feet
ones on so I guess there's a few
different iterations that's pretty cool
though
that is pretty cool I won't want to
though here's a different one you can
move around pretty quick I just like the
idea of like super extended jumps like
jump assist that's in a few different
games or like you gotta jump something
and you like blast this
thing and it gives you a little bit more
distance in height that would be super
cool in my opinion
you shall think of the possibilities
with something like this band glide to
work you make a slimline version of this
that you can wear that just kind of
looks like a normal backpack and maybe
the wrist and leg things aren't like way
too big but they're like nicely
integrated I would be super down
tella me too that would be so cool you
know like if that something like I ever
does hit the market like what the early
adopter tax is gonna be on it oh yeah
but like like you can flow Casey nice
that video comes out he's riding on a
boosted board and then there's like a
big gap and he just like hops up and
floats over it damn all while filming
somehow he'll make it work 80 trillion
views eight defect billions of uses all
of you oh man there you go
I thought it was pretty sick there's
also okay so you said you had something
to say about this please to scan soccer
fans faces yes so this is going to be at
this year's UEFA Champions League final
in in Cardiff in Wales so there's gonna
be cameras around the stadium and also
with the main train station in Cardiff
and so the expected attendance is this
says 170,000 I don't think Millennium
Stadium and cards can hold 170,000
people I think I think it was process to
be 70,000 let me see when if you will
this real quick Millennium Stadium
cartas let's find out capacity 75,000
okay so I think I think that that was
supposed to be a little bit north of 70
K they're gonna compare it against a
police database of 500,000 people of n
people of interest so if there's if
there's a match police will get a heads
up that could help them stop a terrorist
or frequent hooligan now in requisite
here's the thing so in European soccer
there are if you get banned from like
one Stadium for doing something
particularly bad you can get banned from
a lot of them and hooliganism isn't is
bad there as it used to be but if you
ever watch soccer English soccer
European soccer you can still see some
of the legacies of the hooligan era back
in the nineteen eighties like they still
have crowd segregation at all the
Premier League games so if you watch a
Premier League game it's not like in the
US or Canada where if you are a fan of
the visiting team just get
gets it wherever you want to cheer for
your team and hope nothing bad happens
like that guided through the canopy um
yes that was okay uh I was a jerk
different story but um but in but in
Britain you will see so there will be a
specific section in every stadium for
visiting supporters and what will often
happen is you'll see stewards basically
like stadium workers in like really
bright dayglo jackets standing all
around the perimeter of where the
opposing supporters are just to prevent
any fights or any sort of other unseemly
behavior so oh so so yeah there's
there's all these legacies of the
hooligan era that you can still see in
European soccer so is so obviously when
one person does something bad at one
place if it's bad enough they'll just
say okay you're banned from every soccer
venue in Europe for six months a year or
five years for life depending on how bad
is so I'm guessing this is why they want
to do that um so the fine doesn't it
sound a little preemptive um yes and no
some of the instances over there have
been pretty bad I mean if you look at
who's playing maybe um it's going to be
one of reales rid and athletically
Madrid versus one of Juventus in Monaco
so it's probably not gonna be a huge
rivalry in the final but even so every
big Club has a few people that are going
to come and they only try to call us
trouble just because they can so but
there obviously is a concern here it
says South Wales police will have to
honor the country's usage guidelines
only harvesting as much information as
they really need and being transparent
with the data they collect but there has
already been evidence of police forces
both in the UK and abroad preserving
face recognition data for innocent
people so how are they using that data
yeah yeah and like like the frequent
hooligans thing I get it but if you like
if you screw around a bunch and then you
like kay I'm going to not be a jerk
anymore mmm-hmm are you going to get
blamed if something bad happens if a
ride happens in your area and you're
just trying to flee that area cuz you're
like I'm not about that life anymore
yeah like are you going to get screwed
anyways because you got picked up by a
facial scan oh man that's a good
question like that I mean cuz a lot of a
lot of places do keep known hooligan
databases so that is known who that is
actual
be a thing but as far as way I don't
know like that's a good that I guess
that would be I guess that would be a
little bit of a risk but you know if
they all captured on camera maybe that
was on a right YouTube so who knows ah
yeah I guess we'll see
yeah no way to tell for now I don't like
it I don't like the pre-emptive stuff
I'm trying to think of any of those four
clubs have like a large and active
hooligan firm but then again you know
you also have to worry about individual
people just having too much to drink and
causing problems too right
yeah that's a good call now are you I
know you're a Nintendo fan in terms of
Mario Kart are you a Nintendo fan for
their mobile stuff um what specifically
like 3ds 2ds oh yeah I have a 3ds I have
a number of games for it so so what do
you think about this they have a new 2d
excel I'm going to throw the video up
here and mute it but essentially it's a
3ds XL without 2d capability as far as I
can't really tell for $80 no no no no
like a sensor like no 150 US dollars
wait where does it say oh oh oh I'm
sorry that was for the original 2d yes
oh yeah well okay i think the price is a
little bit steep for what it is but as
far as just you know that aside just
looking at the concept i think this is a
really really good idea um the 3d on the
3ds I mean it's pretty okay for one but
it's not it's not for everybody like my
wife has a 3ds as well never uses a 3d
feature I use I use it on mine but if
it's for if a one day just broke and I
can never use it again I wouldn't miss
it very much and what do you use it for
for everything I try to turn it on when
I can because it's a feature which I
paid for so I might as well try to use
it get some kind of enjoyment okay but
it's what if you have the option to buy
one or the other and ones like how much
is it 3dsxl in this case you know um I
think they're a little bit cheaper these
three is closer to 200 so I think you're
I think you're saving about 40 or 50
dollars with this thing okay yes yeah
because in Canada I think these are like
about 200 bucks and I think the that
original unibody design was what turned
a lot of people away from the original
2d yes because it just it wasn't rest
portable was very attractive it's a very
dirt
a bowl system yes I've had a to D s in
the past I traded it in got a 3d s echo
eventually but very durable system but
yet it's not very wheeled Li now I'm
going to do a straw poll I'm interested
for the Nintendo people out there
do you like the 3d option on your 3ds so
yes no one then different yes and this
was specifically for Nintendo people out
there don't press indifferent if you
don't own one and you don't care only
pressing different if you do own one and
you're like yeah I turn it on sometimes
but it's not amazing I don't know now
we're going to get a bunch of in
different spam from the PS Vita throw I
don't know yeah yeah absolutely
we'll come back to that later cool but
yeah it's it's a little bit different it
can play 3ds games but without the 3d
effect make also play normal DS games
the main saying is unlike the 2d s
instead of being flat it does fold now
which is very good I think it needs to
be much cheaper apparently it still
packs the same powers the 3ds XL there
there they're claiming yes they're
claiming that this addition to be
handheld market
demonstrates their commitment to the
handheld market so yep that's cool again
it's 150 US dollars it launches in
Australia and New Zealand on June 15th
and in the US on July 28th is this
what's going to just cannibalize part of
the market for this thing this is why
I'm saying you speech I think okay I
think a little bit yeah but this is
something I've talked to other people
about the switch is kind of delicate
yeah
and it can't like fold and it's pretty
big like you can't just fit it in your
pocket and if you get like the case for
it so you're actually protecting it
properly it's like pretty freaking big
it's going to get like a backpack we
can't fit three es XL in your pocket a
standard I guess yeah what I can in all
of my pants and all of my shorts okay
get rekt
okay but it's a big pocket it's still
red Luke has large pockets he he thinks
it's very important that you know not
full of money they're empty in that
regard listen but they can fit a 3's
exhale which is pretty cool I think it
needs to be closer to a hundred bucks
still I really think ya achiever I think
like okay can you look up how much a
3dsxl costs sure and us I always gets I
think it's 190 I'll look on Amazon I'm
going to check on the straw poll real
quick you do that three D s exhale no
not three s XL 3 D s there we go so 51%
of people said no oh goodness 29% of
people said indifference and only 20% of
people said yes you know what on Amazon
you don't like closer to 250 which I
don't think is right maybe it's like
they're like really expensive and can
you know what let me check I'm checking
the US but let me check Walmart like I
just want to go to Walmart and buy a 3 s
XL like how much would that be
enter come on to 5th also closer to 250
I could have sworn they were cheaper
than that I don't think so man I got
mindful of 200 I do remember that
probably like a sale or something like
Walmart does really aggressive sales on
the inherent in the holiday season yeah
so so right now the closer to 250 I
still think they should be a little bit
cheaper because if you're saying the
original 2d s is big dropped to 80 bucks
you're paying almost twice that so you
can get with the fold
I think the 2d s didn't sell very well I
bet you they're dropping in to 80 bucks
to try to kind of get rid of it cuz like
I I I don't think I've ever seen one in
the wild nah I wasn't like my brothers I
think I saw a small child on a 2d s one
time somewhere and that was it so they
are pretty dang durable though that's
the thing like if you got like again a
3ds or a 2d s XL or a normal 2d eff are
far more durable than that's which they
just are solutely now the switch has
Zelda but still anyways sports your spot
time oh here we go we have to put our
glasses lounge's here we go there we go
these are pretty cool these are called
spectrum glasses
they say staring at a monitor all day
can be hard on your eyes over time and
make it tougher to fall asleep that's
why things are certain like applications
that you can put on your desktop that
will like change the color of your
screen exist yeah and it said reduce the
blue light yeah yeah but then those are
kind of annoying because if you need to
see like the true color of something
just being able to do that is pretty
cool instead of something I think it's
called FLIR no no that's a camera spi
block yeah F dot Lux it's it actually
like changed the color screen which I'm
not personally a fan of now I have not
been wearing these a ton lately but they
seem comfortable to me but we have
someone in office who has been wearing
them almost since he got hired and he
likes it a lot James oh yeah James has
been wearing them if he hears this and
wants to come down here and be a model
for the glasses that would be fantastic
they look good we have a whole bunch of
different models I like these ones
John utilize one of a gray charcoal
they're good oh is it
yeah there's another pair that don't
look particularly that great on me but
they look really good on Dennis they're
these Early's I don't think they look
for those like the Burberry style ones I
believe so yeah yeah yeah and what I
actually do like these affair of it
because like if you have a smartphone
which of course faster if you do if you
get like an app that says it reduces
blue lights sometimes if that could be
too aggressive and everything has like
this really those have already went
through these the computer screens and
things they still look very naturally
normal there's obviously a difference
but if you put the glasses on it doesn't
look like the colors super offer
untoward it looks very natural just
slightly less blue what one of the big
things that James said he's one of the
writers here so he spends a lot of time
staring at like Word docs and
spreadsheets all day so with that much
bright light he said that it's helped a
lot which is cool that's good they they
feel nice they come with a one-year
warranty they say their product is
extremely durable the low color
distortion they block high-energy blue
light that's the whole point but they do
try to keep tellers as similar as
possible that's something we just talked
about it doesn't actually seem to change
that much which is cool if you're
interested
go to spectrum glasses comm slash
collection slash products the link will
be below on youtube and use offer code
Linus to save 10% off and this is
actually a Vancouver startup so they're
local for us yeah and I think it's cool
that James has actually been using them
it says James has been wearing these
non-stop for weeks weeks as and I think
above for like I think it's been quite a
while and like some a lot apparently he
started wearing them so close to his
actual start date of working here that
people thought that they were just his
normal glasses oh yeah so that's why I
didn't know who was wearing them because
I thought he just wore glasses yeah yeah
so those are those are his glasses a
little bit there they like actually kind
of blend in you would think they were
just normal glasses but no they have
technology our other sponsor today oh I
did that whole thing without doing this
there's the link that you guys oh we're
going to put the glasses back on if you
want these go go fill here go there we
go there we are
yeah use offer code line at save 10% off
again they filter out blue light from
your monitor that's like the most
aggressive intense light that you can
have moving on we have cooler master
with their master keys Pro line of
keyboards that's not in there don't take
it out I have the one with the keyboard
in it haha anyways
master keys Pro keyboards come in
different sizes I have the medium John
has the a large oh my they complete the
Kula master keyboard portfolio which is
cool
it can be simple because you just pick
your switch color so this one is a blue
is that one also a blue that one is also
a blue carry glue these were probably
picked for me blues my favorite color
although it does annoy people on my
stream that's fine you like blues -
what's your favorite color
my favorite color my favorite color
switch switch I'm a difficult question
I like greens green I'm a green guy I
like I like my greens rare uncommon yes
the master keys Pro white M&amp;amp;L have LED
backlighting which is cool if you're
into a more brighter clean white
keyboard that could be for you it
utilizes the
from cortex m3 processor on its on the
fly system which is pretty cool it has
lighting modes macro recording and a
combined with four profile keys which
are somewhere they have ease view
software they've combined and key and
six key rollover together which is cool
so it's ideal for both work and play
because it's a keyboard so you can WASD
on it and you can home row which is cool
that's totally up to you check them out
at the links below
that's cool grass TOCOM slash products
lash line flash keyboards yeah cool cool
or check out the length of your
description on YouTube and there we go
I'll take a pic whoa oh no Elena you hit
the thing in front of it not it I'm
gonna put these back on actually yeah
they're pretty good you're pretty good
I liked them you know I don't know if
they look like great on me but I like
let's get this out here Dennis can come
out her genital yes Dennis yes dad asked
can you hear that I can hang out some
cool yeah oh there we go Arius Barry is
put these on expand it frankly you have
to be our model wait you okay so this my
glasses
no there's regular glasses yeah let's
see do I look different not very you
know I think they look good they look so
natural I can't I can't you know
hahaha I like this actually I actually
like you here one second put them back
on hold on hold on
you
okay okay your other glasses on Oh Oh
these one a little bit bigger
yeah but what do they do they filter up
blue light so look at the screen and
then put the glasses on see how that
works
yes yeah yeah yeah so it's also your
less harsh on your eyes you can fall
asleep easier afterwards all I kinda
stuff I'm a ghastly
Edward you got where it is way easier to
fall sleep I want to put you yeah
they're not sleeping pills so just dust
it but it'll make it less harsh so
you're not forced to kind of stay up
anyway it's back to normal
content MD puts two GPUs and 32 gigs of
RAM on a Radeon Pro duo graphics card so
Brandon saw this down at NAB but decided
not to Wow this is the ARS technica show
apparently we have so many ARS technica
news articles today which is cool I like
those guys but yeah Brandon saw this
down at NAB but they weren't showing
really good demo said so it was hard to
yeah I actually really liked it yeah
yeah wait actually yeah cuz it filters
out blue lights yeah but it's still
little solid this is the mother longest
ads Paul Whiteman yo I'm not even
looking at twitch capital up here
Michael yeah probably sorry that isn't
even I was just interested um yeah the
card combines two players GPUs for $1000
and it launches in May this is not
targeted as a gaming card no at all they
launched it at a like camera and film
show they didn't even announce it to us
at all like it's it's not a gaming card
but it is super cool regardless and you
get it what appears to be the Team
Rocket logo all the things that's like
almost exactly the same
I really like the blue I really like
position of these power connectors
especially with the types of systems
that it's probably going to go in yeah
and the fact that you might have a bunch
of them in a row if you're going to do
something like that yeah that's going to
make it much easier if you have tight
gaps between your between your graphics
cards absolutely yeah AMD claims 11.45
teraflops of performance compare
2:16 for the older Radeon Pro but one
that is also substantially cheaper
cooler and less power-hungry and you get
dramatically more RAM 32 gigs that's
crazy
just think of how much stuff you could
hold your frame buffer for a few gigs of
RAM you will never be walking for a
large green buffer all whole game yeah
let me just render this entire game
first every possible scenario no that's
obviously way too much but still I don't
know I think that's pretty cool it's not
it's not like it's not for us suffer
game which you can overhear Oh every
time yeah I even work on my chair
positioning you know most people
probably actually maybe there could be a
ton of h3 fans in the audience have you
ever watched the h3 show when he was
like oh it's and she's like this is even
a love the screen you know she like goes
out on her own
oh I feel like whoever sits on this side
because that normally happens to me and
line is annoying me or something every
so gently like I don't know I don't know
I think it's because you have to end up
sitting like way on this out of the
table yeah everyone wants a naturally
colorful alright we're yeah I'm a today
there's something in that yes yeah
anyways moving on let's see what else we
have the shows technically been over for
13 minutes but I want to look at this
one too fallout is bringing
post-apocalyptic warfare to your
tabletop actually not an ARS technica
relation over 50 knows what no like like
it's it's an all like twitch page just
died I wanted to post the link in the
chat come back to it no okay it's fine
this is um I need to vote it's full to
be about an hour long oh well we still
have we still have fifteen minutes then
because we started the 4:30 2000 my
goodness I was starting at 4:00 for some
reason that was weird
anyways fallout 4 miniatures game goes
on sale this November don't worry about
it it's cool at 7 fine apparently it was
possibly going to crowdfunding but it is
not I'm not entirely sure if that's true
it just says it'll skip crowdfunding
mm-hm
I don't know anyways some of the
miniatures are detailed down here which
look
pretty cool oh you guys can't see
anything so you like painted yourself
finishers again yeah so people other
than me might be good at it which would
be pretty cool
if I got into a miniatures game I would
definitely have to fund someone else to
paint my miniatures or I'd just be all
grey all the time one of the two what if
you like a 3d action skin ways like 3d
print is like a color scheme directly on
to it would I even work if you got like
you got some filament that took a little
bit longer to try and you could just
like sort of so paint with PLAs melted
plastic if you could get get a nozzle or
like a thing that had like fine enough
control or something I don't know but
then I'm doing art it's still me doing
art what bad but at least you will have
to worry about like holding your hands
super steady you know yeah I would still
really really really suck at it but
there's some of the monster enemies
which are pretty cool I'm just like and
blows up oh it's all transparent stuff
good job polygons it looks it looks neat
it looks cool
I'd be interested to see someone
actually play it because I'm not a huge
miniatures person myself I'm really into
these Star Wars edge of the Empire
role-playing game that's super fun and
I'm really into like other tabletop
games but I've never gotten into a
miniatures game we had Tyler on the show
to talk about this yeah the main reason
why I haven't is because the the cost
scares the everliving crap oh yeah this
things are so expensive
my goodness we started playing what is
the name of that football game we stole
a little blood bowl we started playing
Blood Bowl we still haven't done the
finals
it's Anthony versus me for the finals we
just haven't done it and the trophy
looks like a Lombardi Trophy except the
football has spikes on it it is golda so
yeah let's see here more topics
Microsoft is completing their Windows
Phone wind down by June ok this is just
this isn't even a tech topic it's just
hilarious a Russian spy ship was sunk by
a sheep barge so I don't I don't know I
don't even really
the circumstances just seems so random
because it was a togolese ship it was a
ship with the Togo flag carrying sheet
between Jordan and Romania yeah it's the
most random thing and and a Russian ship
hit it and the Russian ship sunk yeah
despite a Russian spy ship so the
Russian ship was built in 1970 and was
converted into an intelligence
collection vessel in 1989 that's it
right there I guess yep oh there's the
barge so that's a pretty big okay it was
the win when you're reading the
description for it the barge sounds like
a raft it does it sounds like that my
name is ginormous ounds like a pile of
wood they just post machine yeah yeah
hold you'll float yeah okay that's a
pretty intense that's not like some
random raft with it no it's not this is
like a shepherd this is like inertia in
action like yeah yeah so just got super
wrecked that's far less interesting than
I thought it was anyway moving off oh my
good okay oh we do have other topic we
do have other topics um the Windows
Phone wind-down AMD AMD this topic was
posted by Z Mule on the forum we're
gonna jump over on the forum real quick
make sure I'm not logged in that's good
AMD making money from ad revenue from
installing drivers so apparently when
you install one of their new drivers
yeah so Terry Mac Adan hopefully I'm
saying that right says that some of you
didn't like game icons installed so we
updated the Radeon software package
without one we heard you sorry so
without having an option for it it just
linked game icons onto your desktop
which were shortcuts with monetized
tagged links to go get the game I guess
and I don't think of a demographic that
has less tolerance for bloatware than
people who were really into PC gaming
I'm amazed that like yeah
yeah it was even a bitly tracking link
so they weren't even like trying to hide
that it was happening it wasn't a direct
link to the official page like I said it
was a bitly dragging like it had a
referral ID included in the final URL
destination ah first first they draw the
capsaicin molecule the wrong way now
this okay do you want to explain that a
little bit oh okay you put me on the
spot for it so I believe in you
so the capsaicin thing it was like what
they were calling some of their events
surrounding their new Radeon stuff right
up because capsaicin capsaicin is the
chemical that makes hot peppers hot and
hot peppers what color do you think of
red like AMD Radeon so capsaicin but so
they had like a whole branding package
up for this keep little logo up actually
I could just uh yes you need a second
greatly just type capsaicin and cream
and you'll find it um Luke is going to
pull up the logo of this thing here so
image search would probably help you
there you go I'm working okay there we
go okay so going to pull it up
very good so that's them that is
purportedly the molecular structure of
capsaicin except there's a huge problem
here um that would have to draw with
your mouth here yes this ring over here
this ring this sort of six corner
detects agon here so the thing about
capsaicin is this ring is actually
aromatic which means you have you should
have a double bond here a double bond
here and a double bond here and there I
have a real double bonds what would be
out what's actually happening is the
electrons or was going whe like that
like all around these six because these
are all carbon atoms each each corner is
a carbon atom right so they neglected to
put in the double bonds or the
aromaticity in this and so the molecule
is actually not capsaicin it's something
completely different I don't know what
is but it's not capsaicin it's not the
same stuff that actually makes your hot
peppers hot and they went to the trouble
of saying oh we're going to use this
organic chemistry model in our branding
so if you do that you should really do
it correctly I mean this is a field
where like if you know anything about
like pharmaceuticals for example where
if you have one molecule if you take it
and you make it a mirror
image a change as small as that can
completely change what it does inside
your body so this is not correct and it
bothers I so first this and now they're
putting bloatware in with with their
drivers just what next damned II don't
what next just open your ice-cream
machines off past two am i modern
chemistry in college that's why I know
yeah just do just to explain yeah okay
probably last because we're just running
out of add topics to be completely
honest add topics show topics there is a
3d printer with tank treads which is
just Twitter on low well here in a
second add topics I was thinking about
the AMD ad tank okay I'm just going to
post this in twitch chat what didn't you
mine or anything all access to it chat
well I'm modern in chemistry and
political science so everything that
aren't those two things oh there we go
okay what's happening mi t--'s mobile 3d
printer built the largest structure to
date so you can kind of see it there
here we go there's a video which I will
mute so it's spraying out like a lot of
stuff at a time and it's sort of foaming
up a little bit looks like cool hwhip
cool quiz so that is a 3d printer that
is driving around in order to lay it I
guess I don't know if you can call it
film it to lay its stuff I don't know
what it starts as excretions yeah there
you go look at it go looks like a big
pot like a pot that is super cool is
cool I feel like the military would be
super stoked with something like this oh
like if you could like quickly have some
sort of like shelter or four yeah yeah
like ideal definitely seriously doubt
whatever it just printed is like a
defensible structure but if you could
just throw up something that people
could shelter in yeah exactly you know
this could be useful like or for like I
don't know disaster relief or something
you can eat a bunch of temporary shelter
yeah yeah I don't know I don't know um
it'll think that it's pretty sick it
looks like a very it's like
Universal constructor from Deus Ex
except much more rudimentary but still
very very cool because we don't live in
a fictional universe but a Mikey that is
a wild I want to see that gif again of
it whoop
ok here we go so it was Caltech on that
is a lightly better one just to one that
they Mikey feel like that might happen
MIT or Caltech go I have to choose one
yep um no basis for comparison though I
used to live in Boston and I kind of
wanted to go to MIT when I was a kid so
I might be I guess there you go your
host done there you go
a clear and definitive decision MIT is
better in the Caltech I didn't say that
if you're watching this from Caltech I
did not say that
apparently antivirus software from
Webroot nukes the customers machine I
need to dive into this a little bit more
going to post this in the chat what is
that picture it is an eye filled I come
home that's melted a little bit cool
good good
again it's the the Ars Technica show so
we keep going with Ars Technica news
what's the scoop okay get it understand
where the ice cream cone thing came in
okay on this false positive issue that
has crippled a quarter of my customers
Wow brutal it's pretty bad
apparently Webroot just wrecked some
stuff I haven't used any either solver
in a very very long time yeah what are
you defender um yeah just whatever comes
with Windows because I'm careful about
like my browsing habits so so many
people these days just on defender
they're like defender and then every
once in a while download the free trial
sweep of malwarebytes yeah that's like
like like sometimes you might need
something specialized to get things off
if you already have a problem but like
you know it's reformat every once in a
while use defender and be careful about
where else apparently Webroot was
flagging Facebook as a phishing site
nice that's possibly accurate
what is a phishing site soaring a
signature update that it had just nuked
hundreds of benign files that were
needed to run Microsoft Windows as well
as apps that run on top of the operating
system
the and it flagged Facebook as a
phishing site where's the perfect does
elite system32 meet yeah like that would
be appropriate right here you know what
the most secure computer is one that
can't run yeah I was just want to build
doesn't funko both secure computer and
abacus yeah I think Colton doesn't know
what that is I think I know
do you know Navitus if you're the
geoguessr video I said overclocking
abacus and Colton was like what's that
it's a little thing that you have beads
are for the beads around for its no no
no doc crap you said strawpoll after I
storm explanation this is not my fault
do you know or did did you know what and
how because to watch one I know what a
JPEG is 1b yes
tisk tisk okay let's see this is gonna
be the last thing on the show I want to
see how old I am
that's what this poll is all about
modern kids not know what a vac I are
maybe no maybe okay a Bacchae well it
sounds like Latin and applause Wes is I
yeah so I'm I could be just completely
making it up but you know what let's
love searchable school wood
oh thank goodness I'm not - okay that is
the thing we all know the abacus plural
Abuk i or advocacy's whichever you'd
like abacuses I think advocate on sex
advertiser having those abaca there any
to crunch some numbers that sounds like
a really cool name of a protagonist
addict I advocate it sounds almost
biblical
like addict I in the quest for truth
someone make that video game yeah let's
make that I don't think that happened or
like band name like if you're like an
experiment like experimental rock oh
nothing I okay yes someone I want to
look at that this is a thing I spelled
it wrong we wait with that actually bit
it would be it Abba ABBA cot yeah
avocado have a kind NetSuite consulting
okay search like a becau ban sees me a
band called addict I already want just
be a nerd band I hope their experimental
rock no okay make a band call it a back
I and play external rock when show
whatever sent that's all we need thanks
for watch control this week guys we
didn't have a ton of crazy news topics a
lot of what was happening in the tech
world this week was that NAB with all
the cameras and cool software stuff and
things that happen at a photo video and
movie show so it gets all of raining on
Twitter follow branded on Twitter
Wow I don't know his exact handle I
think is Brandon Reilly underscore why
underscore League yeah okay so Brenda my
Twitter I'm sure he collecting stuff in
the show also I believe we've uploaded
some videos recently well that's kind of
the whole point of this company so
yes yeah I think we've done that also
because I forgot to promote my own
system check out floatplane Club you can
go to the forum if you go to the forum
and look at the buttons on the top of
the forum which I will actually just
show you I don't know why I didn't
already do that you can go to if you're
signed in there's a floatplane Club
button and if you have a floatplane Club
right under here where it says forum
information right in this little area
right before computer hardware there's a
section called flow playing club and you
can see all of our non time-sensitive
videos one week early and that includes
tech cookie we've got some great stuff
for you just today we posted a video
floatplane featuring this guy in what I
think is one of the funniest sketches
that we've done on tech wiki basically
ever so it was fun to do we haven't done
a ton of sketches on tech quickie yeah
but so it was kind of cool to like intro
video that way and stuff yeah it's a
piece on the inherent nihilism of modern
life yes but with tech so yeah which is
pretty cool yeah so if you want to check
that out and tons of other really cool
lino types of stuff like if you want to
be a little pre-emptive about it because
