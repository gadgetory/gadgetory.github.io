of the legendary Slick himself and we've
got a lot of cool topics you want to
just kind of say hi to everyone
everybody ha sorry I actually haven't
had a chance to eat dinner yet tonight
so I hope that's I hope it's okay with
you guys if I just kind of now on
something half so what I'd like to do is
kick things off with a little bit of Q&amp;amp;A
with list lick himself if you guys
aren't familiar with our Twitter handles
we're actually only gonna be monitoring
my Twitter tonight so you're gonna want
to go ahead and ask any questions you
have on Twitter and I am gonna take a
little break and eat and slick is gonna
do some Q&amp;amp;A oh that's okay I don't worry
I got this I got this talk at the camera
don't talk to me
all right we're a full minute lay with
the livestream how dare you you know
what we have been guys we have gone
through hell and back to bring you this
livestream because we actually had to
shoot another video tonight with what
looks like some brother actually you
want to talk a little bit about that my
brother and my mom actually my mom is
hosting a charity called caregivers
Nadeau it's for caregivers of family
members forget it's for caregivers or
family members and whatnot they don't
get paid for what they're doing so if
you're taking care of some sort of
family member you don't get paid for it
take support your time you don't really
get any days to yourself this is for you
it's more just in our area so it's more
of a local thing but my brother thought
they'd help fund the event because
there's dinner and everything included
it's all paid for by my family brother
thought you'd help fund the event by
holding an online Starcraft tournament
so it's $5 buy-in $2.50 goes towards the
pot and $2.50 goes towards the charity
and yeah it'll be just a fun event for
everyone all right we have some
questions for slick
we love you slick that's not really a
question here we go okay we're gonna
pretend that someone asks like that
there you go
I'll build a computer or look into
building a computer there's tons of room
places can go OCN now you asked how you
got started how did I get started I
built a computer and when I got started
ncx wasn't really around so I researched
some parts online I went on to a couple
of forums don't remember what they were
at the time but just a whole bunch of
old-school Hydra forums asked around for
what parts people liked looked up
reviews performance reviews whatnot
why did you want a computer ok yeah yeah
those people is that gambling one other
time that's the elbow - my dad had built
a computer for the other one awesome but
what else we got here guys you're late
which is getting out of control come on
guys I was like two minutes late cheese
you guys are killing me here we're
waiting very patiently for hours that
come on guys it says okay here just to
make this clear you switch to full
screen here okay if you go to twitch I
always say when we will be live again
and wow that's oh that's gonna get
that's gonna get real confusing real
fast see will be live again at the time
Pacific time and the date so if you're
ever wondering at what point we are
going to be live again on the twitch
channel you can just check at any time
so so I don't want to hear that you guys
waited four hours for the stream because
I told you when it was gonna be alright
let's do some more Twitter here go ahead
take it away slick showed up to your mom
okay that's pretty cool awesome
I haven't you are okay I was biking to
school came down a hill went around a
corner and as I came around the corner
and a car came up right up beside me so
we were both going on the corner
together as we got around the corner and
I was coming into school I got pushed
into the gutter this was the first big
day of fall so there's tons of wet
leaves everywhere there's a ramp for
people to walk up onto the sidewalk and
I tried to turn up on there but I
couldn't see because of all the leaves
that were covering it was that
rampe actually still had a Ledge about
this much inside of the side box that
was good much so when I turned to try
and go up on it my wheel went completely
sideways and I went head over heels my
bike and landed on the big curb right on
my shoulder and then screwed up my hand
as well so that was on Monday so they're
probably gonna want to know if your arm
is broken my arm is not broken no bones
are broken no fractures the muscles in
my shoulder are pretty messed up and
there's a big cut and my fingers are
quite cut up but I can still move them
so cool story bro let me know guys we've
got another question for slick I've got
one brother no other siblings
he's quite interested in technology he's
got his own water cooled cosmos - I
think you actually tweeted pictures of
that right I have tweeted pictures of
that that's a pretty early on but if you
go to my Twitter and check out the
pictures they've some of the only
pictures I have on there so should be
able to find it it's pretty sick so
remember guys you can follow slick on
twitter at slick pc see i make these
cool little twitter tags for this week
which are very high-tech and i made them
in photoshop alright so slick why did
you decide to show up this time I didn't
actually I don't really necessarily care
about showing myself it's always been
kind of a fun game for people to look
for me reflections I remember one of my
favorite things was closer to when I
first started we had a video where in
the background of the TV could see me
really well so I came with the idea of
putting random stuff on my head we put a
few we put a shoe yeah and something
else I think was locked yeah a box or
something and that was pretty fun
because people got to guess what it was
I don't know some people you know it
took a while but then people started
actually noticing it so that was pretty
awesome yeah okay
hmm I actually haven't heard of the 570
LX but if it's basically similar to an H
100 but with a thicker radiator then it
should just beat yeah yeah pretty much
like here say will collectively three
thumbs up because okay we got more
questions here's here's a good one no I
don't know kind of simple but I didn't
really think it was that big of a deal
it's it's Linus tech tips yeah here's
something okay
I've actually received you guys would be
surprised I've actually received a ton
of messages over the year sort of
condemning my my disrespectful treatment
of slick cameraman all these various
sorts of characters so slick can you set
the record straight once and for all
where your any baby feelings hurt no
banter usually goes back and forth
off-camera there's a couple where people
were like I'm unsubscribing Bubble Boy
the one I remember was in it I don't
remember exactly what boy it was I think
his Emma side said something seven make
sure you're projecting it I think it was
the Emma sides at 77g 65 a I'm boxing
outside and I was trying to cover up the
Sun so there was a shadow on it so you
could see right everybody said but
people got pretty up about it no because
it was kind of it was kind of homo
because you were really close to me so I
was like well okay I was like this and I
was unboxing something oh you're a
little close it was just it was one of
those things it was like I thought
you're gonna give me a man hug no no
off-camera banter goes back and forth so
I can totally understand how that might
have looked on camera but it's actually
fine
once it's off-camera I get him back and
just so you guys know what attach to my
left foot I have like a blade that I've
been sticking into it if he doesn't say
that it's okay then I was gonna like
stab him so yeah all right what else we
got
should be fine here sorry she'll be fine
try the windows seven drivers they
should work
more questions about the arm I'm ok geek
tweeze 500 flip a that's a good question
so from the h1 100 I we actually we
actually shot an unboxing tonight I'm
gonna go find it this new magnetic
mounting hardware is pretty awesome so
that you can easily switch out the
hardware for if you want to into your
intel the new tubing is great it's
really cool make sure you're projecting
a camera the radiator seems exactly the
same the new fans are awesome a lot
better than what they were before
they're basically of course our SP fast
but they simplified a bit no more rubber
mounting system no more - through there
no more ring yeah no color color
customization yes so this is really cool
guys so it has 3/8 inch tubing now which
is kind of Awesome so you can see it's
super thick tubing okay you can't see it
at all but super thick tubing compared
to what we had before and instead of
those screws that you use to put the
mounting hardware on it you just got a
little clip that goes over top and it's
held in place by a magnet so you can
swap between the Intel and the AMD
mounting hardware very very easily which
is really cool so I mean that's what
coarser link yeah and Chris Riley and
the Asheville water block is very glossy
now and that's pretty cool yeah look
sweet
I mean glossy bothers me when it's a
monitor bezel yeah but when you're not
really touching it all the time or it's
not really in like dressed yeah yeah I
mean it's sideways so it should have a
hard time settling on there should be ok
I think well yeah guys we'll have an
unboxing coming of the H 100 very soon
I'm gonna upload it sometime tonight
after I upload the livestream video so
good question very good question all
right
okay Jared what would you recommend for
an animal gaming mouse in an MMO gaming
blue backlit keyboard well for one thing
you're not giving us a lot of options
with the MMO gaming blue backlit
keyboard because you can either try to
dig up one of the legendary Logitech G
15 gen ones good luck with that because
the people who have them are you know
yeah yeah I'm not giving them up or you
could go with something like
Corsair k9d but the k9d has some
compatibility issues with some
motherboards unless they've received
BIOS updates for a mouse my personal
pick is still the Naga I've used the G
600 I've used the m9 TM 90s not bad but
I would still I would pick the Naga what
would you go I'm not actually a huge fan
of the more MMO branded mice and
keyboards okay but I think we can all
agree k9d is better than k60 yes I'll
actually do that if you if you don't
actually use the macro keys on the side
of your keyboard because most people I
know that have them don't actually use
them I know more a lot of people that I
know that have MMO like they play a lot
of animals and they like they're in my
mo here use the ones on the mouse but
not the keyboard so if you use the ones
on the mouse I know
rat or Mad Catz is coming out with a new
MMO Mouse pretty soon there's k9d
there's did you try the g600 yet no top
just feels a little bit leggy to me like
it's not only the Logitech one yeah yeah
I haven't tried it but I've heard a lot
of reviews about it being my thumbs
it just it just doesn't feel quite right
like even something like like m60 or m90
or g9g9 X those guys like it's like
twitch responsive but then I noticed I
love Logitech peripherals but other than
their g7 10 plus which recently came out
there are more recent stuff I'm not a
huge fan of g7 10 pluses kind of
outstanding it's pretty great actually
and for keyboards in China if you're
looking for a blue backlit keyboard if
you want to be mechanical check out
ducky your deck I know they both deeply
bad points all right we have a hundred
and twenty three new interactions oh boy
um Audigy - LS - Eclair Oh hallo do
people still buy a Clara carts Clara
helo is HT Omega card right loser I
think so yeah Clara halos a little bit
on the outdated side I mean it's still a
very good quality car and I'd probably
go with something like zone rst at this
point though for a more modern modern
solution that you know is going to keep
getting driver support because with us
soundcards there's that super build
quality which really doesn't change
because analog and even Dax to a certain
point are not advancing nearly as fast
as a lot of stuff but when it comes to
driver support that's where you can run
into issues with an obscure sound card
and if you get the right sound card you
can get swappable op amps and other
things so you can actually change it a
bit down the line oh yeah that's true
too
um personally I'm not a big fan of the
sort of dedicated PhysX card modern
cards are so fast is kind of unnecessary
Ryan good question if you're upgrading
to Windows 8 here I'm gonna oh oh it's
not working okay two seconds guys okay
it's like answer that question and then
I will fix this thing I personally still
Windows 8 on my laptop just two more try
it out because it's a develop my laptop
is a permanent development suite for me
I don't see a huge difference I don't
actually use optical drives that often
anymore I'm thinking about swapping out
the optical drive on my laptop actually
for an additional hard drive or SSD Bay
so yeah I would probably just download
it and load it onto a USB okay yeah that
pretty much covers it okay what are you
eating - oh I'm having a honey garlic
honey garlic pork and and rice and
broccoli and okay I thought the cat was
trying to attack that oh here we already
covered this one awesome my net n 600
okay here's a good question so what's
his name gen P min big neuron asks my
net n900 or Linksys new AC router so I'm
gonna let I'm gonna let slick talk in a
minute here but first I want to jump to
our YouTube comm slashes so this is the
channel that I maintain for NCIX there
we go so this is the channel I maintain
friends okay sorry the audio should be
fixed now this is the Gipsy you guys are
probably freaking out about it now this
is the channel and maintained for NCIX
and we actually just did a video on
Western Digital my net family of routers
and what we did
is we actually went to slicks house see
here we are in slicks house and here I'm
gonna go fullscreen so I'm gonna let you
guys watch this segment because it's
kind of interesting on the Western
Digital my net n900 central router to
see if it can handle anything we can
throw at it pretty much his internet
connection is 25 megabits down two
megabit up and we are absolutely
hammering it
we have Diablo 3 as well as another game
updating right now we have an FTP
download going on this notebook over a
we're gonna skip a bit here guys
so basically here's uh here's me and
slick with Netflix running and a Skype
call going at the same time well we've
got the network super loaded ups in
which we of course have permission for
we are streaming I guess we have one of
his other roommates you can actually see
diesel here you can see diesel right
here filming behind the camera cuz
that's my end of the sky cult to you
torrent clients running on separate pcs
all running off them alright so let's
get back to let's get back to business
so it's like what was your take because
we actually tested the EA 4500 that's
the cloud cloud router and the mine at
900 so we did that we showed the test
with the 900 but take it away the 4500
was kind of insane to put it lightly I
brought down the firmware right
yeah we're not using the cloud firmware
on it we brought it off cloud from work
as neither of us are either a fan of Cod
firmware we were running two or three
utorrent connections that were all
downloading and uploading we were
downloading and uploading to an FTP we
had a roommate of mine streaming on
Twitch we had just everything we could
possibly a Skype call we had everything
we could really think of to hammer the
network and then if 45-hundred just
didn't care I ran everything perfectly
things were kind of insane but
everything that we were actually doing
actively was running seamlessly now the
original intention of the episode was to
show like a head to head because it was
WD who asked us to do the episode about
their fast-track feature which is key OS
very
it's maintenance-free you just it's
automatic automatic QoS so we were like
okay let's test it against something
that doesn't have automatic us and we
were expecting to be able to demonstrate
like a huge difference in the
prioritization
now the my net did prioritize the
traffic the Netflix stream didn't
degrade in quality in the Skype call was
maintained but what happened was when we
started to throw more stuff at it but
like the game pings when we tried it at
the end was about a second on the my
neck my net router playing League of
Legends yeah so so what that meant was
that it was the the prioritization was
working but when we actually put it
head-to-head against the Linksys router
it wasn't necessarily a good
demonstration let's just put it that way
so so pretty much the answer to that
question I think is pretty
straightforward I would probably go with
okay I don't think I would actually buy
the AC router though because there's
nothing AC unless you really want it but
the EA 4500 is really great but I'm
expecting that the 6500 would be pretty
much more of the same yeah okay yeah see
this this pretty much that pretty much
summarizes the sentiments on anyone with
with g15 gen 1g 15 the best - Jen - yeah
you can have it
I had no G 15 for a really really long
time and it took me like it took me like
so I was looking down access depressed
it took me like three months to pick a
keyword when it died because I was just
so unhappy when I died and I loved
mechanical keyboards but there's just
something about G 50 like the original G
15 so it was just absolutely amazing I
still have it upstairs even though it's
completely dead I just kind of refused
to get rid of it selim asks what's a
good FPS gaming mouse I like my g 9x I
also like g5 hundreds like I've already
said earlier I'm a pretty big fan of
Logitech peripherals mainly they're mice
actually for keyboards I usually go for
more mechanical ones but I guess they
have loose em in ten plus
yeah but not in blue switches so I
probably I'll wait for that oh we put it
but yeah GNX I really like g500 I really
like me Onix one is also really good
yeah as idols exterior I'm using these
days keyboard yeah it's like they're old
nails 5500 nails 500 yeah my wife uses
our nails 3200 she really likes see our
economics yeah okay here we go so two
two quick questions here won't the h100
eye magnet interfere with the
motherboard or any hardware no universal
scripts asked what is your opinion on
Shh sorry that's the baby what is your
opinion on Windows 8 strictly as a
non-touchscreen
OS and actually slick spent more time
with Windows 8 that I have so far so
take it away I really like the feel of
it like when you search for programs and
stuff it flows really well it seems - it
feels very natural everything flows as
you I miss Aaron glasses I miss Aero
glass
I actually don't um for a little while I
did but I don't actually think it's that
big of a deal because I I think the
reason they took it out and this is just
purely speculation I think the reason
they took it out probably has nothing to
do with it not being better like I think
it's way better that's cuz it's all
generalized so the tablets and phones
would have a problem with it
and you can feel that when you use it
though that's that's the pet peeve I
have a buddy you can tell when you do
certain things that this was designed
for a tablet this was designed for a
phone this was designed for a
touchscreen so there's usually at least
one more step to everything and it
doesn't sound like a lot but when you go
to shut your computer down and like I
move you from class to class I want to
shut down really quickly when there's
one extra step it's just tedious and I
know you riddle me this why do you need
to shut down because it wakes and sleeps
so fast but if you ever do need to shut
down like for whatever reason it if you
wake in sleep it's the same thing I've
had some problems closing my tablet out
of my laptop and moving from class to
class but it that's more to do with the
fact that I had a pre-release version of
Windows 8 but I don't think had full
functionality yet so that's probably it
but back then I was constantly shutting
I'm going from
claps but no matter what you do there's
usually one more step or say if you want
to open another notepad so if you
already have a notepad open I press
Start type notepad press Enter
it will just bring the notepad that you
already have open forward on screen
instead of actually opening a new
notepad like I did in all previous
versions of Windows so instead you have
to either go down a middle click on it
with your mouse wheel or right-click and
create a new instance which is just I
liked the old way I don't I'm not a huge
fan of it as a non touchscreen desktop
always but yeah but you'll stubbornly
use it I will still really use it I will
give it time I'm excited for Service
Pack 1 right I mean there's a couple
little things that I'm kind of looking
at going well if they just fix this then
it would be a billion times better like
the search search right now you click
search and then or you you click the
Start menu and then you type in
something and if you don't have the
right type of thing that you're
searching for selected it won't find
anything so if you're looking for a
setting like device manager or whatever
you have to go under settings and it's
default as apps so it's just annoying
you should just be able to type it and
press Enter but you have to type it and
click on the thing and then yeah yeah so
on the other hand surface RT is amazing
surface RT is meaning there is other
really cool things with Windows 8 - file
transfers are awesome I know they're
amazing awesome remember when we were
trying to do those benchmarks with the a
data drive oh no seven machine and it
was like just completely derping out I
tried it on the Windows 8 machine it's
like so easy I get a useful readable
benchmark I mean I'm using I'm using
Windows 8 for any kind of file transfer
any kind of like storage benchmarks from
now on that's that's just it ya know
absolutely great shows you a perfect
graphical map of how it's transferring
yeah and they're possible which is
amazing absolutely love them use that
constantly yeah all of that is just
great the new task manatees awesome I
love task manager and it even works on
like the RT tab yeah which is cool it's
great like there is really really good
things about it but there's also things
that I'm not a huge fan of and they
could fix that in further service packs
or whatever so okay so let's move into
one of our discussion topics um I don't
know if you guys have heard about this
already or if
haven't heard about this already but if
you haven't then motherboards dot-org
the channel - disco motherboards or you
know the one with with Elric is no
longer the motherboards or a channel
with Elric so if you guys haven't seen
this already check this out in the last
couple days here we'll go on socialblade
yeah this will probably be interesting
so Elric left motherboards dorg
published a video on his other channel
Tech tomorrow or tomorrow Tech I think
stuck tomorrow I think it might be ok
it's one of the two um telling his
subscribers to unsubscribe because his
channel had been taken from him so in
the last couple days uh yeah it helps if
I take the thing in the last couple days
he has shed thousands of subscribers
there we go ok so check that out guys in
the past couple days he has lost about
thirteen thousand subscribers from the
motherboards orange channel which
basically is yeah I mean what anything
what aren't even gonna do with it like
realistically think about this guy's
what if I was like fired from NCIX then
I don't know it's like would you do -
tech tips probably not
okay so then hold on okay couple things
guys so there's a lot of there's a lot
of people in the twitch chat and I'm
here I'm gonna let you guys I'm gonna
let you twitch chat guys talk for a
little bit here there's a lot of people
in the twitch chat that are there saying
you know oh well you know a blah blah
blah he wasn't he wasn't that great
anyway blah blah so it's not really the
point the point is it's very difficult
to recast someone who is sort of the
face and I'm not saying who was right
and who was wrong because I have no idea
but I mean would you watch for example
actually okay a lot of other channels do
you even follow okay time to leave
customs yeah we do watch it without tiny
Tom Logan no the only other guy I really
watch is tiny son
and the only reason why I watch him is
if he goes so into depth of things so
that I can't actually just get this from
reading a little blurb and without him
that channels dead if he lost if he left
for some reason it's his things we came
in to be fired but not for some reason I
would see no reason to watch any more
videos the whole thing is branded on a
person like what was that TV show where
the guy got fired because smoke too much
crack what oh yeah when he left like
does anyone actually watch that show
anymore I know right
Ashton Kutcher yeah as far as I've heard
it just no one cares and like Ashton
Kutcher kitchener he's apparently a good
actor but like no one cares the the
whole idea of the show is gone
right okay so that was something that we
said we were gonna talk about I want to
talk about another thing so everyone
knows what this is and this of course
looks like the same thing which is of
course a reason that Apple should get a
lot of money so it's official the galaxy
s3 is the top selling its smartphone
ever or something like that right yeah
okay what's that mean here's my okay
here's my here's my problem
and I'm not I'm not an Apple fanboy at
all but here here's here's the thing s3
they spend on the hardware that much is
that much is clear so they designed this
phone maybe they take a lower margin on
it at the beginning and make okay we're
gonna put like a huge screen in it and
we're gonna like put like a super-fast
processor in or whatever else but would
you would you argue that the build
quality is better than an iPhone 4 and
iPhone 5 not necessarily they're both
really high build quality phones it's
been plastic so it means so what's your
favorite pet what's your favorite
backing on sensor monitors brushed
aluminum or fake okay but we're not
talking about that we're talking we're
talking about a phone it's really
durable I've dropped it a couple times
already can you tell probably if a
little Selena
aa-actually okay okay okay fine it's
actually really good like there's
differences between plastic you know
that okay
forget foeman let's let's move it let's
let's look at like notebooks then okay
notebooks Apple spends on the build
quality their notebooks this is true I'm
questionable yeah I mean I had an HP
EliteBook for a while there but I was
just kind of tinkering around I was
going wow this is built really well for
a PC and then I kind of looked at it I
went yeah but it's priced like a mac so
I would make I guess I would make the
argument that even if you're not getting
sort of the the hard burst back or even
if you're not getting whatever else I
think there's an inherent value to build
quality I this is a I've dropped it okay
fine cement a couple times what about
the fact that Apple's phone is so much
faster now oh I have never had a single
problem with speed with this phone I
know but I've never had a single problem
with speed for my iPhone 4 I can play a
game and watch a video at the same time
and even wag I think that's good enough
that's good enough for you so basically
phones are as fast okay there you go
slick steps hitman oh I disagree phones
are as fast as they ever need to be
enjoy it's not slow no one will ever
need more than 512 kilobytes okay okay
okay fine let me put it this way okay
let's move on to tablets then okay
tablets I would argue that iPad
absolutely smokes everything else yeah I
do like okay surface I like yeah let's
go back to an Android then okay okay I'm
not I'm not willing to fight for Android
in the tablet tablet market they just
don't have it right now okay I I will
stand behind on with phones
I like their phones I don't like the
usability experience of an iPhone
okay I would argue that it's excellent
but but no for me have you ever used one
because I kind of did you ever actually
use one day today I have iPhone 3G
my mom has it right now use it as an
iPod I don't like it there's it's it's
you have to sign in to the App Store
every single freaking time I'm signing
it to my phone I just want to use my
phone
the only argument I've heard that that
is actually viable is so that your kid
can't go on their phone and buy a
million different things there's
parental controls in here you can turn
on parental controls and make it so you
just can't buy things so I've had four
there's a lot of sort of there's a lot
of those people are talking a lot of
smack about how iPad 4 is just an iPad 3
with a faster processor um okay but it
doesn't cost more yeah and then it's not
like that's any different from what they
usually done
does it ever cost more I thought they
always released in the same print it
always comes at the same price point the
one thing we saw last time though was
they kept the iPad 2 around but at a
lower price point as sort of like so
with iPad Mini there's like a good
better best kind of placement strategy
here so with a 6x which i think is the
chip in the iPad 4 which they're not
calling an iPad 4 it's the new iPad
again wait six or seven after the last
new iPad there's baby they're basically
two generations ahead of anything else
in terms of performance why they're
there ARM processors I was talking to a
friend at school Theo if you're out
there hello I don't know if this is true
this is something I heard from a friend
of school so don't quote wink but he's
pretty credible so I think so and he was
saying that Apple is they haven't made
an official statement anything but
they're seriously considering going with
ARM processors for everything really
ditching Intel and I think that might
give in to a little bit of a wake-up
call for the tablet market I certainly
hope so yeah
because surface is amazing and I can't
really fight for any Android tablets
although I'd like to but I just can't
but again the same thing holding back
surface is holding back Android tablets
in a big way and it's Tegra free I know
I
Tegra 3 was good when it came out it was
good but even then it wasn't as fast as
iPad 2 iPad 3 was faster iPad 4 is
faster again it's a 2
and it already wasn't that competitive
so why is it that nvidia can't afford to
make a faster ship or samsung can't
afford it I mean even Galaxy Note 10.1
has a faster chip in it than a Tegra 3
but using it did not feel like anything
like using an iPad um I think Nvidia is
more going through the value market
right now I know it's kind of weird
because it video usually goes bigger it
goes home but but they trumpet the
performance of taker from the rooftops
yeah I know and they really need to get
the game up because they are getting
destroyed by arm and so does Intel until
needs to wake up and actually care about
tablets and start destroying arm because
Intel has the power to do it Nvidia is
awesome but I think there's still even
though they say they're kind of focusing
on tablets I think they're still
focusing on the desktop room I'm trying
to make things not an enterprise an
enterprise and I like myself and I think
that's what Intel is doing too they care
more about desktops they care more about
servers it kills me about what Intel's
been doing lately and it comes down to
die size Intel chips now that I okay
okay you look at sort of think about
this so the pricing of AMD CPUs versus
until say 80 CPUs AMD has a four module
piledriver
chip 8350 that has an enormous die like
we're talking a die that is at least I
can't remember the exact measurements
but it's more than double the size of an
int elephant 770 caged I sighs compared
to that so when it comes to how much a
CPU costs or how much any chip costs
like this chip you know this chip
doesn't matter what chip it comes down
to the manufacturing process so we are
indeed that went into it and then it
comes down to the die size because the
die size is the odds that a defect will
appear on that part of the wafer so
wafers about this big and then you can
put as many chips as you can and the
bigger the guy said any wafer is gonna
have defects especially around the
outsides the bigger the die size the
bigger the chance there's a significant
defect on it it can't be used so Intel
if you watch they've been shrinking
their manufacturing process they haven't
been giving us
any kind of they've been shrinking the
die size that's dedicated to the actual
CPU for the last few generations so what
could they do if they were actually
paying attention if AMD was actually
giving them a run for their money and
this ties back into my point about Apple
as well they could use their real estate
more and just blow them out of the water
isn't it
2011 didn't they like burn off - of
course
uh yeah yes what do you love it will the
the server chips are up to eight course
yeah yeah and then the extreme edition
which is supposed to be the even the new
extreme edition 3970 X which is supposed
to be like 150 watt TDP so in theory
they didn't even care about TDP but all
we got out of it was a couple hundred
more megahertz and they did not leave in
the other two cores and I'm I mean IV
sandy bridge-e Ivy bridge-e Ivy bridge-e
which is coming I think it's supposed to
be up to 12 course but whenever it comes
it will come I think I used to be a
pretty big fan of AMD back with their at
164 and iPhone 64 x2 you're a
fair-weather friend is basically what
you're trying to say but yeah but Andy
just hasn't been competing properly
lately Intel's just been absolutely
destroying and because Andy isn't
actually giving Intel a run for their
money
until doesn't have to care they can just
keep on making things cheaper and
cheaper so that their profit margins are
higher yeah but just they just don't
have to care on the other hand what do
they have to do because they're a
publicly traded company publicly traded
companies are always evaluated based on
growth have to make money yeah yeah so
they have to make money they have to
show growth if they're not increasing
profit margins or increasing revenues
are doing both then they're gonna get
destroyed
so the PC desktop PC market is pretty
saturated and I've got my own opinions
about why that is I don't think it has
anything to do with the desktop being
dead as a platform I think it should I
mean how old is your parents okay you're
probably a bad example that your friends
how old are their parents computers my
friend's parents computers are really
old five years probably around there
three machines there's they're all XP
machines all my friends parents
computers rxq machines or they're my
friends old computers which are now
so it's hard to sell CPUs if you're not
buying people aren't buying computers
but that doesn't mean they're not still
using desktops so we can put that aside
forever the desktop is not dead but if
your Intel what choice do you have now
you have to increase your margins or you
have to try and find a way to sell more
stuff or you have to expand into new
markets I mean I think SSD is gonna be a
big deal yeah you look at what's going
on with those easier right now you look
at what's going on with anyone who's not
a manufacturer yeah and guys like
Samsung guys like Intel where they have
fabs they have the technology the
vertical guys those those are gonna be
the guys who win yeah where are we going
with this they will not actually
entirely sure but like Intel can make
their own modules and cherry-pick them
too so it's not really fair for the guys
everybody functioning there oh yeah
that's true
ain't old Samsung just cherry-pick their
own stuff right okay so back to my date
back to my Apple thing so here's my
period as to why Apple can be two
generations ahead of everyone else in
terms of performance they spend on die
size you look at the size of something
like an a6 X compared to a Tegra 3 it is
huge it absolutely dwarfs Tiger 3 it's
not rocket science I mean a professor is
how many transistors are in it basically
and then the advantage of a smaller
manufacturing process is basically the
the whole point is being able to stuff
more transistors into that space because
you reach a point of diminishing returns
but it gets this big the delay to get a
signal from here to here across the chip
and sort of all the traces in between
becomes too much so as long as you stay
within a certain size and it's all good
but if you look back at like older
remember when CPUs didn't have it gets
better on and how big good cores were
having there's so much smaller now
whereas Apple is interesting because
NVIDIA doesn't get to take money from
the manufacturing but neither does Apple
they don't get to take money from the
screen they don't get to take money from
the AppStore they don't get to take
money from the button anything else
Apple gets to take margin on almost
every aspect of this device
and Apple can make money on other things
too like cables and cases and whatnot
yes accessories so what happens I I
believe the reason that they can be so
far ahead is they can just spend on dice
eyes they can go okay
we don't care make the chip as because
your words Nvidia only gets to sell a
chip so they have to optimize you know
like think about the margins you need if
you're a chip maker so that that tangra
device that you have
but that Tegra device you have Nvidia
only got to take a profit on that one
little thing so if they were to take
like what's apples gross margins 4045
percent surround that so if Apple gets
to take 45 percent on a phone then and
video if Nvidia only gets to take 45
percent on a phone that means apples
taking a couple hundred dollars or on a
chip rather for Nvidia and NVIDIA if
that chip has to be part of a phone that
costs five hundred dollars and they're
getting forty five percent of whatever
that is they're only getting to take a
few bucks so they have to have much
higher profit margins so that's my
theory I don't think anyone can catch up
unless it's maybe Samsung I think
Samsung can catch up Intel could catch
up full solution providers yeah I I wish
I hope I hope Tegra doesn't die I like
kind of like Nvidia and I like where
they're going with it they're trying
really hard they're pushing for the
gaming side of it and stuff but it's
just not there well Wayne's gonna be
significantly faster than the current
generation product I mean the the
roadmap that I saw at the last Nvidia
partner conference basically high
performance going like this I think they
were saying by 2014 or 2015 we were
gonna have Core i5 level performance in
a Tegra product I mean I they're very
much in the game and as a solutions
provider I think they'll they'll always
be a big winner yeah I mean AMD is
finally turning things on with hey but
have you seen the new AMD drivers I'm
not never settle drivers are adding 10
to 15 percent across the board on
7000-series cards in triple-a time
there's their cards haven't really been
a problem though yeah they're gothis
cards have been really good
it's other areas that they've been
failing in right okay let's do some
Twitter Q&amp;amp;A for a while guys let's see
if we got some good questions on the
Twitter's I'm gonna go ahead and switch
to my Twitter window here so you guys
can actually see what's going on all
right back up to the top and we have 321
new interactions
yeah well innocence lick 7950 versus
660ti I'm slick before you answer that
question I would like you to remember
that 7950 now has 10 to 15 better that
10 to 15% better performance across the
board compared to when you last time
smart to them right that probably means
that in raw performance the 7950 will
win okay
I like over if you get a 60 CTI power
Edition no not anymore they revised it
and we do you have them pull it back
seriously yeah so now 7950 smoke 660ti
and overclocking yeah that's lame I'm
really really really I called them out
at PAX I really really really don't like
what Nvidia is doing with their over
volting stuff and when I asked them I
actually got one of my buddies asked him
he was on here actually Harrison I got
him to ask him when he when Harrison
asked them they said specifically oh
we're not doing anything we're not doing
anything that's up to the board partners
but if the board partners do anything
about it
like what MSI did I'm guessing like
Nvidia pulls all warranty yeah so they
can't afford that
that's where Nvidia used to stand behind
them but now they don't stand behind
them so they are doing something
okay the flip side of that is if I
manufacture the CPU cooler and I say
you're not allowed to run the pump at 14
volts or 15 volts or 20 volts or
wherever the limit is but you don't have
the right to single warranty yes and
that's true but NVIDIA has always
covered this and now they have pulled it
back that's all taking away an advantage
of your product if you if you run a
company for 20 years I'm just pulling
random numbers 20 years and you've
always had one big strong thing that
everyone really likes you for it and
then you take it away you can't expect
people to just be like oh yeah that
totally makes sense people are gonna be
upset it's annoying
and like putting people in weird
situations like MSI where they have to
backpedal from there over vaulting right
that was so cool that 660ti power
Edition was epic I love that card in now
so basically it's a business decision at
the end of the day it comes back to that
if you know what it comes back to that
whole like die size and margins and
shrinking business because graphics as I
mean everyone wants to talk about PC
gaming isn't dying PC gaming is not
dying Liga legend its most played game
right here's the problem though is that
League of Legends does not help sell
graphics cards that's true it's true
high-end PC gaming has been a very sad
thing for a very long time Crysis 3 I'm
hoping starts to turn this around
maybe I've heard that it will I've heard
that it will Yuri whatever his name is
has basically said you know what screw
your graphics card and your memory and
your CPU I'm going to crush it all so
great I think that's great for PC gaming
star citizen using CryEngine 3 yeah
looks really exciting space sim game so
I'm hoping it all turns around but when
when when guys pitched those sort of PC
gaming as growing numbers they're
talking about they're talking legal
legends ok whatever they're talking
about mainstream stuff tangle these are
technically PC games these are
technically PC gamers but they're not
buying gtx 680 so at the end of the day
nvidia again is a public company what do
they have to do they have to reduce
their RMA's they have to find other ways
to tighten up their business they have
to take smaller dies 680 is a smaller
die size then I think at least 3 or 4
generations back with high-end cards one
thing to though like NVIDIA has always
said there it's in the game campaign but
they used to be way more aggressive
about it and stuff like Borderlands
where they made it kind of cheesy where
it's just it detects what kind of
graphics card you have and literally
takes things out of the game if you have
any T occurred have you seen that yeah
yeah okay it's pretty brutal like
they'll take out water pipes that shoot
water ATI cards can create water I'm
sure that's not a big deal but they just
removed it from the game like if they
change their push with that and made it
so that Nvidia sponsored games were
just intense and have awesome graphics
hardware and really really good
resolutions and just and by the sound of
things we you isn't gonna turn it all
around no not exactly
but like there is games coming out look
at Kickstarter there's so many games
coming out that are just PCE right so do
it for the games that are just PC why
would it video sponsor games clay on
Kickstarter is kind of the best thing to
happen to PC gaming industry like ever
it doesn't kind of amazing that's the
whole problem with PC gaming and you
guys can argue about it till you're blue
in the face the problem with PC gaming
has been piracy because at the end of
the day it's the most pirated platform
so if you're gonna produce a game for
one platform it's not gonna be a PC
period um on the other hand Kickstarter
takes all the risk away from the
developer although I would argue that
the people yeah because they get the
money upfront they know at least their
cost is covered so if anyone buys the
game then it will be profitable it's
already profitable a lot of situations
because they're selling the game and a
lot of you know only everything every
single Kickstarter situation you're
buying or if you're going below the
buying price which these people do don't
tell my wife I know she can hear us but
I'm actually thinking about buying the
250 dollar star citizen package oh no it
comes with the baller ship Oh for if you
do well my friends for my birthday
bombing the star citizen package the
only author to it I think it's the one
that just gets you thinking just the
game okay and I get a ship but it's
amazing
so basically by the time you get beta
I'll be an expert reader and my ship
will be ownage and hot I wonder if you
get to carry that on anyways so anyway
you sorry you were saying Kickstarter's
include the game yeah so a lot of those
sales already done right that's the
thing and they have to kind of calculate
that in like yes this budget gets to go
towards the development of the game but
that budget also has to go towards
paying everyone because
youth portion most of their sales are
done before the game's release right
which is kind of a really interesting
platform and scary movie skate for a lot
of people but no they're also hitting
like 300 percent of their merchants
alone situations products eternity was
insane project eternity wanted like I
don't remember the numbers I'm sorry but
I think they wanted like eight hundred
thousand dollars they ended up getting
almost four million okay okay here's the
wristband because okay so your point
that most of the sales are probably done
before the game even launches I would
counter that and I would say many
customers will be very uncertain
unless it's an extremely reputable
developer about giving money to a
developer base there's nobody to get
Kickstarter money back if it doesn't hit
well no if the project goes ahead yeah
thank you for the money it's a
Kickstarter it's a it's a it's a it's a
seed fund you don't get it back if the
deject sucks or the game isn't very good
so you're paying 40 bucks for the game
that's that's the cost of a game on
Steam or whatever gets come to game um
what if it turns into a Duke Nukem
Forever type of fiasco where 13 years
later you paid $40 for this game did
speaking did you see the Google image of
the guy who had his original it was like
Oh decrepit but that's the situation
that we could potentially be creating so
I think lots of people will hold out
until the game's done yeah and they can
do that one thing you're doing is like
if you guys follow the project eternity
one obsidian made some of the most
iconic games that have ever been
released but lately haven't been doing
that amazing
they have publicly blamed this
previously on the people that have been
funding them they pushed the project
dates they push the project dates then
the game is released uncomplete brink
think about brink for a second brink was
like one of the biggest disappointments
of the game that I've ever released I
was so excited for brink and then it was
so terrible because it was so obviously
unfinished it was not polished the
single player was multiplayer with box
that was literally like you click on
single player and you might like it's
the exact same map that's a multiplayer
you do the exact same thing except
there's bots on your team and bots on
the other team
like that's not a single-player there's
random cinematics as you're running
through it's like Oh cinematic right
like I don't care this means nothing it
was just horribly unpolished
and I'm complete and if you get your
budget from fans and you can set it
whatever date you want is you have to
set it yeah within reason within a
reason right because you have to set a
date to compare your fans have to accept
that date when they're paying for it so
they have to know it has to be
reasonable but you can have these
allowances that you've never really had
before you can develop things that you
weren't able to before because people
asked for it okay let's go back and do
it let's do some quick Twitter questions
so couch sloth says he likes the show
format of the show tonight
glad to hear it you know what viewership
is actually better than it's been since
I think the first show that I did so
people were either tuning in because
they're super excited to meet the
legendary sulukim soul without a baby's
head hey maybe I'll wear the bag for a
bit so people were like super excited
about that or or or they really are
enjoying the okay I can't read that's
okay I'm joining the format of the show
something something are the main things
I should look for what are the main
things to look for a monitor for gaming
and video editing well those are two
completely different things you want a
gaming monitor you want a 120 Hertz
panel you want video editing you need an
IPS panel or POS panel so opposite you
got to figure out which one's more
important to you here's my secondary
laptop fast enough to run Crysis 2 know
maybe slick wants food slick already ate
yeah what did you have tonight's like
and I had a whopper and I had their fish
burger Fink's on Fridays Burger King has
two dollar fish burgers never had one
before it obviously wasn't that bad
maybe Burger King no Burger King is a
proud sponsor at the lighting tips
livestream today they fed me all the way
to pay for it oh well I'm sorry
sponsorship yeah okay so question from
Bed gone
oh I'm eating that oh do you want some
okay my wife's stealing my pomegranate
so take your take her three isn't
cutting it what are you thoughts on
Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 quad-core chips I
mean that's the thing is these mobile
chips are getting so much faster so
quickly that it's really exciting but my
whole
argument was just that Apple will always
be able to be ahead of the curve because
Qualcomm only gets to take money for the
chip just the same way Nvidia only gets
to take money for the chip or anyone
else even armed to a lesser extent only
gets to take money for the chip and
Apple gets to take money for the entire
solution AMD will be up for sale next
year most probably you know what we
can't speculate on that note we're not
speculating on that you look like you're
about to see so I wasn't I was just glad
to hear you guys liked the format of the
show thoughts on the black widow
ultimate 2013 if they have their new
drivers synapse synapse drivers I am NOT
a fan so synapse drivers basically for
you guys who don't know Razer synapse
software allows you to save like let's
say this was a mom you know what let's
say this wasn't so it allows you to save
to the cloud all of the dpi settings all
the macro settings all the settings that
you would have had for this mouse to do
you can even save the adjustable wait
settings in the bottom of the mouse but
you save it in the cloud so if you take
that mouse and plug it into any computer
log into synapse it will know all of
your settings no big deal and it can
even save game per game profiles yep
which is very cool as well why don't
gamers like this because if you lose
your internet connection for any reason
that you lose all of your settings
because they save it in the cloud if
they had it so like okay I really don't
like origin but this is actually
something to do well they have cloud
storage for safe safe house so
battlefield 3 if I don't have my
battlefield 3 save file that's fine I
can play the game but what hurts me
about steam 2 are they implementing that
yet so every game should just have cloud
save files it's ridiculous of it yeah I
don't I know they do for settings I
don't know if they do for safe I don't
think they do I don't think so there's
so many different developers like it
might be pointed on valve games but that
would be amazing
well most valve games don't have seen
except for haffley
anyways Oh are we getting episode three
okay go ahead yeah so like with origins
thing if you are activated the internet
it'll take that opportunity and download
the save file for you it'll ask you
first it's like do you want to sync up
buh-buh-buh-buh if you say yes downloads
it that's awesome if you have it in your
offline that's awesome that doesn't
really matter with razors new set up the
second you lose internet connection you
lose all of your settings so all sudden
you have like a ten dollar mouse instead
of this beast mode level of expensive
most that you bought and just so you're
saying that's a problem
that's right yes it's not okay she
computers be switched off or left on put
it in sleep Apple has iTunes Android as
Google Play listed okay oh that's an
interesting take on this so we have a
lot of international viewers on our live
streams here's a complaint that a lot of
the features built for Android are
exclusive to the US I mean Google Maps
isn't I'd love for you guys to sort of
pitch in on Twitter or actually you know
what I'm gonna give this one to the
twitch chat guys North America okay yeah
cuz guys we're in Canada so have you
guys run into any issues with Google
applications not working outside of
North America and this is only for the
non North American viewers so we're
going to the twitch chat there we go
we're gonna cover up slick for a change
no one wants to see him anyway Android
is insanely popular in like India it's
going really fast it's hard to read okay
apparently New Zealand is fine China
apparently recently banned some of the
well that's China but doesn't count
China doesn't count it's a population so
that's all China banning it that's not
it just straight up not working
Porto Rico is apparently fine Google
Maps was apparently broken in the UK but
then Sri only half works there too okay
mmm Australia's stupid Maps yeah okay
but then again like apples maps are
stupid everywhere so as I can tell ya
American Republic apparently five
Singaporeans is fine okay Mexico doesn't
have Google music so the only real
complaint so far seems to be about my
google music more than anything else so
okay what else we got here on Twitter we
just turned tore apart an Athlon 64 it's
cool that's very sad cuz that was like
the last thing they need that was
awesome yeah they've been talking about
this for a while actually de-emphasizing
desktop in it and they probably should
because they're just losing I wonder
what's gonna happen with Intel though
because wouldn't that make them a
monopoly
um potentially on the other hand are
they monopoly if arm continues along the
path they're gone
right that's a good point yeah because
they'll make developing free yeah and if
if Windows RT gets the kind of support
that I personally hope it gets then
there'll be with real legitimate desktop
applications that'll Rana
yeah and Windows I mean my hope my
personal hope just to see more
competition is that by the time we see
Windows 9 Windows 10 it's actually a
unified SKU you know there was a way to
do it if there's a way to do it or it's
like it's a single image and then it
either installs an ARM version or it
installs an x86 version and it'll be
fast enough and applications will
continue to get more threaded so arm can
just throw more cores at the problem
which they're very good at yeah and to
the user it should be completely
transparent
where you just download something I
think in much the same way that you
still see like iTunes you still have x86
x64 versions arm version
done I I'm very excited I'd be very
excited to see something like that
Windows 8 Black Friday or Cyber Monday
sales very unlikely it's already really
cheap what's your take on Disney buying
Star Wars this this is a fantastic topic
for discussion because I think it's
fantastic you know what I'm gonna let
slick
you guys his opinion I actually don't
care about his opinion I'll be back in a
moment I'm surprised you worded it like
that because I kind of agree look what
they did with the Marvel heroes Disney
owns Marvel I've literally never heard
of a single person ever complain about
Avengers I've never heard of a single
person ever complain about Ironman the
only one of the new superhero movies
that have actually heard anyone complain
about is Thor but then they have to
follow a certain storyline and I think
for following that storyline that should
be the really good job with that movie
if they stay true to Star Wars if they
stay true to the older Star Wars movies
they will do fine in my opinion and if
they go like way into the future if they
don't try and just go like huh get the
storyline if they jump way in the future
and make it actually make sense I think
those are you really good tell Disney's
a really good company they make really
really good movies I think everything
will be just completely fine
I'm sure they'll spend the money to cast
it right they seem to spend the money to
cast everything right Disney's huge I
don't think there'll be a casting
problem I don't think there will be a
budget problem yeah I think it'll be
great yeah Mickey Mouse has a ton of
freaking money
um I was I going to say I kind of hope
that they follow all the storylines from
the book it would be cool to see like
mace windu one of the epics in there
would be really cool but then if they
keep with the kind of style that they
have going right now with the people
they have nowhere right now just in the
future that would also be great I
personally think that the whole the
whole thing needs to be just kind of
killed okay this this I meant to bring
this on to the stream I actually meant
to talk about the whole Disney star
worst thing even though it wasn't on our
agenda today here's my take on it and
this is gonna be really short whatever
he talked about you don't even need to
think about that anymore because this is
it could it be any worse than this what
could anything Disney does be any worse
than this Q II D
okay next topic the reason why in video
isn't working too hard on their tickets
are working on super microphone okay
fair enough probably who knows uh uh new
Nexus 4 I'm not much of a phone guy have
you heard much about it yeah I've heard
really good things by LG you know what's
really funny is the way that the meaning
of LG has changed their entire company
is called LG it's my life's good I think
you mean lucky gold star just put
everything about LG is great okay um
yeah I've heard really good things I had
a nexus before I had the Nexus S
absolutely love that phone the thing
that I really like about Nexus phones
and like I know Evan s3 right now but
I'm gonna talk up the Nexus a lot more
than I've talked up in s3 is Nexus
phones are very Google branded even
though it's running Android Nexus phones
are way more Google branded it says
Google in the back if you notice s3's
just can't see it that well but they
just say Samsung all the Nexus phones
say Google so Google really cares about
the software on there and every single
time that a new OS would come out with
my nexus s I would get it the next day
right my Nexus S was running jelly bean
then when that died and I went to go
this would get this one the reason why I
was able to get one of these was because
I argued saying that with my service
plan I should get a jelly bean device
instead of the and that's to which was
running an older OS right I argued that
a competent product would have the same
or better OS not purple approval product
would have the same or better he's
really smart that's why that's why and
that's why we work together but he's
never done this thing before I don't
worry guys no no so yeah Nexus phones
are great they have great support it's
gonna be ridiculously fast
okay what about Samsung's value-added
applications third K is Death Note today
yeah but I could also use Evernote okay
I mean honestly I'm just playing devil's
advocate right now because I have the
same belief I mean you know what I think
of how my galaxy vibrator still is
running Gingerbread whereas a Nexus
friend did phone released around the
same time would have the latest OS every
single time live so it's just way better
support I know okay my Galaxy Tab 10.1
got Ice Cream Sandwich like a month and
a half ago officially yes I know I could
root the device yes I know I could
upgrade it unofficial you know what the
camera didn't work with the with the
unofficial upgrade on the tab 10.1 why
should I have a half functional device
I've got a buddy at school that's crazy
into missing out with his phone's
hackneyed as phones you know like I
Stephanie always finds one little thing
that doesn't work and everything on
Nexus is will always work I never had a
single problem of that phone that phone
was amazing remember okay we can do more
Twitter okay I heard there's something
something are being hipsters look at
Nexus 4 alright we have very exciting
news you guys now that we've got a
pretty full full livestream I want to
let you guys know so yours truly the
professional unboxer will be attending
CES this year and I will be accompanied
by none other then slick PC on Twitter
or just slick whichever you prefer we
are going to be trying to do and guys
bear with us here so okay okay lightest
tech tips domain if you guys go there
right now it kind of sucks it's like a
wordpress blog that's just it
automatically publishes whatever I
upload to YouTube nothing special
nothing you can do just fine thought
following me on Facebook or following me
on Twitter or subscribing on YouTube
which is fine too
we're gonna revamp that we're gonna
install the latest vbulletin which is
not only a forum but it's also a content
management system so we can do like
articles and stuff we are going to
attempt okay see yes the biggest problem
with CES coverage is that it's always
late it's incomplete no matter who it is
minor publication major publication they
skip 70% of the show
and it gets uploaded like a week later
what this dynamic duo team potentially
with diesel wait we're not sure yeah I
haven't talked to anybody actually
potentially with diesel is we're gonna
attempt to bring you the entire show
which is gonna mean at least 25 to 30
videos covering three to five booths
each over the span of the sort of three
to four days of is for I can't remember
it's like three or four days that is
running and we are gonna try to give you
guys nightly uploads of everything that
we shot that day so it's gonna almost
kill us yeah may kill us just a little
bit just a little bit but if you go to
the Linus tech tips website around the
time the CES mark this in your calendar
guys marks in your calendar you go there
we're gonna have little written articles
to go with every video telling you
what's up what's in the video what's up
what's going on and it is gonna be the
awesomest thing ever we're gonna be
sponsored by Corsair so Corsair is
sending us down there so you're gonna
see like a powered by Corsair watermark
in the corner and and I mean don't worry
we're gonna still cover everything
not Corsair there are competitors and
all that but guys I want you you know
what I rarely ask you to do this but I
want you to if you're watching on
YouTube I want you to like thumbs up the
video and if you're I don't know
watching on twitch can you like Facebook
share a twitch streamer like I don't
know tell someone about it
there forget all this newfangled hoo-ha
terminology just tell someone about this
because it's exciting so thank you for
reminding me of that slick Oh game
releases coming up in q4 okay slicks
more the gamer so I'm gonna see if
there's some interesting tweets and that
he can talk about that
I am ridiculous okay for some people
this is that already for PC I'm
ridiculously excited processes p3 that
is not out yet on PC I was deceived by
the Assassin's Creed 3 trailer I saw it
on 0 punctuation and had a song on it it
was like I'm coming home I'm coming home
tell the world I'm coming I downloaded
in there was a rap so I am already not
going to buy Assassin's Creed 3 just
we're not going to at all I don't I
don't think you want any of the other
games no I was really disappointed it
turned out to be Diddy know it was one
of those deceptive songs it was like it
was like that Eminem song where they mix
in a really old school song and then yes
so it was like that where I was just
like what 3 is gonna be epic
I've been staying away from spoilers as
much as I possibly can many of you have
probably already played it if you have
consoles but I'm not a huge console fan
I wait for things on PC what else is
there coming back ops to be pretty epic
black ops 2 is gonna be epic zombies
okay I'm not actually a huge cog fans
I'm there's no Max Payne he's coming oh
wait another no Max Payne no I'm playing
complete blank yes hitman absolution I
believe yeah yeah it's quite a few other
ones by this camera top of my head right
now but yeah there's a new expansion for
Battlefield 3 so if you bought premium
you get it for no additional money right
that's gonna say free but yeah but I
can't even play right now punkbuster
won't properly install on my system
really yeah and like I looked on the
forums there's a hole which people have
same problem as me looks like yeah I
just play them like no one secure
service I'm like oh yeah okay
I tried all the fixes none of them seem
to work cuz like I'm like this so I
can't play any games so you can't W a
sandy angle Diablo 3 anyways so I was
like I'll play battlefield 3 and sit in
the base and sit in that little air
defensive Theriot basically this makes
you just a total jackass pretty much but
that's all I could do so it's like
whatever let's do that but I couldn't
even play for more than two minutes per
server so it was completely useless at
least you have the excuse of being like
handicapped in order to behave like that
I get to here this time um ok storm
gaming has a tweet my friend has the Mac
with the Retina screen the screen has
broken twice this brings me to one of
the topics that I wanted to discuss
tonight and that is I tried to do this
on a live stream not that long ago and I
kind of failed because it had been a
really long week and I think brain
farted but I'm gonna try and take
another crack at this okay here's what
I'm trying to figure out why can't I
have a 4k desktop display or laptop or a
laptop even yeah why can't I have that
where I like anything else or anything
else and someone really with a huge name
that will back us up is linus torvalds
yeah well no he didn't say it's he
didn't say it was well you know he
didn't say it was possible yeah it's
just ridiculous okay okay so here here
here here think about it this way guys
okay so 4k what are the challenges for a
long time it was pixel density yeah okay
how old is this device three years No
two and a half years oh man okay iPhone
4 is this pixel this pixel density is
enough to build a 27 inch 4k monitor am
i right right okay so I'm sorry that's
not a problem that's not a problem I
mean you even look at iPad 3 replacement
screens are like 80 bucks yeah so times
4
why can't I buy a 250 dollar or
you know more you know let's let's say
350 400 ah I don't care I just want one
like 27 inch butter why can't I do that
30 inch monitor you know um people have
proven I'm only an s3 we've got iPhone
5s all over the place even though they
have like almost any ways people have
proven its long that people aspire them
you can say oh um anyways people have
proven that they will spend money on
devices even if they make no sense so II
make no sense I would argue that
something like a MacBook retina makes a
lot of sense why don't we have high-res
screens that are optional to buy people
will buy it people cared so much about
the Retina display that's not even that
impressive
like it's awesome and it wasn't than
everything else I agree but it could be
so much better better okay okay so the
argument there might be bigger stuff
costs more and I would like to I would
like to direct your attention to this
when is the last time you went to your
local big-box retailer and checked up
the prices of TVs how much do they cost
nothing compared to before okay so a 55
inch TV you can get for as little as I
think around 600 700 800 bucks so if
that costs $800 and yes the pixel
density is lower but I still don't think
the pixel density of you know a 30-inch
version of that should be you know an
engineering or manufacturing nightmare
so this is only $800 the density we need
is like 80 bucks 90 bucks
why isn't there something in the middle
that marries these two things it just
doesn't seem that complicated it really
it shouldn't be that hard it just should
not be that hard I mean okay couple
things yields so it comes down to the
same thing we were talking about with
die size for chips before you have to
have a yield of a pattern so if you go
okay like they build they build LCDs and
in large large large panels they cut
them up essentially like they cut them
up okay so if you're gonna manufacture
displays you're gonna manufacture a big
old thing like this and you're gonna go
okay here's all the places with defects
that we can't use and you cut around
them essentially so okay if you build a
bigger high-density panel you're going
to lose some yeah but then you build it
into the price exactly
I've always build that into place that's
part of business and then the other
thing is the demand the demand for these
high-density panels is extremely high
you look at something like Nexus 10
where what is a what are the nineteen
twenty by twelve note is it 2560 which
is ridiculous and honestly Tegra 3 is
not fast enough for that and I'm really
excited for like a nexus 10 point two or
something
but ok ok so there's dimin but just
charge more for it
Telus don't even cost that much you
could just take like the screen and
charge you know quadruple what you would
have charged for that screen on the
tablet and I mean if I'm Samsung if I'm
LG if I'm one of these guys that's
actually manufacturing this stuff why
can't
Samsung release a 4k desktop monitor why
are we getting stuff like this beautiful
monitor by the way 1080p why I'm like I
remember watching a video quite a while
ago on YouTube of them like this was
quite a while ago of them showing off
this 4k TV it was a home I guess for K
technology they have one you can't buy
it it's super-exclusive but they have
one why can't we buy it well we can Sony
has a 2500 but like it should be so much
more available and that's the thing is
there what's the manufacturing problem
with with building these large format
displays with higher higher resolution I
don't understand so that was that was
another topic so yes
Linus me is totally an agreement with
Linus Torvalds the other guy you know
the Linux guy you did something once for
technology know what I do is way more
important to him ah hey I'm unboxing the
right so we should have a higher
resolution displays personally okay okay
yeah we'll be locked into DisplayPort I
guess in order to make sure that because
HDMI is like oh yeah 4k support at 24
fps so yeah we'll have to use
DisplayPort
so we need to make sure we have the
interconnects that can work but come on
I mean even that's like DVI dual link
DVI is been around for how long how
complicated is the chip on either end
double it
yeah could you pull it okay 10x it
doesn't matter will you pay an extra
$2.00 for a graphics card if you know it
can drive before Karen 18 if it is right
I mean DisplayPort is even capable of
the bandwidth that we need already so
has it jumping back to your topic we
were talking about earlier with PC games
not being hard enough to run I rode my
480 and have no problems with anything I
crush everything that comes in my way
make me want to upgrade my graphics card
yeah I know like crazy like Crysis 3
star citizen and I hope they do I hope
so but we don't know yet come on what's
up with wow did you just keep upgrading
their information this this brings along
another tile think about Blizzard just
being terrible lately
well like you can't call it come on yeah
well three years old yeah yeah and then
okay like Diablo 3 is like I just kind
of a failure of a release in my opinion
like it okay it's a good game but it's a
blizzard game it should be a
ridiculously good game it shouldn't be a
pretty feeling release like one game
every three years exactly they should
have crushed torchlight I know right it
was awesome
I never played torchlight 2 yet I've
heard it's better it's better and like
they did not crush torchlight
they didn't come close to crushing
torchlight and they should have Wow was
amazing when it was released and some
people would argue that it's no good in
fact x11 now all scary it's old and all
the expansions are just like okay we had
it
we had one release it's like well okay
that's cool but your game is really
freaking old they just have it and like
stock up to the next expansion they just
pushed it back because they're like oh
people realized that we did nothing with
it and said it was gonna be released
this year and we did nothing
we pulled a whole bunch of Units out of
the game we added a few and really good
luck like the what was the original
Starcraft 1 expansion I can't believe
reward Buber was huge she had everything
and it changed the entire balance yeah
different game and it was amazing and
everyone loved it and it was great and
it pushed eSports and it was awesome and
hard a swarm just isn't legal Legends is
dominating eSports right now
Counter Strike is like surviving somehow
I love chemistry but it's really and
like there's so many things destiny of
soccer player no you don't know don't
worry Oh
Destiny's posted something on reddit
though it's really long about everything
that Blizzard should be doing it just
isn't
Blizzard reacted so lately and so
they're gonna change a few other things
but they're just not well they added
higher levels of DirectX like come on
like people keep asking me they're like
oh I am you know I want to play you know
I would I'm upgrading my graphics card
so I can have DirectX 11 and they'll
have like they'll have something good
like they'll have like you know like an
older DirectX 9 I've got like a 7900 GTX
or something and then they'll be
upgrading or like they'll have an 8800
GT or something like that and they'll be
upgrading to like a low-end DirectX 11
card I'm just like you know what DirectX
level is not that more enemy look at
games like Witcher 2 x9 yeah it's a tx9
game it looks better than almost
anything else for the PC with their
super textures especially with their
uber textures in there and honestly I
mean okay I challenge you guys all the
gamers watching this stream right now
and we're on twitch TV so at least a
handful of you better play video games
even though I don't but half of us play
video games he plays video games
riddle me okay I challenge you go find a
game that has DirectX 9 10 and 11
support and do a blind taste test with
yourself get someone to change them
around
and see if you can even tell it's hard
if we play the game though you don't get
to like walk road like this and look at
the textures on the floor you don't get
to do that that's cheating yeah
like it like like I said it's hard you'd
have to do stuff like that to really
knows okay
so that brought us I phones are made it
more environmentally did you know that
right now there is not an efficient
recycling technique for touchscreens
actually but efficient recycling
technique with Sweden thing anyways ok
but for touchscreens yeah there's no
there's no environmentally safe disposal
method for them the problem is the
bonding layer in between the touch
interface and the panel I don't remember
but it means you can't separate them
anymore and apparently this is like a
huge problem and as more and more touch
I mean so many phones yes but now
multiply that times whatever for a
tablet times whatever for a notebook
times whatever for a desktop monitor
because everyone's doing it for Windows
8 all-in-one computers olders
older-style touch screens it wasn't a
problem pressure-sensitive ones like for
POS terminals but it's a really I mean
I'm not really going anywhere with this
but it's just a really interesting thing
to think about I mean on the other hand
when I was a kid tetra Paks were a big
problem because there's no way to
recycling
whereas now every tetra pack is
recyclable because sure we'll come up
with something some guy won some award
for coming up with a way I hope they
come up with something but it's just
something to think about right now guys
so don't buy you know more touchscreens
than you absolutely need if you don't
absolutely need to science will find a
way on the other hand I didn't work at
NCIX so buy lots of new technology here
and stuff ok don't like the s3 it's
plastic you see ah it is plastic he's
done training is with me and I'm not a
huge fan of that either I don't like the
back I wish I had a textured back like
my old Nexus S did oh hey I wanted to
ask you guys um how's the audio levels
tonight cuz I've had complaints in the
past from people watching on mobile
device mobile blah blah mobile devices
or anything like that they're saying
they couldn't turn the audio levels up
enough so I hope it's uh I hope it's
good enough tonight let's check the
other twitch chat
um audio is good crap good create clear
and crisp perfect extremely good better
okay awesome glad to hear it thank you
twitch for letting me know
and we've got a correction Elric was
fired yes we know I think we said he was
gone I don't I I was saying he left but
I was talking about change I'm Logan you
might have I don't know if I might have
said the same thing whatever are you
wearing a teamliquid hoodie yes oh
they're so lame eSports isn't sports I
know I'm on twitch TV right now saying
that it's not gonna make me popular but
it's not sports you know like it cuz
it's but they be prefaced it with some
okay they know they're not like oh
there's no sports no these are not poker
which tries to be a little sport okay
fine that's a lot words they know
they're eSports I don't know
okay hold on I have to log into this so
you can talk more about how to eSports
in the sport I'm not I'm saying it's an
eSport it's it's own little category
they don't try and say like oh we're
runners and I jumpers and football
players they know they're east points
they have their own category I like that
they're not like poker
I hate poker but it's like oh it's a boy
we surround table looking to yeah but
they look at each other really
intentionally yeah no I know and like
and pokers difficult and you can make
money yeah pokers difficult you can make
money it's lunch you can make more money
playing poker than you can doing almost
any other sport other than like you know
NBA
well nothing NHL players are making any
money right now but but they should
differentiate themselves in some way
because it is different so it's a mind
sport or the team lets you just call
themselves in tables well magic choice I
say they're come on Tim that's like
calling Dungeons and Dragons to sport
though it's a table game poker is a game
and eSports aren't games but
whoa that was actually impenetrable go
ahead for a minute the sport cuz they're
all games how is that a sport because
I'm a game football
so you just categorize all of them you
just
apparently Christian they all know
Eclipse thinks you're the handsomest man
on the interwebs I would argue that I
can find someone more heads and then
slick on the internet okay this is kind
of scary handsome man right there
handsomer than slick out on the shaver
okay you don't have a shaver well maybe
that's why your little ruffian horrible
like some kind of homeless person let's
remove them okay let's remember Movember
is about a mustache you just look like a
scrub alright let's find let's find
other men that are more handsome than
slick you know I'm surprised there
aren't more troll pictures here I'm like
not handsome men at all I'm really
surprised
okay that's Ken I'm just happy Justin
Bieber didn't come up there we go
this is more along this is more your
speed I wouldn't I would make that
argument but that is that is more that
is more your speed and we are gonna go
back to Twitter where they are going to
all hardcore agree with me I'm pretty
sure that they are people I'm pretty
sure that we can't Google all right
we're back to Twitter oh top guy alright
we have a question on Twitter from badge
vague let's call him vague vague 93 says
how come mechanical keyboards are so
expensive do you think it's a matter of
time before prices become more
reasonable not necessarily I would say
not ever not at all yeah I don't think
so I don't think that would be cheaper
mechanical keyboards don't really break
down so you don't have the ability to
just buy more all the time like
membrane keyboards but it'll just die
okay look at it this way do cars get
cheaper as a category why steel costs
more than it did last but I think he's
asking in relation to membrane keyboards
no but okay hold on because well no I
think he just says they're so expensive
do you think it's a matter of time
before they come down so steel costs
more last costs more everything costs
more electronics customers are so
spoiled because this is the only product
in the world that actually goes down
we're advancing the technology
inherently makes it cheaper where is
like a car you want to like machine more
valves into an engine like it costs more
mechanical keyboard a mechanical
keyboard there's nothing digital about
it it costs what it costs to build those
key switches
well Kevin no I don't think there's
nothing digital about it I'm talking
about a mechanical key switch okay it's
a mechanical key switch there's okay I
can't believe he's doing he's climbing
in my blinds rocket get down okay so
rocket is joining our livestream which
he doesn't usually do inherently costs
money they are digital yes but like not
the switch and there's nothing that can
make them come down in price because
there's nothing to miniaturize yeah and
it cost want to make them yeah well I
guess he didn't he wasn't saying
innovation so yeah no more no more the
membranes won't come down and with more
people likely going the way law
detective at the g7 10 plus there's all
the features added in I mean the only
reason membrane keyboards came about at
all was because of the way that in
electronics inherently get cheaper as
the computer got cheaper it became less
and less justifiable to include a
keyboard that costs $100 to manufacture
yeah if you're selling a keyboard or a
computer that's $1,000 total as opposed
to $5,000 total wasn't
viable for IBM to make their I mean just
the same way that video cards you know
six seven years ago we're talking you
know ninety-eight hundreds and stuff
like that used to come with a bunch of
games and like a bunch of accessories
and like all this stuff and now they
don't because inherently they were like
okay okay actually graphics cards are a
great example because as the chips get
more efficient and they keep they kept
increasing with die sizes over the years
so they're not getting cheaper in the
same way electronics usually do but
there's a lot of stuff that costs more
on a graphics card no matter what like
power delivery coolers are made of
copper and aluminum which are always
increasing in price so so that's that's
where that that squeeze comes from you
can't include as many value add
peripherals if the thing is gonna always
cost much and that's why if you buy like
a prepackaged crappy computer like an HP
you're gonna get the worst keyboard and
the worst Mouse because they're just
gonna be as cheap as they possibly can
so they can give you functionality and
they know that no one's gonna use it
anyway yeah you know what it comes down
to is nothing is free
yeah no such thing as a free lunch no
such thing as nothing is free if you buy
you know if you buy a car that includes
the undercoating that means they built
it in somewhere else
yeah if you buy a computer that includes
a fantastic mechanical keyboard you pay
for that somewhere you paid for it
somewhere so you know what if anything I
have no problem with stuff just coming
with less and ultimately me being able
to just buy what I actually want as
opposed to buying things I don't need it
that's like the neo eco power splice
Ameritech right like I have bags of
generic power cables I don't need it to
come with a bargain on the other hand
speaking as the person who was the buyer
for those when they came out they
actually didn't drop the costs at all
for me okay so I actually didn't even
get like a $0.10 saving I assumed they
were discounted I don't know however I
think the packaging actually ended up
costing them more because it moved to a
cardboard packaging right but they could
have done that with any part that's what
I'm trying well no but I'm saying the
money that okay I didn't get a discount
on it right because they save money on a
