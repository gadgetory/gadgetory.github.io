fairly unique product this is the asou
so as since st the essence of sound it's
a zone our line of product product and
it features a 124 decibel sound a noise
ratio and a headphone amp so they're
saying this card is for audio files in
here we will find an excellent
presentation for this card and let's go
through some of the main features of it
first of all it does require an external
power connector so that should give you
some idea that this is a either a fairly
high powered card or what they say about
it which is far more likely is the fact
that it offers independent power supply
directly from the PSU for sensitive
analog signals so rather than taking
power from the motherboard where there
can be a lot of interference it takes
power directly from your power supply
awesome ok so use the superior decks it
uses the burr brown PCM 179 to a digital
analog converter which converts signals
at 127 decibels signal-to-noise ratio
excellent ok so that's a feature that
you're going to find over other high
ends even sound cards it has swappable
OPA socket so you can actually tune it
to your unique sound preference
alright built-in headphone amp this is
huge so many sound cards do not have a
headphone amp and so many users are
using headphones or headsets that they
don't even know is not properly driven
by the sound card that they're using for
example the Sennheiser PC 350 s have a
high impedance for a gaming headphone
given that so many gaming cards don't
have a headphone amp so unless you're
using a dedicated app with it you're not
getting the most out of it
next perfectly sealed analog output path
so EMI and copper shielding sealed the
RCA and headphone signals from noise
offering distortion free audio enjoyment
excellent precision clock tuning world's
first sound card with precision clocking
to minimize audio jitter okay hyper
grounding circuitry design utilizing PCB
design separate signal and noise
ensuring only the cleanest signals
possible and ok fine gold professional
audio capacitors ok so basically this
card is built from the ground up to give
you the best possible get this stereo
audio so this is not a multi-channel
sound card it uses either to RCA for
left and right side
or one headphone jack that's it that's
all you can get a add-in daughterboard
that sits next to it that gives you 7.1
audio but this card is all about the
stereo experience so actually here's the
details about the zone rh6 multi-channel
extension board offering 120 decibel
signal to noise ratio Tetra etc the
reality of it is most audio files who
are using very high-end headphones are
using stereo they are not using surround
sound headphones or any of that because
many of them perceive it as as a more of
a gimmicky thing rather than a true
audio experience feature so whether
that's true or not I am NOT the judge
but I'm just giving you the facts so
here we find the card itself and let's
get the accessories go in first here so
here's a little black box that gives us
the accessories first of all we have an
adapter Oh excellent okay so this is an
RCA left and right to normal headphone
adapter because the one that's actually
built into the card is the larger kind
okay then we have oh then we have an
adapter for smaller headphone jack to a
bigger headphone jack thank you for that
then we have oh oh okay this seems to be
some kind of like an optical audio thing
some sort yeah okay okay so that's what
that is some kind of it converts from
the little tiny optical jack to to a
larger one I hope okay audio a precision
test report oh cool so you get the audio
precision test report which shows you
all of the different on noise level
frequency response you know what I have
to confess I know so little about this
stuff that it's making me look kind of
bad right now but what are you gonna do
something about crosstalk dynamic range
very cool well it explains what it all
is excellent okay so they actually tell
you what all of this stuff means so just
because you don't understand what it all
means it doesn't mean you can't be
prepared to get good enjoyment out of
the card here is a big picture of the
card ok
then okay so this is just a little mini
poster gold-plated on the EMI shield the
4,000 years old time of tiger represents
not only mankind's endless pursuit of
the essence of sound but also zone our
essence STX is commitment to offer the
best quality ever from an audio card so
that's the little tiger guy there very
cool about that symbolic miss going on
okay and this is the same poster but in
black just in case you prefer that you
know once you go black you never go back
Quick Start Guide so that's giving you
the basics how to install your card how
to install the drivers awesome thank you
for that then you have the driver CD
don't use this download the latest
drivers off the assist website and that
pretty much does it for the accessories
that are included with this card so why
don't we have a look at the card itself
if I've got to tell you it feels very
high-end here okay so first of all here
we go you've got your front right front
left headphone line in and spit it out
that is all for the for the inputs and
outputs on this sound card it is all
about the stereo experience okay under
this shield you will find the the DAC
which is I believe right there okay so
that's the burr brown DAC right there
and then also the user replaceable op
amps are under there as well
here is Ana sous blah blah blah audio
processing unit you can actually see
this is a fairly simple PCB compared to
some of the more high-end sound cards
that you'd see I mean creative used to
have like firewire joystick ports all
kinds of crazy things on there sound
cards they are not going for that kind
of approach here here you will find the
power input that you will need to
operate this card I'm guessing this is
required partially for the headphone amp
and also like they said to minimize the
amount of interference you're going to
get from taking motherboard power here
is the output I believe for the 7.1
interface now we can go to the top of
the card there is the output for your
front panel audio as well as one of
those CD connectors if anyone still uses
those then we have the back of the card
you can see this is a PCI card rather
than a PCI Express card I'm not sure
what the reasoning is for that but it is
a slightly older cards that could be why
and thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the essence
