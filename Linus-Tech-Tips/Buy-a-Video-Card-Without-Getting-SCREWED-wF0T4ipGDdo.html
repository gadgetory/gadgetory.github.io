to think of it when was the last time I
actually bought a GPU I think it was I
think it was during the last scrap yard
wars you know maybe it's finally time to
expand the collection you know I'm gonna
go I'm gonna get caught up on street
pricing here and get some new GPUs wait
I'm sorry what 10 80s are going for 850
to eleven hundred and fifty bucks ten
seventy TI is it 732 975 Vega 56 s for
just under to over a thousand dollars
holy crap I mean there are cards out
there going for almost a thousand
Canadian rubles that we declared not a
great value at about half of that when
they were released who so thankfully I
don't actually need a GPU that badly
that whole thing was just a setup for
this video well no but there are a lot
of folks out there who do so for you we
compiled a few tips and tricks to help
you try and get a decent deal so you can
get your game on
speaking of a decent deal I fix it
I fix its protec toolkit gives you the
tools you need to tackle any electronics
repair challenge visit ifixit.com slash
linus at the link below and get yours
today
so this video is gonna be a little bit
different from our standard fare no
performance graphs no sexy b-roll I
probably won't even drop anything except
some mad truths
we'll start our journey at the local
level this is memory Express whose
website even has a special notice on it
about a GPU and power supply shortage
because believe it or not retailers have
been frustrated by the lack of supply -
with that said it's not all bad news
there's a very recent update on their
site about restrictions being lifted on
graphics card purchases so there may be
some light at the end of the tunnel if
that's any indication and did anyone
actually realize that there was an
ongoing power supply shortage anyway
this still doesn't tell us when prices
will actually stabilize so if you don't
want to wait weeks or potentially even
months to upgrade your potato for a game
of fortnight we may need some other
options so if nothing else by looking at
retail pricing we can get a baseline for
what to look for when we compare the
launch price with the lowest price
available on PC par picker we see a
couple of obvious patterns here the most
expensive GPUs have the biggest markup
which we might expect but we also see
something peculiar the GeForce GTX 1080
is by far the closest to its MSRP and
I'd even go as far as to say if you can
find one at about this pricing go ahead
and buy retail if you can another while
you can tip by the way is that sometimes
vendors will sell directly at MSRP take
Nvidia for example where you can buy
founders edition cards for way less as
long as you are diligently monitoring
their site and you're quick on the draw
next we've got used sites like
Craigslist which are currently
overflowing with second-hand GPUs and
prices are trending
downward overall which you know what let
me see that thing actually forget it
this is ridiculous you can get deals now
yeah but scalpers like this are all over
the place often asking close to or even
more than retail for never used or
lightly used cards so just make sure you
keep your BS detectors cranks 2:11 until
this blows over
but if buying directly at retail is
expensive and current-gen used cards are
going to be a minefield for a while what
else can we do well some retailers are
actually offering combo deals with steep
discounts for graphics cards that are
usually bundled with some other
component that gamers would want like a
headset a high-end CPU or motherboard
that kind of thing and while our luck at
Newegg today wasn't great with just 10
to $20 savings being typical some
vendors like microsensor are doing in
store only discounts with limited
quantities available with that said
though maybe we're barking up the wrong
tree maybe what we want isn't a specific
graphics card but rather a specific
performance level and I think I know how
we can achieve that we're gonna go where
the miners aren't going we know that the
GTX 1080 is in most cases about 25
percent faster than the previous
generation 980ti
however if we look at the price for the
980ti somewhere like eBay it's cheaper
then even the cheapest 1070 I mean and
compared to the 1080 I'm talking like
just over half the price and the HBM
equipped fury ax can be had for a
similar price - as long as 4 gigs is
enough theorem for you and you have the
power supply to run it and so you know
moving down in the pricing tiers a
little bit if you were after an rx 580
or 570 the performance difference
between the 480 and
or 70 is so minimal that the price
difference here makes that a no-brainer
as well and depending on your needs you
can even go further back like a Maxwell
tight necks or tighten black or even as
far back as a GTX 680 or Radeon HD 7970
if your goal is 1080p gaming those
things are around a hundred bucks today
about half that of a 1050 TI with
slightly better performance do note
though that older high-end cards like
The Fury will draw more power and lack
new features like HDMI 2.0 a TVC HDR and
they have no hope of playing back
content protected by PlayReady 3.0 DRM
and you also don't get a warranty when
you do this well not usually anyway so
buyer beware there but games don't stop
to wait for GPU prices to drop and if
you need the horsepower this seems to be
the best way to go until the whole
industry regains its senses unplug and
play what does that even mean I'll tell
you it's Corsairs line up of wireless
gaming peripherals including their dark
core RGB se Mouse which features one
millisecond 2.4 gigahertz and low
latency Bluetooth connectivity there k63
wireless gaming keyboard with the same
low latency connection options and
Cherry MX red switches with a blue
backlight and their mm 1000 which is a
wireless charging mouse pad though it
should be noted that the wireless
charging version of the mouse will work
with any qi wireless charging pad not
just theirs which is pretty cool and you
can check out the whole lineup at the
links below no I made it so thanks for
watching guys if this video sucked you
know what to do but if it was awesome
get subscribed hit that like button or
maybe check out where to buy the stuff
we featured on eBay I guess at the link
in the video description also linked
down there's our merch store which has
cool shirts like this one and our
community forum which you should totally
