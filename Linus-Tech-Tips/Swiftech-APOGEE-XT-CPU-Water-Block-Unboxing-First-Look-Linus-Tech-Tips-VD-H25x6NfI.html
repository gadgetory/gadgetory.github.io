a revision to from Swift tech there's a
very good reason I am unboxing this
particular little piece of water-cooling
gear and that is because I will be using
it for my ultimate liquid-cooled machine
build guide which will include a liquid
cooling component so I'm gonna go ahead
and take everything out of the box and
show you guys exactly what it comes with
so the first thing we find is a couple
of 1/2 inch beautiful plated G 1/4
barbed fittings there you go so those
are four half inch tubing alright next
we have some thermal compound that is
Arctic silver ceramic if it's still the
same thing it was years ago which is
exactly what it looks like a very good
quality thermal compound not the best
but certainly far from the worst and
non-conductive non capacitive very safe
for use in your system here we have a
couple of black worm drive clamps so you
put your tubing over the Barb you put
the worm drive clamp over the tubing
then you tighten it up with a slot head
screwdriver to make sure you got a nice
tight seal in there can you see that
okay yes you can all right next we have
an install guide which is so easy with
this particular glockl that does show
you a couple of interesting little
things Oh
critical ok the water block side with
the three screws must be parallel to the
CPU locking leader fascinating that's
probably just for maximum performance it
might you know cost you a degree or two
if you don't do it that way but
fascinating okay so will bear that in
mind right so let's have a look at the
Oh No okay we've got an extra backplate
so my assumption is that's an 11 56 pack
weight and the one that is pre-installed
here on the CPU block is actually a 1366
backplate so let's go ahead and yeah you
peel that off for sure and I'll just
take this apart a little bit before I
try to show it to you Wow
water blocks have come a long way since
I got my last water block upgrade which
was actually quite a little while ago
this one looks just gorgeous
all right and so Swift Tech has really
upgraded their mounting hardware systems
since the last time I installed a new
block as well this thing is like rugged
okay so there's your two back plates as
I guessed yes this is the 1366 the only
difference is just the spacing of the
holes and you can actually see that
Swift Tech has designed this particular
block to easily slide back and forth so
you can install it on 775 1155 1156 and
1366 you can remove those Stoppers and
then you can take these off but really
there's no need to unless you are going
to replace the hold-down now as they
mentioned the side with three here is
going to be the side that you want to
align with your with your CPU a
retention arm okay so let's talk about
the features of this particular block a
little bit so this is the Apogee XT
which is the successor to every other
Apogee block my actual my first water
block was actually an Apogee the
original Apogee and like its
predecessors it uses a pin matrix so you
can see down into the block itself now
it's a much tighter pin matrix than it
used to be the apogee had pins that were
probably oh wow they must have been
about six seven times the size of those
the apogee GT improved on that and then
here we are with the XT so you can see
actually what's really cool about this
block is that it does have a central
Inlet which is a design that came in
fashion about three three four years ago
and that's not all you also have the
option of taking the central inlet and
turning it around so that the one so
your inlet is here remember the inlet is
the one where the water goes in so go
ahead I'll put the barbs on here for
demonstration so the water goes in
directly over your CPU core and then
leader flows around inside the block
cooling itself
well not cooling itself heating itself
cooling the CPU and then comes out the
outlet but what you can do if you're not
quite as worried about flow rate and
honestly I've never been much of a flow
rate guy I mean yes it makes a slight
difference to the performance of a given
water cooling system but it's not the
end of the world what you can do is you
can use an allen key to take out these
six guys right here you can turn this
around and then you can actually move
the inlet over to this side which allows
you to not only install these barb
fittings but you can also install
compression fittings instead because
you'll have that extra clearance so
that's that's a really convenient
feature alright so I want to show you
guys the hold-down mechanism Swift Tech
has always taken hold downs very very
seriously they were one of the first
ones well actually they were the only
ones for the longest time to even have
an Intel approved hold down in terms of
the amount of mounting pressure that it
was applying to the CPU and in terms of
the convenience that it applies to users
they have made great strides compared to
their competition over the years so I'm
just going to go ahead and show you how
this works first thing you're gonna do
is you're gonna peel off the plastic
covering and let's just do the finger
test so you can see it's very shiny very
shiny indeed okay and then I'm just
gonna put that back on to protect the
base because I'm not really ready to
install it right now there we go peel
off put back on wax on wax off all right
and then what you do is you put this on
the back of your board you take off
those adhesive pads there stick it to
the back of your board and the right
positioning and then you screw these in
now what Swift tech has done so well
since very early days is implemented
Stoppers
so what Stoppers do is unlike their
competitors like I said the mounting
pressure being within Intel spec Swift
tech actually puts in place a maximum
here so you can see we screwed it in all
the way it doesn't go in any further
your spring controls the amount of
tension that there is the amount of
pressure there is on your CPU and that
is how Swift tech prevents you from over
tightening and bowing your motherboard
which used to be a big concern a few
years back when not everyone was
including back plates with their CPU
blocks so really what it comes down to
for me in choosing the aqua GXT is that
I wanted something that was very very
easy very robust to mount and I wanted
something that offered top cooling
performance so
this little guy hits both of those marks
no problem thank you for checking out my
unboxing and don't forget to subscribe
to my NCI x-column channel as well as
this channel so you can check out the
ultimate build guide including a water
cooling guide section</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
