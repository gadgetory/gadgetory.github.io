many requests to do over the years that
this practice has been I don't want to
say commonplace but definitely something
that enthusiasts have been doing and I
am finally finally going to set aside my
concerns about not really wanting people
to do this because it can definitely
break your cpu and will definitely void
your warranty and I will be showing you
guys how to remove the integrated heat
spreader or IHS on an Intel Core i7 6700
K
Tunnel bear is the easy-to-use VPN
service that lets you use the web as
though you are in one of the 20
different countries learn more and
Tritonal bear for free at the link in
the video description so I think a
natural question to ask is why on earth
would you want to remove that that metal
pop that could protects the die of the
processor well the reasons have varied
from year to year so in the olden days
it was so that we could actually mount
the heatsink directly to the die
eliminating that small thermal
resistance that is caused by the IHS
itself but in recent years starting I
think it was particularly with has well
it's become more because intel has used
not the greatest thermal compound to
attach the IHS to the die itself rather
than soldering them together so what
that worse thermal compound means is
that your cooling performance can be
affected by that goop so what people
have been doing is instead of leaving
the IHS off they've actually been going
as far as to put the IHS back on and
just replace the thermal compound so
that's what we're going to be doing
today and we're going to find out if it
makes a difference so to start with
we'll need a baseline so we're gonna
take our 6700 K we've just got some z170
board from MSI going on here and other
than that this is kind of a Genki test
bench and Wow I applied a lot of thermal
compound but that's okay as long as I do
it the same way the second time then we
are freakin golden so we're just using a
stock heatsink I don't want to sit
around and wait for water to warm up and
reach equilibrium or whatever else and
frankly that doesn't matter to get the
results that we need because we are
looking for an improvement in
temperatures not an absolute value let's
go ahead and get that puppy mounted
there we go
snapped in place we're going to fire
this up and then get i-264 going to find
out exactly what our baseline reading is
benchmarking break that was a long Pizza
break it is actually the next day I got
busy I had to do
so whatever you guys don't care about my
excuses but you care about his results
and right here we've had our test
running for about 20 minutes and it's
running at 70 degrees Celsius here so
that gives us a really good before
scenario well before we rip that baby
apart
all right so step one we're gonna pull
the CPU off of our test bench here put
that aside next and this is for the sake
of keeping my hands clean not because
it's a hazard to the CPU we're going to
go ahead and clean off that thermal
compound don't worry we'll be reapplying
it later one handy thing about doing
this test on this CPU one that's had
thermal compound applied and cleaned off
of it many times is that we're
effectively working with a pre polished
IHS so that's another thing that people
do sometimes to get slightly better
performance now with some previous
generation CPUs and I've encountered
this before there were surface mount
components much like you see here on the
top of the package which meant you had
to be extremely careful as you were
cutting in between the substrate and the
IHS but that's not the case with skylake
making it actually surprisingly easy so
you start with the corners I'm a good
gap in that one we will try a slightly
different approach holy crap all of that
is tight all right I think I got it I
just need to get the CPU flat make sure
that I get under the metal here once it
starts to cut it'll cut pretty fast
there we go see that okay so the
adhesive is starting to come starting to
come loose we're going to do all four
corners just like that I really don't
want to slice my handle
these would suck so once we've done the
corners we're going to go ahead and do
the edges don't cut too deep it's really
not that much adhesive all right
mmm rock on so it looks like we are
right-side up with the notches at the
top we're going to clean the adhesive
residue the seal here off of both sides
then we are going to clean off that
thermal compound and replace it with
something else now I'm just going to use
some maker gel but I have lying around
but what a lot of people are doing is
they're using like the lip that liquid
metal stuff or whatever else to get the
utmost in performance and then they're
actually using an adhesive like a
thermal adhesive to glue these pieces
back together I'm just going to be going
with the floating method where you don't
actually glue them back together I'm
just going to be doing a Tim swap I just
thermal interface material to find out
just how bad the stock stuff is let's
put some aftermarket grade thermal Wow
so much fail all right I gotta clean
this again we'll be back in a moment
let's try that again this time holding
down the CPU
and putting less thermal compound that's
logs check our orientation there we go
and so let's find out if she works now
because I didn't glue down the IHS I do
have to be pretty careful in my
installation here throw that baby in
there like that
so one tricky bit as we lower the
retention arm as you can see these wings
right here sit on the integrated heat
spreader the IHS so we're going to need
to compensate by moving it a little bit
further back before we tighten this baby
down so that it sits in the correct
position once the arms are locked just
like that so now we're going to reapply
our thermal compound again going a
little bit heavy putting a little bit
more than I normally would like I did
last time put our stock heatsink back on
and let's fire up a stress test shall we
my jabroni x' that's right I am full of
dated words see if it works yeah alright
that's the first step in success when it
comes to trying to improve something not
making it worse or breaking it boom
let's let her run until she reaches max
temperature and we will come back so
here we are my friends the stunning
conclusion it's hovering anywhere from
about 66 to about 68 degrees we'll call
that 67 so there you have it friends
that is ultimately why I have never
really condoned the removal of
integrated heat spreaders because while
you do get a couple of degrees and if
you were using a better pace you get a
couple more degrees what you do not get
is enough for it to make any kind of
significant difference to your overclock
or the lifespan of your chip if you're
using air
or water cooling so I don't recommend
doing it because I don't feel like it is
worth the risk of damaging the CPU or
the voiding of the warranty of your CPU
so we've got Tesoro here with a pretty
freakin awesome giveaway we've got three
