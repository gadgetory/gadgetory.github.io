to you by HyperX gaming products make
sure you click their logo to check out
the great gaming content on their
YouTube channel as well as phantom glass
the ultimate gorilla glass screen
protector for your mobile device it is
x99 overload here in the Intel booth
everybody has systems featuring the new
59 60 X 8 Core Extreme Edition hyper
threaded turbo boosts processor but we
kind of figured well there's so much
stuff on display here maybe we should
narrow it down to the coolest systems
that we found with this new processor
technology so starting with this one
right here from Falcon Northwest which
has a custom name plate that says packs
so you either they built the system last
year and they've had samples for over a
year
not likely or they built the system just
to bring to the show here so it features
a custom red automotive grade paint job
it's got a custom case that was you can
tell from the drive cages here they
collaborated with Silverstone on it so
it's their design however it's got that
Silverstone quality to it they're using
a Silverstone power supply to go along
with it they've got a couple of suits
graphics cards it should be noted this
is a powered by AC system they are a
member of that exclusive club and this
is a really interesting feature so aside
from liquid cooling for the CPU they go
air cooling on the GPUs but with this
shroud right here that leads from what I
believe is a 180 millimeter fan down
here on the bottom and that's one of
Silverstone's air penetrator fans
designed to really direct air flow up
they've got both of these cards running
in their own separate wind tunnel that
Falken tells me can achieve up to 15
degree different temperatures compared
to the CPU compartment that means you're
keeping your GPU heat away from
everything else and well out of your
system where you do not want it actually
I don't know how exclusive the powered
by Asus Club is it looks like they're
letting just about anyone into it these
days here's a system from NCIX I'm just
teasing you guys it's actually a pretty
sick system it's built in the Corsair
760 t and it features a liquid cooling
setup that I am personally quite
fond of this is Swift tax all-in-one
liquid cooler that comes out of the box
ready to be installed so you could just
buy one of these from Instax and throw
it in your computer liquid cool your cpu
or what's really cool about is it can be
expanded so it comes with this triple
120 millimeter radiator that's in here
and the CPU block which also includes a
pump but it has been expanded in this
case to include a front dual 120
millimeter radiator as well as 2 ek a
water blocks cooled GTX 780 direct si
YouTube cards from as seuss you can also
see that they have upgraded the stock
look of this particular case this is a
Corsair 760 T with a suite a soos
powered by Zeus ro G deck leafing that
looks resplendent with the red LED
lighting inside definitely one of our
top picks but this one is water-cooled
on a whole other level you can hardly
even recognize the Corsair 900 d case
that main gear transformed into this
wonderful beautiful beast so ok yes it's
got x99 motherboard of extreme edition
etc ok it also has 2 r9 295x2 so that's
a quad GPU setup but check this out they
don't even take up that much space on
the rampage 5 extreme motherboard you
can actually install other things in
there and you don't have to have the you
know pre-attached liquid coolers because
this whole thing is completely custom
done out up here in the top we've got a
triple 140 millimeter radiator with a
custom shroud down here in the bottom we
have a quadruple 120 millimeter radiator
with a custom shroud they have
customized the fans by cleverly putting
main gear stickers on them but actually
they're a bit of a custom deal e from
Corsair definitely a nice performing fan
and it looks nice too with that white
LED lighting but guys this is all about
the liquid cooling aside from radiators
there has got to be based on my rough
ballpark estimate at least a hundred and
fifty dollars worth of fittings
in this liquid cooling setup and that
leaves aside the you know quick stopping
bells in the bottom so in case one of
your dual pumps dies you can actually
keep running the system that ignores the
custom reservoir dual pump unit that ek
built for them in order to even make it
so that it can run dual pumps and it
ignores the absolute beauty of that 3/8
inch thin wall tubing that they've got
running in these extremely tidy straight
runs all over the system for a bit of an
automotive internals inspired look to it
overall is it cheap no don't be stupid
is it beautiful yeah now let's wrap
things up with the Alienware area51
they are really dug hard to find a
unique name for this system that's
different from all the names of all of
their other systems that was a joke
that was sarcasm but what they did dig
for was a case design that is unlike
anything else that I have ever seen
before so at the front it's got kind of
this angular intakes optical drive front
i/o thing with custom lighting going on
and at the back it is similarly angled
in a way that is actually kind of smart
because whether your systems on the
floor or on your desk there's probably a
wall behind it and this makes it a
little bit easier to reach the rear i/o
they had to go with a bit of an unusual
internal structure check that out the
lighting on the side turns off when you
unplug it or when you disconnect it
there we go and that's what the
motherboard mounted and kind of like I
don't know 30 degree angle or something
like that so of course it's powered by X
99 and all that good stuff but this is
very very very strange to me they've got
a modular power supply in here of course
you're gonna have support for 3-way or
yeah it looks like 3-way if this is the
motherboard they're using up to 3-way
graphics card configurations the one
thing I would worry about here is
whether or not we're trading convenience
for potentially shorter lifespans for
the fans because mounting a fan at an
angle versus straight up and down or
horizontal depending on the bearing
type can be a bit of an issue one thing
I will say is they are using extremely
high static pressure fans and spinning
at a nice low rpm so the system does
remain quite quiet in spite of the
powerful hardware inside that's actually
being used by this game streamer right
here so guys thanks for checking out our
best x99 core i7 xtreme 59 60 X fourth
generation new we're just gonna call it
as well EE extreme edition thanks for
checking out our coverage of the top
systems here in the Intel booth don't
miss any of our PAX Prime 2014 coverage
and a big thanks to our sponsors for
bringing us here HyperX you guys are
awesome check out their YouTube channel
they've got lots of great gaming content
on there right now it's not just the
usual like oh here's some like memory
it's going like no it's actually a lot
better than that and also a big
shout-out to phantom glass for powering
our trip here as well they make
fantastic gorilla glass screen
protectors for your phone it's actually
made of the same material as the screen
of your phone so even if you were to
shatter it you could replace it with a
brand new one it's got that same tactile
feel and responsiveness so thanks to
both of you guys for making it possible
for us to be here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
