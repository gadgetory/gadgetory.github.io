unboxing the Seuss P 7 p 55 D Evo now
the Evo board is positioned a little bit
above the pro level board I mean they've
got a lot of p55 boards it took me a
little while to figure out what the
differences between this and the pro
board so you've got a full + 2 phase
power design SLI and crossfire 100%
Japanese main capacitors okay so that's
all fairly standard now one thing I
noticed is in addition to the
productivity and Trenton games they've
got a little server logo here so that's
not on the pro board okay so let's get
this opened up we've got a pretty
similar accessory package we've got a
black IO shield then we've got your USB
and eSATA then we've got four SATA
cables to straight to right angle an IDE
cable that cute connector there and then
we've got an SLI bridge last but not
least of course is your manual as well
as your driver and utilities DVD ok so
let's get this board out of the box if I
could just yeah so it looks a lot like
most of their other p55 board so you can
see here let's start with the general
layout we've got support for two PCI
Express 16x slots at 8 X 8 X 4 SLI and
crossfire operation this one runs at 4x
electrical so then we've got the AR
chipset here it's cooled by their
stylish new heatsink then we've got 8
SATA ports so four of them are in the
right ankle position for coming straight
out of the board now I did notice that
and I'm gonna get the camera camera lady
today actually to have a look from more
of a distance so you can see we've got
an extra SATA port versus the pro board
we've got extra power and reset switches
on board versus the pro board and that
seems to be for the most part a big part
of the difference oh yeah we've got
another Gigabit Ethernet on the back but
we'll show that later ok so you've got
your power connectors in there desirable
places 24 pin on the right-hand edge and
then your 8 pin connector with the
little cover on it up here at the top
left and then you've got your CPU socket
right in the middle lots of room around
it with the 12 + 2 phase power design
support for dual channel ddr3 as with
all p55 boards now let's have oh this is
something that's really cool about this
board actually is that you can see that
almost all of your on board fan headers
are not really old I'm okay well you've
got a couple PWM ready on board fan
headers so let's have a look at the back
i/o see you can see here you got your
ps2 you got a clear CMOS button Oh
actually the pro board does not have a
clear CMOS button awesome there's
another difference so then you've got
eight USB ports you've got your digital
audio out two Gigabit Ethernet again the
pro board that only has one you've got
firewire eSATA and 7.1 audio so thank
you for checking out my blog on the p7p
55 D Evo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
