from Western Digital now it's not quite
there fastest this is a WD caviar blue
series drive their fastest consumer
level 7200 rpm drives are actually their
black series of drives but it does
include the latest technologies in that
hold on a second I'm doing the unboxing
portion of the video now it is now
unboxed do not eat this please okay oh
hold on
where'd it go where'd the information go
oh the information was actually on this
label aha okay so the NCIX label tells
us that you can ever focus on it no over
here thank you okay so this is a Western
Digital WD caviar blue one terabyte SATA
6 gigabits per second 7200 rpm Drive so
this ordinary-looking SATA interface
back here this is a regular SATA power
but this is not an ordinary SATA
interface this is not SATA one not say
to do but actually say two three six
gigabit per second capable drive now
what this means for performance is
probably not a whole lot but if you do
want to plug it into your SATA 6
gigabits per second motherboard and that
will be satisfying to you then you can
buy this SATA 6 gigabits per second hard
drive and that will be satisfying to you
now in the event that you do have any
difficulty running this drive on a SATA
3 gigabit per second that is SATA to
three gigabit per second port you can
actually jumper pins 5 and 6 so that is
these two here five and six okay and you
can jumper those two ports in order to
limit it to three gigabit per second and
that should increase compatibility now
also bear in mind about this drive is
that another one of the ways it is
advanced is the fact that it uses
advanced format so advanced for Matt
drives require additional installation
steps please check your drive label to
determine if your drive has advanced for
and hold on a minute I don't actually
know if this is an advanced format drive
so it turns out that yes this is indeed
an advanced format drive so what you'll
want to do is make sure you go to the
please focus focus there you go here's
the head focus on the head so make sure
that you go to the looks like the
instructions are actually covered by
this label which is awesome whatever if
you go to the Western Digital website
will walk you through all of the
additional things you may need to do a
hot WDC dot-com flash ad DV format
advanced format and that will tell you
what you need to do to make sure that
your drive is running 100% so thank you
for checking out my unboxing and first
look at the WD caviar blue SATA 3 6
gigabit per second dry and don't forget
to subscribe to Linus tech tips for more
unboxings reviews and others computer
videos don't need this Lucas focus focus
aha there we go don't eat it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
