ever camera review the a7 s mark - like
the original this camera has at many in
the video community talking but does it
stack up to the current camera market
before I go any further this camera has
stills features but I will be tackling
this review from a video perspective the
original a7s hit the market along with
the gh4 about a year ago the a7s stole
the hearts of many shooters with its
unbelievable ability to nearly see in
the dark the mark 2 looks to add some
functionality while maintaining what
everyone loved about the mark 1 the body
of the camera is very similar to the
original design with only a slightly
larger side grip and a few more buttons
the record button is unfortunately still
on the far right of the camera above the
SD card door and is as awkward to press
as ever you can however remap it to
almost any other button on the camera so
it becomes much less of an issue in the
Box notably you get two batteries which
is nice since the a7s chews through
power lasting about two to three hours
of shooting per battery going a step
further sonia's again included the
ability to power the camera off of a USB
battery bank as long as you have a
battery in the camera a feature I will
definitely be taking advantage of during
long shoot days at events like CES the
display on the a7s2 composes of a 1.2
million dot 3-inch screen and a 2.3
million dot electronic viewfinder the
three inch display is reasonably bright
but with a couple of issues first off
the mechanism for how the monitor
articulates which sony has still not
changed since they got into the
mirrorless camera market is not
incredibly useful
it simply tilts up or down and has very
insignificant trouble I found it
particularly annoying when using it on
our tripod at its highest height making
it very difficult for someone at my
height to see the shot easily coming off
of a year of shooting with the gh4 which
has many more position options for its
display this took some adjusting on my
part the EVF on the a7 s2 is very solid
and using it as another point of contact
when shooting handheld what this camera
is great until we get into the biggest
issue with both displays on the a7 s to
focus the punch in to check focus and
peaking on the a7 s two are the worst I
have ever used on any camera especially
of this caliber is incredibly soft punch
all the way in and gives very little
confidence for critical focus
particularly when you're in fast-moving
situations the peaking is passable but
isn't particularly useful on such a
small display even on the lower
setting if you are the type of person
who often shoots events or fast-paced
documentary work I would recommend a
small and light monitor to add to your
rig to combat this issue let's get into
the a7s2 s improved autofocus system I
tested it while walking around the
office and the results are disappointing
the autofocus seems to be a bit slow to
react and with the lens I tested Sony's
16 35-millimeter f/4 there was weird
micro jitter that renders the shot
unusable it's possible the performance
issue is due to the lens however that
does not give me very much confidence
trust the autofocus system in most
situations but your mileage may vary
so what makes this camera so special dat
sensor the a7s2 sports an effective 12.2
megapixel full-frame sensor that has
stolen the title of low-light King from
every other camera on the market so to
see proof for myself I went down to
Vancouver's Olympic Village to test out
the low-light here's a shot of some
large steps near the area with what my
eyes could see now here's what I could
see with the camera what sorcery is this
here's another example of what my eyes
can see and what the camera can see now
you might be thinking that's great I'll
never have to use lights for videos
again this camera can basically see in
the dark let me stop you right there the
point of having the ability to use such
high ISOs on a camera like this is not
simply to crank your ISO to get the
exposure for your shot but to really
take advantage of the control you have
over your depth of field you no longer
have to expose your shots at F 1.4 with
a razor-thin depth of field for night
shots to me that is the most powerful
part of the low-light ability of this
camera you can really think about how
shallow or deep you want your focus and
for those of you working in narrative
your focus puller will thank you the
second party trick this camera has is
Sony's new in sensor 5 axis
stabilization which again I tested on a
swegway and I was really surprised with
the result
this shot feels to me like it might have
been done on a three axis gimbal but it
was simply me holding the camera while
riding forward for comparison here's a
very similar shot with the stabilization
this feature is a great addition but
again to truly take advantage of it you
really need to have email lenses
arguably the most wanted improvement
over the mark one is internal 4k which
this camera can do at 30 fps and 24 fps
in the xav cs codec at either 100 or 60
megabits per second this is a very
welcomed addition since it will give you
a bit more wiggle room when reframing
shots in post comparing it to the 1080p
honestly the difference especially when
down scaling before K to 1080p is
relatively minor you can however see the
difference when zoomed in all the way at
400% the last of the recording modes is
Sony's two flavors of slow motion you
have the option of 120 fps at 100 or 60
megabits per second which will need to
be conformed to your desired frame rate
in post the admittedly more
consumer-friendly option is to have the
footage slowed down for you in camera
however I do not recommend this for pro
use since the footage is fairly noisy
and soft so in conclusion the a7s mark
ii is basically everything you could ask
for in a small form-factor camera if you
can work around the relatively minor
issues that I mentioned before as well
as other little things like not being
able to control monitor brightness while
shooting 4k and not be able to custom
white balance well and manual exposure
really Sony you'll be looking at one of
the best small form-factor cameras on
the market and going forward this will
be the main camera I used to do b-roll
