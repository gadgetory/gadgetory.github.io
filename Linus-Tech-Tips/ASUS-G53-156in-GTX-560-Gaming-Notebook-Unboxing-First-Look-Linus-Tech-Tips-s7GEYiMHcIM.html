a gaming grade notebook from a soos this
is the I can never remember their model
number so I'm just gonna let you guys
read it with me this is the G 53 s X D H
71 so this is a 15.6 inch gaming
notebook it's got 12 gigs of RAM
it's got a Core i7 quad core processor
it comes with a two-year global warranty
including one year of accidental damage
protection includes a bag which I didn't
know but that would explain why the box
is huge
so there's your Republic of gamers
backpack which is actually not that bad
okay one of those and it also includes
look at this a notebook inside as well
and there's a very specific reason that
I'm going to be having a look at this
particular notebook and that is because
isus and I don't you know don't want to
criticize them or anything but a sue
seems to feel in their gaming notebook
line that a gtx 560 m is good enough
because they don't have anything with
the gtx 570 or a GTX 580 M so what I'm
gonna be doing is I'm gonna be taking
this 15 inch notebook and I'm gonna be
putting it head-to-head on my NCIX tech
tips channel against a core i5 so that's
a dual core whereas this one has a quad
core a core i5 less ram but otherwise
similarly SPECT configuration from one
of their competitors with a GTX 580 so
what we're gonna find out by comparing
these two notebooks is what do gamers
really need and they're getting them do
they need higher-end CPUs and lots of
RAM or do they just need the the most
beast graphics possible and then go from
there so we got some screws an LCD
cleaning cloth notebook user manual only
probably got something here about your
warranty there's also some Logitech
thing yet notebook warranty there you
got your
and whatnots on disk Wow look at that
comes with a G 300 well where is it
there it is look at that comes with a
Logitech G 300 mouse - that is a beast
package so they've definitely got the
whole like package thing going on here I
mean not that I'm saying that you know
they are up like a package which could
be perceived as good or bad depending on
like what you want
so notebooks 15.6 inch ones okay sorry
sorry I'm calm down I'm calm down okay
we got the power brick which I'm gonna
do the obligatory iPhones comparison
I'll let's uh let's lick have a look at
that over there just don't get the
package package shot going we try to
maintain a professional demeanor on this
channel you guys you try we fail okay
there's your battery battery is kind of
big but it doesn't really matter because
it's there's notebook and the notebook
is also kind of big so it is what it is
okay there's your cord so now let's have
a look at the notebook itself I've
already talked a fair bit about the
specs so I'm not gonna really get into
that too much more here I'm gonna show
you the battery installation it goes a
little something like that and the thing
about asu's G Series is they have a
gorgeous rubberized finish that is a
fingerprint resistant and be also
slightly more durable than your typical
glossy notebook which tries to be crazy
can't stand glossy notebooks because as
soon as you take like fabric and go like
this it's like oh it's covered in micro
scratches awesome so this is this is
outstanding I love the finish on their D
Series notebooks they've got a matte
screen which is also awesome because you
see some of their competitors using
glossy screens on their gaming notebooks
ah gamers won't know the difference TN
panel glossy screen they'll think it's
great you know what no I prefer matte
screen especially
for a high-end notebook like this is
this not a cheap notebook this is well
over $1,000 so you definitely want to
see things like the accidental damage
protection as well as matte screens
high-end specs and overall good build
quality one thing that I would
potentially criticize about it is it has
a lot of depth so you can see out here
there's a lot of extra sort of baggage
and that's where it's carrying the
battery so just bear that in mind guys
you're going to need a little bit of a
bigger desk in order to accommodate one
of these guys but if you're buying a
high-end gaming notebook hopefully you
knew that already so you got your
headphone port your microphone port you
got USB to USB 3 HDMI VGA ethernet and
power in this is a good mix I still like
to see VGA ports on notebooks you've got
a fairly average sized touchpad keys are
soft and quiet but not too soft ok it's
got a full number pad nothing stupid as
far as the keyboard layout is concerned
we got full-size backspace shifts and
enters so nothing really bothersome over
there
let's go ahead this is backlit to your
stick yeah illuminated chiclet keyboards
what else we got on here improve cooling
stability reduce noise aha okay we'll
have a look at that at the back and the
soft touch I've talked about that
already
but the palm rest is also using soft
touch mention 12 gigs of ram already ok
over here we've got a DVD drive as well
as a couple more USB to ports hardware
buttons for your your lights as well as
your ik locking and something to do with
Republic of gamers and all likelihood
based on the logo uh here we go no
that's not it oh cool so that's a level
up so that's an overclocking button very
cool you can just overclock your cpu
using the one button ok so on the back
these are for ventilation so that is why
we have so much space over here I guess
so that they have room for the beast
fans that they're going to be using to
cool this bad boy so like I said the
comparison that's coming is going to be
this versus the GTX 580 model seeing how
they stack up against each other do we
need bigger CPUs do we need bigger GPUs
how much of a value is there to buying a
notebook with a super-powerful graphics
card
where power does it consume when you're
gaming all this kind of stuff is going
to be very interesting so thank you for
checking out my unboxing and first look
at the g-53 so we'll just call it the
g53 because it's basically a shell you
can get in a lot of different
configurations don't forget to subscribe
