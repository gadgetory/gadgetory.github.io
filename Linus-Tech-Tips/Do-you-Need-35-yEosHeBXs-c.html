shout-out to Squarespace thanks for
allowing us to be here at CES 2016 so
we're here in the Silverstone suite and
we're gonna start with the cases we're
gonna have to run through these pretty
quickly because they've got a fair
amount on display as usual so we'll
start with the ml o 8 and the R v02 they
actually feature the same internal
structure with the main difference being
the design of the front fascia so what
they've done with these puppies is
they've gone ahead and abandoned yes my
friends they have abandoned three and a
half inch drives so they're assuming
you've either got an AZ or you've got a
two and a half inch storage drive and
that's pretty much good enough so you
can fit an SF XL power supply which is
kind of a Silverstone proprietary form
factor but they've actually got a fair
number of options they're an ITX
motherboard you can fit two two and a
half inch drives and there's actually
huh you can tell I did another take of
this video because the SSD used to be in
there well there you go this is what
happens when you try and install it with
your offhand while you're trying to do a
video there we go
boom tool list two and a half inch drive
installation as well as tool is five and
a quarter inch drive installation with a
simple little plastic snap moving around
to the back there you go
pretty much as big a graphics card as
you could want to put in whether it's a
rear blower design or an open-air design
there's even a little bit of room at the
top for extra heat pipes or whatever
else you're into the other big one over
here on the ITX well actually I guess
that third one is ITX - well whatever
don't stress about it so the other big
one here is the RV's EO 1 - e the e is
for evolution and basically what they've
done here is they've again eliminated
three and a half inch drive
compatibility but they have added the
ability to put a full sized ATX power
supply in the same form factor as the
original rvz oh one Ravin case so you
can instill install that large graphics
card you can still install dual 120
millimeter fans and I believe even our
radiator up there if you're using one of
their slim radiators you can still
install an ITX motherboard and now you
can put a full-size ATX power supply in
there
the other thing you give up here though
is the five and a quarter inch slimline
optical no longer an optics an option
optical Shin which brings us over to the
cs2 80 so if you guys remember we
actually did a build and what would sort
of be the bigger brother of this guy the
ds3 80 back when we did our actually up
to 12 drive mini NAS with Seagate six
terabyte Enterprise drives this one
still has that same kind of you know
beautiful aluminum fascia kind of
premium Nazz look but again they've done
away with three-and-a-half inch drives
entirely yes you are expected to switch
to either using two and a half inch hard
drives or silverstone is ready for the
future when people are starting to go
full SSD on their naz's so it supports
up to eight of these little two and a
half inch sleds it's got a cooling fan
vent thing in the front with two eighty
millimeter fans you go ahead and remove
that and other than that it's pretty
much the most bog-standard tiny little
case that you could possibly imagine
other than the fact that it's got that
massive backplane so that you can
install those drives without running any
cabling up to the drives themselves so
you can use the little trays so who's
gonna build this I don't know but you
guys can let me know in the comments if
you are ready for it a two and a half
inch drive based nads and if I'm
completely off my rocker saying that I'm
a little bit confused by this product
although I do think it's very cool
because I am one of the few people on
earth who actually has a solid state
based Nazz so thank you for checking out
