I came across a thread where people seem
to be a little bit confused about what
an intel core i7 a demo box should look
like so well here's here's the thread on
overclockers comm you can see that he
received an i7 920 and that there
appears to be a fan inside so don't
worry there's going to be more to this
we're going to show you how to recognize
a proper Intel processor you can see
that the box is covered in spelling
mistakes right here use in a desktop etc
etc hyper-threading is not is not
spelled properly as per the Intel
trademark okay we keep going okay so why
don't we why don't we diverge here and
we'll show you what an Intel demo
processor box looks like this is an
Intel Core i3 530 please note the lack
of any spelling mistakes whatsoever
there's all the proper information about
the CPU inside all right you can see a
CPU through the window please note that
it is not made of paper
it is CPU with a metal heat spreader on
the top and then through the window you
can see that there is a fan and heatsink
made of metal and plastic not made of
some kind of a plaster of Paris and a
sticker okay
also please note that unlike the picture
here where you can see factory-sealed is
actually printed on the Box
factory-sealed is actually printed we've
already broken this seal but you can see
it's printed on the sticker itself and
it comes away in a checkered pattern
because it's an actual proper security
tape okay so why don't we go a little
bit further on our on our thread here
and see what's going on okay inside this
is what it appears to have come with so
why don't we open up our demo processor
and see what we find inside so we have
as far as the heatsink is concerned
okay first we've got a processor we'll
get to that one a little bit after and
we've got a heatsink
so our you'd sink has an aluminum base
and aluminum fins it's got four pushpins
okay it has a four pin fan connector and
some some spinning blades okay and the
one that you could apparently
potentially have ended up with looks
like this it looks like a big chunk of
beige junk and there's a stick
on the top that looks like an intel fan
okay that's pretty good and then the CPU
okay
please wrote that in a proper Intel demo
package there should be a real CPU
looking about something like this not a
sticker of a CPU on top of actually I
don't even know what this is this is
like some random thing
so just for all the customers out there
if you want to recognize if you have a
real Intel processor it should come with
one of these are one of these all right
it should come with a retail box
heatsink that looks something like this
this or this and it should not come with
anything in the box that looks like that
