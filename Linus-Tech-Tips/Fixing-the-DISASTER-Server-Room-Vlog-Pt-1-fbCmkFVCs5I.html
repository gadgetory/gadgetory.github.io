a lot of upgrades since the last time I
showed it off it got a gigantic ups that
conditions power and acts as a battery
backup and more recently it got an
upgrade to our solid state editing Nazz
going from normal SATA SSDs to nvme SSDs
but what hasn't been upgraded is the
organization this place is a disaster
and we need to make some space for
petabyte projects a clustered storage
server that we're working on with
Seagate and 45 drives so we've teamed up
with cableorganizer.com Ubiquiti
Networks bonded logic TRENDnet and proto
Cakes to give Miss place a complete
makeover so come along for the ride I
mean look at this
okay so the plan is as follows cleanup
of the room cleanup of the servers table
management of the room some
reconfiguration and network switch
movements upgrading our Wi-Fi here to
our new ubiquity gear making room for
the petabytes storage cluster by
consolidating some of the roles of some
of our servers adding acoustic dampening
to the room so that it won't be so loud
out here in the studio and adding dust
filtration to the room so we won't end
up with the same situation we were in
before with everything being clogged up
with dust as you might you guys might
remember Johnny from previous episodes
of Linus tech tips such as installing a
UPS I lost the paper like planogram
thing for our patch panel so your on
figuring out what everything is going
through right okay cool
so oh wow are you rolling roll roll roll
are you rolling okay so that is a
perfect example of what can happen when
you cable manage your server room like
this I just accidentally stepped on one
of our power squids then I knocked out
oh no did I knock out new Wanek server
oh my goodness okay well at any rate
sorry Johnny I was just going to say so
all of you like bonds that we set up in
the switches I don't think a single one
of the storage servers other than new
Wanek which I just put in still has any
of that stuff still plugged in this is
one of the ingest stations for footage
and we're going to be moving this
actually to to a tower out here instead
because what we discovered was as much
as it's nice to have like your gtx 1070
69 50 X Extreme Edition systems like
behind locking key we discovered that
there are just issues if you
se3 signaling that prevent all these
high feat peripherals from working
properly with long cables that go into
the room every video yeah not anymore
not even
links they change sit down well while we
wait for the vault to sync file systems
and all that we can move pretty much
everything that's not bolted down out of
gear
okay you know it's um it's amazing how
my server room could end up in this
condition right balls this is my current
solution for a PD you or power
distribution unit so I have these um
like dollar-store
power bars we have to shut the spring
down hey Dennis are you still copying
files on the ingest one yes ah yeah
sorry I have to set it down we go you
need to tear apart the room there okay
so I had all matching drives in it
became six terabyte ones but we
completely ran out of capacity nowhere
to put anything
and I had to expand it somehow what
oh those are you asking what happened to
the 10 terabyte drives that were in the
desk Oh suddenly there are six terabyte
reddit yes these are not officially
supported by unraised yet so I can't
boot this system unless I pop these
drives
wait for it to boot up and then hot-swap
them back in pretty much everything is
off now Oh quiet
now what I've never done this before
the lifeblood of my company I'm just
like pulling it apart no big deal right
okay the like Genki lifeblood of my
company like we're media production
company literally nothing can happen
without this room operating at a hundred
percent or at least they're like sixty
percent that it does oh okay okay this
feels so wrong right now power bar is
connected to the power squid the power
squids connected to the other power
squared actually no this power squid
goes straight into the back of the GPS
okay so that's not that's not that bad
two layers of out Oh
how that hurts will not finder
I'm fine and just hit myself in the face
I got to tell you I have actually lied
to the staff about outages before where
they've been like oh what happened and I
was like oh yeah it was like a crash but
like I stepped on a power cord yeah oh
my goodness I just pulled this power
supply out is that not lost here we go
she
that's all one of the new servers -
what's my excuse for that the way these
are table managed is like horrible in
there yeah it makes it very difficult to
forget it anything I have a plan for
these so once everything is out of here
we're going to like drill a hole in the
top of the in the top of the cabinet
what is this oh man yeah there's a lot
of unnecessary cables flowing out
through the wall here this is so funny
look at this here's like my pathetic
attempt at cable managing back when
there were only five going there and I
just like all these are not capable
matters because they went in after the
fact
whew okay Wow that makes a big
difference flour cables yeah you know
what's funny too is we just bought a
bunch more power squids and Power Bars
because we were out of them and I'm
returning like seven so the population I
think this is about as far down as it
gets until it's time to start pulling
out servers yeah really not my favorite
rail yeah got it oh my goodness it so
does be a so while I'm busting out all
the server and server rooms to ruin
Johnny's working on is getting all of
the switches taken out of the rack
because every single one of them needs
to move for us to do our new cable
management schema Wow
this is our oldest switch
I've never actually blown it up before
this one's kind of a funny config the
guy from data cache recommended like a
modern core i7 and like all this good
stuff and I'm like can I just put some
old hardware that I have lying around
like yeah I guess so
so she got like a p80 motherboard it's
like an eight sixty or an eight 75 K or
something like that and we do get like
random restarts from time to time so
that's another reason to move this over
to a virtual machine Oh some mocha and
now okay go ahead so these are both
fully solid-state new servers yeah you
got it okay
yeah you know just the entire archive
history of everything lmg has ever made
I'll be careful with these SSDs
hey tell I'll tell you something that
hasn't happened since we moved in here
oh the car still won't close damn it
yeah the door closed on the server
cabinet we partnered with Intel and
telecine to talk about two-factor
authentication
it's a pretty important topic and if you
care about online security you should
definitely have it activated wherever
possible if you don't know what
two-factor authentication is it's an
additional layer of security that you
can add to your account beyond your
password in fact we have a full video
about it that you can check out here
enabling it minimizes the chances of
having someone gain access to your
account even if they key log your
password for example tons of websites
have the feature but it's up to you to
enable it so participate in Intel's turn
on to FA campaign today all you have to
do is turn on two-factor authentication
for your primary email address and one
other account after you've done that
head to Twitter and use hashtag turn on
to FA for a chance to win free pizza how
can you go wrong
tella sign will be giving away 40 free
pizzas every week and Intel will also be
giving away a Lenovo yoga 9 10 as the
grand prize
awesome let's slide the door what could
go wrong</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
