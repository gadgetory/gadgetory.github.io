water plus a high amperage transformer
that can literally blow up and take the
rest of your computer hardware with it
what could go wrong good idea or bad
idea it's here and our goal today is to
find out if the usual benefits of liquid
cooling quieter cooler operation can
also apply to a power supply and we
wouldn't be able to do it without tunnel
Baer tunnel barrier makes it easy to

open Internet Tritonal bear for free at
tunnel bear comm /l tt
so the first thing that caught our
attention about this product aside from
it being a water-cooled power supply was
the standard G one-quarter openings
complete with bits power logo under the
modular power connectors if they were
trying to do a quality job they
definitely found a solid partner so
let's keep going then the internals do
still have a fan making this a hybrid
design similar to a Seuss's poseidon
series of graphics cards but at the
bottom of the main PCB there is also
what appears to be a full-length water
block it doesn't seem to have any fins
but it does have a flow meter
interesting now the NDA that we signed
prevents us from tearing down our unit
to show you exactly what that plate
makes contact with but everything we can
see from peering inside suggests that
the internal heatsink array is pretty
typical of a normal air-cooled power
supply and nothing on the fan side
suggested that special design
considerations had been made to
accommodate transferring the heat to the
water block so maybe the top mounted
heat sinks run all the way through the
PCB holes to the base of the block or
maybe there's just a big thick thermal
pad on the bottom of a completely normal
power supply we actually don't know but
none of this prevents us from answering
our original question anyway so let's
move on to find out if cooler and
quieter can be achieved through FS P's
method whatever it is we tested our unit
in both air and liquid cooled mode and
also compared it to one of the best air
cooled power supplies on the market the
corsair ax 1200 I we ran each of them at
idle 2/3 load and max capacity taking
both thermal and acoustic measurements
now one does not simply make a system
consume 1,200 watts of power without
some seriously overkill hardware so to
achieve that we rigged up an X to
ninety-nine platform with the 16 core
core I 979 60 X overclocked to 4.2 Jigga
Hertz then we threw four overclocked
Titan X Pascal's on to the rig for some
gpgpu rendering and ah beautiful
just over 1,400 watts from the wall so
with some CPU voltage adjustments we got
our system dialed in to about 1200 watts
we then used cable mod extenders to be
able to have the power supply in a
separate room in order to control sound
leakage first up then our air cooled
testing at idle both units remain silent
neither of their fans turned on nothing
to see here at 2/3 load the FSP fan spun
up to about 800 rpm and our formal
imagery showed hotspots inside the unit
at over 77 degrees Celsius our xx sound
meter read 44 decibels and I'd say
subjectively it was about as loud as a
d5 pump at 12 volts by comparison our
corsair ax i reached only 700 RPM and
was ever so slightly quieter at full
1200 watt load the fan spun up all the
way to about 1200 rpm reaching 50
decibels and it was definitely audible
over our 12 volt t5 pump making it the
worst offender in a hypothetical system
being pushed to the limits we saw two
significant hotspots with our thermal
camera and we even experienced some
strange clicking and crackling noises
for comparison our course air hit only
950 rpm at 46 decibels
making it significantly less noticeable
over a d5 not to mention that there was
no crackling but it was noticeable over
a d5 so maybe there is some improvement
to be had from water cooling
and besides this the hydro PTM Plus 1200
watt was never meant to be air-cooled so
let's throw this fish back in its
natural habitat with a 240 millimeter
liquid cooler hooked up we started with
this power supply at 2/3 load and oh
well that's kind of weird the fan turned
on it did spin at a slightly lower rpm
than when it was air-cooled but while
our noise measurements did go down we
actually didn't find that it made a
noticeable difference compared to all
air that mid point heat spot was gone
though at full bore the fan spun up to
900 ish rpm quite a bit lower than when
it was air-cooled but it was still
audible over a d5 with pretty much the
same heat spots on the fan side so what
happened here well without being able to
take the unit apart to confirm our the
block is only cooling the back side of
the PCB theory it remains just that a
theory but one that is somewhat
corroborated by these renders that we
found on FS B's website to be clear we
did observe an improvement and it is
possible that a liquid cooled power
supply could achieve better cooling and
noise characteristics than an equivalent
air-cooled one but the implementation on
this one did leave a bit to be desired
we had really hoped that the fan
wouldn't be needed at all as long as the
water cooling didn't fail so I would
like to see a second attempt at this
concept but maybe one that is more
tightly integrated with the water block
actually directly making contact with
the heat producing parts of the power
supply maybe then FSP would be on to
something as it stands at the time of
filming we actually don't know the price
of this unit but we don't think it
really matters anyway
however much it is
we really don't see the point of paying
extra for it over another high quality
high wattage power supply unless you
just must have everything in your system
