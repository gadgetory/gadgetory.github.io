west 2016 they just released a new blade
stealth check it out in the description
down below so I am now sick and that is
a bad thing but this is also sick and
that's a good thing it's a massive ROG G
800 laptop from Asus it has a 68 20 HQ
i7 processor a GTX 1080 desktop glass
graphics card an 18 point 4 inch 4k IPS
screen 64 gigs of DDR 4 memory and one
terabyte of nvme PCIe SSD storage damn
now literally on top of almost all of
that is one of their main key features
and that is their mech tag mechanical
keyboard now they will tell me almost
nothing about it they won't tell me its
response time they won't tell me its
total travel distance they won't tell me
when it actuate s'
nothing what I do know is that while
you're pressing down partway through
there is a tactile bump that is all I
can tell you near the top of the
keyboard you will notice an ROG button
that will open up the Republic of gamers
gaming center where you can set up the M
1 M 2 and M 3 keys to change the
functionality of your F keys to custom
macros depending on what game you're
playing on the left hand side you have a
headphone and microphone jack 1 USB 3
type-a port two USB type-c connectors a
mini DisplayPort HDMI and Ethernet jacks
and a big power connector that requires
you to squeeze it kind of like a
DisplayPort in order to disconnect it
and above that a Kensington lock on the
right hand side they have a much lower
selection of things there are 2 USB 3
ports and 1 SD card reader on the front
there's just a couple speaker ports and
then on the back things get a little
funky there's four pass throughs for
water cooling and one pass through for
power this will be for the large water
cooler add-on if you get the GX model it
is not clear at this time if they will
be selling the water cooler add-on by
itself for people that don't buy the GX
model and want to upgrade down the line
so I'll have to wait till later to try
to figure that out on the bottom there's
four metallic connecting points those
are for connecting to the dock which is
not actually the water cooler those are
two different things
and two of them are just for extending
off of the dock there's also this
mysterious glass panel which may or may
not have something to do with the water
cooling I'm really not sure they like
won't really tell me and I don't know
but I'm getting a G 800 G X 2 review in
office in a little while so hopefully
I'll be able to know then so stay tuned
for that video in terms of all the juicy
performance numbers and stuff like that
you'll just have to wait until I get it
in office they have doom set up here
right now but they're running vsync so
I'm not entirely sure how fast it's
actually able to run the game
I'll have extensive numbers both with
and without the water cooler once I get
this guy to personally test anyways
thank you to Razer for sending us here
