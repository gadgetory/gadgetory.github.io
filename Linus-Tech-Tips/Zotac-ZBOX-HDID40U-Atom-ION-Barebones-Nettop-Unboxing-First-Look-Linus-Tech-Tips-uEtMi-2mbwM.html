meaning to take a look out for a while
this is the zotac zbox or Zed box
whichever you prefer personally I'm not
fussy and this has been quite popular
for a while because it is a bare-bones
all-in-one net top so there is there are
many other companies on the market these
days that are making a net top that is
actually completely customizable and
doesn't come with the things that most
people would want to change they say for
example memory hard drive and OS so
that's pretty much the only things they
haven't included and that gives you a
lot of flexibility like if you want to
build sort of an alternate performance
net top then you could throw in a bunch
of RAM throw in an SSD drive and then
throw you know windows 7 on there and
all of a sudden you've got a great
little fun fake if you decide you don't
want that you can throw in like it the
cheap as possible to two half-inch drive
the least possible amount of RAM and
that's an optimal grandma PC you know
install an old copy of XP that you have
lying around in great boom there you go
it's like the cheapest possible thing
that way so it gives you a lot of
flexibility this particular one is there
is part of their newest generation of
products so this is the HD I d40 you
yeah they're their model names aren't
really all that remembering exactly what
they are friendly but here let's go
through exactly what is included here so
it's the atom d525 so it's a dual core
1.8 gigahertz intel atom processor it
has the next generation which is why I
guess the second generation nvidia ion
chipset with 512 megs ddr3 graphics
memory has two ddr2 expansion slots one
two and a half inch hard drive slot that
is a say 23 gigabit per second gigabit
lan wireless-n card reader that also has
a SATA i don't see that oh yeah there's
the e stato so there's all the included
io hdmi as well as DVI you can get vga
with a dongle and then you've got 810
channel digital audio included it is
extremely silent i have personally
validated this camera man's grandpa
actually built a pc around the zbox ahh
this one was a couple
ago and he was just super impressed with
how fast it was for what he needed which
is basically just like you know browsing
the internet watching a couple videos
you know just sort of no big deal stuff
but also with how quiet it was it was
almost no noise and this is even in
comparison to other net tops on the
market it's fully 1080p capable which is
a here okay and it will play 1080p video
when I don't run around this I I did
actually I built it form so I did test
that as well it includes the vesa mount
and everything else here I think we've
covered already there's a little
explanation of that which I'll leave
there while we go through the packaging
itself so the first thing we find in the
package is a power cable so you're going
to notice that this looks an awful lot
like a notebook power adapter you got
your power brick you got your little DC
plug and then you've got an AC cord that
goes into it the reason is that the
inside of the zbox is an awful lot like
a netbook the only difference is that it
doesn't have a screen I guess there's
probably some other differences but I'm
not going to get too far into that so in
Canada there we go the 1 year warranty
on the zbox we have a driver
installation CD so here I'm going to
refine my throw away the CD suggestion
to download the land drivers off the CD
and then throw it away and then download
the rest of the newest ones off of the
zotac or the the OEM website because
remember for things like audio chip sets
you can download them directly from the
OE n that makes the chip here is a
user's manual here is a quick start
guide which presumably includes things
like where to plug stuff into not it
looks like it doesn't include anything
about upgrading the ram hard drive so
that's kind of interesting I wonder if
that's in the manual I mean is the
assumption that if you've gotten this
far you probably know how to do that
already or what hi here we go yeah so it
does include instructions for
customizing DZ box okay what do we find
in the other side on the other side you
find a DVI DVI to vga adapter some
mounting screws which I guess
me for something as well as a little
stand if you want to have it sit on your
desk like that so tech it's time to play
yeah you won't be playing too much on
this particular one unless it's like
videos and stuff not really not really a
gaming machine Intel Atom an ok so here
we go it comes pre attached to its a
little base amount besa besa I don't
know okay so you just press that little
switch take that off no problem look it
even includes like ventilation built-in
okay so we'll have a look Bob's really
light actually without a thought or
drive in it makes an enormous difference
you'd be surprised okay so on the front
we have eSATA then 2 3 4 USB 2.0 that's
a Gigabit LAN DVI HDMI that is optical
digital audio out as well as our power
input up on the top we have ventilation
so you can clearly see the heatsink here
that is cooling the CPU as well as the
nvidia ion chipset that's where your
exhaust is going to go so we've got
another USB port here conveniently
located oh there's rubber feet here so
you can actually put it down this way so
that's the way you'd use it as a desktop
so there's the front this is the way
you'd use it if you put it on the stand
and then if you obviously attach the
base amount when you put it on the back
of a monitor on the front you can see
we've got a power switch as well as a
couple activity LEDs for wireless as
well as presumably the hard drive we
have another USB port so it's a total of
six and an SD card reader we have a
microphone port as well as a headphone
port that's all you're going to get for
analog audio so unless you want to run
digital you're only going to get 2 point
0 or I guess you give Martin 2.1 if you
had a built-in subwoofer so you're only
going to get two channels out I guess
that's pretty much everything there is
to say about it so basically you need
ram drive and os and you are ready to go
so here's how it works on the back of
the nlcd I promised you guys I'd show
them click you can also wall mount it
that's kind of neat ok so thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the zbox
