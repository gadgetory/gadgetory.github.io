and this is different from the my book
elite because it is smaller so you can
see the actual package for the my
passport which is a two-and-a-half-inch
drive is actually about the same size as
the entire my past my old man and this
is going to confuse me my book elite
that we had a look at a little while ago
so this is an ultra portable hard drive
with a USB dock it is a premium backup
and storage which means that it has
their their premium backup and storage
software it has all the same sort of
things here so it has a three year
limited warranty it has a drive space
indicator which is pretty cool it is
secure i don't know what this means i'm
guessing they think it's like
intelligent or something i would be my
guess it stores up to 38 hours of HD
footage 80,000 mp3s or 64,000 JPEGs so
this is a 320 gig drive obviously the
two and a half inch ones are available
in smaller capacities than the three and
a half inch ones this is all stuff that
we're going to see you when we actually
open the box so why don't we have a look
at the back automatic continuous back up
whenever you add or change a file is
backed up on the spot that's pretty cool
it has a drive lock password protection
with 256 bit hardware encryption it has
an illuminated capacity gauge see at a
glance how much space is left on your
drive and it has convenient one hand
connection to your computer one hand
connection that is a feature that I
can't imagine myself needing but for
like my mother that would be really good
because like connecting things to
computers is not her Forte and like not
like the commercials where she has a kia
forte and that's her forte but like not
her Forte like she's really bad at it
has she ever watches this she's gonna
totally rage it me too all right here we
go so we have the drive itself comes out
first we'll have a look at that in a
moment then we have some documentation
so important note to Windows users it
tells you how to install the software
which we actually covered in the my book
elite unboxing no that wasn't in the
unboxing that was in the how to set it
up video then it comes with a little
guide that is two steps really that's it
huh well there you go so you plug in the
USB cable
and then you run the software that was
easy okay then we have the 300 million
language technical support and limited
warranty guide which is about the size
of your typical wall poster oh no this
one isn't as big Wow okay it still has
this graph though I want to know what
that is okay that's not that's not there
in the English version so there we go
yeah okay I'll figure out how to fold
that back up off camera then we have a
USB cable so this is just a straight USB
a to mini cable then we have a USB dock
cable cameraman wants to look at the
cable smart right here you go you happy
now see the cable it's about this long
yeah you can't see that oh and now I
took it away okay I'm kidding now you
can see how long it is fine re hahaha
but then the dock cable is actually
quite a bit longer so you can see this
one is designed more to reach around to
the back of your computer and then sit
up on your desk kind of thing so all
right why don't we have a look at the
drive itself because that's what you
folks all paid good money to see is the
my passport elite so there it is oh it's
quite slick it's very small as you would
expect from a tuna half-inch drive it's
got a silver ewd logo on the front then
on this side there is nothing and on
this side there is nothing and oh no
that's a USB port sorry that isn't
nothing and then on this side there is
nothing and on this side there is an
illuminated capacity LED as well as a
little lock light and then a power
indicator as probably an activity LED as
well on the back it is labeled my
passport and then there is a serial
number and a part number so it's got
four little rubberized feet so if you're
using it on your desk you don't actually
have to balance it this way you can just
put it down like this and then if you're
using it with the dock you can see the
doc is just a USB port so you just go
like this and plug it in that way
see it's funny because I was saying my
mom isn't good at plugging things in but
then now you look at me trying to do it
it's hard oh I get it it's because it
goes in it like an angle it doesn't
actually sit like flat so it doesn't go
in like this straight in it actually
like kind of slides in it sort of this
angle there there now I've got it
figured out and want we have a look at
that from a different angle okay I guess
that pretty much covers it that's my
unboxing of the my passport elite</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
