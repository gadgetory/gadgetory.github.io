the Rison launch has been between the
hype in the run-up to its launch and
Andy's Stern refusal to reveal any but
the barest details everybody is talking
about Rison but could anything live up
to this level of expectation let's find
out
Brow's privately and securely with
tunnel there the simple VPN app try
tunnel bear for free at the link in the
video description meet then AMD's brand
new cpu architecture the risin seven
flavor of which is launching today it
sports eight cores each with SMT so
similar to Intel hyper-threading and
boasts a whopping 52 percent improvement
in instructions per clock over AMD's
previous best and a TDP of only 65 to 95
watts that is a big shot across Intel's
bow especially considering the risin 7
has been positioned as performance
competitive with the enthusiast class
core i7 6800 K and 6900 k-6 and 8 core
chips that Intel rates at 140 watts so
how did AMD do it well there's a lot of
nitty-gritty that we won't get too deep
into but here's the TLDR AMD's sense mi
allows the processor to thoroughly
monitor itself accurate to within a
milliamp millivolt nila watt and single
degree Celsius 1000 times per second
AMD's precision boost uses that data
along with individual testing at the
factory to determine the ideal clock
frequency within 25 megahertz steps for
optimal performance even going as far as
to boost beyond the rated speed using
extended frequency range or XFR add that
to their infinity fabric scalable
high-speed interconnect smarter branch
prediction a smarter neural net inspired
prefetch and the more efficient cache
setup and you've got a very
oversimplified nutshell version of Rison
of course it's performance would be
meaningless if it weren't price
competitively and boy howdy is it ever
currently the most expensive CPU in the
range
is $4.99 us which might seem like a lot
if you compare it to Intel's mainstream
flagship core i7 7700 K at 349 but AMD
reckons their top dog is more comparable
to the core i7 6900 K a $1,050 chip of
course with their history of hype
training the bananas out of mediocore
cpu releases we can't just take AMD's
word for any of this so let's dive
straight into the moment you've all been
waiting for hands-on with Rison will be
pitting horizon 7 against rivals core i7
6900 k 6800 K and 7700 K and for fun
we've also thrown in the core i5 7600 K
and dusted off our FX 8350 with each
bench kitted out with a Titan XP and 32
gigs of g.skill memory shout out at this
point to a soos for providing and
helping us learn the ins and outs of
their rog crosshair 6 hero built with
AMD's X 370 chipset the first new
enthusiast chipset since 2011 for Andy
and a few special Asus twists like their
native USB 3.1 front panel connector
comprehensive overclocking and tweaking
toolset are a sync RGB lighting
compatibility with a m3 and AM for
cooler holes and their new s12 20 audio
solution it should be noted that you
won't need the more expensive X 370
unless crossfire and SLI support is
important to you but in spite of all of
aces help think back to that asterisk
about 30 seconds ago while I would love
to say that the early rumors of a m4
having difficulty hitting higher memory
frequencies were greatly exaggerated our
1800 X chip managed a mere 26 66
megahertz with multiple kids including
the one supplied by AMD any higher no
post we hope this can be ironed out in
firmware
but with how heavily AMD Zen
architecture relies on fast low latency
RAM to keep the course fed our scores
for synthetic benchmarks in particular
might suffer a little bit kicking off
our testing we have why cruncher at 50
million digits of delicious pie the
1,800 X doesn't fare so well in the
single threaded test but pulls just
ahead of the 7600 K in the multi
threaded one this test is r an intensive
though so this lower than expected
result isn't surprising Cinebench being
much closer to a real-world workload
paints a more optimal picture with Rison
actually beating out the 6900 k in the
multi threaded test and coming in just
under in the single threaded test cpu
mark single threaded test puts rise in
back at the bottom of our modern CPUs
while in the overall it flips in neatly
between the sixty nine hundred and sixty
eight hundred K moving on to 7-zip Rison
killed it coming in well above all but
the sixty nine hundred K and PC mark
tells a similar tail with AMD's rises
seven flagship outperforming the X 99
chips in both tests though it should be
noted that PC marks lightly
multi-threaded workload definitely
favors the 7700 K s blistering clock
speeds reel bench continues the overall
trend although we see rise and stumble
with heavy multitasking here a potential
Ram speed limitation while in Adobe
Media encoder rise in seven and the X 99
chips are very competitive a doe
reveals no obvious storage bottleneck
with similar if slightly lower results
to our Intel test benches and then
moving on to gaming Deus Ex mankind
divided shows a fairly tight race with
Rison in the middle rise of the Tomb
Raider sees rise in rise to the occasion
to take top spot which it managed to
hold in an older title Crysis 3 moving
on to a more eSports oriented title we
tested csgo specifically with chips that
represent the best single-threaded
performance that intel has to offer
today
and that AMD has today and before the
launch of risin unsurprisingly if you're
running at 240 Hertz monitor like this
one from Asus that we checked out before
and your PC's purpose is pure frame
pushing the 7700 K might not look quite
as obsolete as Andy would like it to for
our streaming test we gave it a worst
case scenario with ashes of the
singularity's CPU focused benchmark both
with and without OBS recording in the
background we compared the recording
performance to streaming and it was the
same and at twitch quality we see that
actually none of our CPUs really had a
hard time with this over just running
the benchmark the 69 hundred K runs away
with this one while the poor FX 8350
wishes we'd left it on the shelf
compared to Intel click sync encoding
the output from our x264 testing is
quite a bit clearer to my eyes but go
ahead and pause the video to take a
close look at this blown up shot to
judge for yourself let us know if you'd
like us to dig deeper into streaming in
the comments below because AMD was
showing rise in just butt-kicking with
7700 K so did AMD come out of nowhere
then leapfrog Intel on performance and
disrupt the market well yes no and yes
artists our testing shows the top-end
1800 X sitting between the 69 hundred K
and 7700 K when it comes to single
threaded performance and hovering around
but not quite matching the 69 hundred K
in our multi-threaded tests there's no
question here that heavier users will
love AMD right now for bringing more
affordability to hike or count chips
without the massive power draw and
single threaded compromises that existed
before and as for coming out of nowhere
with this that definitely happened but
I'm actually not sure who gets the
credit for risin 7
disruptive positioning is it AMD for
coming in and giving the consumer nearly
twice the performance per dollar value
of a sixty nine hundred K or is it Intel
for stubbornly refusing to acknowledge
the benefits of more course for the
mainstream consumer and creating a
confusing product stack where bang for
the buck varies so dramatically within
their own products they handed AMD's
marketing department a lot of firepower
here by allowing them to bang me twice
the value of the sixty nine hundred k
drum while conveniently ignoring that
intel also produces chips that deliver
twice the value of a sixty nine hundred
k or more I guess that's neither here
nor there though the major takeaway here
isn't that the eighteen hundred XD
powered all in its path but that as AMD
used to be so good at doing they've
identified a market segment where no
directly competing product really exists
and engineered a solution and busiest
looking for something bigger than a 7700
K but not wanting to lose
single-threaded performance and eat
nothing but instant noodle for a year by
stepping up to a sixty nine hundred K
will be delighted with Verizon seven
lineup meanwhile professionals who don't
need a trans lots or funderbolt will
also find a CPU that performs better
than intel's mainstream while lacking a
couple of extras very appealing and all
of this ignores to the six core and four
core zen core solutions that are coming
later on this year to disrupt Intel's
Core i5 and core i3 products so AMD fans
rejoice then with Rison AMD is back in a
big way and even if you're on Team Blue
you should be happy too because
competition is always good for the
consumer do you feel like your cellular
provider doesn't give a rat's patoot
about you
Who am I kidding of course you do so
check out ting we've got a link in the
video description these guys are all
about customer service when you call
them you do not speak to a robot there
is no phone tree you get put through
directly to a person and somehow they
managed to do that with a very
affordable average ting bill of only 23
dollars per month per device for their
customers they do this by making
everything pay for only what you use so
all you do is head over to their savings
calculator that's Linus ENCOM we've got
that link below you enter your last few
bills you enter how much you're paying
now and it spits out how much you'll
save by switching to ting and they've
actually got lower data rates across the
board now so don't hesitate check it out
today and if you switch you'll also get
$25 in service credit or towards a new
device using our link so thanks for
watching guys if this video sucks you
can dislike but if you liked it hit the
like button get subscribed maybe check
out the link where to buy the stuff we
featured in the video description while
you're down there we've got a merch
store in a community forum as well which
you should check out and now that you're
done doing all that stuff you're
probably wondering what to watch next so
check out that little video players
thumbnail thing go ahead click it there
will be another one of our videos there
you'll like it
that was the computer ok well that was
exciting huh
this is probably so ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
