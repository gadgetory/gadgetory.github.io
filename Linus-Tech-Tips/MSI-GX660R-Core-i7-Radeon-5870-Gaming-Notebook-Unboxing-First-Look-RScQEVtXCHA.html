the Palms Hotel in Las Vegas I'm just
looking out the window right now so you
can't really see much from the window
here but I guess what do you really
expect to see there's an Eiffel Tower
you're sort of over there I guess that's
not too bad there's the Rio all right so
I'm gonna sort of head back over here
where I'm going to be doing a surprise
unboxing so this is an MSI notebook this
is part of their GX 660 R series and I'm
gonna tell you guys all about the spec
of this particular model coming up live
from CES 2011 now I'm not really live in
Las Vegas all right so it's only fitting
I break the seals on this bad boy with
the killer neck killer neck killer NIC
heatsink that I got at the MSI
overclocking event today so we're gonna
go ahead and break this open I did not
bring my unboxing knife with me because
I did remember about how I had it
confiscated last time I tried to take it
on an airplane so yes
lesson learned and I will not be
repeating that mistake
so as a GX okay with GX has the first
two letters of the part number here it's
fairly obvious already that this is a
gaming series notebook so I can tell you
guys right now that it uses a core i7
processor it supports up to two internal
two and a half inch hard drives up to 12
gigs max of ddr3 memory and it also has
a powerful
Radeon HD 5870
graphics card so let's see how much of
that in MSI is going to cover on the
outside of the box for us it looks like
most of the features on here are things
that I covered already you can see the
exclusive three times ddr3 a sodium
slots for maximum 12 gigs of ram with
the way that prices are coming down on
ddr3 that may be a very possible thing
that you can upgrade this particular
model with we've also got mxi exclusive
TDE plus that is turbo drive engine plus
technology for increasing the speed of
your CPU and GPU
about that as well over here all right
we've also got yeah that I mentioned
before so it comes by default with dual
SATA hard drives in raid zero but what I
would really recommend for a notebook
like this and I'm probably going to
outfit this one with this particular
setup would be changing one of the
drives to a an SSD and then using the
other drive as a storage hard drive
we've got an HD webcam supporting 720p
with 30fps as well as support for USB
3.0 now seven fight Dynaudio that's kind
of an interesting interesting thing to
call out on a notebook because honestly
I've been complaining about notebook
audio for years and it's good to see
that there's not only MSI but there's
actually a couple companies that are
really working towards addressing what
has been just a glaring omission in the
notebook market and that is a notebook
that is really designed to deliver good
quality sound whether you're running it
off the speakers or off of some
headphones so here's the overall spec of
this particular notebook and stop
setting particularly now sorry about
that guys and this is in French so while
I could do it in actually sure why not
okay so the color is black black grey
and black the screen is a 15.6 inch 1920
by 1080 P they're calling it the layer
type although that's not very flattering
I think what they mean to say is glossy
or vibrant we have an Intel Core i7 740
QM processor with dual 320 gig hard
drives in raid 0 those are 7200 rpm
drives this is a performance model so
it's all about performance we've got 6
gigs of ddr3 running in triple-channel
and we have a blu-ray combo drive so
that's pretty cool
Wireless has we've got Bluetooth and
wireless n we have Windows 7 home
premium 64-bit and the battery is a 9
cell battery which for a gaming model I
guess it better be if you're hoping to
have any kind of reasonable battery life
and it looks like looks like French
people don't get to know that the VGA is
an ATI Radeon HD 5870
one gig DDR 5 i I really don't think
that was on the French side
check that out yes it's not there so why
don't we go ahead and get our our killer
seal breaker here and let's get this
thing opened up here we go if I can
figure out how to open the box which I
have done on a number of occasions with
various products as you guys may or may
not already be aware let's see what we
got inside here so as usual reduce
accessories first that looks like the
notebook is there and maybe these are
little MSI ends actually that's probably
just for packaging stuff so we have our
accessory box just gonna move this so
that we can get the best possible light
I know the lighting is not ideal here
but I wouldn't be me if I didn't unbox
things anywhere and everywhere so the
first thing we find is a power cord next
we find an AC adapter so that's where
that power plate is going to plug into
it is pretty large but if you expect
that on a gaming model because there is
a lot of power that needs to be
delivered I'll tell you guys what this
thing's rated for in just a minute here
so this guy is rated for 19 bolt out put
and up to six point three two amps so
that would be well over the maximum of
what I would expect this notebook to
draw it's actually not that heavy for
such a large power brick here I'll give
you guys my my iPhone for comparison if
I can find it I apologize for the state
of my room here I just kind of threw my
things down on the everywhere when I
walked in so here's my iPhone for
comparison okay so it's a little bit
longer than an iPhone it's about the
same width and in terms of thickness
there you can compare that as well
so hopefully that helps all right we've
got some discs here we've got drivers
manual and utilities we have a blu-ray
and DVD solution okay so we have
playback in Britain suite for multimedia
systems pretty cool we have a Windows 7
home premium thing I'm just going to
make sure my serial number is
around there because last thing I need
is no serial number for this particular
notebook that I did it again
f3 hotkey recovery function so let's
find out what this is the purpose is to
restore the system back to the factory
default settings with f3 hotkey always
backup important data before using the
f3 hotkey recovery that's a very good
idea so there you go
so they've apparently made it quite easy
to restore the system to factory
defaults which is great if you're like
mining a system like this for your mom
and you don't want to go over there
every time she has some kind of a
problem
ok maybe your mum's a gamer my mom isn't
but you never know it's still a good
feature to have in their notebook line
regardless of which notebook model we're
talking about so here we have a Quick
Start Guide which covers the basics as
well as some common operating features
so here let's show you guys what kind of
features we have with the function keys
so we can enable or disable a touchpad
we can change our output we can turn on
or off the Eco engine which I'm assuming
is going to preserve some power we can
enable or disable our webcam wireless
LAN Bluetooth 3G I don't think that's
going to function in Canada not 100%
sure about that we can adjust brightness
volume as well as our mute so that's how
we can change things about the system
with the function keys while we are
operating it with a little warranty
summary here so it looks like it is a 24
month 2 year warranty in the United
States and Canada here is AC e
complaints booklet which I've never seen
before and I'm not even remotely
interested in so next we have our 9 cell
battery and we're almost there guys
we're almost there here's our 9 cell
battery it's rated for 7800 milliamp
hours and finally we are ready to take
the notebook out of the package
so I actually just arrived in Las Vegas
this morning I had an MSI event today I
went to an OCC event today as well also
had a steel serious thing to do and then
tomorrow is another very full schedule
I'm gonna try and get as many videos
uploaded while I'm down here as possible
but it's sometimes a bit of a challenge
and I might have to wait till I'm back
in Vancouver really give you guys the
full update MSI has come such a long way
in terms of their shell design this is
just really slick looking you've got
kind of a neat scaled finish going on up
here hopefully you guys can see that
okay and then the the top of the
notebook is no I wish I wasn't getting
sort of weird reflections off it there
we go
so the top of the notebook has kind of
an angular shape to it kind of like a
stealth fighter and it is a glossy black
finish and then we've got a little
chrome accent here that I love chrome
accents there you guys know a little
something about means another one there
I love that okay so let's go ahead and
sort of turn it on its side let's see
what we're gonna find here so we're
gonna find a vent pull up two USB 3.0
ports that's outstanding actually we
have an SSD slot as well as a USB 2.0 I
hope I didn't say 2.0 I meant 3.0 they
are color-coded blue and they have a
little SuperSpeed logo above them and
then finally we have an Express yeah
whatever that is it's a PCIe or whatever
expansion slot that you probably won't
use but you'll be kicking yourself if
you don't have one and you do need
something for it here on the back we're
gonna find pretty much the usual fare a
Kensington lock covered ventilation hole
so that's kind of that's kind of
peculiar I wonder if they're using the
shell for another model as well that
does require ventilation over here
interesting to say the least here we
have our power in as well as our land we
do have support for VGA as well as HDMI
video out and we also have an eSATA port
on the back
finally moving around to the other side
Hey look at that looks like we've got
dedicated jacks for 5.1 audio out as
well as a microphone that's pretty cool
so they really are taking audio
seriously on this model we've got
another USB 2.0 port I love having one
on the other side just in case you want
to run a mouse off this port or if it's
not convenient to have it up against the
other side so that's a really nice thing
to see and then here we have our blu-ray
combo drive which is nicely angled with
the shape of the overall notebook
alright let's have a quick look at the
bottom although I'm not gonna let you
guys see that just yet so that my
product key can remain not all over
YouTube and I'm just going to install
the battery really quick here and I'll
rather I'll show you guys how to install
the battery so you just put that in
there lower it in and that's it you've
installed the battery so I'll show you
guys the bottom of the notebook here you
can see that we have easy access to
upgrade the RAM as well as the optical
drive as well as the hard drive so just
by pulling off this whole plate you can
get access to pretty much the entire
internals of the notebook for user
upgrades and you can bet that I will be
doing some user upgrades on this guy
we've got what appears to be a speaker I
guess that's a subwoofer actually so
please correct me if I'm wrong but that
looks like a subwoofer on the bottom of
this notebook that's a pretty cool
feature all right so let's have a look
at the inside here okay so it's covered
in plastic so we won't have any problems
like getting damaged and shipping here's
our HD webcam up here at the top I'm
going to go ahead and remove this and
you guys can come along for the ride
because I don't have a can then it sort
of conveniently and shots for me when I
need it and all that good stuff so I'm
pulling all of the protective film off
oh my goodness I'm undressing it oh yeah
let's see what this says got a question
or problem contact MSI customer service
good thinking okay so here you can see
that the screen is quite glossy you can
clearly seeing me in the reflection off
the screen oh there's your microphone
for the webcam so it's right up there
once again we've got a sort of some
chrome accents up here chrome accents
down here love that overall a glossy
black finish and then there's also some
matte black accents in here as well so
I'm going to go ahead and remove this as
well hopefully I can get a fingernail
under that and I can lift that up there
we go so there are our our stereo
speakers and here's their sound by
Dynaudio again I'm just gonna try and
get an angle here where you guys can see
it more easily and you don't have so
much reflection off of my lamp but I
also don't completely block my light as
well so here why don't we do that that's
not a bad angle okay so let's get in
here so we've got our two point one
speaker set up so that looks like two
speakers up here one subwoofer down in
the bottom we've got our power switch
here as well as a nice chrome and the
side logo we've got some buttons up here
which looked to be touch sensitive
buttons are either got or these are just
indicators so I'm gonna have to find
that out for you guys and I'm gonna be
giving you guys my full impressions on
this notebook once I have a chance down
here and CES I don't know how realistic
that is but once I do get back I'm gonna
tell you everything that I have to say
about this notebook overall build of it
seems so far quite sturdy although it's
really hard to tell until I've really
typed a lot on the keyboard and really
played around with the shell opened it
up in terms of keyboard layout it looks
pretty strong so far this is not a
bilingual layout I hate bilingual
layouts to be perfectly honest with you
guys I've got a properly positioned
shift key I have a short shift key here
but I don't mind that because it would
be very rare that I would actually reach
over here to hit the shift key it's much
closer here so I really like this design
choice that they've made here to put the
arrow keys there to condense the
keyboard to give me a number pad because
I do actually work on my notebook even
though it is a GX gaming notebook yeah
I'm still gonna do some work so it's
great to have a number pad if I have to
do any data entry the enter and
backspace keys are also the appropriate
size and look at this I've got
conveniently highlighted WASD keys so
yeah yeah there's a lot
Gaming focus in there for sure we have
one Windows key here and then we do not
on the other side but that doesn't
really bother me very much and I think
that's pretty much all I need to say
about the keyboard the touchpad uses
kind of a textured finish so you
shouldn't get too much grease built up I
don't really like very very smooth touch
pads and I'm glad to see that everyone
seems to be pretty much moving away from
that same thing here we've got a bit of
a glossy shiny chrome finished outer
portion here but the actual buttons
themselves are using like a brushed
finish so that they're not going to be
too bad in terms of finger magnetism and
you've also got a little bit of a grip
on it so you can really feel where your
finger goes without it sliding off or
anything like that we've got some
stickers here something about ATI
mobility Radeon HD 5870 graphics Windows
7 core i7 Energy Star and DTS surround
sensation PC look at that I wonder if
what are these hmm interesting okay well
we've got another little summary of the
technology that's present in this
notebook although I've covered that
already and I think that pretty much
concludes my unboxing I'm gonna take a
moment and actually fire it up here with
you guys there we go we've got an MSI
boot screen we've got appears to be
Western Digital 320 gig drives in raid 0
you can see they are configured in the
raid BIOS that's such a cool feature
being able to have raid in a notebook I
mean you could even throw two SSDs in
here throw those in raid zero and get
just crazy speed for a notebook I'm also
going to play around in the near future
I'll do another video for you guys I
want to play around with the
overclocking feature for the CPU because
I will be using this notebook for some
video rendering and I want to find out
how much of a performance improvement I
can get by overclocking the CPU so there
we go were fired up and I'm gonna spend
some time now to do some setup thank you
for checking out my unboxing of the msi
GX
