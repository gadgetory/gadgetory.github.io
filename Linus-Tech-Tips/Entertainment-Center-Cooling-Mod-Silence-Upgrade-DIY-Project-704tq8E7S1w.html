did my last media center PC upgrade
thing because while I did put fan
control in place using the Noctua
industrial 2000 rpm fans definitely
resulted in louder just even idle noise
levels from that computer then I
consider good enough for a media center
so I'm going to show you guys will do it
like a baseline reading here and then
turn on the computer even from the
listening position my not super
exceptional sound level meter is going
to be able to pick up a difference so go
ahead have a look at the screen and then
I'm going to turn on the computer
alright so there's our baseline reading
I'm going to go ahead and turn my media
center PC on
so even with fan control enabled you can
see that I done kind of goofed on the
configuration of this I set it up with
Noctua industrial fans and even though I
went with the 2000 rpm ones and I do
have them on fan controllers it's not
good enough and there's still a
noticeable difference even from this far
away from the computer on the couch here
where I would typically be sitting to
watch a show or a movie or something so
something needs to be done today we'll
be trying to address this because even
at idle it is pretty loud and actually
noticeable over a movie especially
because I have kids upstairs and I can't
like you know just crank the sub to
overpower it
the Coolermaster Nova touch tkl is
powered by doper hybrid capacitive
switches for the ultimate typing
experience and is now available for a
reduced price click my face to learn
more so of course you can always put
quieter fans into a system in this case
we're going to be using naktu as new NFS
12 days so these are the replacements
for the B's and the main improvement
seems to be these like anti stalling
bumps on the blades so yeah ok cool at
any rate these run at a mere 800 rpm
without the low noise adapter inside and
600 rpm with the adapter so I'm planning
to use the adapters which means we need
to find out if that's having an adverse
effect on our temperatures because if
you guys remember the reason I put fans
into this cabinet in the first place was
what was that the temps of the system
inside were so high that it was thermal
throttling anyway so we're getting a
baseline here our GPU runs at a power
percentage of about 68 at it's 80 degree
cap it's actually more important to look
at that power percentage in a benchmark
like this because that tells us how much
it's throttling back and then our CPU
tops out around seventy-five degrees on
the little graph on the right so we're
going to go ahead we're going to swap
these fans and we're going to find out
how much of an impact that has on temps
but first I need to get this cat off my
lap he's like surely you misunderstood I
would like to sit here and you're
pushing is not helping
there we go hope and I need this little
man thank you sir
all right let's shut this baby down and
terror apart again
there we go when are you gonna take a
victim are you gonna help me fix the
computer loan man 30 I just want to fix
it you already fixed it we didn't do
anything yet no anything yet
take this one for me yeah how about this
one
you put that somewhere safe okay you go
put those somewhere safe yeah I'm gonna
take him on the table let me put these
on the table just get this hole plugged
this is a good chance to have a look at
how dusty it's gotten in here not too
bad actually
even though I have my filter and it's
not ideal position on the exhaust side
of these fans they're they're not bad at
all all right let's uh let's get to
swapping out all those fans my camera
person is being assaulted here little
man do you want to open one bolt yeah
are you gonna take out all the pieces
all done okay how many fans do we have
now Oh SOB time to install them now
right okay you're gonna help me yeah we
gotta take out the old fans before we
can put in the new ones do you think the
brown one looks nicer do you think the
black one looks nice how many people
you'll find to agree with you but you're
entitled to your opinion
can you pass me a screwdriver sweetie
I'm gonna get two orange font for you
okay great thank you um honey the orange
screwdrivers over here thanks sweetie
oh I think the mesh is the problem
Oh could be really bad then all right I
guess we should clean this out since
we're in here anyway I'm gonna find him
okay
hey did you put all the fans in while I
was gone oh did you put the screws in
let's vacuum it out first okay I won't
vacuum your foot why would you think I
would vacuum your foot okay
okay I'm gonna have to get those back
out from under there
oh wow your arms are small okay can I
have two more screws oh thank you all
right you can help me with the screws on
the next one okay can I have that Nash
now that's a fan not a mesh this one
yeah thank you
are you screwing in the nuts okay should
we replace two more fans all right I'm
gonna need your help with these ones
okay I want you to reach in here and get
the screws while I undo them from the
back okay see that one do you see them
moving you got to grab those ones help
me find them please sure just a sec okay
honey these ones I'm pushing them out
see you're welcome good job how many do
you have
I don't you don't want any more one good
oh you should have one more you should
have four this one goes in there all
right I need you to yeah I need you to
hand me one of those new fans and then
we're gonna go ahead and install those
in the back
oh I think the I think the screws
actually going from the other side yeah
it's going to go in this way this way
I'm playing with Daddy
hey hey you when I how'd you get back
here because I got back here
finally supplies oh you brought the fan
yeah glad to sign from you oh thank you
okay I'm gonna put it inside I know so
here's the progress we've made so far
we've got the new fans installed in the
bottom with the filter so these are the
intakes right under the system and then
we've got the two new fans also other
two new fans installed at the back as
exhausts so now all that's left to do is
take the Y cables that I had before so
these ones plug in each of these sets of
fans and then plug them right into the
back of the computer because if you
didn't see my last media center upgrade
vlog I can show you guys the way I have
it set up at the back of the system
whoops is we have either molex power out
to that splitter or just to four pin and
controllable connectors just coming
directly off of extensions from the
motherboard so that's what I'm going to
be plugging them into okay move your
butt little man okay we're going to get
it silent for sure this time okay little
now I'm almost done I'm gonna plug in
our HDMI
and then our USB Ethernet no we're not
gonna plug in the UPS you just see I
think we're good
yep I think we're good I think we're
good all right back inside we go
I don't any need to come up close to the
front so that it gets a signal all right
oh just wait okay let's plug in this
whoa I said wait little man well that's
already quieter oh we didn't put this in
yet so we've got our core i5 4570
processor in there we've got our GTX 980
16 gigs of ram there you go sweet and OH
let's go ahead and set these a little
bit lower because these fans might
actually run lower than 600 rpm on
occasion I don't want an alarm to go off
so I guess we'll leave the control
on there we go we can see what speed our
fans are running at and let's reboot and
find out if our temps are still okay
much quieter Wow that made a big
difference all right so let's let's why
don't we start by getting our sound
reading then and then and then we'll go
ahead and get our temperature reading
okay hon can I get you to go in the
other room so we can get our sound
reading I love you very much but you're
loud that's kind of bizarre that's lower
than our baseline from before well let's
not put too much stock in what the sound
level meter says I Denny reheat it
definitely
way quieter like I can barely hear from
here so let's just find out if it
adversely affected temperatures alright
so there we have it it's results time
pretty much what I expected so our CPU
temps are a little bit higher you can
see there's one hovering around 77
degrees there and our power percentage
on our GPU is a little bit lower but
this is all very very reasonable levels
and for how much quieter it is I will
take that trade off every single time
like it went from being obviously
noticeable over the sound of a movie to
I can hardly hear it even without
anything else playing so there you go
yay lower rpm yeah using the right fans
for the job guys thanks for watching

it if you thought it just plain blew

tips forum or under the video player
whichever works best for you if your
feelings are a little more complicated
than this as always also linked in the
video description we have a place where
you can buy cool Linus tech tips
t-shirts not like this one we have this
is not a Linus tech tip t-shirt we have
Linus tech tip seizures though I assure
you it's linked there also in the video
description you can find a link to
contribute to us if you think what we're
doing is important and you want to
support it and finally you can change
your Amazon bookmarks one with our
