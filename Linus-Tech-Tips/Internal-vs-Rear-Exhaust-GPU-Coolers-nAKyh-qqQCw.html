like the stuff you need for gaming can
be confusing to buy with all the
marketing fluff that gets thrown at
gamers in fact soon we'll be helping
gamers narrow down their chair choices
but today something a little bit more
traditional Linus tech tipsy gaming
graphics card shopping ensure swift
victory with Corsairs highly responsive
lightweight gaming mouse the Sabre RGB
click now to learn more now often the
most obvious difference between one
video card and another is the cooler and
this can have a tangible impact on the
noise from your PC the lifespan of your
card and even the performance of your
gaming rig thanks to the way that modern
graphics cards turbo up their speeds
when they're running nice and cool and
throttle them back down when they're
overheating now there are marketing
names for the coolers used by the
various card makers windforce vapor x
direct to you etc etc and some of them
are bound to be a little bit better or
worse than others but today's video is
going to tackle this from a broader
perspective how does the OEM style rear
exhaust blower design that you'll find
on a reference video card one with a
cooler design by AMD or Nvidia and then
simply produced and rebranded by the
manufacturer compared to the open air
designs that are typical of a non
reference video card where they blow the
air kind of around in the case versus
blowing it out the rear panel so let's
walk you guys through the tests we'll be
using we wanted to examine this from the
perspective not necessarily of the most
extreme PC enthusiast but rather a more
typical PC gamer so instead of using a
corsair 900 d case we went with a bit
phoenix shadow a mid tower chassis with
decent but decidedly unexceptional
cooling with 120 millimeter fans at the
front and at the rear on the inside we
didn't do any special cable management
we installed a quad core Core i7 non
overclocked
on a passively cooled asus motherboard
and we installed our power supply fans
down so we didn't take its own fresh air
and exhaust it directly out the back
without affecting the other components
in our test for our cards we chose a
geforce gtx 780 Ti win force from
gigabyte and a reference gtx 780 Ti that
we've got directly from Nvidia we chose
these cards because as a high-end card
the 780 Ti generates a fair bit of heat
giving us a worst case scenario where
the difference in the results will
actually be measurable and because our
780ti wind force uses the same PCB
design as our reference card eliminating
board efficiency as a variable
we also overclocked our reference card
to put it roughly in line with the rated
clock speeds of the wind force card now
we tested each configuration at idle and
under load with Crysis 3 no unrealistic
synthetic benchmarks here and took
temperature readings with our K type
probe at the front intake rear exhaust
and inside the case near the stock CPU
cooler then we also took CPU GPU
motherboard and motherboard vrm
temperatures with a Seuss's AI suite
monitoring software and MSI Afterburner
now normally when we benchmark graphics
cards we do it on an open-air test bench
for the ease of swapping them in and out
but it appears that we may need to
re-evaluate this practice at some point
in the future because while we did still
observe lower temperatures and therefore
marginally higher boost clocks on our
open-air graphics card just like we do
on an open bench the internal
temperature of our case and therefore
the temperature of every other component
inside went up significantly we're
talking an increase in the neighborhood
of about 5 degrees and on top of all
this the noise advantage that we
normally observe with open air coolers
was nowhere to be found our wind force
card was actually noticeably louder
while the entire system was noticeably
louder with our wind force card then
with our reference card so there you go
non-reference cooler smite let your GPU
run a little bit cooler but the rest of
your system will run hotter and possibly
even louder unless you take the
appropriate precautions because remember
this test scenario was designed to show
maybe not quite the worst but a very bad
case scenario a mid-range GPU with a
lower TDP will not affect your case
temperatures to nearly the same degree
degree like degrees of temperature sorry
and adding more cooling fans or using a
better ventilated case like a fractal
arc series Corsair graphite series or
cooler master half series would help as
well so the real point here is make sure
that you use open air coolers
responsibly and work to keep the rest of
your case temperatures down let us know
in the comments if you thought this was
interesting and if you'd like to see us
tackle this topic again with maybe a
different overall system configuration
and speaking of overall different system
configurations how about ones that are
super hyper compact for free yes ok not
everyone gets one for free but this is
the Intel not d50 425 0 w ykh wow that
is a bit of a tongue twister and if
you're not familiar with the nook these
things are freaking cool there are
little tiny pcs like so small you can
fit them in your hand but they're
actually fully featured pcs so you can
install soda memory in them they've got
Intel onboard graphics they've got Intel
CPUs they've got support for USB 3
they've got support for HDMI and
DisplayPort out this particular one has
mini DP and mini HDMI out for up to dual
displays and supports Gigabit LAN and
finally also has you know your built-in
sort of sound and all that stuff so
basically they're useful for a ton of
different things if you just need a
little tiny PC for basic light use it'll
do for that if you need a media center
PC this kind of thing makes a ton of
sense compared to building up a
full-sized tower next to your TV when
you can just hide it in the back or hide
it in a corner or really hide it
wherever you want because the thing is
actually passively cooled will be
completely silent wherever you run it to
the other thing that they can be really
great for it has a stream PC ok yes this
is very similar to media PC because it
would also be hooked up on your TV but
because of the Intel onboard graphics
built in h.264 decoder if you have a
gaming PC somewhere else in your house
you'll be able to decode using steam
in-home streaming and run your games
with that
really very little latency completely
separately without building up a
separate gaming machine so they're super
cool they're actually surprisingly
affordable and we are giving one away
for free don't you guys love it when we
do giveaways so check out the link in
