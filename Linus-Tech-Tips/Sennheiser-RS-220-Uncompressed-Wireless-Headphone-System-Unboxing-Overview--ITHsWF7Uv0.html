the rs.220 from Sennheiser so their
selling point for this one the big one
is digital wireless uncompressed stereo
sound now this is a higher-end successor
so guys don't look now but this is an
expensive wireless headset so this is
their successor to their previous
generation sort of 180 series products
with what they are considering to be an
upgrade which is okay high-end digital
wireless headphone system for
uncompressed stereo sound and
outstanding standing wearing comfort so
these are an Occam's oakum open
circumaural design which basically puts
them kind of like five five eight or
five nine eight in terms of what type of
headphone they are the transmitter
features digital analog inputs that's
actually kind of a cool feature to have
power on/off balance control volume
control ergonomic and adjustable
headband for an excellent secure fit
rechargeable integrated batteries
multi-purpose transmitter also functions
as an easy charge cradle and docking
stations so we're gonna open it up
they include instructions for how to
open it which are basically amount to
cut this and open this alright if these
are anything like some of the other
Sennheiser products I've encountered
they're gonna be a bit of a challenge to
to get open and Depak off' ID so inside
what do we find
alright they're heavy so there's that
hopefully most of the weight is the
docking station itself and not so much
the headphones because it's nice to have
a nice lightweight headphone design the
headphones themselves are powered by a
couple of triple-a batteries so I'm not
expecting that to add a ton of weight
sennheiser estimates a six to eight
hours operation time per charge so
they're giving you a number of different
plugs for the cradle itself there's the
one that I'll be using the North
American one as well as a power adapter
with cable and it looks like some audio
adapters as well there we go
look at that so we got RCA cables we've
got just a regular single that's I guess
they're intending you to use that as an
optical digital audio and then finally a
three and a half mil two RCA adapter so
that's what we've got inside there
next we've got another accessory box
very clever packaging on this one it
kind of hit all the accessory box and
little recessed spots in the plastic so
there's your Quick Start Guide showing
you the system that you just bought and
that's the only thing inside that box
next up we've got aa plastic popping
button bits here there we go
so now we have the base station itself
which charges the headphones like this
so you can see these two contact points
here on the top and then there are two
contact points here next to the
adjustable headband then we've got the
headphones themselves which look like
one of Sennheiser's more premium
products so on the mid-range and lower
end stuff you don't generally find you
know all the nice little chrome trims
and stuff like that now Sennheiser
saying these are open headphones which
basically amounts to often a more
natural sound particularly for those who
prefer open headphones but not everyone
does and it also means that you're going
to be more likely to hear ambient noise
and the people around you are more
likely to hear what you are listening to
so I'm hoping that the that the ear cups
are labeled own so you pop this out
before use so I'm guessing that allows
the batteries to make contact and there
we go they are clearly labeled on the
back left and right there's also some
controls on the back so you can change
your input turn them on and off and then
you can also adjust your volume the
balance and the volume down let's go
ahead and put these on and see how they
feel if I had to complain about
something it would be that the the
headband is a little bit on the narrow
side I do prefer a thicker head been
because I find it I distributes the
pressure of the headphones a little bit
better but with that said the ear cups
are very large to the point where they
don't even touch my earrings which hang
down under my ears so I think pretty
much no matter what size your ears are
you're not gonna have too much trouble
with that the controls are easy to reach
and because of the shape of them it's
pretty easy to tell what's what and
where so there's down there's up and
there's the on and off button right
there the ear cups are quite a hard foam
so you can see that they come
back very quickly see that so what I
suspect is that they wouldn't be
immediately super comfortable but after
a bit of a break-in period you shouldn't
have too much trouble with them much
like my older at five five five s so I
want to show you guys the base station
here's all the stuff you got friends and
outs so you can say you have an output
there's a pass-through there's your
input
there's your in a note for both optical
digital as well as coaxial digital you
can change the levels here you've got
your pairing button and your power in
and other than that it just felt okay so
there's your power it's touch sensitive
buttons on the front so there's your
power on there as well so you take that
off and the idea I guess would be for it
to kind of sit here or sit on sort of
presumably you'd have some kind of oh
that's bad whoops okay
and it's ruggedly built I hope anyway
you'd have it sitting on like a little
table next to your couch so that it's
ready to go at a moment's notice and I
think that pretty much wraps it up I
just want to see if there's any expects
so Sennheiser is claiming a 90 decibel
signal-to-noise ratio for the
transmitter base itself you don't have
the option to use the headphones wired
so they're purely Wireless so I don't
even know why they bother giving you an
impedance rating but there you go
they're 150 ohm headphones and I think
that's pretty much most of what people
will be concerned about
I wouldn't mind figuring out how to pop
the batteries out of here but it's
possible they actually don't really
intend for you to do that unless there's
some kind of a compelling reason that
you'd need to later on down the road
yeah there we go all right look at that
so one battery in there re psycho not
for retail sale look at you've got some
little custom batteries there and then
the other one is if I guess in the other
air cap there it goes so you just pop
this little guy off here pop up the
battery so if you didn't want to wait
for them to recharge you actually could
swap the batteries quite quickly and
painlessly don't forget to subscribe to
Linus tech tips for more unboxings
reviews and other computer videos and as
always make sure I mean I haven't tried
these but make sure you check out
reviews online and whatnot because what
I did see is that while I had there
weren't
any complaints about the audio quality
they were compared to something like a
five nine eight some people have been
having trouble with interference with
this particular headset and they've been
finding that it can disconnect from the
base station sometimes so make sure that
you don't have too much interference
before you go ahead and drop this kind
of money on them or here's another sort
of smart thing to do make sure you buy
them somewhere with a good return policy
so that if you do have trouble then you
can you can return them and get
something else</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
