accounts has no right to exist it was
seven years in the making
ways a shocking 100 pounds fully-loaded
and everything about it was
purpose-built from the 8 millimeter
thick aluminum motherboard tray to the
270 four screws required for its
assembly it's the brainchild of Charles
Harwood the creator of murder box and
fellow BC boy and integrates more PC
industry firsts than I can keep track of
including defused basement lighting
integrated comprehensive cable
management frameless cooling fans and an
utterly unique visual design that
doesn't scream performance so much as it
whispers it it's built to be the case
that you use for the next 10 years and
it's manufactured to the highest
standard but it comes with a price tag
that reflects its pedigree let's get up
close and personal with it
Roseville's closed-loop CPU coolers
feature a performance copper base pwm
fan speed control and more for an
affordable price
check him out today at the link below it
was ten years ago but I remember the day
I met this guy like it was yesterday
he drove two hours to pick up some $10
water cooling fittings from me because a
customer commissioned one of his already
famous murder box gaming machines and no
other fitting was good enough for him
it was this rejection of good enough
that drove Charles to do things the rest
of us thought were crazy
I still remember him explaining to me
that wires shouldn't be hidden they
should just be beautiful when he
unveiled the first individually sleeved
power supply no one is gonna spend that
kind of time and money on a power supply
I said but I think we all know how that
played out every one of his creations
was like that a work of art utterly
unique and always pushing the limits
whether it was tubing layouts lighting
or design with zero compromises on build
quality
unfortunately Charles had a problem
building a single murder box an 8,000 to
$18,000 machine often including in
person delivery is a two to four week
endeavor and that's assuming that
nothing goes wrong with sourcing and
building whatever cutting-edge new
design or material he's working on he'd
never get the parts production
economical like that the business model
had to shift that's where murder mod
came in
Charles partnered with Niels a pioneer
in the sleeving space to create a lineup
of aftermarket faceplates
mid plates mounts and other accessories
that would allow t jo7 owners to upgrade
their existing systems to something
worthy of the million dollar PC
galleries and these two business models
complemented each other well on paper
the higher margins and sales volumes of
accessories would help to absorb the
cost of prototyping and development
while the boutique system business would
give murder mod a high-profile avenue
for showing off at
latest creations except for another
small problem accessories are only
high-volume if they're compatible with
more than a single high-end case from
niche manufacturer silverstone and
they're only high margin if you have the
upfront funding and the know how to
navigate the quagmire of overseas mass
production so he forged a relationship
with silverstone with the plan of
bringing a tweaked and pre modded TJ o7
to market and then iterating from there
another great in theory idea that turned
into an endless cycle of prototyping and
refinement until finally four years
later thanks to a cash bailout from a
community member named Richard it was
ready to ship to the early backers every
component of the mark ii has a story
literally every one but i won't bore you
guys talking about the 50,000 unit
minimum order quantity on each
individual variation of the custom made
hex Chris let's start with the luminous
panel ten years ago PC lighting was done
with cheesy plastic cathode tubes with
cheap inverters that usually burned out
quite literally burned out in a year or
two there had to be a better way and the
inspiration came from runway fashion
shows now building a panel that looks
like this is easy if you have a bunch of
space behind it for light distribution
and diffusion but Charles had to do it
without taking up any of the space for
radiators on the bottom or for the
system itself on top so he ended up with
LEDs on one side firing into what he
calls the core a proprietary material
that he modified and etched with a grid
to project the light upward the
remaining three edges were lined with
reflective material to bounce back and
recycle the light that would normally
pass right through and be wasted a final
piece of semi translucent material was
added on top to diffuse the light giving
the finished luminance panel a glow
strong enough to be seen in daylight but
subtle enough to game next to at night
and add a thickness of just 15mm
the blood drips in the front have an
equally fascinating backstory the first
iteration was a murder mod faceplate a
very rudimentary solution to the tjo
sevens dated even then septuple five and
a quarter inch Bay design optical drives
were already on their way out it was
water cut and used an LED strip mounted
inside a Hammond project box reflecting
off a piece of white acrylic simple but
in the mark two the entire basement
where the TJ o7 mount storage drives by
default is taken up by up to six by 120
millimeters worth of radiators and the
power supply and the front is a modular
space that can be adapted for three and
a half inch storage water cooling
controllers pumps two and a half inch
storage a slim optical drive you pretty
much name it so there's potentially a
lot of stuff that has to go in there he
needed something more compact so Charles
created a lighting solution using only a
single LED firing upward through an
acrylic block with silver mylar edges
like the luminance panel but this time
using a piece of adhesive vinyl at the
back that's printed with a gradient
graphic on it to control light
reflection toward the front and a strip
of a photographic material called dura
trans to diffuse the light coming out
this combination ensures that the drips
fade to black effect will be perfect and
seamless even in complete darkness a
characteristic that not only looks sick
but also helps hide the optional stealth
slot load optical drive that you didn't
see that one coming
the top grille was also designed as a TJ
o7 nod that you could just drop into the
existing flange and was inspired by
ceiling fans why do we need frames in a
position where we don't need to create
static pressure to build this Charles
bought almost literally every cooling
fan on the market to find the ideal one
he needed a clean aesthetic the right
hub size easily removable fan blades in
case painting was required to match the
look of a particular build
and quiet operation out of the box
without fan control because there would
be no room for PWM wires in the tiny 2
by 4 millimetre wire management channel
every unit was shipped to kallen in
Australia where he painstakingly hand
assembled them this process involves
removing the fan frames removing the
existing wiring from the fan hub
soldering the new leads specially
designed for the top mount epoch seeing
in the hubs running the wiring around
the internally machined frame and
terminating to a single sleeved 3 pin
connector that will work with basically
any motherboard one of a kind looks and
drop in compatibility like this are
really really tough things to combine
which I guess brings us finally to mile
Terrier motive for making this video so
this video isn't sponsored I mean after
all the money he's lost on this Charles
couldn't afford our rates and I wouldn't
ask him anyway but there is something in
it for me I want to see what he'll
create next so I offered to do a profile
of the mark 2 and its history in hopes
that they'll all sell so he can repay
his investors and work on something new
there are 142 mark 2 cases left in the
world you'll find the where to buy link
in the video description the config that
we showed would run a whopping two
thousand US dollars but for this video
Charles and mod 1 created a more basic
limited time promotional bundle
including everything that you need to
get started the case it's 150 page user
manual and a quad radiator mount as well
as the optional luminance panel for
$12.99 it's still eye watering ly
expensive but there will never be
another production run of the mark 2 it
was a financial disaster for everyone
involved
so if you want to own a piece of PC
history the case equivalent of something
like a DeLorean
something only a fanatical person would
build well you know where to get it blue
