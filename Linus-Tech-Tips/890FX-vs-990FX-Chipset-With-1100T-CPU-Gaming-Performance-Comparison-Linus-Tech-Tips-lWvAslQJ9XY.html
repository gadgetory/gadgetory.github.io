what's the best gaming motherboard or
what's the best platform for gaming or
whatever the case may be what I usually
say to them is the best gaming
motherboard is the motherboard that has
all the features you want and fits all
the hardware you want to put on it but
just to demonstrate I thought I'd take a
couple of gaming motherboards and pit
them against each other this is going to
be a bit of an examination of the 990 FX
chipset versus the 890 FX chipset so
right here what I have in my hand is a
crosshair for formula you're gonna want
to come a little closer so I can show
you this part as well and the crosshair
for formula is an 890 FX board it's got
support for USB 3 via the back panel
it's got an am-3 socket dual channel
ddr3 up to 4 PCIe 16x slots although
you're running at 16 X is 16 X or at 16
X 8 8 for something along those lines
yep I think that's the deal
we've also got SATA 2 okay so the eight
nine the nine ninety F X version they
crosshair v formula has a bit of a
sharper aesthetic all these SATA ports
are changed over to SATA 3 6 gigabit per
second now we also have an additional
USB 3 front header to go with the 154
USB 3 back headers ok there's an am3+
socket which means that left support for
in these bulldozer 8 core CPUs when they
are released so basically what does that
mean in terms of its performance with a
current generation processor so I
thought I'd take some of the benchmarks
I did before this is it this is what the
6990 dual graphics video card or dual
chip video card you've got 8 gigs of RAM
my usual test bench and so I thought I'd
take my 1100 key benchmarks with the 890
FX platform and run them against the 990
FX to see how it goes so I'm almost done
and I'll show you guys the results when
I'm done and I think that if you have
been following how much of an impact
chipsets have on computer performance
these days you probably won't find these
results very surprising alright so
here's my results with the 890 FX versus
the 990
next chipset so I'm gonna leave off
Crysis 2 for now we're gonna return to
that but let's look at the Witcher so
yeah performs about eight percent better
dirt three the 99 dfx is a little slower
fear 3 they're identical Battlefield Bad
Company 2 the 990 FX is a little faster
instead of 5 it's a little faster so it
seems to me the board is slightly faster
for gaming although I can't really say
with certainty that these are
significantly different enough to to be
representative of the performance Delta
because I didn't do a ton of runs I've
had a lot of benchmarking to do this
weekend so this is pretty much within
the margin of error for most of them
although which are - I have very good
consistency on that benchmark I would
say that one's definitely out ahead and
sieve 5 is just a late-game view so that
one is definitely ahead and there were
they were distinctly different frame
rates as 30 constant 31 constants so
there's a not much room for error there
note 3 is a can benchmark so once again
although it's a can benchmark with AI so
it runs a race and sometimes the the AI
player places differently so depending
on how many cars are in front of it at a
time it could be slightly more or less
demanding now Crysis 2 this is a funny
one because I'm gonna have to go go back
at this because Crysis 2 I ran it with
the when I was originally doing this one
with the APU versus the 1100 t I ran it
with dual 69 70s and I was getting zero
scaling on this platform so I was like
okay forget it so that's when I switched
to the 6990 for my standardized
benchmarking platform now I got
reasonable scaling with the 690 so I was
like okay well I mean it didn't scale
great it went from like 40 to 49 fps and
then it you know this was appropriate
given this but then all of a sudden I
mean I reran this again and I got the
same results so for some reason this
platform performed way better in Crysis
2 so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
throw the crosshair 4 back on the test
bench and I'm gonna run Crysis 2 again
see what happened because I'm not even
reinstalling I'm not even changing any
drivers and changing absolutely nothing
about my Windows platform in order to
switch between 998
the effects because there are actually
very very very similar chipsets there's
almost no difference between them so
let's see what happens here guys well
every once in a while you run into these
bizarre things I just did my run-through
again and if nothing else there it is
forty-nine point one this reassures me
that my crisis to run through is fairly
consistent so forty-nine point one is my
new result so yeah you see this kind of
thing from time to time where a
particular setup is a little bit faster
in you know something then another one
even though they should be very similar
so the 990 FX crosshair 5 formula seems
to perform better in Crysis 2 with the
6990 than the crosshair for formula i
suspect it's just a quirk of my
particular setup like i remember i had
one of my old computers it was like a
939 socket 939 computer for some reason
never required a password for Warcraft 3
I never had to enter a CD key alright I
rather not never had then I never had to
enter the CD so it would run with uh
with an OCD even back before that game
would do it and you know I the computer
I had before that wouldn't do it and the
computer I upgraded to afterwards
wouldn't do it and it was just sort of a
quirk of that particular platform so
there you go so those are my results for
the 890 FX versus the 990 FX I would
pretty much call this probably some kind
of a weird glitch but the funny thing is
this is like significantly more playable
on this platform then like this is a
crappy yet 50 fps and this is a good 60
you can really feel it in those drops so
thank you for checking out my video on
the crosshair 5 formula versus the
crosshair 4 formula 990 FX 890 FX don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
for more unboxings reviews and other
computer videos and no yeah here's that
black socket indicating the am3+ a
compatibility very cool stuff
okay this is driving me crazy I'm gonna
do it one more time so I put the Christ
of the cross hair five back on the bench
firing up Crysis 2 again well guess I'll
have to restart before I do that and
then yeah I'm changing absolutely zero
game settings I checked gpu-z it's
running at 16x in this slot all of that
stuff so let's see what happens let's
see if I can reproduce these results I
gave well I figured it out here's my
result with the 990 FX so fifty point
eight so I can throw this guy out
because here's what happened the 990 FX
board is set to the wrong date in the
BIOS which caused my fraps results to be
out of order because I sort it by date
modified in order to make it simple for
me to see which is the last benchmark I
ran so the true result and it must have
been my imagination that it was running
smoother on here the true result is
around 50 fps and performance is
equivalent thank you for your patience
while I sorted out this little technical
matter and I guess thanks for coming
along on the ride don't forget to
