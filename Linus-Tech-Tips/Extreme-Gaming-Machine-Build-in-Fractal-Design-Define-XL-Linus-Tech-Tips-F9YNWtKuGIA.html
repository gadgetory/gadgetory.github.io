be twofold first of all I'm giving you
guys an update on that prototype machine
that crazy Russian was working on so
this is the define Excel with our dual
of GTX 580 s we've got the core i7 950
processor and now you can see I've got
the H 70 water cooling installed because
in order to keep doing our benchmarking
testing validation all that good stuff
we had to go ahead and put the system
together as intended so the first thing
I want you guys to notice is that the
temperatures even though we are running
Linux are still around 60 degrees on the
CPU now we're not overclocked yet but
even at dock speeds that is stock speeds
and voltage on that CPU we managed to
drop 20 degrees off the low temperature
in the CPU now bear in mind as soon as
you start overclocking that difference
between the stock cooler and a good
solid aftermarket cooler like the H 70
is going to be a lot more because that
heat load will overwhelm the stock
cooler whereas the H 70 can keep it
under control so I just want to show you
guys some of the features in the define
XL and why we chose it for this for this
particular bill first of all check out
these side panels I mean these must
weigh like wow this must weigh like a
few pounds each like nope no problem I
mean I think the case saw empty with no
hardware in it to follow the sound
dampening materials and the steel
construction weighs about 30 pounds so
it's very very heavy so it also means
it's very very solid there's absolutely
no flex to it whatsoever in terms of
features I'm going to go ahead and
remove that so this is the black version
of the case it's also available with a
titanium which is kind of like a like a
gunmetal gray front okay so I want to
show you guys all of the features I know
I've been promising to show you features
this whole time but what I've really
been doing is killing time so that I can
get around to the back of the case and
show it to you so you can cable things a
little bit more tightly at the back then
then we've done here the the reason for
this is that we're basically throwing it
together to do some prototype testing
this is not a finished production
machine so we'd have all these tied
together and we'd have them all sort of
tucked out of the way
but speaking of tucking cables of the
late look how much space you have at the
back like you see so many cases with
space designs so that you can
cut cables around the back but then
there's actually no gap like weave
action here here get around a little bit
further even you can see there's more
than an inch of space between these
drive cages and the side panel you can
tuck any cables back there same thing
behind the hard drives you've got like 2
inches of space to actually put your
cables in the back of the drives and
then tuck any extra cabling away out of
sight and out of mind so that's pretty
cool and so they've also got the
removable motherboard backplate I didn't
a full unboxing of the define XL once
already so you can see all the features
of it there so we're just gonna go
through like really quickly here so the
dual 140 millimeter front fans we still
have to install this one this is just an
in-progress shot because we took the 140
ml fan from the back where the H 70 is
now installed so it's here and we're
gonna go ahead and throw that in the
front for this build and speaking of
places to tie cables we've also got a
really cool place like you wouldn't be
able to tell that this power supply
isn't modular looking at this build from
any angle other than like way down here
where you can see that we've tucked a
bunch of cables up here so you've got a
ton of space to hide away your cables on
your power supply even if you're using a
non modular power supply overall spec of
the machine so I'll show you where we
mounted everything we've got arrestee in
here in one of the drive slider so you
can hold up to ten hard drives or ten
SSDs then we have our storage drive here
remember this is the performance Edition
so it has a storage drive it has the
bigger power supply it has the dual GTX
580 s it has the faster rim it has the
h7t instead of the age 50 and there's a
bunch of advantages to getting the
performance Edition build so yeah I mean
cable management is mostly been shown
you've got these little silicone guys
here you can see that unlike the define
are - they've been dramatically improved
on the define X what Excel as well as
the define our three so they're much
more Floop see for lack of a better word
and because with the old ones basically
as soon as you put something through it
they were kind of like stuck in that
position whereas these ones are much
easier to not like damaged and bends
there that was a long drawn-out way of
saying that they're a higher quality
higher quality Gromit and I think that
covers pretty much everything I wanted
to say I mean you can check out the huge
fan here on the top of the case so
you've got a ton of exhaust going out
the back of the case here all of that
hot air from the from the CPU cooler as
well as any air coming from around the
MOSFETs you've got nice airflow over the
RAM it's just taking all that and
blowing it out the back of the case so
thank you for checking out this little
video about the Vesta 6050 in progress
build as well as sort of an extreme
gaming machine build in the fractal
design define Excel hope you've sort of
got a pretty good idea what kind of
cooling features and hardware containing
features in this case has don't forget
