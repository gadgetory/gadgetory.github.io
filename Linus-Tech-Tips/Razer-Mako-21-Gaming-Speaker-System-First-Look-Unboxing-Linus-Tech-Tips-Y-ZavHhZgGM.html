for not checking how much film I had
before we started shooting this last
time so I have already broken some seals
which really gives me a headache cuz I
hate breaking seals on something I like
to do all my unboxings in one take
however we do have to reattempt this one
so today I'm having a look at the razor
Makos as you can well enough imagine
these are speakers based on how big the
box it is and what is unique about these
speakers are a couple of things that are
all focused on guess what gaming it's
Razer it's for gaming ok so first things
first is the way the speakers are
designed they are firing downward and
then you can see the speaker grilles are
actually go around the speaker's so what
that means is whether you're sitting
close or whether you're sitting to the
right or to the left of these speakers
the positioning is accurate which is so
important if you want to know where a
sound is coming from I mean that's
important to a lot of music enthusiasts
but it's also very important to gamers
because that way you know where the
footsteps are coming from etc etc they
are only a 2.1 set so you're not gonna
have full surround but what you will
have is at least the same degree of
accuracy you would get out of that set
of headphones speaking of headphones one
of the other things that this speaker
set is designed to do very well is
output to headphones so we have an
amplified headphone jack on the control
puck itself and you can see this is a
touch sensitive control buck we'll show
that to you in a minute and when I find
it inside but that's particularly
important if you're using something like
the PC 350 s from sennheiser these are
quite a high impedance headset and high
impedance means that you need more power
to drive it so if you have an amplified
headphone jack it means that you're
gonna get overall better sound quality
out of it so overall this is a 300 watt
thx speaker set which is fairly
unimportant as far as specs go but it's
always good to know approximately what
kind of wattage to expect overall and
something that I have never
seen before is this the Oh
cameraman scoffing okay the speaker
wires themselves look like Ethernet
cables there's a warning on here do not
insert this beef sucker cables into an
Ethernet LAN port and I hope you're not
dying back there okay I've been given
the thumbs up and so these are your
speaker caters next inside we have
another warning do not connect this wire
to a monitor or PC graphics port so this
is a VGA port however what we're gonna
find on the other side of it is with the
nice little rubber base here is the
control puck so it comes with a little
plastic cover on it
I've gone and ripped I'm gonna try and
get the whole thing off here but we've
got all of our basic controls on the top
so you've got your line one line to mute
base and volume and the volume indicator
is I believe here based on the picture
we are you saw a nice rubberized razor
link oh there's your headphones and
you're lying in okay so the next cable
we're gonna find is just a standard
power cable okay
so there's nothing particularly
exceptional about that just three prong
power plug cable well to prom to prom
okay and then the next thing we find is
a three and a half mil two three and a
half mil plug so I guess we'll figure
out what that's for later all right so
let's get down to these speakers
themselves so inside the protective foam
which is quite thick no no thinner than
about an inch on any side we will find
the subwoofer and the two satellite
speakers so let's see here we've got I
don't know what this is some kind of
documentation so maybe
we'll have a look at that before we
actually get to the speaker's themselves
and the main one here is the Mako Master
guide okay so this is in a few different
languages shows you how to set up your
Makos gives you some guidelines for the
positioning relative to each other on
the table connect to how to connect them
doo-doo-doo-doo and what you can connect
them to then it moves on to different
languages also inside here you will find
a couple Razer stickers okay the I
believe these are UV reactive as well
which is kind of cool as well as a short
introductory booklet okay so this
explains the technology that's used in
the Mako as well as how to operate them
briefly okay so let's get to satellite
first they're not actually all that
heavy I was kind of expecting them to be
a little bit heavier based on the looks
of these speakers but yeah I guess
they've got a little bit of heft to them
but I'm not too heavy okay so here's our
THX logo right on the front of the
speaker and then on the front of the
speaker there's a little bit more of a
grille here but you can see that the
grille actually goes the main one goes
all the way around the speaker here's
that Ethernet jack I mean one thing I
don't like about this is it means that
you can't substitute any other cable for
it so yeah it's kind of an odd design
decision but I mean the cables that are
included look reasonably long so it's
not really something to worry about too
much we've got a Razer logo on the top
and that is the satellite itself it's
kind of a different looking speaker but
I like that so very very stylish looking
so let's pull up the sub itself now I've
owned a fair number of PC speakers in my
in my day including the clips for media
ultra five-point ones I had some
creative are they the s7
OS at one point and so I've seen some
pretty big PC subs this is not one of
them this is a fairly modest sub this is
about what you'd expect for a high-end
2.1 system so here is where you will
find most of the business end of this
particular system so there you go that
line one that cable I saw before
for plugging into your PPC sound card
duh okay here's the cable port for the
control pod here is all this is kind of
nice so the line one line two means you
can have two separate inputs plugged in
at the same time so it's just a
right-left for something like a DVD
player our console might be something
you want to plug in okay there's your
right and left speaker outputs your
on/off switch and then your power in so
as with the speaker itself I don't know
if the camera can see this but you can
see right through it so the speaker
itself is housed and pointing down from
the top okay and then you can see right
through the grille that once again goes
all the way around the speaker there's a
few there's a Razer logo on the top well
that's quite heavy now that I'm actually
holding it for a while felt light to
start with and then at the bottom
there's three rubber feet so thank you
for checking out my unboxing and product
