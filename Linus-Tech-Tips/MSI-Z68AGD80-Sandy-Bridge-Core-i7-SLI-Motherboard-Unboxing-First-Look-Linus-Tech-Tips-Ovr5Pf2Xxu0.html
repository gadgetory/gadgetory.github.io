of the msi z68 a GD atv-3 motherboard so
the z68
a GD 8 eb 3 motherboard features their
military class 2 concept which means
they have the Superferry chokes the hi-c
caps with the tantalum core which is
very rare evidently you have solid caps
with up to a 10 year lifetime of solid
use as well as their OC Genie technology
USB 3 SATA 6 SLI crossfire X and full
support for intel's full lineup of Intel
Core i3 i5 i7 processors on LGA 1155 it
features a three-year warranty
in Canada and the US and in other
regions I have no idea so here there's
just a little bit more explanation of
what military class 2 means as well as a
list of their features including their
wink III which is like a quick OS you
can login to in the BIOS if you want to
browse the internet or phone Skype or
load windows for whatever reason super
charger so you can charge your iPad
iPhone and mobile at high speed even
when your PC is shut down that's a cool
feature as well as their instant
overclocking which is obviously tied in
to OC Genie which is their one button
overclocking press the button your
overclocked remember OC Genie only works
with K series processors though okay
three PCI Express 16x slots for up to
three way crossfire or two-way SLI and
finally overclock in one second OC Genie
- yes so others detect overclock CPU
memory oh and the integrated GPU now
remember with the z68 chipset the
integrated GPU clock speed is actually
going to matter even if you're using a
dedicated graphics card and the reason
for that is that the z68 chipset allows
you to use the integrated GPU to
accelerate video encoding so that's
pretty cool so that will affect that
performance okay here we have extreme
power design so twelve phases we have
dr. Moss as well as an extra six pin VGA
power connector for providing
more power to the PCIe slots we have two
BIOS chips just in case one of them has
some kind of a problem maybe during
flashing or whatever the case may be you
will have no problem restoring from the
second BIOS chip
let me just pull the board out see we've
got some nice environmentally friendly
packaging going on here I'm just gonna
move that supercharger okay so the
supercharger USB ports are month you
know I'll show you the accessories first
when it'll go through the other features
so here is a little map of the board and
as well as some key points about the
board that you can find on the box if
you so desired drivers and utilities DVD
throat away download the latest off the
msi website you've got m connectors
which are an easier way to plug in your
front USB and front panel connectors
quick installation guide
one two three four SATA three six
gigabit per second cables which are not
different except that they are white and
then you have two molex to SATA power
cables IO shield V chat cables so this
board features V check which means that
you can use a digital multimeter to
manually check the voltages going some
of the key components we have an SLI
bridge remember your crossfire bridge
should be included with your graphics
card USB three rear panel header with an
internal internal pin out okay just in
case your case doesn't have extra five
front USB three and you still want to
use the extra ports so you've got a user
guide as well as a software user guide
alright
the board itself
now we are so military class to sticker
comes off and oh this is interesting
looks like they've changed the they've
changed the socket cover from what they
were using before which was a piece that
goes under so I don't even know how this
one works
like that there okay that's how first
take off our OC Genie two things and
let's have a look at the board so why
don't we start in the CPU socket area so
here's where your LGA 1155 CPU goes that
will give you full support as I said
before for core i3 Core i5 and core i7
processors here's your 12 phase power
design as well as your tantalum core
little guys here so that's part of the
military class 2 concept which is
prominently featured on the branding on
the board we've got our 8 pin CPU
connector up here in its ideal location
in the top left corner big fan of that
personally as well as for ddr3 slots for
dual channel memory we've got our 24-pin
connector and it's ideal location along
the right-hand edge as well as V
checkpoints here so we have checkpoints
for the VC CP CP u v TT CPU GFX so
that's the onboard VGA VCC DDR as well
as PCH what is that
PCH 1 p0 v interesting as well as 2
ground points alright moving down we
have two SATA 3 6 gigabit router hold on
hold on just a minute SATA 5 6 so that's
before yeah Tuesday 3 6 gigabit per
second for SATA 2 3 gigabit per second
then we have an additional SATA 3 6
gigabit per second running off of a
third-party controller alright here are
our front USB ports this is the one with
supercharged the one with the red
background behind it I don't know if you
can see that red background can you okay
and then we've also got our USB 3 front
panel header OC Genie button power reset
another oh no this is firewire front
panel header our front audio as well
as our PCIe slots so PCIe slot layout
we've got one two three PCIe 16x slots
we have two PCIe 1x slots and two PCI
slots so if you are installing three
dual slot cards you will have left now
you've got to make sure you have a case
that has an additional PCI slot because
it's going to hang over the edge but you
will be left with one PCIe 1x slot and
one PCI slot so that's very rich
expansion capabilities if you're running
a threeway graphics card configuration
if you're running a two-way graphics
card configuration you're gonna be left
with one PCIe one one PCI and one PCIe
16 here's that PCI Express 6 pin power
connector right here so if you are
running a few graphics cards you're
probably gonna want to plug that in to
make sure that you're providing all the
juice you need to your graphics cards
here on the back the i/o shield we have
one of those ps2 keyboard mouse combo
ports we have optical audio out a reset
CMOS which I love the reset seamless
switch on the back I owe that big fan of
that ok we have one two three four
really four USB 2.0 ports that's it ok 4
USB 2.0 ports we have eSATA firewire
dual Gigabit Ethernet two USB 3.0 ports
so that is still a total of six USB
ports we have DVI out as well as HDMI
out and 7.1 audio out so thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the z68 a GD
atv-3 and let me just see if there's
anything that I missed here I don't
think there is don't forget subscribe to
