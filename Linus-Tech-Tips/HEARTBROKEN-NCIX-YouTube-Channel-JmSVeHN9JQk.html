recently you might have noticed that
we've been building a new set here in
the studio and that is not because we
just love manual labor
we are expanding our content lineup
which in regular speak means we are
making a new show it will run Monday
Wednesday Friday ish and it'll cover
stem news in a fun and rapid-fire manner
all we need now
someone who's got time to host it got
some free time no do you want to be a
video host are you in my office
don't and coltie baby the coach there
you want to host a new show got a new
show tech news needs a host we gotta
shoot a new show you in hosting Haley
Riley is that you
hallelujah but prayers have been
answered
I've got a host for the new channel come
on out here baby and I've got a sponsor
for this one this video is brought to
you by private Internet access
P ia is the VPN service that gives you a
safe protected IP and encrypts your
Internet traffic check it out now at the
link in the video description
oh my god Riley what are you doing in
here you remember how to host videos
right oh my god
no you hosted a tech show for like four
years
come on let's let's get you cleaned up
come on
so there's been a lot of speculation
over the last six months about us buying
out the NCIX tech tips YouTube channel
and confession time we have been working
on it so I made an initial offer which
was when I found out about the pending
buyer but I'm a shareholder or I'm on
the board of directors or something I
don't know it made no sense to me
whatsoever so so to say that I was
pretty cheesed off by this point would
be a gross understatement so any
purchaser of the rest of the company or
a creditor or even that individual with
the login credentials could challenge my
ownership due to some weird loopholes
that are specific to intellectual
property law and they kind of make sense
because if frankly it's not even worth
what I was offering at this point but I
mean for me I already had the host and
it's kind of like monopoly right like
it's worth it to overpay for Park Place
if you've already got boardwalk so long
story short there's actually been a very
emotional ride for me because I had
really wanted to bring my old stomping
ground back to its former glory like the
last thing that
I wanted to see with some company that
doesn't understand the audience doesn't
understand YouTube and doesn't
understand how much sweat blood and
tears went into making that what it is
just upload marketing videos to it but
even after over five thousand dollars in
legal fees and many hours especially
from Yvonne she worked really hard on
this we just couldn't make it happen so
I'm honestly I'm sorry to everyone I'm
sorry to everyone who was involved in
the deal the viewers who really wanted
to see it come back and just sort of in
general but there's a silver lining so
we actually made the deal to hire Riley
as soon as there was some hint as soon
as we got a sniff of getting the channel
so what we've decided to do is to just
go forward with a brand new show a
spiritual successor so it'll be a host
and maybe it'll be me maybe it'll be
Riley who knows media cult no host I
don't care and the host will be kind of
standing here like this no no not like
that like this
that's right boom and what its gonna be
in a nutshell is on a new channel we're
gonna call the channel tech linked yeah
that really is the best we could come up
with every episode will be about five to
six minutes long on Mondays Wednesdays
and Fridays and it'll cover the biggest
tech stories of the day and it's going
to be sort of sort of like this chip
maker best micro devices has announced
that they are going to be purchasing
finally the graphics accelerator design
company ATI for a cool five point four
billion dollars rumors about the
possible sales been flying around for
months and apparently Andy decided to go
through with it
but as ATI is stock price on the market
soared and these dropped due to investor
concern that AMD paid too much for the
acquisition kind of like you right she
had no choice but to say that it's great
by ATI will allow AMD to offer
integrated graphics on their CPUs giving
them an edge over rival Intel reportedly
AMD initially tried to purchase graphics
giant Nvidia but its CEO Jensen Thuong
insisted that he lead the new company
and AMD chief Hector Ruth wasn't having
any of that so AMD set its sights on ATI
instead and pulled the trigger the gun
went ah this is so redundant how many
times you can say they did the deal and
just like shooting someone in real life
that decision has haunted AMD efforts so
it's gonna be kind of like that except
current news not news from 12 years ago
