brought to you by phantom glass visit
store phantom dot glass for the best
iron screen protectors out there as well
as HyperX LG's big push at the show for
TVs this year is 4k OLED so they've got
a really cool demo behind me that really
I think explains some of the advantages
of OLED very visually so on their left
you've got a traditional LED backlit LCD
so you've got the actual back panel
you've got a diffuser sheet for the
backlighting so that it's just that you
don't just have like bright spots in the
middle of the panel you know you ever
heard a backlight bleed well that's the
kind of thing that is inherent with a a
backlit design that then it has a panel
in front of it that has to turn the
pixels black in order to try to block as
much light as they can to produce black
well you can never reach black that way
with an OLED panel the one that I have
here on my left well all there is is the
back cover of the TV and the OLED panel
because it emits its own light and each
pixel can be turned off individually for
effectively black or infinite contrast
but of course they don't expect you to
take their word for it behind me is the
OLED experience room where they've got
their own
LED backlit LCD TV with localized
dimming which is a way that LCDs can try
to achieve better black levels at least
in certain parts of the screen where the
image is darker for better effective
contrast it'll kind of like a voodoo
trick that I've never personally really
liked and I usually turn off and then
they've got that next to an OLED TV
where this the the imagery they have of
this sweet little piece of motorcycle
art demonstrates extremely well how the
black parts of the image really are
black instead of that grey that you've
come to expect from anything that is not
able to individually turn off the pixels
but oh that's about more than just
improved black levels and you know
vibrant colors and all that kind of
stuff through the use of what is
effectively a simpler physically overall
design they're able to do some really
cool stuff like this now this isn't the
first time we've seen LG show off a TV
that's actually flexible and with the
push of a button can be changed from
flat to curved but this is the first
time that they're showing us something
that is going to be a product this year
now there's no model number yet there's
no price or anything like that but
they're telling us that the 77 inch OLED
TV that can be adjusted from all the way
flat to actually quite curved is going
to be available this year as part of
their 9900 series looks freakin amazing
in person and this addresses one of the
issues that I have with curved TVs in
general in that you're stuck in the
situation where you've got a sweet spot
or you've got distorted sort of a
distorted view of the TV
well now depending how far away your
couch is how many people need to be in
the sweet spot you can actually adjust
it by adjusting the curve that's not
going to be cheap though so that's cool
TVs that we don't know how much they
cost and they have like space-age
technology and the motor people actually
more likely to be buying this year for a
4k TV probably one of the flat IPS
models that are going to be a lot more
affordable and are still coming with
some new innovations so first of all
with color prime LG's upping the ante in
terms of color reproduction they're also
improving contrast they're adding 4k
upscaling as well as improving viewing
angles with their IPS technology which
you guys have been following our channel
for any period of time you're probably
familiar with how much we love IPS but
I've got Kevin here to tell me what
they're doing on the software side to
make their Smart TVs a little bit more
smart yeah we're really really proud of
our webOS platform we launched it last
year actress yes so you remember seeing
it since then we've launched and sold
over 5 million web assets globally so
really excited about the success this
year we're bringing webOS 2.0 and what
that brings is enhanced speed we're at a
multi-core processing to actually speed
up the start up time and switching time
by 50% we're also keeping that
easy-to-use interface that customers
have known to love well there you go
easier and faster I guess it doesn't
really get much better than that does it
that's it but as much fun as it is to
look at what you can buy today or even
later on this year
well CES wouldn't be the same without
the stuff that there is no model number
no model name no estimated release time
no nothing you got it he got a look at
that stuff too so this is what they're
calling the world's first ninety eight
inch 8k color prime ultra HDTV you can
see how interesting it is to people even
if we're filming they're like and in
there with their cameras and all that so
this is
I'm essentially a 98 inch TV that runs
at 16 times the pixel count of 1080p
four times the pixel count of 4k has no
consumer interface that exists that
would be able to drive this kind of
resolution but it's just here for the
sheer wow factor of it all we're going
to get our cameras closest we're going
to allow us to they don't let us pass
the little barricade here we're going to
show you guys how find that images but
basically this would almost be usable
from like monitor viewing distances as
opposed to TV viewing distances speaking
of viewing distances if you're looking
at your phone ever and you want it to
not get scratched up and still be you
know super you're crystal clear and have
a nice satisfying feel you might want to
check out store dot phantom dog glass
phantom glass is powering us here at the
show they make the best iron screen
protectors out there they go on
bubble-free and they're super durable
made of Gorilla Glass also want to give
a shout-out to HyperX those guys have
some great content over on their YouTube
channel youtube.com slash HyperX got a
lot of great great gaming stuff we've
got links to both of those guys in the
video description don't miss any of our
CES content by making sure you're
subscribed and we'll see you at the next
booth or suite or wherever it is our
journey takes us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
