powered by HyperX check out their cloud
to headset in the link of the
description down below also thank you to
a soos and Corsair alright guys welcome
to the Razr booth where we checking out
the NZXT s340 designed by Razer so you
guys probably remember the H 440
designed by Razer
this one looks generally similar in
terms of the Razer styling but we'll get
more into that later on this is a case
that's about 25% smaller than that one
so if you were going for the Razer green
theme and but wanted a smaller case well
here you go this case will probably
remind you a lot of NZXT cases in
general it has a nice sleek basement
which is going to cover your power
supply and a lot of your cable
management and on top of that basement
you have two really beautiful looking
SSD mounts this case however does
abandon certain things like the rubber
grommets covering certain holes a lot of
the cutouts in here are just raw cutouts
and then there's a reservoir mount which
is covering some of your runs like your
24-pin your USB 3 connector and probably
your SATA cables on that reservoir mount
we have a non illuminated Razer logo so
that's where we're gonna begin with our
Razer logo stylings in the front of the
case you can fit up to two 140
millimeter fans and probably your
radiator in the top of the case you can
fit a 120 millimeter or 140 millimeter
fan and in the back of the case you can
fit a 120 millimeter fan there's a
beautiful tinted window which covers
most of these out of the case so you can
see into basically everything except for
the basement which makes sense because
you're looking at a basement so who
really cares it's largely steel
construction although it is soft touch
around the whole thing in terms of the
top IO and you've got a hard drive
activity LED mic input headphone input
two USB ports these are USB 3.0 ports
and they're green which is kind of a
nice touch considering it's too designed
by Razer case and a power button which
is illuminated by again a green logo
then on the front of the case on the
nice plane front because there's no five
and a quarter inch base which I'm
actually totally down with because I
haven't installed an optical drive and a
computer in a very long time it's again
soft touch and then with an illuminated
Razer logo then on the bottom of the
case it has
glow as if you're playing like
underground - back in the day but I
think it actually looks pretty sick
there's green under glow one on each
kind of side of the case moving to
behind the motherboard there's not a ton
going on here there is a bunch of loops
for zap straps so you can manage your
cables though so you should have not too
bad of a time as long as you do have
some sap jobs laying around one thing
that I must say that I like about this
case is that it's green yeah it's
designed by Razer obviously it's going
to be green but we see these days a lot
of black and red or a lot of white kind
of style builds and having a green build
is still very unique and I must say I
like that thanks for watching our
content thank you to HyperX for sending
us here this year you should check out
