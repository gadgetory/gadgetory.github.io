one task only like this 10 gigabit
network card it only does networking and
my car for example is only good for
making other people jealous conversely
this XPS laptop is excellent at nothing
really but it is OK at many things so is
it like a Swiss Army knife useful in
almost any situation or is it like a
Swiss Army knife when all you really
wanted was a real knife
speaking of useful today's video is
brought to you by madrenas madrenas
coffee blends specialty cold brew coffee
Zin two 16-ounce grab-and-go cans for
everyone's convenience check them out
and use offer code linus to say 40% at
the link below
whether you go for the core i5 or the
core i7 model you will immediately
notice the snappy performance of the
four core low-power processor but what
really separates this puppy from other
non gaming laptops is the integrated
Bega GPU to be clear this is not
explicitly a gaming laptop you would
need a discrete GPU in a fatter heavier
form factor for that so don't expect to
be playing any triple-a titles at 1080p
ultra details but it ain't no scrub
either gaming on this machine is a night
and day difference compared to Intel's
own integrated graphics and lighter
competitive like eSports games can break
60fps on it but it'll work up a sweat
when it does the CPU can redline at a
hundred degrees and you will always
notice the keyboard getting
uncomfortably hot over fifty degrees by
our measurements while gaming even
though the clock speed gets
significantly reduced when the CPU and
GPU are both being stressed at the same
time because due to the way they're
designed they actually have to share
their power ok so it performs better
than a thin in light but it's not that
thin in light and worse than a gaming
laptop but it's not that thick so all of
this makes sense and you got to think
about this in a two-in-one Machine
gaming performance is purely just a
bonus and the XPS 2 and 1 is really
intended as a day-to-day laptop so sure
it's a little on the heavy side and if
I'm being honest the design is anything
but edgy but I'm willing to forgive
boring design when you open up a machine
and you get to feel some of the best
build quality available today the screen
and the chassis are both exceptionally
rigid and like what Apple did in 2016
Dell has completely
removed the USB type a ports but I'm not
mad because unlike Apple they included
for type-c ports two of which are
Thunderbolt three that's something
that's hard to complain about in the
2018 dongle era as for the screen it's
excellent
fantastic colors really high brightness
and touch functionality whoo
I'd actually recommend though going with
the 1080p version instead of the 4k one
because at this size even side-by-side
it's not that easy to tell the
difference with my eyes but with my
wallet with my wallet I can tell moving
down Dell has created a completely new
type of keyboard for the XPS two-in-one
and that's dangerous because I already
likes Dells keyboards a lot so they're
calling this maglev and it's meant to
give you a lot of tactile feel despite a
very short throw distance and actually
okay the risk was worth it it took a
little bit longer to get used to than
normal it's having a bit of trouble
feeling the different keys given how
close they are to the key bed but once I
got rolling I was able to type extremely
quickly and hopefully these maglev keys
don't stop working at the first sign of
dust going further down the line we get
to the touch pad which is one of the
many things about this laptop that is
good but not excellent it's sizable but
it has poor palm rejection by default
though that can be fixed by tweaking the
settings and unfortunately the settings
won't help you solve some annoying
acceleration issues it's something that
you'll probably get used to but for us
where we're using a lot of laptop
side-by-side it does stand out next in
the pile of things that are kind of math
is the extra hundred dollars for the
Dell pen it provides a fairly good
writing experience but it just doesn't
feel as natural as the surface pen
which has a softer tip with a bit of
give and a tiny bit more friction which
makes writing notes and drawing feel a
lot more natural so if you were getting
a tune one primarily for drawing you
might still want to consider the surface
lineup and two Dells credit short of
inserting it inside the chassis this is
far and away the best attachment
mechanism well that we've seen bringing
us to yet another complaint the speakers
sound pretty good at lower volume but
they do start distorting at around fifty
percent and at full volume sounds just
plain bad and it has one of those
abominable chin bar webcams which is
fine if you flip the screen around and
use a webcam like this but if I was on a
conference call and I was trying to take
notes with my keyboard all the other
participants would see is my fingers
speaking of fingers it's a good thing
that it has a fingerprint reader built
into the power button because if I want
it to unlock using the windows hello IR
camera that it actually has I would end
up adjusting my screen basically every
time future-proof miss isn't a strong
point of this thing either
besides the storage basically nothing in
here can be upgraded or replaced so make
sure that you get the specs you want
including RAM up front and by the way
this massive 75 watt hour battery only
got us five hours in our work battery
life test a fairly average result so
then I've complained about quite a bit
over the last six minutes or so but
these are the sacrifices that come with
a laptop that is able to do everything
and don't get me wrong
overall I actually quite liked the XPS
15 two and one what other device gives
you excellent touch support lots of
performance a beautiful screen super
high build quality and pretty good
battery life all in one
okay the surface book - which also has a
better keyboard and a discrete GPU and
on a level playing field yeah come to
think of it I would choose the surface
but the pricing of the XPS saves it with
what we'd call our recommended loadout
coming in at $1500 it's not really a
budget option but it is a full five
hundred dollars cheaper then the
cheapest surface book that we think is
even worth looking at so for someone
that needs a dual Dahl device and can
live without full dedicated graphics the
XPS 15 two and one looks like a solid
all-rounder option speaking of a solid
option King does mobile phone service
differently there's no contracts no
overage fees and no other carrier tricks
you just pay a fair price for the talk
text and data that you end up using each
month King gives you full control over
your cell phone account - allowing you
to set alerts and caps for each device
on your account
to keep your usage in check and
nationwide LTE coverage means that
you'll get great network coverage from
coast to coast almost any phone will
work with ting from that ancient
Motorola RAZR sitting in your basement
to the latest Galaxy S nine or iPhone 10
so check out your phone's compatibility
at Linus dot ting comm and while you're
over there get twenty-five bucks off
your bill or towards a new phone in the
ting shop so thanks for watching guys if
