brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with corsair Memory and
western digital hey guys we're here the
Narada booth was something that I almost
walked right past this is mad genius and
they're amazing amazing controller so
what can you tell me about it what we
have is a motion controller acceptance
based on absolute positioning where most
controllers are based on acceleration
and what this does is it lets us know
where the player is in the room with an
accuracy of a hundredth of an inch and
we can break the controller in half so
we can track each of their hands
independently so we can track things
like if a player shoots a bow or does
other things we can track each side of
it separately and we can track that with
accuracy of one hundreds of an inch
which allows the player to aim with
absolute precision and no sensor drift
we can get that last little bit when
they zoom in on the target we can see
that motion and the tracking is enough
that we can tell the difference between
if the player is breathing or if they're
not for some really tight shots it's
better to hold your breath just like it
is with an actual bow or an actual gun
it adds a different feel to the game
because it it becomes about how well can
you aim how well can you move it's not
just putting the crosshairs on something
and pushing a button the tracking is
also optimized for an area about 8 feet
wide about 12 feet deep now so the
player can move anywhere in that area in
front of the TV and what we do is we
link that to the character movement of
the game so as the player moves around
the character moves with them so they
can duck behind an object literally step
to the side to step out shoot somebody
and then step back and hide again while
they reload and it adds a completely
different field of the game if they need
to move further all of the six and
buttons are still active so we haven't
removed any controls that they're used
to we just add the motion if they want
it and if they don't want the motion
they put the two halves back together
and they have a standard controller like
they always have the two house putting
about together and taking apart those
are really easy to do because it's based
on magnets and something you told me
earlier actually was because of how
absolute the positioning is actually too
you can tell because while you're
holding it there's a little bit of drift
because your body is naturally moving in
tiny amounts and it's
accurate that if some type of you if you
put it down and pointing at the screen
it will be exact which is pretty
interesting now another thing we talked
about when you brought up if you pulled
it apart and went like this you could be
shooting a bow you can make custom
controls for this so how would you go
about doing that we have a motion editor
and you can pull that up and you can
edit the motion design that we've done
or you can create your own and that's
how the motions for the controller can
be customized to the game and this is
done without any hardware modification
of the console and without any
additional software in the console so it
can go back on any console and play
existing games it's backwards compatible
with the games they're already out there
because you don't need an additional
software solution make the game work so
we've gone as far back as ps1 games I've
done Gran Turismo and a ps1 and it works
just fine with that we've actually gone
as far back as the original Castle
Wolfenstein and which looks kind of
clunky blocky now but you can link into
anything and you know with a lot of the
new motion controllers that are coming
out they have an API that the game
developer needs to write to for it to
work and I wanted this to work right out
of the box so you can pull it out of the
box play the games already have and you
know in the future would be creative
game developers would write for it but
if not you still have your entire
library that can play differently I
think that's really cool because there's
a lot of technologies coming out lately
like Toby eye-tracking that we've seen
in oculus and all these other things
that while they're awesome they require
a lot of development on the game makers
side and with all these technologies
coming out it's going to be hard for
people to properly develop for
everything that's available to them so
when a device like this comes out and
the hackers in the community can just
come out and make their own profiles
upload them to the cloud and allow you
to download them yourselves it's a lot
easier for game makers because while if
they want to they can pre packaged it or
they can add it later really easily or
if they have someone really enthusiastic
in their community that they're nowhere
is already going to make a really good
profile they can just rely on that which
is really cool what's your favorite part
about this device or what is anything
you feel like we've left out so far um
there's one thing that it's difficult to
get through when you're watching it but
it's something that really happens when
you play is when you have that level of
control something as simple as shifting
your weight left to right and the
character moves with you there's a
connection that makes with your brain
and everyone who does it the first time
there's a slouch with it because you're
like oh I'm connected into it
and it's little things like that that
changed the gaming experience and so
this isn't necessarily about counting
milliseconds or a competitive advantage
it's about feeling a little more
connected with the game as controllers
awesome there's a billion different
things you can do with it I'm really
excited for how easily and seamlessly it
integrates with games they're going to
be having a Kickstarter in a while I
think she said somewhere around a pole
or februari but don't quote me on that
go to their website look up mad genius
you'll find it and there's an input
field for your email if you put your
email in there they will email you in
their Kickstarter is live this is
definitely something I'm going to be
getting behind as I love different ways
of interacting with computers or
consoles or whatever if you can interact
with it differently I'm all over it I
was all over Austin xenia solver oculus
all this kind of stuff so I'm super
excited for this device thank you for
