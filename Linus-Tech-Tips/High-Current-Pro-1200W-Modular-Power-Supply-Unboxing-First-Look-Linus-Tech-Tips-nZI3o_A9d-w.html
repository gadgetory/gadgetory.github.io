antics uber espouse supply ever this is
the high current Pro 1200 watt it is an
SLI ready yeah duh
SLI ready 80 plus gold certified 1200
watt power supplies so the first thing
we're going to do is start ripping open
the packaging and then we're going to
show you the packaging then we're going
to take off the box and then we're going
to show you the product itself actually
I lied today we're going to open the box
right away
because I'm actually really excited to
see this thing this is from everything
that I've seen pretty much the king of
power supplies right now alright the
first thing we're going to find inside
is the HCP 1200 product overview most of
the information here appears to be
already on the outside of the box so you
can decide whether you want to read the
documentation inside the box or the
documentation outside the box now and
next packaging I have to admit felt a
little flimsy to me initially but now I
can see why they're doing that the
reason that it felt that way is because
they've actually tacked it using
environmentally-friendly cardboard so
they've gone with two double walled
layers of cardboard on all sides of the
power supply it fits together like a
little puzzle so if we go ahead and pull
the whole thing out you can see that's
how it goes together and so
realistically it's gonna provide
adequate protection versus something
like foam but it's also a lot less
damaging to the environment because it
doesn't take so long to break down in a
landfill or wherever else it happens to
be it's also completely recyclable so it
shouldn't end up in a landfill I guess
that's an equally valid point alright
first thing let's do accessories we've
got the power cable which as you can see
is thick this thing is huge I'm just
going to try and find three yes 14 AWG
but it is a normal power cable so it
doesn't use that special connector that
we saw on the Quattro 1200 OC alright
we've got four black screws for mounting
in your case I like those little touches
black screws just have slightly better
fit and finish overall when you're doing
a really nice bill Bend silver ones
especially if you're using a black case
which most of the high-end ones these
days are all right in here we have some
modular cables I don't know if I
mentioned already but this power supply
does have cable management or modular
cables all right so why don't we show
the mullets no let's show the power
supply first and then we'll show the
modular cables I did want to cover some
of the stuff that an Tek has to say for
themselves on the box here so I'm just
gonna put the box back together and show
you guys this side first all right so it
has Universal input that means there's
no little switch all right it has eight
six plus two pin connectors so that
means up to four high end graphics cards
it's multi-core ready high current
output 30 amps times eight so it has
eight 12-volt rails that are rated at 30
amps for their over current protection
mind you I've seen this power supply
tested providing up to 40 amps on one
rail so it looks like they've built in a
fair bit of wiggle room for any kind of
improvements to hardware that make it
draw more power on one rail like I say
for example even higher in graphics
cards that are coming alright alright 12
April okay that's what I said and then
we've also got 2 8 pin power connectors
so that means that we're certified for
EPS 12 volt 2.9 to one of them is a 4 +
4 and the other one is a straight 8 pin
so you can run motherboards like the
EVGA SR 2 we've got industrial grade
protection 80 millimeter PWM fan don't
be afraid of the 80 millimeter fan antec
actually specifically calls out on the
other side of their box the way that
they have the profile set up for this
fan is such that up until you hit about
50 to 60 percent load it's gonna stay at
like pretty much negligible 500 to a
thousand rpm that is not going to be
audible and by the time you're ramping
up to the point where I mean remember
50% to 60% load on this power supply is
600 to 800 watt we're talking like major
major power draw so by the time you're
actually pulling a thousand watts of the
power supply and it starts to get
there's probably something out than your
rig that's making noise - it's rated for
continuous power like every single anti
power supply on the market not peak
power although I have seen I have
actually seen firsthand experiences with
this power supply at pulling eight are
providing 1,800 watts of power so never
mind continuous power 1200 watt it can
provide a lot more than that active
power factor correction okay we've got
Japanese branded capacitors we've got
the oh yeah EU P 2010 certification so
that's pretty cool - eight pin CPU I
already talked about that hybrid cable
management talked about that and DC to
DC architecture which is mostly
interesting to PSU geeks but what it
basically means is that the power for
the five volt and 3.3 volt rails
actually comes from the 12 volt rail
just being adaptive rather than having
dedicated circuitry for those it's it's
it is a good approach there's a reason
they put it on the side of the box so
let's see the power supply itself it
actually kind of reminds me of some of
their other high-end products so the
Antec logo is similar to the one you
find on like the 1200 gaming case all
right I don't know whether it's gonna be
visible in your case depending on how
you mount it yeah probably actually so
you'll either see it this way or if you
mount it the other way around in your
case you're gonna see all of those fancy
specs so actually I want the cameraman
to come have a look you can see all 12
volt rails are here they are all rated
at a maximum of 30 amps and a minimum of
0 amps you can see that the 12 volt
rails combined are capable of 1188 watts
or 99 amps and then they've actually
broken out the 5 volt 3.3 bull and the
other sort of less important rails into
a separate little chart here we've also
got the 80 plus gold certification here
as well as a couple different languages
for all the information that we find
alright let's move around to the side so
you can see an tech has severally made
it so that no matter how you mount this
power supply in your case whether it's
this way or oh no ok well it looks like
an tech really intends for you to mount
it this way because it's going to be
right side up for your sticker you're
gonna be able to see this and you're
gonna hide the sticker with all of the
little random infor
on it on the bottom so that's probably
going to be optimal here at the back we
find a okay so that's an 80 millimeter
sin
sanyo dinky fan sanyo dinky fans are
renowned for being the highest quality
especially when you're under bolting
they're not gonna get any ticking or
buzzing noises that are going to be
bothersome so I'd expect this power
supply to be very very quiet up until
the point where the fun really starts
ramping up we've got a power switch as
well as our power cable input here and
then around to the other side we've got
a grill at the front you can actually
kind of see inside I'm gonna try and get
you guys some more light to see in there
but this power supply uses a dual PCB
design so there's actually a PCB on the
top of the unit as well as a PCB on the
bottom of the unit that gives them a lot
more room to do soldering rather than
having one PCB at the bottom and it also
allows them to effectively lay out the
components internally so there's very
little air resistance for the 80ml fan
so an tech philosophy is that with an
efficient internal layout you don't need
to really pump the RPMs up on the fan in
order to draw a lot of airflow through
and cool the components you can actually
see clear through to thee to my fingers
on the other side can you see that to
the camera yeah you can so that's why
even though it's spinning at a low rpm
it's able to effectively move air
through the unit so let's have a look at
the pre-attached cables and then we will
go ahead and take a look at those
modular cables as well these are a bit
of a challenge for me but I'll figure it
out yeah there we go okay sorry
so the first bundle is going to have our
20+4 pin that is a 24-pin connector okay
you can see it's actually sleeved pretty
nicely okay an ant X leaving hasn't been
my favorite sometimes in the past but
because I mean especially on the Quattro
1200 they had those those capacitors
here so they had like kind of weird
lumps on all the cables so this is quite
a bit better alright next we've got the
eight pin as well as the four plus four
pin so that
they're dual 8-pin or single a plinth
pins plus for kids all right and then
we've got another bundle here so it has
quite a lot of pre attached cables and I
hear people criticizing that sometimes
however I'm going to give you guys a bit
of a different philosophy on what I
think of lots of pre-attached cables on
a 1200 watt power supply because I think
it's just fine because if you have a
1200 watt power supply and you're not
running at least a 24 pin a single 8 pin
and then oh man this is taking me
forever to remove I'm sorry guys and
then a couple of high end graphics cards
so for 6 plus 2 pins then you probably
don't need a 1200 watt power supply
because if you're not running 2 graphics
cards there's pretty much no
justification for it whatsoever
so in this other bundle we're gonna find
a 6 plus 2 pin another 6 plus 2 pin once
again these are fully sleeved even be in
between lengths ok and then we have
another 6 plus 2 pin as well as a 6 plus
2 pin I also want to take a second and
show you guys how ntek labels those 8
12-volt rails so you can see that the 12
volt rail is clearly labeled on the side
of the connector for these PCIe alright
so we've got actually up to 30 amps
according to the rated specification for
the power supply / graphics card because
every 6 + 2 pin harness okay each two
are actually on their own 12 volt rail
and that also goes for the modular
connectors which I'll show you in a
minute
so the other pre-attached cables once
again I don't mind this because it's
only three molex odds are you need at
least a couple molex for any kind of
build that you're doing and then three
SATA cables so after that we've got
modular cables and I'm gonna show you
actually something that I really like
about this power supply in just a moment
so the first one you got here we go so
you can see this one's actually not
labeled in terms of the 12 volt rail
oh yeah I can look look look even the 24
pin as well as the 8 pin and the 4 + 4
pin also have labels and each CPU
connector has its own 12 volt rail as
well alright
here we go so these are not labeled
however they are labeled on the power
supply themselves so 12 volt 7 12 volt 8
all right so those are where you're
going to be able to plug in up to an
additional 4 PCIe 6 + 2 pin connectors
so that is to say you can have 4 GTX 580
s running off of this power supply with
no sweat whatsoever
pretty crazy all right so here we go
we've got a connector here SATA here we
got SATA here all right let's have a
look at what we got included so let's
say you're doing a fairly modern build
you're not running a ton of molex
devices you have up to 3 more modular
connectors so you can plug in another
three of these SATA cables which each
have three so that is up to 12 SATA
devices so you can run you know a
blu-ray drive DVD drive and then like a
10 drive raid array or something
directly off the power supply with 0
adapters if you so desire if you don't
need so much SATA you've also got to
Molech modular cables so ntek is giving
you the option to install whatever it is
that you need one of them is 3 molex and
the other one is 3 wool X and one floppy
connector so if you actually still need
one of these yes they have provided one
on one of the modular cables now here's
a really cool thing let's say you've
only got two graphics cards but you need
all 12 SATA connectors and you need all
nine 9 molex connectors
well here's a neat one you can take
these ones out and then you can go ahead
and plug a molex one into here look at
that
BAM that's simple so that also gives you
the ability to run peripherals off
another 12 volt rail because the way the
power supply is set up by default okay
I'm gonna try and find you a molex yeah
okay these ones aren't labeled and these
aren't labeled but all of the peripheral
connectors so the ones that are pre
attached
theta and molex as well as all three of
the HDD labeled modular connectors are
running off 12 volt for now remember
that's 30 amps that's a lot for water
cooling pumps fans hard drives basic
stuff you'd have to have a lot of stuff
in order to trip that 30-amp OCP however
I actually recently did a build with 24
hard drives and I found when I initially
booted it up this was with a Quattro
1200 watt when I initially booted it up
I was getting an error in the system was
shutting down and what I was able to do
with that one was I had to adapt and use
a different twelve volt rail to power
some of the hard drives so if you are
powering like 24 hard drives and then
some other stuff sorry about that we
reached maximum video length which means
I better finish this up pretty quick so
I had to use an adapter with that one it
suffice to say I would have been able to
just take a cable and plug it into the
PCIe connector on this one and that
would have taken care of it for me by
putting some of the hard drives on a
separate 12 volt rail so that when they
all spin up at the same time and draw a
bunch of juice it doesn't trigger the
OSAP so thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the an Tek high current pro
1200 watt continuous power 80 plus gold
