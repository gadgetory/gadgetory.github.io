1550 wireless n router with speed boost
and probably the biggest feature of this
one considering that this is a more
value oriented router is the inclusion
of the USB storage store and share so
I'm going to go ahead and get the
packaging off here and model yeah whoa
it's okay everything's okay the
weather's fine comes with a power
adapter and it comes with a router and
the linksys e series set up see
something that's kind of cool that you
may or may not know about linksys
routers is that no matter which terror
product you're buying the very highest
end of the very lowest end is exactly
the same setup process very very simple
we did actually try the linksys setup
procedure with our range extender so
that was pretty easy okay we've also got
an Ethernet cable and I think slicks
laughing because I'm trying to hide by
cutting from the camera yes I'm bleeding
it's okay don't worry about it you know
this happens all the time it's like it's
you know it's a box cut right um
actually it's from my knife but yeah so
basically with all of my unboxings I
should probably be including like a
warning like don't try this at home
because you could end up with blood on
your finger okay so but seriously Bloods
not funny aids and stuff features and
specifications he wants me to change the
angle so I'm going to go ahead and sort
of adjust it here features and
specifications wireless-n built with
leading 80 2.11 n technology for top
performance and range broad
compatibility work seamlessly with
backwards compatible as well as n
devices 2.4 gigahertz band since it's
not a dual band router this is a fairly
basic router high speed up to 300
megabit per second so this is not quite
that basic because it's not wireless
n150 it is more like full wireless n
which is 300 megabit there are 450
megabit products but right now they
command a pretty serious premium over
the 300 megabit products extended range
oh look at that this has a mimo antenna
okay okay so this is actually a fairly
serious business router than speed boost
increases signal strength across greater
distances
good stuff advanced security that's
pretty much standard right there fast
ethernet ports so for ten hundred ports
this is mostly intended for a home where
you're predominantly using the wireless
and you're not relying too much on the
wired otherwise you're going to want to
step up to a gigabit router we've also
about the USB storage part so add
external storage and share files across
your network so this isn't for serious
file sharing because like I said this is
a ten hundred router so it's not like
you're gonna go and put like you know
ten terabytes of data onto this
sharePort here and expect to be you know
accessing it in a reasonable amount of
time you are going to want a higher-end
router for that no this is more for your
casual thing so you throw external hard
drive on there you put your photos or
you put you know a couple you know funny
videos or whatever that you want grandpa
to see when he comes over you pull them
out on your tablet or whatever you shift
through them that's the intended purpose
of something like this this is not like
to you know run nightly backups of all
your PC's and restore from it and do
like crazy massive amounts of data so
let's just have a close look at the
router because it looks pretty much like
most of the other linksys routers out
there right now we've got our four ten
hundred ports our lan port our reset
button our power LED as well as our
power input port we have a look at this
tampering with or disassembling this
device voids the warranty so please
don't open it up you shouldn't need to
open it up anyway it's got lots of
cooling anyway and I hold on a second
i'll be back slicks trying to sell to
say something slick says I failed to
mention the USB when I was pointing at
all the ports on the back I'm sure that
was worth interrupting the video for all
right we've got ventilation slots around
all edges of this router so there
shouldn't be pretty much any need to
open it up because it's got lots of
cooling either way and did I say this
was reset what I really meant was WPS
this is for one touch setup the reset
button is actually down here and then
we've got little rubberized grippy bits
here which are going to keep it from
sliding around when you put it down and
that's pretty much it this is the e 1550
wireless-n router with speed boost don't
