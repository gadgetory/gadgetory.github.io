more it's lightening time again folks
MSI has their regular cards then they
are gaming cards both of which are
pretty sweet but they're truly flagship
graphics cards are branded a lightning
presumably because they are so flashy
looking or wait no hold on probably
because they're powerful and lightning
is made of electricity and clouds wait
hold on just electricity how does even
so the first thing you're going to
notice about this graphics card is the
weight holy balls it comes in an awesome
carrying case style box with a full set
of accessories including PCI Express 6
pin 2 8 pin adapters and even an
alternate back plate for the card if you
just want its aside to swap out the
full-length one for just a smaller short
one once the box is open the next
obvious thing is the fact that this is
not a reference card I mean here there's
a picture of a reference card for
context in a smaller and puny ER in
every possible way because of this you
will need to make sure that your system
is capable of containing the greatness
of the gtx 780 lightning side panel fans
could interfere with its increased
height and you'll need to make sure that
you have enough expansion slots free
because due to its 2 plus slot cooler it
will take up 1 to 3 PCI slots now
because the card is based on the geforce
gtx 780 GPU there are no real surprises
in terms of normal nvidia graphics card
features you got support for sli 3d
vision physics cuda g-sync and of course
GeForce experience which has now added
game streaming to compatible devices
like Nvidia shield low overhead gameplay
recording and twitch live streaming to
its ability to optimize your game
settings and keep your graphics drivers
all up-to-date and all
good stuff but that's not why you were
shopping for a lightning let's talk
about what makes this card special first
up is the fact that this is a very non
reference PCB it utilizes components
with emphasized military class concept
including the arm loss for copper loss I
see cats new super ferrite chokes and
they're dark solid capacitors so unless
you've got some electrical engineering
under your belt most of that probably
sounded like gibberish but the point is
that even though the mill standard 810g
compliance doesn't really mean much
a lightning cart is capable of running
faster cooler and longer than a typical
reference card second is their triple
force architecture so the Lightning logo
on the top illuminates green blue or red
depending on the load their twin froze
or cooler design has been updated to a
tri frozer with three PWM controlled
propeller blade fans rather than two and
their power delivery system for the card
itself has been decked out with an all
digital design core memory and auxiliary
voltage are all digital next up is the
GPU reactor which is basically like an
extra PCB strapped to the back of the
card to reduce ripple and increase power
delivery to the GPU core in practice
this will be way beyond irrelevant
unless you're using exotic cooling
methods but hey it's there to go along
with it
there v checkpoints allow you to easily
monitor key card voltages if you're
performing mods and want to use a
dedicated multimedia rather than some
multimedia multimeter rather than
software to find out how much juice
you're giving to key components on the
card particularly when you're extreme
overclocking their twin vias feature
gives you two separate BIOS chips which
is good because if you can find your way
to get your hands on the non nerfed ln2
bios that allows a power limit over a
hundred and nine percent then that might
be pretty useful now to be clear guys we
benchmarked our card
assuming that end users will have to
just deal with the stock BIOS but trust
me there is more potential
this card if you're willing to get a
little bit crazy and that dual BIOS
implementation means that there's an
easy bailout switch if something goes
wrong during a BIOS flash triple over
voltage that is cranking up the volts to
the GPU memory and PLL is all handled
separately because of that feature and
it is fully supported by nano sized
afterburner software but again it will
have limited relevance unless you
perform the BIOS flash that I was
talking about a moment ago because that
is going to hold back the true raw
potential of this graphics card in a
very meaningful way so the conclusion is
this the GTX 780 lightning is how you
say lightning fast we threw a few games
at it from our usual suite of benchmarks
and while it doesn't really stand out
from the crowd in terms of its
performance just as a reminder guys all
of our cards are overclocked as high as
they can go in my opinion it's really
very reasonably priced for 50 dollars
more than a reference 780 running at
reference clocks and as little as 20 to
30 dollars more than a normal long
reference card if nothing else you're
getting better build quality and cooler
operation for your graphics cards
throughout its lifetime it's also
aggressively overclocked out of the box
at a full 133 megahertz faster max boost
clock then a reference GTX 780 and it
has no difficulty hitting those numbers
consistently while running cooler and
still being satisfyingly quiet my only
issue with the 780 Lightning actually
has nothing to do with MSI but rather to
do with Nvidia since it was released the
780 Lightning has been nerfed with that
109 percent power limit bios that I was
talking about before versus the
aggressive one that it had available to
it at launch this practice of Nvidia is
where non-approved card designs are
limited put some restraints on their
partners ability to deliver the best
possible performance and while I
understand invidious perspective and you
know I agree that maintaining a brand
image of reliability is more important
than three more fps in battlefield in
general I wish the the card partners and
end-users were allowed to make their own
choice and forgo warranty coverage if
they
really want to push things to the limit
I mean I guess the really extreme guys
still can if they go and find BIOS mods
but I just wish it was a little bit
easier anyway guys thanks for watching
this review of the msi geforce gtx 780
lightning don't forget to like this
video if you liked it dislike it if you
disliked it leave a comment and let me
know what you think would you spend an
extra twenty to fifty dollars knowing
that your card is going to run cooler
and it's going to look better and it's
going to last longer or is that not
worth it to you do you upgrade so often
that it doesn't really matter
