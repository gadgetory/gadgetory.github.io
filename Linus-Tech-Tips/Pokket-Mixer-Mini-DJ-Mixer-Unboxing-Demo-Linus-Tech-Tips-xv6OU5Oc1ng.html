the pocket mixer mini DJ mixer so I
don't know that this is something that
DJ's need because I'm not a DJ and I
don't really know anyone who's a DJ but
I'm sure you know someone who's a DJ or
at least attempts to be one so you guys
can tell me mini table blah blah blah
for signal something-something
installations sampler okay I think
that's some other language music in
music in headphones out and stereo sort
of out there so let's open this baby up
no batteries needed apparently which is
sort of cool pocket mixer so there's
like a bear or something which is
obviously related to DJ okay we've got
some included cables here couple little
guys just like that also got a nice
little velvet bag that it's included
with it okay we've got some sort of cool
stuff here so this explains what
everything is so there's your highs mids
and lows here's your master right left
on/off okay
alright music in music in music okay so
that's just the same diagram we saw
before instructions with the same
diagram Oh different language this time
good stuff alright I am actually sort of
interested to try this oh there we go
so you can decide if you want to listen
to right or left there's your master
volume so we're going to put everything
at the middle for now cause everything
is cranked at the moment and here we go
okay oh yeah okay you can actually wow
you can adjust it for what kind of
impedance your your headphones are so
that's sort of neat so you can just kind
of change that that dial
there's your inputs there's your output
so that goes out to the stereo or
whatever else and then there's your
headphones for monitoring and this is
your headphone monitoring volume and
then this is your left and right slider
for the various tracks that you have
going on so what's up let's try this so
this thing works actually check this out
so we've got it set up
and basically how it works is I've got
my monitors here and then I can select
which one I want to listen to so here
I'll get right down here so you guys can
see what's going on so I can select if I
want to listen to the right or the left
ear so check this out guys um let me see
if I can okay here here here so I'll put
this right next to the microphone and
see if you can like hear that can you
hear that at all I'm listening to the
other track okay whatever while I am so
or I can listen to the track that you
guys are hearing then what I can do is I
can actually mix the songs together so
now you can hear my All American Rejects
and whatever this nonsense that slick
listens to is then I can switch it over
so now I'm still listening to Slick's
music in my ear which is devastating so
I'm just going to do that so now I can
listen to the same thing that I'm
listening to over here you can also make
adjustments on the high mid and low so
if I decided that
Slick's music needed less mid less high
and more bass then I could switch back
to it like that and we could I don't
know turn it up or something
oh this is so awful how do you listen to
this
there we go so you check it out
so yeah you can play around with all the
dials and do whatever it is that people
who know about these things do with
these things I think it's pretty
self-explanatory so you can adjust your
overall master volume although there
might be something going on with our
unit here where it's uh doesn't really
like the master volume adjust too much
but all of these are working a hundred
percent you can switch back to so yeah
basically the idea is you have a couple
iPods and you monitor your music and you
Oh check it out there's the headphone
volume so I can turn up my monitoring
volume so there you go so here so you
guys should be able to hear that even
once I switch over there can you hear it
stuff okay well whatever you guys get
the point so I think that's pretty much
it it's pretty self-explanatory
it's unpowered which is cool so what
that means is that you actually don't
have to have it plugged into anything
you can literally carry it around in
your pocket and oh oh it's the speaker's
causing the issue so it wasn't even this
so I don't know what's wrong with those
speakers but let's don't worry about it
too much right now
so the point is you can carry this
around with you in your pocket wherever
you go and because it's it's not powered
so it's not amped that means you do have
to hook it up to an amped speaker setup
or you know receiver or stereo or
whatever else so it just takes too
passive inputs mixes them together I
just sort of your your the
characteristics of the noise I forget
what it's called fader to notice for
cars that's like front and back whatever
don't worry about it um you can turn the
EQ oh yeah equalizer here we go ah you
can turn the EQ on and off you can
adjust your master volume you can select
what you're monitoring you can mix this
is actually very smooth and very easy to
use you can adjust your headphone volume
you can plug in your headphones here and
finally you can adjust the impedance of
the headphones you're using according to
what you're using to monitor so very
cool little tool and I mean tons of
applications beyond just sort of
deejaying or whatever else I mean you
could even use it for things like if you
had a couple of people that you know
we're miked up for something then you
could switch between them or you know
have just sort of one source that goes
to maybe one receiver pack something
like that so you could actually use to
mic someone that's what I'm planning to
use it for but sky's the limit
