by D brand maker of high quality vinyl
skins for your devices check them out at
the link in the video description
alright so we're here in the NSI booth
where somebody named Leon si has finally
built the computer that I've been asking
to be built for like four years four
years I've been asking for someone to
make a chassis that is legitimately
about the size of the PlayStation 4 with
exactly the compromises that I asked for
now mind you it did take a little while
for the technology to catch up because
back when I was asking for that we
didn't necessarily have MDOT to SSDs in
the mainstream so you know they do have
the advantage of the ever ever-changing
tech industry but this is it this is the
Trident 3 what they're calling the
world's smallest VR ready gaming pc
iguess MSI's desktop division never got
the memo from the notebook to division
that they actually have a lot of smaller
notebooks that are also be are certified
but I see what I see their point they
mean desktop PC so that's fine so what
do you get with this puppy aside from a
form factor there's actually pretty darn
similar to the PlayStation 4
you also get flexibility because we've
seen stuff like this from indie makers
like the century case where it was like
yeah we have this super slim chassis it
was actually taller and you couldn't put
it on its side without compromising
cooling this one has rubber feet on the
bottom so you can pick any orientation
you want it has a full spec i/o so
you've got headphone microphone type-c
USB regular USB and an HDMI port if
you're one of those people who has a VR
headset you want to be able to plug it
in from the front because you unplug it
for some reason instead of just having
the cable anchored and having it running
around to the back of your computer
maybe you move it around a lot I don't
know how you do that because the
lighthouse is kind of screw into your
roof I don't know I'm not too worried
about why it is exactly that we need
that on the front but you also get this
this is exactly the layout that I've
been asking for fans on one side no
internal power supply so they're using a
single external brick and does that come
at a bit of a cost maybe but your
still getting a very good gaming
experience so you can get up to an Intel
Core i7 7700 you can get up to 32 gigs
of DDR 4 dual channel memory you get an
MDOT 2 on the back and a two and a half
inch SSD kind of behind the video card
there and you can fit I mean I've been
I've been asking for this chassis ever
since the 970 mini from Asus was
launched ok so you're able to fit one of
these little mini what are these 8
inches long something along those lines
the mini cards that go up to a gtx 1070
which is an incredible amount of gaming
power in a very small form-factor now
this one is only shipping at this time
with up to a core i7 and a gtx 1060 but
they've told me that sometime in March
we can expect a 1070 model to come it
looks freaking awesome I can't wait to
review it and it actually based on my
experience here at the show so far is
pretty darn quiet - so thanks for
