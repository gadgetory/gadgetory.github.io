then we're going to water coolant we're
going to have a full budget of $500 $300
for our computer and a maximum of $200
for the water cooling parts but there's
a twist we cannot use any off-the-shelf
PC water cooling gear nada
yeah scrapyard Wars scrapyard Wars - and
thus gravity yell over to Terran to tell
Brandon that I need him to get the
camera ready so we can go and that never
happened
Brandon was never told we're leaving now
it's about 12:30 yeah so we're late okay
so my first hit for aluminum block
Vancouver is from Hardware Canucks
one of the first good old sugar J one of
the first recommendations is metal Mart
so Vancouver in the suburb of Langley
yeah boy we're practically sitting on
one of their locations okay awesome
all right so here's what we're trying to
do we want to make a cooling block for a
computer component tippity booth there
we go
can you give me some idea of what we'd
be looking at for like a block of
aluminum maybe a yay thick maybe gay big
yeah like what what does that cost
is that the like cheapo scrap bin but
there's things like that yeah that
that's the one I actually saw right when
I walked in and I thought that looks
pretty appealing I need it today and
this is thick enough yeah so um so like
do you just sell it by the length or so
yeah so how much does it cost
I wasn't even able to pick that stupid
deal and is there a particular grade or
like Alloway that it is yeah 6061 uh-huh
I meant nothing to me
it's a this machinable
it's a like a structural aluminum okay
okay
pretty decent quality what a sales pitch
I like this guy
you know shops like this existent just
like here's a ginormous metal rod five
inches with 661 f2 times six dollars and
61 cents Wow but not bad okay um and
then you guys have a charge for four
cuts right first cut on that is free
every cut after the dollars okay um hey
that's very reasonable
okay can I can I have a couple minutes
with a napkin and a pen and kind of
figure out what exactly I need fantastic
thank you okay so CPU block there's a
couple different ways we can go about
this we could go really small like the
older Nexus alpha cool blocks that were
only about yay big but what I worry
about is we would
the camera why this is here they're here
I'm just gonna hide this diagram what's
in there
nothing what's that see you later what
is it I I show me this isn't awkward at
all
I wonder what we're both doing oh I
guess we're gonna we're gonna we're
gonna get what we're getting and then
get out of here cuz if you give us five
minutes we're pretty much allowed to
stay in the store pretty much that all
right we'll be we'll be back we'll be
back later then cuz I can't give away
too much of my plan
you're leaving too
oh oh I see I see alright alright I'll
see ya
well he's found a source for metal you
know this much so I saw online that you
guys could do fabrication not this
occasion for tales okay that's fine if I
asked that if I showed them this could
they make me a plate with a little pot
on it
what kind of POD it's I was looking for
a copper plate with holes through it so
I could go through there and then just
any form of dome pot that would go over
top of the CPU yep ask them yeah okay
sounds like they could do yeah up there
so so port kills can you give me the
address Rangers I think we just saw
Brandon and Luke on the road but it
couldn't be you know uh no we're not
gonna chase them I think they're heading
to Home Depot though that's okay we've
already been hearing people
oh alright so they're making progress
then oh ballsack this might be one of
the ones I really liked all but I can't
get it till after 5:00 which one is this
never been overclocked of levity blue
150 you know what you know what this
isn't sauce in a Sonata three case um
it's it's by the time you put a graphics
card in it oh we could afford a better
graphics card though than the one we're
about to ghost we're just gonna go see
it yeah we're gonna go we're gonna go
see it and you know what though barring
anything unforeseen I'm just gonna grab
it I think
oh we're getting pulled over so I know
you're not you're clutching your boat
what you can't do what you drive yes sir
SuperDuper don't know here for a
Craigslist computer pickup so this is it
you say this is an ex 58 based system I
did not see that one came this is what
we're going to be dealing with this card
shouldn't be a problem
although it's a really good thing that
we didn't go and pick out a chunk of
aluminum for our CPU cooler based on an
LGA 775 socket size because this is
using LGA 1366 does I have a front fan
in it or not it does not we are not
going to have a lot of airflow so I'm
gonna have to get really creative about
how I Jam all of this in there to even
have any chance of cooling this thing
okay well there you go that's that's
pretty much all of our PC budget right
there the rest we have is cooling budget
I want to count it yep that is one
rancid front filter wha-ha-ha ready I'm
gonna do it don't be downwind stupid
that way ah oh it's going back to the
computer no get away from my card oh
that's a feather there's a feather yeah
yeah if I just got a small amount of
metal from you guys in a sheet that I
could put on could I just essentially
epoxy a cap on there would that be fine
the cost of fabrication is high although
that totally makes sense that's what
they do here so getting it welded is
probably not an option right now that
would be super cool if I was doing this
on my own and had more than a 200 dollar
budget but I don't so I'm going to call
back to jb weld station so this probably
sounds terrible because it looks like
they're cutting my sheet probably right
there actually so I'm getting a copper
sheet little blocks of copper it's super
cheap just to cut it so that's pretty
nice and then I'm gonna have to kind of
cut it to size my own drill the holes
myself and then I'm going to hopefully
find a copper or aluminum cap of some
sort at a Home Depot or something so I
just got in total the copper plate for
about 6 bucks only because he had to
sell it to me at a minimum quantity rush
I didn't know that until he was telling
me out so I probably should just got
more just in case but I didn't so well
I'll figure it out I need more it's not
that big a deal it wasn't that expensive
and I'm sure if I go back there I can be
like here's the invoice you charged me
for half a pound only got like 0.125 of
a pound can you just give me some more
and it might be fine the
the cap cost about two dollars and
seventy five cents copper cap it's gross
I'm gonna have to clean that up but
that's no problem I'm not worried about
reservoir I'm going to pretty much
ignore reservoir as of right now because
I can just do the fallback of like going
to Safeway and buying a $1 2-liter
bottle of Pop just like pouring the pop
out cleaning it up and then using that
as a reservoir but pump and Radiator is
going to be a pretty serious problem
radiators going to be expensive and
large so there's the idea of just buying
a car radiator and there's also the idea
of doing the copper coil thing but I'd
kind of rather not but I'm going to buy
a copper coil right now so I can cut it
up and use parts of it so I guess we'll
see what happens from that so I got my
copper tubing that I was looking for
this should be small enough to fit into
that cap that I was talking about and
it's actually fairly flexible so I got a
fair amount of it because it's not too
expensive
and I'm going to try to just use it as
all my tubing because that would
actually be kind of nice because if I
can just jb weld this into my blocks and
whatnot then I can save money on
fittings which would be pretty sick but
kind of funny so well while I was in
there I wanted to ask if Brandon could
come in and film and there was no one
for me to ask I couldn't find any
employees anywhere which is fine it's a
more of a self-serve store and we're in
a princess auto by the way so I get up
to the teller and I go to buy my whole
big roll of copper tubing and she's like
oh did you get it cut I'm like oh no I
just wanted to get all of it and she's
like oh you should get a cut so I go
back to get it cut some guys trying to
steal a whole bunch of stuff in the
store he has his pockets completely full
with like products literally coming out
of it now like you have to pay for that
you have to pay for that so he freaks
out and just starts throwing products
down the aisles while leaving the store
and just Hux everything all over the
place and then gets pissed off and
leaves the store and then I get my thing
cut and there's like a billion employees
and I could have easily asked for
Brendan to come in and film but I was
finally done so let's go
50 bucks so what I saved on my radiator
I may have actually just had to spend on
coolant but I have my pump I have my
coolant I have my reservoir I have my
rad and we're going to go pick up the
raw materials for our blocks now I just
want to do a quick sanity check to make
sure that my pump fits inside my
reservoir before we leave here oh that's
really close
oh that's quite restrictive at the inlet
isn't it oh not too bad actually hey
hold on hold on just a gosh-darn moment
here it's really are the world's worst
suction cups though I might get away
with that this thing isn't gonna seal
anymore that's for darn sure I guess I
didn't really think of that hmm okay so
we're back at metal Mart let's go ahead
and have a close look at exactly what we
need for metal for our blocks that's
fine go get the door for me or anything
just hold that camera will you ask me
loose get it back you got it you got a
paper I I have a very I have a very
fixed budget that's part of the
competition you wanted some ah I know
what either well plate analyze both and
I know what he wants that's okay oh I
have a better plan than him anyway Pro
trolls man Pro Tools it all day looks
like madness is I wish I had my calipers
he's got two counters you're the man man
so Center to Center and then zero that
bad boy again
ah I do sliced my hand Wow that's
surprisingly deep for not drawing blood
oh there's a little bit yeah these are
sharp by the way in case anyone's right
here's our order you need eight pieces
we need I'm basically just buying two of
each to give us a buffer to screw up
okay so our medals costing us 38 37 I
have I asked for a lot more cuts than I
had gotten my original quote on so this
is definitely more than I had
necessarily wanted to spend on it but I
think 40 bucks for two water blocks I
can find a way to live with so that
means we have left in our budget for
fittings any miscellaneous stuff we've
got eighty-five dollars not bad not bad
I think we're still I think we're still
think we're still okay so here let's
have a look at the goods here so these
two are going to be those that's going
to be that heat sink for the GPU vrm
these bad boys here are going to be my
tops for my CPU blocks which are here
and then our GPU blocks this is heavy
though we're going to have to take a lot
of material out of this just for weight
so we've got two of those as well
so we have two of everything so that we
don't have to leave the the CNC tomorrow
Oh what's the $2 a change okay awesome
thank you very much my good sir and I
really hope this works I have no backup
plan
next time on scrapyard wars the mayor of
Quahog does the outro - climbs a 40-foot
tree no really he actually climbs a tree
so stay tuned alright that's it no more
it's gonna get dumber and dumber my IQs
gonna go down with</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
