member of Western Digital Live series of
products so live as far as I can tell
has to do with networking so this is a
home network drive that is a mass and
this particular one is a one terabyte
drive so that means up to a hundred and
twenty HD videos and there's some kind
of Asterix there 250 a thousand mp3s or
200 thousand photos Gigabit Ethernet
connects to your home network and this
is the cool thing about this guy look at
that up to 100 megabytes per second
performance now there's all kinds of
mainstream NASA's available on the
market these days
but the reality of it is in my
experience testing them it can be
gigabit or 10 100 or 10 gigabit I don't
care what connectivity they have on the
back the processor inside the NASA
enclosure just isn't fast enough to
deliver the kind of thorough put that
the hard drive inside is capable of so
what Western Digital is done with this
product is they've taken the bottleneck
out of the processor inside the box and
they're giving you almost the full
performance of that drive over your
network so that means that when you're
pulling files off of this drive we don't
think to see this because we're gonna
open the box when you're fooling pulling
files off of this drive it's gonna
perform almost the same as an internal
drive in your system pretty cool huh
so you can centralize all of your
storage that goes for pretty much any
NAS it comes with Western Digital
software to backup your computers
including Apple Time Machine
compatibility you can access your files
anywhere including viewing stored photos
with your iPhone iPad or iPod touch and
you can also stream media throughout
your home including to the WD TV live
and I'll actually be doing a video
shortly about that particular topic on
my NCIX
tech tips channel it's compatible with
pretty much everything under the Sun XP
vista windows 7 OS leopard and Snow
Leopard it has some contents inside and
this is cool I you know what I know
everyone but me has probably seen this
already but I just got a smartphone so
I'm gonna go ahead and
this out so hold on give me a minute
here we go so I'm gonna go ahead and
look at that there we go
turns green and then it pulls up a web
page and I can read all about the my
book lied so cool so uh yeah I think
that's a neat feature that the box comes
with the QR code on it like I said I
just got a smartphone go easy on me
you know I'm behind in the times see all
the stuff it comes with this little guy
all right let's look at the accessories
first we got a pretty pretty cool
looking gigabit ethernet cable with like
shiny rims on the side it's looks like a
nice high-quality cable then we have a
power adapter so this particular power
adapter is 0.5 amps max at 12 volts so
you can go ahead and assume this guy's
not gonna pull a whole lot of power from
your wall here's the software CD which
is gonna walk you through all the
configuration steps has the WD smart
we're for windows free remote access
service setup wizard don't throw this
away unless you download the latest off
the WD site which I'm not sure if they
have and I believe that CD even prompts
you to download the latest forms
although I could be wrong about that
here's your Quick Start Guide which is
fairly straightforward plug-in put in CD
follow the steps yeah that easy all
right
next we have technical support and
limited warranty guide that's all black
and white text Perry boy it's not gonna
look too closely at that and then
finally we got the my book live itself
so inside is a one terabyte hard drive
and outside is a pretty slick-looking
little enclosure so we have an activity
led right here very very small but that
ensures that it's not going to be
intrusive we have a nice little shiny WD
logo right there on the bottom we have
some non slippy rubber feet and we also
have if I can get the right angle and
get you guys to be able to see here we
have ventilation holes so you can
actually see right through there this
whole unit is simply cooled by
convection so it means that the warm
heart
inside and that is warm it doesn't get
hot because of all the airflow going
through it the warm hard drive inside
heats up the air around it
which causes the warm air naturally to
rise out the top where we also have
ventilation holes and then it's going to
pull in new fresh air from the bottom
where you can see we've actually got a
gap under the drive when the rubber feet
are on the table so that's where the air
flow is going to come from very simple
but very very effective on the back we
have a Kensington lock just in case you
have this on display in a store for
example and you don't want somebody to
steal it we have DC power in as well as
our Gigabit Ethernet connectivity you've
got a hard reset switch here as well as
a label of my book live now if I can
figure this out I'd love to be able to
show you guys how to I think there's a
way to actually open it I can't remember
how anyway that was my unboxing and
first look at the WD my book live I have
already actually done some testing on
this drive and it is fast that's why I
was so excited about this I have more
than one so I unboxed one on my own
before I unboxed one with all of you
