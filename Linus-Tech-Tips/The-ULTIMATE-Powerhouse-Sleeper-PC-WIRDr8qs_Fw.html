was to build the most powerful compact
desktop rig that we could but this time
our objective is a little different this
video is brought to you by sea sonic and
the rig's going to be powered by their
prime platinum 1300 watt and it is gonna
have everything you see here everything
you see here and everything you see back
there yeah most of that really didn't
work out but sleeper number 3 Margaret
well she's a taskmaster she is the
biggest baddest hardest sleeper PC that
we've ever built and did I mention that
she's beautiful
floppy bigger floppy jazz floppy DVD
rewriter dvd-rom like what is this is
this a zip zip disk or is it just a
cooling fan like what the hell is this
um hard drive hot swappable card reader
Windows 2000 professional ones two CPU
this is going to be a lot of work yeah
you know makes it a lot harder the
chiller the chiller and the carbon fiber
tubing that's why are we doing carbon
fiber tubing are you nuts
the first thing we needed to do was
figure out if our water chiller would
even fit inside the case we salvaged
from our friends at freakin Vancouver
like sure the case is massive but
there's still plenty of room for error
in something like this we disassembled
the chiller to find out what was inside
and then removed all the PC components
in our case to make space this is a
situation yeah it turns out that
eyeballing things is not quite a
substitute for measuring them can all
fit we can get it in but we might ruin
the condenser oh yeah that's gonna be a
super bad time
or you could just be like hey Kapow I'm
sorry this project won't be as
advertised I think that is exactly what
we're gonna do we're gonna go over kill
water cooling with the carbon fiber
tubing is that not cool enough yeah are
you not entertained and then we're gonna
have to I mean I still want to revisit
this yeah I think it's just a matter of
finding the right chassis if we find an
old server chassis or something
there is no reason we couldn't do that I
think it the best way is to just start
by building a computer in here that's
air cooled and then locating everything
where we think it'll work are you pumped
Oh
oh those get sponsored all these for
this build we're looking to have not
just insane gaming power but also crazy
workstation power with that in mind our
CPU selection was easy the thread Ripper
2990 X is a 32 core 64 thread beast and
it gives up some gaming performance but
it uh Turley embarrasses even intel's
top-end h EDT chip in multi-threaded
workloads for the GPU we're going with
NVIDIA GeForce RT X xx atti
I'd like to say that there's a good
reason for it but it's just the best GPU
for gaming will it be enough I I think
so I guess that we could have gone for
two but I don't know I wasn't really in
the mood
given what we've been hearing about
these it's extra important that we make
sure that everything is working before
we bought our water cooling it power is
being taken care of by C Sonic prime
platinum 1300 watt which admittedly is a
bit overkill for this system but on the
plus side it's going to operate in
silent mode basically the entire time
and like come on
if see Sonic offers you a 1300 watt
power supply for the project they're
sponsoring you take it so for this build
I'm going to be using a dim dot -
there's no real reason to use it besides
just I've had drives fail when they're
down below there before and water
cooling built and man at the horrible
part with everything installed it was
time to make sure that all our
components were in working order it was
pretty easy doesn't do that yeah hey
zero detect memory oh dang
it's just a tiny bit of thermal paste I
wonder if that's what was causing our
issues okay so the the motherboard that
we had before it's just dead so that's
why we're having so many issues and it's
like it's like a week and a half since
I've been working on this because it's
bad things were happening but hopefully
we're gonna get back here and in the
next day or so this will be a fully
functioning PC but I guess we'll find
out in the future
all right good bye
alright new Zenith extreme this one does
not have any bent pins so with any luck
it will work just fine Oh Co Tady detect
memory this is very bad Denis our CPU
might be dead we're gonna have to go
with something else here all right so
she's working now I talked to it nicely
like I haven't recommended an you just
called it an it okay it's not that it's
a she Thank You Margaret I'm sorry baby
okay so we need to put a water tool and
lube in here here's what I think why
don't you use a vertical adapter bracket
for the card and have the card vertical
that will give you space in behind here
to put the pump and the tubing to go up
with the loop planned out the components
were removed and it was time to drill
out the rivets to make space for our
water cooling
and the idea is that this right here
will be the new the new power supply
holder and also will allow for us to
have cable management in the back this
if it works will be made out of aluminum
on the CNC router but we will see in a
couple second that it's gonna be a good
time do you have any guesses three out
of five a good one now given that this
is our first time cutting aluminum on
our CNC one hand will be on the
emergency stop the whole time our first
piece didn't turn out perfectly but it
gave us all of the critical dimensions
that we needed and let us try out the
new vise break we got from princess Otto
for like 60 bucks
in theory this should bend our aluminum
to a nice clean 90 degrees and give
Margaret a really solid chassis snug
hood is easy as a massive break there
just seems to be working
well it did market up a bit but given
that that thing was like 60 bucks really
complained the prototype here is a solid
proof of concept now there's just a bit
of fine-tuning and then we're good to
make a final version really 60 bucks for
our break that managed those those bends
dang
this is problem hour with Alex so you're
about to watch a couple CNC router fails
and there are a lot more off camera we
tried a bunch of different things going
faster going slower new bits and it
turns out it was just a double-sided
tape that we got it was not up for the
task so we're going to be switching to
the most accurate tool of all the angle
grinder we'll need to make room for the
radiator reservoir and cable management
this will function just fine but gives
up a lot of rigidity compared to the
much thicker piece that we were going to
see and see next the front of the case
got chopped up to give the radiator more
airflow and everything was filed down so
that no hands would be cut while working
in Margaret with some radiator mounting
holes added it was time to put the case
back together riveting is a very simple
way to get two pieces of sheet metal to
stay together in a mostly permanent
fashion right select the correct sized
head for the rivet you're working with
insert the rivet from the front line up
the pieces you're about to rivet and
squeeze your rivet gun until it pops
repeat until your case is complete now
it's time for some painting then we can
finally get on to water cooling alright
so the first coat of paint on there and
what I'm hoping we will do today is get
everything pretty much mounted and water
cool then we'll take it all out put a
second coat of paint on now that we know
that everything's in the right spot and
tomorrow we'll be done for the water
cooling hardware alpha cool hooked us up
with some primo stuff to make sure that
Margaret can shred or rip all the
threads that we throw at her for our CPU
we're using an ice block with a thread
Ripper adapter then our r-tx 28 ET I got
an acetal water block for that sexy
stealthy all bull
and chromed look we swapped out the
connection point to make vertical
mounting easier so far so good but with
the CPU and GPU in we realized that
things didn't quite line up this is
gonna be really friggin difficult
starting to look kind of sexy though
we turned on my computer's data now the
key to getting a hard line water cooling
loop to work its best is to have as many
things line up perfectly as possible
this will make your runs a lot easier to
complete with fewer fittings that means
fewer points of failure now normally
even for hard line bending the tubing is
an option not with carbon fiber with
that all in mind we created a bracket
then to mount our pump with some room
for adjustments after the fact there's
just lots of mounting so everything is
straight yeah no this is great well this
isn't straight this isn't straight you
think I mean this can probably come yeah
yeah cool yeah I think it's gonna look
really cool we're not using this power
cables are we no that's just a stand-in
ours are in the mail cool so for the
tubing on this build we're going with
carbon fiber it's gonna be a real big
pain in the butt so carbon fiber if you
like get the little bits that come off
of it on you it'll make you all itchy if
you get it in your mouth it's a really
bad time if it goes into the air also
like together than your mouth with your
eyes really bad PPE aside carbon fiber
tubing is pretty much like any other
hard line tubing basically measure
measure again cut sand and insert with
that completed it was time to leak test
I don't have a whole lot of confidence
that this will not leak but
well well there's our first leak and
their second leak and our third leak so
we're having a couple of problems there
the main one being that there are two
o-rings in a fitting we are only getting
through the first one the second one the
carbon fibers stab it to shark even
after being sanded so either just hit it
or when it went through it would just
slice the o-ring to pieces and it
wouldn't seal at all so to combat that
we had to replace every single inner
ring and lubricate it well for a nice
clean insertion with the computer leak
free it was time to take everything
we've done completely undo it take the
whole thing apart and then put
everything back in permanently now one
of the biggest problems with this design
is that there are a lot of things about
our build that simply cannot be accessed
once it's complete without disassembling
the entire water cooling loop so it's
important that we not forget anything at
this stage like this laser cut acrylic
cable hiding panel it's gonna look
really nice but once that's in those
cables cannot come out other cosmetic
things were done at this stage - like
the drive bays which were unscrewed then
it pops it into the front of the case to
complete our vintage look now with
everything slapped in and the loop
topped off all that's left is the moment
of truth 90 to post error so just so I'm
clear what you've been doing for the
last two days is reseeding the CPU yeah
it didn't boo and then everything that's
here had to come out oh I had the CPU I
just took it out put it back in
everything worked and also like we
thought that it was other hues at first
but hey the CPU is at 22 degrees now yep
and it's cabled also why you can really
feel that airflow over the vents down
here they are they are quite small for
all the trials and tribulations that
have come along with this I think this
may be your finest sleeper yet
but Margaret isn't just a pretty face
she's a powerhouse that can compute
circles around her sleeper siblings in
certain workloads with zero tweaking she
got a Cinebench score of five thousand
and one and under full synthetic load on
all 32 cores even with the sub optimal
ventilation from the front our CPU
reached a maximum temperature of 48
degrees after some tweaking we've got a
four point one gigahertz overclock on
all 32 cores having us 6,000 points and
Cinebench and a blender BMW test time of
just one minute 22 seconds to put that
in context that is over four and a half
times faster than a core i9 MacBook Pro
and then even with the overclock in
longer tests Margaret still didn't get
any higher than 75 degrees on the CPU
and as for gaming well
Margaret's r-tx 20 atti means that she
can absolutely destroy games like you
could fully expect to max out any triple
a game at 1440p on a 144 Hertz monitor
so that's it
big thanks to Alex for sticking with
this project it was an absolute
nightmare because of some of the issues
with well how large thread Ripper is and
how you can kind of get inconsistent
notes in the socket sometimes and the
big things to see sonic first sponsoring
our efforts here even if you don't need
the 13 hundred watt beast of the unit
that we put in our system you can be
confident if you to see sonic that your
power supply will last I tried to think
of a bunch of other stuff to say about
power supplies but like isn't that the
bottom line and they've got a 12 year
warranty to back it up
