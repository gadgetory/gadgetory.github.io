entirely different beast depending on
how it happens to be implemented and
this comes down to power and thermal
constraints placed upon it in this video
we're going to give a little bit of a
deeper look into MSI's implementation on
their GT 72s 6qf Dominator pro G not
only in normal operating mode plugged
into the wall but also overclocked
plugged into the wall and stock but on
battery
freshbooks is the super simple invoicing
solution that lets you get organized
save time and get paid faster click now
to try for free
first off let's take a look at its
overall physical features this probably
out of your budget level expensive
machine features an SD card reader for
3.5 millimeter audio jacks and four USB
3.0 ports on the left-hand side on the
back there's a killer e 20 400 Ethernet
jack one power in one USB 3.1 type C
Super port and one mini DisplayPort on
the right-hand side you have your last
two USB 3.0 ports and a blu-ray writer
on the top of this unit that it has a
chiclet based keyboard with zoned
lighting controls there's also some
buttons for power on and off a graphic
switch between the eye GPU and discrete
GPU for power saving reasons or
performance reasons a cooler boost
button which massively ramps up your fan
speed a dedicated xsplit gamecaster or
user-defined application button and a
dedicated button to launch the
SteelSeries engine for keyboard lighting
and macro control it also features a
pretty nice touchpad with dedicated
buttons which I actually do prefer on
something like a gaming laptop but one
thing that I don't like well it's good
aesthetically is that they outlined the
touchpad with an LED but for physical
reasons I'm not going to be looking down
at my touchpad so it's not actually
going to really going to help me and I'd
like to be able to know where the edge
of the touchpad is for a screen it
features a 17.3 inch anti-glare wide
view 1080p screen which doesn't feature
g-sync I thought all MSI Dominator Pro
G's laptops featured g-sync hence the
whole pro G thing but I can't find it
anywhere in the video control panel or
on the box or in the laptop itself
physically on a sticker so I don't know
we're waiting comment from MSI moving on
to the internals there's an i7 69 20 HQ
processor running at 3.8 gigahertz with
turbo boost engaged 32 gigs of DDR for
memory 2 PCI Express based nvme SSDs in
raid 0 totaling 512 gigs and a single
7200 rpm one terabyte hard drive
Bluetooth version 4.1 killer n 1535
combo 2 by 2 AC
wireless and finally the piece de
resistance the full desktop grade gtx
980 so that's a lot of hardware and a
lot of money let's see how it performs
we tested our laptop in three different
scenarios running on AC power running on
AC power but overclocked and running on
battery power at stock we use the 500
megahertz overclock on our CPUs and a
100 megahertz overclock on our GPUs
which were both stable even without
giving the chips any extra voltage our
goal was not only to get an idea of the
msi gt72 s performance but also come to
contrast the different approaches that
MSI and Sager took with their respective
desktop gtx 980 s we recently reviewed
the Sager NP 98 70 u2g which features
not only a desktop gtx 980 but a desktop
intel skylake i7 6700 K as opposed to
the laptop specific sky like we have in
our MSI notebook meaning these two units
will have to approach power management
quite differently with that in mind
let's start off by looking at power draw
and thermals in our Crysis 3 skybox load
test not surprisingly the msi drew 47
want slower than the Sager with the
latter essentially trying to cram an
entire desktop rig into a laptop chassis
the MSI though ran hotter under load
with the GPU getting up to 83 degrees
Celsius and the CPU getting up to 78
degrees at stock speed and 87 when
overclocked but to be fair to MSI the
Sager has a much louder and more
aggressive default cooling profile the
after mentioned cooler boost button on
the MSI really cranks up the fans and
would undoubtedly result in lower
temperatures in any event though the msi
ran quite a bit cooler on battery thanks
to throttling to save power we also saw
a difference in GPU boost with the MSI
GTX 980 ending up twenty six megahertz
lower than the Sager at stock the MSI
CPU also didn't overclock as well as
applying a 100 megahertz offset only
resulted in an actual clock speed
increase of 65 megahertz but where the
MSI really struggled was when we
unplugged it and ran the low test on
battery power
here the GTX 980 maxed out at only 256
megahertz way lower than the stagers 734
here we can see the differences in
design philosophy between the two models
while segre designed theirs to be a true
replacement for your high-end desktop
rig and the size seems to be more
focused on building the 980 into a more
traditional conservative mobile platform
which was ultimate being lighter smaller
and quieter but not as great in the
performance Department with that said
you'd probably think that the MSI would
give us more longevity due to a lower
power processor and more aggressive
throttling on the GPU but sadly this was
not the case our benchmarks added up to
roughly 16 minutes of gameplay time
which drained both the MSI and the Sager
by a whopping 39% each meaning you'll be
hard-pressed to get an hour of gameplay
time out of either model however the MSI
was only able to manage 25 fps in Crysis
332 in Tomb Raider and 35 in battlefront
with the settings cranked up at 1080p
when you consider that the say Curitiba
rates of 45 65 and 67 respectively for
the same percentage of battery drain
however the experience was much more
positive when we plugged it in where it
managed frame rates that took full
advantage of the screen 75 Hertz refresh
rate and we're only slightly lower than
the sagres possibly due to MSI's
notebook class CPU overclocking our CPU
and GPU gave us a nice little bump of 4
