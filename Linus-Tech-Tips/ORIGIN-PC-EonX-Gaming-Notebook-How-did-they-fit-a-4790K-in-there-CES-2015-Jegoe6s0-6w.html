brought to you by phantom glass visit
store phantom glass for the best darn
screen protectors out there as well as
hyperx alright guys welcome to the
origin sweet and welcome to one of the
coolest things I've seen at CES 2015
this year this is the Aeon 17 X and also
the Aeon 15 X the only difference
between these two laptops is their size
15 inch screen 17 inch screen it has a
desktop freaking processor it has a 47
90k and it has one that's overclocked
not even stock speeds are not
underclocked it's running at 4.5
gigahertz on every freaking core that's
four cores overclocked and it doesn't
throttle it's completely fine for other
freaking crazy performance metrics it
also has a GTX 980 em with 8 gigabytes
of memory the screen is a 1080p screen
but it has supports 4k output on its
display ports so you could easily plug
this into a 4k TV or 4k monitor and get
that 4k awesome gaming that you want to
do now you might be wondering why do i
need this crazy processor in my laptop
especially people like us who might be
editing videos or streamers who might be
using xsplit or something that uses a
lot of your cpu when you're on the road
it could be crazy helpful some games are
also cpu dependent not a ton of them but
some of them are so that might not be
for everyone but the people that do need
this will greatly appreciate it this
laptop is also 37.5 percent thinner and
thirty percent lighter than the
predecessor full-size desktop processor
laptop from origin the keyboard is
fairly standard fare it's a backlit
keyboard no actual real problems here
the mouse tracking pad is fairly normal
but I do like that they're separated
independent left and right clicks and
some people will also appreciate the
fingerprint reader right in the middle
in terms of i/o on the left hand side we
have Ethernet triple USB three adi SD
MMC port and a aceite USB combo port on
the back side you have your beefy
monstrous power jack a HDMI out and dual
display port full-size DisplayPort out
on the right hand side you have one USB
3.0 eck quad audio jacks and a
Kensington lock in terms of audio
they're running a sound blaster x 53 and
the general aesthetics of the machine
are able to be changed this one that we
have here is a sleek matte-black but it
origin pc you can get a custom paint job
you get some of their other stock colors
pretty much whatever the heck you want
to do on the bottom they have five
fairly large rubbery feet so you won't
have to worry about this thing scooting
around on you while your gaming they
also a subwoofer port and easy access to
your battery storage and RAM slots under
the computer which is nice because we're
seeing some computers now these days
where you can't change things and that's
really frustrating alright guys thanks
for joining me at the origin suite if
you want a laptop of the full-size
desktop processor in it let me know in
the comments down below thank you to
phantom glass for sending us here this
year and protecting our phones like they
always do also we have a pretty cool
video from them coming up soon so stay
tuned for that thank you to hyperx as
well check out the youtube channel
youtube.com slash hyperx they've got
some pretty cool gaming content and I
think they're getting close to a hundred
thousand subscribers or even over it now

watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
