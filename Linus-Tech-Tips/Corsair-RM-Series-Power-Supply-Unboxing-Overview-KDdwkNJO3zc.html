learn more welcome to my unboxing an
overview of what might be the most quiet
optimized power supply that we've yet
encountered this is the new RM series
from Corsair and it's kind of a
replacement for the TX M v2 so that is
their TX modular series so as you might
expect it is a modular power supply
which means the cables are not pre
attached and what you also might not
expect is that it has what Corsair is
calling their hmm 0 rpm fan mode so
they've brought this down from the ax
and ax I Series to the RM series so your
fan actually is not even going to spin
up at all until you reach about 40
percent load so this is your typical
power supply fan curve compared to their
zero rpm fan curve now with all of that
said this isn't the first time we've
ever seen this feature in fact it's been
around for kind of a while the power
supply in my system doesn't have its fan
spin up until it's under a fairly
significant load but it's the first time
that we've seen a manufacturer optimized
for silence in a way that goes beyond
having the fan not spin so we've
actually got a closed cell foam inside
here for packaging and we're going to go
ahead and open this baby up so what
Corsair has done is they've optimized
the fan blades on the 135 or 140
millimeter fan whatever they're calling
it they're usually around the same size
to reduce turbulence okay so it's not
the first time we've heard a
manufacturer say yes optimized fan
design or okay but what they've really
done is they have hand selected the
components inside the power supply to
not only not make noise with the
actively moving stuff but to not make
like weird electrical buzzing noises and
whining noises which are often referred
to as coil whine even though there's a
wide variety of components inside
electronic devices that can cause this
kind of noise so that means and I don't
know if you guys have ever seen this
before but I certainly have I've seen
fanless power supplies that make
annoying noises in fact my power supply
which is an XFX thousand watt Platt
them has a ticking noise that is audible
even when the fans not spinning at all
but I personally appreciate this kind of
an optimization and I'm excited to find
out if it actually ends up working so
let's take you guys on a bit of a tour
of the product itself they've got a
little warning sticker here that says yo
the fans not spinning it's okay because
it's designed to do that we've also got
a nice open honeycomb mesh at the back
and it otherwise looks pretty much like
any other course our power supply
they've got a bit of sort of rounded
corner thing going on and those are M
logos on the side are right side up
regardless of how you install it in your
system on the front of the power supply
or back or whatever you want to call
this on this side you find the modular
interface so your 24 pin cable goes here
you have five spots for either four plus
four pin for your CPU or six plus two
pin for PCI Express so that's four total
PCIe and one TPU connector five
peripheral connectors and a corsair link
connector another thing that's a little
bit unique and special about this power
supply is the fully flat modular cables
even the 24 pin is using a flat cable
design that is extremely low-profile I
love this even going back to Corsairs
original HX series power supplies they
had the flat cables on molex and SATA
however this is the first time I've
personally seen the flat cable approach
taken with 24 pin as well as with 6 + 2
C nice flat there's your 8 wires and
otherwise it's completely flat as well
as the 4 + 4 pin this makes cable
management easier even if you don't
happen to have a case that's great for
cable management so kudos to Corsair for
thinking of that and implementing it
because it's actually not that easy to
get factories to do things like this
there's a lot of there's a lot of ease
of assembly stuff that goes along with
color coding things which is why they
like to color code them at the factory
and manufacturing level so there's a
little tidbit for you guys in terms of
included connectors we've got two 4-pin
molex harnesses each with four
connectors on them and then we have
three SATA harnesses that are somewhere
in here okay two of them have three
connectors on them and the last one has
four connectors on it it also has the
corsair link cable included remember
guys unlike the ax i series this is a
deep
gold instead of platinum and it doesn't
have quite the same degree of
integration with course or link but it
will allow you to see things like fan
rpm monitoring and power usage
monitoring which is kind of nice and
then finally you've got one CPU cable
and four PCI Express six plus two pin
connectors and you should be able to
pretty much fill this baby up with all
that stuff to molex to a floppy
connectors if you really still feel the
need for those a QuickStart guide as
well as some included cable ties of
course our case badge and some included
screws last thing I wanted to show you
guys is is sample only so this is a
sample power supply is the distribution
of the rail so it's a single 12 volt
70.8 amp rail that is capable of
providing the entire 850 watts that this
power supply can supply so that tells us
that the 3.3 volt and 5 volt rails are
actually derived from the 12 volt rail
this is an approach that we've been
seeing for quite a while here it comes
with a five year warranty something I
often forget to mention in my unboxings
and I think that pretty much wraps it up
thank you for checking out my unboxing
and overview of the rme series power
supplies from corsair these are silence
optimized that's the biggest thing you
need to remember don't forget to

videos like this video if you liked it
dislike it if you disliked it and let me
know in the comments do you even care if
your power supplies silent I do but that
doesn't mean everyone does so like to
hear what you think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
