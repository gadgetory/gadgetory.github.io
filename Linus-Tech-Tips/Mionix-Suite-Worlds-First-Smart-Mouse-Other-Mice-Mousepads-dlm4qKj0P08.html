brought to you by phantom glass visit
store dot phantom glass for the best
darn screen protectors out there as well
as hyperx our guys welcome to the me
onyx sweet we're checking out a few
different mice and some most pads while
we're here but mainly the mayos qg which
is essentially the nayo 7000 but with
some upgrades it now has some tracking
ability for your actions your movement
data your heartbeat and even your skin
response my favorite thing about this is
actually that it's running on an open
API so anyone can actually access this
data at any time they even have stuff
like twitch hook set up so if you're
streaming a game you can have it read
your heartbeat and maybe skin response
on screen and even people that you're
playing with can have their data
streamed to your computer so you can see
it as an overlay while you're playing
pretty cool because I know a lot of
youtubers and game streamers are doing
horror games because they're
entertaining to watch imagine you could
see someone's heart rate while they're
playing in that game if you're in a
little bit more of a competitive mindset
however you can access the logs of your
data in like timelapses and stuff like
that to figure out exactly how you did
during different games there's a lot of
different applications for its
professional FPS players professional
mobile players to even people like poker
players to figure out where their
heartbeat was spiking during previous
games now it is a 16.8 or they told me
16.7 something something something
something million color RGB mouse so
just in case you wanted 16.8 million
color options you can also do that on
your mouse but it is set up by default
to change color based on your heart rate
which is kind of actually cool also it
has a release date of August so if
you're looking for it you can pick it up
then and they're still working out a few
different little things like where to
place the sensors this isn't really
going to work out super great for me
specifically because I actually claw
grip pretty much every Mouse I've ever
used so having a sensor position for
someone who's going to claw grip
everything aggressively is a little
weird now if you're palming or doing
kind of like a more relaxed claw grip it
might not be too bad I've seen two
different positions that they've used
that are actually pretty good for both
of those grips so hopefully their final
position will be fairly well optimized
for most people if you're interested in
that Mouse you can check out their
Kickstarter page which should be in the
description below but there's
so another mouse here called the caster
which is essentially on the inside the
same as an AO 7000 same as the last one
it has a 3310 optical sensor 32 bit 32
megahertz ARM processor and has 20
million press omron switches on the left
and right clicks that will be releasing
around March and is mostly an ergonomics
change the only actual change in buttons
is that as a six button mouse instead of
a seven button Mouse having one less dpi
switch us but potentially not least if
you're in the market for a new mouse pad
is there sargis and alley off mousepads
their alley off mouse pads are new and
have really nice stitching around the
outside and a little bit thicker more
premium mousepads there sargis mouse
pads which have already existed have had
a few minor changes mainly in the price
department they've had a massive price
drop in some regions up to fifty percent
so the North American region it went
from a twenty dollar to a nine dollar
price market which is pretty sweet if
you're looking for a new mouse pad
