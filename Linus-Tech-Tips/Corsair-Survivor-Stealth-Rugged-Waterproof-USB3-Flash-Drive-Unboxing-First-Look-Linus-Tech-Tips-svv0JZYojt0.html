at the Corsair sorry Rumble flash
survivor 64 gig so this is the stealth
version of their survivor USB drive now
I've been using a survivor for over
three years now this one is pretty
beat-up so if you get in really close
you can see from having my keychain on
it I actually ripped right through the
keyring loop however the other side
still holding out okay what this one
this are rubber grip has actually worn
completely clean and the other one fell
off at some point however it is still
waterproof to this day it was run over
it was thrown around it's been
underwater and it still functions it's
also only USB 2 with the survivor
stealth Corsair has improved pretty much
every aspect of this drive which as you
can see like I've been carrying this for
three years on my keychain which as you
can see I am a big fan of because I love
having the durability of something that
I know is basically incapable of dying
has a five-year warranty and so it
should use as light weight aircraft
grade aluminum just like the original
this one's waterproof to 200 meters has
USB 3 compatibility so it's much much
faster than the original Drive it is
yeah it's got an aluminum housing yeah
yeah it's also much sexier looking so
you can see but oh yeah the labels came
off it used to say of course their
survivor on it but now you go there you
go so the size is very similar although
the rubber pieces are bigger and this is
nice because when you're opening it up
those are your grips and that's what
makes it that's what makes it easier to
come off so that's that's why this one
this one came off on my old one but
there you go it's got that stealth
branding it's got a very nice black
anodized finish you can see they've
beefed up the keyring loop very
substantially because you see how thin
the aluminum was around the top there
and it was the same on the other side
now it's much thicker so it's gonna be
much less likely to come off also decide
with the flash drive is the side that's
going to be attached to your device
which as you guys can see was the side I
preferred that was where I first
attached it to USB 3 you can tell from
the blue here as well as the additional
pins inside comes in a variety of sizes
this is a 64 gig one also
it's got an indicator LED I don't know
Wi-Fi here I'm just gonna put this here
so you guys can see it while I check out
the other one I don't know if the old
one yeah I did okay so the design is
very similar inside as well so there's
my old 32 gig this is the new 64 gig if
you guys can't already tell from the top
there so I think that pretty much
summarizes it thank you for checking out
my unboxing and first look at the
Corsair survivors stealth USB thumb
drive don't forget to subscribe to Lions
tech tips from Run boxing's reviews and
other computer videos and the cameraman
reminds me that it's shockproof to 1500
G's like a G and it's of course
cat-proof as well let's see if I can get
him to bite it sometimes they'll bite
stuff if you put it on his head I'm
gonna fight it you know buddy you
invited me buddy
ha
there he goes
and he's distracted
I should be using me everyone for this
okay the footage I think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
