unboxing the Xbox 360 PC controller and
we are using the LifeCam
home cinema in order to do our recording
so I'm just gonna use my remote here to
kind of hone in on the on the life sorry
not on the life cam on the Xbox 360
no I'm just kidding actually it's the
cameraman who's holding the the webcam
at the top of the screen so I'm gonna
put it down on the table okay let's get
this thing open so you can see it
includes a white wireless Xbox 360
controller as well as a little dongle
here so we're gonna explain what that's
for this wireless controller can as I
mentioned before be used with either the
Xbox 360 or the PC so with games like
Batman Arkham Asylum where their Xbox
are sorry not Xbox where their games for
Windows enabled and there by default
compatible with the Xbox 360 controller
that kind of thing can be really useful
because you don't have to do any
configuration to get this controller
working with games like that so let's
have a look at it standard Xbox
controller you got your four buttons
here ABXY you got your start your back
your Xbox button two analog sticks and a
d-pad then on the top you got your two
trigger buttons and two shoulder buttons
and one more button that I'm assuming is
for connecting to the USB dongle
speaking of which let's talk about the
USB dongle here so the USB dongle it
says okay install software first so you
want to install the software for your
Xbox 360 controller receiver before you
actually plug it into the computer
there's a button here on the top that
I'm having kind of a hard time showing
you but yeah there it is
there's a button right there you press
that button and that's how you sync up
with your controller it actually
supports up to four controllers at a
time so you only need to buy one of the
controllers with the dongle and then you
can pick up like the refurb ones that we
have on sale from time to time and then
you can connect those to it as well and
you can get some multiplayer gaming
action
so it comes with two Duracell double-a
batteries and so those installed here in
the battery compartment and I guess
that's what that the cameraman is
probably going to be gesturing to me in
it yeah here help me you hold the button
and then you oh cool okay so you hold
the button and then pry it back awesome
can you tell I'm not much of an Xbox
gamer uh and then you install it like
that
okay so you put those in there and then
you put the whole thing back oh no I get
it
you put them oh wow this is very
complicated so you put the batteries
inside this little cartridge and you put
them in this way okay yeah you put them
in like this and then you install the
little cartridge into the back of the
Xbox 360 controller there we go it's got
a little bit more weight to it now
anyway thank you for checking out my
video unboxing of the Xbox 360
controller oh I have to stop it now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
