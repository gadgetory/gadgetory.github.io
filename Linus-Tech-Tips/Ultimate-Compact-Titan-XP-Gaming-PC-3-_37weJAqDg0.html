scrolling text inch or whatever you guys
get it so anyway the Dan cases a for SFX
was a great if imperfect step in the
direction of ultimate compact gaming it
allowed a full-size GPU which is great
but it forced you to compromise on CPU
cooling meaning that our xeon e5 2699 v4
and last time around wasn't able to
reach quite its full potential well stay
tuned because with the a4 s FX v2 we
were able to one-up every small
form-factor PC we've ever built again
speaking of one-upping today's video is
brought to you by Mac Weldon one up your

at the link below
okay so step one was to outfit our build
with the fastest and sweetest gaming
card on the market the Jedi Order Star
Wars collector's edition Titan XP step
two then was to actually trade some
course from our zeal and last time
around for the much higher clocks on an
Intel Core i 979 ATX II this thing runs
at up to 800 megahertz higher so we
already know from our review that the
kora 970 900 X outperforms the $26.99 v4
in many workloads so the 79 80 XC we're
expecting that to totally smoked it
there's one small problem though the
area for the CPU cooler on this case is
right here it is literally small and
that CPU is a 165 watt part putting it
at roughly 12 to 13% higher thermal
output compared to our last ultimate
compact build and if you guys recall the
all copper dinah tron vapor chamber
cooler that we used previously hid
around 80 degrees under load so we're
gonna get to the real solution in a
minute here but first let's walk through
the process we started by breaking out
the dare bauer x 299 d living tool
popping the IHS and applying some
thermal grisly conduct a not we're gonna
need every advantage we can get here so
yes my friends you've been begging us to
do it and here it is a liquid metal
infused 79 80 XE but what to put on it
ahh how about an NHL 12 this this looks
pretty good right just put that on there
and o temps are good too but that's
outside the case and it's also nowhere
even close to fitting and it can't be
cut to fit so back to the drawing board
well we had some success with our Dyna
Tron cooler last time
so how about we just grab the square ilm
version of what is essentially the same
cooler so you can just see it has a
different screw layout and success sort
of see while we were able to get
reasonable temperatures with this thing
we also had to use a knock to a 120
millimeter industrial fan in order to
get them which wouldn't be so much of a
problem if we didn't also need this 92
millimeter adapter to ensure proper
airflow over the CPU heatsink and around
the socket and that whole arrangement
just won't fit and our low-profile fans
didn't cut it so by this point we had
completely exhausted our stock of
compatible coolers before finally coming
to a realization the a4 s FX v2 has a
mount for a 92 millimeter radiator so
that's why this video ended up delayed
there are very few a iOS out there this
size none of which we had on hand so
after a trip to ASA Tech's website and
another week of waiting our 545 LC
arrived this thing is not much to look
at honestly and we weren't really
expecting it to perform much better than
our Dyna Tron cooler did but when we
fired it up for a dry run
not bad after two and a half hours at
stock voltage under full synthetic load
our 18 core 79 80 XE had a maximum of 68
degrees Celsius on any one core d living
man water drug on a 92 millimeter cooler
anyway next order of business then is to
get it all together and this is no small
task the ass rock x2 990 ITX a/c and
other board with its 64 gigs of g.skill
ripjaws memory and coarser nvme SSDs and
raid zero are easy enough as is the GPU
but the cooler required us to remove the
front USB 3 port the lower drive tray
and the side panel clips at the front of
the case in order to get it mounted
properly and to make matters worse even
with the 14 millimeter variant of the
knot to a 9fen getting an SFX power
supply in there is an absolute nightmare
with some determination though and a
healthy serving of elbow grease we got
it all in so we just need one final
check to make sure that everything is
bolted in correctly and nothing's
obstructed and our fan spins moment of
truth time oh damn it
did we leave the power supply switch off
oh crap yep Hey all right moment of
truth time
I wonder what that is no I don't have
time for this
so this is not bad like it is not
elegant to get the cooler in there at
all
and like you could even potentially
damage stuff trying to cram all of that
in there but the results we can't really
criticize running a CPU and GPU
synthetic load it's topping out at just
over ninety degrees Celsius on the
hottest core like that's hot but it's
also not thermal throttling now let's
look at some GPU specific tests so we've
had the Unigine super position stress
test running for almost ten minutes now
I'm wearing my microphone here so you
can hear it's actually pretty quiet and
check this out we're seeing turbo speeds
up around 1580 16 2016 13 mega Hertz not
freaking bad and as for the rest of the
benchmarks both synthetic and real-world
this thing has absolutely chewed through
them we are really seeing the hardware
not just work but actually flex its
muscle so in the end then the success
that we saw here goes to show you just
how much power you can pack into a tiny
space like the a4 s FX v2 without making
any compromises on performance I mean
halfway through this project we flat out
didn't expect it to work but we're
really glad that it did this video is
brought to you by the arctic freezer
eSports one it's part of their freezer
series with other products including the
freezer eSports Edition with two fans
and freezer eSports tr4 thread ripper it
comes in four different color variations
red white yellow and green and it's at
our CPU cooler with a push-pull fan
configuration their new bionics fans are
optimized for very low vibration and
they have a promotion going on right now
where you can pick it up for just $29.99
USD and their MX for thermal compound is
also a great accompanying item for it
