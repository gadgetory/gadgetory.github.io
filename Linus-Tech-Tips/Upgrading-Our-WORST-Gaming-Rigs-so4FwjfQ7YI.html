Media Group spends their day playing
with and making videos about the latest
and greatest technology toys you
probably think that our entire team here
has like sick AF gaming machines at home
right state-of-the-art you'd think wrong
so I had everyone in the company submit
photos and specs of their personal
setups to me without telling them why I
wanted to see them and some folks were
pretty reluctant to show them I mean
don't you guys trust me well it turns
out they should have trusted their
instincts not to trust me because the
plan was to pick the worst three and
subject them to a healthy dose of public
shaming
welcome to the Linus Media Group Wall of
shame but with a surprise twist the
worst rig as determined by our highly
qualified panel of judges gets an
upgrade courtesy of Intel who sponsored
this video so let's get this show on the
road
some of the submissions actually weren't
half bad and some of them were pretty
darn nice I mean let me know in the
comments if you guys want to see a
follow up Wall of Fame some of them
contain totally unnecessary details like
Ivan
for example apparently games by
candlelight but his was far from the
worst let's begin our journey with
someone that you are just meeting for
the first time because he only recently
passed his probation this is Lloyd's
setup he's our new graphic designer
slash merchandise manager so to his
credit he has done some pretty amazing
work so far for the company including
our new logo you can let him know what
you think of that in the comments below
but brace yourselves my friends because
this is gonna be a shocker so what do
you got nobody go oh okay
he does win some bonus points because
this is some of the most amazing shadow
box decor that I think I've ever seen is
this your Game Boy Color yeah yeah
alright and this is this is your
original Game Boy with your red and blue
no oh this is a film camera that's a
phone camera okay so you sir you're kind
of a photography nerd okay
right cuz there's so many lenses back
here I can't even tell you get it gonna
gotta get a shot of this look at this so
you have an iMac you have an iMac 5k how
much did this bad boy cost you my
parents gave it to me as a gift
Wow nice parents so you got a 4
gigahertz core i7 you've got 32 gigs of
ram this is a pretty tricked-out machine
nothing actually that's oh yeah you guys
might be wondering how this guy even got
a job here and the answer is at least
he's a gamer
oh the Pokemon fandom is real alright so
at least he gets some street cred points
for that who's next for The Wall of
shame let me give you one hint as I take
off my feet to take off my feet goddamn
it as I remove my shoes to enter his
domicile yes my friends in his Dennis
you might know him as dad
is hung from his gaming and cooking
streams kami 40 where's this so hard
look I know how to do it but when it
comes to his PC setup he comes up a
little short
Dennis do you just not do dishes like
are these just do you use disposable
cups for everything no oh my god they're
dirty I watch them and did you just play
a lot of beer pong it's quite the system
for your for your paddle storage up here
I don't know you're into boating well at
least you're consistent because your
kayak setup is every bit as clean and
organized as your PC yeah you will
you'll love it
so here it is this is the gaming corner
yes of shame so you got a fake cockroach
is not working but you don't know what
happened a lot of money so I can squeeze
any time
see if I can find anything that was
stolen from the office yes why do you
have this projector hey I wound up on
the quiz oh you won that already okay
all right all right okay I also still I
guarantee I bought it I pay for this I I
went to bitch best microfiber walk me
through your setup play so my sit ups
very simple very easy everyone can do it
at home basically steal your steal your
keep the keyboard at miles from your
work I don't know where you work but and
I have four coasters and I used to live
on my laptop so the hand the heat can
come off from here that's actually not
the stupidest thing I've ever heard
these are like fin see wow these are
like marble or something you steal these
from the Louvre they match
no no no this is mine no yeah this is
not linus media group problem so you ask
Brandon if you could take my stuff is it
yeah we don't use it so this is actually
pretty good hardware Dennis is rocking a
6700 HQ he's got a GTX ten sick
I just found no you stole more stuff
okay I wasn't even looking for one tech
items I bet you took all these games oh
the karaoke mic okay I pay for this I
pay for this I reimbursed you this is
the apartment of Laser James what's my
name you told me your name with big papa
I could never forget that I probably
wouldn't have hired this guy if I'd
known the state of his computer where it
where is your computer right this way
so you walk past the Google home in the
chromecast and all the Philips you
lights in the smart lock and the kitty
litter it's not about having the
greatest speck in the world that's not
what pc master race is PCMR is proper
respect for the PC and the hardware in
it such as it is this is not proper
respect for the for the PC
high-performance battling drone okay
that's pretty cool
collecting dust really I have a
Microsoft Surface pro that's my daily
driver speaking of all your smart home
device crap did you steal this from the
office yeah
oh it's kibble do you still want me to
throw it in your mouth oh it smell it
tastes like dog breath it's gonna wash
out my mouth here okay so you have no
room for a gaming PC but you've got like
a bunch of quails I mean look at the oh
wow what if they get out can they fly
are they wings clipped her there
probably is that one's name okay and you
eat the eggs and is that covered in poo
or is that just the color what they look
okay cool
x58 so if you had a decent rig at one
point and you abandoned us I didn't
really I stopped gaming hey man
I'm married now okay it's a different
world if we fix this up will you hook it
up I've actually been wanting to watch
less Netflix and play more video games I
think it's a good husband wife activity
do you know how many people out there
have socket 1366 chips and would die for
a working x58 motherboard and yours is
just sitting collecting dust you don't
know that it works
whoa oh my god
okay so your job for this part is to
stand there and look ashamed look at ya
head down more shame thank you James
that's good shame we're handing James's
machine over to Ivan who is going to be
revitalizing it
all right bring him in so congratulation
James you suck but it worked out for you
because we just can't have someone on
staff who's not able to hone their
gaming skills so we're gonna take this
off and so Intel and actually some of
our other partners went all out I
thought you were just getting a CPU
motherboard and RAM upgrade but this
thing is actually tricked the math right
out so you got a core i7 8700 K a 760
series nvme SSD you've got an asus strix
motherboard
you've got 16 gigs of Corsair Vengeance
Pro RGB memory you've got an h-60 cooler
so this is their new upgraded one with
the new fans and all that kind of stuff
you've got RGB lighting courtesy of
course sir and a gtx 1070 strix from
Asus
oh yeah and by the way your hard drive
is now opting accelerated so you've got
to MDOT to so even though this hard
drive is like ghetto AF 640 gigs
you should still actually get good
loading times off of the games that you
put on it you didn't get a power supply
upgrade though because I was still good
enough so this thing will actually gain
better than my machine now and of course
in true LTT fashion we left the case as
is so you can go full sleeper style you
can actually disable these lights and
software if you want no-one to be able
to tell what's under the hood
night-night
Wow there is no Segway on earth that can
get me from that awful joke to this so
let's just close this out with some
benchmark scores this machine is looking
pretty beast so for those of you
thinking you know an i7 is an i7 because
technically we did upgrade our i7 2 and
i7 we'd recommend that you keep in mind
how much better a new i7 can be than an
old one
