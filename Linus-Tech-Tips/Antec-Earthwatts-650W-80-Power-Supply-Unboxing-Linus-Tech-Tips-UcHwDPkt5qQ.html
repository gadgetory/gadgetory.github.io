to be featuring not one but two products
first of all the video is going to be
about the antic Earthwatch 650 watt
power supply but I'm also testing out a
new camera so we're testing out the m10
9 3 is Kodak camera it's got a high
quality 720p video mode so you can see
we actually started unboxing this before
but my assistant today at home had
noticed that you could see her pajamas
in the reflection off the packaging so
we had to restart so first of all let's
get that shiny packaging off there so
first thing we notice about the earth
watts is they're saying it is green it
is earth it is all about the efficiency
so you've got your 80 plus certification
and the earth what series is actually
one of the least expensive or more
supportable I should say 80 plus sort of
certified power supplies so here we go
here's all of your standard
specifications so we got three 12-volt
rails you've got active power factor
correction so that's means it accepts
any voltage input it's an ATX power
supply and it's for quiet computing so
that means Antec is advertising this as
a quiet power supply so let's get the
Box open here let's show you how its
packaged in here so along with their
green earth theme you can see that
they're not using a foam package they're
actually using like a brown recycled
paper sort of package and first of all
accessories you have got a power cable
so this is your standard computer power
cable it's got the three prongs it's got
the other three prongs there you go
there's nothing really interesting about
that you got your do not eat package
please do not eat this next we have a
piece of brown paper which we will take
off so that's that's holding together
the two sides of the paper clamshell
that's holding in the power supply and
then we have these two paper pieces here
I better be able to put this back
together because quite frankly I do not
remember how that went so then we undo
the plastic around the power
by itself and if I was able to do that I
would definitely do it there we go now
you can finally extract the enttec or
twat 650 watt okay so the first thing
you're gonna notice about it is it has a
nice big 120 millimeter fan it's a
little bit smaller than the 140
millimeter fans that we're seeing on
some other power supplies but you are
gonna get adequate ventilation from that
for sure especially for an efficient
unit like this so here you can see you
got your normal honeycomb mesh on the
back on/off switch there's no 120 to 240
volt switch that is evidence of the
active power factor correction of this
power supply on the side you're gonna
see the basic specs here so you've got
three 12-volt rails rated at a maximum
of 22 22 and 25 amps that's going to be
your most important spec you're going to
find on the side and then on the other
side we have a nanotech logo next thing
I want to show you here is actually the
connectors that are included with this
power supply so first of all I'm going
to need to get off this zip tie thing
it's one of those reusable zip ties so
if you wanted to use it as part of your
cable management scheme you could
actually do that which is kind of neat
so first of all we've got
how many whatever what are these okay we
have a six plus two pin PCI Express
connector so you can use that either for
6 pin PCI Express or 8 pin then we have
another 6 pin PCI Express connector and
then so that's one 8 pin and one 6 pin
and then we have a four pin ATX
connector and an 8 pin EPS connector so
you're only gonna use one of these two
for your for your motherboard there that
provides power to the CPU so now I'm
gonna take off this other connector here
and I really wish that it was a little
bit faster at taking these off because
man is it ever taking me a long time
there we go
let's get the rest of our connectors
going here so there is your standard 24
pin ATX connector it's a lot it's not
too long but it's not too short you're
gonna be able to use that and almost any
bottom mounted power supply case which
it makes sense because Antec was one of
the first to make that popular with the
p180 and then for the rest of our cables
here let's see what we got so we have
two sets of Sirte more molex oriented
cables so here you're gonna find
one two six molex cable connectors and
one floppy connector and then for the
other two cables here we've got two more
that each have three SATA connectors so
for them our right angle which looks
like this and the other two are just
straight connectors like that so thank
you for checking out my video blog on
the enttec Earthwatch 650 watt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
