the phobia balancer 150 gold plated
edition it comes with a three-year
warranty which unlike most cooling
products where I don't kind of go oh
okay it has a three year warranty at the
heatsink what could possibly go wrong
water cooling components I do appreciate
seeing a bit of a longer warranty on
because they can leak over time and it
can have problems so having the
manufacturer stand behind it holy crap
this thing is heavy I already love it is
a good thing
so okay see what else is in here we got
some mounting hardware we got some sort
of some G 1/4 inch threaded plugs that's
a G 1/4 inch I think it's just G 1/4 I
can't remember any more do you want
quarter-inch yeah look at that I'm not
that out of the game mounting threads
for times m42 times m6 usable for
installation pressure tested to 2 bar
and made of gold-plated brass and plexi
yes that is what I'm excited about about
the 150 this is a fairly small radiator
radiator reservoir but check this out it
actually has gold-plated brass there you
go on the bottom and the top of the tube
so 150 refers to the actual length of
the reservoir so it's available in a
variety of configurations you can get I
believe it's a 250 or even a 400
millimeter so in inches that be
approximately six twelve and like 20
inches or some 18 inches or something
along those lines included accessories
so here you go you've got plugs because
there are a variety of different options
in terms of the fill port as well as the
inlet and outlet so you're gonna plug
the top no matter what so you'll open
that up just to fill it and then on the
bottom you can either go in and out here
and then you can plug these two on the
bottom or you can go in and out on the
bottom and you can plug the two on the
top so you're gonna have to provide your
own fittings for the rest of the holes
which is just two additional ones and I
would definitely recommend getting some
gold-plated fittings to go with this
thing because that would be pretty
awesome
now inside you can
see that there's actually a baffle
included it's a thick piece of plexi
it's nice it's actually quite clear
hopefully you can see that so there's a
baffle included so as the water comes in
one side you can get air bubbles that'll
just get sucked right into like so it'll
come in here and there will be air
bubbles and then it'll get sucked right
back out the other side so the air never
settles in the reservoir putting in a
baffle like this prevents that from
happening because it means that the
water has to go up and around giving the
bubbles time to escape and go up to the
top of the rez rather than just being
like like this also having it extend up
like this with these holes prevents the
tornado effect which can cause there to
be sucked in as well so that was a
problem with older residents
particularly coming in from the bottom
here as opposed to the bottom here where
it would cause a vortex inside to make
an air pocket that would travel down to
the bottom and get sucked up so that is
all taken care of and the threads on
here are pretty heavy-duty as well
actually here you can see the rubber
seal here and basically why would you
want a product like this well if you
have a custom water cooling loop sorry
I'm just gonna tighten this up if you
have a custom water cooling loop then
you're gonna need a reservoir of some
sort anyway and personally I'm not a
huge fan of a reservoir so they have a
lot of points of failure that's what I
don't like about them they have a lot of
different places where the acrylic or
plexi is typically glued which makes me
kind of uncomfortable because over time
plexi cracks especially if you use UV
lighting especially if it's subject to
heat especially if this and that and
that and that and all these things so
those glue joints can crack there's only
a couple reservoirs that really have a
good reputation for reliability that are
made of glued plexi things like the MC
razz micro from Swift Tech whereas most
of the Bay res is out there have huge
problems with breakages over time so I
like a solid piece of acrylic with
rubber seals at either end so I like
cylinder reza's and that's where was I
going with this right you'll need a
reservoir anyway so you might as well if
you can't use a bay you might as well
use something that you can show off and
you can have people look at so one of
the other ones I like is the t-virus and
if I wasn't going to do that if I was
say for example doing a gold beamed
build then something like this might be
a pretty good option don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips from
boxing's reviews and other computer
videos and I mistakenly ordered an
additional hold down bracket for this
thinking that it didn't come with a high
quality one but it does so right oh yeah
I should probably mention that it comes
with an extremely robust mounting
bracket check that out
so there's foam inside to prevent it
from being scratched and yeah just put
it on or well no cash or the foam first
so foam inside to prevent it from being
scratch or anything bad from happening
to it very solid construction here so
you can screw it in with either three or
two mounting spots here I would probably
use these two because it's at least two
don't look that useful
there's probably instructions actually
they're Orange okay well you'll figure
it out here's the mounting screws I'd
probably go with these two on the on the
ends here I was going to do anything so
you just kind of oh you're gonna have to
stretch it this was what bugs me about
cylinder reservoirs you have to just
kind of go like this with them and clip
them in and I always worry about
scratching the I worry about scratching
the tube but I guess I could just kind
of man up you know what I'm not gonna do
it I'll do it when I have all the tools
that I can do it without scratching it
