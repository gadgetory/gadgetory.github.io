the funk HS to 60s come in a white box
and we I guess we could do like a sort
of pseudo unboxing there's really not
much inside though they have a fairly
bare-bones accessory package which goes
along with the you know fairly
value-oriented pricing of them so they
come with the headphones the microphone
which is right here the cable which has
a black and orange sort of color scheme
just like we've seen with their other
peripherals it's quite long it's
approximately you know to Linus arm
spans and finally replacement pleather
ear cups the pleather ones are easy to
swap and take less than a minute per ear
cup if you use the right technique but I
really preferred the cloth ear cups on
the HS 260 I felt they improved sound
quality at the cost of a little bit less
noise isolation but that it was a
worthwhile trade-off and apparently funk
thought so too because they ship by
default with the cloth ones so I went
ahead and I I left that I left these off
so what can I say about the Mull they're
a little bit on the heavier side but
then maybe I don't mind them a little on
the heavier side and they're I mean
they're not unreasonable or anything
they're quite similar to the Vengeance
1400s from Corsair with all plastic
construction there it's a little tough
to achieve a premium feel but I still
think they've done a fairly good job
there the soft touch finish helps a lot
and a couple of tastefully applied shiny
plastic accents also help a little bit
like on the ear cup right here the ear
cups themselves in terms of ergonomics
here have a tiny little bit of swivel
but no more than necessary so if you
like to fold them flat when you put your
headset around your neck you can pretty
much forget about that the headband is
one area where the build quality looks a
little bit janky if you twist it around
like this but it actually holds together
quite well now this is a cool little
ergonomic trick you can actually plug
the mic or the three-and-a-half
millimeter cable into either port on the
bottom of the headset that's cool I mean
to me it's a bit of a fringe case
because I think we're mostly used to the
cable coming up on the left hand side
and our you know cable management
being built around that and I generally
don't like detachable stuff it tends to
get lost whenever I'm around but this is
something that's very much personal
taste and you guys could completely
disagree with me about it
so let me know in the comments do you
like the flex cable swappable designer
do you just think it doesn't matter at
all the flexible Mike on the other hand
is a big plus in my eyes and gives the
HS 260 a big leg up on its main
competitor the Vengeance 1400 which has
a boom mic that lowers instead placement
of a flexible mic at the corner of your
mouth is much easier than one that just
lowers and is whatever sort of distance
in front of your mouth as it wants to be
raised this one you can put wherever you
need to another great ergonomic choice
on these headphones is the inclusion of
on ear controls for both volume and the
microphone mute when you compare that
with fussing about trying to find an
inline control pod this is a great step
forward and something that we've started
to see a little bit more of now in terms
of fit they seal adequately on my head
in spite of the large thickly padded ear
cups they're a touch on the heavy side
as I mentioned before but the good news
is that the headband is wide and the
padding is thick with that said it's a
fairly hard foam in here so it will take
some break in time before it molds to
the shape of your head but once it does
it should pretty much fit like a glove
I wish comfort wise that they actually
had a little bit more clamping force out
of the box this would improve bass
response a touch and would also allow
the headband to put a little bit less
pressure on my head but the flipside of
that is that people with larger heads
mine's a medium would likely be
uncomfortable out of the box and you're
better off going with something that
feels okay to everyone out of the box
and breaks in then going with something
that's uncomfortable to people might
cause them to return it so they get a
gold star from me for comfort there were
no obvious problems all right so let's
get into listing tests when I fire up
gaming headphones I'm basically
expecting a bass heavy mess but maybe
everyone is just growing out of that now
the overall sound signature of the HS
260 s is actually fairly flat and funk
was even willing to provide the
frequency response curve when I asked
them it's nice to be them to see them be
so upfront with the specs of their
headphones this is a significant
difference at this point in my my
between funk and their competition who
simply provide that meaningless
frequency response range on the box
bear in mind though that if I were to
compare them to audiophile grade
headphones that are available near this
price range such as the ever-popular
audio technica ATM 50s which can
sometimes be found for as little as a
hundred bucks the HS sixty to sixty s do
fall short I mean I think we're a long
way away from a headset an all-in-one
type product made by a gaming company
competing at a similar price range with
a dedicated pair of headphones from an
experienced audio company I mean this is
this should be fairly intuitive and is
similar to the whole phone versus a
dedicated camera conversation yes a
proper dedicated device is going to take
better pictures than this I mean you can
even make the argument that it's better
to carry a flip phone a camera a
portable gaming system a flashlight a
level I'm sure you see where I'm going
with this
I'm compared to a jack-of-all-trades
device and you might be right but ah
it's not for everyone I mean I don't use
a headset anymore
I've put on my big boy pants and I now
have a mod mic that I can clip with
magic I mean a magnet to whatever pair
of audiophile grade headphones I happen
to be using at the time and that works
great for me but the cold hard truth is
that not everyone wants that solution
and so for the folks who are only
shopping for hundred ish dollar headsets
I did all of my comparative listening
with the HS 260s
against its competition the razer kraken
pro the SteelSeries Siberia v2 s and the
Corsair Vengeance 1400 s to start with
the HS 260 and the Vengeance 1400 sat
about in the middle for me in terms of
bass boom they managed to make
explosions and other action noises you
know shake without drowning out
everything else the way that the Kraken
pros did making those very very
difficult for me to listen to and very
difficult for me to recommend i'm
compared to the Siberia v2 s they
definitely delivered more punch for me
but during my listening tests I actually
made a bit of a personal discovery I had
always wondered what all the fuss was
with the Siberia v2 s sure they're
incredibly lightweight they're
inexpensive
but they always sounded horrible to me
the issue is that they don't seal
correctly on my head there's a gap down
here and they use a one-size-fits-all
suspension system so I can't even adjust
them that makes their bass response
absolutely abysmal on my head
by using my hands to actually push them
down onto my head they still don't boom
the way that any of the others do but
the bass is quite tight and responsive
and not completely absent so while
there's still not a good choice for me
at all I at least get it now as far as
mids go they were full and not obscured
by bass making them more suitable for
music than the Siberia v2 s which even
with the manual correction are stronger
in both the high and low ranges and then
where highs were concerned compared to
the Siberia of u2's the HS to 60s didn't
seem as clear and detailed but they did
sound better than the Vengeance 1400s in
this department overall if I had to
describe them as like something but
different I'd say they are similar to
the Vengeance 1400s but with less bass
oomph and a little more detail in the
highs which is not a bad place for them
to be which leaves us with the mic test
go ahead and have a listen this is my
microphone test on the funk HS 260 I
hope you guys enjoyed it ok I think
we're back now so considering that they
come in at slightly more expensive than
the Siberia of u2's and sound better
with a much better mic and that they
sound similar to the Vengeance 1400s and
our price similarly to the Vengeance
1400s with what I'd consider to be a
slightly better sounding mic and
improved ergonomics with the on ear
controls the HS 260 looks like yet
another solid product from funk so I
think that's pretty much all there is to
say liked this video if you liked it
dislike it if you disliked it leave a
