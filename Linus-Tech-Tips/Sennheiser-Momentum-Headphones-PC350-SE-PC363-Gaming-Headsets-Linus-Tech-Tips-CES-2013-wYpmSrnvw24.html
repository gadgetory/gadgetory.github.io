take a look at some of the most exciting
products that they're showing off this
one is all over the booth you guys have
what at least like 20 of them on display
here so this is the momentum circumaural
headphone headset whatever you want to
call it it does have a mic built in with
volume control and track skipping is
made of metal so this is a very premium
product and we've got Scott from
sennheiser here to tell us a little bit
more about what makes the momentum so
special well with the momentum we're
taking a a retro look at the headphones
of very very similar to Sennheiser's
past we're using leather ear cushions
leather headband replaceable in line
cord so the cord if something were to
happen it is replaceable everything is
modular here with the all-metal headband
design very durable you know can stand
to be thrown in the bag taken with you
good on commutes the cushions with it
being the soft leather great for
isolation of outside noise and supplying
the best premium sound I can vouch for
that you were saying that you guys are
using a leather that's also quite
moisture and sweat resistant as well
although i'd imagine if you're carrying
something this light around on your head
you probably shouldn't sweat too much
unless you're going for a jog ya know
this would be if you're wearing them on
the plane and it gets a little hot so
won't you know you're not gonna break
your headphones just with a little
sweater so tell me why they cost three
hundred and forty-nine dollars do they
sound that awesome they do sound that
awesome this is one headphone that we
are extremely excited about especially
sound wise it brings something
completely new to the market with sound
with features that design the style at
that price point really fits in with a
lot of how the market
going today very exciting now we're
gonna head over and check out some PC
gaming headsets gaming headset wise
sennheiser has what looks like pretty
much a complete refresh of the high-end
the pc 350 has been replaced with the
350 SE the 360 has been replaced with
the 360 3d and they've got a very
exciting sort of multi-platform headset
as well so Scott why don't you start
with the 360 3d is this something that
someone like in HD 555 users such as
myself would want to upgrade to to get a
headset rather than a headphone
absolutely and it's funny you mention
that because the 360 3d also uses the
same drivers from that series of
headphone so we're giving you the
audiophile headphone quality in this
headset and then throwing on a noise
cancelling microphone a analog or USB
decoding options so you can play a 5.1
7.1 surround enabled game and get that
simulated back into the headset too
which is you know in an excellent way so
you're not doing a because there's no
good surround way for for the headsets
these days so doing it through the
decoding having it come out is a much
more accurate much more lifelike
response I actually have a lot of people
a lot of viewers asked me about getting
7.1 headsets with the actual sort of
four speakers in each year and I always
tell them the same thing you have two
ears so you need two speakers you want
to do it with software in order to get
bigger better drivers and I mean I think
yeah you're just giving me the old nod
here so why don't we move along that's
the you 320 so you're saying this is
with one cable compatible with pc xbox
and ps3 so how much does that cost
that's at a 179 95 and along with pc
xbox ps3 also mac platform as well so
with you'll have a USB connector as well
as the set of RCA analog to get your
audio out whether it be from your TV
through the audio cables of the console
gaming itself so now you have just a one
solution for all of your gaming needs
fantastic okay i just want to show one
thing about the 360 3d here so there are
a couple upgrades versus the 5 5 5 s
that would get me thinking about it so
you've got the boom mic that has a
active noise canceling on it right
active noise canceling and also an
automatic mute function when the
microphone is in the up position and
then the other thing here is you've got
volume control built right into the side
of the headset something that you don't
necessarily see on headphone products
right okay so let's move over to the
350s see now I'm more of an open
headphone guys so this this isn't so
much my cup of tea but my wife loves her
350s what does the 350s e ad that she
didn't that she doesn't already have
with this it's it's a lot of cosmetic
differences so we're improving the
structural integrity of the headset so
slightly different design and the
headband and the yoke braided cables so
better durability at the cable side and
slight improvement again we're putting
in the volume control on the ear cup
automatic muting on the mic before in
the previous generation all that was in
line on the cable so if anything were to
happen that a whole that whole part
would have to be replaced here we're
making it easier for a modular service
design so this way there's not so much
more downtime if you need any parts why
don't you do just a quick spiel on open
versus closed for the viewers here with
a closed head site you're getting more
isolation from ambient noise so if
you're in a dorm or a noisy environment
you want to keep a lot of the noise out
that's normally one you'll go with
clothes they're also a bit more
aggressive sounding so it'd be a lot
more bass basin emphasis be a little bit
boomer especially if you're doing a
first-person shooter or something along
those lines with an open air it's a much
more natural listening environment
because you're allowing the air and
acoustics to flow in and out and you're
you're you will be more aware of your
surroundings but what we find happens
with that with a natural environment
you're getting a much more transparent
much more accurate response it's much
more pleasing to our ears and the way
our brain is perceiving it when it's
done that way alright well you know what
thank you so much this has been
fantastic Scott and guys don't miss any
