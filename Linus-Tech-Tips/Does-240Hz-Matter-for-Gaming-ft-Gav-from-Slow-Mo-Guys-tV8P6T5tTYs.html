get him drinking that a couple of months
back nvidia published the data from a
study showing that gamers running on
high refresh rate monitors with faster
pcs were fragging more noobs than their
pleb counterparts who were running low
refresh rate monitors and slower
computers of course their conclusion was
everyone should buy better gear to make
them a better gamer the problem with
their study is that while they did find
a correlation between people with better
equipment and people with more skills a
correlation does not mean causation so a
lot of arguments get made about the
subject of high fps and high refresh
rate gaming and how many FPS is enough
before the I can't see a difference but
one of the key components of a faster
refresh rate display is not in fact the
smoothness of the animation and it is
smoother please don't be ignorant but
rather the frequency with which your eye
receives updated information about the
whereabouts and activities of your
enemies so today's video is all about
determining quantitatively how much
faster a gamer with a 240 Hertz display
will react versus a gamer with a more
traditional 60 Hertz display and we
invited a special guest gavin free of
slo-mo guys and roosterteeth fame is
gonna help us operate this thing to do
it I don't know how to operate this
thing thank goodness he's here I can you
back speaking of thank goodness thank
goodness for our sponsor Moss has
updated their packs once again and
they're combining the best features from
their Grande and their black pack into
their new moss pack v4 check it out
today at the link in the video
description
first we want to know if our 240 Hertz
gamer sees the enemy sooner that is to
say we want to know if the up to 12
milliseconds of extra information
actually helps him or her react faster
we also want to know on average if the
smoother animations and the more
frequent updates allow our gamer test
subject here to kill the enemy sooner or
more reliably so here's our test rig on
the right hand side we've got our enemy
or our target which is running a cs go
server on our high-speed local area
network every test needs to be run
exactly the same way so what we'll do is
position this computer's character in
this corner right here so it's in
exactly the same spot then we'll use
this readout in the top left to make
sure that our weapon is pointed at the
exact same pixel then what we do is we
take these two contacts and touch them
together which lights up an LED on our
makeymakey right here that is going to
synchronize with our high-speed camera
when exactly our target begins moving
without making any noise that will alert
our test subject so we're going to be
using the same monitor from Acer for
both our 60 Hertz and our 240 Hertz
tests since the only variable that we're
trying to isolate is the refresh rate
each of our test subjects gets to
practice runs at 60 Hertz to ensure that
they're familiar with the test then
we'll follow with three runs at 60 three
runs at 240 and then four runs two at 60
and two at 240 where the test subject
isn't told the monitor refresh rate each
time so the way that this works is once
again I'm pointing at exactly the same
spot exact pixel and then Ed without me
being able to see what he's doing
starts running at some point now let's
talk about our timing mechanism so it's
probably a little overkill but this here
is a what is this walk us through this
is the fencin flex 4k it's what I've
used for a long time on my channels
about a five-year old camera this
point there's not really any storage
media that can write so fast when you're
taking in that many images so it
requests when internal Ram buffer so
it's always recording five second buffer
and then all I do is just stop it and it
keeps the previous five seconds then we
record that onto this very fast flash
storage these are expensive sadly so the
way the camera works speed wise it has a
certain amount of throughput it can put
in and then you just find the
combination of resolution and speed that
you want so if you lower the resolution
the frame rate goes higher sure so what
are we going to be using well that's up
to you early I shoot everything at 4k
which will give us a max of a thousand
which would probably do pretty well in
these lighting conditions it's kind of
dark at 2000 and also we are relying on
the light coming from the monitors which
I was slightly concerned about but it
looks like it's not too dark okay that's
so much like we have right and then what
should or disappear is the frame because
huh this is like how a fly sees us like
that's what I always think of yeah it's
like we just look like that to fly it
just like casually fly off and flip us
off and we come nowhere close which I do
like a self slap or someone else gets
loved yet how do you want it you want to
slap me you know it has to be pretty
hard right you set up all this test just
so you could screw around with a
high-speed camera right now this is
irrelevant you just wanted the
high-speed camera to get slapped around
that's the whole reason you're here
that's why okay alright slap it
my ears ringing oh you know I missed the
trick we do that again you did not you
let you it dragged some skin with that
one look at you know we can't we get two
new staff headshot it's like everyone's
face is tough what you messed up okay
practice run time you need to have like
both hands over there so I have no
movement indication as to when you're
when you're so you want me to trigger it
even if you miss I mean when you miss I
mean if you miss that moment when you
invite someone out and they like insult
you but bonding so it takes me a good
long while to actually even start
tracking the target that's what's gonna
be interesting about this test with the
additional frames that you'll get what
was I doing what was I aiming at the car
I think this video is really about
exposing flaws in counter strikes hit
detection what did you hit there because
I didn't see any impacts and it looked
like it was right on him in your defense
thank you so what we learned from our
first run is that the experiment looks
good but we're gonna do a remedial test
here with the walking speed of our
target slowed down from 322 to 20 but we
also want to try a remedial run here
with the walking speed of our target at
220
to see if that increases our subject
chances of killing the target so let's
try it one more time here okay that's
definitely easier one of the
measurements I'm really looking for here
is time to kill because you're still
gonna clearly be faster to kill the
target it's just a matter of like wow I
really left this to the last moment here
Oh what did I hit did you have a metal
skull what was that
I probably a helmet not a metal school I
think a thousand is doing it for you I
think so we're cuz that's one
millisecond there's nothing like anyone
even advertises as lower than one
millisecond and I think that's
considered well beyond the ability of a
human to perceive anyway it also makes
the math really easy yeah that's
actually the biggest factor thank you so
much again by the way for like being
here this is oh I loved it okay good cuz
your your insight here has actually been
instrumental already to us just kind of
understanding what we're doing yeah this
is this is super fun for me Rock Paper
Scissors for who has to go first do you
the kind of person you'd like to say it
as you do it when you just rock paper
and then you go right you go on paper no
no on scissors okay ah
trusty wrong alright okay so I'm first
one thing that's really important is
that Edie is gonna mix up his timing for
when he starts the test so I can't
predict when the target is gonna start
moving okay I am officially ready me to
shoot but not hit a
oh my god how did I miss that if it
makes you feel any better
this is 84 seconds of unison do you find
that when you're in deep concentration
and you're waiting for it to happen I'm
do you find that you should start
overthinking when it's gonna happen and
then you might miss it cause you're
thinking too much
absolutely oh shit did you just fall out
of the zone right there at the end I
don't know what happened to the eye that
seemed to be the longest it took you to
catch up with them interesting we are
now up to four hundred and sixty-six
gigs
Wow okay that's certainly like less than
twenty seconds
gotcha okay Oh
headshot shoot hit him
hey are you ready wait for it
now I'm ready you got a piece of them
not bad
feel like I'm improving see I'm happy
with my reaction time
my aim is anus it was very tight anus
not bad
wait a minute what just happened I
pressed play and oh my god I am so sorry
my best attempt and he deleted it can I
feel like we should go until he gets a
really good one yeah the 60 just don't
do it for me
Wow
good that's it more last minute no I
don't think so I even see the body oh
that was clean that might be my fastest
one yet yeah mate make sure you save
that one yeah yeah I got you fam we like
that one
I am ready as penis that count
I'm just got wet I went way ahead of him
that time so your reaction was fast but
not accurate I was trying to go for like
a wicked snap shot that I don't have
that ability I'm literally the most
experienced I could possibly be and that
was my worst attempt this is so
interesting oh oh wait do you want to do
some practice runs or have you already
tried it a lot of times Wow mr.
confident over here I think that was
actually back and forth like I see at
least five tears when I play yeah I
think we can call out of wait so you
want me to not to save that one yeah I
don't bother
all right everyone go home guys that was
it already moving before he's even fully
come out that's by far the fastest
reaction we've seen boom headshot as the
kids say I suppose the kids 15 years Oh
boohoo
whatever
not bad did you hit me yeah felt like it
okay last chance
wow I wasn't good what are you doing
that was a headlight so it has been
quite a few hours the time is now 1141
and we're all still at it especially edy
who has been painstakingly compiling the
data and is now sharing it with us so
your average for 60 Hertz is 257 yeah is
that in frames yes but that's 257
milliseconds effectively okay and then
194 for 240 Hertz so that doesn't even
make sense how you could be that much
faster because theoretically you should
only have that best a 12 millisecond
advantage interesting so I am the
slowest by a long shot
oh you're up in the 300 sometimes yeah
that's an eternity now could be that you
waited to see the person quite a bit
more and then I guess so now you were
the most consistent consistently average
I feel like whenever I saw anything I
would just kind of spasm my hand away
and try and just catch up with it later
but I think that's just down to me is
just not being very good maybe it was
more of a focus thing yeah
audience this was actually previously
passed 854 milliseconds and when you
consider that I had a 360 millisecond
reaction time it actually only took me
half a second to kill the target once I
started moving that's really good
actually not as good a second and a half
overall and kill wise you're the same
look it is fake humility hey I feel like
there's so many more variables that
aren't measured here like how in the
zone we were like what the the other
person is psyching us out as I must this
is the pressure building up I feel like
on my last attempt I was always freaking
out way more than my previous ones yeah
actually that's another thing too like
if I missed one I was like tense on my
next one
I gotta make up for for a bad one if I
only concentrated on being ready for the
guys to come around the corner and I was
all I was thinking about I could only do
that for like four seconds until I was
thinking about doing that and it would
just wreck my concentration I mean
obviously we're watching this in slow
motion so it's very exaggerated but this
makes me wonder how I ever played
anything at 30 frames a second and I
regularly do like if I'm playing GTA 5
on xbox that's running 30 this may have
ruined me even more for refresh rates
and frame rates
alright so GAD flew home last night but
for giggles we spent some more time
analyzing the data and found some really
cool things one everyone's reaction
times were better at 240 Hertz and
strangely by more than just 12
milliseconds if I had to guess I'd say
part of this is because it's easier to
track where the target is headed and
then decide where to move the cursor
before you begin to move to every single
test subject was more likely to kill the
opponent at 240 Hertz in the limited
amount of time that they had and
three the way that high refresh rate
affects your gaming could end up being
heavily dependent on the way that you
aim so take a look at this map of all of
my shots my accuracy and my precision
were both actually very similar at 60
versus 240 Hertz so regardless of
refresh rate I'm taking my time tracking
the target and only pulling the trigger
when I think I've got a clean shot and
it's funny it's not something I've ever
thought about would it make sense now
that I'm looking at it because I'm
totally one of those jackasses that
grabs the sniper class so everyone else
has to play medic or whatever so for me
revealing my position is always a factor
in the back of my mind
don't pull the trigger unless I think
I'm gonna hit something all right now
let's look at Ed's 'el Ed's more of like
a flick shot kind of player so he tends
to react and shoot first and figure out
the other details later
now as the most skilled of our test
subjects she clearly benefited the most
from high refresh rate and said that it
helped him time the release of his shot
much better as he panned across his
target
finally there's gap in fairness to gap
no one really aims only with their mouse
like it's much easier to strength while
you're trying to line up a shot like
this but his results were still far and
away the worst at both refresh rates if
that said at 240 Hertz his precision was
much higher so if he was a little closer
to the target the improvement in his
consistency would have definitely
resulted in more kills
so in conclusion yes high refresh rate
gaming makes a difference it's the kind
of thing we've always felt but it was
never something that we've quantified
now I think there's still a lot more
work to do investigating this may be
part two could involve different mouse
sensitivity settings some professional
players I don't know hit us up in the
comments if you've got some ideas but
for now we feel like this is a pretty
good place to leave it
and we've definitely
something speaking of learning something
I want to teach you about our sponsor
ring wants you to know who is at your
front door without ever getting off the
couch their welcome kit includes the
video doorbell to their spotlight cam
battery and there's solar security sign
and their video doorbell too has tons of
great features it's got a motion sensor
camera 1080p HD resolution with 160
degrees of vision two-way audio and it's
powered by a battery or eight to 24 volt
AC doorbell wiring their spotlight
camera has 1080p HD video two-way talk
LED lights battery or solar power
sources and a siren the audio is great
as well and you can turn away unwelcome
guests or tell them to come right in
just because someone's an unwelcome
guest doesn't mean that they can't come
into your house like say for example
your mother-in-law hey I've used that
joke before but that's okay it's still
funny my personal favorite is telling
the Amazon driver not to run away after
the second knock of the door like now I
don't want the notice I want the actual
product now so get some peace of mind
with the ring welcome kit it's
compatible with iOS Android Mac and
Windows and you can buy it today at the
link in the video description so thanks
