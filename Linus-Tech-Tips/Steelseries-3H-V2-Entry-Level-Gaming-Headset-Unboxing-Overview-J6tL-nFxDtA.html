for more details welcome to my unboxing
an overview of the SteelSeries 3h v2
gaming headset now I normally don't
really talk about prices in my videos
but I should mention that this one is
$39.99 so it's around 40 bucks so adjust
your expectations if you're expecting
this to be the most like cinematic
sounding like awesomest audiophile pair
of headphones ever in the world then
sort of think again but what it is it is
is it is what I'd consider kind of like
um I don't know what I call it without
it sounding sort of condescending but
like like baby's first gaming headphones
so if you've never used a proper pair of
gaming headphones and you're not used to
the features that you might find on a
pair of gaming headphones this will be a
darn sight better than most else that
you'll find in this kind of a price
range the other thing that I'd consider
it perfect for is as like a secondary
pair of headphones that you use for
traveling because it folds up extremely
tight and it's the kind of thing where
because of its flexibility you wouldn't
worry too much about breaking it and
because of its price you wouldn't worry
too much about breaking it so there's
both of those things going for it it
also has a fair bit of flexibility in
terms of the connectors that are
included this is something SteelSeries
has started doing over the last little
while here but I actually really like so
they include an adapter you've either
you can either plug directly into your
PC so it's got a nice feels actually
quite good orange rubber coated cord AB
should be quite anti tangle as well and
then they've actually got two little
pieces here that plug in so they've got
little labels on them there's the
corresponding headphone thing so you put
those together and then the microphone
symbols together and boom you've adapted
it to a four pole so you can use it with
your mobile device or with your computer
which i think is quite neat it has
inline volume control as well as an
inline mic mute is very clearly labeled
so mic off ya mic on just like that
volume up and down just like that it's a
little bit on the bulkier side but I
guess you expect that with the more cost
effective as
to say options like the three hv2 and
then the headphones themselves are quite
lightweight quite small so if you wear
an XL size motorcycle helmet for example
you might not find these are quite
optimal for you and you can tell that
they're going to sit on your ears a
little bit as opposed to completely
around your ears because the ear cups
are a little bit on the smaller side as
well just like their Siberia series
you've got sort of a couple you've got
like a support brace and then you've got
a separate piece of padding that has got
kind of a plethora material on it just
like that and then the ear cups
themselves also have like a synthetic
leather material feeling stuff on it
it's better than some of the synthetic
leather I've encountered that has a very
plasticky feel but it's certainly not
quite the real deal so let's go ahead
and put them on oh this is unusual
left side is here so the cable actually
comes out of the right side that's a
little bit a little bit different I
haven't often seen that in the past so
they're adjustable like this go ahead
and adjust them as needed like I said
they're not huge so I actually have them
adjusted to the max in order to have
them maybe not quite max maybe I'll go
one click down and it's not the best
adjustment mechanism that I've ever
encountered but again this is a fairly
low-cost pair of headphones let's go
ahead and yeah I think we got it now
there we go so it's it's on years like
that there's actually a fair bit of
passive noise cancellation or passive
noise blocking noise isolation that's
the word I'm looking for from these
headphones and part of that is due to
the use of the synthetic leather
material as opposed to a more open mesh
type of material this is the feature
that is going to be the sort of Rock'em
Sock'em you didn't see this one coming
one and that's the retractable
microphone right here
so most headsets in this kind of a price
range aren't going to have features like
that they'll either have like an inline
mic that's attached to sort of like a
thing down here or they'll have like
kind of an awkward boom mic or something
that's detachable that you can lose I
really love the retractable microphone
thing is one of the things that I've
always liked about SteelSeries headsets
and now they've brought that feature
down to the 3hv too you can adjust it
wherever you need to with its nice
little flexible snake cord it doesn't
feel as good as the one on my 7h
obviously but it should be quite
functional for you you can just tuck it
back away like that
I think that's pretty much it um I hope
I'm not must be talking really really
loud right now it actually does isolate
noise ah quite well so in terms of cable
length you should be able to reach
around to the back of your computer give
your computer you'll reach around you
know what I mean but not not not that
long so I would probably sort of mostly
aim to plug this into the front of your
computer but in a pinch if you keep your
tower on the right it might be able to
make it back there so I think that
pretty much wraps it up thank you for
checking out my unboxing and overview of
the SteelSeries
3h v2 gaming headset don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips for more
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos and I guess I did miss one thing
if you really do have trouble with that
and they've included this guide for how
to plug these things in as far as
documentation goes I don't know I don't
know if that's the most impressive I've
ever seen but yeah it's all good it
shouldn't need documentation for that
anyway I don't forget to like the video
if you liked it don't forget to dislike
it if you disliked it leave me a comment
let me know where do you think the
target market is for this would you
recommend this to someone more as like a
secondary pair of headphones or would
you recommend this to someone as like I
said sort of their their their first
gaming headset</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
