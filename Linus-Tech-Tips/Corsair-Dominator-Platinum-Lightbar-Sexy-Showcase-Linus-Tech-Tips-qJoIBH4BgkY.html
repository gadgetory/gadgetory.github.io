unboxing is not about the box because
you can plainly see that there's no
books this is about what's inside the
box
this is Corsairs all-new dominator light
bar showcase so inside this anti-static
bag I have four sticks of what is some
of the most premium memory on the
freakin block so the light bar kit comes
with a few different colors but ours is
going to be showcasing the blue light
bar so I'm going to move that so that
I'm not showing it to the wrong camera
here so you can see that there's a well
the light inside the dominator platinum
module is still white but there's an
actual blue window in the top of it
that's going to give it some pretty
sweet effects so remember guys dominator
Platinum's use a custom PCB a custom
heat spreader
they've got heatsink fins here on the
top and then an aluminum bar that goes
on the top both for looks and for
presumably some additional cooling
although I don't think that's going to
make that much of a difference but also
just like awesome looking this you've
also got full compatibility with course
our link with the little connector on
the side of the module itself which sort
of drives home that custom PCB acts
aspect of this guys to be clear these
are extremely expensive heat spreaders
and only really make sense for premium
modules so we're going to go ahead and
we're going to take our existing sort of
gaming memory I guess you might call it
take it out of this system
and we are going to be operating two
corsair dominator platinum so you can
see that before I started I touch the
power supply that's to ground myself and
now I'm not going to move my feet it's
important to do the necessary
precautions for installing memory like
this so this all right let's back on
this here diesel I'm going to get you to
come in close again so these are 16 gig
kits so these are two by eights and then
I'm populating them into a quad channel
board which is technically not really
recommended but it should still be fine
2400 megahertz so 2.4 gigahertz 8 gig
modules
need a moment of silence to let that
like sink in then poom head explosion so
they're cast tents oh yeah they're not
super tight timings or anything by any
stretch of the imagination but that is
some high speed high density memory
going on that means we are putting 32
gigs of some of the fastest RAM money
can buy in this particular system here
it also happens to be some of the
sexiest RAM than you can buy so let's go
ahead and power this bad boy up so I'm
going to put my power cable back in
every so often the motherboard will just
power up if you insert a memory module
so that's why I unplugged the power
supply or actually unplugging it's bad
you should leave it plugged in so that
you can still ground off of it but you
should turn the switch so that the
system will randomly power on all right
so here we go we'll do a daytime shot
first and power this up whoa love it
this goes really well with the t9 x 79
deluxe motherboard that we've got in
this particular rig this is an older
coarser h100 not an age 100 I I
apologize for that but it still looks
pretty boss how's that how's that look
diesel should we do the night shot now
yeah I'm getting the I'm getting the so
so pin so let's do our night shot here
ready guys let's try trimming boy just
those off first and see how it looks
go how's that look I'm getting the
thumbs up how about in complete darkness
how's it look now yeah I'm definitely
getting the thumbs up over there now so
that is what Dominator light bars will
look like in your system I'm going to
give you some different angles here guys
so you can still see the whiteness as
kind of an under glow effect but the
tops of the modules themselves I'm going
to lean a little bit more so you can see
the very tops of the modules have a very
unique whoops oh hold on let's power
back on I think oh shoot I think I put
something there we go and put some
pressure on the connector there alright
so the tops of the modules themselves
have that blue glow going on which looks
very very cool so I'm going to go ahead
and go all the way down to this angle so
you can see it from here you got that
bezel alright so there you go guys
that is the corsair
dominator Platinum's with light bars it
was sort of an unboxing basically beasts
memory for beasts systems don't forget
