the 46 inch version from that particular
line of product so this is still a smart
TV so it does have all those Smart TV
features so Samsung sort of so with some
of the selling points or ones that I
might not find useful but somebody
probably does you can watch like a yoga
video and yoga in front of your TV you
can get the you can get the camera
accessory and you can Skype on your
Smart TV it's got an internet browser
and this one actually browser but also a
full QWERTY keypad remote control so
I'll show you guys that once it's done
once it's opened up here so that's
Kennedy that means you can watch your
Netflix or YouTube or whatever you can
search for content using a keyboard
instead of trying to input it in a way
that is a little bit less intuitive it
less quick so we've got our here and
then inside we find some way there we've
also got our face which is the metal
style base that we saw on the 8000
series but what makes this a 7000 series
versus an 8000 series is a couple things
so number one it doesn't have the metal
one design bezel so the one does I
actually here come pick up the one
design bezel so the one design bezel is
basically this super ultra thin bezel
and instead of a 960 clear motion rate
this one has 720 thermonuclear motion
rate doesn't necessarily refer to the
speed of the LCD panel itself the
frequency of it but it is a combination
of that and the modulation of the
backlight
and the processing that goes on in the
TV that achieves that sort of what
Samsung say is the perceived so I'm just
gonna go ahead and pop this here we'll
have a look at the accessories that are
included so we've got a power adapter
we've got a composite adapter we've got
these are reinforcers with a base amount
we've got components and then I do want
to check out aside from the four
triple-a batteries that come with it in
order to power it I do want to check out
this remote here for those back in there
so this is their full QWERTY remote
gives you access to all those cool
features go ahead you got a pair of this
with your TV instructions on there just
pull that off there we go so you got a
little screen here so you can see what
you're typing and you've got a number
pad these are your programmable buttons
those exist on both sides of the remote
as well as your full QWERTY keyboard
including special characters which is
neat and navigation buttons which is
also neat so you can get around in the
menu and all that good stuff and then
here you find the buttons that you're
typically used to seeing on a TV you
know your source your on/off all that
good stuff all right so let's go ahead
and undo so this is a lot less
challenging to
like it because it is significantly
smaller so I'm able to handle handle it
a little bit better so give me a minute
here guys and I will put it on the stand
so we can show you it so this is a 3d TV
which I'm not sure if I already
mentioned or not and it also includes
Samsung Sunita 3d conversion so that
means that you can actually on the fly
can actually hate to check this out go
from this side to this side this changes
from a 3d to an M I don't know if you'll
be able to see it on camera though it's
kind of neat this hologram okay so that
means that you've got there 2d to 3d
conversion technology which allows you
to take any content whether it's TV or
games or whatever else the case may be
and you can convert them on the fly to
3d and the effect is actually really
good we've already seen it on their LCD
monitor like their PC monitor so it's
pretty much the same kind of idea is
also included on this TV so if that
means is deeper blacks and brighter
whites higher contrast ratio overall and
I've talked about the Smart TV features
this house you know what let's go have a
look at all the inputs and outputs and
then yeah okay okay fine fine we'll talk
about that now cameraman spending a lot
of time looking at the bezel oh this one
because both he and I actually really
like it so you can see here there's only
about shoot okay whatever this much so
between here and here of actual opaque
bezel and then outside of that is a
clear bezel so the difference between
the 7000 series
and then the 8000 series we look at four
this one the one design bezel is metal
personally when standing in front of the
display like this I actually find that
the clear bezel makes it look smaller
than the metal bezel though so I
actually really like the way the 7000
series TV looks okay so come on over
here infants no buts it's all pretty
standard on these high-end TVs so we're
probably gonna have 4 HDMIs which we do
three USB including one that supports a
hard drive we've also got digital
optical audio out moving down we've got
component in we've got composite in vga
in antenna in audio the X link and LAN
although you don't necessarily need the
LAN connector I believe this one has
built-in Wi-Fi that cameraman is giving
me the knobs so all of the high-end ones
I believe it's 7000 series and up have
built-in Wi-Fi whereas the other ones
are available with samsung Wi-Fi adapter
doohickey you can put that in there and
use that with one of the USB ports so I
think that pretty much covers everything
I wanted to say I'd say that that both
sort of around the 7000 series range is
where you start getting sort of more
more bang for your buck the thousand
series is very expensive it does have
the benefit of being super super thin
you've got the metal battle's bezel
design versus the plastic bezel design
which is sort of a personal taste
whether you prefer it or not 9000 series
is very expensive but when you go down
to the 6000 series you start to lose
some of the features so
7000 series looks pretty darn good to me
and I wish I had one but I don't
thank you for checking out this video
and don't forget to subscribe to Linus
tech tips from our boxing's reviews
another computer videos oh and since
this is the last one we're doing today
anyway let's do like just a quick tour
of the new Samsung showcase storefronts
annex you've got this little wooden
panel roof thing going on here and I got
what says Samsung logo so AllShare right
that's that's a smart TV so it has all
share so if you got a Samsung tablet or
smartphone or whatever else you can just
browse through your pictures on your
device and then you can see them on your
TV little Samsung 3d logo so this is
where the 3d plasma is gonna go and I
think that gives you sort of a pretty
good feel for what this place is going
to look like it'll be open in a couple
weeks so I hope to see you there don't
