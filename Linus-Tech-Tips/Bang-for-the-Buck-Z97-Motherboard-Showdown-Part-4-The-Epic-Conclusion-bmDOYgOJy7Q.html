installment of the 100 ish dollar z97
motherboard showdown as you probably
know by now
we've been in venturing into the world
of affordable motherboards instead of
top-tier motherboards which are
expensive and don't really impact
performance anyways we're doing this
because we want to explore the pros cons
and trade-offs of boards that people are
actually buying in this video we'll be
covering the finished system experience
of each board things like OneTouch
overclocking utilities and the final
conclusion will be covered in this video
don't forget to stay subscribed for less
videos on affordable motherboards in the
future since apparently you guys aren't
that into them anyways experienced
silent performance with the new cooler
master Silencio 652 s minimalist design
maximum compatibility click now to learn
more well start off with the fun stuff
generally all of the board's various
overclocking utilities resulted in a 4.4
gigahertz overclock for the Intel G 32
58 CPU and XMP settings for the g.skill
ripjaws 24 hundreds except for the
asrock board which simply had a
selectable profile on the asrock board
the 4.7 gigahertz profile failed 4.6
gigahertz seems stable enough but it
wasn't really fair as I had to manually
verify the stability anyways which kind
of defeats the purpose of OneTouch
overclocking next up we have the driver
downloading experience something that
might not seem that important in the
grand scheme of things but we measured
it so MSI comes in first at 7.7
megabytes per second on average with a
soos as a closer honor up at around 6
point 6 megabytes per second gigabyte
trails behind at 2.1 megabytes per
second lining it in third place and last
then in this case least is as rock at
1.3 megabytes per second please keep in
mind that while we tested all these one
right after the other we were unsure of
how loaded these companies networks were
at the time of testing and we downloaded
all these files to our office in Western
Canada so your results will vary so with
all those megabytes per second what did
I download well naturally all the
drivers some would expect and some
utility software as well something you
may know if you've proves the software
utility section of
other boards downloads before is that
there are tons of them and honestly you
shouldn't download most of them but
whatever you do no matter how many you
download avoid network utilities like
the plague Windows is actually totally
fine at handling this on its own and
doesn't need additional bloatware to do
it instead unless you really need
prioritization for some reason and don't
have that feature on your router where
it belongs if you do want to download
any utilities you could go for their
overclocking fan speed or monitoring
software I suggest you use these largely
just for monitoring however and use your
UEFI for actually setting things up if
you're looking for information on UEFI
check out our last video here and also
please note that if you do want to
overclock in your operating system that
you will need the Intel management
engine driver installed so it's time for
the final conclusion obviously if you're
looking into buying a motherboard I
would suggest watching all of the other
videos in this series but as a quick
overview let's look into what really
matters
first and foremost IO matters make sure
that you're going to be able to plug in
all the peripherals and drives into the
board that you will need most of these
boards will have you covered but it is
still an important question to ask
yourself then we have PCI layout same
type of question make sure you can hook
up everything that you need to and not
have any conflicts in terms of
positioning another thing to note is the
comparison of fan headers on your board
and fan slots that you'll be filling in
your case make sure there's enough and
make sure that they are in the right
spot and general case compatibility is
important as well if you're 24 pin
connector cable management holes don't
line up with the location on the board
you're going to have a bad time now
thanks to Intel moving so many things
onto their CPUs there is very little
difference between boards when it comes
to performance and overclocking so this
shouldn't be that huge of a factor when
looking into bores especially in this
price range but looking into things like
if it's running a dual BIOS and or a
socketed BIOS setup might not be a bad
idea and choosing a board with a good
software layout for all these by OC
dials and switches will help a lot
overall the motherboard landscape
especially in this bracket
is pretty level there is much less of a
difference between boards now than there
has been in previous years which is
great news for folks looking to save a
few extra bucks so then what's the best
for you
a soos was a clear winner in UEFI and
overall usability experience but asrock
has a ton of fan headers compared to
everyone else and was rocking loads of
other features like SLI MSI has great
compatibility like a soos but a few more
physical features then a soos while
still having nice things like rich fan
control gigabyte had a great aesthetic
style and a great dual BIOS
implementation to keep you going along
with a variety of other features who do
you think won let me know in the
comments down below or better yet on the
forum speaking of winning if you love
watching anime you should check out
crunchy roll with crunchy roll premium

of their service absolutely free so be
sure to check them out in the link in
the video description alright guys
thanks for hanging with me through this
series don't forget to comment down
below or on the forum of which board you
think range supreme of their socket
cuisine I don't know
anyways while you're down below here
commenting be sure to subscribe if you
haven't already like the video dislike
the video depending on which color board
you like more share it if you think it's
helpful for someone who might be
building a computer soon and over on the
forum you can become a contributor
because there will be reason to do that
fairly soon and in the video description
below this video you can check out a
shirt link and over on the forum if you
like bouncing back and forth repeatedly
you can see a like help Linus media
group link where you can change stuff
like Amazon links to help us get
kickback kickbacks whenever you buy
anything on Amazon thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
