review we decided that it didn't really
matter which graphics card we configured
it with if we were willing to upgrade
later using Thunderbolt 3 which then got
us thinking this is after the review you
know the MacBook Pro has Thunderbolt 3
ports too which means that for better
for worse both of these machines
actually have similar upgrade paths so
maybe by evaluating the iMac solely as a
desktop we missed out on another viable
option I mean if you're giving up a lot
of the traditional benefits of a desktop
anyway given that both of these are
running high-end core i9 processors are
you better off with an iMac or a macbook
well there's only one way for us to find
out by sitting through this belabored
segue to the message from our sponsor
glass wire with glass wire you can
instantly see your current and past
network activity detect malware and
block badly behaving apps on your PC or
Android device use offer code Linus to
get 25% off glass wire at the link below
so the first thing we'll need to give
little Mack here a fighting chance
against King Hippo is a graphics card
now unfortunately NVIDIA is still in
talks with Apple to get official GeForce
support under Mac OS but it's not all
bad news the Radeon 7 which we're gonna
connect up via a razor core v2 enclosure
is still significantly more powerful
than the top end GPU configurations for
either of these machines and armed with
the beta of Apple's Mac OS moment and
14.5 we and by we I of course mean
Anthony should be able to get it working
now while Anthony is setting that up I
want to answer the burning question that
I'm sure is on everyone's mind right now
these two computers here are
fundamentally very very different so why
compare them at all and that is a good
point except for a few things
one is that they're both actually aimed
at a really similar market segment
namely graphics artists and
professionals thanks to their high
resolution wide gamut dcpip 3 displays
number 2 in both cases our bang for the
buck recommended config includes a
dedicated AMD GPU a radio on pro 560 ex
in the case of the MacBook and a Radeon
Pro 580 X in our iMac finally number 3
they both suffer from thermal
constraints that affect their peak
performance in ways that you can't
easily read off of a spec sheet so what
we want to know then is if they have
similar purposes and design goals well
which one of them should we choose a
MacBook Pro with some upgrades and I
don't know maybe a secondary display or
something like that or an iMac which is
running faster dedicated graphics and of
course a larger monitor in the first
place furthermore how did the costs pan
out and is the mobile processor
bottleneck going to cause real
performance problems for professional
work
so what do you think well I think for
compute we're probably looking at a much
faster experience with the MacBook Pro
just as a result of the much faster
Radeon seven the imac has two more much
faster cores so depending on how they
thermal throttle it might be a wash or
it might be a win for either of them
really before we do that though we're
gonna do a quick Cinebench run to get a
baseline for the cpu performance it's
worth noting too though that our iMac
isn't equipped with the fastest GPU that
it could have had the thing though is
that paying for that upgrade to Vega 56
or something yeah I think I pro 56 yeah
paying for that upgrade would have
gotten us half of the way to a much
faster external Radeon 7ne way so we
just didn't think it made sense so I'm
looking at somewhere in the 4100 range
and whoof yeah 2340 on the MacBook Pro
okay so as expected more cores is more
better in a heavily multi-threaded
workload and furthermore our MacBook Pro
thermal throttled considerably harder
than our iMac which widened even our
anticipated performance difference but
of note is the fact that a single
threaded score between these two
machines isn't that far off and often
your single threaded performance is more
important for light tasks like web
browsing application launching and
generally use yeah on that subject
actually I also ran black magics disk
speed benchmark and while it's not a
great test since it only looks at
sequential speeds it appears that Apple
is using a similar class of SSD on both
of these machines which probably
contributes to the fact that I didn't
really notice any chugging between them
that being said the iMac is equipped
with a fusion drive which is spitting
rust along with the SSD meaning that
after a certain period of time the
caching stops and it becomes slow and
that's kind of the thing about Mac OS
isn't it for all its shortcomings it's
really well optimized and
most need a heavy load in order to tell
the difference between one decently
equipped Mac and another so with that in
mind we're gonna go full opposite end of
the spectrum and hit our machines with
lux mark a GPU dependent 3d rendering
benchmark and this is where things get
really interesting so right out of the
box with no upgrades to either machine
there is a clear performance advantage
for our desktop I mean we're talking
double the horses here and $400 cheaper
but that's not to say that if you ran
out and buy yourself a MacBook Pro you
are plumb out of luck if you can afford
the graphics card upgrade it can inject
a lot of fight into your portable
machine so with the Radeon seven in tow
our core i9 equipped model managed
anywhere from three to even four times
the performance of our all-in-one
desktop it's worth noting though when
our iMac is similarly kitted out with
the Radeon seven it actually does a much
better job of combining the power of
both the onboard and external graphics
which allows it to keep the performance
advantage I'll be it a much smaller one
next let's take a look at video editing
Adobe Premiere whether it's related to
the external nature of our graphics card
or the beta version of Mac OS that we're
running didn't actually benefit from our
Radeon 7gp you upgrade so we had to pull
it off which means that we're looking at
a twenty to twenty-five percent
performance difference in export times
with what I would describe as pretty
darn similar on timeline scrubbing
performance and this is with pretty
heavy footage but I think you can go a
little bit worse this is only twenty to
one footage if I recall correctly is
that right Brendan yeah
as for Final Cut let's go ahead and fire
that up this is a tricky one to
benchmark because Apple has a really
cool feature that pretty much renders
your video ahead of time in the
background while you are cutting it
together and this avoids the traditional
long way
times while your finished project
exports what we can do though is we can
cancel delete our rendering cache and
then start off the rendering process
manually as well as look at our timeline
performance while doing the render cuz
I've attached for looks to each of these
yeah so it should be pretty so yeah it's
it's smooth it's nothing over I'm
getting really quick previews what's
yours like I don't think I'm actually
faster than you that actually does look
a touch faster but I've got the fusion
drive and these are large files that's
true so that could be affecting me
they're interesting also interesting
when we actually did benchmark our
renders we found that the iMac was about
twice as fast as the MacBook Pro even
with the external GPU so this seems to
be pretty much purely dependent on
multi-threaded CPU performance finally
one more heavy thing that Macs are used
to are pretty often these days is for
programming work so I've taken the
liberty of downloading the Mozilla
Firefox source code onto both of these
machines so we can put them head-to-head
and see just how much of a practical
difference those two extra cores on the
iMac can make one thing that I had
wanted to do was gather results on
Windows for both machines but getting an
external GPU running under my hobby's
boot camp requires a quite a bit of
extra setup and I'm not even sure if
it'll work at all with at2 enabled Mac
like our MacBook Pro right so there's no
t2 in the new Mac yeah so that's a point
in the I max favor in my opinion you
lose the hardware encryption and secure
Enclave features that Apple touts as
benefits but you gain the ability to run
Linux and you stand a much better chance
of recovering your data in the event of
a hard drive or a logic board failure
it's kind of important when your machine
is constantly overheating so since we've
actually run this before and this is
just movie magic I guess we've got
enough data to draw our conclusion then
add a price difference of about $400
between our core i9 equipped MacBook Pro
over here and our eight core iMac 2019
it's clear you are definitely paying a
mobility tax with the laptop you get two
fewer and overall much slower course
you're getting a weaker include
GPU and obviously you're getting a
smaller display furthermore if you were
gonna buy the external GPU anyway the
extra spend of about $1,000 for a Radeon
seven plus an enclosure is less likely
to be bottlenecked by the more powerful
CPU in the iMac and at this time anyway
it also happens to team up more
cooperatively with the graphics cores it
already has but and it's a big but the
iMac isn't portable and if you need
something that is then from our testing
you're actually still getting a lot of
bang with our tricked-out macbook pro so
if you need a laptop anyway then
compared to the prospect of buying a
laptop and an additional desktop an
external GPU upgrade looks like a great
way to close the gap since it's a lot
cheaper than even the entry-level iMac
by the way guys just one last note we
did it but to be clear we're not
actually recommending running beta
versions of your operating system on a
machine that you use for professional
apps those crashes are going to get you
when you least expect it and for Anthony
this video was quite a lot of hassle to
get done what's not a lot of hassle
