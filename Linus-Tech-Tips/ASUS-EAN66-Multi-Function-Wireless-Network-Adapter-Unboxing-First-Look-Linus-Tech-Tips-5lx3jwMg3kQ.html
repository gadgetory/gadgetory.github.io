versatile networking adapter from a soos
and an impenetrable box okay we'll
figure though that's why I have my
trusty D box of fighting knife I'm gonna
stop calling them unboxings and I'm
gonna call them D box of Fighting's it
won't be as good of a search keyword but
I think you guys will sort of you know
support me on this so here's all the
stuff that's included a bunch of stuff
in there bunch of boxes here it's like a
pyramid it goes like that
it's like this power thing and then
there's like a crotch shot which switch
is apparently going for here and no I'm
just kidding you weren't going for the
stock shot if you were you just
succeeded and I'm not saying it would
have been a bad thing okay so what is
special about this three different
functions one it can act as a network
adapter so the way you'll do that is you
go okay I need wireless networking you
know we're gonna do like real world
examples of this as we go so I need a
wireless adapter so I'm gonna like plug
this Ethernet cable in and then I'm
gonna like oh yeah
plug it in a little bit better than that
so it doesn't fall out there we go and
I'll plug in the power and then what you
do is you pair it with your router using
WPS and then you plug it in via ethernet
to something that you need to have
wireless network connectivity boom
Ethernet our wireless network adapter
okay functionality number two is as a
range extender so if you want to use it
as a range extender I'm sure there's
some kind of configuration you'll need
to do it's there's a QuickStart guide so
you know what we're not gonna get too
far into that you follow the
instructions and then you won't need an
Ethernet adapter probably once you
finish the setup but you just take the
power and the pyramid you go wherever it
is you need a wireless range extender
don't forget guys don't place a wireless
range extender on the very outside of
your wireless range like it
if this is your wireless router right
here and it's got a range of bits you
put your range extender oh whatever
don't worry about it you put your range
extender here as opposed to like right
at the edge where it won't get a very
good signal that makes sense because
that way it has a good signal to the
router and then it can extend the range
from there okay functionality number
three is if you have an existing router
that doesn't have a very good wireless
access point you can use this as an
access point so you can add wireless
functionality to a router that doesn't
have it just by plugging this in via one
of the switch ports on the router and
you're done so maybe this is the kind of
thing that you're looking at going okay
well I don't need one of these at all oh
it's duel bad 450 megabit per second
just so you guys know what's part let's
say maybe you're looking at it going
well I don't need one of those right now
but if I ever did need wireless anything
this is probably the handiest way to
augment my network in whatever way I
could possibly need so these are
extremely popular now that I've said
what I want to say about it let's have a
look at what a seuss things so patented
three point orthogonal antenna and high
power amplifier for hand signal strength
cool
easy user interface ultra-fast gdb that
all needs so it has Gigabit Ethernet so
you can actually take advantage of that
for 50 megabit per second fast wireless
network strong 2.4 dual-band ok WPS
one-button setup cool cool Gigabit
Ethernet port powerful said oK we've
covered this already and onto the back
so they've got a high Universal range
extender access point and Ethernet
adapter so very very very cool patented
antenna design for best signal 5
gigahertz signal for liquid okay so this
is a lot of repetition on this box here
but I think we've pretty much covered it
so thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the EAN 66 from Asus don't
