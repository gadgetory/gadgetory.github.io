me to unbox this is the g1 gorilla so
we've already done the assassin and the
sniper this is the most value oriented
of the g1 series boards although they're
not really value boards these are
performance gaming boards but this is
the least expensive of the lot of them
and let's get started it comes with a
three-year warranty in the US and Canada
it supports Intel Core i7 processors on
LGA 1366 so that is nine 20s 939 40s 950
s9 60s nine 70s 980 X's and 990 X's yes
that includes Extreme Edition ok it has
the intellect 58 chipset it includes an
x5 built on sound card as well as a
killer 2100 gaming networking card so
those are pretty good values considering
the fact that you do not have to now buy
and add a network card or in theory and
add in sound card because the add in
sound card not only has an x5 processor
but also a built in front audio
headphone amp which is pretty sweet as
well as high-end audio capacitors so
this is pretty important because I've
always been a huge advocate of better
onboard features such as say for example
sound and networking and it's good to
see somebody moving in that direction
alright so we got the big foot networks
killer game networking platform we have
a front access control panel let's see
say two three six gigabit per second USB
3 locked and loaded heat pipe design
which we'll have a closer look at later
five smartband connectors which can be
easily controlled with the easy tune 6
software it includes ultra-durable 3
maximum CPU power and now there we go
dual BIOS with 3 + terabyte hard drive
support a super sight what's a super
site with multiple GPU delivers maximum
FPS allowing gamers to see more clearly
and faster and move more quickly ok ok
basically they're just saying it has
support for up to 3 Way SLI and the
3-way crossfire X that's what they mean
by super
all right so when we open up the box we
find some digicam and put the box are
there so it can pose there and look
sweet and then we'll pull out the g1
gorilla itself okay see after all this I
was expecting an ape themed board
no I'm just kidding that's a different
kind of gorilla okay there we go so we
got a poster first thing just poster
would look pretty sweet on my wall
it's got skull and some weaponize
yourself stuff on the back there's a
target of a guy it's already
conveniently got bullet holes in it so
you won't have to bother shooting at the
target next we have some stickers g1
killer bullet hole stickers bullet
stickers some more g1 killer stickers
more bullets and more bullet holes
alright we've got that convenient USB
3.0 front panel between a half inch guy
that connects to an internal USB 3
header since most cases these days still
don't have front USB free via a header
that's an awesome feature here we've got
a 3-way SLI bridge we have a two-way SLI
bridge as well as for static cables to
straight and to right angles we also
have a user's manual with a drivers and
utilities DVD download the latest off
the gigabyte website rather than using
that we have a multilingual
installation guide book as well as an
i/o shield that looks pretty cool
because it says do you want color on the
back it's not color coded but it's black
so it looks better so you know you got
to make sure you got to make a judgement
call now do you prefer a good-looking
back panel or do you prefer a labeled
one it all comes down to whether you can
find out where things plug into without
the color coding or whether looks are
important to you and all that personally
I prefer the black one just because I
have no problem finding my USB ports I
know what they look like and since the
USB 3.0 ones are color-coded blue
inside the connector anyway that's not a
big deal uh neither so let's go ahead
close the box here and let's have a look
at the t-one gorilla itself so one of
the first things I noticed about this
board versus its bigger brothers is that
it doesn't have as many power phases so
this is only looks like an 8 plus 2
phase power design for the 1366 socket
it's still a sweet-looking board and it
has a very similar looking cooling
system so why don't we do yeah let's do
cooling first so you got your barrel of
a pistol thing going on here then you've
got all of these LEDs light up and look
cool and this says gaming motherboard on
it so this looks really good and then
you've got your magazine right here with
a bullet sticking out of it as well as a
helpful warning not a weapon cannot be
assembled as a firearm so please be
aware of that you may not recycle this
board once it's you know old and slow
and make a gun out of it it doesn't work
that way all right at the top left we've
bought an 8 pin power connector moving
over we've got our CPU fan connector
we've got six ddr3 slots supporting
triple channel ddr3 our 24-pin power
connectors in its ideal location along
the right-hand edge of the board moving
down some more we've got our SATA
connectors so there are six SATA to
three gigabit per second connectors and
to say two three six gigabit per second
connectors here is our South Bridge
heatsink which we've already looked at
there's our North Bridge heatsink MOSFET
heatsink I don't think I ever said what
they were cooling before front panel
connectors are here we've also got three
front USB headers we've got one front
USB 3.0 header another fan we've got our
front audio connector in its ideal
location along the bottom left not here
where we used to often find them on
gigabyte motherboards our PCI slot
layout is fairly ideal looking let me
have a look at what these are okay so it
looks like what we got here is 16 X 16 X
8 X now the way I would probably use
this board if I was to use it in my
personal system is I'd throw one of my
cards in here I'd throw my other one in
here taking that bandwidth hit because
it actually doesn't affect performance
then that would leave me with a 16x lot
and a 1 X slot for any Edition
expansion cards this is a standard size
motherboard although it's a touch wider
than standard ATX it should fit in most
standard ATX cases but it doesn't have
any additional lengths like the XL ATX
g1 assassin does here is our built-in
creative sound card so you can see here
it's actually isolated where on the PCB
all of those components are located so
that's where you're gonna get better
sound quality from we've got also the
headphone amplifier is built into that
particular part of the board here is our
killer 2100 with its dedicated cache so
that's going to take care of the
ethernet capabilities of this
motherboard here on the back we will
find two ps2 ports one for the keyboard
one for the mouse optical audio as well
as coaxial audio out and OC button which
as you may or may not be able to figure
out based on the name of it will OC your
board that is overclock your board all
right we've got Wow looks like two USB
eSATA combo ports I love those those are
awesome we've got four more
just plain USB 2 ports two USB 3 ports
this is a great mix actually of USB 2
eSATA ports fantastic because you can do
lots of external devices you can do lots
of USB to all that good stuff we've got
a Gigabit Ethernet as well as 7.1 audio
and nothing much to say about the back
of the board except that it has a matte
black PCB
which every single motherboard in the
world should have because it looks great
just want to give gigabyte kudos for
this they've done such a good job of
improving the overall look and feel of
their boards versus their last
generation stuff I mean I bought and at
the x58 extreme back when it first
launched so this was their first x58
high-end board and I actually ended up
getting rid of it to change up for
something that had a very similar color
scheme to this even though I knew it was
an inferior board it was a dfi t 3h
eight or something along those lines so
yeah if I'd had one of these I
definitely would have just kept it
thanks for checking out this unboxing of
the g1 gorilla
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
from our unboxings reviews and other
computer videos and never look directly
down the barrel of a gun it's a really
bad idea
fortunately this isn't a gun it's just a
heat sink just relax</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
