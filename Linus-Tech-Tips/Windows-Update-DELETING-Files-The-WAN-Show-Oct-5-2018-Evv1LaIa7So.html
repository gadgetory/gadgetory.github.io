oh hey yeah how's it going so so this
sucks
ooh yeah so a we actually appear to have
broken 3dmark calm yeah well these guys
that is some pretty that is some pretty
broke dick page loading that they've got
going on here
yikes because Steve from gamers Nexus is
live right now trying to well not trying
successfully beating the record for
single GPU times by extreme that we set
in a video that went up like an hour ago
where's this well this is all so this
includes
any number of GPU so this is obviously
kingpin graphics cards in a technically
not completely supported scenario but
like oh well for you here's a driver you
can you can see there's only like a
handful of people that are running
four-way SLI because it only works in
benchmarks now which is stupid but sure
and then now Steve is has apparently
passed J oh whoa but not by much holy
crap that's really close so I think
that's what people are slamming this
page over and a few passing J it is not
working Steve passing J in SLI passing
us in single GP and he already passed
you know I'm I think so at someone
someone told me that he already did but
that is our video oh yeah oh yeah yeah
our video went up like half an hour
prior and then you know at least the
video was up first
at least the video you held it for a
point of time we held it for a long
enough to get the video edited barely
that was that was really tight like I
was tempted to go like super stealth
about it at but then I was like hi
people are gonna notice on the
leaderboard so I tweeted it yeah it's uh
you know what interesting it was fun
while it lasted we had a lot of I mean
that's
what this is supposed to be about
because overclocking throws a bunch of
salt on Twitter mouthing it's all just
supposed to be about fun cuz
overclocking has no like to this degree
has no practical application like well I
will defend that you would never
actually run a system sub-zero 24/7
unless you're a complete idiot and I'm
allowed to say that because I have done
it that chiller setup from our video
that was my 24/7 rig back when the Core
2 Duo East 66th dude Core 2 Duo as were
awesome so that was like over 10 years
ago I actually had my whole rig like on
a board so that I could move the chiller
the reservoir and the tower in one piece
whenever I needed to move it from place
to place B and I had the whole thing
like insulated permanently so I could
run that 24/7 but that's really stupid
and really impractical for a lot of
reasons so there's no real reason to do
it other than just for the lawls for
bragging rights and to have some fun and
I actually got to say I am I am very
pleased that EVGA and their employee
Vince number kingpins last name I know
Vince I don't remember but I'm it's it's
actually kind of nice that for a change
Vince has stayed out of it for the first
week or so and let other people have
some fun I mean at some point they're
gonna decide ok you know enough of
gamers Nexus and Jays two cents let's
just let's just get this taken care of
and then he'll put up something
unbeatable and whatever but I gotta say
in the spirit of fun I'm glad that EVGA
held the leash back for a little bit and
and they've they've let the you know the
YouTube community kind of have some fun
with this ok cool it's been the first
time I think our community has had some
form of competition yep in this way yep
so that's pretty cool because the
reality
it is like you can kind of you can kind
of extrapolate because he's done sick oh
wait no I think this is this new I don't
know if he had single r-tx 2080 yet oh
no he did okay but he hasn't done dual
but then if you go to number of GPUs for
obviously he's using the same of what
sorry I'm not a screen sharing with you
guys obviously Vince is using the same
cherry-picked 79 80 XE on liquid
nitrogen or liquid helium or whatever
the crap he's using wait a minute hold
on this is one has he beat us no did he
actually like push that number though I
don't know interesting I will at any
rate if you go back to 4x Vince is
already holding the 4x record with 1080
T eyes and by like a huge margin so all
he needs to do is take that same CPU and
then use whatever cooling he feels like
because these vans on 28 et eyes and
then just completely destroy everything
else with that said I don't know if 2080
TI has 4 way in dealing ok people are
saying rip L 3284 46 84 45 what is what
is our 80 360 okay apparently he's a lot
of people are saving 84 4680 446 all
right all right you know what we had our
fun Anthony and I spent actually it
ended up taking a few days getting
everything working because we had a
variety of problems which even if we
don't have the single single 28 et hi
record anymore other than Vince he
doesn't count because he thinks even if
we don't have that anymore
it was a total blast you should
definitely watch the video many
shenanigans so at one point we managed
to almost spray the motherboard with
windshield di sir okay
oh yeah the jank the jank is real anyway
why don't we why don't we get into some
topics here and have some have some
different fun let's have some fun I can
congrats to Steve by the way so by
beating us Steve now has other than
kingpin who doesn't count the top 20
atti score because everything above that
is Titan V's which obviously people have
had a lot more time to spend with and
potentially do the kind of crazy crap
that we've seen at professional
overclocking competitions where I think
the most nutso thing I ever saw was a
graphics card that actually had about
the back third of it just hack sawed off
and then had like this completely
separate outboard power delivery module
that was soldered on to the rest of the
board it was like okay I mean it was
cool it was cool it was pretty cool but
like didn't they even make those
available for sale at some point I don't
think so
or like the backboards yeah yeah
possibly but then you would have had to
have the mid soldering skills not to
mention the like the the diagram like
the board layouts of these GPUs in order
to make any kind of practical use of it
okay so what do we got for topics today
right the headline that's it's huge the
Windows 10 October update potentially
deleting files that's one huge headline
you know what you know my favorite part
about this is which one before I read
that because I I saw the October update
potentially deleting files thing before
I saw it in this doc yeah before I read
that I was prepared to come on this show
this exact twinge of this time to tell
everyone that I was probably gonna
finally give in and install Windows 10
oh really I'm not making that up for
like funsies reasons I I wanted to play
the new Forza so I was like oh maybe
I'll just finally give up it's been long
enough I'm sure it's gotten a lot better
what we are live but unlisted on YouTube
oops shout out to the two viewers
that was yeah massive shout-out to the
two people watching a leg joon-ha behind
it that was that was a big mistake big
problem right there oh crap I can't
believe that just happened
I only checked I wasn't sure what the
difference was between stream options
make archive unlisted when complete and
basic info privacy unlisted lol twitch
twitch masterrace right now because you
guys have been watching apparently one
of the people watching is Steve from
gamers that's on YouTube oh I'm so sorry
everyone watching on YouTube because you
guys missed the first like 10-15 minutes
I accidentally had it unlisted Oh Lord
he's still learning how to use these
things so the big story is today Windows
10 deleting files you want to recap what
you're saying it's been notorious for me
for a while to kind of trash I witnessed
an on the show and talked about how I
don't use Windows 10 I use Windows 8.1
yeah I wasn't planning it as of like
sometime last weekend yeah thought I was
gonna update the Windows 10 because I
want to play the new force' yeah because
it looks sweet it looks awesome yeah and
I like just I'm not good at them at all
but I like playing racing games every
now and then bad like I'm so bad like
you played Forza just racing games oh
I'm so bad like what Mario Kart did you
did you CJ just like walk into the 10k
gaming setup at LTX and just completely
destroy everyone that's a different
situation though still you put it you
put a racing wheel if I can't feel the
actual acceleration and braking like I'm
busy staring at the speedometer and the
tag I crashed or I'm looking out the
window and I go oh I'm going far too
fast and crash like I can't do it at all
yeah where you can feel it but anyways
yeah for more realistic racing games I'm
terrible at them I'm pretty good at
Mario Kart but none of those reals
things wanted to play it anyways was
like you know what I'll give up I'll
finally install Windows 10 I'm sure
they've gotten a lot better over the
last
like quite a while as I've been using
old operating systems and then this week
the week I was planning on announcing
that I read the news article that the
new update is maybe gonna just delete
people's files brilliant so we'll get
into that later and then the actual big
news like we're far larger implications
is that China apparently infiltrated
Apple and Amazon and multiple other
companies with a hardware security
compromised so we'll get into that quite
a bit more later allegedly allegedly
allegedly let's go ahead and run the
intro allegedly
well we're absolutely running yeah a
legend it's being very careful
[Laughter]
like just let our video go up and like
let the momentum starting to go down
you have to just get right in there and
crap all over it which I mean we've I
don't think we're gonna take another run
at it like realistically it's a lot it's
actually a lot of work and so you know
mad respects to the people who you know
get top scores and stuff but I think I
think I think we're done I mean really
what we wanted to do was come out of
nowhere having not acknowledged what was
going on at all
and just be like womp goodbye but then
we didn't have an NB link bridge so we
couldn't do SLI which is what everyone
else was kind of focused on but that's
probably fine anyway because we don't
have the same godlike CPU that Jay has
and we only a even tried one GPU yeah
we're just like okay hopefully this
one's pretty DS here we go
so we got we got lucky we got lucky all
right speaking of getting lucky why
don't we just open with this so it was
posted by Sparta man 64 on the forum the
original article here is from Bloomberg
and there is a fair bit of kind of
uncorroborated information in this
article what's up that people are
yelling that there's a Bloomberg thing
sorry that there's a super chat oh
there's a super time Oh fake news on the
bloomberg article yeah we are gonna talk
about yeah oh boy I think that's the one
they're actually talking about okay so
we know we know there's there's some
weird stuff in the bloomberg article
we'll talk about that later we'll talk
about we'll talk about that gamers Nexus
just sent us a super chat when and you
know the funny thing about this is like
we were just trying to be nice you know
by beating over we were just trying to
no no we raised more attention to no we
sent them a super chat Oh during their
live stream yeah yeah so we were just
trying to be nice I mean the
that it was 84 dollars and 46 cents
which happens to be the single GPU score
Wow hmm is a coincidence and there's
really no reason for Steve to get all
salty about it and like return the money
because I mean really really it was it
wasn't about like you know getting
attention over on his live stream or
whatever this was about wanting to be
supportive of his efforts hmm I mean you
can you can you know you can break a lot
of hardware you know treating it the way
that he is right now so it's just a we
care about the hardware more yeah yeah
exactly exactly I was on a break thing
yeah and we have a lot of respect for
Steve which is why we wanted to support
him and the valuable work that he does
yeah with our 84 dollars and 46 cents
donate to gamers yes today yeah all
right Danny we don't need our charity
but they might need you
oops okay so let's go ahead and let's
let's run through this here shall we so
a Bloomberg report claims claims
allegedly allegedly that China spies
have carried out the most significant
supply chain attack ever known against
American companies what they mean by a
supply chain attack is that instead of
trying to to steal data by intercepting
network traffic or by gaining physical
access to a server that is already
configured and already running and then
and then steal the data that way a
supply chain attack would have the
attacker actually hijack the shipment
physically oftentimes between two
parties neither of which are aware of
what's going on yeah make some kind of
change and then forward it again without
either party becoming aware of what's
gone on so here's the story allegedly
according to the Bloomberg report so in
2015 Amazon began evaluating American
startup called elemental technologies
yada yada yada that became Amazon Prime
video so as part of their due diligence
and
hired a third party company to
scrutinize their security elemental was
apparently using allegedly servers
assembled by Super Micro so we're
familiar with Super Micro we've used a
fair bit of Super micros gear ourselves
including our main file storage server
um I think they're also pretty well
known overall yeah so they were sent to
Ontario for testing the testers found a
tiny microchip about the size of a grain
of rice that wasn't part of the board's
original design the chip apparently
allegedly incorporated memory networking
capability and sufficient processing
power for an attack
so allegedly when the server was
installed and switched on the microchip
could alter the operating systems core
so it could accept modifications and the
chip could contact computers controlled
by the attackers for further
instructions in code so the primary role
of an implant like this would be to open
doors that other attackers can go
through depending on the board model
allegedly the chips varied slightly in
size suggesting that the attackers had
supplied different factories with
different batches Amazon allegedly
reported the discovery to the US
authorities at this time allegedly and
at this time as well elemental servers
could be found in Department of Defense
data centers the CIA's drone operations
and the on-board networks of Navy
warships but elemental is just one of
hundreds of super micro customers so the
allegedly ensuing top-secret probe
remains open today more than three years
later with investigators determining
that the chips allowed attackers to
create a stealth doorway into any
network that included the altered
machines now as with a lot of these
things don't initially necessarily pass
a sniff test here even even like for not
super technical people like here can I
give my my idiot version of why a lot of
this doesn't make a ton of sense ok and
then I'll let you go
sure ok so a chip on a motherboard
unless you're running your router with
like what's it called the auto
configuring stupid thing yes wo man
that's the auto connecting thing if
that's where you're tired yeah no not
that one
what's it called UPnP okay yeah unless
you're running a router with UPnP to my
knowledge there is no way that a machine
on the network can reconfigure the ports
that your network has open and how
they're forwarded so there's there's
even more stuff than just that okay but
that's just that's just the first thing
yeah so one thing I noticed what wasn't
good enough with electronics to really
yeah dive further into but then was
super happy that Wendell started talking
about it on Twitter yeah
was that like a chip of literally that
size and that in that place connections
yeah we would have to be like a 2 to 4
pin chip right like what is it doing
yeah what can you do with two pins so
and people started diving more into that
but it's like it's already weird just at
that level yeah and like this is way
beyond me so but the first hardware
thing that stood out to me and we should
go ahead and we should pop this this
article open here again and one thing I
want to add is that people far better at
this stuff than Linus and I are noticing
these things yeah so so this was the
first thing that popped out to me here's
the board and you can see they're kind
of stripping off components as we go
here and here's the chip so I just I'm
gonna I'm gonna print screen' this real
real quick here there we go ah mspaint
mspaint saves the day okay can we not
shrink this really really oh paint can
you just why why why
okay resize here we go percentage I
don't I don't know 40% there we go good
enough all right so here's the issue so
this this is a type of motherboard that
is pretty typical and what do they call
blade servers yeah so this is where you
basically are just sliding an entire
computer into a small Bay in a larger
chassis that would contain multiple
computers so this is really high density
high density stuff here alright so the
location
was like somewhere around here and the
bloomberg article reports that it was
able to get memory information I'm kind
of sitting here going how because this
is your main motherboard chipset as far
as I can tell and this it actually they
seem to have blanked out some of the
details on this but this isn't much and
I don't know the most about PCB layout
and board design for sure but what I do
know is that you don't go out of your
way to run traces like this
well definitely not on a curse but like
yeah you don't want to run them farm
definitely you don't want to run them
any further than you have to except in
very specific instances like for example
memory high speed memory can benefit
from little zigzags so you'll see little
zigzags and some traces and then you'll
see straight straight traces running to
other places so for example let's say
this is a CPU and this is the like you
know four dimm slots next to it so in
sum can you hold this for me please sure
thank you sir so in some cases you might
see straight traces going out to the
extremities and then you might see
zigzag traces going here and that's
because when you're going real real fast
I'm good when you're going real real
fast it can actually the difference in
the arrival timing of the electrons can
make a difference on that scale so
anyway but for something where you're
transferring I wasn't fully listening to
what you're saying I was reading chat
but AJ saying no it's to match the
length of the lengths of the traces I
know I just said that oh I don't know
it's just trying to put his input in
there okay that was okay okay if it
wasn't clear then it's really important
that that's clear the reason that
they're zigzagging here is because
that's a shorter distance and the reason
that they're not zigzagging at the
extremities is because that's a longer
distance so you got a zigzag here so the
traces are all the same length so that
the timing doesn't get bummed up all
right so anyway that chip in order to
have ax
to memory what was it memory networking
and what else allegedly was it did it
have access to here oh let me go let me
go back to our notes um
doorway into network etc etc what's that
I don't necessarily want to see it ah
interesting answer fen everyone's
spamming that oh I have my phone on
silent what do you want I don't think
anything that I do could reflect poorly
on my image I think people are kind of
used to my nonsense at this point what
can I do for you my feelings are super
hurt actually so you know you know that
you know that event that um that you
went ahead and attended last year where
we kind of like buried the hatchet and
stuff like you were you were there for
that right because I had really
understood that the hatchet was buried
and now it really feel that it feels
like the hatchet has been pulled out but
like not out of you the stump you know
not Under the Sun look Steve I never
pull out okay that's why I got a
vasectomy okay so look it feels like the
hatchet that you pulled out was not in a
stump but actually in my chest and I'm
bleeding right now Steve I'm bleeding
you know what just just just just don't
show up at LTX next year oh just don't
show up even though and then you know
what this is breaking news breaking news
actually we had a great chat with we're
not gonna name any names but we had a
great chat with an unnamed large
and party organizer and it looks like
such don't name them and it looks like
LTX had somewhat confirmed next year is
gonna be more than double the footprint
with a BYOC lan that is gonna have
capacity for hundreds of gamers oh my
god that is actually amazing and by the
way Steve I'm totally joking you have to
be there it's gonna it's going to rock
and of course I'm just messing with you
thank you for thank you for thank you
for being hilarious
consider doing oh yeah no way man it's
gonna be so much better next year we are
really looking forward to it and I mean
I just just so everyone knows like these
events don't happen overnight like we
are absolutely already working on it's
not gonna be happening for like another
8 or 9 months but yeah I'm looking
forward to it and I know I've kind of
missed you at the last couple of events
I don't even think either of us went to
went to the thread Ripper 2 thing did
you go okay well if nothing else I'll
see you at CES right all right okay cool
man all right bye Steve
you guys should consider just for fun
yeah having like an over a live
overclocking panel you could even throw
in like make it make it weird hardware
or something I would actually I thought
you zeroes in 98 hundreds I've always
had more fun overclocking like weird
stuff yeah yeah I get like gt7 tens and
then just see totally yeah go to town it
would be sweet
like you like bring in some weird
hardware and have a little like
overclocking thing anyway so thank you
to raging gamer Sam Landis and Paco
sands who all messaged with super chat
here I'm just seeing it now to answer my
phone sorry I had it muted because I'm
trying to be a bit more of a
professional streamer now just like
my phone would go off all the time
during streams in the past anyway so
yeah I I just don't get people who think
that there's any kind of real like Nana
masa tea between us Steve Jay like any
of those people that's one thing that
the computer hardware review community
has had for a long time is we've all
been kind of friends for a long time
which has been cool there are a couple
of notable exceptions but I'm not gonna
name any names but I will say that none
of them are youtubers like anyone who
thinks that you know me and anyone has
any kind of beef like or that were even
really think of each other as
competitors like yeah like awesome is
coming to dinner like oh yeah just
hanging out not making videos because
sometimes that that's nice to do anyway
let's get back to let's get back to the
chips oh all right
so in response to my initial sort of
reaction here like what could possibly
affect all those things apparently what
it was supposed to affect was ipmi which
I've actually made a video about in the
past and what I PMI is is it is remote
access to the server and it does allow
you to pretty much control the things so
you can get a video feed out you can
actually power it up and down you can
change bio settings you can change
pretty much anything that you would like
about it sort of so back to the
allegedly alright so investigators found
that the chips had been inserted at
factories run by manufacturing
subcontractors in China who makes 75% of
the world's mobile phones and 90% of its
PCs they also found eventually that it
affected almost 30 companies including a
major bank government contractors and
the world's most valuable company Apple
in May 2015 so this is going way back in
time Apple allegedly found malicious
chips on Supermicro motherboards and
severed ties with Super Micro the
following year though for what it
described as unrelated reasons so here's
the part where this gets real
tricky here's the list of everyone who
has denied this Amazon said missus quote
it is untrue that AWS knew about a
supply chain compromise an issue with
malicious chips or hardware
modifications when acquiring Elemental
Apple said on this we can be very clear
they have such an Apple way of talking
to me
Apple has never found malicious chips
Hardware manipulations or
vulnerabilities purposely planted in any
server Supermicro we remain unaware of
any such investigation the Chinese
government supply chain Safety in
cyberspace is an issue of common concern
and China is also a victim okay that's
not really the strongest to denial no no
but the FBI CIS and NSA said no comment
now the company's denials are countered
by six current and former senior senior
national security officials who in
conversations that began during the
Obama administration and continued under
the Trump administration detailed the
discovery of the chips and the
government's investigation in all 17
people confirm the manipulation of super
micros hardware and other elements of
the attacks those actually confirmed or
is that claimed by Bloomberg this is all
claimed by Bloomberg yeah so yeah I
don't know me so there's more allegedly
so here's here's part of the problem
with all of this a denial is interesting
but not necessarily the be-all and
end-all it's not like Apple is going to
you know yeah all of our networks were
compromised yeah well actually they
would they were just verify first why
would they as long as they've fixed it
now and again allegedly one government
official said that no consumer data was
known to have been stolen so if Apple
has found the problem fix the problem
and doesn't have to worry about this
problem popping a
at any point in the future then okay why
why would they go ahead and you
broadcast this on their own funny
interesting thing for me how is super
microstrip saying we remain unaware of
any such investigation it's kind of
interesting that these it's it's so it's
so much of a blanket no so Apple says
note we've never seen anything like this
in a server and China says we're a
victim too yeah that's pretty weird
that's a little weird so I'm not much of
a tinfoil hat conspiracy theory unit but
I can't understand why it would be that
these companies have issued denials and
that everyone is speaking under
condition of anonymity and anima Deon
something like this because you might
have an NDA or you might be subject to
criminal prosecution if you were to talk
about it that's true that's very fair so
now would they go to Bloomberg I don't
know it's a wonderful question so all we
can really do is say hey here's what was
reported by Bloomberg who has not
typically been known to be complete
Yahoo's here's all the denials that have
been issued and there were lots of them
and make of that what you will I didn't
the ICIS and NSA not commenting is not
really a denial to be clear yeah those
are listed under denials but it's not
really until now the only way that we
could know for sure would be if
independent owners of super micro
servers contacted Super Micro asked for
a board layout diagram and check their
motherboards to see if these chips were
present now the problem with that is
that this all allegedly happened a few
years ago and depending on the upgrade
cycle of any given data center it would
be fairly simple and be fairly
straightforward for these these
middlemen to intercept only large-scale
orders intended for a particular
customer
and if the goal wasn't going after
end-users then the goal probably also
isn't your mom-and-pop you know YouTube
channel like us and the motherboard in
their one-off Super Micro server it was
probably looking for these bulk orders
that were that were subcontracted out
because otherwise I believe Super Micro
actually has their own manufacturing
capabilities don't don't quote me on
that one so depending on the upgrade
cycle of the data centers of the
companies they were targeting or
depending on their policies some of them
just destroy Hardware rather than
flipping it on eBay whereas others do
like you'll see you know when 100
gigabit networking gets to the point
where it's affordable and practical all
of a sudden you'll see a bunch of 40
gigabit enterprise gear just flooding a
but not everyone some do that but some
of them don't so we don't know if any of
these servers because we don't know what
models they are have ended up on eBay or
have ended up in the hands of individual
users so there's still certainly more to
come on all of this but all we can say
is what we know for now which is nothing
for certain
I don't even drop a plug here real quick
Oh for my thing is that cool no yeah
yeah go for it was thinking of servers
and infrastructure if you guys are into
that I thought I was done hiring for a
little while but apparently not flow
playing media is looking for a system
administer administrator and what I was
really bad for and is looking for people
to apply now I'm posting it in the
twitch chat I can't I don't have access
to the YouTube thing right now but it
will be in the description on youtube
later on it'll be on the description of
of everything so feel free to apply the
form is like pretty long and asks if you
have experience with a ton of different
things if you don't have experience with
everything on the list that's okay we're
just trying to get a picture of who you
are and what types of things you have
experience with having experience with
Linux administration is obviously pretty
important but the rest of them are a
little bit more flexible cool Microsoft
experience does not help
dang it just well it doesn't dang
doesn't really cross over time let's go
ahead and run through our sponsors here
so synergy yeah synergy lets you juggle
multiple computers efficiently so
there's lots of reasons for people to
have more than one computer whether
you've got a Windows box for gaming and
a Linux box for whatever it is you do on
Linux or you have a Mac for work and
you've got a Windows machine for home or
vice versa or whatever the case may be
it can be a bit of a pain in the button
you end up with like multiple keyboards
and mice or track pads and and you kind
of go yeah ok I know I'm using this one
now
okay so synergy makes it easy you can
just take whatever operating system you
want run it on whatever computer you
want and then you can just seamlessly
use one keyboard and mouse to just move
the cursor across computers start typing
move it across to different computer
start typing you can control them all at
the same time it works on Linux Mac OS
Windows and multiple versions of Windows
so the cool demo that we did a while
back was with that quad input monitor
yeah that actually had four different
operating systems running on it that we
were able to seamlessly switch between
news whatever we wanted that's pretty
pretty frickin cool so check it out over
at seamless comm slash synergy / - tech
tips next up we've got be quiet no
interesting do we have like the case
here I guess it's pretty big so the be
quiet dark bass pro 900 orange red -
well that was that modular case that was
like one of the last cases you reviewed
like way back in the day so they have a
V - of that now so it's modular its
compatible and it looks pretty slick the
motherboard tray can be decoupled and
relocated also it can even be used as a
test bench
it's got modular hard drive slots it
supports up to five hard drives ten SSDs
and two optical drives if you're still
into that sort of thing it's got a
functional power supply shroud that
doesn't just hide the power supply it
can even be used to mount an SSD or a
fan while leaving enough space for a
radiator in the front it's got tempered
glass and LEDs you know because it's
2018 and for i/o it supports USB 3.1
type C and it's also got a wireless
charger for Qi enabled smartphones you
can check it out on Newegg at the link
below the video
finally savage jerky
oh boy oh-ho we got a new shipment I'm
just gonna sit here and eat maple
buffalo bacon and you're not going for
the reaper again this we know no last
time so savage jerky as you guys know
they've been on here a ton they have a
whole bunch of different awesome flavors
13 to be exact of their different jerky
including bacon which is I believe what
you're going for right now maple buffalo
bacon they also make barbecue sauce hot
sauce and spice rub I stole some of that
last week huh they're hot sauces oh it
says right here the hot sauces are so
good Luke and Linus took them home yeah
so we don't actually have I like display
the the last one that was here was um
what is it called jalapeno Momo mmm okay
my like favorite flavor I don't remember
the exact name of it but something Moho
anyways it's it's it's really good stuff
they're jerky is made with the best
ingredients without nitrates or
preservatives with a goal to create a
snack that is full of flavor and spice
that isn't bad for you use offer code
ltte to save 10% off of their products
you can see the link here or in the
description if you're watching later on
all right all right let's talk about
Windows 10 oh boy so this was posted by
dan Castellaneta on the forecastle
Castellaneta Castellaneta dang it
Homer Simpson on the forum not not the
real not the real Homer Simpson
so the original article hears from ZDNet
and basically it's always recommended
like that's the funny thing about this
is it's always recommended when you
perform an update to back up your data
yeah but like over the last couple of
years is it faded is it the smartphone
shift in the industry they don't think
so cuz like it used to be that you got a
warning even on like a smart phone cuz
you don't any of you don't anymore
and windows updates all automatic they
try to barely touch it because people
use the complain of it all time huh but
that's always been considered best
practice
and then now when everyone's gotten lacs
about it it's finally happening
allegedly and not just like a file or -
apparently one user is claiming to have
lost 220 gigs of data after updating
like who so the version number is
Windows 10 1809 and it says here if you
get a warning about Intel drivers do not
proceed okay so all the AMD fanboys are
like so it appears to be related to some
interaction with onedrive oh great where
documents saved in the user directory
and not onedrive will be deleted oh yeah
that's the reverse of what I thought was
gonna happen in that so much yes it also
appears that if you've done anything
non-standard with onedrive or your My
Documents folder it may place your files
at risk and all right went down the
wrong pipe what ii III definitely had I
think a lot of people here he'll know
now that it's the most practical way
especially if you're running a single
box and you don't have an ass the most
practical way to run your storage these
days economically is to have a small
boot SSD for most of your programs and
stuff and then a large hard drive for
your mass storage yeah and the problem
is that Windows automatically puts your
My Documents on your C Drive because
Microsoft still lives in the land of
single drives and computers so it's just
baffling to me that it's just not
automatically tiered anyway a whole
other conversation um but anyway so a
really common thing for people to do
because a lot of programs without asking
will just automatically dump crap in my
documents my pictures my videos like
that kind of thing so what a lot of
users will do if they're managing their
data correctly in fact I think we did a
guide that's got like over a million
views over on NCIX tech tips showing
people how to do this is they'll remap
those those stock system folders to a
folder on their mechanical hard drive so
if you did that it appears that it might
place your files at risk and rolling
back the install does not restore the
missing files
Wow the rollback not restoring the files
in my opinion is worse than its leaving
the files in the first place
oh yeah way worse way worse that's
gnarly and since we're on the subject
what does this windows update even offer
well this was posted by good bytes on
the forum mostly minor changes and to be
clear good bytes is constantly pointed
out as being a hard core yeah mostly
minor changes some features like sets
and alt tab bringing up browser tabs
have been delayed so your phone and app
that your phone an app that will allow
you to better interact with your phone
from your PC allows you to send and
receive SMS messages and interact with
your 25 most recent images from your
gallery on an Android phone so that's
cool cool
but then that should also be coming to
Windows 10 version 1803 so while it's
headlining as an 1809 feature it's
actually an independent app there's a
new clipboard history that syncs with
the cloud and works across devices so
it's being added to Swift key on iOS and
right that's pretty cool that's actually
pretty cool that is quite cool also
comes to the Windows 10 onscreen
keyboard with this update I can't
believe that took so long
Microsoft bought SwiftKey what like two
years ago anyway there's a dark theme
for file explorer ok I could see people
wanting to update for that snipping tool
is being deprecated being replaced by a
new snipping experience no with wind
shift s I don't know it might be fine I
mean do you do not use CRX at this point
anyway yeah ok and the usual
improvements to Microsoft edge browser
want more but like on on systems that I
haven't used before having snipping tool
is really nice new emoji notepad
improvements so all of that sounds worth
giving up some data over it ok ok if
there wasn't if there wasn't the data
loss I will throw them this bonus there
wasn't the data loss if you were if you
were able to recover your data with us
with a system rollback you throw them a
bone yeah pretty much this does actually
sound like a decent update yeah dark
theme is cool the phone app thing is
cool the Swift key copy/paste cloud
thing is cool but yeah
I need my files so sorry not alright and
finally MacBook Pro and iMac pros
require Apple's Diagnostics for certain
repairs ot to chip so you know about the
t2 chip right so that's the encryption
chip on some of Apple's new devices that
basically makes it so that let's talk
about the good things first someone who
steals your device can't get your data I
mean he's cool that's pretty cool yeah
but it does other stuff so on the 2018
macbook pro repairs involving the logic
board ok touch ID all right
that's security related the battery the
keyboard the display the top casing and
the track the track that and the
speakers the speakers the speakers
really to be fair the keyboard battery
trackpad and speakers are all only
included because of the topcase so the
t2 chip if you complete a few complete
repairs like those without apples
blessing will brick your MacBook Pro if
you replace a broken speaker now on the
iMac Pro this makes more sense logic
board and flash storage repairs okay
fine so if any of those parts are
repaired and Apple Diagnostics are not
run the system will be inoperative and
the repair will be incomplete now the
Apple diagnostic suite is limited to
internal use by Apple stores and Apple
Authorized service providers so
independent repair shops without Apple
certification may be unable to repair
certain parts of these machines and in
the case of the MacBook it's like
basically anything now apparently the t2
chip does include more than I thought so
system management controller signal
image signal processor audio controller
and SSD controller and the secure
Enclave but why did it have to include
the audio controller
I'm sure Apple has some kind of reason
but then they also could recognize that
replacing a speaker is probably benign
really frustrating nothing we say or do
is gonna change anything I mean Apple
very intentionally because you bet your
butt they noticed the videos that we
made about our experience with the iMac
Pro very intentionally has not
acknowledged us they've not reached out
offering to help or anything like that
so Apple is just clearly going yeah I
think we're just gonna keep doing this
okay
people aren't upset enough so and the
frustrating thing is it seems to be it
seems to be spreading I mean you and I
were talking about this the other day so
one of the reasons that I went with the
Chevy Volt was that I am really not a
fan of what Tesla's doing with respect
to write to repair the fact that they
are limiting people live basically
limiting the ability to work on these
vehicles to people who have their you
know magic wand blessing what exactly is
that why do we accept that as consumers
and there's youtubers who have made
careers out of trying to find ways to
like forcibly repair Tesla's did you
watch the same documentary I did then I
don't think I've watched a documentary
right I was YouTube video but it was in
a doggy style very likely then I forgot
the guy what the guys needs yeah yeah
yeah he's awesome yeah basically like
awesome dude he's super awesome flat out
um and so really impressive the kind of
stuff yeah I don't really understand why
we're supporting these things because it
is blatantly anti-consumer yeah period
yeah because the security there are some
okay there are some legitimate concerns
in both of these areas yes to defend
them a little bit yeah electric guitars
can be electric guitars it's my day
today man I'm just on point electric
cars can be a little bit problematic if
repaired poorly but like so can normal
cars explosions and stuff right like I
don't know this doesn't seem super hard
to understand not like your there's some
liability involved in repairing some
things huh but generally with most
countries laws if the owner of the item
is repairing it they're taking personal
liability for the repair
and if you pay a shop to repair it that
shop is taking liability for the repair
and the reality of it is that this
industry of like basically massive like
buckets of explosive fuel that people
ride around in has been around for an
awful long time yeah and I think we've
correct me if I'm wrong but I'm not
aware of any situation where a repair
doesn't are repaired something somehow
like a repaired Ford came back to Ford
somehow because of an error that the
repair technician made I don't know if
I'm wrong please do yeah I don't I don't
know honestly I'm sure it has happened
some dude tried to fix this Ford and
then when he failed he brought it to
Ford and Ford was like what the heck
dude I don't know but that's fine oh
you're talking like a repair happened on
a vehicle and then it blew up or
something and got in trouble yeah hmm
not aware of anything like that
happening
yeah personally I don't know all right
we've got a couple of super Chad's
serpent XFS appreciate the love among
tech tubers look forward to next year's
LTX hashtag never pull out rock on man
Spencer says so Microsoft can fix the
update right thanks Spencer good ah vast
horizon I'd send more but this is all I
can afford I love you guys though oh
well thank you
Jordan been watching guys a little over
a year you guys boosted my interest in a
tech career currently attending college
for ICT i TS keep doing what you do rock
on to you too
I think that's pretty much wraps oh this
is a good question okay last topic of
the day and this was actually suggested
here by me oh no I wonder what would
happen if you used the CPUs integrated
heat spreader as a water block so
basically just drill two holes and
solder copper pipes onto it okay so a
couple problems here problem numero uno
you
would have to have some way of like
protecting the rest of the cpu from the
water which will inevitably pick up some
ions that will make it conductive and
then obviously that's going to be a
pretty bad scene
problem number ii as far as I know most
IHSS are not fully sealed so you would
have to make sure that you actually
complete the seal and do a good job
there problem number them next is
they're quite small and so actually
getting like large enough Barb's that
you'd be able to get the kind of flow
rate that you want for the first for
optimal cooling would be a little bit
difficult number problem number the next
is that having the die soldered or
liquid metal to an IHS probably
increases your surface area helping with
cooling more than the benefits of having
the water directly touching the die
would help I guess is what I'm trying to
say so having this bigger area where
you've got a slight barrier that you
have to pass through versus having a
very small area I suspect they'd
probably like thought of that at some
point but it seems like the kind of
thing that we'd be crazy enough to try
so I'm not saying we're never gonna do
it cool suggestion someone said sorry
wizard Mon said a hundred Ford's start
firing crashes and not a single person
cares 1 Tesla hits a barrier at high
speeds spraining an ankle of the driver
and the car slowly starts off on fire as
he limps away national TV newspapers
talk shows reblogged 12 million times
this argument has been brought up many
times personally I don't think it's a
valid enough reason to take rights away
from consumers and I think we can end
the show right there
