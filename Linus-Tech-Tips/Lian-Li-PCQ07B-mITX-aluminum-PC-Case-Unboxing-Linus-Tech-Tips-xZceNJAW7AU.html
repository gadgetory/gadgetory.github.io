shipment finally arrived it was delayed
by the the typhoon they had over there
and if you haven't seen it already in
our forum we have a thing where you can
donate your forum points to help us gave
the the software's over there so we are
making a donation as a company so check
that out in our forum anyway here's the
case it's a mini ITX enclosure from Lee
and Lee that I thought would be pretty
interesting to people because it's
probably the most stylish mini ITX
enclosure at least info goes I haven't
seen it in person yet that we've ever
seen so let's just get it out of the
wrapping here let's see it comes with an
installation guide where you can see
that we've got sort of a layout of the
case itself motherboard installation
harddrive installation power supply
installation anyway so let's have a look
at this case so basically we've got a
five and a quarter inch bait power and
reset switches two front USB ports and
then if we go around to the side here
you can see you've got lots of
ventilation holes and the side panel is
actually removed by taking off six
screws I'm not I'm not really sure how
much I like to see this kind of system
for removing a side panel with with so
many other manufacturers going to list
and even Lee and Lee going to list
across a lot of their case line it seems
like kind of a step backwards to have
such a such a clunky system for this but
I mean the case has a lot of other
things going for it
so let's talk a little bit about that so
first of all you can install one three
and a half inch drive you can install
one five and a quarter inch drive as we
saw in the front but the neatest thing
about this case which I will get to as
soon as I have these screws off
hopefully you're planning to just put
this together once and not take it apart
again after that so here we go
and come on
we there we go oh don't get away all
right so there's the you can see the
finishing is is immaculate just like you
would expect from any lien Li product
very very nice nice thick gauge aluminum
even on such an inexpensive enclosure so
once we get inside you can see through
the back this accepts a full sized ATX
power supply unlike so many other of the
micro ATX cases on the market so that is
a really unique selling point for this
case so let's take out the accessory box
and let's have a look at what we get in
there so this is going to be your
mounting hardware and let's say it's a
couple cable management pieces some
rubber grommets for mounting your hard
drive some thumb screws oh six thumb
screws no no I can't tell what these are
for we'll get to that later I guess then
and then on the inside you can see we've
got lean Lee's rubber grommet mounting
hard drive thing here you've got your
IPX backplate on the back there so you
can mount your ITX motherboard there
you've got your front USB cables here
you've got your power and LED switches
and lights here and then up at the top
that's where you mount your optical
drive so let's go around to the back so
you've got one expansion port one little
wireless antenna slot that you could
potentially plug something into and then
you buy your i/o panel and then we go
around to the other side and it's just
plain plain black and so actually the
whole thing is very stylish very cool
looking and thank you for checking out
