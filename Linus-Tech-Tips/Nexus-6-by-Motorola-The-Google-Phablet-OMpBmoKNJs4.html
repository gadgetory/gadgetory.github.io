with the Google Nexus 6 so I decided to
shake things up and start at the end
when I'm reviewing a phone I put my
personal SIM card the only one I have in
and I leave it there for at least a
couple weeks while I get a feel for what
it's really like to use the device as a
daily driver
I believe this gives every phone a
chance to win me over and become my new
day-to-day and the conclusion for me on
this one is that it squandered that
chance on the subject of driving though
by the time you guys see this my team
and I will already be at CES 2015 so
don't miss any of the awesome content
that's coming your way as far as
hardware specs are concerned the Nexus 6
is a worthy follow-up to the Nexus 5
improving on it in almost every
conceivable way the quad-core Snapdragon
processor is now an 805 and clock 15
percent faster with three gigs of RAM
and 32 or 64 gigs of non upgradable
storage to go with it the adrenal 420
GPU is in the neighborhood of 40% faster
and good thing because the AMOLED screen
has 76% more pixels with a massive 2560
by 1440 resolution the battery gets
bumped to 32 20 milliamp hours the rear
camera weighs in at a respectable 13
megapixels for stills with up to 4k
30fps video recording support and you
get a fancy-pants ring flash for more
even shadows for close-ups oh yeah you
also get a smexy nano coating for the
body that Harris from IT tech worldcom
found kept the phone from being killed
even while completely submerged in water
onto the body then I guess the solid and
very premium feeling aluminum body of
mine is wrapped front and back in addy
brand vinyl skin that gives the back of
pleasing leather look and feel it makes
the front look an awful lot like a white
note too although many other finishes
are available at the back of the phone
is the main camera with its ring flash
moving down we find a little dimple that
would have a Motorola logo a cutout in
my skin for the Nexus logo and a noise
cancellation microphone it should be
noted though that the Nexus 6 does not
feature the same quad mic array as the
Moto X 2014 unfortunately around the
edges of the phone
we find microUSB nothing on the left a
nano SIM tray and headphone jack and my
preferred position on the top and on the
right the lock button and volume rocker
and these are awful
I think I'm batting about 500 for
hitting whichever button I'm aiming for
thanks to them being extremely close
together and way too easy to press with
Google roll as some not really sure who
to blame here so I'll go with both
genius idea to help you differentiate
between them being a subtle texture to
the lock button I know I harp on this a
lot but for crying out loud
manufacturers the volume and lock are
often the only physical buttons you're
giving us on a phone
surely that means you understand that
they're important and we might want to
use them which brings us around to the
front the Nexus 6 is Gorilla Glass 3
covered 5.9 six inch display features
phenomenally fine image quality vibrant
colors and wicked contrast making
Android L's new visual design and really
anything else look absolutely gorgeous
my only complaint about the screen is
that just like the droid turbo it has a
noticeable green shimmer at some mostly
very extreme angles but it doesn't
bother me day-to-day the size of the
screen lands this phone solidly in
phablet territory and while as someone
with small hands my feelings about these
devices that they're ridiculously large
and difficult to handle shouldn't be a
surprise but I have to give Google
credit for being clever enough to at
least give it a curved shape you know
like a hand so in spite of its
significantly larger screen size I
actually find it much easier to hold on
to than the iPhone 6 plus I also have to
give them credit for front facing
speakers you can have the best speakers
in the world but if they're playing in
the house next to you they're still
going to sound like muffled farts while
the Nexus 6 is both loud and clear
enough for content enjoyment in a moving
car which is my standard benchmark and
it actually sounds overall pretty
freakin good for a phone battery life
was also pretty freakin good and I
regularly had 40 to 50 percent left at
the end of the day the large
high-resolution display will negatively
impact battery life but Android lollipop
comes with some efficiency improvements
and AMOLED screens can be much more
efficient than LCDs when a lot of the
screen is black lighting only the pick
that are needed so you can use the handy
motion activated ambient display feature
that displays notifications when they
come in or if you move the device
basically guilt free and very heavy
users can rejoice because the battery
charges both quickly with Qualcomm quick
charge 2.0 and conveniently with qi
wireless charging in theory I found
correctly aligning the phone for
wireless charging was actually pretty
hit or miss on my car dock but your
mileage may vary camera time I have very
mixed impressions of the camera on the
Nexus 6 the hardware seems great with
dynamic range right up there with the
iPhone 6 with shockingly little detail
lost in the branches of the trees and in
the sunny houses in the background here
but our flower subject is not as well
exposed under studio lighting it takes
awesome sharp images of my subject Alby
--it without a very pleasing
out-of-focus effect in the background
and auto white balance was handled
better than any of the other Android
phones that I checked out in my test
suite you can actually download these
test shots in the link in the video
description but on the other hand the
scenario where I use my phone most close
and medium range shots without ideal
lighting had the Nexus 6 this camera
performing a boat as well as the potato
camera on my iPhone 4 with autofocus
completely crapping the bed in some
cases I know that some people are
wetting themselves over the new camera
API that should allow raw shooting and
lots of other goodies with alternate
camera apps but I don't give a toss
about raw and frankly providing better
tools to third-party developers while
admirable is not an excuse for the
abysmal included camera app it's slow to
launch slow to take pictures infuriating
to navigate why does the settings cob
only appear when I swipe from the left
why are there four menu items here when
none of them contain anything and all
the good stuff is in one of the menus
anyway just put them all in the same
place and why do the photo and video
modes both of which should just be
accessible at the same time like Sony
does it remember which camera they were
using last time rather than purely
changing modes and changing cameras
independently I've never seen this
before and it's really unintuitive and
it completely lacks features that are
taken for granted in
in phones these days there's no burst
picture mode no time-lapse no slow-mo
not even 60fps I mean okay it's got 4k
video capture but it drops frames all
over the place anyway I mean I know I'm
ragging on the camera a lot here but
this is a six hundred plus dollar
flagship grade device we always gave
Nexus phones a free pass to have sucky
cameras because we were still getting a
great deal but this one has the hardware
so it appears that Google is just
sitting on ass waiting for someone else
to fix it for them so I gotta call them
out on it and the renting actually
doesn't end here under the hood Android
5.0 seems awesome the NFC based setup
wizard and quick logging into accounts
was great it's got more robust
notification management including
separate rules for high priority
applications that can be toggled in
seconds the more efficient art runtime
is now mandatory user and limited access
accounts are now supported and security
has been beefed up for business users
but I have never been so excited for the
handset vendors to put their own
finishing touches on a google os I tend
to give software bugs a bit of a pass in
my reviews because I'm usually reviewing
the device very close to launch and in
good faith I believe that by the time
many people watch my video
the little glitches will have been
sorted out anyway so I don't want to
waste time on them but for crying out
loud Google this is the launch device
for lollipop and you still can't get
Wi-Fi working reliably are you serious I
mean iOS 8 is still bugged on a couple
of the apps that I like to use but I can
forgive that stuff
Wi-Fi just cutting out and requiring a
device reboot to fix it every time
seriously and my frustrations with the
Nexus 6 don't end here I mean here are
some more in no particular order the
multitasking rolodex interface is much
more natural to use than Kit Kats
default design but the icon for it is
atrocious I mean good luck explaining
this one to your mother the lock screen
displays only a few more recent
notifications and to access the rest you
have to swipe down rather than up what
the old Google calendars month view
sucked but instead of improving it
they've removed it entirely on phones
now thanks for nothing and the haptic
feedback is among the worst I've ever
encountered makes it feel like the
device
is falling apart the stock keyboard took
a sharp turn at artsy-fartsy junction
presumably for the sake of making its
design more material and now has no
dividing lines between characters and I
mean where the heck is the restart
button some Android devices have it but
for some reason it's become unpopular
with the cool kids I mean I guess I
probably have Apple to thank for this
rubbish but at least in their defense
and my four plus years of using various
iphones i've needed to do fewer restarts
to fix Wi-Fi connectivity than i have in
two weeks with the nexus 6 so it feels
like the least google could have done
was make it a bit more convenient for me
so since I did the conclusion at the
beginning of this video I don't really
have much to say other than I don't
think the Nexus 6 is worth your 650
dollars I think there are better options
out there and other than that well thank
you 2d brand for providing me with the
Nexus 6 that I used to make this video
and asking in return only that we point
out that they carry an incredibly wide
variety of precision cut - skins for
tablets phones game consoles and other
electronics to give them a unique look
and feel at a reasonable price
also notice that dbrand now carries
gorilla glass screen protectors that are
only marginally thicker than their vinyl
wraps making for a smoother transition
when swiping your finger over your phone
than ever before and keeping pretty much
your whole device protected from
incidental scuffs and scratches so
thanks again 2d brand
and thanks to you guys for watching like
this video if you liked it dislike it if
you disliked it leave a comment if you
completely disagree with my assessment
of the Nexus 6 and if you think I'm just
biased against big phones because I have
small hands which has no implications
for other parts of my body also check
out the link in the video description if
you want to support us to make more
videos just like this one you can give
us a cool t-shirt layer you can know you
can have a cool t-shirt like this when
you give us money we give you a t-shirt
you can change your Amazon bookmarked
when the fire affiliate coder you can
just outright give us a monthly
contribution if you really appreciate
what we do we appreciate we appreciate
that a lot that's got an awkward thanks
again for watching and as always don't
