the surly bonds of Earth and tumble
unfettered amongst the clouds to gaze
upon the earth as an angel or an
albatross to ascend into the frosty
windswept glory of altitude but despite
my many attempts to gain access to the
wheeling and whirling eddies of the
atmosphere
I have always ended up grounded which is
why when the power-up fpv arrived in the
mail i was beside myself with its
mounted Wi-Fi camera and Google
cardboard support it claims to let you
experience flight as if sitting in the
cockpit of your very own paper airplane
at last my chance to soar or so I hoped
so tax Magnus en 10 mini gaming PC is VR
and triple-a gaming ready check it out
at the link in the video description
expectations were high opening the box I
couldn't wait to tear it open and start
building my very own paper drone they
have a video tutorial that covers how to
properly fold it and the process wasn't
overly difficult with a decent stack of
sheets provided to allow for mistakes so
in no time at all the drone was folded
and ready to fly unfortunately this is
where we hit our first major setback you
see I live in the Pacific Northwest and
the drone is not advertised as being
waterproof once the skies cleared though
we downloaded the app charged the drone
and set off to a nearby field to at last
experience the joy of flight
unfortunately Tyler and his camera
operator being the inexperienced pilots
that they are didn't have a lot of luck
with it
after fine-tuning their plane by moving
the wing support bar back and adjusting
the elevators I didn't have any trouble
getting it into the air but it was still
a pretty disappointing experience
because it flies like a plane and not
like a quadcopter and because turning is
handled by slowing one of the two
propellers at the back of the skeleton
its turning radius is very wide if you
don't want to lose a lot of altitude
since you've basically only got one
motor running which means not as much
lift for the airfoil so the fpv can only
be used in wide open spaces I would also
recommend avoiding anything but soft
terrain the fpv doesn't land so much as
it crashes gently and anything firmer
than a bed of soft grass can potentially
break the propeller though I will give
them credit for including some extras in
the Box it boasts a 20-minute battery
life but from
I experienced admittedly on a somewhat
chilly day the actual time spent in the
air will probably be significantly less
than that after a pre-flight video check
a false start and some adjustments a
minute or so in the air and then ten
minutes of following these by the way
very helpful loud beeping noise that it
makes when it crashes through some
blackberry bushes into the bank of a
nearby stream I was initially pleased to
discover I still had 60% battery left
great let's go again and as soon as I
launched it dropped to 45% then seconds
later the low battery alert cut the
motors forcing me to land but what's it
like soaring through the air does it let
you experience flight as if you were
sitting in the cockpit of your very own
paper airplane I guess so
if the cockpit of your very own paper
airplane is streamed over an ISDN
connection with vaseline cleared on the
glass this is actually my first first
person flying experience in VR and while
the setup is simple and the like where
you look is where you go controls work
great provided you don't lean over too
far the app connectivity is flaky at
best and the choppy poor-quality video
feed makes it quite difficult to orient
yourself making crashes pretty much
inevitable though all of this wouldn't
really be that much of an issue if the
power of fpv was a budget entry in the
market it's not like while it's in the
air it's not genuinely pretty cool and
I'd be ok shelling out 20 or maybe even
like 50 bucks for a novelty item that'll
get a few hours of use out of before I
crash landed in the street and it gets
run over by a car but this drone is
being sold at a retail price of $200 and
I can get way more airborne
entertainment for that kind of money
these battle drones we featured on
channel super fun r2 460 and a total
last building and crashing them together
so I guess the bottom line then is this
for its cost and considering the
plethora of other options on the market
for flying toys right now from cheap
units to expensive high-end quad copters
I'm just not really sure who the powerup
FPV is supposed to appeal to you know
