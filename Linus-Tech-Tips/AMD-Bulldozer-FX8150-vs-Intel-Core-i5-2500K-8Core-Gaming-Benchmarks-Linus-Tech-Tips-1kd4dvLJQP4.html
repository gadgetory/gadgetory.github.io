it is an a3 plus motherboard featuring
full support for a salon across fire X
and AMD bulldozer eight core CPUs this
is an fx-8150 installed on a crosshair
five formula now the crosshair 5 formula
is the board that was used by 99% of the
reviewers out there for their bulldozer
launch coverage so what I'm aiming to do
here is to find out whether the
crosshair 5 formula will perform any
different from the MSI equivalent
high-end gaming skew with a single sixty
nine seventy eight gigs of ddr3 memory
and an 81 50 FX eight core CPU from AMD
so I have done my first set of run
throughs now I can't get the witcher 2
running properly right now it's
something to do with the game updating
and my save files won't load and so i'm
going to have to examine that but for
now i want to bring you the results that
i can so what i'm going to be doing is
i'm going to be running the crosshair 5
the 990 FX 8 GD 80 and then for
completeness sake I'm going to throw a
2500 K into the mix and that will be on
a z68 board right there so that's the
z68 ad dat just to see how the 8150
compares against its closest competitor
price-wise on the intel side so I've
done my run through with the 990 FX ad d
ad board now and see what it's called
Dale Nick just so you guys know that I'm
telling you what it is and I've only
encountered one very curious result so
on the top are my numbers with the 990
FX a and on the bottom are my numbers
with the crosshair 5 so you can see
these gaming numbers are very close
metro 2033 is within the margin of error
Battlefield Bad Company 2 within margin
of error Crysis 2 within margin of error
and loss yeah Lost Planet 2 is identical
and finally dirt 3 is well within margin
of error but Cinebench for some reason
perform dramatically better on the GBA T
so before I put my cindy bridge where is
it
2500 K on the bench I'm going to go and
I'm going to throw the
across there five back on there just to
give it another shot at that Cinebench
benchmark let's see if maybe it was just
an anomaly looks like it was purely an
anomaly guys 5.8 4 is well within margin
of error of 5.8 2 so I'm going to go
ahead and say that these boards perform
pretty much identically with the 8150 at
stock speeds now I'm going to go ahead
and get on with my Sandy Bridge testing
well my Sandy Bridge numbers are
complete so this is with the same test
platform except for a different CPU and
different motherboard obviously and I
think the overall conclusion is that a
whole lot is being made about the
bulldozers performance or lack thereof
against its sandy bridge counterparts
but looking at the test settings that
are being used in a lot of places I
don't really feel they're all that
realistic so for all of the games that
I'm running I'm running at 1080p which
is the full resolution of this monitor
which most gamers are transitioning
towards if they're not already using it
and then I'm also running at high
details with anti-aliasing and
anisotropic filtering on in most cases
and you can see here that in most of the
games most of the applications I'm
running my average and my minimum frames
per second are very very playable at
those settings so yeah this is one of
the things where I'm kind of looking at
it going well okay yes the 2500 K does
perform better you can see there are
games where it really pulls away such as
Crysis 2 where we're looking at sort of
outside the margin of error in terms of
the performance difference somewhere in
the 8 percent range Lost Planet 2 it
does perform a little bit better
remember that one's a canned benchmark
so that should be fairly representative
dirt3 it does pull ahead this is a CPU
limited game and it's about 5 percent
better but it doesn't perform as well
and something heavily threaded like
cinnamon for example I mean yes it's not
that far behind considering the fact
that the 2500 K is a cheaper processor
than the 8150 but you also have to bear
in mind that the platform is more
expensive if you want to build a gaming
rig like let's say dual 6970 gaming rig
with high-end gaming CPU bunch ram etc
etc you're looking
at on the low end a 90-70 chipset for
AMD or a 990 X which are both still
prosper capable whereas with Intel if
you want a crossfire or sli ready board
you have to use a P 67 or is e 68
gorgeous or significantly more expensive
so you do have to factor that in so
thank you for checking out my little
video where we did establish that
there's really no difference in
performance between 1 990 FX board and
another with the bulldozer
8150 FX chip and then that the
performance Delta between the 2500 K and
then 8150 is while significant yes it is
significant in some cases may not be a
deal-breaker especially if you're
running at sort of real-world
resolutions in real-world games don't
