the trendnet TW 684 you be this is a 450
megabit dual-band wireless-n USB adapter
ok this was released around the same
time as the trendnet TW 691 dr now this
is a 450 megabit wireless-n gigabit
router however what you may notice about
these two products is that this one is
actually capable of higher speeds than
this one and these were we're sold as
like like a matched pair you can see
it'll probably recommend no it doesn't
ok well whatever trendnet pitched it as
those should work together pretty well
which they will they will run at 450
megabit per second which at the time was
not available from any other
manufacturer however trendnet has
recently released an updated dual-band
450 megabit per second concurrent
wireless and router this is the TW 692
gr and you can see that these guys
actually have matching charts whereas
the 691 that chart ends at 450 megabit
per second so here you can see for 50
megabits per second dual band is even
better than 450 megabit per second which
is even better than 300 megabit per
second dual band which is better than
and so on and so on and so forth so
today's unboxing is going to be for the
truly matching router for that wireless
adapter which provides up to do once he
gets the plastic off then he will talk
about the product there we go all right
up to 900 megabit per second of total
wireless throughput concurrent dual band
technology generates two separate 450
megabit per second wireless and networks
at the same time one touch network
connection with Wi-Fi Protected setup
all gigabit wired ports which is an
essential feature for any of these 300
megabit plus wireless routers in my
opinion because otherwise you're just
going to be bottlenecked by the wired
ports anyway alright green net
technology lowers energy consumption by
seventy percent remember green net tech
green net net to technology turns off
certain ports powers things down allows
your router to be less power consuming
than other routers advanced wireless
encryption up to wpa2 radius now it's
firewall protection internet access
control of mac and URL filtering and
ease of use with an easy web browser
configuration remote management and
support
a universal plug in play personally I
love universal plug in play some people
say it's for newbs I say fine then I'm a
noob because I like it all right here we
go dual-band wireless-n USB adapter
something something here it is oh no
that's the wireless end gaming adapter
there's the wireless n USB adapter and
here is the router and here is how they
envision your network to pretty much
work cool beans okay what else we got
here that's it let's open it up let's do
the unboxing part that's right in the
title of this video 692 gr unboxing so
far I have unboxed nothing here we go so
there's a quick installation guide which
is in USA in Britain language or also
known as English before you start
hardware installation and how to
configure the wireless router we have a
disc which has a user's guide on it so
maybe don't throw that away might be
useful next we have a power adapter
fairly small wall wart made by best tech
it's the best it's tech plugs into your
router makes it go makes the little
turbines inside spin next we have the
wireless routers no we don't okay next
we have an ethernet cable it's blue has
plugs on the end finally we have a
mounting bracket which I will take out
because we might show you how to use
that if I can figure it out on camera
and I'm going to take off the plastic
which will reveal the incredibly shiny
line is yeah i'm not going to show you
the cameraman in the reflective surface
sorry guys yes it is the true cameraman
helping me today the cameraman the apple
enthusiast not not Darth Vader not crazy
Russian none of the others okay so let's
have a look at the router itself this
one features a green net badge on it
which the 691 gr does not have it also
features a dual band for 50 megabit per
second logo on it you've got the
trendnet branding here on the top you've
got the WPS button this is very
conveniently located you know what I'm
kind of getting tired of seeing WPS
buttons that are like on the back of the
router or like on the side or on the
bottom or wherever they end up being
this is convenient right on the top very
nice kudos trendnet all right we have a
power we have Oh interesting they're
using an internet explorer logo for the
LAN port okay so then you got your for
land indicators
your wireless indicators and your WPS
LED indicator you've got a reset switch
here on the side as well as some
ventilation holes there's a fair amount
of performance in a device like this so
those ventilation holes are probably
needed you got some more ventilation
holes as well as the antennas on the
other side of the devices is a fairly
unconventional layout usually on a
router you see kind of nothing lights
nothing and then ports and and a debt
and net antennas and reset switches and
everything on the back but on this one
instead we've only got the ports on the
back so these are all gigabit network
ports there's your LAN port and there is
your power input on the back of the unit
itself now it has on the bottom not a
whole lot going on and I want you guys
to note that it does have three
dedicated antennas and these cannot be
removed so these are built in antenna so
I will be doing some testing on the 69
2gr against its little brother the 69
1gr with the the sky ah the concurrent
and USB adapter so stay tuned for that
on my NCIX comm channel don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips from on
boxing's reviews and other computer
videos cameraman figured out how the
mount worked so basically all you do is
you take the router and you put it on
there yeah it's actually that
uncomplicated so what that means is and
this is actually smarter than it first
appears because ok for one thing it just
plugs into your ventilation holes at the
bottom you can still access your reset
switch they did think of that and for
another thing look at what this does so
it puts it up this way so you can see
your indicator lights from the front
still it takes all of your antennas and
puts them up higher which seems like
logically intuitively might be better
right and then last but not least it
still leaves all of your ports at the
back see smart</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
