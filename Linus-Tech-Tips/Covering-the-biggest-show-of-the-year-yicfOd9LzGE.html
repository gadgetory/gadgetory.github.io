ourselves making over 50 videos in a
span of like five days at CES this year
we will do the same but Dennett we're
gonna do it smaller lighter better and
much much more stylist Lee
first up are the tweaks we're making to
editing obviously I got every one razor
blades whose quad core Core i7 CPUs 16
gigs of ram and desktop GTX 1060
graphics will cut through our editing
timelines pun intended like expensive
knives through butter but it's me ichy
pout and got the 512 gig person so what
do this is where the angel bird pkt
external USB 3 Drive comes in
they sent us the one terabyte version
which is a great size for on-the-go
editing thanks to sustained read speeds
in excess of 300 megabytes per second
timeline performance is excellent with
our standard Sinha forum 1080p files and
it even handles red 8k raw playback
pretty darn well physically I can't help
but marvel at the size to its head and
shoulders smaller than all the other
portable drive solutions we've used in
previous years and there are some other
clever things as well trim is supported
on Windows or Mac and the type-c
connector on the drive is recessed to
protect the cable from any unnecessary
strain which is comforting since a dead
portable drive during an event like CES
would be devastating drive to drive
transfer speeds were tested at around
250 megabytes per second which combined
with the easily swappable included USB a
or C cables means that sharing footage
between our editors can be done without
any dongles
speaking of dongles though since they
seem to be the way of the future at this
point we settled on these juiced systems
biz hubs as great as the Razer Blade is
we're still missing a few things in the
i/o department to truly make our lives
as effortless as possible but this hub
has an extra HDMI 1.4 out 3 USB 3.0
ports full size Ethernet and the SD and
micro SD card readers we so desperately
need its driverless so you
just plug it in and you're good to go
and I've been really happy with the one
that I bought a couple months ago and
they generously offered to send them for
the rest of the team you might be
thinking carrying a dongle sucks and
Linus there are lots of laptops with all
that i/o built in and that's true but a
14-inch blade and a dongle versus the
laptops that we brought with us last
year to CES there's no contest now let's
talk about the rigs not PC rigs camera
rigs what's the point of better editing
flexibility and i/o if we don't have
better footage to work with here are a
couple of updates that we've made to our
rigs so our a7 s2 cameras whose compact
size and stellar low-light performance
makes them ideal for show coverage where
booth lighting is anything but
consistent will be equipped with new
battery banks from anchor that increased
their life between charges from about 45
minutes to over 3 hours with a little
clamp on the camera we also finally got
tired of the static and pops in our
wireless audio and moved to electro
Sonic's wireless system we still plan to
use wired hammer microphones for our
hosts but having a reliable wireless
backup in case our host wants to conduct
an interview or needs an extra hand to
pick something up without risking
dropping it well we'll have that now
they cost us eight thousand dollars for
two kits which is more than many top
youtubers spend on camera and lights
combined but we haven't had a single
audio issue since we started using them
so money Wells bent also new this year
shooters will be able to choose between
a tripod and handheld a monopod a
shoulder rig or a Chinese knockoff
version of the easy rig that we bought
on eBay shooting with a tripod gives you
Rocksteady shots like we would have
while working in the office while also
allowing you to set the tripod down and
quickly go handheld at any given moment
the main disadvantages of a tripod for
shows like CES is that it requires a
much larger footprint to use and when
you
find yourself in a tight space or a
crowded room it becomes cumbersome
quickly it's also much heavier to bring
around and takes longer to adjust your
height versus Brandin preferred method
of shooting it shows the monopod monopod
take less space while also giving you a
similar steadiness compared to a tripod
but they allow height adjustments with
just one latch at a time where the
monopod has its quirks is in the
consistency of getting smooth pans and
tilts as well as static shots since you
only have one point of contact with the
ground
additionally setting a monopod down is
typically not recommended since they are
prone to well tip tip typically tipping
over shoulder rigs can be a comfortable
way of doing hand held for an extended
period of time also allowing you to move
between shots quite quickly but the
disadvantage is that the movement of
shoulder rigs is not as steady as a
monopod or a tripod and they can get
much more tiring on your arms and back
walking around all day on the show floor
so meet our newest addition to the
stable of stabilization products we use
our knockoff version of the EZ rig this
oh so excellent fashion statement is
composed of what is essentially a frame
backpack that terminates into a metal
support that hooks onto the top handle
of basically any camera rig this
transfers most of the weight from your
shoulders and neck to your hips making
shooting handheld a much more ergonomic
and less tiring experience while also
making you look like the second biggest
camera dork on the planet first biggest
that's an honor that's reserved for
Brandon who added bungeed and gear tied
Kong frog clips to make putting the
camera on and off the easy rig much
simpler so you have the option to set
the camera down quickly when you're not
rolling the main disadvantage with the
EZ rig is that foot steps are more
easily transferred into
mint so the operator will need to be
careful of his or her footwork to get
the most out of the system our last
piece of gear was generously provided by
Logitech as much as we love our big
headphones for here in the studio when
you're traveling and when you need the
utmost and noise isolation on a crowded
show floor to monitor audio nothing
beats a good pair of in-ear monitors
that is where the ultimate ears 900s
comes in these are excellent IMS with a
relatively neutral sound signature and
in the Box they come with a wide variety
of ear tips for nearly any ear shape all
of this while being relatively
lightweight and very easy to carry
around with an included hard and soft
bag for carrying the headphones
themselves have a braided cable and are
fairly comfortable with a good
resistance to falling out while moving
around and the cable can be switched out
if anything were to happen to your
connector so we won't be left hanging if
anything snags our IMS what a funny
video the zone balance gaming chair from
Tesoro is a racing style design chair
composed of a steel frame with
polyurethane faux leather I'm sure
there's some padding in there somewhere
to the high backrest is set on their
website to provide full spinal column
support as opposed to full spinal
question mark support like it would if
your spine was in the shape of a
question mark it has a steel base with
the clasp for hydraulic clasp four
Pistons to adjust the seat height and
comes with head and lumbar support
cushions you can check it out at the
