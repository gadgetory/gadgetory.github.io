the Asus vivo Tab smart this is a
Windows 8 tablet so it is not an RT
tablet which I personally find quite
exciting that means that you are not
locked into only the applications that
you can get on the marketplace in in
Windows 8 / Windows RT you can install
regular desktop applications and use
them on a tablet even if they're not
designed on a tablet which can give you
a lot of flexibility and asus has kind
of been all about flexibility with their
tablet offerings giving you the option I
mean with the original transformer to
add like keyboard to it and just sort of
generally cool stuff like that so here's
the tablet itself it looks pretty much
like a tablet so not much out of the
ordinary there in terms of specs it's
running an intel clover trail Atom
processor 2 gigs of ram it has 64 gigs
of solid-state storage as well as o
check that out it has NFC no way that's
sweet
okay sorry sorry sorry I got distracted
so it has up to an eight and a half hour
battery and eight megapixel rear camera
so that's right there which also has an
included flash I think I'm probably
missing some specs here this was kind of
amusing to me they have two of exactly
the same sticker on the back of its in
French I get it
I couldn't actually find any difference
because none of the specs are actually
in French like they just put two G
instead of G small oh and yeah that's a
clover trail because apparently it's
close review my dad so it has Wireless
BGN Bluetooth 4.0 2 megapixel front
camera and that's pretty much it that's
all I missed wow I was doing pretty cool
alright so let's go ahead and have a
look at what they include in terms of
accessories you've got an asus wall wart
which basically looks like any other
Asus wall wart and then you've got a USB
two micro USB cable that you will plug
into that and use as a charging cable so
unlike Asus is Android tablets we do not
have their custom dock connector see no
dock connector on the bottom it is just
using micro USB for
charging so that's a bit of that's a bit
of a departure they include a microfiber
cloth with the unit which is very handy
because you will probably want to clean
it at some point as well as a QuickStart
guide for how to use Windows 8 so
setting up for the first time the
windows 8 lockscreen swiping in from the
right to get to the charms menu this is
super important as well as the windows
or modern or whatever UI they're calling
it now the UI formerly known as Metro
alright Adam inside it looks like oh no
I thought they got away without putting
the Adam sticker on the unit itself but
they did not it is on the unit once you
peel off the plastic covering you will
see that sorry this is just taking me a
little while to get out it's kind of
tricky there we go a sous does such a
great job of their tablets I mean
they're all gorgeous this one's super
light so it only weighs that looks like
the actual spec is 580 grams which is
very very respectable it has a little
bit more heft to it than some of the
than some of these super sort of ultra
lightweight tablets that I've
encountered in the past but it's
definitely not as heavy as something
like an iPad 3 the power button is
located up here on the top so I was just
pressing that to get it powered on so we
can start the startup process on the
back as well you can see oh look at that
they've handily labeled where the NFC
tap is going to take place because it's
something like a tablet if you were to
for example sync it to a Windows Phone
then it's looks not paying attention
there we go if you were to sync it to a
Windows Phone then it could become a
guessing game of where do I actually tap
it so they tell you so that you're going
to you're going to know without too much
difficulty on the side you find your
headphone jack as well as your volume up
and volume down on the bottom you find
absolutely nothing and then on the other
side you find your charging port as well
as a whoo is that what I think it is no
way to know for sure unless I can open
it uh-huh you know what we'll be back in
a moment that is what I thought it was
we've got HDMI in there as well as micro
SD expansion on this side and the time
we've been off camera I've also waited
for Windows 8 to boot up so you can see
that even though I selected a Bluth
during my set up it is actually by
signing in to my to my Windows Live
account or whatever they call it I used
to be passport what they call it now I
don't even remember whatever I signed
into my Microsoft account so now all of
a sudden my photos are showing up my
theme is correct and I can access my
SkyDrive and just generally sort of
there you go Facebook all that kind of
stuff that I have linked together so
things are pretty much good and unlike
Windows RT devices I can go I can use a
browser I can download any application
that I desire so I could go and search
for I don't know let's search for AA
cpu-z or something like that here so
keyboard CPU dash Z because that seems
like a cool application to run on a
tablet right CPU ID
I mean if you guys are familiar with the
concept of Windows RT versus Windows 8
and you probably don't need me to
explain this to you but I think it's
pretty cool anyway so let's do the 1.6
to setup version in English download now
it's actually pretty snappy overall I'm
really impressed with the web browsing
experience so far on this Atom processor
and we're gonna find out exactly which
happened processor it is I'd also love
for you guys to check out the viewing
angle on this IPS panel so I mean a
Seuss again they do such a great job
with their tablets of just well building
them well it's like how do you how do
you say it in a way other than that so
they use an IPS panel they use a good
quality overall fit and finish to the
device actually I didn't mention the
back has has a nice rubberized feel to
it so there's your there's your speaker
on the rear as well I don't think I
pointed that out before but it makes it
easy to hold on to I think they've also
found a good balance of sort of bezel to
screen here because it's just wide
enough for my thumb to sit here without
causing problems with touchscreen stuff
that I'm trying to do elsewhere causing
interference like if I had a thumb
sitting here and I tried to do other
things
ooh yeah we've caused problems all over
the place no I don't want to ask toolbar
next
install sure create a desktop icon that
should be fine and don't want to view
that so let's go ahead and go back to
how do I minimize everything I don't
even know yeah I should work nope let's
minimize it yeah there we go so let's go
ahead and try launching cpu-z
let's find out what kind of CPU we got
on here look at that they're including
their sonic master branding for the
onboard sound as well so it should be
slightly better onboard sound than you'd
normally get on a tablet so there we go
we have an Adam Z 27 60 at 1.8 gigahertz
with a core speed of 1792 two cores and
four threads with hyper-threading our
memory is two gigs and it doesn't
actually look like it picks up much
other information about it which is sort
of I guess par for the course
CPU Z's not really optimized for these
platforms anyway so there's a lot of
information that's missing but I think
that pretty much wraps it up what's the
advantage it's still a tablet it's still
super portable the battery life is more
like a tablet where they're quoting
eight plus hours of battery life which
is really awesome compared to previous
Intel processor powered tablets and you
be are able to actually install whatever
applications you want don't forget to
