products now they have the shield
portable which is kind of the
all-encompassing handheld version which
you can see linus review here or you can
see me making a ghetto version of it
here they have the shield tablet which
you can see linus review up here or
finally they have the shield console
which you can see by doing nothing if
you want to see a video on the zotac
hybrid cooled arctic storm
gently caress the like button down below
Corsair delivers real neck or nothing
with the new strafed mechanical keyboard
featuring genuine German made Cherry MX
switches click now to learn more
the shield Android TV console rocks the
beastmode NVIDIA Tegra x1 featuring an 8
core CPU with 4 cortex a 57 cores and 4
cortex a53 cores alongside a 256 Core
Maxwell GPU and 3 gigabytes of gddr5
that's computationally 2 times as
powerful as an Xbox 360 and six times
the RAM at considerably less power draw
meaning it's the first device to run
Android TV in 4k and you can play stuff
like Crysis 3 Borderlands the pre-sequel
telltale games wolf among us and Game of
Thrones half-life 2 war thunder which
has freaking cross-platform support doom
3 ''and many more natively just by
downloading them from the store and
while that's awesome and it plays all
these things impressively I didn't see
things like Witcher 3 or even
hearthstone on there for that matter so
what are your other options well right
off the bat you have game stream this
being a PC centric channel I suspect
that most of you will be able to start
game stream almost immediately if you
have an NVIDIA GPU what exactly is game
stream well Linus should have a tech
quickie episode on that coming soon so
it's stay tuned for that
but for now basically you can use the
power of your NVIDIA GPU equipped
computer to do all the heavy lifting
that comes with running a game and use
another device like the shield console
to recapture that output data from the
computer receive controller inputs from
you and display out to a screen this
allows you to play pretty much whatever
the hell PC game you want as long as
your computer can play it but requires
the use of your computer and another
device like the shield console and you
must have a strong network link between
them if you don't want to use your other
computer or maybe don't have another
computer that can support this you have
the grid option which is essentially
where Nvidia uses their cloud setup to
act as your computer and honestly it
works pretty great but you need to have
a very good connection to support it and
it will chomp through your bandwidth
limit if you have one a connection speed
of 5 to 15
megabits per second will get you 720p
30fps and a connection speed of 15 and
above will get you 1080p 60fps now game
stream is free if you have the hardware
for it and the currently still in beta
grit option is a paid service after July
31st 2015 so keep that in mind as of
right now they have about 45 games
available which while it may sound like
a lot is a little lacking in actuality
in the future they will be an option of
the grid store where you can buy new
games right as they come out but we're
still waiting to see the cost structure
behind these things the aisle on the
back of the unit is a micro SD card slot
micro USB to USB 3.0 ports and Ethernet
jack HDMI and power speaking of which
you can use those ports to expand your
storage with micro SD cards or external
hard drives and you will probably want
to do this unless you get the 500
gigabyte model as the 16 gigabyte model
fills up quite quickly now if you're
someone who cares about aesthetics damn
you're in good hands this thing looks
really nice the aggressively angled
panels of mixed black plastic and
brushed aluminum looks amazing pretty
much wherever you put it and the subtle
green LED lighting looks perfect in my
opinion but can be controlled in the
software just in case it isn't really
your thing and it doesn't stop there if
you spring for the additional stand you
get treated to pretty much the same with
really sharp looking brushed aluminum
all around it which while it makes me a
little paranoid about fingerprints it's
mostly ok as it will pretty much just
sit there and look nice and you don't
really need to do much with it on the
bottom there's one of the stickiest
rubbery surfaces I've ever dealt with
which means if you kind of bump into it
or accidentally try to put something in
the way it's not really going to move
which is kind of nice the remote is a
thing of beauty as well but to be honest
it just plain scares the out of me
Nvidia clearly loves brushed aluminum
and like that's cool that's cool I'm
happy you guys want to put quality
materials onto your products and I hate
hammering on you for it but guy can't
even use the thing I get sweaty hands
and the brushed aluminum that's on the
back and front of this product would
just look like garbage after a while of
me using it so I've resorted to using
the foam packaging that
comes in right out of the box if you
want to see review of the controller
that comes with it click here to see
Linus cover it in the shield tablet
review that annotation should be
time-stamped but we're not even
necessarily a hundred percent sure if
that even works so if it isn't just
jumped to 2 minutes and 45 seconds
in conclusion this thing's sick the
controller alone is badass and cost
about $60 tack on another 140 and you
get a 4k capable chromecast essentially
without those overheating issues and
stuff that people have been having with
them and a surprisingly extremely
capable gaming machine which has the
ability to tap into the power of your
gaming rig or the Nvidia grid which is
very awesome should you rush out and buy
one obviously only if it would benefit
your setup by adding this into the
ecosystem but I do think that this thing
is seriously cool and if you have the
budget for it it could be a great
addition now I'm always saying that Nast
Rob you know the site where you go and
they've got like stuff and if a lot of
people agree to buy it you know the
community is like yeah we want to buy
one of those and mash tops like ok we'll
try and find one and then if a bunch of
other people like hey well I want to buy
it too the price goes down that's how
the whole thing works I'm always saying
they have a wide variety of things
available
lots of keyboards lots of you know
monitors even things like knives well
today's something that we've never
talked about before the feature drop
today is an AE EAP 10 HD drone it
features a high voltage battery it
actually has a maximum flight time of
somewhere in the neighborhood of 25
minutes
it reaches a max all to do to 500 meters
although you're going to want to check
your local regulations in case you
that's too high for regulations and can
capture both 16 megapixel stills as well
as 1080p high-definition video ok Linus
that's great there's a lot of drones
that do that what's special about this
one well the fact that it's available
for five 99.99 at its lowest drops you
guys are gonna want to head over to draw
ups slash Linus tech tips and get all
the deets about this drop and many more
join up at mass drop and you'll start
spending money I know that doesn't
necessarily sound like a solid pitch for
you guys the viewer but it's good
because you actually save money
me on the like cool gadget tree and neat
stuff that they've got over there so
check it out
shop around a bit see if you find
something I know that I usually do
