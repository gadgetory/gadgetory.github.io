look at the grand Papa of all of the
gigabyte x58 motherboard so this is the
brand-new
x58 a UD 7 now it was originally going
to be called the x58 u extreme - sorry
not UD anything extreme - when they were
first talking about this product but
since then they've actually changed the
naming scheme a little bit they've done
away with the extreme boards and they've
gone with an A now a denotes their new
updated X 58 and p55 boards and the
biggest features that you're going to
see all these boards are their three
three three on board accelerators so
that stands for USB 3.0 so that's a
brand new USB standard that runs at five
megabit gigabit per second sorry excuse
me megabit okay there's a USB power
times three now what that means is that
your USB ports on this board are all
running at three times the power spec
that USB actually calls for so that
means that if you're running a hub like
an unpowered hub you can actually run
three full powered devices off that hub
using just one of these parts because of
the way gigabyte has over built those
ports very cool and we've also got Sega
3.0 which technically isn't say a
three-point always say that six gaben
per second rather than say the three
gigabit per second so there's a little
bit of confusion there but you get the
point also a three year warranty it's
sli ready crossfire ready it's ready for
pretty much everything so this board
comes with everything except the kitchen
sink in fact you could even argue the
water cooling integrated on it could be
sort of like a kitchen sink so it comes
with three eighths inch Barb's for water
cooling there's a whole bunch of marking
spiel in there 24 phase power that's
another improvement they made over the
s50 in extreme which was definitely an
awesome x58 or it actually had one I
used for quite a while before I replaced
it for aesthetic reasons because
although gigabyte makes awesome boards
sometimes the look is not always what
you're going for in a particular
okay so let's get this board open here
you comes in like a nice white box and
then you can see that our okay first we
have a plastic shell plastic shell comes
ok plastic shell lock and then we have
you know what let's do the accessories
first okay accessory box so inside the
accessory box I have you say the back
panel
I have molex to SATA adapter and I have
an eSATA a couple eSATA cables okay
that's kind of neat okay and then next I
have four SATA cables and an IDE cable
okay next I have the Dolby Digital home
theater sticker awesome next I have a
3-way SLI bridge just in case we want to
run 3-way SLI on this board io shield
this I don't know what it is but it has
holes for ventilation and it seems to be
some kind of brace so yeah then we have
a regular SLI bridge now remember this
is a crossfire ready board and it
doesn't come up with a crossfire bridge
because crossfire already video cards it
should come with the crossfire bridge
okay then we've got a little gigabyte
sticker
did you gigabyte manual including the
driver CD you don't use the driver CD
download the latest drivers off the
manufacturer website multilingual
installation guidebook awesome and then
you have their smart six users manual
okay next thing we've got is the
heatsink shouldn't be using this thing
it's like totally overkill but I guess
if you're buying the extreme board you
might as well so it's a heat pipe cooler
that actually straps on to the board
right here and then mounts into a PCI
slot so you can use all of this huge
thin array for cooling the the chipset
and the MOSFETs and the chips down here
so now let's get to the board itself so
wow that's a heavy board as with all x58
boards you have support for triple
channel memory so this particular board
supports up to 24 gigs of triple channel
memory you can see all around here is
all of our 24 phases of power for your
da 1366 socket now this is a lote socket
which seems to matter these days because
there was an issue with some of the
Foxconn sockets a little while back all
right so we've got our power connectors
in their usual places 8 pin up here 24
pin down here now this is where it
starts to get interesting here on the
side we have 6 SATA 2 ports so SATA 3
gigabit per second and for say that 6
gigabit per second or SATA 3 ports now
the original extreme Ward was supposed
to include these but they ended up
having to sub it for something else
because the standard wasn't quite ready
but now here they are and all of their
glory and okay yeah we've got our 3 PCI
Express 16x slots you know these are the
right ones because these are the ones
that are spaced for tri SLI ok so that
means you still got access to a couple
PCI Express 1x slots up here at the top
now over here is the back panel now the
blue ones those are your USB 3.0 ports
as far as I know the other ones are just
color-coded for no particular reason you
got 7.1 audio 2 Gigabit Ethernet so 6
USB 2.0 2 USB 3.0 a couple firewire
ports clear CMOS button that is so handy
then you've got a couple of digital
audio and a couple ps2 ports there's the
back of the board nothing exceptional
there I love to see metal braces for
anything from the front of the board
because it means that they're not
cheaping out using plastic thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the x58 a UD
