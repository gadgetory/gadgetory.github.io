promise you guys some follow-up videos
about the GX 660 are from MSI so this is
my first series of follow-up videos and
I'm just gonna show you guys the touch
sensitive buttons here at the top of the
laptop and what a couple of my favorite
ones do I mean first of all there's the
one that I hate which is the wireless
button which because it's only a visual
indicator a light whether it's on or off
I turn off my wireless on a fairly
regular basis we got one of those for
Bluetooth we got one of those for Eco
mode as well so you can see that's going
to change from eco mode to movie mode to
gaming mode to presentation mode to
office mode to turbo battery mode and
off so that's pretty neat little thing I
actually don't know what this one does
what happens if I press that okay well I
don't know what that one does yet okay
this one don't over what that does here
these are my favorites though these are
the ones I actually care about so check
this up okay so our core speed is 931
megahertz I'm gonna turn on prime95 and
you're gonna see the course B is going
to jump up 21.86 to gigahertz okay now
check this out check this out I'm gonna
press the turbo button BAM
turbo on okay so first it went down and
now goes up one point nine five five
gigahertz so it actually overclocked the
bus speed not the multiplier so this is
a one touch overclocking button that
actually doesn't affect intel speedstep
it doesn't affect turbo boost
so here watch this if I take my prime95
and I stop it and then I do for example
a single-threaded small FFT single
thread so if I stress a single core
you're gonna see that my clock speed is
going to be been two point six five two
gigahertz
whereas if I turn turbo off so I'm gonna
press the turbo button again and it's
gonna go back down until speed step is
enabled and wait is that the same no
that's not the same that's less
excellent so that was what I was trying
to demonstrate now here's another cool
feature
this is the OMG the laptop is noisy
button listen
slowly ramps up but basically this is
like a turbo cooling mode for the laptop
that allows you to if you're if you know
you're gonna be doing something
intensive you don't have like a laptop
cooling pad available you want to make
sure that everything is going to stay
running nice and cool well that's one
way that you can make sure that it is
going to be running as cool as possible
regardless of what you are doing with it
if you're running a game if you're
running anything else doesn't really
matter so here we've got prime95 on
you're gonna open up my I actually don't
know if my copy of real temp is going to
work on this CPU so I guess we'll find
out and it does so even running quad
instances of prime95 on this quad core
eight thread processor we're not getting
above 70 degrees which is pretty darn
respectable for a notebook that is
overclocked cool beans thanks for
checking out Linus tech tips don't
forget to subscribe and that would make
me happy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
