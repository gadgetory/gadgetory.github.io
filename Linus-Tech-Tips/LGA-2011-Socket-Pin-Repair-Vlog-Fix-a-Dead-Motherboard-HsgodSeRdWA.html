welcome to a bit of an impromptu
late-night vlog I've got a core i7 for
third something K whatever the point is
it's an LGA 2011 chip here that is
perfectly good but unfortunately isn't
booting in this X 79 to lock a soos
board and it's not the fault of the
board somehow at some point I hope you
guys can see it here right there there
is a vent pin now the advantage to LGA
chips is that the CPUs themselves are
much less fragile than they used to be
but back when pins are on the bottom of
CPUs or on AMD CPUs where they still are
it was a lot easier to repair them and
you can even use little tricks like
putting the stub of the pin or even
another piece of metal into a socket and
as long as it would make contact a lot
of the time you could get your CPU
working again well LGA 2011 repair is a
lot trickier so we're going to give it a
shot here let's see how much I can zoom
in and show you guys that damaged block
right in the middle of the frame there
there's one pin that's either broken or
bent it's hard for me to even tell so
I've got my tools handy here first up is
a standard pin or needle you're going to
want one that's reasonably fine okay I
got a pink one second is you're going to
want some kind of a magnifying glass so
you can actually see what you're doing
and then third is you are going to want
an excellent light source so in my case
I'll be going
an iPhone propped up between the PCI
slot slots so here we go now the way
these pins work is they're kind of like
little Springs so here you can see that
they actually have a flat portion we're
going to see if I can even get in there
goopy goopy goop they have kind of a
flat portion here at the bottom and then
they end in a little ball at the end now
it looks like what's happened to our pin
here after closer examination with the
magnifying glass is the ball on the end
has broken off but that doesn't mean
that it's necessarily done for we may be
able to bend the pan back into a
position where the rest of it so not the
pad at the end but the rest of it the
stump of it can make contact with the
pad on the bottom of the CPU so that's
going to be our goal here so what we're
going to do is we're going to use very
delicately this pin being careful not to
damage the ones around it mind you if we
do it's a dead board already although I
think a soos can do soccer repair for a
fee but this is an engineering sample
board so there's no warranty so we're
just going to kind of go for the gusto
here and we're going to try to bend that
pin into such a position that it can
make contact with its corresponding pad
on the bottom of the CPU here so I think
I got it by because the the pin has a
couple of kinks in it so it kind of goes
this way and then back and then up to
the head so what I did was because we're
missing the head now is I I bent it up
and then I bent this one up a little bit
so hopefully that stub of the pin is now
in the same position where the head
would have been so it can make contact
now you can see it still looks a little
funny but the only way to know for sure
unfortunately is to fire up a CPU and
find out if she posts now this isn't the
kind of thing that I actually recommend
doing
because I have no way of guaranteeing
that you wouldn't kill your CPU by doing
it but hey there's Linus tech tips so
we'd like to live dangerously all right
so it's a moment of truth time I've gone
ahead and built up a test bench here
hopefully I wired it all up correctly
let's just see what happens
okay there we go so it is powering up
but this was normal we expected that
let's see if we get anything on the
display
no way ah got it
look at that core i7 49 30k you CPU
installed it worked we got it well there
you go guys
as as ghetto as the methodology may have
been that is how I go about fixing pins
on LGA sockets I've actually done it a
number of times this one I had already
worked on for about 15 minutes before I
tried it tonight but that was when I had
a much thicker pin and I also didn't
really have a great light source I
didn't have a magnifying glass so I was
able to do a bit of a better job this
time
and we've got it up and running so
that's fantastic salvaged a motherboard
$300 motherboard sure beats sure beats
buying any one so thanks for watching
