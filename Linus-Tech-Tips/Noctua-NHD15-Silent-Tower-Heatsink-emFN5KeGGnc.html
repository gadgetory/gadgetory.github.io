years as one of if not the king of the
castle for dual Tower heat sinks but
Noctua hasn't been sitting on their
thumbs and finally we have a successor
the NHD 15 is here for the ultimate no
compromises compact gaming PC look no
further than the obsidian series 250d
from Corsair click now to learn more now
to fans of previous Noctua products the
family resemblance between the D 14 and
the D 15 will be fairly obvious they
both feature six heat pipes soldered
onto a flat shiny base they both feature
two large towers with stacked aluminum
fins and they are both intended to run
in a dual fan configuration with high
quality fans included in the box
in this case static pressure optimized
NF a 15 140 millimeter pwm fans with
integrated anti vibration mounts and
they are both capable of mounting a
third aftermarket fan for even better
performance when we look closer though
we start to notice some differences
first up is that the fin stacks have
been widened this allows the six heat
pipes to have more spacing between them
for better efficiency next we see that
the bottoms of the fin stacks have
actually been cut away for better memory
compatibility this gives you a ton of
options you can populate both sides with
fans and low profile RAM you can
populate the center with a fan and put
high profile RAM on both sides of the
duel tower heatsink something I've never
seen before or you can throw two fans in
and have high profile RAM on one side
one last option is that you can actually
raise the outside fan if you need a
little bit more space for RAM just make
sure your side panel is far enough away
from your motherboard for this to work
because it's going to stick up above the
top of the heatsink inside the box aside
from the high quality included fans with
their 6 year warranty you'll find low
noise adapters for the fans that reduce
them from 1500 to 1200 rpm a Wye cable
so that both fans can be PWM controlled
off of a single motherboard header a
tube of nth one thermal
pound and knock to us legendary that's
not as exciting as I thought
legendary sec you firm to mounting
hardware which their renowned not only
for creating but also for upgrading for
free for existing customers when new
sockets come out with only a couple of
exceptions not too as mounting hardware
is so much better than everyone else's
that for once I really do wish that
everyone would just copy their design so
the entire industry could have better
mounting hardware okay so I guess all
that's really left at this point is how
does it actually perform I will leave
that to loop to cover you will be
putting the NHD 15 up against the very
best all-in-one liquid coolers on the
market for at a battle royale of top end
air cooling versus top and liquid
cooling and I think that you guys will
be impressed by the results spoiler
alert I'm still a knock to a fanboy
alright guys so for the test environment
we have a 48 20 K running at one point
three volts at a speed of 4.0 gigahertz
we also have a GTX 580 in there
overclocked a little bit running
combustor to see heat up the place on
the CPU we run prime95 to heat up
everything there so that this is a very
stressful environment and we're testing
the cooler while under load in a really
harsh kind of above the top situation we
also have a c7 t as our standard test
bench in case we run all of our coolers
in this case and that's what this one
was done in as well in terms of mounting
the cooler with knocked with sucky firm
two mounting hardware it's pretty
freaking easy judging by the size of the
cooler you expect it's going to be
really difficult but once you mount the
anchor points in and with the custom
screwdriver that they give you it's it's
honestly a breeze I had no complications
installing this cooler at all in terms
of noise levels it did great but then
everything we test here does great
because we standardize on Noctua fans
all the other coolers we test get a nice
little advantage because we add value by
adding aftermarket fans to their cooling
setups these aren't after markets and
fans for Noctua because they're not to a
fans the exact ones that we're testing
with are the ones that come in the box
because they're the exact same model
before I jump into performance I would
highly suggest opening a new tab
closing this one checking out tech
quickie and watching Linus's video on
liquid cooling radiators it's a really
good watch and will help inform you
about a few things about liquid cooling
if you do know about it continue on
watching and we'll talk about
performance so the NH dash D 15 performs
really well I was kind of surprised that
it beat an H 110 although that being
said knock two has been sitting on this
for a really long time so I was kind of
expecting excellence from them it
doesn't beat it by a lot though so it's
an interesting kind of trade-off if you
need that being able to put it somewhere
else in the case because you're worried
about sizing because this cooler is
fairly tall maybe you need an a IO but
if you're not worried about that maybe
you're a little bit scared of liquid
being in your case maybe this is the way
you go let me know what you guys think
in the comments down below and I'll see
you guys next time
speaking of silent performance
audible.com actually I have no idea if
Luke said anything about silence or
performance because I'm shooting this
before he does his part but I'm not too
worried about it anyway my segways
rarely make much sense anyhow so you've
likely heard of audible.com if you've
been on the internet but it's very
possible that you haven't heard of their
monthly audiobook service that you can
join to get a new audiobook to listen to
every month I jumped the gun a little
bit and even though my son is only 2 as
of today happy birthday I grabbed a
wrinkle in time by Madeleine L'Engle for
re-listen before I do the whole series
with my son when he's a little bit older
it's great for kids and adults and I
highly recommend it but if you want
something else then you can of course
pick out whatever you want from their
selection of over 150,000 titles and the
first one is a hundred percent free when
you sign up so try it out and make sure
you use the URL audible.com slash Linus
so they know who sent you thanks for
watching guys the link for where to buy
this product is in the video description
below the like dislike and share buttons
which I'm not sure where they are but
you should use them accordingly also in
the video description is a support link
that we'd love for you to use if you
appreciate what we do you can get a
