unboxing of Anna soos LCD monitor this
is an ultra slim model the ms2 36h and
there's not a whole lot you can tell
about it from the outside of the box so
I'm gonna go ahead and just start
getting this guy opened up here you can
see that the box is in like 300 million
different languages so that's useful you
can put this on display in a store no
matter what country you happen to be in
okay get this box open it up I don't
remember if I mentioned already but this
is an ultra slim model maybe the camera
man can indicate to me whether I said
that already yeah apparently I didn't
say that already so basically all we're
gonna do today is we're gonna unbox this
thing get it set up and then plug it
into the soos notebook that I unbox the
other day so I just took out the panel I
can already tell it's very thin
accessories so the first thing we find
on the bottom side of this phone is this
huh
we'll figure that out in a minute okay
the other things we find inside are a
power brick so because it's so slim they
actually were not able to build the
power adapter for the monitor into the
panel so it just has it's a small tiny
power brick I mean this thing is no big
deal
2.1 amps 19 volts and then you've got an
adapter cord for them and then included
cables they've got an HDMI to DVI cable
that is smart you know what I really
appreciate this because very few people
have DVI out on their computers these
days and since it's an HDMI IN I mean
the signal is the same there's no
disadvantage to adapting DVI to HDMI
versus using native DVI or native HDMI
so including a cable like this allows
them to save whatever they save by not
integrating a DVI port and it still
gives you the convenience of being able
to plug in to DVI on your computer
awesome next we have a VGA cable this
your bog-standard
blue vga cable okay so we're on a
question now to figure out what this
thing is I've never seen something quite
like that before but I'm hoping that
once I get the monitor out of the bag it
will become apparent what that is okay
so the first thing you notice is this is
as advertised very very slim so it's
only about the width of my finger and
it's very very light as well and so you
can see LAN why don't we start at the
bet actually let's start at the top so
at the top you got some ventilation
holes so that's gonna keep the the
excess heat coming off of the light and
the other electronics under control and
then why don't we move around to the
back where we have what appears to be
the mount for the skin so I'm gonna go
ahead and assume that this is something
to do with the stand for this monitor
although I would be lying if I said I
could figure out just how it works
oh hopefully I didn't break it okay so
this plugs in
goes in here okay that goes there and
then you screw this in okay so that's
getting much tighter now I think we're
there okay and then this which I thought
I broke but it looks like I didn't goes
there if that is that really how it
mounts yeah okay well mystery solved
that is how to mount the monitor okay
great well why don't I grab the power
cord we'll hook this thing up and have a
look I thought I've gone crazy there and
I didn't I thought maybe it was like a
ring that goes between the monitor and
the standard something like that but no
no that's the stance very creative
definitely something different you know
if you want to monitor with a different
looking stand then you can get this one
okay
let's plug into the power get this
plugged in actually let's go let's have
a look at the front first okay so this
is a 23 inch monitor and it has a 1920
by 1080 resolution so that means that it
is HD so 16 by 9 aspect ratio some of
these protective stickers here so you
can see a soos is using a highly glossy
finish for this monitor which as long as
you don't touch it is definitely very
very very nice-looking
and although the screen itself uses a
matte finish anti reflective finish so
personally I really prefer that you
don't get the same vibrance that you get
with your colors as you do with a Blasi
screen but you do get more accuracy with
the colors and you also usually the ones
that have the matte screen tend to be
higher quality panels is my
so touch-sensitive button right there
and then all of the buttons for the
adjustments overruns on this side here
are touch sensitive so that's pretty
cool so why don't we hit the menu button
and let me see how does this work okay
so if I touch that do I hold that hmm
interesting so if I press menu what
happens
maybe the button is below or above hmm
well why don't we have a look at the
back of the monitor first and then we'll
figure that out later
I haven't actually shown you all of the
input options yet so around the back
we've got our power input then we have a
Kensington lock so you can secure your
monitor if you're in an office
environment or you need to secure your
monitor then you have HDMI in VGA in and
headphones for HDMI that's pretty cool
okay so just plug this into the computer
that I have running in the background
here this is the assist gaming notebook
that we unbox the other day and I'll
plug that into the HDMI port and
hopefully it's gonna be pretty
straightforward to get this thing
running okay yeah it's detected and
we're going to press that and there we
go
I think hmm monitor is on soos logo and
I'm gonna press the begin and it says
VGA no signal so maybe what we have to
do is select a different source HDMI VGA
okay yeah the touch button is working so
that's type sensitive I've selected HDMI
input and there we go it is working that
was relatively straightforward let's see
if I can adjust the brightness a little
bit here so brightness oh oh cool okay
so it's got a few different presets so
you got standard mode theater mode
gaming mode which basically turns up the
gamma night-you mode scenary mode and
standard mode menu button seems to be
working now which is much much improved
aiming thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the MS 23 6h</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
