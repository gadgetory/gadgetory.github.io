kind of person who takes cybersecurity
super-cereal you use a password manager
with multi-factor everything you keep
all your programs and operating systems
up to date and you're constantly keeping
a vigilant eye out phishing attacks that
is all really good stuff that we should
actually all do but none of it will do
you a bit of good if an attacker
actually gets your hardware in their
hands like physically that is unless
you're using a tamper-proof Orwell
computer from design shift a PC that
needs a password and a fob just to boot
up and that apparently will disable
itself permanently if we mess with it

of challenges this was a challenging

out now at the link in the video
description
named for George Orwell every one of
these tiny yet shockingly heavy little
machines has its own unique encryption
key one that is totally unknown even to
the manufacturer design shift it's a
time rotating RSA 4096 key so that is
over 4,000 bits long and what it means
is that it is practically impossible to
brute force so for reference the largest
RSA number that's ever been factored was
only 768 bits long and that took
hundreds of computers over 2 years to
figure out now this encryption key is
not stored in main memory or on the self
encrypting SSD but rather in a security
microcontroller that only exposes it
briefly
when a user is authenticated like as
you're booting up as for how to
authenticate well two-factor of course
or ball comes with two special key fobs
that must be scanned on the machine
before you'll even be prompted to enter
your numeric password using Orwell's
OLED display and only then does the
Machine boot up and then you will still
need to enter credentials for Windows
Ubuntu cubes OS or whatever your fobs
use NFC for the initial setup then once
they're paired the Java card applet on
the fob that's responsible for pairing
is actually deleted and from then on the
fobs communicate their distance from or
well over encrypted low-energy Bluetooth
and the machine will actually lock down
if you get more than 10 meters away in
lockdown mode
Orwell's ports that's two five gigabit
USB type C's for power and peripherals
and a mini HDMI for the display are shut
off so no one can plug in their Stuxnet
flash drive or boot the computer using
an external device and the CPU is put to
sleep that is unless the mainboard
secure MC use three axis accelerometer
and gyroscopes detect movement at which
time it will actually be powered
completely off forcing a potential
hacker to build their lab a
around the Machine rather than carrying
it away to be prodded at in privacy
okay then Linus what if I go around the
MCU by freezing it with a spray
refrigerant ha well since the MCU also
monitors for drastic temperature changes
freezing it will actually result in
Orwell destroying the encryption key and
even if you could freeze the RAM for
example which typically retains
information for a few seconds after
being powered down you'd have a hard
time reading anything from it because it
is soldered on to the board and going at
it the other way isn't an option either
the boot sequence is designed to wipe
the RAM before post to prevent attackers
from somehow inserting code into the
memory during boot I mean most of that
stuff though is kind of hypothetical
anyway because you probably would never
get that far the entire system is
physically tamper proof and I'm not
talking about a handful of pressure
sensors that you can just drill holes
around and disable no no the entire
system in addition to the mainboard MCU
and the MCU and the FOB the system is
wrapped in a conductive dye shield with
multiple pressure switches and a wire
mesh barrier this protects against
physical ingress and certain
side-channel attacks like over-the-air
power analysis since no meaningful power
leakage will make it through the die
shield and if you disturb any of that
stuff the encryption key gets Newt and
all of this works even without Orwell
being plugged in since the main board
MCU is onboard battery can actually last
for several months now to be clear
security features like this have been
around for years in some industries but
design shifts pitch is that they're
delivering Bank level information
security for everyone without changing
the overall user experience and they're
actually mostly there the fobs are a
little too bulky right now in my opinion
and while they are rechargeable over
microUSB they lack a battery indicator
light so when they die in your Orwell
locks down you're gonna have a bad
but once you're logged into Orwell it
behaves just like a regular computer as
advertised so that's really cool but I
still think their audience will end up
being somewhat limited the Orwell
breezed through our thermal tests
staying relatively quiet without
throttling but even the top tier model
sticks you with a mobile processor eight
gigs of RAM and integrated graphics and
that's at three times the cost of a
similarly Specht tablet computer to be
clear that could be considered cheap
compared to some of the other options
that are out there and there are
definitely going to be customers for
this tech but I just have to wonder if
the next step for design shift has to be
a notebook to give extra flexibility to
anyone who wants to take his or her
secure computing on the road
alright then with all that out of the
way let's see if we can lose our data
