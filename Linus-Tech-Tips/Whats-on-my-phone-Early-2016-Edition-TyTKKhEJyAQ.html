requests to do youtuber things like
drawing my life for a top 5 of insert
whatever it is here Harlem shake
reading hate mail twerking or whatever
else and for the most part I've avoided
that stuff because it never really felt
relevant to the core content of this
channel but the one thing I can no
longer justify having never done is a
what's on my phone so I decided that it
was long overdue and also I am full of
Turkey and needed something easy to do
today
so first things first a lot of you have
noticed in my phone reviews that I
usually have a ton of notifications
piled up on my lockscreen and the truth
is I have just given up fighting this
battle I don't even bother clearing them
anymore because there's just too much to
unlock I use the trusted device feature
of Android so as long as my paired
SmartWatch is nearby my phone will
actually unlock without my fingerprint
or my password it's super handy in
between that and being able to ring my
phone if I misplace it from my watch
honestly the whole SmartWatch thing has
been worth its weight in gold for me on
the main home screen you'll find pretty
much I guess the usual stuff right and
unchanged desktop wallpaper ain't nobody
got time for that
a repositioned but otherwise stock
search bar on the top with Google now a
weather widget that also tells me what
day of the week it is and the time if
for whatever reason I'm not wearing my
watch and what I like to think is a
pretty well-organized desktop the top
left spot the furthest from my right
handed operation of the phone is
reserved for a single temporary use app
of some sort so that's the screen
recording app that I'm using to make
this video and I'll delete that when I'm
done next to that is my alarms and the
first thing you'll notice here is that
I'm not an early riser which is why I
made Linus Media Group's start time 9:30
in the morning and I'm usually 15 to 20
minutes late anyway the only days where
I actually get up early are the ones
where I have to get the kids ready in
the morning the next two apps are for
access control and for spying on the
employees to see who left pee spots on
the floor of the bathroom or used up all
the paper towel in the kitchen without
putting a new role on the Google Play
Store gets its own link with utilities
next to that here you'll find anything I
use fairly frequently that doesn't fall
nicely into any of the other categories
I am a huge fan of SoundHound and have
been known to excuse myself in crowded
restaurants so I can get a clean
recording of a song on the speaker in
the bathroom where it's quieter Wi-Fi
analyzer is great for checking out which
channels are crowded so you can avoid
them for better wireless performance the
Android wear companion app lets you
change settings for your Android wear
smart
if you're into that sort of thing I
mostly leave mine stock and LastPass and
Google Authenticator along with a UV key
which I featured in this video here make
up the layers of security that sit
overtop of Linus Media Group's important
accounts now I'm not issuing a challenge
no system is perfect but logging into a
key company asset would require up to
four authentication factors the media
folder is pretty self-explanatory so if
you don't know what YouTube is then the
rock that you're living under must be
really really comfortable photos I
really never use since I always manage
photos on my desktop Google Play Music
is pretty much the soundtrack of my life
so that along with Sonos keeps my house
full of music and my one-year-old
dancing back and forth like this vessel
is the early access video platform that
we release our content on one week
before YouTube now Amit is an
interesting one this is the Android
equivalent to air video on iOS I guess
except kind of crappier
unlike Plex you don't have to pay a
monthly fee for remote access to your
media files though which is nice I'm a
believer that whatever the legal system
thinks if I pay for a DVD of something I
should be allowed to rip it and serve it
to myself for personal use and no one
but me has access to my Amit server so
there you go that's how I access my
media library when I'm on Android
VLC handles playback of any video files
I download directly to my phone it just
works and plex I've been playing around
with but haven't actually bit the bullet
yet on a subscription or the paid app
because while it's pretty slick a
monthly fee is a hard pill for me to
swallow for streaming media remotely
that I already own under social is the
much consolidated list of wealth social
apps that I use Twitter is a daily
pretty much hourly access app hangouts
is almost my exclusive messaging app
these days since switching to it is a
requirement to work at Linus Media Group
and I've even got my dad on it at this
point the YouTube studio app is great it
lets me read video comments and see
stats and a handy little dashboard that
I only used to have access to on the
desktop YouTube site and Facebook
honest
they I almost never look at I'm not much
of a social-media poster other than for
work and now that you can't message
through the main Facebook app and the
messenger app drains the crap out of my
battery for some reason last time I
installed it this is here pretty much
solely to delete the LAN show is now
live post that we put up every week so
that people don't get confess old
periscope I keep telling myself I'm
gonna use it more I'm gonna use it more
but I never end up doing it it's
actually really fun to do I just I don't
know I just can't I'm usually busy and
then Instagram gets dealt with whenever
I open up this folder to post something
on Twitter and then remember oh I should
probably post something to Instagram fun
fact by the way I follow zero people on
Instagram yep I don't care what photos
people post at all calendar is next and
that's on here for whenever I'm
desperate I guess my calendar is usually
much too complicated for any mobile app
to handle it gracefully and maps is here
so that I have something to stare at
angrily while old people tell me about
all the fascinating landmarks that I'm
gonna see on my way to just give me the
address already I don't care if there's
a sculpture on the northwest corner of
the intersection storage and docks has
got Dropbox for its seamless camera
backup feature and actually I've only
got a free account because honestly it's
enough for me to just dump my photos and
videos about once a month to my home
server and then start over Docs and
sheets let me keep track of and edit
things like my to-do list and the weekly
wine show document I know there are
better apps
particularly for checklists like
Evernote but I just find google docs
more versatile and I don't need to do
things like sketches for the kinds of
notes that I keep so it works really
really well for me at the bottom is the
stock dialer stock messaging app Gmail
for all my email needs and Chrome for
anything that I don't do from within an
app so right now I've got some super
micro 90 Drive server thing I was
scoping out but usually I just use this
to browse the Linus tech tips forum
hence the autocomplete suggestion my
second home screen has a bunch trash
that I never got around to removing and
my app drawer has anything that came
pre-installed on the phone or that I use
less than once a month like my
chromecast overall I guess
most interesting thing about my standard
phone loadout is how incredibly boring
it is I'm always trying to use more
advanced stuff like location-based
reminders in key for NFC tags but none
of that ever really sticks for me I'm
actually kind of a simple person as far
as phone use goes and with all this talk
of phones let's think for a minute what
if you were more of like a phone mobile
app developer and you needed a solution
for easy online payments boom Braintree
if you're building a mobile app and
searching for a simple solution for
taking people's money
Braintree could be it with the Braintree
v.0 SDK which is one small snippet of
code you can be all set up in less than
10 minutes and they even have support
staff to walk you through the process
over the phone if you're having any
trouble their code supports Android iOS
and JavaScript clients and they have
SDKs in seven programming languages with
Braintree you can accept multiple mobile
payment types including PayPal Apple pay
Bitcoin venmo cards and more all with
that single integration to learn more
and get your first $50,000 in
transactions without any fees whatsoever
