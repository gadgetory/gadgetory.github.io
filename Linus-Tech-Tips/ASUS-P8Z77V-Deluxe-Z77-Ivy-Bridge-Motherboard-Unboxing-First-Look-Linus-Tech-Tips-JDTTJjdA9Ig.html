the p8z 77v deluxe from Asus this
supports the latest Intel processors
that is to say second-generation core i3
Core i5 and core i7 processors on the
LGA 1155 platform and also supports at
the time of publishing this upcoming
Intel processor so that is 22 nanometer
codename Ivy Bridge third generation
Core i3 Core i5 and core i7 CPUs it also
has a bunch of other a specific
technology that will get more into as we
go along but let's start with their dual
intelligent processors 3 so that is a
third generation of that particular
initiative their EP you and TPU which
are dedicated processors allowing you to
either take advantage of the best power
efficiency or get the best performance
out of your system as well as their
eighth generation digital power design
which is now across the board
hah-ha board get it across the board on
their z77 chipset boards with this board
as sli ready it supports AMD processor
ex virtue MVP which gives you better
performance less tearing in high frame
rate scenarios as well as the
flexibility to plug into whatever port
you want and still take advantage of
Intel our Quick Sync technology next
we've got support for Smart Response
technology as well as Intel's and Asus
SSD caching so more on that in a moment
is Windows 7 ready and it sure is well
better be ultimate cooling quiet is
supported with their fan expert - I mean
ok they can call it ultimate cool and
quiet all they want but what it is is
actually cooler than that because you
can set fully custom fan curves user
user configurable fan curves according
to how you want your system to sound or
how you want your cooling performance to
go Wi-Fi go is included so this in this
particular board is a dual band solution
allowing you to not only sorry not only
use Wi-Fi but also Bluetooth it is a
DLNA server which is really really cool
so you can stream media to various
devices around your house as long as
they support DLNA
and it is also dual-band which means
that it's going to give you the best
performance
I mean mochi maybe not as good as like a
you know dedicated card but as good as
you could possibly expect from onboard
Wi-Fi on a motherboard smart DIGI+ okay
OSI performance boost okay we've got
more about their precise power control
so yes their high-end boards I mean
these days there's not as much logic
built on to a board anymore as there
used to be because we've gotten to the
point where the memory controller the
PCI Express controller are both built on
to the CPU itself so it's not really
left in the chipset anymore so what it
comes down to when you want the best
possible overclocking and you want to
choose the best possible motherboard now
is pretty much the quality of the
components that they're using so if you
really want to go you know balls to the
walls as far as overclocking goes I'd
still suggest you go with an AC stuff
series board or an ro G Series board but
if you want sort of all of those
consumer friendly features as well then
the P sorry the phd 77v deluxe is not a
bad choice either because you're going
to get that balanced approach and you're
not going to get that far out aesthetic
if you don't care about the red color
scheme or the like I mean here we have
the sabre-tooth board over here or like
the thermal armor kind of there there it
is thermal armor kind of coolness going
on then you can go with the more the
more mainstream oriented boards let me
just make sure I haven't missed any
major features before we get too much
further in so dual intelligent
processors three got it okay smart to do
Plus technology yep got it actually one
thing that's really cool about their new
digital vrm as well not really new
digital vrm but their new controls for
their digital DRM is that you can
actually set a power threshold for your
system and then it will dynamically
adjust the performance of your CPU
according to whatever you set so if
you're in something like an office
environment and you're deploying a ton
of systems you're probably not going to
be using deluxe level boards that the
good news is that is actually supported
on the lower end boards as well so you
can control the power that your systems
are consuming in your office very easily
USB BIOS flash back this is a fantastic
feature without a CPU or memory
installed you can easily just throw a
BIOS file on the USB
drive press the button and restore their
and recover your BIOS just like that
asus USB 3 boost technology means that
you can either use USB Attached scuzzy
or u asp to dramatically improve the
performance of supported USB 3 devices
so anything supports the USB Attached
Guzzi protocol bar sorry
no not everything supports the USB
Attached Guzzi protocol but everything
supports their standard minimal boost 1
which just doesn't use this the the
normal USB protocol UEFI bios this is
pretty much par for the course these
days and network I control so because
ACC is using intel lan across the board
haha did it again on their motherboards
for this generation of products come on
the I control functionality works on all
of them so that is that you can
prioritize various packets or various
programs according to how you how you
want the performance of them to go so
you can prioritize your games you can
deprioritize things like torrents or
whatever else you might have running in
the background that you don't want to
affect your gaming experience so let's
do accessories really quick here and
then we'll move on to the board itself
so we've got a user guide other more
different user guides so that's for
Wi-Fi bill that's for the board itself
that is your drivers and utilities DVD
download the latest from the Asus
website ok this board comes in HCI mode
on the SATA ports that is a very good
thing that means if you're running an
SSD you will get the maximum performance
out of the box without tuning anything
here we go dual been Wireless antennas
our dual band wireless network adapters
require 2 antennas so there is our Wi-Fi
go adapter so remember this guy is good
for Bluetooth as well as 802.11 a/b/g/n
and you've got your two spots there's an
plug in those antennas we have an i/o
shield front panel connector Assisting Q
connectors so this allows you to more
easily plug in your front power switch
and etc as well as one of your front USB
tubes we have an included sli bridge
remember your crossfire bridge should
come with your graphics card and then
three packages up SATA cables so for say
two three six gigabit per second cables
so those are all straight triangle
and to say two to three gigabit per
second cables and those are all straight
to right angle as well I'm actually just
going to shift around a little bit here
and here we go so you can see all the
various phases of digital power delivery
surrounding the LGA 1155 socket so that
as I mentioned before supports pretty
much any LGA 1155 CPU that you would
deem it fitting to put in it up here we
find our a pin power connector and it's
ideal location up at the top left we
find a Seuss's new vrm cooling design
which looks pretty slick it looks kind
of like like a you know a cityscape or
something along those lines we've also
got a heat pipe running all the way
through this one down to down to one of
the chipset coolers as well as we've got
our other chipset cooler which is using
a matching sort of aesthetic these
boards look really really good and if
you're like me then yes it matters
sorry guys I know I'm shallow we've got
for us for us between for ddr3 slots
supporting dual channel operation as
well as a memo K button that using that
button basically means that even if you
have high spec memory that doesn't
necessarily post correctly in any board
this should set you to a safe default
that will get it booted up so that you
can tweak it and get it to the right
settings there's our TPU button for
OneTouch overclocking although I would
definitely recommend if you want an easy
overclocking experience use the one in
AI suite because it will correctly tune
for your individual processor rather
than unnecessarily turning up the
voltage too high to get a lower clock
speed or not getting the most clock
speed possible out of the CPU that you
happen to have our 24 pin power
connector is in its ideal location along
the right-hand edge and we have a front
USB 3.0 header right about here that one
is going to be running off of the Intel
USB 3 chipset remember that four of the
USB 3 ports on this board are using an
Intel chipset and four of them are using
the as media chipset that supports you
ASP the Intel one does not at this time
alright moving down here we've got four
SATA to three gigabit per second ports
run when you're running off Intel the
Intel chipset to say two three six
gigabit per second ports running off the
Intel chipset and finally the SSD
caching port so these are running off of
a Marvel chipset
so a suggested usage scenario for
something like this is you have an SSD
for your boot drive you run that off the
Intel chipset for the best single drive
performance and then if you have like a
esteem drivers are like a games drive
something along those lines instead of
plugging that into a SATA 2 port you can
plug it into one of these ports and then
use a small SSD to cache your favorite
games so that they load a little bit
more quickly moving on down we have our
front panel connectors our TPU chip yes
it is an actual processor on the board
unlike many competing solutions we've
also got a post debugging led to USB to
front panel headers a clear CMOS button
I still like to have a dedicated button
for this rather than shorting out two
pins so that's nice to see a Thunderbolt
header so yes you can buy a an add-in
piece that goes right in here and plugs
into there and you can add thunderbolt
to any Asus z77 board except the ws one
there here's our EPU button for better
power efficiency as well as our front
panel audio header this right here is
very expensive that is a pcie 3.0 plx
PCI Express switching chip so that is
one of the unique things about the
deluxe level board is that it is able to
dynamically allocate the available PCIe
lanes because remember those are limited
due to the PCI Express controller being
on the CPU itself in order to give you
the best possible performance of all the
various features on the board no matter
what you have installed that's one of
the reasons we're able to have so many
PCIe slots on this board for PCIe 1x 3
PCIe 16x although this is only really
this is only really a 2-way SLI or
crossfire board so you only going to
really want to use these for that
because these are the ones that are
going to be running directly off the CPU
this one is going to be a little bit
slower as it has to there's there's more
overhead involved in this slot remember
guys though even if you're running 8 X 8
X mode with two high end cards
this is PCIe 3 so as long as you're
running PCIe 3 cards that is 79 70s 79
50s GTX 680 s then you will still be
getting the same bandwidth as pcie 2.0
16x moving along to the back of the
board we have four USB 2.0 ports six USB
3.0 ports two eSATA ports optical audio
out
hdmi and displayport out duel land one
of them being Intel Gigabit LAN USB BIOS
flash back button so that's the button
that you press when you have a USB
device plugged in in order to flash back
the BIOS as well as 7.1 audio out on the
back of the board we've got a couple of
little heat sinks here and let me just
see if there's anything crazy that I
might have missed before I get any
further lucid MVP talked about that ddr3
1600 megahertz J deck ah the fan control
curves slick says I didn't talk about
that I think I did though it's okay it
doesn't matter you can you can set
dynamically you can dynamically adjust
the fan curves in order to okay I don't
know what he's talking about something
about the ball yeah right fan fan
headers sorry guys so one two PWM four
pin fan headers three four five and six
so you can plug in pretty much as many
PWM fans as your heart desires and don't
