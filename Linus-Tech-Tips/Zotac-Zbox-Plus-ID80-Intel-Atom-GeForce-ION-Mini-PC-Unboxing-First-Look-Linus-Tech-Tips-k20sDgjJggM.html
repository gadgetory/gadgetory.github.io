at the zotac z box + idat this is a
creatively color scheme and see the blue
ring for the Intel Atom processor inside
versus the green ring on the ADL four
which is over there which has an AMD EPU
inside so this is a Adam as well as
GeForce ion solution which is very
similar otherwise to the other mini PC
so what we're going to do is on my NC ox
mci ox NCIX comm channel we're going to
take these guys head-to-head and find
out which one performs the best but for
now I still have to do the unboxing of
this so there's a bunch of stuff on the
outside of the box which we're basically
not going to concern ourselves with too
much other than the specs so it uses an
Intel Atom D 2700 so this is a new
generation dual-core at 2.1 3 gigahertz
with an Intel nm 10 Express chipset so
that means this is an older class GPU at
GT 520 with 512 Meg's of dedicated ddr3
memory it's using 2 gigs of RAM and a
320 GB hard drive although allsey boxes
are available as a completed PC so that
is one with memory and with a drive or
as a bare-bones so you can buy this I
bare-bones put an SSD in there you know
throw a bunch of RAM in there I think
it's got two slots so you should be able
to put up to eight gigs of memory yes so
you can do up to 8 gigs of memory in
here it includes Gigabit LAN 802.11 1
802.11 and Wi-Fi see I'm just off today
Bluetooth 3.0 SD card reader onboard 8
channel digital audio with stereo analog
audio out and the rest of this is stuff
that we will pretty much cover when we
open it up so inside we find some
manuals and accessories and driver discs
and warranty terms which is two years in
one year in the Americas two years in
the EU I believe that's by law driver
installation DVD which you're going to
want to not use and download the latest
stuff this attack or other manufacturer
website there's a user's manual with an
addendum for best compatibility please
use only the eSATA or USB
whereas the OS installation source they
are right USB this is not a unique issue
with ZOTAC but it's very difficult to
install an OS directly off of you a
bootable USB Drive on a USB 3 port
because a lot of them don't have the
drivers built in already Quick Start
Guide moving along we have a power
adapter with the other piece of said
power adapter
there's the DC converter go ahead throw
that guy back in there on the other side
we find a pretty wicked media remote
that is taped in pretty good and then
sealed in pretty good and then takes
batteries that look like that it comes
with the batteries by the way guys don't
worry don't be afraid of the scary
batteries that nobody has lying around
okay we've also got a DVI to VGA adapter
who's it or what's it I don't know what
this is oh okay there's our IR receiver
for the ability arm the built-in for the
included remote next we have a Wi-Fi
antenna whoops
there it's okay for screws and I'll more
on that later batteries and finally a
little plastic mounting piece that you
can use to prop up your Z box very
fashionably next we have the Z box unit
itself and it's gonna look kind of weird
I can tell you that guys know that is
your new mini PC yeah that does look
weird
I'll explain why that isn't justified
let's peel off some plastic one piece of
plastic
one switch to open it up he's foam to
keep it from getting all the scratch so
it looks all nice slick when you get it
okay and that is what the PC actually
looks like so this piece you use those
four included screws and you can
actually VESA mount your z box onto the
back of a compatible TV or monitor so it
includes a couple of different spacings
you just go ahead and you see this piece
right here you line that up with this
right here
just like back you clipper in and you're
done hopefully you've already screwed
the mounting clip to the back of the TV
otherwise you're gonna have no way to
screw it in you're gonna take your hand
off and the whole thing's gonna fall
down but as long as you do that first
and then clip it in then you should be
okay let's have a look at what we've got
in terms of i/o so we've got our power
button as well as activity LEDs for
wireless LAN as well as the drive front
USB to front SD card reader front
microphone as well as front headphones
on the top we have another USB 2.0 port
that's a handy place for that we have an
exhaust vent right here at the top of
the unit remember guys he does typically
rise so that is a good place for that as
well and intakes on the bottom once
again heat rises etc and that is a good
place for those as well one of the
things you'll probably notice as I show
you if you don't notice while I show you
then you're not doing very well here is
we can go ahead and put this in just
like that it sticks and your ZBOX sits
like that alternately mounting wise you
can use these rubber feet right there to
go ahead and take that and put it like
right there just like that
and that is the other way of mountings
mounting the ZBOX all right so the
bottom we're done oh yeah here's the
screws so here's to take it apart so you
can take it apart even if you buy one
that comes with the drive and comes with
red you can take it apart and change
them if you see fit remember z boxes do
not come with an OS so you will have to
procure an OS whether it's when you
already have or whether you violent in
place like say for example NCIX
and you can install it yourself or you
could pay a technician to do it but I
would recommend installing yourself it's
not that hard and I'm gonna try and put
this Wi-Fi antenna on here I'm trying
here there we go
BAM there we go we've also got two USB
3.0 SuperSpeed ports on the back two
more USB 2.0 ports so that is a total of
six USB ports one Gigabit Ethernet DVI
HDMI optical audio and power in so that
is a pretty full complement of
oh okay cooling time so there is the
cooling fan for the actual where the
bulk of the processing is going on
inside so you've got your intake here
you've got an intake here and then the
exhaust is going to be predominantly up
here so I think that pretty much covers
it guys stay tuned and don't forget to
subscribe to my NCI XCOM channel as well
so you can see our roundup our shoot out
our ultimate battle royale of the
somewhat less than Titans the mini pcs</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
