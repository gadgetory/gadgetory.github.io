there you want to make the video what's
that this Latino is a tablets the canno
computer kit touch and this is kind of
like the canno computer kit that you and
I built before but this time we touch it
that's right you guys want to help me
make it yeah please
and this video is sponsored by Ted oh
you guys aren't the sponsor all right
computer kick cut oh look
keyboard you know there's other words on
the box kit or lean meat 800k that's
French but there's other stuff to build
it yourself learn to code one
hundred-plus creative challenges make
art games music hack minecraft App Store
ages 6 and up wow so this is actually
quite a bit more okay alright alright so
this is the computer kit touch which is
kind of a significantly upgraded version
of the computer kit that I actually
built with this guy just about it must
have been about a year ago now at this
point but the promotion that they're
actually highlighting right now is for
the Harry Potter wand so that was one
that I did on my own but that thing is
really freaking cool so the one includes
full gesture control so you can actually
wave it around in order to execute
functions and includes 70 step-by-step
challenges to help you get familiar with
the world of coding in the world of
Wizarding so go check that out at the
link in the video description
it's $79.99 down from 99 for the holiday
season can you find me the screen in
here
well you've got to look for it what do
you think this is so is a keyboard
scream yeah this is scream I don't think
that's the screen oh are you gonna help
us take out the pieces are you just
gonna play with the phone oh you just
want more foam
whoa screen looks like it you wanna hold
it up and show YouTube so that's the
screen so every device with the
touchscreen what it has is it has all of
these wires in there and they're
invisible this is not the real wires
this is just a screen protector that has
the grid of the wires overlaid on it
okay so this comes off but under the
screen are real wires so what happens is
it detects when your finger touches or
swipes or Scrolls or whatever it is that
you want to do cool huh
so the idea last time was I was pretty
helpful this time
now that he can read so much better and
and now that he has such a helpful
assistant over here who is arranging
these phones in the box really nicely
for us I'm expecting him to mostly do it
himself okay so what else do we need
ready for the next page yeah maybe you
shouldn't have piled everything on top
of the book my friend goes right in that
tiny little slot there here yeah I think
you got it yep you're good that's it
because I'm just like that pick up screw
oh wow we go straight to the screen all
right you're gonna have to flip the
screen over already okay oh that's
different so this is the display
controller yeah that's the back of the
screen so inside all of your electronics
whether it's phones or laptops or
computers there's actually behind the
screen all these things that make them
work grab the cable
and put on me to snap it on to the
screen you are right this way keep your
cables organized you think cable
management is important watch cable
oh boy I have failed you as a father the
thousands of wire copper flips twisted
into nineteen fibers so inside here Oh
have you learned anything so far no no I
feel like you've learned something about
the brain or the screen controller no
face is protected Hey you could do
anything now no no I can't lift up the
office
you tried no oh wow
that's not bad how does it fly oh wow
that actually went that went better than
I expected to be perfectly honest with
you the cable will carry pictures from
your computer to screen it sends you
images video and more using bringing
binary code zeros and ones we will but
not till later okay plug the big end of
the orange cable into the brain
don't forget the cable managed as you go
what's key will manage cable managing is
taking these little cables and making
sure that they are
is that is that the battery that's right
that batteries power cable into the
brains you know it still needs to be
edited and you know how we edit videos
you know on a computer the idea is that
you're taking the entire internals of a
tablet and you're kind of connecting
them in a bright colorful
easy-to-understand way very cool
I heard someone running who was that
thank you
it's not a bad it's not a bad bet if you
see someone with their shirt off it's
probably dentist do you think you're
pretty smart now are you smarter than
you were a year ago and we did this even
though this one's more complicated you
can do it that's upside down my dear how
smart you think that well that may be
true but you should probably aspire to
greater to the top and it's a little bit
easier if you do this in the bottom so
maybe you still need your old man after
all huh batteries yeah now we need the
battery can you bring the battery over
darlin the keyboard on the battery I see
that no cuz it's not plugged into the
battery anymore that's how it charges
just that big ah yeah that looks good to
me
go for it good job
it covers all the pins yep you got it
make sure you got it the right way you
got to look at it because it's keyed so
it only goes one way look at the shape
so you got to check the slot that you're
plugging it in to make sure that you're
putting it in the right way are you
putting it in the right way sweetie
you're putting it didn't know you're
still putting it in backwards no is the
other way though no it's a power brick
alright we are so close look it's almost
done does ours look like that one yeah
good so right here is the brain that
does all the thinking for the computer
and then right here is the power button
and also this is where the power comes
in for the brain so you plug into the
wall right here and then it goes into
our battery which charges up with
battery juice and then that powers over
here our brain and it powers our display
controller that's a screen so that's
gonna turn on soon
are you sure yeah are you sure have you
got it quite a lot info I think your
sisters trying to show you something
you guys got to figure it out I'm not
I'm not doing it today uh-huh
that's our power cord are you sure are
you sure no this this isn't done yet
hold on there we go there okay
you guys gotta figure it out I'm not I'm
not doing it today so remember the HDMI
cable we plugged in okay but can you can
you look at it this way oh yeah now do
you remember I thought you were talking
about last year's we are gonna actually
be using a separate computer to
intercept the signal that's running down
this cable and record it for the
audience out there on YouTube pretty
cool huh
yeah we're entering the matrix this is a
way better kit honestly having the
screen all like integrated into it so
that is just one piece like this
whoa what was that hello can you make
some noise
quick make some noise everyone quiet
look how big that noise was you can tell
how big the noise is by how big it is
see how that is really loud or are you
ready for the touchscreen part yeah so
these wires running through here and you
touch right there what you do is you
send a signal to this wire and this wire
and it knows your fingers right there
cool huh
and that's right it can detect more than
one finger at a time
there you go good job
so this says set background color - and
then you snap that onto the bottom under
the powder dark clouds whoa
so we're gonna let you use it and we're
gonna let you pick what colors okay deal
if you want girl hair oh boy hair oh I
think so - what color belt should we put
a hat how does that oh my goodness it's
antlers okay here we are this is so much
better of just like an overall package
yeah up and down
you gotta pay attention you're getting
your bike kicked arrows up and down you
got it there you go
go up up up oh no there you go now
you're gonna have it so much easier when
they can also use the touchscreen to
just go through the menus and stuff so
it says start with start ups and it
points over there 15 drop down and pick
the forest background you should
probably use the mouse for this touch is
great for certain things but for others
it's better to use a mouse yeah there
you go
you didn't want a forest background
alright we went with Minecraft okay so
do you guys want to do story mode now so
story mode has lots of challenges and it
has a lot of things that you can learn
about your computer that's in here how
about making the most awesome game of
pong and relax your eye on the orange
Hut and try to be challenged do you
think you can beat two challenges yeah
oh wow there's lots of new quests since
last time you logged in Hong Kong I love
I love pong fancy a game even better
make you play pong why don't I make
thong first what kind of scene would you
like do you want space or minecraft no
space yeah okay now let's go over to our
startups again oh wow okay make it big -
how big
oh wow that's gonna be pretty big oh
okay now play go ahead and make that
super slow yeah that's pretty slow I
think this game of pong would go on
quite literally forever okay no you're
done okay can I go speed 100 please okay
and we can also add some events so if
player one gets a goal what do we want
it to do maybe it could make a sound Oh
what sound you want it to make cap okay
let's go make I think we made the
world's easiest pong game it just makes
this sound we keep scoring should we add
some more features oh that's so good so
let's make logic if do so if let's say
hit then events our actions player 1
wins no that's too easy
maybe we could have that make another
sound how about blue P all right well
I've got to get back to work so do you
guys want to maybe keep doing story mode
you can explore the inside of the
computer well why don't you just story
mode for a little bit because I think
that's what your sister would like to
see okay okay so there you have it guys
that's the cattle KITT touch it includes
a handful more things than the regular
cow no computer but honestly the
usability and the portability of it is
really nice like you can actually
reconfigure the screen to flip around so
you can use it in front of you while
you're lying down or you can put it up
like this pretty freakin sick and you
can store the keyboard back here
assuming that you don't have a bunch of
wires running out of it for capture if
you guys want to check out this one or
we're also gonna have the Harry Potter
wand
