lot of requests to have a look at the ax
series so this is the 850 watt version
from the ax series I'm actually gonna
check out the 750 as well as the 1200 so
you can talk a little bit about what the
differences are between these three
models but I haven't seen those ones yet
so I won't be able to talk about any
differences today so this is a high
performance ATX power supply why thank
you Corsair thank you for telling me
that that is so incredibly helpful
what's high-performance about it is this
is the one one of the most efficient
power supplies on the market this is 80
plus gold okay so that means that it
achieves basically 80 plus gold is
almost like 90 plus because at about a
50% load which realistically if you're
running like a pretty high-end gaming
machine a couple GTX 460 is a quad core
that's about what you're gonna see
you're gonna run even at 120 volt AC
you're gonna run at almost 90 percent
efficiency okay so okay I exaggerated a
little bit it's not ninety plus but the
way 80 plus is measured is that it has
to achieve at least I believe this one
is 88 to 89 percent for 80 plus gold at
very low load very high load as well as
at medium load so that's pretty cool
alright so here on the back they also
talked a little bit about what
connectors it has they talked about the
true modular cabling system so all
capable cables are detachable from the
power supply now whereas Corsairs power
supplies used to have hardwired 24 pin
as well as I believe EPS pin EPS pin EPS
connectors incredible efficiency so yeah
with ninety percent efficiency and
they're talking about 220 volt for the
most part there which most people in
North America are not running so the
Corsair advantage with more than
years experience okay and then the last
thing we should probably also say before
we even open the box is it comes with a
seven-year warranty so Corsairs warranty
service is legendary and with a
seven-year with seven years of coverage
from their warranty service you can
print anything goes wrong they will
replace it for you they will get you
taken care of and you will be a happy
Corsair customer I've actually
personally are made something from
Corsair I don't remember what it was but
I remember just they got back to me
really fast and yeah I think the best
RMA experiences are the ones that you
don't really remember because that means
that something went right and nothing
went wrong okay so industry-leading
protection
oh yeah they've got an EU P logo on here
as well so that's that new that new
green thing I don't remember exactly
what the requirements are but it's on
there so it uses a different kind of box
from first Harris previous power supply
so you can see we've got a sleeve here
and then we have their more traditional
box shape underneath which is sealed
again look at that so I get to unbox
more things in this particular episode
look at that break more seals I do like
breaking seals and not clubbing seals
not all canadians are into that
okay so here's our manual it is an
English francais Deutsch and that pretty
much covers all the ones that I sort of
remotely even know how to say maybe a
cameraman can contribute this one for us
ah there we go
alright next we have the power cord and
of course there's using a nice quality
flexible power cord with let's see maybe
we can even say what the no nevermind
anyway it's thick there enjoy that
knowledge alright next we have some
cable ties as well as a course our case
badge we also find four black screws so
if you want to make sure that the back
of your case has black screws holding in
the power supply instead of mismatched
silver screws then use that and that
will be good okay let's have a look at
the power supply itself and then we'll
look at the modular cables so comes at a
nice little baggie here which you could
use to store your gym strip if you're in
high school and you still need a little
bag for your gym strip so you could
carry it to school and your course air
bag and then you'd be the talk of the
town because realistically once you
unplug this power supply once you open
up this power supply you're pretty much
gonna use it forever because it's pretty
darn good ok
well it's actually surprisingly small
for an 850 watt unit so they have a
120mm fan and you can see that even with
only a 120mm fan it's not a particularly
long power supply I was actually
expecting for an 80 plus power supply
that it would be a little bit longer
because with the well built quality
units unless they're using even more
well-built even higher quality
components you tend to see them a little
bit bigger to make room for all of the
extra
extra junk inside so here if we look
inside you can see the heat sinks are
actually quite small and that's a
product of this being a very very
efficient power supply you don't have a
whole lot of excess heat to get rid of
when you're running with it running with
it
I meant running it I didn't mean running
with it all right let's have a look at
the modular cables that we have included
here so actually no let's finish looking
the power supply chain movement okay so
here we've got our 120mm fan as I
mentioned before we've got our kind of
pretty much industry standard honeycomb
grille on the back with an on/off switch
and a power plug then on the top oh yeah
this is a single rail power supply check
that out 70 amps on the single 12 volt
rail up to 840 watts don't do that it
doesn't focus up to 840 Watts on that
single 12 volt rail and then I think
that's pretty much the highlight of that
label you can see there's a bit of a
gold color scheme to the power supply
which goes along with its 80 plus gold
rating and then here is the modular
interface so let's look at what we would
potentially plug into this okay so this
this plug says 750 850 ax only so only
plug it into this so it goes Wow 10 and
10 plugs that's kind of interesting I
wonder why they've gone and done that so
it goes where I don't know where it goes
it goes here okay so it looks like we
have two plugs for either 4 + 4 or 8
sorry about that my memory card filled
up is which happens a fair bit okay so
you can plug in up to - 4 + 4 or 8 pin
EPS connectors so you can see that's
what these two right here are for and
then wow there's so many cables in here
I mean look at this this is like
ridiculous
ok so I'll go through and I'll find
everything that is relevant so here we
have this is 2 6 + 2 pin PCIe so these
ones plug in here presumably somewhere
here No
here no
okay yeah okay so you can plug in to six
plus to pin PCIe or you can plug in EPS
connectors here okay and then you can
also plug in six plus two pin connectors
no wow this is one of the more
complicated modular interfaces I've seen
to be to be perfectly honest because I
don't actually see how to plug in oh I
guess you I guess you can't I guess you
can can't plug in oh wait here we go oh
I get it
okay here so here we are this is a four
plus four or eight pin connector and
this one goes here so then you can
either plug in two 6 plus 2 times 2 so
up to 4 6 plus 2 pin PCIe connectors or
you can plug in 2 6 plus 2 PCIe
connectors and an additional 4 plus 4 so
if you have a board like a rampage 3
extreme that takes 2 8 pin CPU
connectors then you can plug those in
but then you can only run one
high-powered graphics card or you can
plug in only one and you can run two
high-powered graphics cards yes we
figured it out excellent so then here's
some molex ones each of these has four
molexes on it and that's pretty much the
whole top row of connectors here so this
is for molex and SATA one two three four
or five of those all right so let's go
through here and see how many of those
we have so this is for SATA this one is
for SATA this one is oh yeah 4-pin molex
to floppy adapter because really most
people don't use those anymore
here's two SATA and here is another
molex to floppy just in case you're
running crossfire Radeon 9700 pros and
then we've got a another Google SATA so
you could potentially run 4 plus 4 is 8
so 12 SATA connections off here and then
like four more lexis and then last but
not least
we have the 24 pin connector which is
broken up into two pieces so you
actually plug that in with one here at
the bottom so that's what that last last
rank on the bottom was for and then one
here at the top and that is your 20 4
pin connector thank you for checking out
