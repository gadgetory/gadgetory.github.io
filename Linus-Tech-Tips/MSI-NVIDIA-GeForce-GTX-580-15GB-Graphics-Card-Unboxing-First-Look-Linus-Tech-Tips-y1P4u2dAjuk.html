GeForce GTX 580 this is an NVIDIA GPU
features all of the latest technologies
including GeForce CUDA and Vidia sli
physics 3d vision including 3d visions
two-round with up to three monitors
we've also got some other cool points
here check this out so this is a special
sticker that goes on USA Canada and
Mexican models so they've got a
three-year warranty in all of those
countries and this particular MSI card
features all solid capacitors for
improved lifespan so we can actually
find some more details about that on the
back so ten years ultra long lifetime
with no explosion I think what they
actually mean to say is no leaking
because typically capacitors although
they can't explode
typically they're just gonna leak so
you've also got lower temperatures
higher efficiency but bear in mind your
card will not explode very good so we've
got a little list of the features here
so that is DirectX 11 SLI that is up to
three way and even four-way SLI surround
physics CUDA Direct compute Nvidia
purevideo HD technology is a PCI Express
2.0 card you can read this I'm sure oh
hey cool we got HDMI 1.4 a so that means
that you are able to play with
appropriate software 3d blu-ray óó
appropriate software and appropriate TV
that's gonna cost you minimum system
requirements are as follows here so
Nvidia recommends a minimum 600 water
greater power supply with a minimum of
42 amps on the 12 volt rail and up here
this is one of the coolest things about
MSI video cards is that they all come
compatible with MSI Afterburner which is
if you follow my blog and outstanding
little overclocking utility that I
personally use very frequently and I
really really like and MSI has just done
a great job in their partnership with
rivet tuner basically well they've
reskin the program and they've added a
couple features they've made it really
simple to use and they've also added
their little combustor utility which is
in partnership with the firm art guys so
they've given you the all the means to
overclock and test your
ethics card out-of-the-box which is
pretty cool so accessory-wise we've got
a six pin to eight pin power connector
we've also got a dual 4-pin molex to
single six pin power connector and then
we have that's a nice long cable to look
at that so we've got what looks to be
about a six foot mini HDMI to HDMI cable
for me to see what else we've got
pleated here and then I'll stop teasing
you guys and look at the card itself
next we've got a DVI to VGA adapter
finally we have a utilities and Driver
DVD or CD I don't know what it is but
either way throw it away download the
latest from the msi website we've got a
quick users guide which is big there we
are so they show some other msi products
how to plug it into your computer all
that good stuff throw that back together
and then finally we've got the 580 GTX
series so this shows you how to use
their live update for the drivers and
also access stuff well you want to get a
quick start guide so there you have it
two Quick Start guides true for the
price of one you know someone should run
that Pirlo on GTX 580 s I bet they'd
sell a lot of GTX 580 s if they did two
for the price of one so one of em s eyes
kind of unique little things as they
include these little blue covers on all
of your connectors which means that
people like me can safely handle the
card without touching the contacts
actually everyone gives me a hard time
about this but I'm finally going to
explain why I don't care about touching
the contacts like this okay here let me
show you guys so you see where my finger
touches the side of the PCB I actually
am NOT making contact with the little
golden contacts along the edge of the
PCI Express 16x connector look at that
see no matter how hard I press on there
I'm not going to touch them so I'm only
touching a completely inert part of the
PCB when I handle a video card like this
so there you go now you know let's have
a look at the back of this video card so
you can see here where the GPU is
situated so that's going to be where
most of the bulky cooling power is done
now bear in mind the GTX 580 and the
reference
design does use a vapor chamber design
so it's not using standard heat pipes
next we have some vrm cooling our VRM
VRMs here so that is delivering the
power from these six pin and eight pin
power connectors over to all the
power-hungry parts that need them
speaking of power-hungry the GTX 580
improves over the 480 in a lot of ways
one of which is performance another of
which is heat that is to say it gives
off less heat than the 580 and last but
not least is power consumption so the
580 performs better runs cooler and
doesn't consume as much power as the GTX
480 so I think we've looked at the back
of the card fairly in-depth here so oh
you can actually see there's a little
vent here so when this fan spins it's
gonna exhaust just a little bit of air
out the back cool off those solid caps
and make sure that they're all staying
nice and not toasty
so that is performing very well so MSI
has put on their customized branding on
the card here so we've got an MSI logo
to go along with the GeForce one on the
top and then we've got a little looks
like some kind of like a jet or
something what is this here there's a
bigger one here if you guys can tell me
what that is I would very much
appreciate it maybe it's like a
spaceship I'm not actually sure anyway
so it's stuck on afterburner branding on
it as well as MSI branding on it and
they've called out the name at the end
580 GTX right there you've got a
standard fan that is to say a rear
exhaust fan which NVIDIA has been using
on their reference high-end cards for
quite some time because it does allow
you to remove the heat from the card and
exhaust it out the back of your case
rather than exhausted into your case
where it's just going to mean that all
of the other components are going to run
hotter which isn't to say that it's the
only approach that works but it's worked
quite well for end video over the last
little while so they've continued to use
it on the back we've got two DVI ports
as well as a mini HDMI and MSI has
generally as generously included the
mini HDMI to HDMI cable because not many
people have televisions that run off
mini HDMI so thank you for checking out
my unboxing of the MSI GTX 580 this is a
1.5 and gigabyte
graphics card that's the amount of
memory and it also has the fastest
graphics processor in the world right
