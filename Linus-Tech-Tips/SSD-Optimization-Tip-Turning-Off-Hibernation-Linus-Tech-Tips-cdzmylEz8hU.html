optimization tips for SSDs so here's one
that is very very useful if you have an
SSD you probably know that they're not
very big the average size of an SSD
these days is around 120 gigs so I ran
into a situation where I was using space
sniffer to figure out the differences
between the OSS I had installed on a
couple of my SSDs and I realized that my
hibernation file hybrid file dot says
you're not to get too close because I'll
read it out is 12 gigs of space on a 120
gig Drive I never ever hibernate my test
bench PC that's something I only really
use on a notebook so why am I wasting
this space that I could be using to
install more copies of battlefield 3
that doesn't run off my external Steam
Drive and insists on installing in
program files because origin is awesome
so yeah that's what I could be doing
with that space instead so I'm going to
show you guys how to disable it
completely because it's not as simple as
just setting it to hibernate after
settings never you also have to turn off
allow hybrid sleep and then once you're
done that so you access this through
control panel all control panel items
power options edit plan settings so you
have to go to the change advanced power
settings the next thing you have to do
is open up an elevated command prompt so
the way to do that is you search for CMD
in the Start menu you right-click and
you run as administrator then and your
elevated command prompt you type power
CFG dash H so that's for hibernate space
off press that and delete the out that
deleted it okay the instructions that I
had seen have sometimes mentioned
deleting that file but it looks like you
actually don't have to now all of a
sudden I have 12 gigs more space on my
boot drive yay now I can install more
stuff on my computer that I do not
hibernate so there that is my tech tip
for the day unless I upload two videos
today in case in which case that's one
