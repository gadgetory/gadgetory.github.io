here covered the ins and outs of the
specs of the geforce gtx 960 and how it
stacks up in the landscape of other
single GPU graphics card configurations
for gamers today's video is two things
it's a look at the overclocking results
in performance of gigabytes g1 gaming
edition 960 a higher price but perhaps
higher performance alternative to Asus
Strix 960 and second it's an
investigation of the sensibility of
running 960s in SLI versus buying a
single 970 on the subject of sensibility
do quick charging phone wall adapters
make sense
that's an upcoming video but for now
this one cooler masters case mod world
series is your opportunity to show off
your modding skills and win great prizes
entries closed february 7 to 2015
click now to learn more so we'll start
with a brief rundown of the gtx 960 with
a particular emphasis on gigabytes
implementation g1 gaming is their top
tier of card and aside from being over
built with a 6 phase power design and
dual 6 pin PCI e connectors it features
a chip that's gone through what gigabyte
calls the GPU gauntlet sorting to
guarantee higher overclocking
capabilities and given that we got ours
running stable at fifteen sixty five
megahertz throughout our test suite we
either got lucky or what they're doing
is working the cooler plays a role here
as well though with the wind force 3 X's
quad 6 millimeter heat pipe triple fan
design doing a great job of staying
quiet and keeping our chip cool under
load at a maximum of 67 degrees Celsius
even with the card overclocked to the
max the way that we do for our GPU
testing and it managed to stay
completely silent at idle and under
light loads with a neato LED indicator
next to the illuminated windforce logo
that tells you if the fans are off and
the card is running in silent mode
something that more and more cards are
able to do these days but hey it's a
feature that's on here thought I better
mention it I'm not sure why though that
we need the LED indicator because I
could just look at the fans if I wanted
to know if they are stopped but whatever
gigabyte onto the rest of the car
it's got a PCIe gen3 16x slot on the
bottom a single SLI connector on the top
for supportive up to 2-way SLI
it's got the same technologies as other
gtx 960 so that's h.265 encoding and
decoding dynamic super resolution mfa
anti-aliasing which we used for our
testing thanks to its similar appearance
and smaller performance hit compared to
msaa
and great power efficiency with this
card drawing only 250 watts total from
the wall for the entire system when
overclocked under loading Crysis 3 but
it also has one other special text
something that gigabyte calls flex
display technology which is basically an
onboard active DisplayPort to DVI
adapter that affords users a little bit
more flexibility especially those using
an older DVI based display just pay
attention to the coating on the back of
the i/o shield for which ones you can
plug in at the same time now aside from
the stuff that I covered so far and
different stock and boost clock speeds
at their hearts all gtx 960 s are
essentially the same with two gigs of
DDR 5 memory on a 128-bit bus a fully
enabled Maxwell architecture GM 206
processing core with all the CUDA cores
and SM X's that go along with that and a
price in the 200 to 230 dollar range so
you might be questioning the point of
doing a review of one 960 yesterday and
another one today which is why we spent
a little bit of extra time and not only
through our win force 960 at its max
overclock the full OC spreadsheet by the
way is linked in the video description
below on to our standard 59 60 X test
bench but we also rented an SLI with our
Strix card to see how to two hundred ish
dollar cards stack up to a single one of
their three hundred and fifty dollar ish
Big Brother the GTX 970 so our single
card testing didn't reveal any great you
know revelations it turns out that when
you clock one gtx 960 slightly faster
than another one it performs ever so
slightly better whether this and all the
pros and cons of one card versus another
is worth another $15 or not to you is
entirely your deal
but our sli 960 versus 970 at 4k results
were ever so slightly more interesting
in spite of the 960s much lower memory
bandwidth and half sized frame buffer
remember to two gig cards is two gig
effective vram in sli it scaled well in
sli considering the price of the
solution compared to a single 970 except
in WoW where it didn't at all so I think
that pretty much wraps it up for the
gigabyte g1 gaming GTX 960 and also our
gtx 960 coverage in general we used to
do a lot more videos about the different
variants of a particular graphics core
but unless something really exciting and
unexpected happens this will likely be
our last word on this one if you're
looking for a quiet and efficient single
GPU solution it's a great choice if heat
power consumption and noise are not
issues for you the r9 290 for as little
as forty dollars more compared to a card
like this stomp sit and if you're
looking to pair up two graphics cards
then I would personally go with a single
GTX 970 over to 960 s4 the 4 gig frame
buffer and the more consistent
performance across a variety of games
that comes with using a single GPU
speaking of affordable and consistent
today sponsored ting calm ting uses the
Sprint network so anywhere with good
Sprint service will have good ting
service but it's their billing strategy
that sets them apart from other wireless
carriers instead of locking you into
some arbitrary well two hundred and
fifty of minutes of this and five
hundred megabytes of that ting lets you
use and pay for exactly what you need
and what's cool is that if you're not
sure whether this strategy will actually
work out better for you visit Linus
ENCOM to enter your last few bills and
it'll spit out how much you would have
paid by switching to ting so head over
there today and give it a whirl if you
like what you see you can even get a
partial credit towards making the switch
Boop anyway guys thanks for watching
like this video if you liked it dislike
it if you thought it sucked leave a
comment if you're feeling it's more
complicated in this as always linked in
the video description we have a place to
buy t-shirts like this one give us a
monthly contribution or change your
amazon bookmark come on start billion
code so we get a small kickback whenever
you buy graphics cards or whatever else
it is you buy on Amazon that kind of
thing helps us out a lot thanks again
for watching and as always don't forget
