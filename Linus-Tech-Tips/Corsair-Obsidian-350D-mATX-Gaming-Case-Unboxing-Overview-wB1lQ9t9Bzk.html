Corsair obsidian 350d micro ATX case
exceptional expansion and cooling
flexibility for compact high performance
PCs visit Corsair comm / obsidian to
learn more welcome to my unboxing and
first look at the Corsair 350d now
courser initially launched their case
line with an obsidian case that was an
ATX case a very large one I might add
the 800 D and then they followed it up
they fleshed out the lineup with
additional cases in lower end series
such as carbide or graphite and obsidian
has been reserved for their extremely
high end cases now this is their first
micro ATX case and it is not losing the
performance heritage of their any of
their sort of launch cases which I guess
the only one that I can really compare
it to is actually the 800 d but let's
not worry too much about that the point
is this is meant to change the way that
people build small high performance
systems I mean with boards like a
Seuss's gene series which have been
available for a couple generations now
there's really no reason why you can't
put exactly as much cooling in exactly
as much performance on a micro ATX
system as you can on an ATX system so
once I actually figure out how to get
the Box open here so you can see my
thumb is ah
jammed in there trying to get it ah
there we go so we'll be back in just a
moment now the case itself comes in a
hard foam but more on that in a moment
let's see what Corsair has to say for
themselves on the Box they've got a QR
code here photos videos product tour and
more but don't worry about that you're
watching a video about the product right
now blown-up version of the case they've
also got some good general details about
the overall specs flexible cooling
options comes with 140 millimeter intake
fan 120 millimeter exhaust fan there are
five mounts total the front and top
mounts are spaced for 240 millimeter
radiators for more cooling options
that's what Corsairs done well as
they've really integrated liquid cooling
options well with their cases not only
accommodating for their own products
which are usually sort of prefilled
all-in-one units but also for custom
look
cooing I mean this is something that a
lot of manufacturers do that drives me
absolutely crazy is they operate under
this assumption that the consumer is
going to buy only their own products and
like you know okay but what about
consumers who aren't interested in all
in one liquid coolers you know so you
look at a lot of different cases and
they are completely unoptimized for a
custom cooling loop um and they call
themselves water cooling ready because
they put radiator ready spacing in the
top so that you could mount an
all-in-one so anyway that's just my
little rent there of course air doesn't
do this particularly looking at their
most recent cases like the 350d as well
as the 900 d so not the greatest phone
that i've ever seen not particularly
dense not particularly strong it is a
smaller case and this is a factor you
don't need to protect it as much in
shipping when it's smaller and doesn't
weigh as much so I'm sure Corsair take
the necessary drop tests like there are
standards for this crush testing and all
that kind of stuff before bringing the
350 D to market because they've been
generally pretty good about packaging
overall having worked at an online
retailer I in Canada where shipping can
often result in things dying very
horrible deaths didn't happen too much
with Corsair stuff so let's start with
the outside of the case we've got a nice
big window on the side I like this I
don't necessarily always prefer a window
that lets you see everything like the
power supply and drives and all that
kind of stuff but what I like about this
particular one is it gives it a very
clean look because the sizes of the
window isn't overly huge but it's sort
of even on all sides and just makes it
look very very clean without sort of
being over-the-top flashy game
arelooking on the front you can see this
front plate did seem to mean that kingly
spirit that's a shame
okay so let's go ahead and speaking of
shipping in Canada being a bit of a
nightmare let's have a look at the front
plate here so it's a beautiful brushed
aluminum finish
metal front plate hopefully you guys can
see that very small innocuous Corsair
logo on the bottom they've got two
little dots here so that you'll know
where to press if you want to remove
this and it looks like oh it looks like
that comes off that's lucky there we go
alright so no actual damage done to the
case which is wonderful we've got a
removable fan filter here in the front
so in the front you can either mount a
single 140 millimeter fan or you can do
dual 120 millimeter fans you can
actually see there are alternate
mounting points here here here and here
okay I get it now so I'm gonna put this
on
I hate touching these because it's going
to stain ah so I'm going to put this
back on so you can see the ventilation
comes in around the sides here sides and
bottom so there's lots of space there
and then what Corsairs done just going
to do that is they've put in a dead
space here okay okay there we go
they've put in a dead space here that's
blocked off by these to allow the fans
to not be just trying to draw air
directly from a plastic plate that's
right in front of them so instead they
are bringing air in around from the
sides where there's that dead space and
then they can pull in from there so okay
we'll go ahead and remove the front fan
filter check this up so it can
accommodate a single 140 millimeter fan
in the middle which is what Corsair
ships it with in the area where there's
the least restriction so if you look
through that then it goes right directly
into the chassis however you have the
option we have the included mounting
holes here here here here here here and
here anyway all over the place to mount
dual one 20s or even dual 140 millimeter
fans in the front of the case then the
other fans won't necessarily have quite
the same effectiveness of this one fan
but obviously doubling up the fans even
if efficiency is reduced a little bit is
still going to give you more overall
cooling performance so that's a very
cool approach to take there on the top
of the case alright so two five and a
quarter inch bays headphone microphone
and reset switches here
power switch up here two USB 3.0 super
speeds and then yeah two five no
quarter-inch base so there that takes
care of the front on the top you've got
that same flexibility so dual 120 mil or
dual 140 millimeter and check this up in
order to account for the
fact that sometimes the spacing isn't
exact on certain liquid coolers or
whatever else they've expanded the holes
for one of the 140 millimeter mounts so
you can change the spacing a little bit
if you want that's that's actually a
really nice touch as well it goes to
show you coarser actually builds system
in their systems in their cases before
they release them to market which I
can't say for everyone on this side
there's not a whole lot
okay blank side panel here we've got a
removable fan filter that's actually one
of the most ruggedly designed removable
fan filters I've ever seen look at this
thing it's like solid usually they're
extremely flimsy so let's go ahead and
and the rails that it sits in are really
nice as well
locks into place so you can see there's
a little bit of resistance to remove
that and then it has like these huge
plastic rails sits on that's kind of
nice ah the feet are covered in little
rubber feet so that it doesn't slide
around all over the place and that's
cool so check this out all the pieces in
the bottom okay so there's rivets here
here here here and here but it looks
like the drive cages are going to be
mounted by screws so we should be able
to remove those no problem at the back
of the case we find pretty standard oh
look at this five PCI expansion slots so
they've allowed you to install a dual
slot card in the bottom of your n ATX
board so that will effectively give you
what you would normally have on a board
with five expansion slots so you can
fill this one fill this one and then you
can actually install an additional card
in between even if you have something
like an SLI setup which is very cool
I've always felt that's a limitation of
the micro ATX platform is that you can't
have two dual slot graphics cards
running an SLI or crossfire and have a
high end audio card or something like
that so that's really cool to see as
well 120-millimeter cooling fan in the
back liquid cooling holes which Corsair
wisely left in because most people won't
be using those as well as standard power
supply mounting alright let's open this
bad boy up and find out what makes her
tick
thumb screws on the back make it easy to
remove the back panel overall um I'd say
it's not quite at the same level as I
would have expected from an obsidian
clasp case looking at case
like the 800 D and the 650d in terms of
the construction so there's a little bit
of flex here as you guys can send me we
expect this on a windowed side panel but
quite honestly when I wrapped on the
other side panel it wasn't really all
that Oh inspiring either Oh actually
okay that's not as bad as I thought okay
well there you go either way I mean it's
not built like an 800 D but it's also
not priced like an 800 d so there's sort
of something to consider all right so
once we get inside we've got two or
three and a half inch sliding hard drive
cages now these are usually flimsy but
once you actually put a drive in them
they stiffen right up until you can
slide those back in there this whole
cage comes out I love the use of screws
for the construction instead of using
rivets so there's those screws on the
bottom as well as right here screws on
the back this gives you the flexibility
so you wanted to looks like just two
screws on this side here this gives you
the flexibility to remove the whole
thing including these two and a half
inch mounts that's how you're going to
be able to mount those radiators in the
front of the case itself which leaves
you just with five and a quarter inch
base up here in the bottom they've of
course thought support for nice long
power supplies I mean Corsair builds an
awful lot of power supplies so they're
going to want you to be able to use
anything from their range and something
that they're going to brand as a
performance class case and they've done
another wise thing here which is to
improve it include enough cable routing
holes in the bottom this is huge so many
case guys have like one hole at the
bottom and then like six holes around
the motherboard tray it's like okay well
how where are all these cables going to
come from if I wasn't able to put them
through here so there's two big ones
down here there's one up here for your 8
pin or your 4 pin one up here for
whatever you might need to run to the
very top right hand edge of your board
maybe they want you to use it for
routing the front i/o or something like
that by the motherboard tray and then
once here for your 24 pin or whatever
else assuming you're not just routing
them around the edge of the motherboard
tray here motherboard tray itself feels
quite solid considering that there's an
extremely large cutout for the CPU so no
matter where your CPU socket is
positioned you shouldn't have too much
difficulty with that and I just want to
have a look at
check that out so that's how this comes
out there you go there's your two and a
half inch drive now so these are awesome
hey slick can you throw me an SSD
preferably Corsair CI now I'm putting
that now I'm putting the pressure on him
there we go
haha of course our Neutron GTX so this
is how the installation process works
here
you just pop this bad boy in and it
loads just like that look at that it's
spring-loaded too so when you open it up
it pops it out for you you don't have to
do any of the work this is actually
better than the one that I saw
implemented on I believe it was these
300 are that one was a little bit stiff
and a little bit hard to get the drives
out of looks like Corsair
figured that out and got that fixed with
this guy right here so there you go now
there's tons of space there so what's
the point of all this I guess would be
the next question oh yeah there's some
internal cables and stuff that you might
want to see of course there of course
always with the nice little touches I
mean it's all about spending money in
the right places spend money making that
OAM use black cables they don't like it
because you know it's harder to QC
but make them do it and then maybe the
side panels a little bit thinner or
whatever else don't worry too much about
that because this is the way the people
end up with systems that actually look
good and look high-performance and look
high-class that's why Corsair cases have
so many build logs done in them where it
just looks really good because they
spend the time and spend the money on
those little finishing touches same
thing even youth I'd like to see someone
implement a less bulky USB 3 connector
but I guess you know you can't have
everything that you want necessarily but
either way it's all black even the
connector here at the end I've seen a
lot of them that are black except this
little bits blue you can still see it
you can still see it coming out included
little bits here so you got fan screws
that's good you got some other more
different screws you got some zip ties
and all that kind of stuff I like this
personally when they include one
stationary standoff that doesn't get
something screwed into it because it
gives you a reference point for where to
position the board as you're putting it
into the case not everyone does this and
even many brands that do it don't do it
consistently so there you go torque
there if you're watching this keep doing
this I like this I appreciate this
there's a tool list five and a quarter
Bay but as usual you don't have to use
it to lessly you can screw screws in and
that will actually be more secure for
things like shipping it around and I
think we're pretty much done here so why
do we need this if you want to build a
high-performance system you know SLI
crossfire whatever else and you don't
want to expend any more space than you
absolutely need to if you want something
that could be portable say for example
if you're a video production house and
you want to be able to move around a
rendering workstation with you that's
not that heavy then something like this
would be a fantastic choice and the fact
that its windowed and liquid cooling
ready and all that good stuff is just
kind of icing on the cake at this point
