optimized for silent operation click now
to learn more now I often get asked by
people how much storage should I get for
my computer whether it's an SSD or
whether it's a hard drive and the answer
invariably is I don't know how am I
supposed to know how much storage you
need I can't
however what I can tell you is that for
me personally 120 or 128 gigs which is
the SSD size that you'll find in a lot
of more entry-level machines these days
is really not enough for me I find that
256 or 240 gig class drives are the
sweet spot in terms of a price to
capacity ratio and if you can go higher
and you can still fit that in your
budget then great now Intel sent over
this XPS 12 Ultrabook which I kind of
fired up and I was like oh that's got
Core i5 ok cool it's got you know nice
IPS 1920 by 8 Kennedy or whatever it is
that 1080p thing screen oh it's got a
120 gig SSD so the first thing I did was
I was like oh crap can I take it apart
and the answer is yes it doesn't take a
two and a half inch SSD it takes an M
SATA SSD so this is I think the first
time we've really talked about M SATA on
Linus tech tips what it is is it's a
smaller SATA standard so it's still just
as fast as a regular state of drive in
most cases it still uses the SATA
interface so it's not like PCI Express
based one or anything like that but what
it is is it's super small so all the
flash chips are integrated on to a tiny
little PCB and the controller's on there
and these this little custom connector
here that doesn't have any housings
around it it's just a SATA interface
with no housings around it and moved
around a little bit so what we're gonna
do is we're gonna walk you through the
steps of upgrading the SSD in your
notebook it's really important to find
out from the manufacturer what type of
drive your model accepts whether it's a
nine millimeter two and a half inch
drive a seven millimeter two and a half
inch drive a five mil two and a half
inch drive or even an M SATA or even a
proprietary standard like for example
Apple's recent notebooks are often using
soldered SS
that are right on the motherboard so you
can't replace them at all and then work
from that knowledge so without further
ado here's my mSATA SSD upgrade on the
Dell XPS 12 releasing two shot one take
two
so the first step is really more of a
before you begin type thing so here's
that here's that drive that I was
talking about before because we're using
M SATA it's a little bit inconvenient
for data migration because we can't just
use one of these handy-dandy USB to SATA
interface cables to just clone the drive
before we even do the transfer so what
we'll have to do is we'll have to
actually backup everything that's on
here the good news is because it's a
factory load out there's not that much
data on there so you can actually back
up to an external hard drive or even a
large USB key if you happen to have one
then you can manually transfer
everything back over to the new M SATA
drive once you are done so you just got
to figure out a workflow for yourself if
you're not using M SATA though it is
quite a bit easier we're using Paragon
software for the backup and the restore
step two is to make sure you have a nice
safe anti-static workstation in our case
we're using a mod mat mainboard from mod
right and we're using the iFixit screw
driver kit with a Torx five bit on the
end of the screw driver to get this baby
open so step one is to locate all of the
screws and after removing them put them
in a safe place such as a small plastic
container like the one that happens to
be included with your drive haha look
how that worked out
once you've removed all the screws
carefully lift up the bottom cover never
force anything remember guys that there
are ports around the outside edges that
might stick through the chassis so you
don't want to put unnecessary strain on
those now that we've got our opened up
we can take a moment to just admire the
the workmanship that goes into a modern
Ultrabook so you can see like more than
half of the interior is taken up by the
massive battery which is actually it
looks like you could probably swap it
out if you really needed to which is
kind of cool I also like the del made it
relatively easy to remove this shell so
they did put crappy Torx screws in it
but they didn't make it
like you know clipped in or anything
like that so you can actually remove it
and put it back on without it looking
like garbage after you can see the
cooling fan for the CPU right here this
uses onboard graphics this is the main
motherboard right here where you've got
your RAM soldered on so it's four gigs
of RAM in this machine by default the
fourth gen one comes with eight gigs by
default and then there's actually a
little daughter board over here that has
some IO
so they were able to get this over here
right here is your Wireless which you
can see is plugged into the antennas
which go up here and then probably
around the outside of something you want
you want to you want those to be nice
and big and then here is our M SATA
drive that we're gonna be replacing so
all we got to do is peel up this little
cover right here alright and we see that
it is held in by one simple screw now
you can see once you remove the screw
that the M SATA Drive actually lifts
itself this is okay this is a function
of the slot here that it's supposed to
do that which makes it very very easy to
carefully remove so you can see whatever
is in here right now is an OEM part
number from Samsung so you can see the
Samsung flash modules on there as well
as I'm not too worried about the
warranty on this thing so let's just go
ahead and find out what kind of
controller it's using probably Samsung
Samsung is the world's number one SSD
manufacturer not just for their own
drives but also for other drives so
there's a Samsung DRAM chip right there
and then a samsung presumably yep
samsung controller right there so this
is a samsung SSD
so now that we have both SSDs you can
see that they actually use very similar
configurations because there's only so
much space on an MSA to PCB and you have
to put for flash chips so here we can
flip over the eight 801 there you go so
you're gonna have to fit four flash
chips your controller as well as your
cache so there's only so many options in
terms of layout so installation is
simple we've install it the same way
that we took it out so you actually go
in at an angle fold it down flat find
that Phillips head screw which is
different from all the others remember
anytime you're disassembling a notebook
unless screws are like markedly
different from each other and you're not
going very far into it you're going to
want to keep all the different types of
screws labeled and separate from each
other then we're going to lay this back
on top of it and that is it the physical
aspect of the upgrade is done so as long
as our data migration worked we're good
to go now that we're done we can admire
the sexy interior which unfortunately
isn't as sexy as the insides of Apple's
notebooks they do such a good job like
opening up a macbook you're just like oh
yeah they put some thought into that I
mean this ain't bad either but anyway
we're gonna go ahead put the cover back
on screw everything back into place with
our Torx screwdriver again and that's
that's that's kind of it so there you go
guys I hope this was informative I've
actually done notebook storage upgrades
before but I've never done one with an M
SATA Drive so there you go it's pretty
much the same procedure but slightly
more different don't forget to subscribe
