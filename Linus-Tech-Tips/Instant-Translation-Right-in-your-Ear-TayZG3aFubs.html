in my inbox from a weird overseas
company that isn't about yet another
battery bank and this one oh this one
caught my attention this is the WT - a
real-time translating earphone the pitch
and their included video suggests that
you just take one of these Twinkie bad
boys jam it into your ear canal find a
friend who doesn't speak the same
language as you and Jam the other one in
theirs and you can talk to each other
with real-time translation but could it
work
Roseville's orbit z1 mid tower case is
RGB ready it's got fans seven color LED
light strips and top iolite control
learn more at the link below so unboxing
wise this is pretty straightforward
there's not a lot included no manuals no
no like actual production hardware they
made it really clear to us this is early
software early hardware in fact they
sent us to one of which is actually
fully 3d printed so let's have a look at
what we got there's a micro USB charging
cable so that goes into the outside of
the magnetic box that holds here we go
so this passes the charging over to the
other side and then it comes with a
couple of these little silicon ear tip
pieces so hopefully they'll be slightly
less uncomfortable let's really don't go
on there that easily all right there we
go come on okay you have got to be
kidding me okay here's a design flaw for
you guys already you have to go through
that every time you charge it you have
to take this off to put oh why did I
take it off there's not really a whole
lot to the Twinkies so there's the
charging contacts on the inside there's
a microphone hole on this side there's a
little what looks like kind of like a
whatsapp logo that illuminates either
blue when it's pairing or green once
it's paired and then that also acts as a
capacitive button next order of business
we need the app which is only available
for iOS at this time there's no Android
version so once we've done just a normal
bluetooth pairing process hey all right
rock on so now we're connected it goes
like that
yeah there we go and it kind of sits in
your ear like like one of those douchey
Bluetooth headsets from the early 2000s
and there's two modes so ask mode hit
the microphone
okay I am now saying something oh I
think you hold it down I am saying
something now a baby holding down I'm
better now
well that was very close to my intent
okay I need someone who actually speaks
Chinese or this is not gonna go anywhere
I'll be right back okay so Dennis for
the sake of this video can you pretend
you don't speak any English perfect I
brought Dennis here for the chat mode so
that's a different mode chat mode is the
real-time translation that really got my
attention in their original email so
there's two modes one of us where's the
master and the other one where's the
slave which is a little awkward but you
don't understand what I'm saying anyway
right no English
[Laughter]
he's too good he's too good so let's try
let's try to have a conversation hello
you seem like a very nice person I would
like to be your friend
see ya that's the cantina and Campu
thank you but you look terrible okay
hold on what do you mean I look terrible
walk away down in one walk make violence
all go far well one thing is for certain
this does seem to be working fairly well
I'm glad I know what you truly think
about me sis yeah well I mean okay so
now I'm actually not very certain if
it's working properly okay okay let's
try one more scenario before we give up
okay I got another scenario so we've
already seen that it's pretty good for
like you know trying to pick someone up
so let's see if it works a little better
for that okay hey there sexy I would
like to spend some time with you tonight
remember first rule of improv is you can
never say no why he didn't toss em all
y'all , she did
well how did down oh I'm a little
nervous too baby
I've never done anything like this
before I say we get out of this place
and go find somewhere a little more
comfortable
I favor get out of this place and you'll
find I feel this more comfortable
oh no we're both gonna be comfortable
that's the idea look how comfortable you
feel right now watch on Yahoo you heard
done tonight ha wash your hands and do
so fool are you sure you wouldn't rather
have something a little stronger dad
something a little stronger
no it's cool baby my dad wants to be
involved too okay okay you know what not
just okay just did that make any sense
in Chinese I would rather just learn to
speak English or just use body language
well I guess with the picking up sort of
example the body language could be a you
know very yeah no okay well I wasn't
gonna have success with that either way
did anything that I was saying makes
sense in Chinese or were you just
cheating because you actually understand
me I would say only 10 to 20 percent of
the sentence out translate correctly and
every time you say take me home let's go
home together they translate quite well
so I got that right
at least so like what base is this you
know second base is you know grabbing
the breasts I mean when I come and stick
something in your ear hole you get to
touch my ear that's Dennis's first base
okay
the wt2 not quite ready for primetime
still some challenges even with the base
concept because I think carrying
something like this around being like
hey brother from another country can you
just wedge this thing in your ear and
then maybe we could talk to each other
doesn't seem since you have to have a
phone with you anyway like it's any more
efficient than just using Google
Translate or just use your hands Nihao
thanks yeah no English master op is
featuring a new product the grace
standard DAC it's made in collaboration
with grace design and the standard DAC
is all about setting a new standard in
entry-level daksa the product is
designed with the Objectivist audio file
in mind so it's meant to deliver good
performance that meets or exceeds the
measurements of the popular o DAC it's
equipped with the new AKM aka 44:52
digital to analog conversion chip
allowing it to process the most common
file types up to 24-bit 96 kilohertz
with no harshness or edge it runs off of
USB bus power with simple plug-and-play
operation that means no drivers are
needed for Windows Mac or Linux it's
compact and it's available on mass drop
through the link below for just 80 US
dollars alright so thanks for watching
guys Thank You Dennis for being a good
sport about trying out via the
translator here if you guys dislike this
video you can hit that button but if you
liked it hit the like button get
subscribed maybe consider checking out
well it's it's nowhere near primetime
ready as you guys can see
