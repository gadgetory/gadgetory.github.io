their new elite books so I've got the 14
inch 10 40 G 4 and the 12 and a half
inch x 360 1020 g2 here these are both
ultra slim business notebooks each of
them with three yes three discreet
hardware and forced security features to
keep your computer secure no matter
where you're working and this is
probably the coolest one toggleable
privacy filter what
most of the time you'll want the full
experience of the elite books glossy 4k
IPS touchscreen but what about
situations where you don't want
looky-loos spying over your shoulder or
you actually can't let others see the
sensitive information on your screen
like when you're trying to get some real
work done on a plane
sure view is HP's name for their
built-in privacy screen that you can
toggle with a one-button click this is
so cool
sure view combines a 3m light control
film on the screen with a proprietary
backlight behind it
so when sure view is off the backlight
uses two light sources to disperse light
across all areas of the display when
it's on however the backlight only uses
one light source and it focuses it
through the light control film in a
narrow 70 degree cone reducing up to 95%
of the light that's being emitted
outside of your privacy zone it doesn't
block off axis viewing to quite the same
degree as a standalone external filter
and it does cut down on the vertical
viewing angles a little bit even when
it's disabled but from our experience it
is more than good enough it doesn't add
any extra bulk to this super slim
notebook the ability to toggle it on and
off is freaking awesome and it can even
have the added benefit of increasing
battery life by up to 15% depending on
how long you keep it on alright let's
move on to attackers that aren't sitting
in the same room unsecured web browsing
is one of the most common attack vectors
for malware as innocent employees or
even woke IT buffs like you and I can
easily download malicious malware or
ransomware if we haven't had our morning
coffee yet to combat this HP has worked
closely with bromium on a feature that
they call sure click which is designed
to shift the cyber security
responsibility from the bright-eyed
Internet user to the PC itself whenever
you visit a website sure click isolates
the browsing session inside of a micro
virtual
machine which eliminates the ability of
that one site to infect the system or
even other browser tabs if a piece of
malware attacks a browsing session it
simply goes away once the infected tab
is closed
it all works through the shirt click
browser which currently supports both
Internet Explorer and chromium without
adding any extra Bologna but you can
also check out some vital stats through
the shirt click console including how
many pages have been safely opened and
how many micro VMs are instantiated at
that moment moving on let's look at the
last line of defense
our third security feature here it's a
below the OS protocol called HP
SureStart which I personally would have
called sure boot because it picks out
any foreign code that might have made
its way into your machines bios built
into a custom Hardware chip on the
system board SureStart will
cryptographically verify the integrity
of the HP BIOS code before the CPU is
allowed to execute even the first line
if the system detects that the BIOS has
been altered from a malicious attack for
an accidental error or whatever the
embedded controller will replace the
BIOS with a new copy that's stored in a
secret memory that can't be accessed by
third party software or malware
or even third-party firmware ok but hold
on a second - I don't really restart my
computer that often my BIOS could be
infected for days or weeks before
SureStart fixes it ah no so this latest
3rd generation of SureStart has run time
intrusion detection meaning it will
continually verify that a genuine HP
system BIOS is present in the system
flash and if tampering is detected it
will automatically restore the BIOS
while the system is running but even
with all these hardcore security
features there's no extra bulk on these
notebooks they're just over half an inch
at their thickest and are very light
despite all the goodies inside so ours
rock core i7 7600 you processors 16 gigs
of ram and a one terabyte nvme SSD with
HDMI output and dual Thunderbolt 3 ports
the X 360 even comes with a stylus if
you want to get your are
or more likely in my case jot down some
chicken scratch notes and diagrams not
too shabby
the 1040 G for in the x360 1020 G to
both start at $13.99 so be sure to check
