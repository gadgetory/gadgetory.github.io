ladies and gentlemen hey welcome to the
Wynn show right it's a show Riley and I
were just in the middle of discussing
what what you do on the wind show cuz he
hasn't been on it in a while and I was
on to actually guess we're jumping right
in two or three weeks ago Oh were you
but I screwed it up you screwed it up I
didn't click the and that was me
yes that's my fault ah yes was that now
he didn't know that I didn't know it was
you I knew I knew that a thing went
wrong Wow my co-workers protected so now
I'm gonna have to add land show to the
list of things that we can't trust Riley
with along with our TX 2080
reviews you know what you can trust me
with a new apparel pimping the merch hey
love it so I've actually got our like
oldest merch and then Riley's decked out
in our newest stuff we could talk about
that later later anyway we've got a
bunch of great topics for you guys today
we're gonna be talking about the new a
core core i9 MacBook Pro of course I
have some sort of mixed thoughts on this
machine we've yet to get one in the
office but I've been following the
latest developments pretty closely we're
also going to be talking about YouTube's
controversial move to change the
subscriber counter so it's harder to
tell just how many subscribers a channel
has what else we got we got NVIDIA super
something they teased something on
social media they released a YouTube
video I don't know if I want to give
them attention for that okay we're not
good we're not gonna tell no we'll talk
about at all we'll talk about it's just
gonna be me ranting angrily instead of
actually specula you can speculate I
can't wait all right what else we got
oh well we got the Huawei nonsense oh
good we could talk about that 5g so many
things and first but first we've got the
intro see you later
there's music yeah I always I never know
because you play the intro it's like do
we keep talking they can hear us talking
right now oh yeah they can hear us
talking it's just it's one of those
things that we could fix but we did
Corsair wait what birthday
Squarespace madrina madrina scoffs hey
madrenas is a sponsor well they can't
see you reaching it like that well
that's why I tried to make it extra loud
all right guys so why don't we jump
right into our oh shoot I think I left
the title wrong on a floatplane pour
flow plane never mind never mind it's
great to refresh the tab freaking
awesome of you so much all right
oh oh wow it is so terrible
oh that Luke isn't here today no no no I
mean it's um wow that came across wrong
we're adding co-host the man show with
lioness to the things right yeah
so the reference I'm making there guys
is on Riley's first win show I made a
joke that he wasn't the FIDE to review
the r-tx 2080 and people got upset
because it wasn't a joke he's not and
the dance is that I am qualified to
review it badly so if you don't want
that look everyone here has their
different specialties
Anthony's our GPU guy he's more
qualified than either of us I was just
poking fun at Riley so that's that's the
reference I'm making here maybe we just
shouldn't you shouldn't just we
shouldn't even address that but Riley
right the thing that you're not
qualified to talk about compared to my
usual photos is actually the latest by
creators for creators video streaming
service that popped up on the internet I
have I heard about this I doubt it it
actually it happened pretty quietly and
I'm just I'm trying to remember what
it's called right now ah yes here we go
here we go so I really I wish Luke was
here because we would have a lot to say
about this but guess what there is
another
creator created video service out there
now so they've got a handful of creators
including minutephysics scishow who else
is on here low spec gamers these guys
are all on it
these yet these guys are all on it ding
this isn't actually we have a new
archenemy up oh no I wouldn't I wouldn't
say that at all like their shtick is
honestly so different from floatplane
that I couldn't be I couldn't be less
concerned about it like it's when when
do we launch a concentrated strike a
concentrated strike when do we send the
Strikeforce I'm just kidding
love all of you guys so their Jam is
that it's mostly like science and
intellectual creators so I like us I'm
kind of thinking that our strike force
probably doesn't have to be that
hardcore
oh I'm generalizing I'm generalizing I
should we would have the gadgets I
shouldn't like they're just like sitting
there in coffee shops thinking about
like the questions of the universe and
we're like you know building weapons I
don't think we have much capacity to
build weapons either in fact I would
give them more weapon building street
cred than Venice for sure maybe maybe
okay look I sure wish this was a night I
turned it right right from the get-go
into something where they have to be
enemies we can be friends you know you
this is this problem what are you this
is the problem with not just having
proper USB ports on laptops oh you're
right you got an adapter you got a
dongle yeah I think this dongle hub is
broke you're trying to live that dongle
life right back in the moment and
gentlemen and this in addition to the
fact that eight cores is too much not
well it's not too much it's too much for
an Apple laptop
there's also why you don't buy the Apple
MacBook Pro because they don't have
enough USB port we'll talk about that
we'll talk about that later
I'm upset okay here we go let's try this
again stupid but there it goes angle is
rubbish you're right back to seven tune
back this dongle is that hey Colton got
a bad dongle yes
bad bad dongle to de waste pile
he weighs putt oh oh he stepped on it I
mean I wouldn't use the word stomp
colton's an absolute mad leg I
definitely wouldn't use the word crush
but step step yes
boom rusted alright what is it you're
trying to login
no no I wouldn't honestly okay so
speaking honestly yeah no I do not
consider this a competitor and I don't
mean that in like a like a casting shape
ever be at our level I just mean that
it's really really different from what
we're doing so I signed up for a trial
account they have a 7-day trial and I
was obviously really curious let me just
make sure that this is muted yep good I
was obviously really curious to see how
they've got it set up like what's there
what's their stick right so it looks
like one of the things that they're
using to stand out so you can really see
from the categories explainers history
music science and engineering technology
writing like they're really focused on
like like kind of stem categories right
and then also music and gaming and
filming TV yeah this would be good to
have Luke here for this and then they've
also got originals so van test Auto has
done some originals
Isaac Arthur has done some originals
Polyphonic has done some originals I
mean they just launched so honestly
there's not there's not a ton going on
right now touchscreen works to scroll
through this this deal though so that's
that's pretty cool
I can do that see huh check that out let
me just see CGP grey we'll go ahead and
click on that so you can see people are
uploading some of their back catalogue
but it seems to be right now mostly oh
interesting okay so I do know that CGP
grey has some involvement with the
project he appears to be listed as a
I don't want to get the terminology
wrong I want to say co-founder one of
the big honchos one of the big cheese's
what is this oh no I don't want contact
us I want about us yeah I got it cookies
about we're talking about them right now
here we go here we go hold on a second
yes community co-founded yes co-founded
by Dave wiskus CGP grey and Philip
Detmer so you can see here that he's
actually got videos on here that this is
8 years ago though there's no way they
were working on this 8 years ago so I
had seen one from him that said a year
ago and that was the oldest video that
I'd seen but I think that might just be
an older video of his that maybe is from
like I don't know patreon or something
like right oh and maybe you can manually
key in a date these are all I don't know
exactly what they are so I've only spent
a few minutes poking around I'm not
gonna actually play any of the content
because we don't want to guys go get in
trouble go get your own trial yeah like
I'm not I'm not trying to get in trouble
or anything here but basically these
guys are taking a completely different
approach so they're doing $5.00 a month
that subscribes you to the entire site
whereas for us we evaluated the model of
a per site subscription and couldn't
really find a way to make that make
sense right so maybe they've obviously
we're going to be looking further into
what exactly they're doing so maybe
they've figured out something that we
haven't but hopefully that goes really
well so we're doing a per creator
subscription more like what someone like
a patreon is doing and the other thing
is that they're going invite-only so
it's supposed to be like a curated list
of creators that are kind of educational
and this actually ties in really well
with a video that veritasium released
earlier this week talking about the
changes in the YouTube algorithm and how
they affect creators was a really
good video did you watch it yeah oh good
that's good because it was in the
writers meeting notes as required
viewing I watched it before you told us
to watch it did you actually actually
excellent ahead of the curve so as a
recap Derek from veritasium basically
made a viral video super viral 33
million views or something crazy like
that and then a couple days later did a
post-mortem on why and how that video
went viral and how YouTube's algorithmic
I don't want to call it favoritism but
how YouTube's algorithmic tendencies
tend to be towards videos that just get
an excellent click-through rate a lot of
tiny balls in the thumbnail yeah or just
anything else that's very enticing in
the thumbnail because at the end of the
day YouTube wants to keep people
watching on the site as often as
possible and for as long as possible
that's how Google makes money through
YouTube if the more ads you watch so
much the better so you kind of went so
here's the thing you're more niche
content or you're kind of more dry
sciency boring explaining content that
gets you know four percent of the people
who see an impression for it to click on
it is just not going to get that prime
real estate the way that something more
sensational that gets 25 percent of the
people to click on it will right and you
can't blame YouTube for that they want
people to watch videos that's the way
that the algorithm decides is the best
way to serve people the content that
they want to watch but it still means
that for people who are not not able or
not willing to engage in the whole you
know
we fold our backyard with Thai beanie
babies or bread whatever like that kind
which is very interest a dumptruck of
Thai beanie babies from a scientific
perspective yes very proud of you know
the ragdoll physics and so people like
that are looking for a way out of the
algorithm
and one of the things that watch nebula
dot-com says is there's no algorithm and
that makes sense given that this is yai
given that this is like a curated list
of supposed to be educational or
intellectual creators for sort of uh I
don't know whatever kind of audience
would want that sort of their anti
algorithm yes they're they're anti
algorithm I mean the cold hard truth is
that even if they wanted an algorithm
that's a lot of Hardy that's true oh
yeah yeah they're like we're doing it
it's a choice yeah but at an algorithm
it's easy we could have done it I mean
yeah it's it's one of those things where
floatplane is also anti algorithm the
way that we see it a creators page right
it's that's their page
that's not our page to advertise other
creators especially because on
floatplane you're paying per creator so
it's not like you'd be able to watch
that other creator anyway exactly but
also the cold hard truth is that even a
floatplane wanted to build a recommended
algorithm we would be we would be a
decade away from anything approaching
the sophistication of what someone like
a YouTube is doing I could start working
on that right you got this yeah no
problem
I watched the YouTube trending page a
bunch I know how it works so 225 perfect
says patreon support helps to bypass the
algorithm at least somewhat that may be
the case but patreon is always going to
be limited well not always I mean they
could fix it I guess but for now they're
limited in one key way they don't have a
way to economically serve video they
don't have a way to economically serve
video on their site so they're never
gonna be a one-stop shop right and that
was what we identified for flow plane
and that's what the if I can bias a tree
on and a video Platts what the standard
shows team seems to have identified for
watch nebula com I've seen where you're
going to want a way to both engage with
the creator and support them and
actually consume the content right in
one place so for my part I wish them the
best of luck I think that there is a ton
of room for alternate
video platforms I think that I mean I
also have concerns about fragmentation I
think that's definitely something that
stands to become a problem if this and
floatplane there's a million and the one
Jordan Peterson is allegedly working on
and like if there's a bunch of people
who see flow plane and they're like we
should do that you know that's that's a
problem but at least they saw that we
were first are we whereas it looks like
they've launched before we formally long
yeah we you can go sign up for flow
plane right now is true that is I mean
can yes I don't know yeah it's it's too
bad Luke's here not here because he can
probably he'd probably be even more
angry than I am right now
no no I've talked to him about it
already saying I'm really mad why are
you so determined to be mad about this
this is my instinct i I get defensive
you know this is my tribe yeah no it's
um you better watch it guy ya know it's
it's a non-issue I mean they're okay the
tech is really different
so they're using Amazon AWS for their
back-end we've already dug into that
they are that one of the key points of
differentiation seems to be originals
that's not something that's a major
focus for floatplane it's more like okay
behind the scenes right and early access
that's where we kind of see the value
but the way that I think creators are
gonna see it is they could use either of
these as just like a toolbox of sorts
anyway I suspect that I haven't actually
seen their creator agreement of I'd be
fascinated to obviously but I suspect
they don't lock people into a particular
way of using it because they describe
themselves as a toolbox the same way
that we do so you could probably upload
early access stuff there if you wanted
so our other major point of
differentiation is video quality and
that's something where because they're
on AWS the either can't or won't be
competitive with YouTube on so they're
1080p is three megabit do you have
context for that okay yeah that's pretty
low so to put it in
I knew it I knew it was probably low
yeah youtubes is somewhere in the
neighborhood of I think eight to eight
if I recall correctly so more than
double and it does make a noticeable
difference
our 1080p is I believe closer to 15 so
it's closer to the bitrate of YouTube's
1080 which is why
excuse me 4k so that's why I floatplane
at 1080 looks as good as YouTube at 4k
we're actually getting really close to
launching 4k for floatplane but it's
taking some time because we're honestly
not quite sure how to roll it out do you
think you can fire up a strawpoll for me
I can do that okay Riley's gonna fire up
a strawpoll here my electricians calling
sorry Brian I can't deal with that right
now what are we asking hello well we're
gonna ask people what they want to see
from floatplanes 4k because we've had
some internal debate about it so right
now our 720p already looks great because
it's competitive with 1080p bit rates on
other sites but people don't like that
they don't want to click 720p when they
have a 1080 screen right because they
feel like they're getting shortchanged
and they're not having the full
experience and you can tell them it's
720p is just as good as 1080 one or
they'll get like they'll be like look
I'm having performance problems because
I can run 1080 on Netflix in YouTube but
I can only run 720 on floatplane right
okay and the thing is you can't explain
to everyone in the world the difference
between resolution and bitrate or the
relationship between resolution and
bitrate so your resolution is just how
many pixels by how many pixels you could
have a 4k resolution image that is at
like you know a two kilobit per second
bitrate that basically just looks like
like kind of shifting colors
yeah looks like nothing like a
postmodern art project the pixels are
there but there's no information that's
the bitrate except that which you choose
to glean from it yeah through
interpretation that could be Wow
that sounds like an art piece yeah
Modern Art Museum he gets into art I
know right so then on the other side of
things the bitrate only tells you sort
of how much data stream you have to work
with you could have a very high bitrate
and a very low resolution and you reach
a point of diminishing returns like if
you're running at 240 P and then you you
know go to 60 megabit per second
contacts that's about like an HDR blu
ray gonna look pixelated and crappy but
it's gonna look really a lot better on a
4k screen no it'll look it'll look as
good as it could given the limitations
of the resolution one of those pixels
will be as good as it could be exactly
so you want to find you want to find a
balance so anyway we've got this issue
with messaging where people get upset
because they can't run the same
resolution on floatplane that they can
on other sites so in order for our 4k to
really look a lot better than our 1080p
we're looking at bit rates in the range
of 25 to 35 megabit per second and
that's getting close to a 1080p blu-ray
now the problem with that is that even
people with 50 megabit per second or 100
megabit per second connection to their
internet provider might run into
problems streaming this because of
network overhead because of nearby
neighbors who are busy you know
torrenting the Game of Thrones finale or
whatever the case may be sure and their
service isn't able to sustain that also
sometimes you can run into kind of
routing issues where it kind of goes
around or it takes a bunch of jumps and
even though you've got the the
throughput your connection quality isn't
great so you end up with buffering or
leg and as a young video serving service
that's building our own CDN rather than
using AWS for because otherwise we
wouldn't be able to do this really
really high quality we don't have
endpoints like on every block right
that's more Netflix's jam you know once
you reach that kind of a scale gotcha
so here's what I want to know okay
everyone out there not just floatplane
peeps
do you want us to a
downgrade our 1080p bitrate and then
serve a 4k file that is a slightly
higher bit rate than YouTube's 4k sir
okay
option number two leave our 1080p the
way that it is so about equivalent
YouTube's 4k and then have like a CPU
internet connection murdering 4k yeah
I'm talking like 30 30 megabit of second
like crazy stupid your internet
streaming I mean those are really the
main options because I pitched Luke on
having multiple 4k files that we could
dynamically switch between so that
people could press 4k and feel like
they're getting the 4k experience but so
that if their internet connection sucked
we'd be able to just switch over to the
lower bitrate one and he was like what
do you try to do to me
please storages expense deep do you know
how much storage caught you pay for the
storage do you really want multiple 4k
files per video I'm like okay so go
ahead and create that point yeah sure
whatever that's fine all right
so create that poll I want to know what
people want to see I'm go ahead and fry
up your screen here you want to post
that in a YouTube chat do you have the
YouTube chat open is this the link I've
never actually created it you've never
created a straw at first I guess the
last twitch what I don't have the
floatplane well I wasn't signed into
full plain because I'm not signed in on
this oh boy oh boy are you saying
anything oh here I'll put in the doc
dude type this bin okay that works that
works where you putting it very tough
very tough very tough all right I will
post it in the chat boom
it's there it's taken out taking a hot
minute there it goes
dang it I pressed refresh on the page
right as it as it's spread in here's
here's the poll guys and twitch boom all
right so that's Luke here's my
floatplane shot I'm Luke on twitch oh
all right
oh I see an interesting suggestion and
floatplane chat already how about this
how about you stream at like sort of the
you know better but not ridiculous
quality but then have the download be
available mmm in like you know murderous
quality okay so that doesn't get around
Luke's concern that we are still out
putting multiple 4k files for every
upload but I will consider it it's just
that like I said storage is really
really expensive yeah
how about codec h.265 and vp9 are quite
a bit more efficient yes that is a good
suggestion but unfortunately it's
challenging Hudson tody says why not
have a variable bitrate on the fly
instead of different files that's
complicated don't get don't don't make
me get started on that that's like
really really complicated look like
we're hiring more people but we would
need a lot of stuff for that alright so
I'm gonna go ahead I'm gonna load up the
load up the results here and we can have
a look seems like most people want us to
leave 1080p as is and just murder their
connections okay
well it looks like that's the way we're
going then why would you want I mean
most people are gonna be watching in
1080p no they won't I think most people
just click highest fully bill that must
be the highest quality way yeah and then
if they get stuttering then I feel like
they're gonna be unhappy and I mean for
me and when I'm on YouTube or anywhere
where I'm only make only go to up the
quality when I think that the quality
visibly looks not good enough like on
YouTube if I'm like this looks a little
blurry then I'll go to the quality and
check that's an interesting perspective
I used to go I think when 4k first came
out on YouTube I used to go click on
four kings I want to the highest quality
every time but now I think they also
never defaulted to 4k back when they
first rolled it out right well actually
I think if you uploaded in 4k
I'm not sure I think it kind of
intelligent intelligent Lee scaled based
I'm like what you
watch I think it really dependent I
think at that time they didn't just
automatically set people's playback to
4k because just the average computer
yeah was much slower so the the
landscape has changed a fair bit now and
YouTube does automatically select 4k
when it notices you have a screen
resolution and a connection that can
handle it just fine I see I mean another
option is always going the Netflix route
where they just don't give you the
choice it just is whatever it is what it
is yeah enjoy go go watch some crave or
don't enjoy yeah exact rave if we have
crave up here in Canada in the states
it's do they have crave crave in the
States
no it's HBO now or shit show cuz crave
is like HBO Showtime and anyway so
whatever guys don't worry about it don't
worry about it guys hey um should we
talk about like news this is news oh
well yeah you don't think standard no I
think it's important that beulah is news
I always forget that you know when show
is more kind of just about like we're
just chilling know when show is about
the news why don't we talk about YouTube
changing the subscriber counter now I
know this is something that you feel
quite passionately about this was posted
by Tech dreamer on the forum I'm just
gonna go ahead and bring up that thread
and it is obviously a very polarizing
topic Oh
subscribe negative one yeah it's funny
no well here's some behind the scenes
before we started the show I was kind of
like this doesn't seem like that big of
a deal to me and my ex was like oh
that's not what I said perfect
impression that is not what I sounded
like I sounded quite quite different
from that oh yeah
so in a nut should you want to explain
what's happening well I don't actually
entirely know what's happening but I can
try wait I'll tell you what's happening
all right tell me what you tube is
appears to be changing the way that
they're displaying subscriber counts you
can see it in the jiff that's on screen
right now they're basically going around
they're just gonna start rounding it
they've been doing it for some creators
yeah if you go on YouTube they you
you've been able to see this already
happening but now it's gonna be kind of
standard procedure for them to round to
like the nearest
whatever it is they actually give some
examples I think in this post and
they've always done it in some places
right like for example actually I'm
gonna I'm gonna pop out of it out of
this now and I'm going to jump into my
own YouTube dashboard here for a second
and yes it's jiff guys Lyon says jiff -
don't get at me why are you why are you
throwing me under the same bus you can
say gif if you want I have no problems
no I'm a Jeff person I grew up saying
jiff all right that's what I this it's
what I am but did you yeah really
I never said gif Oh see I saw my saw day
just jiff and then when I heard somebody
say gift the first time I was like what
oh but now I've learned to accept it I'm
like hey you know what you want to say
gift fine you want to say Jeff it's fine
hi see Jeff see I only switched over
when when the Creator came out and said
that really it was it was Jeff not gif
that was just a bonus for me and no no
yeah I so and then everyone got all mad
about that so just to be a troll I
started doing it because I've noticed
you said it in like them in the in the
weekly meetings yeah
cuz I didn't know you that you said it
until like a couple weeks ago or
something you said for the first time I
was like no I did switch over like we
had an argument with it in my carpool oh
who's in who are the wrong people in
your carpool James David Oh Lloyd no
yeah it's it's a jiff and you display
them on your Jurassic scarred oh you're
just doing it to be rude no no I'm just
out here trying to be a good person no
no no Jeff Jeff okay anyways submissives
yeah I was looking for a spot where you
know what it might be on mobile here we
go if a channel has 4227 subscribers the
public subscriber count' will read 4.2 k
yep so it basically just gets rid of the
last you know two or three or four
digits based on you know whether you're
in the thousands or the tens of
thousands or the millions
yes now the one exception to this is
channels that are under a thousand
subscribers those ones will still
display with complete granularity
because the
shanell behind this change which is
actually what I find most obnoxious like
none of the rest of this stuff really
matters to me the rationale behind it is
that what they're trying to prevent is
dislike bombing or excuse me
unsubscribe bombing right so there was a
recent controversy batani
versus James Charles two people about
whom I know and care nothing quite
frankly I don't really know anything
about them except their names they bathe
I read makeup people I read one article
on a particularly vapid site and it told
me everything I need to know about not
needing to know anything about any of
this but basically what happened was
there was some sort of like oh no they
didn't drama on YouTube and one of these
people I don't even know which one don't
clarify it for me I really don't care
Toddie is the good guy girl person what
no no just I I'm just joking I know what
it doesn't matter the point is the point
is one of them I think lost like two
million subscribers or something like
that over a very short period of time
yeah and so what YouTube is trying to do
is remove the the instant gratification
that people get oh you thought I was
being weird when I say good guy no
Toddie is the girl just to clarify I
don't know these are just yeah yeah I
know Katya some random assembly of
characters right not gotcha that's not
even a name okay sorry I dropped you um
okay so what they're trying to prevent
is people unsubscribe bombing and
getting that instant gratification of
seeing the subscriber number go down and
then news outlets start jumping in and
reporting on this and going they lost a
hundred and then it becomes this
negative feedback loop and at the end of
the day YouTube doesn't want people
unsubscribing right they don't want
people to stay they don't want that even
if they're unsubscribing from somebody
and subscribe
to another person well maybe they maybe
that's maybe that's a neutral but for my
perspective removing this this sort of
this insight that we have into how the
platform is operating is really
frustrating and just makes our jobs more
difficult so one of the things that one
of the tools like that she's you don't
like that YouTube is telling us about
this no what I don't like is that
YouTube is removing yet
another piece of bloody information that
we have so as well as a public because
the creators themselves still have
access to how many specific subscribers
that they have themselves yes okay so
just to be clear I still get an accurate
subscriber count within my dashboard
right but you guys will not be able to
see exactly how many subscribers I have
at Linus tech tips now the thing is
there are third-party sites like
socialblade.com that allow creators to
keep tabs on how the platform is doing
overall so we can track how many views
other creators are getting we can track
how many subscribers they are gaining or
losing and it's a really valuable tool
for figuring out what the overall trends
are on the YouTube platform without
relying on useless tools like the
YouTube trending tab which is useless
you know how I know it's useless because
of how many of my videos end up in it
they honestly aren't doing very well
like I shouldn't be trending it's
clearly not trending I don't know how
you define trending I just watched an
interesting video but the trending tab
today which was saying that in Canada
here if you're on the Canadian version
of YouTube the trending page is
completely different than it is in the
US this sure is it's all like
traditional media on the it was a video
by coffee break if you guys know who
that is but it's all like traditional
media like late-night talk shows and
like real news outlets and stuff on the
trending page and in Canada we go down
it's all youtubers yeah
yeah it's totally different so whenever
I'm down in the States I do notice that
the other funny thing is my creator
studio
app gives me a notification every time I
hit trending so when I'm in Canada oh
really like every other day I get a
stupid you're trending let your audience
know notification but I'm on yeah I'm on
Canada trending which is utterly right
whereas us trending I think might
actually matter a little bit I wonder if
like I guess oh wait they know we're
yeah they know you're getting a
notification because you're in Canada
yes but also I think we get served to
Canadian trending a lot because we're
Canadian now YouTube has told me
straight up to my face that it doesn't
matter right where you geographically
upload from in terms of how the
algorithm serves it but it might not
matter to them but maybe the algorithm
has some don't buy it because it's like
when's the last time I got a
recommendation for a technical guruji
video never yeah well I can't I couldn't
answer that questions oh yeah well
when's the last time you got a
recommendation for a technical guruji
video I don't know exactly
he's only huge with over ten million
subscribers in the tech vertical I'm
looking up who it is right but obviously
because he doesn't speak English and
he's located in Dubai
yeah he's based out of Dubai obviously
those videos don't get served to me
right now
okay that one's in a different language
that's a very extreme example but I
still don't believe that it doesn't
matter at all the social glassing is
extremely interesting yeah I forgot
about that because sociably takes
advantage of the publicly available
statistics that are there and now they
won't have access to that so we can't
even go to like we can't even stock
other channels you know it doesn't
appear to be any favorite things to do
it doesn't appear to be confirmed
whether social blade will be affected
because social blade is hooked into
YouTube's API rather than just screen
scraping the data off of the site but my
strong suspicion is that if they're
trying to prevent you know news outlets
from reporting on unsubscription bombing
they're going to remove this data from
the API as well
as sociably said anything yes they have
actually I believe the latest statements
is that they don't know how it's going
to affect them okay no it doesn't roll
out until sometime in August if I recall
correctly I just got signed out of the
dock so movie later this year it says
yeah I think I think it's August okay
yeah I think I think it's August okay
effective August okay we'll make this
more consistent by always showing
abbreviated sub counts publicly so
socialblade said upon closer look it may
affect our data display but only time
will tell
so yeah that's okay now I'm with you I'm
against it I'm against it this is this
is bad you know what else is bad I'm
upset you know what isn't bad oh I was
gonna say this segue to our sponsor yeah
well that's why I was helping you oh I
said what is bad and I was my segment
was gonna be bad it's okay you only know
it was bad so this episode is brought to
you by the corsair iron claw wireless
gaming mouse it's got a comfortable palm
grip that uses a PM w33 91 optical
sensor featuring native 18,000 DPI it's
got three methods of connection so you
can plug it in through a wire that'll
charge it you can use their slipstream
wireless technology which gives you sub
one millisecond latency and 33 feet of
range or you can use bluetooth if you
want to use it with a device that either
doesn't have room for a dongle or if you
don't want to put a dongle into it like
if you wanted to use it with your tablet
or your laptop on the go or whatever the
case may be
hmm it features up to 24 hours of
battery life and it's made for FPS and
mobile gaming with three zone RGB and a
2-year warranty you can get yours today
at the link in the video description
huh also sponsoring the show today
square space square space we use square
space no joke we actually use it both
our line of speedy group comm and lt xx
boat comm websites were built quickly
using Squarespace I'm just gonna bring
that up while TX Expo I'm gonna bring up
our updates guys Squarespace is an
all-in-one play update and I didn't
remind him oh oh look written by Colton
Potter I remember the first time I built
a PC back in 2012 Luke had to do about
85% of the work well I stared in
confusion coming from my old old school
console life preparing for the Aero 37
catastrophe that was the Diablo 3 launch
can be a tough job to build your first
rig if you don't know someone or if you
haven't watched every YouTube guide
there is that's why we're doing a PC
building workshop on the tech link says
what is this old thing oh okay cool
so we partnered with iFixit XFX free
geek and others to put together a
sizeable collection of computer hardware
for attendees to learn on the
configurations aren't going to blow you
away but they're modern enough that the
fundamentals are the same so go check it
out and that's gonna be great anyway
this website that you're looking at was
made on Squarespace at him if you
haven't heard already Squarespace makes
it easy to get your website up and
running quickly even Colton can do it
you can choose from tons of different
templates find the one that makes the
most sense and run with it and if you
need help Squarespace offers webinars
they've got a full series of help guides

madrenas clearly they weren't too
offended by the official madrenas
roaster of - Sebastian
there's still sponsor s they got roasted
a little bit yeah they did a little bit
madrenas coffee is coffee for fuel
organic cold brew coffee and convenient
15 ounce grab-and-go cans with a flavor
for everyone like this one they offer
sweet and creamy flavors like mocha or
caramel and bold flavors like their cold

I was drinking one the whole time did
you know it I did know that yes you
planted that out at the beginning of the
show as well okay
you have any questions about madrenas
slow-mo from their team is in the chat
ready to answer your questions through
direct messages hmm all right
dee-licious why don't we jump into what
was our next topic that we had lined up
here o5g could break weather forecasting
I have not heard about this yeah I have
seen like a reference to it in a couple
stories before but apparently it's like
it's actually kind of a problem and it's
also a problem because all of these
companies are racing to get to 5g first
and we're not really taking the time to
realize like or to explore what problems
this so there's no calm before this
storm hits us that we didn't see coming
the storm of great data speeds the storm
of actual like debris in the air real
storms we didn't see a coming so NASA
and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration have been sounding the
alarm that the wireless spectrum used
for 5g networks could interfere with
data collection that is used in weather
forecasting now I don't know if you've
noticed this I certainly have but
weather forecasts are sure a heck of a
lot more accurate now than they were
when I was a kid aren't they I mean back
then the joke used to basically be that
the weatherman was like and remember
this was back then so it was a
weatherman not anymore
okay now it's the weather reporter but
is meteorologist sure um so anyway back
then the joke was that just like you
know before the before the news started
the the weatherman would take a dart and
throw it out of thing and then that was
the better forecast because honestly you
know back in the late 80s early 90s they
didn't have the kind of big data that
they do now and the kinds of like super
computer-generated weather models right
that we rely on in full 3d with ray
tracing yeah so like if there was a
hurricane approaching the coast they
could be like yeah there's a hurricane
a-comin yeah but what we're working now
we were like we can do facial
recognition on it now we can do yeah
that's that's hurricane Jemima we know
well nowadays they'll be like yeah it's
gonna rain for a few hours in the
afternoon and they're probably gonna be
sunny after that like that wasn't thing
that wasn't a thing at all I didn't
check the weather when I was a kid like
so I can't really do that kind of
correct come their direct comparison I
feel like it's probably because you
didn't read the newspaper well I read
then I read the comics behind me too so
on Thursday
no as Acting Chief Neil Jacobs testified
on Capitol Hill that the interference
from new 5g wireless radios could reduce
the accuracy of weather forecasting by
as much as 30 percent that's a
significant he said this would result in
coastal residents getting two to three
fewer days to prepare for a hurricane
now how does that make sense I mean
surely like hurricanes that are two to
three days away you can collect data
like way out yeah there's not a lot of
five days I mean maybe if maybe it's if
it's close to the coast all right you
know you don't know whether it'll be a
hurricane or not and this could lead to
less accurate predictions about where
these major storms are going to make
landfall such errors in these
predictions could cost people their
lives he warned at the cost of also we
could have faster data speeds right is
it worth it the FCC began auctioning off
the 24 gigahertz spectrum in March to
wireless carriers who plan to use it for
new 5g networks and earlier this week
Democratic senators wrote a letter to
the FCC asking that the agency refrain
from issuing the licenses to auction
winners until a solution can be found
throughout this source people are asking
for it oh yeah sorry the source is CNET
and the verge you know what we're gonna
go with CNET what no I'm just a joke I'm
not biased
it's just mm it's just no I don't want
your notifications though no I like
seeing aa auto-playing videos you know
stop no space footage of storms is
amazing awe-inspiring it looks delicious
you know what's weird though is it
really looks round from here the earth
yeah we're you that's weird you a flip
oh no you know what it is
you know what it is oh is it see I
always thought that it was a rectangle
right cuz the the map on the wall in
school uh-huh but actually it's more of
a pancake that's why it looks round I
have no idea what you're talking about
now
no I was pretending to be a flatter okay
gotcha I was just messing with it so you
know how sometimes you'll pretend to be
offended so well yet that people think
you're actually offended yeah sometimes
I'll pretend to be an idiot so
effectively that people think I'm
actually an idiot that's my whole life
yeah wow this man show just got really
real 5g though anyway so the 24
gigahertz frequency band is really close
to the twenty three point eight
gigahertz that Noah uses to collect data
for weather prediction and the concern
is that they will interfere with the
sensitive sensors on satellites that are
monitoring atmospheric conditions okay
so that explains it so if we're talking
about satellites and just like general
noise and interference this is kind of
like you know a bunch of people getting
on there 5g phone and playing some pop G
all at once could result in kind of the
the weather monitoring equivalent of
someone flipping on a microwave when
you're trying to stream Netflix on a 2.4
gigahertz network right got it now I
thought the whole thing with 5g was that
it's short-range that like well I guess
in cities maybe it's more of an issue
where like it'll be blocked by things
well remember too though that regardless
of frequency if you focus the signal
enough you can get incredible range like
2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi can be used over
many kilometers if you have a
point-to-point dish set up right so
without really deep knowledge of how the
weather collection apparatus works and
can't say for certain what its range
might be yeah I don't know so one
suggestion has been that we could turn
down the power emitted by 5g wireless
radios to help prevent some of this
interference but obviously if you turn
down the power emitted by the wireless
network you're going to interfere with
it's range which I'm obviously these the
wireless carriers who just spent a lot
of money for this spectrum are not gonna
be super stoked about now I wonder I
wonder how much of this is because most
of the 5g deployment that we've seen so
far is in cities right where it's like
you know there's a node on the corner of
a building exact that will cover a
certain area like we can be fairly one
block yeah and we gotta be fairly
certain that that's not gonna like
escape out and and interfere with
something or maybe well I don't know I
don't know I feel like I've seen a lot
of talk about trying to build out an
entire 5g network that has the same kind
of coverage as 4G or LTE but I don't
think I call BS on that base yeah I made
it seem like that will be a possible or
desirable if this is true yeah I think I
think we've got to chalk that up to
typical wireless carrier nonsense I mean
you look at like the Canadian carriers
Oh coast-to-coast coverage and it's like
you know they mean coast to coast like
if you're in a major city here let's
have a look at let's have a look at the
Rogers coverage map Oh Rogers oh you
guys are adorable yeah I mean if they
connected with Rogers Wireless 5g yeah
yeah
so Canada's a pretty big country and oh
my gosh BC is so bad yeah the white
parts are not covered only the yellow
parts are covered so it's like yeah the
important areas like Toronto the
center's the center of Canada yeah you
know newsflash the center of Canada is
more like here right northern Manitoba
we should be paying more attention to
Manitoba yeah you know hey Manitoba
Manitobans in the chat represent if
you're in rural Quebec you are like you
better hope you have a landline because
you certainly don't have wireless
coverage actually no Rodgers is
particularly bad back east frequency
spectrum is 5g going to operate in 24
Giga Hertz yes um we've got another
topic now you really wanted to talk
about this let's go ahead and fire up
the video what did I want to talk about
well no you wanted to talk about it I'm
gonna let you talk about it so this
isn't videos teaser video this could be
an uber card uber means super did you
know I don't want you talking about
that's a German oh okay yes Eber not
uber like the cars all right we have no
idea what that's gonna be
it's a cryptic tweet talking about some
kind of product that has super in the
name or on the physical product or you
said you wanted to speculate did I did I
did not say that but we can speculate
all right you go first it's probably a
graphics card so it was posted RTX 28 ET
i it was posted from the g-force account
yes which would suggest that it has
something to do with PC gaming hmm
however new shield super shield that's
actually I think we're Soldier Serum
shields this is gonna be a but you know
like Captain America Captain America has
got the Super Soldier Serum yeah yeah
you know about that
it's been a while yeah so they're gonna
have a shield Nvidia shield wait they
also have shield yeah in in Marvel
videos a different Android TV it's a
shield okay are there not super there I
don't know I hope not okay here's my
prediction yep it's not a new product at
all hold on I'm gonna bring up the video
again real quick here okay not a new
product at all and you know to because
you have inside information but rather
yeah everyone knows Linus Media Group is
wholly owned by and this is our parent
comes in play there's a shocking number
of people who actually seem to believe
that yeah okay so look at look at this
look at this hold on hold on I think
that this is in an intentional typo and
that this is going to be a collaboration
with the C C do you get a supreme vibe
from that because it's a different farm
hold on hold on is it that different
okay hold on hold on we're gonna switch
where it where is it where it okay here
we go here we go okay ABS dude
so that is
some frame oh crap super supreme lioness
okay they're pretty different one font
is serif one is sans-serif I'm going
gravy I'm going with super aim graphics
card superest super super e it's pretty
super e super super super I don't think
so I saw a couple of people online
saying that let's go ever Asian with
supreme I don't think so I mean James
James says what could it be though
software hmm so we know AMD is probably
gonna launch new GPUs okay we've had a
leak about Navi GPUs so they're probably
gonna talk about those at Computex so
nvidia probably posted this to steal
some of their thunder and it's i mean my
best guess my best I'm I'm I don't put
money on things but if I did I would
probably say that it's some sort of
supercharged r-tx 20 80 TI because
there's already a Titan RT X so the last
time Nvidia used super in their branding
and I'm not talking about o EVGA with
their super overclocked cards was super
phones this was back in 2012-2013 so
here's here's a CNET video about an
Nvidia super phone I remember them
actually bringing 102 our office at NCI
X is this like the alright cuz they were
like okay this we've had the smart phone
now it's the time for the next evolution
the super super phone yes oh man forget
it we're not we're not doing this ads
okay whatever anyway the point was they
were gonna put their Tegra processors in
phones right and their tiger processors
weren't particularly amazing on the CPU
side of things but they had Nvidia
graphics technology and them so they
were gonna be great for gaming right and
super phones I believe a couple of
phones did actually end up getting at
least announced with Tegra processors in
them but then it never went anywhere
like it was it was a complete it was a
complete dead end the iPhone was just
completely gone there at that time yeah
this is way back like that's like it's a
year that I start
and it was it was dead by 2013 it was
like a 2012 kind of kind of thing that
they were talking about so that to me
might suggest that if they wanted like a
super tablet that might be something to
do oh maybe this is the because we've
had a couple leaks and rumors this year
about a new shield gaming yep portable
device so maybe it's a refresh to shield
based on like they're super but what a
dumb name though well that's why I was
like oh if it's a graphics card I can
see that because like what else you know
they've got the tea eyes they've got the
SC's they got those C's like how many
how many more things can we put on to on
the end of GPU names super is like super
edition I'm like okay it's a weird
adjective is it any Dumber
word then like is it any dumber than
Captain America that was a joke this
super serum or what like no no Captain
America is not a joke don't use a very
serious character I agree I was just
gonna say don't you badmouth Captain
America I just mean is it any dumber
than that he's a hero
is it any dumber than Batman like wow so
it from my perspective the validity of a
brand really comes from how good the
product is rather than the other way
around right it's not like you decide
that a product is good based on hearing
the name that makes you feel like I can
decide that the product names dumb
without knowing what the product is
right but over time i postulate that's
doable in a second yeah I bet you've
accepted what a stupid name kijiji is
now I've never used Kijiji and I still
think it's done okay what about iPad
have you accepted iPad I mean I accept
it as a fact of life we all we all
thought it sounded like feminine hygiene
products at the time I was last time you
thought okay how about this do you
accept how Apple refers to its products
without articles like they don't say the
MacBook Pro a Mac no I actually do not
accept that
okay well iPhone is an amazing
experience is not a proper noun Apple
this eight core process that we don't
even talk about that but this a core
processor makes macbook pro the world's
best macbook makes it okay we should
probably talk about that because that
was sort of the okay so what do i call
it then new macbook pro if i can't say
that just it's just a pro with the type
of display it has 2019 they should
really start getting creative again you
know yeah like go through a super
macbook super book Mac edition superbug
well
intel has their muscle books oh yeah
okay that's a name I decided was stupid
and that I wouldn't like the product
before it ever ever actually happened
okay so like muscle book Apple released
a new MacBook Pro with intel's new 8
core core i9 processor this is a crazy
freaking mobile chip it's not in here
don't worry about it and our immediate
reaction to this device was that if
Apple couldn't manage to tame the six
core core i9 that was in the last
generation MacBook all right cuz that
was the one that overheated it was a six
core well that was the one that had the
whole scandal around it where they
didn't have the basically the allowances
in their software to let the CPU just go
to a hundred 105 degrees without
throttling so it was it was turning down
and it was not performing the way it was
supposed to even underperforming the
quad core variant that had come before
it but they wait what they release it
with it they released an update right
they released an update that fixed it in
Mac OS but not in Windows because at the
end of the day what they were doing was
they were like kind of playing around
with the power states and playing around
with the thermal threshold to allow it
to not drop below its base clock but it
was I mean it's cooking in there yeah
it's absolutely cooking in there so we
speculated that the new a core MacBook
Pro was not going to be a better
situation for sure so we figured it was
gonna thermal throttle now Quinn from
ozzie Labs has already posted on Twitter
that it doesn't thermal throttle he says
it just manages to maintain its base
clock however I think you guys can
always expect to get the the non the
non-apple point of view from us so we
definitely have one on the way it's
already been ordered
are you messaging me right now is that
what why don't you just come in and talk
to me oh man stop that okay whatever the
point is you can always expect the the
alternate side of the coin from us so we
are going to be addressing some of the
criticisms of our last video about
Apple's thermal throttling in our review
of the MacBook Pro eight core 2019 mid
Retina whatever the stupid thing is
called so stay tuned because from my
perspective there's a lot of different
ways to define thermal throttling so
thermal okay so you can say if it
doesn't go below its base o'clock it
didn't thermal throttle that's one way
of defining it that's correct you can
also say you got your one word thermal
okay so the TV yeah you got your other
word throttle which is under morrow yeah
okay so anything other than the best
that it could possibly perform you could
make the argument is throttling now the
base claw a bit pedantic is not the same
thing as the all core boost so even if
the laptop is maintaining its base clock
per Intel spec so that's what Intel
rates it for in it with its TDP like
it's thermal rating that doesn't mean
that if that chip didn't have a better
cooling solution it couldn't perform a
lot better sure so all core boost is
what Intel rates the chip to clock up to
assuming the power and thermal overhead
is
available for it to turn itself up so
these I wonder if does Mac does Apple
have like a specific list like do they
say this is the base clock this is the
boost clock they only advertise boost if
I recall correctly only advertised but a
lot of manufacturers do that and we
criticized Apple for it and people were
like well yeah but what about and so in
our video we're gonna make a point of
also criticizing other manufacturers for
it because it's stupid regardless of
ransom because you know we talk about
Apple up but yeah I'm sure a lot of
these other you know Windows laptops
with heat intensive processors also
don't get all the way up to the boost
clocks all the time so the thing that
bothers me particularly about Apple is
and Quinn actually talked about this in
his tweets they advertised a boost clock
that that chip is just never gonna see
mmm Apple does yeah right because they
advertised the boost clocks but he's
saying that it doesn't even barely gets
past the base clock so the maximum boost
clock is based on a single core or a two
core load and the base clock is based on
the minimum that it should run at at
that thermal rating that Intel assigns
to the processor for all course being
loaded so they're completely different
measures but what he said was that it
manages to maintain base clock in an all
core load and he didn't manage to see it
hit its maximum advertised boost clock
pretty much at all but if it if it if it
works fine and if you you know you can
go in GarageBand and make your little
songs then it what's what's the
difference you know I'm gonna move on to
super chance cuz I'd rather talk to
someone else Richard Lehman says love
your channel it's given me many ideas
for my new computer nice no problem
Richard Carlos says nothing love you
Carlos two bucks uh tommy-gun 1928 were
you born in 1928 I thought that was the
question we don't have a lot of we don't
have a lot of elderly viewers but
tommy gun alright hey Linus what laptop
are using during when this is an HP
something elite book of some sort I
don't know it's not great it's a fancy
laptop I'm not gonna recommend it do you
have on e giorgio oh oh my daily drive a
razor blade stealth but I don't know if
I'm gonna recommend that either because
it's the old one not the new one I don't
really it's a new one that much I need
to find a new laptop that is like my
go-to I use the LG Graham 17 that looks
pretty cool I really wish I had a
touchscreen yeah I'd be super into it if
it had a touchscreen you're like Riley
that's my Graham now sorry you could
that's fine
Eric thoughts on Thunderbolt 3 for
phones I don't really have any I sound
like unnecessary power consumption to me
I don't know what yeah I don't know why
you would I mean unless you want to use
your phone as like a super powered flash
drive or something USB 3 type C already
has many many of the benefits of a
Thunderbolt 3 port like if you wanted to
run an external display and some
peripherals or whatever often you can
already do that so maybe that'll be
important if when Android cue comes out
cuz it might have a desktop mode even
then you could use type C for that yeah
you're displaying your peripherals
you're networking it's like this right
here is not a fundable dongle it's just
a USB type-c dongle it got your HDMI you
got your three USB ports you've got your
power pass-through you got your Gigabit
LAN you got your microSD and your SD
card reader like this is all I could
possibly want on a phone and it's ugly
and it's pink isn't it so that's fun
yeah I like it
rose-gold excuse me sorry sorry Jeremy
says YouTube premium gave me a free
super chat to sent yay
Benny says what do you think the best
monitor is I think the best monitor is
coming and I need to make sure it's not
under embargo before I tell you guys but
it's good to be one moment please
the best monitor like out of every
single option there is that's a that's a
bold I'm going to try and make I'm going
for for gaming just because that's like
what I assume they're asking that 4k 144
Hertz g-sync
this embargo doesn't say anything about
an embargo so I'm going with it a soos
has their PG 35 vq coming so it's a 34
40 by 1440 ultra wide that does 200
hertz and has like oh I don't know a
bunch of bunch of dimming zones and HDR
up the but they make all that good stuff
so I'm going 100 Hertz I'm finally
getting an upgrade for my Predator X 34
it's gonna be bigger a nice creamy
batter you already have one over there
ask these things on the web show
Jamaican says hi Riley what's up dude
Mikkel say yeah he can't respond so I
don't I'm just saying what's up Mikkel
says quick question my computer will be
an idle while the mother is on or off
the computer will start revving really
hard and the only way I can get it back
to work again is if I do a hard reset
have you ever experienced this problem
Mike no I've not experienced that
problem hey check did posted in the
forum yeah that would be a really good
idea post online a section Stockholm for
him other side guy says collab with
Mighty Car Mods of when I'm Alex would
die he would love it yeah I'd be pretty
sick actually Andrew says my girlfriend
won't let me buy LT t-shirts saying I
have too many look at this are you
looking into making other ltte apparel
such as pants socks and monkeys well
this is another shirt that's another
shirt that's our new cpu design yeah we
also have the water bottles back in
stock LT t store calm we have hats
we got hats dude we're gonna have boxers
soon can you see the logo know about the
boxers right I do have you seen them now
I haven't seen them oh they're sick do I
have them on me oh we have a thing we
have a box we have a box full of I was
supposed to talk about this I'm gonna
get in trouble
no all the boxers are doing here yeah
boxers aren't in there velcro straps
with ties Jonathan says why not 1440p
next
is actually a most excellent idea we
could do that on float plane it still
wouldn't address people being upset that
well my 4k works yeah if you got a 4k
monitor you're gonna be like 40 40 P
Michael says go with super quality but
just call it low medium high and ultra
Oh huh so we could take like like um but
that's deceitful what is it Duke Nukem
or whatever where you've just got like
like like instead of you know low medium
high you've got like hurt me plenty and
like I kinda yeah yeah false advertising
I think it's called it burns my P you
know okay don't you shouldn't say that
on the show dude that's private Riley
doesn't know what are the odds I feel
like if we had looked at that at the
time never tell me the odds it's my damn
big more sense jiff is for the
uncultured do you have a response
I have no reason why you what happened
in your life that you want to be mean to
people like that that's my response Jos
Galen says many US carriers limit to 1.5
megabit for a second yeah we have
separate files for mobile don't worry
it's okay Chris says have you tried the
quest what do you think so we gonna try
it I honestly didn't care
everyone's saying it's really good and I
know that we don't do that much of er
stuff anymore and I'm not gonna say
let's do VR stuff but it's like everyone
loves it don't do a ton of mobile VR
stuff cuz it's apparently it's really
good all right fine
you're on it nice that's your next
assignment okay Riley's on it sick dude
can you add it to Trello alright right
now doing I'm not signed into anything
so I can't but Zion says GeForce
experience with ray-tracing update for
superior performance look at the light
shading and rendering in the teaser I
think the Nvidia makes all their teasers
look sexy regardless of what the tech is
oh he's saying the super yeah what so
it's gonna be he's saying that it's
gonna be super is going to be an update
to ray tracing yeah I kind of does it
maybe here's another one here's the
money I got from buying YouTube red says
Keon
nice tech support says super is a dumb
name but so is Linus tech tips
I don't even disagree D says Corey Lal
you don't know I just tried it tonight
I'm waiting so not wait people are
sending super chats to talk to other
people in the chat okay I'm waiting for
the marriage proposal then oh man like
I've seen you in the Super chats it's
like a like a personal class what do you
call this the personals classifieds
no no that's personals person yeah like
I saw you on the bus let's get a coffee
hey Jess says Apple mentions both base
and boost clock so for the video we're
gonna go through we're gonna research it
thoroughly don't worry we're gonna have
some fun with it speaking of having fun
it's time for me to go home and have
some fun packing yeah that computer
Taiwan how did you get out of it for
clickbait yeah I think I made an
argument that it might not be worth it
well right and then it was gonna cost me
like a couple grand to send you there
yeah and I'll probably just end up kind
of like doing the same thing that I do
here mostly anyway so maybe the next
event but like it's a one-day the thing
is it's a one-day production cycle so
it's like it's hard to do anytime you're
on it and I've gone to many events and
done tech link now I don't know what I'm
in for
yeah there's gonna be there's apparently
gonna be some hardware announcements but
we'll see okay be maybe a new Xbox I'll
go to you three we talked about it we
also know that there's like switch
refreshes supposedly coming Sony
announced the PlayStation 5 yeah but
they're not gonna reveal that until so
which i think is coming after e3 and
xbox might be coming at e3
which one is it Sony that for the first
time ever isn't gonna have any three
presence at all yes yeah okay so they're
not gonna be they're definitely not
doing it then again maybe they'll maybe
they'll throw their own e3 down the
street I think they did that that's like
the biggest thing ever I still remember
when Nvidia launched g-sync
AMD had their own event literally at the
hotel down the street and they were lit
did they even have freesync yet no
there's a
look we got stuff though they were just
like here look at this graphics card
yeah and because everyone had traveled
there on invidious dime it was like
right really kind of rude but then in
video was super petty about it now I
haven't verified this so it might not be
true but I heard other editors telling
me that Nvidia had someone outside the
hotel watching who was leaving to go to
the AMD thing or not it's amazing it's
amazing you would think these are like
adults I mean I don't know I it's fair
enough and II also like named their
products like you know the X 399 and
yeah rise in 3 5 &amp;amp; 7 and they might be
naming their new GPUs have you seen this
rx 3080 really an RX 37 t they might
they might that's that's the rumor but
we hope not because they already created
enough trouble when they called thread
rippers chipset x3 19 right because
index 299 but then X 299 was stupid
because they went from X 58 to X okay so
hold on let's go way back you got your X
38 your X 48 your X 58 so there's a bit
of a pattern here at 68 nowhere to be
seen
you got your X 79 oh yeah okay and then
89 we went six 90 X 99 yeah then we just
arbitrarily went to X to 999 instead of
like x1 so maybe Intel's plan is to go
x4 99 and leapfrog I don't know it's
their children everyone is children
that's dumb if there's anything I've
learned in life it's that you you get
you're born born you can go to
elementary school yeah and that's it and
it's just from there on yeah you become
a bigger fourth grader that's the amount
of maturity that you reach and that's if
you're aligned and that's the way I like
it
alright so tune in next week same
bat-time same bat-channel
I will be in Taiwan so I don't know
who's gonna be hosting it but it'll be
someone cool maybe Riley cuz he's not
going ranch oh yeah why Geoff oh yeah
maybe do you guys see ya later and you
got to make sure that you hit the right
button yeah yeah when you end it yeah
yeah no no I already changed the default
behavior wait no no
and this one this one I press oh no I
know how to do that yeah well that's
what I did that's enough that's a
non-issue yeah so yeah now that I'm you
in this I dropped the couch first yeah
there was another problem last night
actually at least that no no not that
there was an other more different
problem it was actually that this button
make archive unlisted when complete was
checked by default for a while so that's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
