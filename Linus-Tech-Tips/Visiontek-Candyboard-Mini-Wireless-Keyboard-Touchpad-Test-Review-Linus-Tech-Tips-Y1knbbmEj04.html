video for a while this is the vision
tech candy board that I had a look at a
little while back you know the one with
the on/off switch here and the built-in
cat toy
I mean laser pointer in the end of it so
compelling reason to get a candy board
well it replaces a huge keyboard and
mouse at a media PC so it's about the
size actually even a little bit smaller
than a media center keyboard and it's
got all of the keyboard and mouse
functionality that you can need so as
you can see my ghetto media center is
set up over here so we're gonna do a
quick set-up guide which should be
fairly straightforward basically you
pulled the little USB receiver out of
the candy board like so then you walk
over to the computer and plug it in the
driver installs and when I did this at
work and actually didn't take very long
at all and you tell the cat to go away
apparently he wants to visit me right
now I ramble okay it's enough visiting
with the cat so my device is ready to
use which you can see there and I'm
gonna go ahead and demonstrate how to
use it so I'm going to put my camera
that'll work and then I guess I can zoom
in a little bit
okay so with the candy board I can move
the mouse oh well not quite hold on wait
for it okay a USB input device yeah okay
hopefully the battery's not dead or
anything like that so what happens if I
press the windows button I might have to
come back in just a moment here oh well
don't know that I saw another night yeah
there we go okay so the green light went
on on the candy board and now I can
actually move the mouse around with the
touchpad so I'm gonna go
and go down to the windows button and
then I can click on it by pushing on the
touchpad and then maybe I'd want to open
up oh I don't know solitaire and then I
could play solitaire from my couch with
the candy board if I so desired okay so
that's enough of just looking at the
screen but I just want to show you sort
of the ergonomics of the candy board
itself now one thing that was a bit of a
challenge for me was the fact that the
left side is quite accessible like I can
easily type with the entire left side of
the keyboard using my left thumb but I
found it a bit of a challenge to type on
the right side of the keyboard using my
right thumb because I can't quite reach
over the touchpad so if you have large
hands I would probably be a little bit
easier for you alternately you could
hold it like this or even just put it
down on the table in front of you and
then you can just hunt and pack it type
like that and that might be the easiest
thing now one of the other cool features
of this candy board is oh where did it
go I remember I found the Oh wonder what
that button does I don't know it's like
the explosion button did it I found it
when I did the unboxing but now I appear
to have lost it but there's a button to
rotate the touchpad 90 degrees and well
I'm going to pause well I find that hi
here it is so function and then this
blue button here will make the touchpad
not rotate hold on if you have to hold
function yeah there we go so now you can
use it more like in the shape of a
remote so I'm gonna go ahead and zoom in
on the screen again yeah I know so now I
can move the mouse up and down like this
and it makes it a little bit more
ergonomic too to hold it that way and
there's a cat who apparently really
wants attention
he loves the candy board too as you can
see ramble is a big fan of the candy
board now he's a big fan
my lap he's sitting there so there you
go
cats love the candy board they will
nuzzle it and bite it don't like the
candy board okay so that was pretty much
all I wanted to say about it basically
what it is is it's a convenient way to
access all of your essential media
functions with something that's a lot
smaller than a standard keyboard I mean
this is even already quite a small
keyboard and it works quite well I mean
the range is enough that I can sit on my
couch over here and I can comfortably
control everything on the screen and
you've got pretty much every key that
you could need
there's your left and right click
there's your arrow buttons as well as
you've even got like things like page up
and page down which is great for reading
webpages so if you wanted to just it's
not something that I'd really recommend
for extensive use of your computer but
if you just want to like open up a web
browser type in a web address and then
you know just read a couple articles on
your on your media PC I mean something
like this is great so thank you for
checking out my how-to video on the
vision tech candy board and also don't
forget it is a phenomenal cat toy and
cats love it okay Rumble what's this hey
cat
what are you playing this down there go
go get that go get the laser
okay that's enough laser pointer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
