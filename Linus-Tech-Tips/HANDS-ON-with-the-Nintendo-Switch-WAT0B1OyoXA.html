their switch page but it hasn't been all
that useful their CPU and GPU are
currently listed as NVIDIA customized
Tegra processor which could be a rather
wide range of performance and they've
also told some publications that it's
clock speed is halfed when you take it
out of the dock although they told me
today that nothing changes when it's
undocked so not really sure what's going
on there

below the screen is a 720p six point two
inch capacitive panel although I don't
know if it's just like a really good TN
panel or if it's some IPS technology
going on on top of the console amongst
the power button volume buttons and an
audio jack for connecting headphones
microphones and headsets there's a game
card slot on the back side there's a
kickstand you can prop the console up a
micro SD card slot that is compatible
with micro SD micro SDHC and make your
SDXC memory cards and well has been
quoted multiple times that it only
supports up to 256 gig cards recent
statements from nintendo states that up
to two terabyte cards will work just
fine once they're available and then at
the very bottom there is a USB type-c
connector this can be used to connect
devices such as an AC adapter a battery
bank or a Nintendo switch dock with the
Joye con controllers attached to the
rails located on the side of the console
it will weigh just 398 grams internally
there is 32 gigabytes of internal
storage and a portion of that is
reserved for the system so you don't
have a ton of room to play with and it's
fairly expected that you will get an SD
card to the point where the game case
that they're selling that I've seen so
far has two SD card slots in it it has a
40 310 million power battery and it is
not user replaceable at all if the
battery does need to be replaced
Nintendo will offer a paid replacement
through Nintendo customer support set
battery will take three hours to charge
and will last roughly three hours in
Zelda breadth of the wild but is quoted
to last over six hours if software and
usage conditions are optimal the switch
can be used in handheld mode
similar to something like a gameboy
tabletop mode if you're away from home
and playing with friends or simply don't
want to hold on to it and last but not
least TV mode where you would connect
the console to the dock the dock itself
features two USB ports on the side which
can be used to charge various wireless
controllers or support something like an
Ethernet over USB adapter and of course
in the base of the unit there's a USB
type-c connector to connect the console
moving to the back which I actually kind
of got in a lot of trouble for trying to
open at the event there's an AC adapter
an HDMI port and a single USB port which
is currently set to 2.0 but has 3.0
support plans for the future now this is
purely speculation but considering the
dock is essentially a nicely stylized
USB type-c hub plus a place to hold your
switch I can see third-party options
coming around that are just essentially
breakout cables essentially you could
have a really value option of just a USB
type-c cable to your console that breaks
out to AC wall power and HDMI out it
doesn't have as many features and you'd
have to lay the console down but it
would work and it would be nice and
cheap compared to the $90 price tag of
the Nintendo switch dock the joy con
controllers will come in a standard gray
color or neon blue and neon red they
have approximately 20 hours of battery
life and can charge to full in 3.5 hours
to charge them you need to rail them
onto the side of the switch console
itself if it's docked they'll discharge
up right away and if it's undock they
won't charge unless they are
specifically at very low battery they
have HD Rumble for precise vibrations
and weigh roughly 50 grams each with the
right side controller having NFC for
amiibo support and an IR motion camera
just in case you want to play like
rock-paper-scissors or something also
the battery is again not user
replaceable and will have to be a paid
service from Nintendo included in the
box are also some joy con straps which
must be railed into each controller and
feature enhanced shoulder buttons there
is also the option for the joy con grip
the one included with the system has no
specific features other than
pass-through for the power indicator
LEDs on the joy cons it literally just
holds them and adds some handles if you
want to be able to charge them through
the grip accessory you need to buy an
additional grip accessory that supports
charging now there has been some
confusion over how exactly the joy con
control is connected the switch itself
with a lot of the speculation being
around bluetooth this may or may not be
related but I was pulled up on stage to
play Mario Kart 8 de luxe against some
other dude I was fairly confident as
I've played my fair share of Mario Kart
8 on the Wii U and I placed myself on
the left hand
farthest from the switch console may I
add I would try to drift to the right
around a corner and would thus be thrown
directly into a wall on the left and
there was other problems like that now I
thought that is just because of this
training wheels feature that will help
bring you down the track I thought that
maybe my pro Mario Kart 8 deluxe moves
were actually screwing with the training
wheels and resulting in some weird
actions and I thought I was just above
that but no apparently it was just some
Wireless interference in the actual
showroom because of the amount of
wireless devices which consoles over
there they moved me from the other side
of the stage closer to the switch
console and bam everything worked just
fine I was able to climb from 12th place
dead last to ninth in just a few seconds
but the damage was done
the other guy came in third I lost my
pride damaged but they got me another
race a chance to redeem myself they put
me on stage against the little girl I'll
let you watch how that came out
my man Lou came up here all right for
lack of better words he just got
humiliated as luring a party to lock
drive we got to mess Joyce's blue this
is Lila she's very good by lot of ways
but the other situation is if Lila beats
you you going to be
you gotta carry that into tomorrow a
bigger bag yes never both rocks just got
bigger their boulders remain that so
good luck oh yeah I wish you the best I
really do so look for Joanna's payments
maybe for Luke's humiliation I don't
know this is Mario Kart 8 blocks
gentlemen we going to get that on the
screen
good luck sir I guess I counted I tried
to stop before the finish line I didn't
want to be a massive jerk and beat a
little girl at Mario Kart in front of
her mom on stage I turned into the wall
I let off the accelerator but it drags
me over the freakin finish line at first
I thought this was momentum and I was
rather surprised I felt horrible how
could I have done this then I realized
it was that damned training wheels
feature that I mentioned earlier in an
attempt to help me it made me continue
down the course and over the finish line
in the single most horrifying accidental
victory I have ever achieved ideally I
wanted to spend the majority of the race
in first but then let her win that would
have been the non horrible thing to do
instead I came in first this was
observed by a large percentage of the
people at the event and very few
understood that it was the training
wheels that made me win I will forever
be known as that guy who got crushed
then proceeded to join another match
against a little girl and beat her at
Mario Kart 8 on stage in front of her
mom I'm never going to outlive this and
if you're watching Lila you're awesome
good race and if I see at another event
I'm sure you'll beat me then this isn't
the most powerful piece of technology
ever and that's a bit of an
understatement unfortunately I was
unable to play breath of the while but
it apparently runs at 30fps but the
games that I did play like Mario Kart
for example did feel very smooth and
looked great even despite the 720p
resolution in handheld mode because of
stuff like their art style Nintendo
consoles aren't something that you buy
for their blazing fast performance you
buy a PC for that the ability to take
this
everywhere you go charging it off
battery banks if you need to and then
coming home and putting it on a dock for
the same quality but maybe even upgraded
to 1080p and playing on the couch is a
pretty great experience and yeah I agree
it should have included something in the
Box like switch sports or something
similar to Wii Sports and it would have
been really cool if they could have
included one to switch because that game
looks hilarious ly awesome to play with
friends like who would have thought of
milking a cow on the Nintendo switch I
don't know
but it would be fun and I expect that
game to go underappreciated because of
its premium price tag it's out of stock
everywhere as far as I can tell and
reselling pre-orders for nearly twice
the price on eBay
seems to be popular right now so maybe
wait a bit before deciding if you're
going to buy one or not but once they
are available again I definitely will
although I admit I'm a bit of a Nintendo
fanboy a high powered computer and a
modern Nintendo console have always been
a fantastic pair in my opinion and I'm
excited for what the future of the
switch has to offer</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
