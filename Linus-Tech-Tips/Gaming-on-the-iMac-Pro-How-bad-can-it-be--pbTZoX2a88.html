We didn't really touch on it's gaming potential in spite of Apple's inclusion of their fastest GPU ever in an iMac
And the reason for that is... Let's be real here:
That's a 5k display paired with what is still a vega 56; a card that's optimized for half of that resolution
But... could there be a way around it? Could there be a way to game on the iMac Pro?
Let's find out...
Right after we found out who sponsored today's video! Ha, yes, Thermaltake
the Thermaltake Core P90 tempered glass case is an angled
Open frame design featuring 5 milimeters thick glass
Three layer placement layout options
vertical GPU mounting with a riser cable included and more
Check it out in the link below
so there were a few questions that we need to answer before
we could make any value comparison
One, how much does a custom setup with a same base expect as our base model iMac pro costs?
Two, does that setup perform better or worse?
And perhaps most importantly, three.
Could we optimise that 5,000 dollar budget to get better performance?
Without sacrificing all the features that will make the iMac pro special?
So this is what we ended up with based on pricing from PC partpicker
Our first build adheres as rigidly as possible to the Apple's spec sheet
Like we couldn't find a Vega 56 variant of the Frontier edition for a true apples to apples comparison
While our second build, treats gaming as an equal priority rather as an afterthought
Using a less expensive core i9 7900x and a much faster Nvidia Titan Xp
So we gave up ECC memory, Thunderbolt 3, a nice case, and wireless peripherals
But, we still have the high resolution of the 4k DCIP display
Workstation level CPU performance with many cores
Support for an up to 128GB of RAM
And access to more professional code paths in the GPU driver compared to a consumer grade 1080ti
Running directly off the hardware right away, our choices are far superior at this price point
With the iMac pro pulling worst numbers than the equivalent hardware in Deus EX: Mankind Divided
In both DirectX 11 and DirectX 12
Middle of Earth: Shadow of War seems to be better use for Apple, and then
CSGO actually has an above our equivalent, but then below our custom build
So it should be noted that even for developers like Valve who made OpenGL a priority,
Windows is still way ahead of gaming
So gaming directly on your iMac pro not the worst experience but not a great choice
Especially since in our review, we saw that the cooling isn't capable of handling full load for long
As for productivity, we got significantly worst numbers again for CPU rendering in Blender
But we actually saw far better results for most Specviewperf
Giving us a look at the pro aspect of the Apple's Vega 56 solution
Drivers and in some cases frame buffer size can make a big difference
Because, remember that these results are in spite of the throttling under sustained workloads
That we've come to expect from the iMac pro
Let us know by the way in the comments if you would like to see separate, deeper dive into
the iMac pro's cooling. For today though the focus is for gaming so let's have a look at some of the other
solutions that we came up with. Starting with an external graphics card.
Thanks to Thunderbolt 3, we can use our Razer core or something similar so slot in a variety of aftermarket GPU
From a very similar Vega 56, all the way up to that Titan Xp, from our build. And the question here is,
How much are you gonna give up by using an external solution?
With a Titan Xp, our results are obviously worse than a normal internal PCI Express slot
Especially in DirectX 12. But it is quite a bit better than a stock GPU
And CSGO didn't seem to care that much anyway. As you might expect, our external Vega 56 results
were generally dissappointing, providing us with a bottom tier performance in almost every tests.
We even lost the pro driver codepath in the Specviewperf giving us much worse productivity performance.
So you wouldn't upgrade your iMac pro with a standard Vega 56 and other words, but
As new GPUs are arriving in the market, it's good to know that a system performance upgrade
Should be possible by this means. But bringing it back to gaming again, considering the cost of an enclosure
It's possible that you maybe better off just having a second utility PC in the house
Bringing us to our next solution, streaming. Steam in-home streaming lets you be, like me,
And have a gaming PC in your closet or somewhere out of the way, while you use your super clean setup
For both work and for play. And thankfully, it actually works a treat on MacOS
And for those for you  who don't want a deal with upfront costs of building separate tower
There's actually
