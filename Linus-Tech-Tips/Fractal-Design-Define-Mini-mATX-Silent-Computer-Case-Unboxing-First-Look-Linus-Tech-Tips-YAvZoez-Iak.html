design define mini-computer case once
again this is a belated unboxing I
probably should have done it quite a
while ago but here I am doing it now so
this is interesting
yeah stop before returning any product
please contact fractal design most
issues can be quickly and easily solved
to our North American support team neat
really easy to contact support they just
put like an actual phone number on there
oh there huh
their phone number is pretty awesome
eight five five I go frac frac nice ah
so anyway let's go ahead and open this
baby up this is the little brother of
the define r3 have a revision R and a
number after it because this is the
first mini version that they did there
was no mini version of the define R - oh
it has a few of the features of its
bigger brother including Maju vents
which basically means that you have the
option on the yeah
hockey material there you go I never do
miss it so there it is try not to break
too many things here while I quickly get
a case out of a box which is more
challenging than you guys would think
there we go so mug events which gives
you the option of either having maximum
silence so you can see they're covered
right now or you can remove the covers
and have maximum cooling with a 120 or
140 millimeter fan installed in the side
panel over the graphics card or a 120 oh
and a 120 or 140 millimeter fan
installed in the top above the CPU so in
terms of the default cooling options
they are fairly straightforward there's
your manual at him dual 120 s in the
front just like its older brother it
comes with 1 by default and then you can
add another one right there sound
dampening foam on the inside of the
front panel cover two five and a quarter
inch base these are very easy to remove
nice one of which is compatible with a
three and a half inch device should you
require one in this day and age I can't
I gots a card reader would be a
legitimate reason to have a three and a
half inch made device other than that I
can't really think of a good reason not
these are actually a little bit tricky
to get back in there we go okay fixed um
what else was there on the front oh yeah
this is cool so these are these are
filtered fans I did forget to mention
that also the reset button has been
located here the original define r2
didn't have a reset button at all I
think this is a brilliant addition
because it's really hard to hit by
accident but at least you have one in
the event that you do need one here on
the top of the case we've got our
microphone and headphone jacks we've got
our power button with a blue ring around
it indicating that the system is on as
well as a blue LED right here in the
front two USB 2.0 ports one USB 3.0 port
so yes this is a USB 3 ready case the
finish of the case is actually slightly
different from the define our 3s that
I've seen so uh yeah it's more of them
it's more of a matte finish it looks
really good actually
hey gum slick got a close-up good work
slick okay we've got a 120 millimeter
cooling fan in the back io ports four
PCI slots this stands to reason it is a
micro ATX case but you've also got an
auxilary one which you can use for like
a fan speed controller or something like
that
we've got foam padding around the bottom
mounted power supply as well as filtered
intakes on the bottom so there are up to
two 120 millimeter fans whoops including
there we go
the one that goes on your power supply
that you can use down there so let's go
ahead and get the side panels off I'll
be back in this moment so we've taken
the side panel off you can see the inner
workings of mod you vent that is the
noise dampening material on the entire
panel and then the noise dampening
material on a square of plastic that
goes on the part of the panel that you
remove so there you go mod you vent is a
very simple technology one that honestly
someone probably should have thought of
before fractal but did not that seems to
be the secret to success doesn't it so
there's the noise dampening material on
that side think of something that you
know should be obvious but no one else
and do it first and then you win so
anyway let's keep on now actually okay I
made that sound a lot simpler than it is
it's hard to do that so let's go ahead
and have a look at the internals here so
pretty straightforward case if you've
seen a define our three before we've got
all of our cable management and the
expected places so there's your bottom
mounted power supply
there's your huge cable management hole
for where the bulk of the cables are
going to go through then you have
smaller ones positioned for bottom front
panel connectors video cards anything up
here like drives for example any other
connectors at the top of the board your
8 pin power connector all positioned
sensibly we've got a medium sized CPU
cut out it's not as big as I maybe would
have liked to see but I can see what
they're doing here with these bends in
the motherboard tray they're actually
reinforcing it making it stronger in
spite of the cutout and I mean most
micro ATX boards the CPUs within a ferry
fairly narrow range because all of this
is your PCI slots and then the board
only goes from here to here so there's
not a whole lot of variants in terms of
hard drive mounting options we've got
six either three and a half inch or two
and a half inch drive sled so you can
see the three and a half inch ones have
rubber grommets and the two and a half
inch ones do not because most of the two
and a half inch drives you'd mount in a
case like this are going to be SSDs and
you're not too worried about vibration
with those because we don't have any
moving parts fractal design accessories
boss let's have a look shall we actually
no I'll save that for later I'll take
all the stuff out now just to tell you
what the devil interesting nope nope
don't look at it closely we're just
taunting them right now only taunting
haha you can't see the doll anymore
alright internal connectors we've got
our front USB - we've got our front
panel HD audio or PC 97 audio they go -
just our AC 97 rather they gotta just
stop including that front panel headers
for your power switch your power LED all
that good stuff USB 3.0 front panel
header so yes this is using an internal
header rather than a pass-through and
check this out you can actually remove
now I'm not actually going to do it I
don't think but you can remove this
entire
cage so if you want to install a super
long graphics card in here and have it
be directly cooled by the fan at the
front and then use this siphon as an
exhaust you can install a beastly
graphics card set up inside this case in
spite of its small size so that's a very
cool thing as well oh hey it's something
I didn't show you guys because I keep
thinking in terms of like you've
probably already seen a define our three
but maybe you haven't so where those
front fans actually get their airflow
from is right here so there's our vents
along both sides and we're going to go
ahead and switch over to the backside of
the case
vents along both sides so when you close
this door they aren't actually starved
they are getting plenty of airflow which
is good because fans need that all right
the back of the case probably just
barely enough space to squeeze a 24-pin
back there I wouldn't call it ample room
for cable management but they were going
for small size here and it's already not
that much smaller than a fine r3 but it
is smaller so if you have a cabinet you
want to stick it in or something like
that you're not probably about this much
off of the size of I define our three by
going with the define mini in terms of
cable management at the back besides the
the ones sort of small niggle about the
room there's also the fact that it is
very easy with all the included cable
management loops to at least keep your
cables lying flat which is one of my big
complaints you got to either have a ton
of room at the back of the motherboard
tray or you have to have really smart
cable management so that you can keep
the cables flat because if you don't
have the cable management they end up
when you go to close a side panel
they're all sticking out like this and
they cross over on each other then you
end up with that bulge on the side panel
but here we've got them positioned all
over the place here here here here here
here here here here and here
so you should be able to get them nice
and flat fan cable so only two included
fans here one in the front one 20ml one
in the back one honey melt should be
fine for most systems unless you're
building something really
high-performance in here and I think
that pretty much covers it as far as the
internals go there was that 120mm fan
mount that I talked about before when I
accidentally pulled out the filter
incorrectly there we go now it's in
properly cool okay let's show you the
fix all I never showed the finish
and panel cry alone okay there you go
brush finish on the front panel
beautiful as we've come to expect from
fractal design and then the accessories
so here is our five and a quarter to
three and a half inch front panel
adapter you can put that in there if you
want to install your card reader a
couple reusable cable ties
however these work sure they work some
way there we go and you can anchor these
and tie it into the case really neat two
of those you've also got all the screws
that you need for everything including
it including a Phillips head ziplock bag
that isn't sealed um oops
including a Phillips head so it looks
like you have pretty much everything you
need to install your computer if you
don't mind using like a ghetto
screwdriver like that interesting
um motherboard standoffs and it included
fan controller that controls up to three
fans hence the reason for them putting
in this spot right here which is just
suitable for a fan controller that has a
nice long fan control knob on it imagine
that being designed exactly for fractals
on product too often you see companies
come out with products that clearly
don't work together in spite of the fact
that they make both of them so there you
go
that is pretty much it for the define
mini don't forget to subscribe to Linus
