welcome to my video this is the first r9
290x we've got that's a non reference
card about the gigabyte Radeon r9 290x
will win force it comes with a 1040
megahertz booth clocked 4 gigs of gddr5
memory clocked at 5 gigahertz it costs
$70 more than a bass card so what do you
get for your $70 well you get this card
instead it's got a massive 6 heatpipe
triple fan win for schooler with their
triangle cool concept which is like a
pyramid-shaped block here that redirects
air flow up and then down away from the
card it has a max cooling capacity of
450 watts and I've seen it in action at
Computex it actually does it ok the card
also has a 6 pin an 8 pin PCI Express
power connector it's got a slightly
non-reference looking PCB there have
been some changes compared to my
reference cards so I'll be interested to
see how that affects overclocking in
performance and then of course you get
well the usual AMD technology so there's
bridgeless crossfire no crossfire
connector anymore goes through PCI
Express there's easy Eyefinity with 6
displays supported out of the box using
a DisplayPort hub trueaudio OpenCL 2.0
power tune and their new mantle api
which is finally here and drastically
reduces CPU bottlenecks the usual stuff
is included inside the box you got a
couple adapters driver disk etc but what
we're really interested in is the
overclocking capability of this card
with AMD's latest power tune performance
is directly affected by the GPU
temperatures and we want to see how the
r9 290x compares on air cooling with an
overclocked GTX 780 Ti now that we can
keep thermals under control and
especially now that pricing is very very
similar between this between them so
I'll be handing this over to Luke for
performance numbers I hope you guys
enjoy it
I found one overclocking this wind force
card and the over clocks are actually
quite fan speed dependent
coolers fairly strong but if you have
the fan speed fairly low it's still
gonna flush up to about 95 degrees and
you don't want it up there if you hit
around 75 percent fan speed though you
keep the temperature down quite
effectively and hit much higher core
clocks and get some really impressive
benchmarks out of this thing it smashed
the reference to 90 X which was really
nice to see I'm happy to see these
aftermarket coolers and I'm happy to see
them wreck the reference cards comment
on the video down below if you're
interested in reference cards and maybe
post on the forum you'll get more
