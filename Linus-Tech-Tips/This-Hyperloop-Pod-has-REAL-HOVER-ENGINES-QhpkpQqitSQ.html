so what if I told you that there was a
mode of transportation that not only
promised to leave planes trains and
automobiles all in the dust but to do so
with extraordinary efficiency and that
PE connectivity brought us down to Los
Angeles to take a close look at a
sponsored prototype built by a ragtag
team of reddit engineers rent Rendon
ears calling themselves our loop from
all over the world
it weighs 400 kilograms contains
hundreds of sensors and it can freaking
hover
so our loop started out in much the same
way that any online community does as a
group of passionate people on reddit
that saw that SpaceX was hosting a
Hyperloop competition and figured that
they could do it better
but unlike most online communities with
some help from SpaceX and sponsors like
tE Connectivity who provided engineering
resources sensors wiring and
manufacturing space they managed to
overcome the geographical and
communication barriers that inevitably
arise when you've got a team of over a
thousand people scattered across dozens
of countries and they actually did
something and considering that all of
these folks are volunteers one of which
even quit his job and moved to the u.s.
from India for a year what they've done
is nothing short of amazing so let's
take a closer look at the pod now if
you're not already familiar with the
Hyperloop concept the first thing you'll
probably notice is that there's no
obvious external propulsion mechanism
like a jet engine or propeller
that's because Hyperloop pods aren't
expected to be able to propel themselves
see this big plate on the back of the
pod it's called a pusher plate now in
the future pods could be launched down
the to that near hypersonic speeds then
boosted by linear induction motors
essentially making the tube a big
railgun or they could use an on board
system but for the purposes of the
competition that we're attending today
this pusher plate is used to give the
pot a colossal kick in the ass with a
stripped down Tesla and send it whipping
down the track but anyone who's ever
tried to mimic their dog sticking their
head out of a car window can probably
guess that the fiberglass nose cone over
there isn't going to solve the pods air
resistance challenges at over a thousand
kilometers per hour where air feels less
like a gentle breeze and more like the
Boston molasses tsunami of 1919 which is
a real thing by the way
get up so the proposed solution for now
is to run these pods inside a closed
tube that's being held at a near vacuum
now the clever among you have probably
also noticed that these wheels are
totally unsuitable for speed of sound
travel that's because they are only for
manual maneuvering of the pod and
emergencies these babies right here are
what actually keep the pods but from
getting as raw as minded on a dried-up
water slide that one time there are
eight of what the team affectionately
refers to as hover engines each of them
is made up of freaking strong magnets
it's a scientific term right there
arranged in what's called a hull back
array to augment the strength of the
magnetic field of the individual magnets
so when they start spinning over an
electrically conductive surface they
actually create enough lift to keep this
400 kilogram pod levitating above the
track then there are also passive
magnets on the bottom for additional
lift once the pod gets up to full speed
and while we're on the topic of magnets
they power the brakes to the pod uses
two 28-inch haulback arrays that are
configured such that they create drag as
they approach a conductive surface
without making contact so that means no
biannual brake pad replacements sorry
Napa and this is really cool too while
any pod that would hope to be used in a
working Hyperloop would need to levitate
to achieve the required efficiency our
loops design is unique in that it's
active hover engines allow it to
levitate over any conductive surface not
just inside of a specialized tube and
furthermore their gimbal mounting system
lets them be used for thrust in addition
to just lift
however this crazy levitation is super
power-hungry so much so that the team
had to do
sign and custom manufactured two of
these 2000 amp lithium polymer battery
packs these things are so powerful that
a wrench accidentally dropped inside
would essentially weld itself to the
copper busbars
then they crammed both of them into the
pod for redundancy which is where tE
Connectivity comes in through the
transmission of power and data signals
now let's talk cooling the heat
generated by the various mechanical and
electrical systems in the pod many of
which you can actually see when we pop
the hood is monitored by over 600
thermal sensors but monitoring is not
enough you got to get rid of it and
because there will be virtually no air
in the tube the solution is not as
simple as just slapping a radiator to
the front of the pod our loops answer
this liquid carbon dioxide cooling
system so at the end of each of these
little brass fittings is a super small
hole only thirteen and a half thousands
of an inch that when activated dispenses
four grams of liquid co2 per second when
that goes from the high pressure holding
tank to the low pressure near vacuum
environment the liquid co2 vaporizes
removing heaps of heat in the process
how much exactly well let's just say
that if you opened it up over a
glowing-hot toaster you'd be left with a
block of dry ice to say that there are
still a lot of engineering manufacturing
security cost and logistical problems
for Hyperloop believers to solve would
be an understatement but the work being
done here and the reason for sponsors
like tE Connectivity to get involved is
not necessarily about building a working
Hyperloop n pod tomorrow it's about
developing technologies that may end up
being deployed in completely different
ways that we haven't even imagined yet
and if we succeed in building a system
that lets commuters travel from San
Francisco to LA and as little as 35
minutes with no strip search from your
friendly local
say officer well then that's just icing
