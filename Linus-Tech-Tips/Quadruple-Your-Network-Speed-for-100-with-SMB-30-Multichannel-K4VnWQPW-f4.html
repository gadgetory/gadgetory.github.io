crap that we're using around here to
break the one gigabit network transfer
speed barrier that we've been stuck with
for the last decade well today is not
about that it's about hitting your
network at home with a much needed shot
of adrenaline on the cheap
the Scimitar RGB from coarser features
17 programmable buttons a 12000 DPI
optical sensor and a shape design for
comfort in MOBA and MMO games check out
the link in the video description to
learn more ok so the first time I tried
to do something like this was way back
in the NCIX tech tip days with this
video here I had the right idea use a
relatively inexpensive multi port
network card with multiple cables
attached to it to achieve faster
transfer speeds than what would be
possible with a single port and a single
cable but the software implementation
wasn't as mature yet and the only
scenario where I saw a real benefit was
with multiple clients hitting a single
server connected in that way all at once
today we're going to actually do what i
theorize would be freaking awesome all
those years ago and demonstrate a
point-to-point transfer speed of more
than one gigabit with about $100 worth
of Hardware off of ebay assuming that
you've already got a couple of decent
Windows 10 pcs so it starts with the
hardware shopping first you'll need a
couple of quad port network interface
cards or NICs I ended up with a couple
of HP branded Intel Pro 1000 PT cards
that I snagged for about $30 each next
you'll need a network switch that can
actually handle all of those plugs so
the four port one built into your home
router or even a standalone 8 port
desktop switch won't cut it if you want
to plug in anything else the good news
is that for this functionality you don't
need a fancy smart switch so any cheap
16 or 24 port will do we used a d-link
one that Johnny the networked guy who
helped us with this project had lying
around the last thing that you're going
to need is a teather net cables but if
that comes as a surprise to you you
probably shouldn't be taking on any
networking projects so our initial
testing actually didn't go very well we
through the two cheapo quad Network
cards into my usual test bench and my
upgraded personal rig disabled Windows
Firewall plugged in all the Ã¦ther net
cables without actually worrying about
plugging into the main router for
Internet
and then we wanted to see what would
happen the answer was nothing they
transferred at exactly gigabit speeds a
disheartening result given that Johnny
had assured me that he had gotten it to
work on his test machines with no hassle
whatsoever so we put new fresh windows
10 installs on each and not a same thing
what the heck
time to bring out the big guns so Johnny
ran home and got his custom z170 asrock
board with an intel core i5 skylake chip
in it and a random lenovo pre built with
a core i3 4130 dual core we put his
Nick's into those a couple of Intel i3 4
TT fours that are a bit more expensive
than the ones I bought but still quite
affordable and voila transfer speeds in
excess of one gigabit not particularly
impressive still and frequently dipping
below gigabit even but the important
thing that we're looking for here is
activity on all four interfaces and we
got it from there though it was time to
keep tuning we wanted to eliminate the
mechanical hard drive in the Lenovo
machine as a bottleneck so we threw a
secondary SSD in there big improvement
but still not enough we needed to do
more
so we tore apart Johnny's Lenovo machine
and put in 16 gigs of ram so we could
make a ram disk and still not the result
we needed I mean this should have been
capable of over 400 megabytes per second
so we started trying a lot of other
random stuff we wanted to boot the
lenovo hard drive off of my 8 core
machine we tried installing fresh with
Jonny's Windows 10 ISO to see if maybe
that was the issue we were having when
before when I was trying to do it and in
either of those situations the multi
channel transfers that we wanted didn't
work at all
both of us were tearing our hair out at
this point getting SMB multi-channel to
work seems to be as much about luck as
anything else and certain combination of
hardware with certain windows installs
were working while others weren't so in
the end we did manage to get Johnny's
boot SSD from his skylake personal rig
to run on my
99 testbench but we were stuck with that
Lenovo box with the core i3 the good
news is that making that change and we
actually switched back to my cheap
network cards at this point because the
340s didn't seem to be making a
difference anyway resulted in a much
faster and more consistent transfer just
still not what it should be capable of
and then we had the Eureka moment
SMB multi-channel leverages multiple CPU
threads for faster file transfers so I
tried adjusting the number of cores in
my Extreme Edition machine down to two
to see if that would slow things down it
actually didn't but it did help me
observe the very high CPU usage on that
machine so the answer then was actually
the core i3 the equivalent that I had
tried to create on the other side so we
turned the extreme edition back up to
four cores
eight threads to be similar to what an
enthusiast where the core i7 would have
then we swapped out the core i3 in the
Lenovo machine with a 4790k and boom
just like that it worked the proof is in
the pudding SMB multi-channel for under
a hundred dollars can improve your
network transfer speeds and this is
great for editing HD or 4k video files
over an as for improving the ability of
a single file server to serve multiple
clients or even just making impatient
people who hate waiting for access to
network resources happier and the more
CPU threads you have with a core i7
being ideal on both sides of the
transfer the faster it can go I do wish
at this point in the video that I could
explain some of the inconsistencies that
I observed in getting SMB multi channel
to work at all but maybe that's an
investigation for another day for now
that's the hardware you need and that's
the results that you can achieve which
leads us pretty well into our sponsor
honor who has a showing off the 5x
smartphone today and there's a few
things about it that are notable first
of which is the metal body the design
for
which was inspired by the famous
Guggenheim Museum in Spain so the phone
is actually made with four metal
finishing processes making the diamond
polished aircraft aluminum body actually
surprisingly strong they've got a ton of
color options sunset gold dark gray and
daybreak silver as well as a fingerprint
sensor built into the back that actually
works surprisingly quickly and can be
tapped in order to take photos or
selfies you can actually set up
different fingers middle pointer and
pinky as shortcuts to open different
apps like maybe you could use your pinky
to open up your contacts your middle to
you know open up contacts you don't like
and your index to open up Instagram or
whatever else it's powered by android
5.1 lollipop with 16 gigs of internal
memory and 2 gigs of ram as well as a
qualcomm 64-bit octa-core processor in
order to deliver actually a surprisingly
smooth experience given the price point
but we'll get to that after it's got a
five and a half inch 1080p display as
well as a 13 megapixel rear camera and
multiple card slots in order for you to
add additional storage as well as two
SIM cards which leads us again to the
price it comes in at 199 US dollars that
is just the normal everyday price and
you can check that out at the link in
