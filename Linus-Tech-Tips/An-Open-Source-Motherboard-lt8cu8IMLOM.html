2019 and I'm here walking around in this
veritable sea of next-generation
technology like they've got everything
here from cloud computing to AI to
quantum computing both from IBM and its
partners and then I spot this out of the
corner of my eye now this might not look
unusual at all we've got what like a
motherboard and like a workstation or
something but what you're looking at
here contains tech that at this time is
simply not available from the CPU
company is that most consumers would
think of PCI Express Gen 4 right here so
these systems are running CPUs based on
IBM's
power 9 architecture and what's really
cool is that the hardware for them
basically all of it even even this
motherboard is open source what on earth
does that mean let me let me explain
that
so IBM's power architecture is nothing
new in fact if you bought a Mac back in
the early 2000s you've used it before
but over the last 10 to 15 years it's
gotten some big upgrades and the power
nine processors in our demo rig here are
the same ones in everything from
high-performance Network storage
appliances to literal supercomputers but
what makes them open-source well
the CPUs themselves are not although IBM
actually does allow even CPU hardware
technology to be licensed but it's the
ecosystem around them that is that's
where the open power foundation comes in
so now instead of only being able to get
a power 9 solution from IBM directly you
can get one from half a dozen or so
different manufacturers and what we're
looking at here are examples of ones
that are open in every way so this
motherboard I could just assuming that I
had the means I could just download the
schematics and build one myself it's
crazy even down to the firmware so it's
got these two BIOS chips with actually
this really cool solution so you can
actually flip this little dip switch and
write protect them so that they can't
become corrupted or infected in any way
and I could just I could build the whole
thing and it would be ready to rock and
then I could just run standard software
on it like Linux or FreeBSD so this
system right here is running regular old
Linux and other than the fact that it's
power 9 instead of x86 is every bit as
normal alike workstation or tower server
as you could expect so you got a couple
CPU sockets for up to a total of 44
cores you got 16 memory slots they run
quad-channel memory I mean the thing
that's exceptional about it is how sort
of unexceptional it is it just looks
like a normal motherboard you've even
got just like a standard Radeon Pro
workstation graphics card in here x5
sound card of all things and PCI Express
slots I mean their Gen 4 that's cool but
like yeah us USB header
normal friggin thing like could I just
like run video games on this thing
hi prince gaming keyboard and mouse on
here nice I like it
keeping it classy right enterprise show
this is what like a quake arena style oh
my god this mouse is so sensitive is
this a shotgun oh god this is the
railgun again Oh Oh balls
there ya go you're done this is like the
least appropriate possible use of a
system like this I love it
team using development workstation for
gaming that's my team one more one more
oh no I finally I died okay so that's
probably enough of me playing games on
the very serious tool actually let's
talk about why all of this so the
openness of open power has some key
advantages from a performance standpoint
it's allowed faster ecosystem
development so they're already shipping
not just PCI Express Gen 4 which is
about twice as fast as the 3rd gen bus
that everyone else is using right now
but they also have support for open copy
which is twice as fast as PCIe Gen 4 and
the ability to run up to 3 Tesla V 100
GPUs off of a single CPU using env link
which is not only faster again than open
copy but it also allows for full data
coherency between the CPUs and the up to
6 GPUs that you can handle in a dual CPU
system so that means that they don't
have to wait around to share information
between them speeding up computationally
intensive workloads like in particular
AI then there's the security side of
things with specter and meltdown to some
extent but more with some of the recent
concerns about the management engine on
some processors there's a huge part of
the open source community or just the
computing community in general that
wants more openness when it comes to
hardware a high-performance chip that
has no binary blobs on it and you can
build everything from source and that is
exactly what we're looking at here so
power 9 processors are available in a
wide variety of configurations with
anywhere from as few as four to as many
as
to processing course but there are a few
things that they all have in common
quad-channel ddr4 44 PCI Express Gen 4
lanes per CPU and a ton of optimization
for massively parallel workloads so you
might be familiar with technologies that
use SMT to allow a single CPU core to
work on more than one thread at a time
well rather than two threads power 9 can
handle 4 threads per CPU so a fully
loaded 44 core rig like this one can
handle 176 threads now then obviously
most people aren't just running out and
buying one of these and one of these and
DIY a tower for the receptionist in
their office with it or whatever so the
question that this raises then is why
have a low cost board like this or even
relatively speaking a low cost board
like this one well systems like this are
mostly geared towards developers so that
they have an affordable way to test
their code at their desk with that said
though that's not necessarily because it
has to be that way forever with the
right software either of these could be
adapted for more conventional you know
consumer or professional use it's just
that that's not the focus right now so
they're mainly there for the developers
who are writing code for the bigger
systems like IBM's a c920 to this crazy
powerful AI optimized server platform
that's been used in the Lawrence
Livermore and Oak Ridge National Labs
which by the way contain the number two
and number one respectively most
powerful supercomputers in the world
right now here's another one this is
something IBM is calling power AI vision
and this is like a new program without a
ton of adoption yet but there's some
amazing real-world applications so they
did some stuff with frontier development
labs that involved space weather
specifically tracking solar flares
recognizing that a hundred years ago
there was one that fried all of the
basic electronics on earth at the time
and they figure wow if that were to
happen today that would be like a multi
trillion dollar event civil
Asian as we know it threatening so
they're trying to use deep learning and
machine learning to put together
historical and predictive data so that
we could prepare for that pretty freakin
cool and important right I mean I guess
that's kind of the theme overall the
show here and all that's left now is to
thank IBM for sponsoring this and thank
you guys for watching our video from
here down at IBM think 2019 if you guys
dislike this video well you know where
that button is but if you liked it hit
like get subscribed or maybe consider
checking out where to buy the stuff we
featured hopeful totally if you have
very deep pockets like down to your
shins at the link in the video
description and while you're down there
there's our merch store which has pull
shirts like this one and our community
forum which is definitely worth a joint
finance is dead one right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
