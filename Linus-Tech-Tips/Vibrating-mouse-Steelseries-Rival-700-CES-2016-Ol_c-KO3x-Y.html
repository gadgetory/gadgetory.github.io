to CES 2016 this year check out their
link in the video description down below
we are at SteelSeries and this is the
rival 700 it's got a fair amount of cool
things but we're going to start with
more basic ones and warm up to the
exciting thing so first off it has a
pick start 30 360 optical sensor which
you can swap out if you want right now I
think they have a laser option maybe if
you're into that in the future the idea
is if something comes out that you want
you would be able to swap it out and
this one actually is swappable in a very
cool way it's just four screws you drop
the sensor plate out it's a whole plate
assembly thing and then four screws back
in and you're done it's no like weird
sketchy taking the thing apart doing
crazy things like this will actually
probably work which is cool it also has
a swappable backplate if you're into
just changing things all the time so I'm
assuming like if you go to pax you might
be able to get a pax backplate or if you
really like a certain csgo team you
might be able to get layer their logo on
a backplate or something we'll see where
they go with this there's also RGB
lighting so like every mouse that's
coming out right now you can change a
whole bunch of different colors and it
has a three foot rubber cable and a six
foot braided cable and all that kind of
stuff is great but the really
interesting part is game sense so the
game sense for this mouse will work in
csgo and dota 2 it can follow your
health your ammo and your current
headshots and there's going to be more
coming in that regard we're hoping for a
few like Ed's will suggested maybe they
should be able to track your stat track
on your weapons I was suggesting that at
the end of the round they could total
how many headshots you got or something
like that so we'll see where it goes
with that the interesting one though you
can have the lights react to that
there's an OLED screen on the left front
hand side right now we have like Nicolas
Cage's head spinning but you can have
some other stuff there these things
require you looking down at your mouse
so personally I don't actually find them
that interesting maybe you're into that
I don't know not my thing
what is interesting however is the
haptic feedback engine which at first
probably sounds horrible because you're
like why would I want my mouse to shake
all around it's going to screw up with
my aiming I'm not going to want this
thing I'm going throw in the garbage
pick another one up and that'll be fine
but they changed some things it's a very
weak motor which is exactly what you
want you don't want a strong motor in
this situation and it's vibrating
vertically instead of left and right so
it shouldn't actually affect your aim at
all
in the usage of myself and Etzel we
didn't notice it affecting our aim
either which is great like I said it can
react to health ammo or headshots so
right now if you're under 50% HP it
starts a heartbeat vibration if you
headshot someone it vibrates once and
when you get low ammo I think it
vibrates once but you can configure all
of these things you can change the
amounts that it reacts on you can add
different layers per each one so
personally I'm not that interested in it
reacting on my health because I'll
probably know about where I am and I'm
not interested at all and it reacting on
headshots I just want it to tell me
about my ammo account that sounds
amazing
I personally wanted to vibrate once when
I get to like around 50% of my clip and
then maybe when I have like 5 bullets
left or something like that it vibrates
twice or something I don't know that's
what I'm interested in so you can turn
the other ones off and just have it tell
you what you need so do you care that
much about the ammo left in your
magazine I personally want to know if I
only have like two bullets left in my
mag because I don't want to jump into a
firefight with that little I'm not as
good as Eddie probably not gonna
headshot the dude I need more ammo
that's fine I can deal with that
let me know in the comments down below
what you think are you okay with your
mouth shaking honestly I wasn't then I
tried it now I am so I don't know it's
going to be interesting if you need a
website because you made a mouse that
has a swappable sensor and you need to
sell the sensor somehow or you think
that's boring and you have some other
idea for a website I'm really running
out of ideas guys I don't know what to
say from now on you can use Squarespace
they have tons of templates they have a
commerce module if you need to sell
things they have a cover page thing if
you run out of terrible ideas so don't
have a job anymore and you no need to
put a resume online you can use the
cover page module because it's designed
for one very good looking page if you
sign up for a year you get a free domain
they have 24/7 Live Support just in case
you're a new but need help
they also 24/7 email support same idea
it's not that complicated Squarespace
build it beautiful I need to go sleep
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
