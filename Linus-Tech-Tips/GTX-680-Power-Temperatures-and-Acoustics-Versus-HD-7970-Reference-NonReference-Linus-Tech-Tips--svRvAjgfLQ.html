and acoustics oriented segments of my
sort of series of video reviews on the
geforce gtx 680 this one's from galaxy
although this is a reference port and
I'll get into a little bit more the
advantages and disadvantages of a
reference board very very shortly so out
of the cards that you guys see here so
I've got the GTX 680 I've also got a
Radeon HD 7970 which price-wise as well
as market positioning Rises its closest
competitor and what on earth did he just
drop my cats like dropping things all
right moving on closest competitor in
terms of positioning and so we're gonna
see how these two stack up head-to-head
both of these are reference cards and
then there's one card that I haven't
tested yet so is not part of my graphs
but I want to include it less for the
power consumption and the here we go and
the idle temperature purposes and more
for the load temperature and load noise
purpose because I mean the thing about
any launch card is it's always a
reference card which means it's an
Nvidia designed or an AMD designed card
using a reference or AMD or Nvidia
designed cooler with a reference AMD or
Nvidia designed PCB so the advantage is
that of that is that it's all validated
by AMD or Nvidia so that's good usually
these reference coolers tend towards the
blower types of coolers which exhaust
air from the case which some people
consider better whereas others prefer
the more open style of coolers which
deliver significantly better cooling
performance for the GPU itself but do
not necessarily keep the rest of your
system components as cool
reference boards are pretty standard so
you're not going to see a lot of extra
features like for example
on you know high-end skews you sometimes
see non-reference PCBs with more power
phases things like that better coolers
so there's a non reference card so at
launch we are pretty much stuck with
reference boards I'm looking forward to
seeing GeForce GTX 680 s with non
reference designs but for now this is
what we got and what the reason I want
to compare this non reference 7970 is
because we're starting to see non
reference 79 70s now and I want to look
at what kind of an advantage it has in
terms of especially acoustics as well as
low temperatures compared to a reference
card so let's do charts and graphs first
since that's everybody's favorite part
of these videos right so remember not
including the Sapphire dual-x fan 7970
here
let's talk system idle temps to start
with and my cat really needs to get out
of the way one go away go away please
thank you all right here we go system
idle temperatures in degrees Celsius so
here I've got a wide variety of
different cards you can see that out of
all of them the sixty nine ninety
compared to its closest competition in
terms of performance which is the 680
and the 7970 as well as the GTX 590 is
by far the worst idle temperatures but
that's kind of to be expected the 69 90
is a bit of a beast when it comes to
noise as well as power consumption so I
mean honestly so as the 590 not as loud
but definitely in terms of power
consumption and heat output the so the
680 comes in at 33 degrees honestly all
of these are close enough and they're
all quiet enough at idle that none of
it's really concerned now instead of
using fur mark for low temperature
testing which I have traditionally done
in the past I am using games now so i am
recording temperatures during games and
then I'm tracking whatever was the
highest temperature that was reached and
I'm going with that in fact you know
what oh I guess I actually don't have to
I don't have to do the dual act 7970
because we can kind of extrapolate the
results from the dual ex 7950 that I did
use for my testing I sort of forgot
about that
okay well either way I'll use this one
for the acoustic testing since I don't
know
if I have that 7950 on me right now so
reference boards all of these are
reference cards these 7970 OC the 680
the 79 17 on overclock 16 on 95 75 85 90
and GTX 680 non overclocked they all
have her around that 75 to 80 degrees
range although they vary wildly in terms
of noise with the 6990 beam by far the
loudest check out what you get by going
with an aftermarket cooler you can drop
20 to 25 degrees off of your load
temperatures on your card we're talking
real world gaming load by the time you
put it in a closed case you're probably
going to gain another 3 to 5 degrees but
we're still talking a very significant
improvement in performance of the cooler
on your card so that's something to bear
in mind so that was with the 7950 OC
from sapphire which is using their dual
X cooler next we've got system idle
power draw so this is where this latest
generation of cards just obliterates the
previous generation cards check out
these numbers 680 and 7970 consume up to
a hundred are up to 50 or 60 watts less
power than previous generations
similarly performing cards like to 69 90
in the GTX 590 what that means is
basically the equivalent of not having a
light bulb on at all times when you have
your PC on this is like having like just
sort of like a random light bulb on
somewhere in your house at all times
when you PC is idling in terms of the
extra power consumption and then at load
the story gets even more dramatic I mean
check this out guys so the 69 90 and the
GTX 590 are just absolute power hogs
whereas these latest generation cards
consume a trivial amount we mean we're
talking about 3 percent more power than
a last generation 580 for the 680 but in
spite of that the performance of this
card is just world's better and I oh I
just clicked something bad okay it's
back is world's better so the 680 in
many scenarios is outperforming the GTX
here let's take Battlefield 3 for an
example is outperforming the GTX 580 by
a factor of more than double so in terms
of the performance per watt it just just
yeah I've just rocks I mean the 7970 is
no slouch either although it does
consume more power under load versus the
GTX 680 the 7950 consume significantly
less power and hopefully we'll see this
something similar from something like a
GTX 670 or whatever the derivative is
going to be that comes out of it and I'm
very very excited about that system idle
power draw in watts oh yeah we went
through that so that's pretty much it so
now let's just do some acoustic testing
I'll give you guys some idle and then
gaming load reading so my testing
methodology as unscientific as this may
be basically involves taking my camera
holding it a fixed distance away from
the cards and then letting you guys
listen to it for a period of about five
seconds
honestly it's too bad that this
particular 7970 has a significant amount
of coil line it's based on a reference
PCB while it does have a reference
cooler so you can't really tell how
quiet the cooler is I did not have the
same issue with the 7950 dual-x
that one was very very quiet because it
was using a sapphire designed PCB as
opposed to a reference one anyway don't
