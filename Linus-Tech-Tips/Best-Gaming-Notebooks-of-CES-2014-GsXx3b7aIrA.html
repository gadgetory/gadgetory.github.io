brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital welcome to our best
gaming notebooks of CES 2014 adventure
we're kicking things off here at the
Intel booth where I've been given a
challenge or a quest or whatever you
might want to call it either way I hope
you guys will join us for the adventure
to find my personal favorite gaming
notebooks here at the show now there's
no particular criteria it doesn't have
to be the best performance it doesn't
have to be the thinnest or the lightest
or got a particular color it's just the
ones that really stood out to us as we
journeyed Las Vegas going into all the
Suites and all over the show floor
trying to find our favorite gaming
notebooks well this was unexpected it
looks like we're gonna be one of the
only ones able to bring you this news oh
wait no this this is one of MSI's
workstation notebooks this is gaming
systems best gaming systems of CES ah
yes this guy right here I can't tell you
guys the model I actually covered it as
well in the video of Emma sighs sweet so
you can go check that out for a few more
details but the core i7 quad core
processor in here is paired with an
undisclosed graphic solution in
completely unreal enclosure it is
phenomenally slim it feels faster than
the GS 70 in real world gaming and
unlike the GS 70 about which I had one
complaint and that was that it was dense
it was heavy I mean the thing was made
of metal so what were we gonna expect
this one feels more like it's made of
plastic but I know for a fact just from
touching it and looking at it it is
definitely made of metal unfortunately I
can't tell you guys too much about this
not even its name but it is definitely
one of our highlights of the show gaming
notebooks just don't look like what they
used to look like anymore this is the
Auris x7 it is an extremely slim gaming
notebook and you might go okay well I've
heard a lot of things called extremely
slim gaming notebooks and usually
they're just not that powerful but this
one is it has a core i7 quad core and it
also
has GeForce GTX 765 M graphics not one
but two of them it has two graphics
cards running in SLI - which you might
reply okay - well it probably runs
really hot then the answer is no
actually it does not the keyboard does
not get more than slightly warm to the
touch you're not going to get sweaty
hands syndrome or as I call it sh s from
using this particular notebook and if
you are curious about what the power of
dual GTX 765 M s is like they've got a
couple of demos running here one is
batman arkham origins running at about
normal settings and you can see that
we're looking at about 60 FPS average so
since we have vsync on that actually
only tells us that we are able to run
the game butter smooth at 60 FPS with
only mild dips to 44 frames per second
they also have it running a 4k gaming
demo over in the other corner so whether
you are gaming on the display that's
built in which is a 1080p display not a
TN panel just like thumbs up or whether
you want to plug in up to three external
displays or one high resolution one you
will be pretty much good to go
continuing our quest for the hottest
gaming notebooks here at CES we're in
the a su suite where we're checking out
the G 750 Jay Z it features an upcoming
nvidia geforce presumably GTX high-end
graphics card of some sort we can't even
tell you what it is that's how new and
exciting it is as an Intel Core i7 quad
core processor
it features Thunderbolt technology as
well as 4 USB 3 ports but more
importantly than any of that is what's
here in the back massive massive heat
sinks with dual fans for ventilation so
no matter what you are throwing at this
a sexy but a little bit heavy which
should give you some kind of clue as to
what kind of powerful hardware is inside
no matter what you throw at this sexy
gaming beast it will stay cool and look
good doing it now we're at the Nvidia
booth we found another awesome gaming
notebook here at CES 2014 this is the
razor blade 14 it's actually one that
we've looked at before but that doesn't
really make it any less exceptional you
can see we're running Assassin's Creed 4
here this particular notebook has a 14
inch display it's got a gorgeous green
LED backlit display it has did I say
display because I meant keyboard don't
worry about it you guys I
got this I got this I'm pretty tired
we're on like day three of the show here
it's an extremely slim form factor and
the most exceptional thing about it has
got to be the build quality in spite of
the core i7 quad core processor in GTX
765 M graphics card in here it's got
this super super slim beautiful aluminum
design that is as portable as it is
deadly so just because we've seen it
before and just because it's not the
newest thing ever doesn't make it any
less exceptional now I think it's
somewhat safe to say that if you're a
gamer particularly one who's been
shopping for a notebook in the last
little while and you've been on the
internet then you've probably heard of
the y500 series from Lenovo well this my
friends is the y500 series evolved and
pretty much every possible way that I
can think of this is the y50 this is a
sort of an example unit it's going to be
available in a variety of configurations
all Lenovo's really said so far is that
between this one and the 14 inch model
it's gonna be sort of starting at $9.99
but this is one very very impressive
notebook guys the first thing you might
be thinking is well okay Linus you're
saying the Y 50 is better than the Y 500
that doesn't actually make much sense no
no it does because it's not about some
kind of reduction in the hardware spec
it's about a reduction in the overall
size this is one sleek slim beautiful
gaming notebook it's actually it doesn't
really look like a high-performance
gaming notebook and well unfortunately
we can't tell you exactly what graphics
card is in this particular one suffice
it to say there will be some options
coming in the future and there will be
some more information and that will give
you some some green you know perspective
on how impressive the feat is later on
down the line it also contains a quad
core Intel Core i7 processor it's got a
red backlit keyboard it's got a
beautiful soft touch finish here on the
on the surface of the notebook but I
kind of saved the best for last here a
little bit guys this display right here
in addition to having great viewing
angles vibrant colors without looking
oversaturated to be perfectly honest is
a 4k display now unfortunately they
don't all ship with 4k displays that now
or anything like that but the fact that
it's even available as an option is
unreal and to go along with you know
just to sit again to demonstrate that
it's got the power to back it up we are
running two 4k videos this one's on the
upcoming Dell 24 inch 4k monitor this
one's on the notebook itself and they're
both running off the notebook right now
the end of our quest is actually in the
Intel booth but it didn't really have to
be it's just that this particular demo
with the Alienware 18 is particularly
impressive because it's one thing to
have the Alienware 18 with its quad core
Core i7 processor in dual GTX 780 m/s
running games on its own display it is
quite another to fire up a 60 Hertz 4k
display from Panasonic and be running
Batman Arkham origins in silky smooth
gorgeous detail so you guys can probably
actually see that in spite of Batman
being dropping around and swinging
around places it is running at an
incredibly smooth playable framerate
considering the fact that this is still
a portable machine while it might not
have the same you know slim form factor
as some of the other ones we're looking
at if it's raw horsepower you're after
well those options are still available
as well thanks so much for checking out
our favorite gaming notebooks of CES

it dislike it if you disliked it leave a
comment and let me know which one was
your favorite gaming notebook and more
importantly why and then last but not
least as always guys don't forget to
