doing this the WD TV live is a network
media player and the WD livewire is a
way to more easily network your house
now if you want to know what this is
I'll say in a nutshell this is powerline
Ethernet if you already know what
powerline Ethernet is you probably don't
need to keep watching unless you really
want to know the specifics of the WD
livewire so if you don't know what power
line is Ethernet is then stay tuned and
I'm going to explain the whole thing so
first of all this is a powerline AV
network kit so that means you've got up
to 200 megabits per second data transfer
speeds so you can stream HD you can
connect up to 8 devices so two adapters
by four ports very cool on the side we
see some more information
aha so they're comparing powerline vs
Wi-Fi it is faster and more reliable
yeah I'm with them on that one is immune
to interference it is easy to install
and they are both protected by
encryption so you've got two adapters
with a total of four ports so that means
you can connect up to seven devices and
your router all protected with 128-bit
encryption create high-speed Internet
connection anywhere in your home without
running wires between rooms yes that is
the beauty of powerline so what you do
with a powerline adapter and I'm
actually a maybe I'll even do like a
practical demonstration of this okay
we've got an installation CD which I
can't imagine there'd be any use for
then we have a technical support limited
warranty guide we have the movie
livewire a QuickStart guide so step one
plug in step two you win aha the CD is
just a user manual yeah that's what I
figured
okay so we've got a couple of Gigabit
Ethernet cables we have one live wire
alright then we go for ports on there
and as well as a sync button which I've
never actually had to use with any
modern power line kit there's an on/off
switch in case you want to turn off your
network and there is an important little
bit of instructions you never plug a
powerline kit into a power bar it can
cause interference you want to
get directly into the wall although I
have seen them work green power bars
before I mean for the best results
though you always want to talk them
directly into the wall and power line
does have some other limitations as well
you need to be some houses have sort of
half of the circuits or on one half and
half of the circuits are on the other
half and they can't communicate between
each other but even if you've got to
power like two wall plugs that are on
separate circuits as long as they're
sort of within that same grouping
they'll be able to communicate with each
other so I don't know what WD is done to
overcome that some of the biggest
problems with powerline tend to be
incompatibility with network adapters or
any compatibility with routers but with
a product from WD I would be surprised
to see any of those issues and I will
test it out a little bit hopefully over
the net well my battery died just in
time for me to suggest testing it so
off-camera I've gone and hooked up the
live wire so I've got it running you can
see there's the four Ethernet ports on
the back of the unit so I just plugged
into any random one and then I have a
wire running to a wall outlet here in my
computer room and going into my gigabit
switch okay if we're gonna test its
capabilities by going all the way
downstairs okay hi rocket Captree so
we're way down to the living room where
we will find a TV which is connected to
a media PC which is connected to a WT
live wire okay and oh I actually made a
mistake and I plugged it in through a
power bar but in my testing it worked
anyway so we're gonna fire up Big Buck
Bunny which is a 1080p video clip a free
one
and we're going to demonstrate that it
plays 1080p video just nicely
you don't really have to watch the rest
of this video because it's just gonna be
Big Buck Bunny yeah maybe we can skip
around to somewhere where there's
slightly faster action so the bitrate
might be a little bit higher
anyway flawless playback on 1080 piece
because it is a 200 megabit per second
connection
unlike most power line kits these days
which are about a hundred megabit per
second the 200 megabit per second ones
are quite a bit more extensive in most
cases but you can see that it does give
you the capability to run full HD video
over powerline and I'd imagine we would
even get slightly better performance if
we were using the livewire directly
plugged into the wall you can see
skipping around in the video isn't
giving us too much success here but
that's okay all right why don't we
actually go do a file transfer now so
why don't we take that file and just
copy it right to the desktop here
yeah I guess that's about in line with
my expectations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
