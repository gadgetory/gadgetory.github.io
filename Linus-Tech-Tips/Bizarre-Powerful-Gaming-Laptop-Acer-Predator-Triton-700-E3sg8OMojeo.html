chump in 2017 have a thick ass laptop
trust me you will not be picking up any
of the Milady's if you're packing
anything over an inch and remember boys
it's not just the size of the laptop
that counts but what you're able to do
with it
well Acer seems to think they've solved
both of these problems by packing what
they say is the fastest GTX 10 80 max Q
GPU into this sleek 18 point nine
millimeter frame and speaking of frames
today's video is brought to you by
shade-tree sunglasses they're hand made
from hardwood materials featuring
polarized lenses and they come with soft
and hard carry cases use offer code
Linus to get five bucks off through the
link below
so with its cool gray aluminum back
panel and somehow less tacky than usual
must be the blue accent predator logo
there is no denying the Triton 700 is a
different breed of gaming laptop this is
one fine-looking machine opening it up
the thick bezels and the plastic around
the webcam are not ideal but these can
be forgiving once you see that sexy
glass window that subtly shows off the
cooling fan and the heat pipes below and
look it is not just about that bling
bling I mean you got a respect design
that performs while also managing to
turn sexy engineering into a showpiece
and the fact that they also managed to
integrate the multi-touch trackpad into
it is straight-up cool even if it's not
ideal for usability more on that later
moving down from the tempered glass we
get to the oddly placed keyboard
embedded in a very sturdy aluminum
chassis the keyboard is fully
programmable and boasts full RGB
backlighting although in my opinion it
does look best when it's left blue to
match the lights on the side and the
logo on the back we can take a look at
the i/o now Thunderbolt 3 with 4 PCIe
lanes lots of USB
full-size DisplayPort and Ethernet very
nice okay now let's just boot it up and
oh wow okay really that's not controlled
by system volume well make sure you
disable that in the BIOS or you're gonna
be that guy on the other hand maybe you
want your friends colleagues and
neighbor down the street to know just
how powerful your notebook is because
with internals like these this thin and
light monster should make short work of
all but the thickest of rivals with that
said specs are nothing without cooling
thankfully the Triton 700 has some
legitimately impressive cooling chops
and for the most part it succeeds at
keeping both the CPU and GPU from
thermal throttling our GPU hit a
shocking 71 degrees max at room
temperature and only a combined
synthetic load managed to overload the
CPUs cooler and that is a pretty
unrealistic workload and this is all
while staying calm and for a gaming
machine relatively quiet like I got it
running right now mics right there
ace are even overclocked the GPU a bit
to make bears the fastest mac ski laptop
available consistently beating out the
Asus Sepphoris though admittedly this is
a bit of a hollow victory since
overclocking what is essentially an
under clocked chip is kind of like
sandbagging your fitness tracker for the
rest of the week so that you can do 200
percent of your daily goal on Friday a
real desktop GTX 1080 or for that matter
even a thicker laptop with an on max Q
1080 puts both of these pretenders to
the throne in their place pretty handily
but your desktop wouldn't have an
integrated 120 Hertz 1080p IPS display
with g-sync
now would it the display is a bright
point for this product literally like
it's bright and with good viewing angles
and satisfactory motion blur it's great
to look at while you game and if someone
wants to look at you the webcam is
pretty solid too now the speaker's
didn't blow me away but they're not bad
at all especially considering how thin
it is if you don't mind the lackluster
bass and having a Dolby Atmos
certification is great if you're a
headphone user but let's get back to the
interface the trackpad looks really cool
and you could make the argument that
gamers would be pretty likely to take
advantage of the recessed USB port to
carry around a high performance wireless
mouse but if you care about size enough
to pay a premium for this versus a less
total gaming notebook then you probably
are planning to try to use it as a
portable device from time to time
and while economically this placement
actually didn't bother me nearly as much
as I expected it's a lot better than the
weird-shaped ones on the right of the
keyboard in my opinion you do need to be
careful not to mash keys on your
keyboard with your palm and there are
definitely some other issues the
boundaries are poorly marked with no
tactile bump to indicate that you've
crossed them the glossy gorilla glass is
a greasy fingerprint magnet the lack of
physical buttons for a two-handed
operation is a huge downer for me
personally and those are real heat pipes
down there
it gets hot reaching as high as 53
degrees under load although this should
only be an issue if you were to use the
trackpad immediately after a gaming
session on the subject of planning to
use it as a regular notebook the custom
mechanical keyboard is awesome with a
nice short but satisfyingly clicky key
travel that makes it a great balance for
both gaming and typing Alex wanted to
read it damn near perfect and saying
that if they threw in a wrist rest it
could be a 10 out of 10 while I did find
it a touch on the stiff side though with
that said the power brick is really big
and battery life still gets killed by
basically every other laptop remember
guys GT X 1080 laptops don't use onboard
graphics and optimist technology to save
power at idle for the tinkerers out
there popping the Triton 700 open and
unscrewing this heat shield reveals the
five heat pipes responsible for the
impressive performance results we saw as
well as two M two slots and two ddr4
sodium slots now they're already
populated on our config so you won't be
upgrading much unless you want to throw
away what's already in there to beef up
your RAM or storage down the road but I
still appreciate that they aren't
soldered that's something you can't take
for granted with all Finan lights
leading us to a conclusion time I guess
you know what overall I really like the
predator Titan 700 it's pretty easy to
recommend great performance
okay battery life considering all the
other factors and there's only one thing
that
really goes against it the price at
$3,000 it's not a budget option and it's
$400 more than even the competing Asus
zephyrus but with that said you're
already paying a huge premium over just
buying an equivalent desk top plus a
separate than in light for travel so
between the two of them in my mind
the Triton 700 is the way to go thanks
to the better battery life and in my
opinion better trackpad placement the
first content to appear on a new
platform rarely takes full advantage of
the new paradigm for example the first
TV shows were basically radio shows with
the camera turned on and today we're in
a similar place with VR but already
innovative filmmakers are pushing the
artform forward and Intel is pushing
both the technology and the community
forward by partnering with rising
filmmaker Eliza McNish to take audiences
behind the scenes of her upcoming VR
film pale blue dot you'll actually be
able to control your own adventure as
you peek behind the curtain learning
about how visual effects sound design
and creative Direction converge into a
brand new type of experience the first
version of the internet gave everyone a
voice letting people around the world
including young lioness create whatever
content they wanted and the next wave is
for the audience to consume content any
way they want and that is what VR is
about so check out the latest episode of
on the making of the pale blue dot and
