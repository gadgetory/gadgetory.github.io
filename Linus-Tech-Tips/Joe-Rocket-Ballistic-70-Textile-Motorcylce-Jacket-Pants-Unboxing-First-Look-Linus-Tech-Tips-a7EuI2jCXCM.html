unboxing that I have done in quite a
while I have been eagerly awaiting this
shipment from new enough so that is a
motorcycle gear supply store and as some
of you know I did recently purchase a
motorcycle I just completed my training
course and this is my set of textile
gear that I have ordered in order to
make sure that I am well protected okay
so this is a Joe rocket ballistic 7.0
jacket it features Cee approved armor in
the shoulders and the elbows so
hopefully I'll be able to show that to
you all right it is in theory a
waterproof jacket although the outer
layer is just a simple textile material
there is actually a waterproof I believe
it's a mid liner yeah a waterproof no
that's a waterproof inner liner or
something like that no hold on I looked
at so many different jackets no no this
has a waterproof outer layer it all it
also features air vents for if you get
warm ok you can see the zippers are
waterproofed so you can open up the air
vents here in the arms you can open up I
believe there are other air vents here
in the chest open those up get some
airflow see there's an internal
waterproof zipper underneath that as
well I'm gonna try and get you guys a
better angle on that just like that and
then I believe there are also air vents
in the back so that is the exhaust vent
back here so you undo these clips there
we go my helmet was supposed to arrive
today by Canada Post screwed up so I
will not actually be able to ride my
bike this weekend which is very very
unfortunate ok so here I'm just gonna
start trying these on the ideas that I
should be able to put my riding gear on
over top of my work clothes
and then I will be able to ride to work
and then home from work on my motorcycle
okay and then I also got matching
ballistic 7.0 pants so new enough is
pretty good because it's cheap the
jacket was on closeout so even though I
wouldn't normally buy a brand name like
doh rocket because it's really expensive
the price was right and then the
matching pants were also a fairly good
deal you know what there's probably some
marketing bullet points on all of this
convenient stuff right here on the
jacket itself so airguard
super tenacious fabric that's good okay
excellent lightness durability freshness
oh you know what's something I should
talk about in terms of the fabric is the
reason I went with a textile jacket is
because it does offer some abrasion
resistance you do have the armor
included with it as well although it
does not offer the same abrasion
resistance as leather at street speeds
though a textile jacket is going to
protect you well enough but it will
probably be ruined whereas a leather
jacket will protect you and you can
probably still wear it it'll just have
scuff marks on it a textile jacket is
probably going to tear in that kind of a
situation so protector oh yeah this is
the seee armor so this does use a soft
armor inside this jacket there are hard
armors as well all right here's a
cross-section of the air guard hollow
yarn cool high-technology
fabric they're not opposed here's some
other Joe Rocket stuff they do leathers
as well but I mean I'm gonna be riding
in the rain in theory so the last thing
I wanted was to live to get leathers
okay the pants I believe the pants
actually zip up to the jacket you see
there's a zipper right here it includes
the other half in case you have a
different jacket but since these ones
they're matching they zip together right
off the bat
these ones I bought a little bit large
because I do want them to go on overtop
of my jeans and they actually have if
they're anything like the ones that I
tried on in a local store yep
they have zippers down here so you can
actually put your riding boots on here
we go
goes way up the leg so you can put your
riding boots on then put the pants on
here's the waterproof internal liner and
there is the the mesh as well as you can
see the soft ze knee pad armor right
there including a little shin shin pad
piece so let's go ahead make sure these
fit because I actually didn't try the
ballistic 7.0 pants before I ordered
them I tried a different series of
ballistic pants let's see how this goes
and then I'll be all geared up for
riding except for my helmet which isn't
here yet so I will not be riding this
weekend but I'll be thinking about it
yep that's the best I can do so actually
give me give me a minute to get into the
clothes here and then cameraman can
either
you can not keep filming and something
am I supposed I know this is a little
bit off topic as far as tech tips go but
I don't know people seem to not really
mind when I uploaded through my personal
stuff so camera man's around behind you
getting footage of me trying on these
pits oh there we go
okay no I did have to get the ones with
a short inseam so I got a medium size
way short in theme pack Joe Rocket was
one of the few brands that I was able to
find that did offer short in seams
without buying ladies pants which
there's nothing really wrong with either
because they're all cut the same there's
only a few ladies garments for
motorcycle gear that are actually cut
differently and they're mostly jackets
one thing that's cool though is that
most of the ladies pants have adjustable
adjustable pants so you can actually
fold them up and then they're like self
hemming kind of thing so let's go ahead
and put these on
Wow these folding zippers are a pain I
think I'll go ahead and put my boots on
after I get into the pants as a general
rule and wow this is hot so I can tell
already on a day like today I would
probably need to have the vents open in
order to be appreciating the armor and
gear and such so when you're fitting
yourself for motorcycle gear one of the
things that's really important is making
sure that it doesn't fit loose it
shouldn't fit like street clothes so you
can see my movement is actually quite
restricted in this garment because the
idea is I'm supposed to be down like
this and that's the only position on
ever in it's not about how comfortable
it is it's about making sure that the
armor doesn't shift if you move around
the fabric like this so you can see that
elbow pad is gonna stay right where I
need it even if I'm tumbling around in a
crash that's the whole idea so there we
have it that is my new motorcycle gear
and I wish I had a helmet I will update
you guys if the helmet does arrive in
time for Friday thanks for checking out
my video don't forget to subscribe to
Linus tech tips
camerman was convincing the pants don't
appear to appear to fit me quite right
and what I was just explaining to him is
that when you're up on the pegs all of
it and you're wearing your motorcycle
boots all of a sudden that little bit of
extra length is gonna go away pretty
fast so these were bought just a touch
long just to make sure that when I'm
actually riding I'll still be covered
from the wind so there you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
