way to find out for sure a thermal
camera meet the one from FLIR and
affordable thermal camera module that
clips to the bottom of your smartphone
math drop is currently featuring the msi
gtx 1080 armor 8g OC learn more at the
link in the video description let's
start with one of my biggest complaints
about the FLIR one in spite of the name
there are actually two of them I mean I
understand the reason one is for Apple
devices with a lightning connector and
the other is for Android devices with a
microbial USB connector but if there was
a way to equip the FLIR 2 or whatever a
successor ended up being called with
swappable interfaces without
compromising the admittedly very strong
connectors i think that would go a long
way towards improving the versatility
and future-proof nosov these devices an
important consideration when you factor
in that even an affordable mobile
accessory version of flares technology
is going to run you 250 US dollars let's
take a closer look then at the one both
versions look almost the same and share
the same internals and same basic mode
of operation so we'll be mostly treating
them as one for the rest of the video
here the outer shell is plastic but a
fairly confidence-inspiring
it's not rated for water or dust
resistance but it seems like it could
survive a drop or two on the right is a
status LED equipped power button so you
can tell when it's booting up versus
fully powered on and ready to engage
with the phone app on the left is a
battery charge indicator and a micro USB
charging port so yes that means the FLIR
one uses a 350 million power internal
battery and does not charge off of the
device it's attached to convenient in
some ways but kind of a drag and others
and finally at the front are the twin
cameras the stars of the show
I did say twin but I should probably
clarify that I mean fraternal twins in
this case because they are absolutely
nothing alike one of them is for
capturing infrared light a thermal
camera and the other is for capturing
visible light a web camera camera the
thermal camera uses flares lepton an
astonishingly small and low-cost long
wave infrared sensor to generate 80
my 60 pixel thermal images that are
accurate to within point 1 degrees
Celsius from a range of -20 all the way
up to 120 degrees that's minus 4 to 248
Fahrenheit for our American viewers the
visible camera is less impressive
it's a 640 by 480 ya vga affair and
that's pretty much all we know about it
other than the reason that the FLIR one
even has one without getting too deep
into this resolution is a word that gets
frequently misused it means how much
detail can be resolved from an image so
a film picture also has a resolution
even if you can't count the pixels so
let's fire up the app and just take a
picture here so the visible camera is
actually where it seems like the
advertised effective resolution of 160
by 120 comes from thanks to a technique
called NSX blending that in a nutshell
captures a visible light picture then
strips out everything but textures and
edges and overlays the thermal image
with the ability to peek behind it at
the original normal capture as needed
for easy diagnosis of whatever it is
that you're looking at an HVAC system a
problematic circuit or that freaking cat
that's trying to avoid being taken to
the vet FLIR claims this technique
allows the image to have five times the
detail a figure that they may have
pulled out of their butts for all I can
tell but whether it's four or five or
six times it clearly works pretty darn
well because the thermal image alone is
much more difficult to read especially
for a lay person like me and on top of
still image capture it actually supports
video panorama and even time-lapse
capture which is actually a stroke of
genius for diagnosing problems that
might develop slowly or be related to
the time of day which is cool Linus but
why should I care what are these things
even for and why the hell do
you need one well for the first one I
don't know about you but I care because
they're just pretty freakin cool as for
practical uses there are actually many
thermal imagers like so many things were
actually developed for military use
allowing personnel to detect heat
signatures engine exhaust operating
machinery and even people during the
Korean War but today their applications
range from medical use ever seen those
cameras and arrivals at the
International Airport they're checking
to see if you have a fever and you're
going to spread disease to building
optimization to check the effectiveness
of insulation to law enforcement night
vision goggles anyone - storm tracking -
home inspection to nature watching you
name it and what we've been enjoying is
the way that suddenly a thermal camera
allows us to validate manufacturer
claims like one pluses assertion that
they're quick charging technique keeps
the phone running cooler than competing
Qualcomm quick charge 3.0 and razors
claim that the new blade 14 2016 Edition
runs much cooler than last year's model
neat right
yeah I guess Linus but uh does this make
the existence of higher-end ones like
the FLIR East 60 which is like a $7,000
camera that you were showing off on
Instagram a little while ago superfluous
great question but no I don't think so
the app is surprisingly stable and
functional but higher-end models have
features that are a must for industrial
use swappable batteries SD recording
rugged housing and the ability to
operate without a phone attached to name
a few and the FLIR one is not perfect we
ran into compatibility issues for
example with the iPhone se and on the
Android side of things the onward march
towards USB type-c standardization
reveals the problem with that
future-proof decision to before we
actually tried using a type c2 micro-b
adapter with the HTC 10 but we didn't
have any luck getting it to work though
your mileage may vary bottom line though
it's not perfect and hopefully
resolution durability and compatibility
rise as cost continues to lower
but if you need an affordable thermal
camera for some reason then the FLIR one
which FLIR is leaving with us to enrich
our future reviews by the way which is
awesome will likely be as welcome in
addition to your diagnostic arsenal as
it is to ours speaking of being a
welcome addition to your arsenal Tuggle
bear and my notes say something about
summer and boarding planes and cars and
trains doesn't want board a car anyway
the point is that tunnel bear is the
simple VPN app that makes it easy to
browse privately and enjoy a more open
Internet with tunnel bear turned on a
couple of things happen number one is
your connection is secured with AES
256-bit encryption and two your online
activity is kept private from your
internet provider and advertisers who
are looking to harvest your data and
sell you more like I don't know aluminum
spoons or whatever some stupid thing
that you've probably seen a banner for
recently tunnel bear has a top rated
privacy policy and does not log your
activity and the best part is you can
try it for absolutely free it's like
those food samples in the grocery store
it's like wow I can have 500 megabytes
of these food samples no credit card
required then if you decide you want an
unlimited plan they start at just a few
bucks a month and you can save 10% by
going to tunnel bear comm /l tt linked

watching guys if this video sucked you
know what to do but if it was awesome
get subscribed hit that like button or
