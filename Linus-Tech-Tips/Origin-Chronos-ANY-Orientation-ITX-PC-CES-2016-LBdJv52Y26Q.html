orientation it wants to be in a good way
we've got crazy rainbow strobing LEDs of
happiness and we have internal paint
colors stay tuned to figure out what the
hell all that means thanks to
Squarespace for sending us to CES 2016
this year check out their link in the
video description down below first up is
the Chronos this is an exclusive chassis
designed by Origen only for them so you
can buy the Chronos to get this case it
is 11.75 inches tall four inches wide
and thirteen point seven five inches of
depth its CPU and GPU support are like
i7 59 60 X so basically whatever the
hell you want and a Titan Zed so really
big graphics cards it is MDOT to support
based on the motherboard for SSD or two
and a half inch slots and one three and
a half inch slot so tons of storage
options and the main cool thing and the
thing that I referenced in the beginning
of the video the orientation it can be
put in pretty much any even semi logical
way you could want it just don't put it
on the i/o or on the faceplate because
that makes literally no sense at all you
could put it down on the window if you
wanted the LEDs to kind of go away for a
little while you could put it on the
right side panel to shoot the LEDs up
and be able to look down straight into
your case you can put it standing up in
a more standard position with the
graphics card at the bottom or you could
flip it around the other way and the
origin logo on the front can be turned
likewise so that you don't have
something going the wrong way looking
weird and messing with your OCD next up
we have the Sentinel software and their
new LED strip so the Sentinel software
lets you check out your system health
check your like support line information
so if you need to email them or call
them or whatever control your fans and
most importantly in terms of what is
going on beside me control your lighting
so the new LED strips are pretty tricked
out they're more customizable than they
were before as you can see we have some
like kind of strobing not really
strobing but changing rainbow effect
going on with individual LEDs shining at
different colors which is pretty sick
and these LED strips on the same strip
also have UV lights so you can decide
whatever one you want that's actually a
really cool combo that I haven't seen
before
and finally the internal paint the
millennium and genesis systems are now
able to be colorized on the inside too
not just the outside so you can see this
really clean looking white system beside
me
and earlier when we were checking out
the LEDs the Genesis system had red
painted on the inside a pretty cool
feature that you configure through their
store whatever let me know what you guys
think in the comments down below about
all this stuff
I like customizability I like new
features I think it's super cool that
they have UV LEDs going along the same
strip anyways let me know thanks to
Squarespace for sending us here to CES
2016 if you wanna make a website selling
crazy LED strips that you probably don't
have because their origins you can have
a Squarespace website the commerce
section would allow you to sell the
things that you don't have you could
make a resume when people realize that
you're lying about things that you don't
have using their cover page application
there's other templates you could have
that would make it look really cool and
if you have trouble setting all that up
because you're a noob you could use
their 24/7 live chat or email support to
help you out as well if you by
Squarespace site for a year you get a
free domain packaged in which is pretty
cool
Squarespace build it beautiful hey you
guys for watching stay subscribed - tech
tips to see all of our CES 2016 content
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
