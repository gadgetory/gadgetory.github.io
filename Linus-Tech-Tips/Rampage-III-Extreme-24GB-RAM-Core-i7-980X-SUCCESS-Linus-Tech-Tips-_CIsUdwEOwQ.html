running now but I wish I had sort of a
more conclusive I wish I had something
more conclusive as to what exactly was
causing the problem because there okay
there's a couple things I ran into first
of all I couldn't get it to post until I
removed the 90 DX that was in there I
put in this kingston ram although i
haven't tried any other ram yet and i
removed my gtx 260 extra 8800 GT s 640
video card which now I've tried on
another system and it seems to be dead
which is very confusing because it was
working up until exactly when I tried to
use it with this system so that's part
of why I ran into trouble it saw really
bad when your tester parts your your
known good components died so anyway I
tried with this GTX 275 that's sitting
here and it worked and then I tried with
with an evaluation Radeon 5000 series
card and it's working with that as well
so we're finally posted into the BIOS
but since the whole point of my original
video with the rampage 3 extreme was
going to be seeing how it reacts with 24
gigs of ram I thought before I go any
further what I'll do is I'll pull out
this Kingston module and then I will see
what happens now that we've actually got
the board posting because we've got a
working video card in it I'm going to go
ahead and install my six RAM dims ok we
got one this is going to take a little
while so please bear with me just got
the camera sort of hanging from my neck
here I've had some complaints that it
causes dizziness and nausea so I guess I
can I'll have to disclaim my show from
now on that watching it may cause you
know vomiting and all those other nasty
pharmaceutical side effects it's ok you
guys can handle it alright there we go
so I got my 6 dims in there it looks all
shiny and gold ok the colour scheme
doesn't really match but that's ok if
you're buying this motherboard you
should probably be buying like some
Reapers or or platinum series Ram anyway
rather than the basic gold so here the
little post LEDs this is what actually
helped me figure out it was the VGA card
so you can see it goes CPU RAM VGA boot
device boom
we are booted up and let's see what it
defects the text by default for the RAM
settings here so target DRAM frequency
1333 so it got there by default let me
see okay extreme Tweaker is the first
option in this board go figure they
assume someone buying a rampage three
extreme board is going to want to tweak
it a little bit Wow
okay so Otto is 1333 we can set it up to
1600 although I have no idea what would
happen if we did that it looks like the
default voltage for the RAM is going to
be 1.5 volts and you know what since
we're you know here anyway
why don't we boot up the system and see
if it's actually even remotely stable
with 1.5 volts because this ocz Ram is
actually rated for 1.6 5 volts at ddr3
1333 CL 9 9 9 21 min is maybe we could
even overclock these modules a little
bit and and and still run them within
their default voltage so that would be
kind of cool so I'm just going to wait
for the system to boot up here let me
see if there's anything else interesting
on my desk Oh check this out it's some
magny-cours but it's not a real one it's
actually just just a blank just to
demonstrate how large the CPU is let me
see if I have anything else around here
to show for for context I guess I don't
really but yeah it's really big now I'll
kind of put it there
so now you can see how big it is
compared to a memory module of every
booted up there we go now I can stop
killing time so here we go why don't we
grab prime95 you always want to use
blend when you're testing RAM because
otherwise it doesn't really test the RAM
and let's have a look at our task
manager here where it will show our
physical memory total of well that
doesn't seem right let's fire up CPU
Zed's here and see what's going on now
hold on available free it's only showing
16 gigs of RAM is that a Windows
limitation ok first let's check here so
in CPU said it shows to 24 gigabytes of
memory and it shows that it is running
at the correct timings except this
should probably be 20 but that has
almost zero impact on performance anyway
the TRS so I wouldn't worry too much
about that and then ok our CPU frequency
is correct everything looks hunky-dory
except for the fact that the RAM here is
only detecting a 16 gig so you know what
it may actually be a BIOS setting this
is not something I've done before
running 20 gigs of ram so here our 24
gigs of ram rather so here let's see
Windows 7 memory limits search is always
your friend when you're troubleshooting
something Windows 7 memory limits here
we go so let's find out what Windows 7
Ultimate is limited to Windows Vista
Windows Vista Windows 7 Windows 7
Ultimate ok should in theory be limited
to a hundred and ninety-two gigs of RAM
but is it possible that there's
something else at play here you know I
had really hoped that this video would
be more conclusive than all of this but
when we go back into the BIOS and see if
there's any kind of setting that might
obviously allow us to see all 24 gigs of
RAM because you can see it is detected
in CPU said it's just a matter of the OS
not being able to utilize it
you see that all the time with your
running like a 32-bit operating system
you'll see four gigs with in-memory
detection programs but you won't
actually see four gigs of addressable
memory space through Windows so okay
here we go okay that's just frequency
memory configuration protect allows you
to lock or unlock the memory
configuration well why don't we okay we
just kind of leave that the way it is in
here I don't see anything that looks
like it pertains to hmm some kind of
memory limit okay
voltages are all good let's see if
there's anything in advance under maybe
chipset or CPU which is where you more
often find extra memory settings these
days because the memory controllers are
on the CPUs on both Intel and AMD
platforms hmm all right well it looks
like I am foiled yet again so once again
please feel free to leave a comment and
let me know if you can think of a way
for me to get access to all 24 gigs of
memory and I just wanted to address a
couple of the ideas that other people
had when I was trying to troubleshoot
posting this board no I did not turn off
the PCI Express slot although that would
have been hilarious and sounds like
exactly the kind of thing I would do the
problem did not end up being that I had
to have a molex plug here in here and I
even tried with a higher power graphics
card that 275 co-op and that did not fix
the problem the problem was not clearing
the seamos and it was not flashing the
BIOS I did not need to flash the BIOS to
get the six core working again in here
and let me see what some of the other
some of the other good ideas were and
yeah no you know what I actually had a
lot of good comments a lot of good ideas
but none of them ended up being it it
ended up being a dead video card which
is strange because I did already test
with the GTX 260 and
yeah I didn't didn't have any luck on
that side either so you know it might be
a matter of going home and testing my
gtx 260 now as well to see if maybe
that's pride too that would be just
terrible luck so thank you for checking
out my video on installing 24 gigs of
ram in the a soos rampage 3 extreme</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
