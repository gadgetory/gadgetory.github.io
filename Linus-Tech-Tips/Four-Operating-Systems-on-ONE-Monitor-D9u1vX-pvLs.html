is it Windows 7 Mac OS Windows 10
Linux well we figured why decide we
built the ultimate cross-platform
workstation running all four of them off
of a single display and seamlessly check
out that Mouse movement between the
different OSS and this was thanks to
some help from our friends at synergy
who sponsored this video so stay tuned
because we are going to show you guys
how to do it
all right so let's go over what we've
got here first up is our computers so
this one right here this glass tower has
our arcade machine PC running Windows
seven and there are a lot of reasons
that you might still want an older
version of Windows up and running after
you've upgraded to something new maybe
it's older hardware provides better
compatibility with older software
especially games that don't play nicely
with Windows 10 maybe it's just that you
need Windows 10 for work or school but
you really love Windows 7 and it's
telemetry freestyles next up we've got
our Windows 10 PC now Windows 10
supports 4k Netflix with the built-in
edge browser
it's got DirectX 12 for the latest games
and of course pairing the newest
hardware with the most current operating
system often gives you the best driver
and accompanying software experience now
let's change gears a little bit this is
our MacBook Pro maybe you moonlight as a
DJ and you prefer the professional audio
tools or peripherals that work best or
only on Mac maybe you love Final Cut
maybe you love the tight integration
with your iPhone and your Apple watch
there are a ton of reasons that you
might want to have a Mac as part of your
ultimate setup so we worked it in
bringing us finally to a little mini
Intel nook this one right here is
running Linux Ubuntu to be precise so
maybe you're a programmer who needs to
be able to quickly compare different OS
builds side-by-side maybe you're a data
scientist who works primarily in Windows
but then needs to keep tabs on a Linux
machine without SSH or an X maybe some
of your tools just plain run best on
Linux
so overall the point we were trying to
make there wasn't the specific reasons
but just the fact that there are a lot
of reasons that you might want to run
multiple operating systems and while
there are a ton
ways to go about this actually all of
them come with some significant
drawbacks so a dual boot solution like
boot camp requires a system restart to
switch a TeamViewer introduces
significant network latency and reduced
image quality parallels or some other
kind of virtualization solution gives
you limited access to Hardware
pass-through and speaking of hardware a
hardware based KVM can be really
expensive if you want modern features
like 4k 60 Hertz support and it only
allows you to control one of your OS is
at a time so then let's walk you through
how we built our setup
one of the big pieces of special sauce
is actually the monitor this is the same
LG 43 u d 79 b that we checked out back
in September and we liked it okay at the
time but we saw it basically as a big
display a really big display at the time
and we hadn't fully figured out what we
could do with it
so it's got four HDMI ports two 2.0 and
21.4 then it also has check this out
it's also got DisplayPort and a USB
type-c for input and this is cool with
four machines plugged in you can arrange
those inputs in any order you'd like in
quadrants like this effectively giving
you four 21 and a half inch displays and
then you can choose which one of them is
going to output through the monitor
speakers now if you want to focus in on
one thing you can press the fullscreen
button here pick whichever one you'd
like press the button and boom you are
switched to that particular input 4k 60
Hertz depending on which one it's
compatible with and then if you want to
switch back we'll just go to picture by
picture you can just apply the previous
settings
and give it a couple seconds to pick up
all the different signals and you're
gonna be back to your quadrants now we
haven't fully solved the problem yet but
this is all the hardware we need but
here's our here's our current issue our
mouse is stuck in a bun - right now
because that is where it's plugged in
this is where synergy 2.0 software comes
in let's start with Windows the process
is the same on both Windows 7 and
Windows 10 download synergy 2.0 and
install it then sign in to activate your
machine once this is done you'll see a
representation of the computer you're
currently using in this case our arcade
on the synergy 2.0 app next up is our
Windows 10 machine this is basically the
same procedure but once we're done our
setup will see our arcade machine
already and then we'll be able to
arrange our Windows 10 machine to line
up according to how we've got our
displays arranged but wait there's more
moving over to the Mac the process is
actually just as simple open up the dmg
double click login and now we've got
three but we're still missing the last
piece of the puzzle Linux Linux can be a
bit trickier for our bun 217 point 10
install we have an easy-to-use debian
package but for those of you running
disc pros that have switched to Weiland
by default like newer versions of Ubuntu
you need to make sure that you log in
with xorg enabled otherwise it won't
work it's easy enough to work around but
just a little frustrating and here we
are now I can do what I showed you in
the intro so in this configuration watch
this I can just move my mouse cursor
between the machines seamlessly so over
here I could I could get logged into
steam but well I can I mash the Enter
key but you get my point
the keyboard actually moves with the
mouse so I could go to you know oh the
website still up and check this out
copy pasting text between the machines
is supported with copy pasting
files and dragging and dropping files
coming in synergy 2.0 quite shortly and
I think the most impressive thing is
just how quickly and seamlessly the
mouse switches between the different
machines cool right a setup like this
won't be practical for everyone and
there are some caveats so let's say you
wanted to take your MacBook with you and
you unplug it it does take a moment for
all the screens to sync up when
something you know disconnects or
reconnects and our bunchy machine has a
bit of a tendency to grab the mouse
controls even when it's not the focus
machine but I think there are people out
there with work areas that are only big
enough for a single monitor who might
have the need to run multiple machines
simultaneously like this and for those
people even with some of the
improvements that still need to be made
to synergy 2.0 there is potentially a
lot of time and effort to be saved here
but - I heard on your forum of all
places that while synergy 2.0 might be
prettier with brain-dead simple setup
it's still missing some of the features
of synergy 1 and there's no downgrade
rights yes yes you did hear that so did
we and so did seamless so while seamless
has been working on bringing back the
much requested tray icon and an on/off
button which would be essential for a
configuration like this so that when you
fullscreen you don't have your mouse
flying off the edges we worked out a
deal with them where anyone who bought
synergy one or two with our code the
links below our videos will get upgrade
and downgrade rights for free so you can
use whichever version you prefer and
then you can switch whenever you're
ready Ben so check out the link to
synergy one or two
in the video description to get their
multi-platform peripheral sharing
software today for 50% off
thanks to synergy for sponsoring this
video so thanks for watching guys if you
dislike this video you can press that
button but if you liked it hit like get
subscribed or check out the link to
where to buy the stuff we featured we'll
have the monitor down there we'll have
synergy down there in the video
