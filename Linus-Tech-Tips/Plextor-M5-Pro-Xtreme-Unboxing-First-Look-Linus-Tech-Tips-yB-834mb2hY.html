the Plextor
m5 pro xstream now the most important
thing about this Drive in comparison to
the previous generation m5 Pro is
actually that it's mostly been tuned it
also includes NTIA SSD solution suite
for Plextor and has a couple of
installation keys and backup now easy
installation keys so they've included
the any Drive utilities that you might
need with the drive which I don't
remember being included with the non
Extreme Edition there's a quick
installation guide as well as a limited
warranty card and of course the drive
itself now a lot of people might not
know this but Plextor is actually a
major SSD manufacturer they not only
make their own SSDs which are using
Marvell controllers with custom firmware
that include their true speed and true
protect technologies so true speed is
basically their way of saying that
regardless of sort of you know like the
drives use trim but regardless of all of
that the drive is constantly performing
maintenance on itself to keep it at or
near its brand-new performance and then
Tru protect basically means unparalleled
security and data accuracy so that
includes a full driving es encryption as
well as enterprise-grade features like
the burnin that they do on this drive so
they pretty much guarantee with like a
very very intensive burnin that you're
not going to get a DOA unit and that the
flash that they're using is of the
highest possible grade now the only
thing that's really changed between here
I'm gonna see if I can find it we're
actually going to be doing a round up on
NCIX tech tips with this drive and a
number of other high performance drives
so I'll I'll pick out sort of some of
the drives were going to look at vertex
for we're probably not going to include
em for I think isn't our results vector
will definitely be compared there's the
original m5 Pro so it looks pretty much
identical but with some tweaks they have
reached a hundred thousand I ops with
the new extreme edition so what that
means is that should put it right up
there with the Samsung to 840 s with the
Samsung 840 pro in terms of its read
performance so these are going to be the
drives that were mostly focused on here
because these are the top performing
drives in the market and
Lextran five pro xstream is priced like
a top drive it also has a five-year
warranty like the other top drive so
neutron GTX vector and Samsung's 840 pro
all have that same five-year warranty
and in terms of spec you can see the
reads and writes are sort of very very
impressive but it comes down to what we
find in the real world in terms of the
actual performance so thank you for
checking out my unboxing and first look
at the Plextor m5 pro extreme don't
