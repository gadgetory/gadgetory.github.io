a product from a soos this is the u3 s6
and u3 s6 stems for none other than USB
3 SATA 6 so this is a PCI Express 4x
with bringe card and basically they're
saying it is the only right choice now
as soon as talked quite a bit about how
their implementation of USB 3.0 and SATA
6 gigabits per second is better than
what anyone else on the market has so
they've worked the same technology into
their alien card as they have into their
motherboards that feature those feet
well feature have those features by
default so first thing reason number one
only with the plx bridge can they get
full speed yeah for your your USB and
3.0 and SATA 6 so you fully unleash that
your performance ok and reason number 2
is only with PCIe 4x will you have
enough bandwidth ok so what they're
saying is that they're using a plx chip
and they're also using a PCIe 4x
interface which is what they're saying
no one else on the market is doing so
here on the back they've got some graphs
that have little starbursts about
exclaiming stuff so USB 3.0 performance
test they're saying is 34% better than a
card using a 1x PCI Express slot and
then over here they're saying that for
SATA 6 gave it per second it's actually
50% faster than a card that uses a 1x
slot now over here we've got the general
specs and so it's gone oK you've got two
internal connectors and those are the
SATA 6 gigabits per second parts then
you have two external connectors those
are the USB 3 ports now you should note
that both of these are backwards
compatible with SATA 2 and SATA 1 and
with USB 2 and USB 1 respectively
very cool the interface is PCIe 4 as
they've talked about quite a bit on the
packaging the configuration supported is
a HDI mode alright and then for
compatible models you've got a list here
of compatible a seuss motherboard model
so you might want to check that out
before you go and buy one of these and
other than
that I guess there's not really too much
to show on the box so why don't we have
a look at the card itself okay there's
not a whole lot a photo okay there's
more included than I thought so the
first thing we find is a couple of right
angles SATA connector or SATA cables so
I'm going to go ahead and assume that
those are SATA 6 gigabits per second
ready mind you there's no actual
difference as far as I know you'd have
to have a pretty shoddy SATA cable for
it to not work with the new standard
next inside we find the user's guide
show that to the camera okay and also
included inside you have a driver CD so
don't use that download the latest
drivers off the assist website and in
here there's a couple couple different
things they've got the same summary that
they had on the back of the box and
thank you for buying and that's pretty
much it I mean I guess there's not a
whole lot to it you install the part you
can stall the driver and then you plug
stuff into it seems straightforward
enough well why don't we have a look at
the part itself uses a black PCB which I
always like to see I mean the last thing
you want to have is like a
high-performance smexy looking
motherboard and then you have to throw
like some ancient forest green PCI card
in it okay let me just make sure that my
zoom is actually working there okay so
it's a pretty busy looking PCB they've
actually got a lot of capacitors they've
got their plx chip right here in the
middle of it that's probably a lot of a
cost of this particular unit as well as
all of the components they're building
it you know I can't actually figure out
why this is such a busy PCB you can see
they're using the same NEC USB 3.0
chipset that almost everyone out there
is using right now and then for the SATA
6 chipset they're using a marvel chipset
so here are your SATA 6 gigabits per
second connectors okay so one at the
back one on the top and then on the back
of the card you've got your two USB 3.0
connectors and at the bottom you've got
the PCI Express 4x connection I guess
there's not really much more to say
about it than that so thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the US u3 s6</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
