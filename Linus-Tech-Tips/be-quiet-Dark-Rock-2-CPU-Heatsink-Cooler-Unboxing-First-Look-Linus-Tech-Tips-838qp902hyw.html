the be quiet
I'm sorry dark rock - no compromise
silence and performance up to 180 watt
TDP s-- will be up pretty much
everything CPU cooler LGA 2011 ready is
the silent wings fans which is like
excellent very quiet operation at 20 1.2
decibels Max 135 millimeters silent
wings PWM fan highly effective clean
completely dark nickel-plated single
tower layout that actually is pretty
appealing to people like me who love
that compatible with Intel and AMD
alright areas of applications safe
cooling of high performance peace even
extreme overclocking scenarios and it
seriously quiet PC systems with the
highest standards of performance
reliability highly effective cooling
very quiet operations Nexus silent wings
completely dark nipple play to this
table backplate ensures vibration secure
attachment even when the computer is
being transmitted transmitted
transported brushed aluminum cover
protects the cooling fins design and
quality control in Germany okay the core
minutes of our customer is a focus of
everything that we do tot cover 12 steel
heat pipe caps height adjustable um
height adjustable fan cool anti
vibration rubber ring cooling fins with
wave design six high performance heat
pipes alright and it should be noted
that it is a valid thing to say high
performance heat pipes because not all
heat pipes aren't you old my goodness
that actually looks really good dad that
looks just baller I'm I'm sort of sold
already and I actually haven't seen the
cooling yet this looks like a reasonably
smart mounting system so it looks like
they've got the kind where the things
cruise into the thing and then that
screws into the other thing similar to
what we've seen in the past although
there are a lot of pieces which sort of
gives me pause sometimes
mounting systems with lots of pieces can
be a little bit challenging to put
together let's have a look at what their
instructions are like though okay so
they're labeling everything pretty
clearly which is nice to see
so basically hmm here we go yeah so
that's LGA 2011 is what we're using this
for and that should be really easy so
you basically put this thing into the
the backplate that's already on the
socket and then the cooler screws into
that with these that these things here
or with something else that's also in
the package I suppose and then this is
going to be your AMD as well as older
Intel sockets or lesser intel socket
such as 2011 55 11 56 okay they've got
nice little exploded diagrams of
everything so it Shh
it'd be pretty straightforward let's go
ahead and check out the heatsink itself
this looks like a great backplate though
look how thick this thing is like it
actually has some weight to it Wow look
how thick that is here slight hold this
heavy right have ESD felt yeah there you
go guys and it's like solid it's like a
it's like solid piece of metal like
there's no flex to it whatsoever and it
has the the anti conductive coating is
already on it I've seen ones in the past
where you have to like put it on
yourself I'm just like that seems like a
safety hazard if someone's not going to
put it on someone's gonna short out
their expensive board which is gonna
destroy someone's CPU although some ones
are probably like the same person just
saying it like it's not like one person
is going to like short out their board
and someone else's CPU somewhere is
gonna die that's not really how it works
all right so that it's not 120mm fan
cuz that doesn't look like a 120 mil
that looks like a 140 oh yeah I was
probably using the hold on Slick's gave
me a hard time about something so yeah
it's a 135 millimeter fan and this is a
bit of a unique design because this
isn't like the regular case fan that we
unboxed before because it's using a
completely different mounting system
just for their CPU heatsink fan it's got
a rubber ring all around the outside
here so that means without any
cheesy like little rubber strips that
you have to sort of like stick to the
heatsink fans and then they fall off and
then you catch to them up I've had this
happen the fan will always have the
rubber layer on it which will keep
vibration from being transmitted to the
tower heatsink itself
I'd say about like an a - sort of dark
nickel plating I can see a couple small
blemishes but you'd never see them if
you weren't picky like me and the fact
that they've got this beautiful
beautiful brushed aluminum top piece
that looks outstanding I mean it sort of
makes up for it actually because you'll
never see the you'll never see the fins
themselves anyway have also got are
these really metal oh my goodness metal
caps on the tops of the heat pipes so
that you don't have to see the ugly
because you know how heat pipes have one
clean end and then they have one like
clamped shut end so that the fluid is
sealed inside so you don't have to see
which end is the ugly end and which end
is not the ugly and they've just got
capsule and looks outstanding
mounting mechanism is this is actually
one of my personal favorites the stretch
it over and put it wherever you want an
opening system so that's what they mean
by height adjustable I suppose because
you could actually put it up higher if
you had like a motherboard component
that's interfering with the fan or you
could put it down lower if you wanted
additional airflow over the over the vrm
of your motherboard for example then you
just kind of Lodge that in there
something you can get it in there we go
and just like that or does it yes it
does aha locked into place same thing on
the other side yes let's do the
obligatory finger shot so very shiny but
you can see some of the machining marks
in the base it should be noted guys I
mirror finish is not necessary for good
contact of the CPU in fact as you may or
may not have noticed your CPU is not
mirror finish on the bottom so it's not
like you were getting like perfect
mirror to mirror contact anyway but that
doesn't mean it's not flat though based
on a quick look it has a bit of a convex
shape to it which assuming you're
mounting with any kind of adequate
pressure can actually be an advantage
because metal does have some
plexins and give to it so if you're
making the best contact with the middle
and then putting a lot of pressure it'll
actually spread the contact patch a
little bit you'll get the best cooling
that way because the CPU dye itself
under the heat spreader is only about
yay big anyhow so something to note very
shiny heat pipes a little attention to
detail stuff see short see short
connector right why isn't everybody
doing this because the CPU power pen
header is never further away from like
you know the CPU then like here you know
this kind of radius so it makes a lot of
sense to do that and if it's a little
bit closer it looks a lot cleaner if you
know you give it a little little loop
like that and then just plug it in
really really close makes everything
look really clean if you have a longer
connector on the fan what it ends up
looking like is kind of cheesy I don't
know if I have yeah I do have another
one so this for example is a CPU fan
intended to be installed on a CPU so you
comes like a bracket to attach it to the
cooler so if you pull that trick on this
one it still ends up looking kind of
stupid cuz it's huge whereas if you have
a nice short short cable then it can
look really really clean so I think that
pretty much covers it thank you for
