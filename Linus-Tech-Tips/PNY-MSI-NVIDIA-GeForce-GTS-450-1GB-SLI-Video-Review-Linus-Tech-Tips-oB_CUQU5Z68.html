things first of all it is meant to be as
somewhat of a review of the PNY GeForce
GT s 450 that I did unbox a little while
back okay it is also meant to be a look
at SLI performance with the PNY GTS 450
as well as the MSI cyclone GTS 450 now
these are both very similar cards I'm
going to stop holding up the box and
instead I'm actually going to hold up
the PNY card itself now they're quite
similar cards you can actually see now
that we have them side-by-side they do
use the same reference PCB design okay
so the biggest difference is the cooler
we did a cooler comparison but remember
these cards will work just fine an SLI
mode so that's what we were able to
benchmark them in so I want you to have
a look at my test bench here and I'm
just going to show you what I was using
for this particular little video review
I've got a Core i7 860 running at 3.8
gigahertz down there and that is with
hyper-threading on all right I've got 4
gigs of kingston hyperx h2o ram don't
even bother trying to look at that it's
way in the back it looks like this I
have a third stick here ok so that's
what that looks like
alright then we've got an a' seuss
motherboard which is both SLI and
crossfire compatible which was necessary
for the testing today and this is all
running off in ocz vertex series SSD all
right so let's have a look at all the
cards that we run with today you can see
we've got the GTX 480 in there as a
reference point okay we've got the 5870
as a reference point as well so the
whole point today was to see how does to
mid range or really value performance
cards like the 450 or the 57 70 so you
can see we've tested with a single as
well as with dual 57 70s as well how
does two more mid-range cards compared
to a single high-end card from each
vendor and then how does the Nvidia
offering compared to the ATI offering I
also threw in the GTX 460 cyclone
Edition because I did have it on hand
and it's such a popular card right now I
figured ok well that'll be a good
reference point for people as well so
stay tuned I'm going to do boring
benchmark
laughs and before then I'm going to show
you all the settings I was using in the
games that we did test one of the games
we tested obviously Crysis is still a
benchmark for optimal system performance
under incredible load if it can run
Crysis really well then typically it can
run most games fairly well although that
is changing there are some fairly
demanding games coming out these days
we're running at 1680 by 1050 which is a
perfectly reasonable resolution for our
mainstream level cards but what you'll
discover when we show you the graphics
benchmarks the benchmark numbers is that
some of the higher end cards do start to
get CPU bottlenecked at that resolution
and we don't see scaling even with more
impressive graphics cards again once
again this is mainstream cards that were
mostly having a look at so I'm using all
of the medium presets for crisis here's
the settings we used for mafia 2 but I
do want you to note one thing the apex
physics engine here is off because I do
have a Radeon card on the platform right
now but I did run it two separate ways
for all the Nvidia cards I ran it once
with Apex physics on high and then once
with it off so the only time I'm going
to compare against Radeon cards is with
physics off but it should be noted that
this game does have substantial gameplay
innovations that rely on physics that
really you're not getting the ideal
experience from unless you have physics
on Madden Arkham Asylum yeah I know this
game is not that new but frankly I don't
care I really enjoyed it so I'm going to
go ahead and benchmark it all so it
serves as a reference point as an unreal
3 engine game so that allows us to find
out how these cards will compare against
each other in a pretty wide variety of
games so these are the settings that we
did use and you can see once again here
I have hardware accelerated physics off
but I had it set to high with the
supported Nvidia cards and so what I'll
do is I'll show you again two points of
comparison one with physics off with all
of the cards in the mix and then one
with high with only the Nvidia cards
you
so in conclusion that was my second
video review and I had so many people
requesting it I couldn't help but do
more I guess there's not really too much
to say I mean you've seen the numbers
already and really the prices haven't
really haven't settled enough for the
GTS 450 Series cards to really make a
clear recommendation in terms of FPS per
dollar or some kind of a hard-line
measurement but well we can see is that
the cards do scale quite well in SLI
they do perform quite well for their
price point and if you want to check it
out here I just hope you've all enjoyed
this review of the PNY GTS 450 as well
as these sli running review I mean I
guess it's uh it's more of a review of
both of these cards than only one but I
hope you've enjoyed it and I also wanted
to make a special note here in the
conclusion that I totally forgot about
before I am running the absolute latest
driver revisions for all of these cards
so that means the latest to 60 download
from the Nvidia website as well as
catalyst 10.9 for all of the ATI cards
so these are pretty much the most
up-to-date numbers that you can get for
any of these cards don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips and I hope
you've enjoyed our video review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
