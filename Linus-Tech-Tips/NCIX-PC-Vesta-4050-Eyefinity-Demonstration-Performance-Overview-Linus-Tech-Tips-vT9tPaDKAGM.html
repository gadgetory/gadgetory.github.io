company 2 going on our eyefinity setup
here the point of this video is mostly
about no one we can combat area it is
mostly about affordable eyefinity with
the radio on 6800 series much like the
one that i recently did with the 3 HD
TVs something that you should know is
that 3 1080p monitors vs 3 1080p tvs
actually requires exactly the same video
horsepower and processing power it
doesn't matter how big the screen is or
there are some comments on the video
actually asking about that but it does
not matter how good the screen is the
only important thing is what the
resolution you're running at is so we're
going to talk a little bit about the
best of 40-50 which is a new NCIX pc for
this month and how well it performs in
some modern games at full of people so
let's talk a little bit about the design
process of the best of 40 50 is actually
based on a music vision black platform
so what that means is that we're using
an AMD chipset which is required for
crossfire on a AMD platform with AMD
video carts hence the AMD vision
platform moniker so we're using an AMD
chipset in here that is crossfire ready
we're also using AMD's 6 core processors
so even though not all of the six core
processors actually have the black
designation they are all AMD vision
black ready so depending whether you get
the base package or the performance
package you're looking at either the 10
55 or the 1090t processors we're also
using a radeon 6870 so this is the
performance package which means that the
system we have running here has a 1090t
it has corsair xms3 memory it has a WD
black series hard drive it also has a 68
70 as well as an upgraded power supply
versus the base version and it's only 11
99 compared to 999 on the base package
do you ever press the button one
advantage that a system based round AMD
vision gives you is that you know that
you're going to end up with reasonably
well matched components if you check out
Amy's website they've got lots of vision
guidelines so for example if you choose
a CPU out of vision basic you're going
to end up with something that's way
underpowered for a video card that's
listed under vision black so that comes
back to the bottleneck video we actually
did quite recently where we talked about
matching up your components so that they
are appropriate for each other to give
you a well balanced performance
experience now while most modern games
will run in eyefinity mode and that is
across three monitors not every modern
game will so starcraft 2 is an example
of a current game that only runs in 4 x
3 16 by 9 and 16 x 10 aspect ratio so
we're running in 16 x 10 right now this
is on a 1680 x 1050 monitor going to go
ahead and start this time of a timeout
time demo big props to sky MTL are Mike
from Hardware Canucks he actually
provided us with this time demo and the
reason that's so important is because
we've actually taken the results with
this time devil at 1080 and that means
that you can compare it against the
starcraft two benchmarks that mike has
actually run on his website so if you go
to Hardware cox com we actually get
about 50 frames per second average and a
33 at the low point and that's at 1920 x
1200 so you can compare that against the
systems that sky MTL is using in his
review so that's pretty cool and I
believe he's also going to make this
time demo available to anyone who wants
it in the near future so you can compare
your current system against systems that
are benchmarked on harbor Canucks
against the LUN that we're showing here
today so we're just showing some combat
sequence stuff going on here I think
this is if you get to about twenty eight
and a half minutes into the time demo
you run into where you start to see a
lot of movement and hopefully we're
getting close now yeah we're getting
really close so in terms of the other
benchmarks we've already shown you this
info
benchmarks where we scored just over
15,000 marks in 3dmark Vantage here i'm
going to move so you can see the inside
of the system it's not incredibly quiet
power consumption is very reasonable
though so even running a game right now
we're pulling about 262 wats from the
wall which means we're pulling less than
250 watts from our power supply now
bearing in mind that most games are not
all that CPU intensive so you're mostly
taxing just the graphics card this power
supply will give you room to either
configure the system with two graphics
cards or upgraded in the future so
that's always good to know and what else
did I want to mention I think okay we've
got power consumption down I think
that's pretty much it thank you for
checking out this little video on the
Vesta 40-50 system and don't forget to
subscribe to- tech tips something else I
wanted to mention is that with this
system we're also advertising an LCD
monitor bundle so you can actually set
up three 22 inch monitors there from
benq and it also includes the eyefinity
adapter that you need because remember
one of the monitors has to run off
DisplayPort so it's a passive single
link eyefinity adapter which will allow
you to run your three monitors without
any hassle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
