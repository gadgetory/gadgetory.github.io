us with an idea for a sponsored video
about a computer it involves building
one up demonstrating the purpose that we
built it for in Tiffany Boppity out
comes a video we've pretty much got that
down to a science at this point with
ibuypower
life wasn't really that simple the
computer is already built it's stress
tested and it's boxed up before we ever
get our hands on it so we figured well
let's just do the whole thing in Reverse
welcome to the first-ever
unbuild log where we take apart the
machine rather than putting it together
featuring the iBUYPOWER revolt to drop a
like on this video if you guys liked
this concept and you want to see more of
it
so it starts then with software
iBUYPOWER gets full marks for including
zero bloat I mean not even a Microsoft
Office trial with the revolt - with two
exceptions everything in the add/remove
programs menu is a legitimate utility
for the hardware in the system or it was
installed by me I would personally
remove the msi registration utility but
the lighting controller software the
other one of the two gets to stay since
it's very lightweight and enables a
variety of cool effects from solid
colors to breathing - rainbow - off if
you're into the whole simplicity thing
performance wise like with any custom
built system since you could put a
Celeron and a GT 210 in there if you
really wanted to you'll get exactly what
you pay for as long as the system
builder has effectively managed the
thermals of the Machine and ibuypower
seems to have done just that in spite of
the revolt twos diminutive size our CPU
never cleared about 65 degrees on the
hottest core in I 264 and our GPU stuck
under 50 degrees with Unigine heaven
extreme looping all of this while
staying exceptionally quiet great
results here so let's start tearing her
apart then shall we I buy power didn't
actually explain what the deal with the
peripherals was so apparently sometimes
it comes with some and sometimes not but
sometimes others the mouse is frankly
terrible so I wouldn't worry too much
about that with the mouse pad and the
mechanical keyboard that they threw and
would be nice to have included with the
system because they're not too shabby
side panel disassembly was pretty
straightforward there's two thumb screws
and it pops right off an interesting
note here though is that you can
actually remove the plastic fascia piece
revealing actually kind of a slick
looking metal panel with what looks like
a spot for a window perhaps another like
slimmed down version coming down the
line
next I undid the cable management for
the RGB lighting controller it's got
three connectors USB for that software
control I showed you before a three pin
for the LED strip and a DC plug for
power then there's really not much else
that we can access from this side
although we do get a look at the dual
120 millimeter radiators that are
responsible for that cool quiet
operation the SSD mount in the front is
accessed by simply lifting the giant
window in the front then it can actually
be removed with a single thumb screw the
SATA ports are pre-wired up kind of like
a backplane and you can mount up to two
SSDs and the drive sled then just pop
them in very very nice our machine is
equipped with a single 240 gig a data
SSD the second side panel reveals well
most of the rest of the inside so you've
got the power supply the video card and
the hard drive the power supply is a bit
of an odd choice to me the RM 750 is a
750 watt power supply so kind of
overkill for a system like this although
consumers think they need ginormous
power supplies for their systems so I
can't put too much of the blame on
iBUYPOWER for obliging them but the
bigger question mark for me with this
one is why choose a power supply with a
hybrid fan mode since you're relying on
that fan to pull the vrm area of the
motherboard and the system memory so I'd
recommend that I buy power stick with
power supplies that keep their fan
engaged even if at a very low rpm to
eliminate a potential hot spot there the
video card choice reveals why those
temperatures were so freakin awesome
this is a to the 9 sort of configuration
and it's got an EVGA gtx 980ti with a
hybrid air and water cooler that means
fresh air is drawn through the bottom of
the case through that radiator then
reused again through the air cooler
before being exhausted out the top rear
of the chassis and you can argue till
you're blue in the face about reusing
air to cool something twice but the
proof is in the pudding and fat results
is some pretty tasty pudding the hard
drive mount in the front contains
one terabyte three and a half inch WD
blue but you could put in anything you
want on imo boot SSD and mass storage
three and a half inch hard drive is
still the way to go but that may change
in the next couple of years though
thankfully because of the dual SSD
mounts on the front I by powers leaving
room in the future for mass storage SSDs
to go along with your boot SSD something
that much kin wants to happen sooner
rather than later with that four
terabyte drive they announced for five
hundred bucks with the power supply
removed to get a good look at the rest
of the guts here ITX boards are pretty
much universally limited to two DIMM
slots and ours is equipped with 16 gigs
of a data ddr4 2400 megahertz but thanks
to ddr4 already improved ram density
consumer grade 16 gig sticks are
available giving the revolt to up to 32
gigs of capacity for CPU cooling it's
handled by a corsair h 55 that has
actually some of the most creative
tubing management that i think i've ever
seen the tubes are vic tied into the
nooks and crannies around the CPU socket
then crammed under the power supply
bracket in a way that i would have
thought would make it kink but didn't
end up doing so leading us finally to
the CPU and motherboard so that chip
under the age 55 cooler is an Intel Core
i7 6700 K skylake quad core with hyper
threading that's top of the line on the
consumer end of Intel's lineup and then
our motherboard is an MSI gaming model
that a puts our machine with
compatibility for Wi-Fi and got two SSDs
and of course all the hardware inside
which I guess kind of concludes our
first-ever unbilled log with the
iBUYPOWER riverwalt 2 I hope it was as
interesting for you guys as it was for
me to tear this baby apart and see
exactly how they handled all the cooling
and cable management of this unique
little system that I first covered a
month ago at CES 2016 so thanks for
watching guys if this video sucked you
know what to do but if it was awesome
