stuff on this channel gtx titan XPS
Extreme Edition CPUs and the like mostly
it's for the wow factor because you guys
seem to love that stuff but that doesn't
mean that that's what any of you
actually buy so what does the typical
LTT viewer buy to find out I went
through our entire Amazon Associates
report for last month all seven thousand
six hundred and ninety line items of it
to find the most popular PC components
in the list and put together what I'm
calling the viewers Choice Award
computer I also found some other really
interesting stuff in there you guys be
freaky
intel skull canyon nook features a 6th
generation Core i7 quad-core processor
and Thunderbolt 3 learn more at the link
in the video description the CPU was a
shocker I said very clearly to our I
thought gamer heavy audience in last
month's video entitled what CPU should I
buy
but I didn't recommend anything higher
than the core i5 6600 K for gamers but
more than all other CPUs combined the
most popular choice was the core i7 6700
K with half of those folks evidently
opting for cooler masters great value if
not particularly amazing hyper 212 Evo
heatsink to go with it most people chose
Corsair Vengeance LP X memory with the
mode average speed being 3200 megahertz
and the most popular capacity being a
single 2 by 8 gig kit for Chrome far and
away the most popular motherboard was
the Asus z170a which outsold the rest of
a Seuss's lineup put together so it
looks like then my message about
higher-end motherboards not performing
any better came through loud and clear
with most of you not valuing the extra
features on the higher-end models video
cards were the most popular computer
component purchases among our viewers
with Nvidia holding 87 percent of the
market share by units and a staggering
95.1% by revenue though it would appear
that our viewers at least the ones who
shop at Amazon using our code skew
heavily toward the high end the gtx 1070
and 1080 combined for over half of all
video card sales on our report I mean
these are 450 and $700 cards then on the
board partner side of things EVGA was
alone out front with a soos gigabyte and
msi all battling hard for the number 2
spot and the top-selling video card
overall then was a tie between the EVGA
gtx 1080
TWU gaining and MSI's gaming GTX 1070
maybe putting gaming in the product name
really does work at least on Amazon
where it's damn near impossible to use
the filters to find anything storage was
a landslide victory the Samsung 850 Evo
outsold the rest of Samsung's lineup and
everyone else combined with 500 gigs as
the most popular capacity by far this is
what happens I guess when Intel just
doesn't refresh their SATA SSDs except
when they feel like it though in Intel
and microns defense Samsung's
industry-leading TLC 3d NAND flash and
accompanying controller technology makes
them very hard to compete against
without losing your shirt on every sale
most of our viewers unsurprisingly chose
the cheaper OAM Windows 10 home but this
is cool about a third of them went with
retail copies of Windows 10 on a USB
Drive instead of a download or a disk
something I suspect more people would do
if they knew it was available for 30
bucks more than OEM and the same cost as
the download one with the more flexible
retail copy license terms the most
popular power supply was a bit of a
surprise to me but maybe it shouldn't
have been EVGA supernova 650 G 180 plus
gold 650 watt unit has a fully modular
interface and a 10 year warranty both of
which likely allowed it to handily beat
out the rest of the crowded power supply
market the case was sort of a tie
actually both the NZXT s340 and fantex
eclipse p400s sold the same number of
units but fantex moved almost as many of
the $10 cheaper and nearly identical P
400 so I'm going to give them the win
here and it's a really impressive case
for 70 to 80 bucks for cooling fans this
was another are you guys even paying
attention moment for me
Corsairs AF Series was far and away the
most popular
to be clear I've got no issue of Corsair
fans but the SP series is
better all-rounder I know it Corsair
knows it
how many AF variants do they even have
of their newer lineup so why are you
guys buying AF swen SPS are available on
two monitors I'm giving the win to a sir
with the AR 2 4 th WB ID X IPs 23.8 inch
the dell SE 24 60 HX also a 23 inch IPS
sold more units but it was one guy
buying ten of them in one shot that
pushed it over the edge versus
individual buyers so one person really
liking something a lot doesn't make it
popular peripheral wise y'all have very
expensive taste in mice with the
logitech g502 proteus spectrum on a
SteelSeries qck mouse pad taking care of
your RGB desk decoration needs more of
you went with CM storm quickfire Rapids
than any other keyboard though I did
notice that keyboard sales seemed a
little tepid I mean maybe if you push
out enough mechanical keyboards that can
handle 50 million keystrokes before they
break people stop needing new ones at a
certain point and Kingston's HyperX
cloud to gaming headset was trailed
closely by Sennheiser's HD 598 special
edition and the antlion mod mic either
of which are great choices for a
headphone or headset we've got smart
viewers sometimes so let's throw up a
summary of our viewers choice PC here
while I go over some other highlights
we'll have links of course to where you
can buy all this stuff in the video
description so more of you by Microsoft
Xbox wireless adapters than I expected
and tp-link seems to be the go-to for a
cheap and cheerful Network switch oh and
we sold a whopping 5 Swingline stapler
it looks like at least some of you have
learned that it's better to buy your own
than to steal one from someone else for
like $12 on the subject though of that
last item which isn't strictly speaking
tech there were a lot of cool things
that I encountered more than enough to
do a full segment of cool and weird
stuff our community buys on Amazon or
maybe if you have a suggestion for what
we should call it you could post that
below
but with all the flak that I take every
time we deviate ever so slightly from
technology with some going as far as to
complain when we talk about tech that
isn't pcs hopefully you can understand
my hesitation here so let me know in the
comments did you like the PC version of
this should we start tracking that
regularly and looking for trends do you
want to see the non tech stuff as a
separate segment I promise you I will
definitely be reading speaking of
reading read my lips
