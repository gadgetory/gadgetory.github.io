wisely and they fell okay so today we've
got the my net and 750 this is slightly
higher than the n 600 meaning for your
dual band speeds you've got one for 50
megabit per second stream and one 300
megabits per second stream giving you a
total of 750 and slightly lower end than
the n900 which has two four hundred and
fifty megabit per second streams this
one also has gigabit ports better range
than the N 600 and also has easy setup
also has fast track streaming fast track
streaming which I will go over in a
moment also supports Full HD which is
bloody well better it has Gigabit and
750 and has four gigabit ports which I
already talked about I fast track HD
entertainment so let's talk about what
fast track does exactly fast track is
profiles that WD builds into the lower
end routers the end 600 and the N 750
that I was expecting him to come look at
this while I'm there we go
fast track basically is profiles that WD
builds into the firmware that takes your
frequently used gains and applications
and turns them into priorities so
instead of doing manual ki OS manual
quality of service which you do with
most traditional routers WD provides all
the profiles all you gotta do is turn
fast track on and it'll automatically
prioritize things like Skype over you
know your brother who's torrenting in
the next room you're like I'm trying to
talk to Grandma he's like I'm trying to
play League of Legends and you're like
no I'm trying to talk to grandma and you
have these conversations it's just
pointless it's stupid just get one of
these then you'll have to worry about it
anymore it'll automatically prioritize
so moving right along here's the help me
choose things so the benefits I can
already covered this you get four
gigabit ports versus the four Fast
Ethernet ports on the end 600 you get
two USB two parts so WD is a storage
company they do want you to buy a hard
drive to use with your mind net router
in order to you know back things up and
store your data in one place access it
from wherever you want if you get a
compatible Western Digital drive such as
a my book life you can actually even use
your router as kind of
an apple time capsule replacement with
time machine although it's compatible
with Windows utilities as well one two
three steps set up 24/7 customer support
and this one is rated for multiple HD
streams over Wi-Fi I mean I think that's
it's optimistic at the best of times I
think if you're getting one full HD
stream over Wi-Fi over any kind of
distance you should probably be pretty
happy but who knows that could be wrong
I'm just unboxing it now I haven't
actually sat down and tested it yet the
mind of dashboard gives you a simple
view if your essential settings more
access when you do remote access with WD
to go so these are apps that are
available that you can use as well as
the WD Photos app more simplicity okay
easy to auto configure advanced queue or
less yes that's that fast-track feature
parental controls an internet security
network diagnostic tool Auto sensing
port technology and internet amplifiers
so that's what makes this one higher
range than the n 600 in terms of
included accessories there's not a whole
lot there the power brick there's
warranty as well as technical support
phone numbers for you there's a start
here which has steps for Mac steps for
Windows as well as a disk as well as an
Ethernet port an Ethernet port which you
can plug this Ethernet cable into what I
meant to say alright let's have a look
at the physicality of the router there's
your power LED or wireless LED or
wireless LED yes wireless LED your
internet LED and your WPS LED there's
your for that on the top it's
sort of matte and sort of shiny it's
actually got kind of a nice look to it
can you see that the camera doesn't look
good looks good yeah diesels giving me
the nod okay so you've got power switch
power in four gigabit ports internet
port and then to storage ports which is
actually really cool and again WD is a
storage company they want you to like
get more storage and I personally
totally believe in that storage I'm a
big nas like dye this is a little basic
for me I actually have like some pretty
high-end ass stuff going on but hey if
you don't have any network backup
already you will thank yourself if you
throw a centralized backup on here next
time a computer hard drive crashes or
anything bad happens
you need to recover some bait off of it
you'll will yes will break yourself plus
being able to access your files while
you're on the go on your tablet or your
phone or whatever other device is very
cool as well so thank you for checking
out my unboxing and first look at the WD
my net and 750 don't forget to subscribe
