core series processor aka codename
Haswell overclocking guide we're going
to show you how to get the most out of
your new CPU in only a few simple steps
let's start with the basic benefits of
overclocking I actually had someone ask
me about this the other day you know
what is computer overclocking and I was
trying to explain well you take the
parts that you would normally buy and
then you turn them up in speed and you
can increase the voltage to make sure
the stability stays right and basically
you're getting more performance than
what you actually paid for and this
individual said to me oh so it's kind of
like overclocking your phone and I said
yes
overclocking is overclocking whether
it's a PC or phone the idea is you want
more performance and you don't
necessarily want to pay any more for the
actual processor but of course I have to
tell you guys the dangers of
overclocking overclocking can result or
will result in higher heat output more
power consumption it can result in
instability or shorter life time for
your components and very very rarely it
can result in outright death of
components but as long as you're using
high quality stuff and going about it in
a safe and responsible manner
you likely won't run into this kind of
trouble now the good news is that for
CPUs in particular intel has an
overclocking extended warranty that you
can actually buy for it and they'll
replace it for you just like that even
if you kill it
during overclocking now it would be
irresponsible of me also to not give you
guys the luck of the draw disclaimer
overclocking is running things outside
of their specifications they are not
guaranteed to do these things so if you
happen to get a CPU that runs at exactly
stock speed and only stock speed that's
life you can't return it because it's a
bad overclocker it doesn't work that way
it do overclocks or it doesn't and
that's great if it does so whatever we
do today you might get the same results
as us better results than us or much
worse results than us and that'll be
just kind of luck of the draw without
further ado let's get into it
now planning out an overclocking capable
build does take a little bit more work
than just your average PC you can't
cobble together whatever you want and
expect to get great overclocking
performance and it starts with the CPU
you're going to choose either an extreme
addition if you're on the very high end
or a k-series processor because those
are the ones that have what are called
unlocked multipliers allowing you to
turn the CPU frequency up and down at
will and test them and actually run them
at those speeds now we're using a 4770k
this is a Haswell fourth generation CPU
and you can expect somewhere in the
range of 4.4 to 4 point 5 gigahertz for
most 4770k s and then if you're lucky
and you're in the top 30% you might get
around 4.6 in the top 20% you might get
around 4.7 gigahertz and in the top 10%
of CPUs you will be able to get 4.8
gigahertz or more if you also build a
system around it that is capable of
taking advantage of that now that bit I
mentioned before about how it'll
increase the thermal output you need
better cooling to get the most out of an
overclock so in our case we're going to
be using an Corsair H 100 I this is a
dual 120 millimeter radiator liquid
cooling system however it should be
noted that you can still get very good
overclocking out of something like a
duel tower heatsink such as this thermal
right Silver Arrow extreme or something
like a knock to a NHD 14 for our
motherboard we've gone with the Maximus
six extreme from Asus and as the name
suggests this is a bit of an extreme
option and you don't really need that
for a mainstream overclock pretty much
any ACC 87 board has the same digital
power delivery as well as UEFI BIOS
optimizations that up to multipliers
such as 48 or 4.8 gigahertz they are
pretty much all going to be able to
achieve those results now the key
difference with high-end boards such as
the deluxe WS series tough series or rog
series is going to be in things like the
overall build quality the extras that
are included things like the OC panel
that I have in front of me as well as
their beefy vrm solutions both in terms
of the
design and the cooling that allow them
to stay stable at even much higher
frequencies than your typical
motherboard particularly with the rog
series you also get a degree of tweaking
and tinkering that is not available with
other motherboards for our memory we've
gone with corsair dominator Platinum's
these are twenty four hundred megahertz
modules they're eight gig dims meaning
we've got 32 gigs of ram in this system
but this was mostly for stress testing
it should be noted that while most
Haswell CPUs are capable of running at
2.8 gigahertz to 3 gigahertz on the
memory remember the integrated memory
controller effects this it tends to we'd
be reduced a lot as you increase the CPU
speed so once you get up to around 4.6
gigahertz 1600 megahertz is pretty much
a guarantee with anything above that
being gravy and most of them can't do
more than around 21 33 megahertz on RAM
once you ramped up the CPU clock speed
this becomes especially true with
high-density kits and when you populate
all the dims in your motherboard so we
use this kit mostly to push the platform
to its absolute limit and because
Dominator Platinum's are so sexy a good
quality power supply such as the ax 1200
I although calling it good quality is a
bit of an understatement allows the
power that's delivered to your system to
be cleaner and more consistent meaning
it will can be more stable in addition
to being able to power more components
such if you wanted to add more graphics
cards or whatever else later this
particular one is also extremely
efficient rated at 80 plus platinum and
is validated for the lower C states that
has well as capable of going into C
states allow you to save power but they
require your power supply to be stable
not only at very high wattages but also
incredibly low wattages so make sure
that your power supply whether you're
overclocking or not for a Haswell system
is validated for c6 and c7 States now
the rest of these components don't
really affect overclocking performance
directly but our Intel 335 series SSD
enables us to boot up more quickly after
failed overclocking attempts are knock
to a 120 millimeter fans allow us to
have the radiator still
very well but also not be loud and our
GTX 780 is a great match for a 4770k
once it's overclocked
allowing us to have beastly system
performance now it should also be noted
that VGA hotwire is a feature supported
by certain asu's motherboards and
graphics cards that allows you to
directly over bolt your graphics card
using the motherboard so check that out
if you're looking for a great
motherboard graphics card pairing as
well and here we go step one of
overclocking is to not overclock I
recommend updating your motherboard to
the latest BIOS setting those settings
all to default make sure all your fans
are spinning make sure your CPU is
stable run the i-264 built-in CPU
testing tool as well as a couple passes
of mem test 86 plus at bone-stock
settings because if you have problems
before you even start overclocking
you're going to have a bad time as soon
as you do start overclocking step is
your software toolkit so you'll need
some kind of application for monitoring
the status of your CPU such as CPU Z or
in this case we're using the built-in
one in I 264 you will need something for
stress testing and normally we were
using prime95 in the past but what
prime95 does do well is it tests maximum
heat output of the CPU and there are
similar tools such as Linux or Intel
burn tests but what the i-264 system
stability test does well is it allows
the CPU to not only run really hot but
it also tests other components such as
the new instruction sets that are built
into Haswell giving us a more complete
picture of the overall system stability
last but not least we're going to need
some kind of temperature monitoring
program typically in the past I've used
real temp GT but what you might notice
about Haswell is that the CPU
temperatures under load are going to be
very bouncy they're going to move around
a lot it's going to give you peaks but
not necessarily an average so asus has
actually built a thermal probe into
their motherboards themselves now that
you can read using AI suite or in our
case we're using the OC panel right here
to read it that'll give you a more
realistic view of how the CPU is running
under load I always recommend keeping
some other device next to you while your
overclock
such as a notebook or a tablet so that
you can look things up and reference
them while you're working not every
board has downloadable profiles like the
ROG series boards and it can be a
godsend if you can go on a forum such as
Linus tech tips com find other people
who have similar hardware configurations
who are able to help you and if you can
do that at the same time as working on
the machine then so much the better the
last thing you need before you get
started is this set aside some time for
the overclocked budget yourself some
time where you assume that your system
is not going to be fully functional
because a rushed sloppy overclock is a
bad overclock that can cause instability
crashes or even operating system
corruption you don't want to rush it
because at the end of the day if your
system crashes and takes with it a bunch
of your work or whatever else it could
cost you more time and headache and
frustration than if you just done it
right in the first place now I know this
makes me a little old school because
there are lots of software utilities
that allow you to do this kind of stuff
within Windows and the extreme
motherboard we have here has the OC
panel that allows you to change most of
these parameters but not everyone is
going to be working with that so I'm
mashing delete or f2 or some other
boards have different buttons to get
into the UEFI or BIOS that allows us to
change all the settings that we need to
change the first setting will be having
a look at is the CPU core ratio also
known as the CPU multiplier it's called
that because you've got your base clock
which is a hundred megahertz by default
and a multiplier that gives you your
final CPU clock speed so if you had a
setting of forty four you'd be at forty
four hundred megahertz or 4.4 gigahertz
and at a setting of forty eight you'd be
at forty eight hundred megahertz or 4.8
gigahertz now there's more to it than
just that and you've got a couple of
different options so you press ENTER to
go into those options and you've got
Auto which is your stock speed including
Intel's turbo boost technology which
allows you to go to higher speeds when
fewer cores are under load your next
setting is sync all course this allows
you to change that multiplier and it'll
change all the cores at the same time
and lock them there so they'll all move
together regardless of what kind of
load is on the CPU finally you've got
the perk or option this allows you to
build kind of like your own turbo boost
technology but an overclocked one so you
could set a multiplier of maybe 50 X
when you're only using one core or 48
when you're using two cores or whatever
the case may be you can play around with
it a fair bit the next setting we need
is one of the most important ones so
we're going to scroll down down down
down down an extreme Tweaker here and
we're going to get to CPU voltage now we
can turn up the frequency all you want
but at the end of the day if you don't
increase the voltage you're not going to
increase your stability and the amount
of power you can deliver to the CPU and
you're not going to be stable it's not
going to work so CPU voltage allows us
to compensate for the increases in
frequency and make the system stable the
problem is that the more voltage you add
to your CPU the more heat output will
come out of your CPU so you need to add
more cooling and it will also decrease
the overall lifespan of your CPU going
past a certain point now there are
actually a number of different ways that
you can change CPU voltage on this
platform so you can see we're in full
manual mode right now but I'm going to
change that so now I've got Auto which
is self-explanatory manual mode which
allows me to key in a voltage and have
it stay there the advantage of this is
that random applications like stress
tests can ask for too much voltage and
overpower my cooling solution more on
that a little bit later and the
disadvantage is that when the CPU is in
a low-power state idling at the desktop
I can't take advantage of any of the
power savings that Haswell brings to me
next up we've got offset mode so this
allows me to take my stock CPU voltage
remember that voltage bounces around a
lot depending what's going on to give
you that balance between power and power
savings offset voltage takes whatever
your stock ones are and bumps them up a
notch so this gives you the power you
need when you're running at an
overclocked setting but it doesn't scale
all the way back down when you're idling
and not doing anything that's where
adaptive comes in so adaptive is the one
I'd recommend using as your daily driver
setting when you're not actually tuning
in an overclock because what adaptive
does is it gives you the power you need
at full load and scales all the way back
down to
default voltages when you're not really
doing anything
the only drawback of adaptive is that
certain stress tests such as prime95
can actually override your maximum
adaptive voltage that you set and draw
too much power like if you set a voltage
of 1.25 for your cpu that that
application could cause up to 1.3 7
volts to be drawn through your CPU
causing instability or overwhelming your
cooling so guys manual mode for dialing
in the overclock then when you're
completely done switch over to adaptive
to get that power savings benefit now on
some older platforms it was really
recommended to disable a lot of the
power management features such as
intel's lower sea states as well as
things like speed step that turns the
frequency of the CPU down when it's not
really doing anything on has well that
hasn't really been found to affect
overclocking in any way so it's great
because you get to leave all that stuff
enabled while enjoying better
performance under load our next setting
is d rams frequency one two three four
five six and eight yes in there now if
we were going to leave our CPU at
default and just set our ram to 2.4
gigahertz we could do that but I
recommend like I said before finding
your CPU overclock before trying to turn
your ram up so we're going to dial our
ran into 1600 megahertz and leave it
there until we're done testing the CPU
for our next trick ram voltage now Ram
voltage is helpful when overclocking Ram
in much the same way that you add more
CPU voltage to overclock your cpu most
kids these days with the exception of
low-power ones run at around 1 point 6 5
volts but if you're ever not sure look
at the side of your memory to find out
and I really don't recommend changing it
much beyond that stock voltage because
honestly increasing RAM speeds doesn't
affect many applications that much
things like games don't get much benefit
from additional RAM speed on the Haswell
platform however there are exceptions to
these rules such as if you run a lot of
virtual machines you will get a big
benefit out of additional RAM speed and
you might want to spend more time with
that Ram frequency and that Ram voltage
setting pair
speaking of virtual machines there have
been previous platforms where it was
recommended to turn off things like
virtualization or execute disabled bit
not so we go into CPU configuration
where you can see all these settings
with Haswell because it doesn't seem to
be affecting overclocking at all which
is great because it means you can have
all these features enabled and get more
performance changing memory sub timings
can have an effect on overall system
stability as well as helping attain
higher RAM over clocks but honestly
that's a little bit outside the scope of
this guide one setting in here that you
might find really useful though is this
fastboot setting right here disabling
fastboot can improve memory
compatibility by giving the computer
more time to detect and diagnose any
kinds of issues as its booting up but it
will slow down your boot time now asus
has this setting on some auto rules in
fact a lot of this stuff is on auto
rules so you shouldn't need to touch
most of it but the CPU cache ratio is
something that once you've dialed in an
overclock and it's stable you might want
to try turning up because by default as
you increase the CPU the CPU cache ratio
might lag a little bit behind and for
optimal performance you want them to be
one to one so you might actually go in
and turn this up or turn it down to get
it as close to your CPU frequency as
possible keeping it 200 to 300 megahertz
below your CPU frequency however can
improve stability getting near the end
here guys now within the overclocking
tuner manual mode you can see we unlock
a few extra settings here CPU strap
allows you to manually set the strap
that the base clock runs out so changing
this to for example 125 would allow your
CPUs base clock to become 125 while
leaving all the other devices that rely
on the base clock such as the PCI
Express frequency to stay at their
nominal values this allows you to make
changes to base clock which mostly you
don't really need to do the only time
I'd really recommend changing base clock
would be to leave this guy at a hundred
and then make slight changes to the base
clock frequency like maybe on the order
of 0.3 or
point-five when you're at a setting
where you kind of look at your overclock
and you go oh I'm almost stable here
maybe I want to turn it down a little
bit under a hundred so that I can get
instead of four point four gigahertz or
four point five gigahertz I can run at
four point four three gigahertz to see
if I can get that little bit of extra
frequency that's how I'd really
recommend using these settings because
other than that you don't really need
them the last things I'm going to show
you guys are the CPU analog and digital
i/o voltages so these are these guys
right here now these can improve
stability but the challenge is that they
doesn't it doesn't necessarily mean you
increase them to get more stability it's
a matter of fine-tuning so if you're
looking for that extra a little bit you
might try turning them a little bit up
or a little bit down to see if you can
squeeze a few more megahertz out of your
CPU now on to the black magic of
overclocking itself I always recommend a
quick and dirty overclock to give you
some idea of what you're working with
before you start to dial things down so
for Haswell I'd recommend a multiplier
of 46 on all cores so we're going to go
ahead and change that value there press
ENTER to dial it in and I would
recommend a CPU voltage of 1.2 volts
press f10 to save the settings press
ENTER and this will give you some idea
so if it boots up and runs all the
benchmarks you need it to and all the
stability tests then you've got a pretty
good CPU congratulations if it boots up
and doesn't run the stability tests then
you've probably got something in the
middle of the road and if it doesn't
post it all doesn't get into the
operating system doesn't do anything
then that's unfortunate you've probably
got a below-average overclocker so this
is great our CPU is running our
stability tests no problems at 4.6 that
gives us two options now number one is
we can be happy with 4.6 gigahertz and
we can try turning the voltage down to
get better power consumption and less
heat output this will make the CPU last
for longer even though we're running a
pretty significant overclocked option
number two is keep pushing so increase
the multiplier and see if she runs at
4.7 gigahertz with 1.2 volts so that
would mean we'd have a pretty awesome
overclocking chip now don't worry if
your system isn't stable at these
settings there are other things you can
try you can see we're well within our
thermal threshold our target of about 85
degrees that keeps us below where the
CPU will throttle but is you know warm
enough that we're not super thrilled
with it good thing we're only going to
be running synthetics for a little while
remember real world applications won't
have the same heat effect on the CPU as
these synthetic benchmarks do so if it
doesn't run you can try increasing your
voltage in steps until it becomes stable
check that out we're stable at 4.7
gigahertz that means our CPUs probably
somewhere in the top 20% of Haswell
4770k s and we're feeling pretty good
about ourselves now we can keep pushing
but we know already having tried this
before we started filming that we're not
going to get 4.8 gigahertz without
pushing the voltage up further and we're
already sitting at about 80 degrees
under load on the CPU so that's the
comfort zone we set for ourselves if we
got more exotic cooling maybe we could
go a little bit further but we're
probably going to stay there what we can
do is we can try to optimize our
settings at this particular speed or
push for a little bit more but not quite
4.8 gigahertz now there are a few more
things to do now that you're pretty much
finished number one is turn up your RAM
frequency to the rated speed of your
memory or go up in increments until you
reach a point where it's not stable
anymore we were able to achieve 1866
even at 4.7 gigahertz number two is turn
up your cash ratio so what asus will
automatically do is turn it down a
little bit as you reach those higher
overclocks try bringing it up to one to
one you can eke out a little bit more
performance that way and last but not
least now that you've got everything
dialed in you're going to want to change
to that adaptive vcore setting which is
going to give you that best balance
between performance and power
consumption so you're pretty happy with
the overclock you've got there's still a
few more things you can do
number one is try playing around with
per core overclocking so while with all
four cores running at 4.7 gigahertz
this is the best we can do what if it'll
do 1 cor at 4.8 or 4.9 or even 5
gigahertz you can try tuning some of
those ones a little bit further to see
how they go next you can try increasing
the frequency of your memory so go up to
the rated speed of your memory and/or
maybe not the rated speed of your memory
go up one at a time until it gets
unstable and then back it back off and
that's pretty much where you're good to
go we got 1866 megahertz on our platform
even at 4.7 gigahertz next you can try
turning up your cash ratio to be equal
to your CPU multiplier this will achieve
a little bit better performance but not
that much the only one thing the only
reason we're doing this is we're
compensating for a Seuss's automatic
rules that turn it down a little bit
when you get to higher CPU frequencies
in order to improve stability it is
optimal to have them running one-to-one
and the last thing you do once you have
everything dialed in and you've run your
very last stability test is change that
voltage setting from manual to adaptive
mode that way you get the benefit of the
performance and the benefit we ran a few
different games and didn't see huge
differences going from our stock
performance CPU to our overclocked CPU
at 4.7 gigahertz
however we saw massive differences in
our benchmarks that really made use of
all of the cores of our CPU so the
examples were Cinebench and 7-zip where
our overclocked CPU performed up to 20
to 25 percent better than our stock CPU
giving you some idea of what kind of
tangible gains can be had in the right
applications with overclocking now if
all of that looked like way too much
work asus has easy profiles in the bios
where you can just go cpu level up 4.2
4.4 or 4.6 gigahertz and make it that
simple on yourself and within AI suite
there is an auto tuner that will not
just set a static profile but will
actually run through tests with your
computer and determine good settings for
your individual components and that one
takes anywhere from around half an hour
to an hour to run
pending on how long it needs to find
that optimal spot so thank you so much
