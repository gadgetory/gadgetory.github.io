to you by the Corsair 1 and synergy you
can check them both out at the link in
the video description
ok so Eve is this really small startup
that was founded to be like a disruptive
device maker with an emphasis on
community feedback to help them design
the best products for their community to
which I would normally go well gee you
guys taking community feedback is a
great way to get an awful lot of let's
say how about we call them c-minus ideas
but the v2 + 1 windows device that
they're showing off here at the show
demonstrates that they've got the
ability to filter through the guidance
they're getting from their users and
take out the best ideas because this is
looking pretty good every device has the
same basic specs so they've got a twelve
point three inch display running at a
twenty seven 36 by 1824 resolution and
what's more than that they've managed an
impressive 1,400 to 1 contrast ratio a
basically err gapless display design
10-point multi-touch and a 100% QC check
policy so every single device is going
to get calibrated right out of the
factory and the i/o is looking pretty
good too they've got to noise cancelling
microphones as well as speakers along
the top they've got two USB type a ports
a USB type-c port a fundable port and lo
and behold even a headphone amp Wow how
did they manage to do that in a device
in 2017 Wi-Fi is handled by an internal
2 by 2 AC wireless card and you can wake
the device with just one touch thanks to
the integrated fingerprint sensor in the
lock button every single one is going to
include their 1,024 pressure level and
two button pen as well as this Alcantara
cover that has a gorilla glass covered
trackpad as well as an RGB backlit
keyboard so pricing wise it's starting
at $7.99 which is pretty darn
competitive with the surface pro with a
coram 3 eight gigs of ram and
twenty-eight gig nvme SSD and it goes up
to well we don't quite know but probably
somewhere in the $1,500 range for a core
i7 16 gigs of ram and a 512 gig SSD
which when you put it up against the
surface pro is looking pretty impressive
like it's over $500 cheaper so how did
they do it I guess it comes back to the
whole collaborating with the community
idea
well they ended up with a little bit of
a thicker device but I like this
trade-off they get a massive 48 watt
hour battery and we're able to fit
full-size USB 3 ports on it pretty
freakin cool and there's other stuff too
the community said you know what don't
worry about spending a bunch of money on
the webcam we're not going to use it
that much and so they didn't till then
bottom line this is hardly a
comprehensive review of the device I
only got to spend about an hour with it
but I feel like there's still a lot to
say like it's shocking how price
competitive this small start-up has
managed to be with a massive company
like Microsoft and while the device is
actually not even available yet they're
going to be doing a run of them that
will be available for purchase sometime
in the summer I don't want to get ahead
of myself but I think if their goal is
to be kind of like a 1 plus of Windows
devices they are on a pretty good track
right now
so thanks for watching guys and thanks
