brought to you by D brand their grip
cases and prism screen protectors
protect your phone and really what else
do you need to know check them out at
the link in the video description we are
here in the delay lien where sweets are
restaurant or whatever this is it
doesn't matter the point is this is the
star of the show this is the Alienware
55 oled monitor technology preview don't
worry it's gonna have a much cooler name
when it comes out I promise you because
nothing could be less cool than that but
the product itself is something that we
have been wanting so much ever since we
first saw oled technology perfect blacks
fast pixel response times vibrant colors
nothing else is quite like it today the
fact that you don't have to deal with
zone backlighting in order to achieve
the kinds of crazy contrast ratios that
these things do because every individual
pixel emits its own light absolutely
incredible technology except for one
critical like game-breaking flaw del
actually released an OLED monitor it was
either last year or the year before
can't remember
they wouldn't seen it to me because they
didn't want me to review it as far as I
can tell anyway I just bought it and
then it broke in shipping and by the
time I could try to get a replacement it
was discontinued like dammit I just
wanted to get my hands on this thing so
apparently they learned their lesson
about going at this too early but this
time they're taking a more conservative
approach so they'll only tell us a
little bit about this it's using a 4k
panel it's 55 inches it's gonna run at
120 Hertz so that gives us some sort of
guesses as to who their supplier is LG
and what's really cool is we were
hanging out with LG Display yesterday
and they were actually showing us a
really impressive demo on what they've
been able to do with OLED pixel response
times over the last year so we could
expect because remember LG Display is
not the same company as LG Electronics
so we could expect that LG displays hard
work to make OLED better for gaming
could finally amount to a TV
okay they're calling it a monitor but
whatever - a TV gaming experience that
says low latency as you would want it to
be now there's a lot of stuff they
legitimately don't know about this yet
whether it's going to be compatible with
precinct whether it's going to be
compatible with g-sync
they do know that they're targeting some
kind of variable refresh rate gaming
technology but there are a ton of things
up in the air they know that it'll run
120 Hertz over DisplayPort but hey HDMI
2.1 is upon us
maybe it's gonna end up with a 2.1
compatible scaler and we could run 4k
120 Hertz over HDMI who knows the point
is they're taking their time we're not
expecting this anytime in the next six
months because they're doing some
long-term testing on burning prevention
to make sure they don't have a repeat of
last time so one thing that we do know
they're doing is they're not going to
crank the brightness the same way that
they did on the original m13 OLED gaming
laptop that thing was freaking cool but
of course any OLED is eventually going
to burn in its just due to the nature of
the organic light-emitting diode it
degrades so they're doing their best to
figure out what exactly it is they can
do OLED technology has also gotten more
resilient over time and I for one am
incredibly excited to see where we're
going with this so I think we're kind of
in the way but you know whatever yeah do
you mind hey thanks
can you hold that for me for a sec thank
you one moment so here from the back we
can get a better look at the cable
management system that they've built
into the monitor so they've got all the
inputs over there including a USB hub
they've got power over here the whole
thing comes down in a nice tidy little
ponytail there's no word on pricing
whatsoever but I mean hey whatever the
price is people are gonna buy this thing
because this is gonna be one unreal
gaming experience and I am pretty
excited and in other OLED gaming news
we've got the Alienware m15 OLED display
and did I just unplug it bloody hell
no it's fine it's all good yay now just
like pretty much every other gaming
laptop that we've seen here at the show
they have upgraded their lineup with
r-tx graphics so this particular one is
going to be available with an RT X 2060
or 2070 max-q
but unlike everything else we've seen it
is going to be equipped with a yes my
friends they still haven't learned their
lesson from the Alienware 13 r3 and OLED
panel now I shouldn't say haven't
learned their lesson because they say
they did and they've been hard at work
making sure that this thing isn't gonna
be a problem
but yes my friends it's coming back OLED
gaming and in a bigger chassis with a
bigger screen which was basically the
only issue that we had with the old
alien where 13 was we just wanted a
screen that was a touch bigger it's
still shockingly thin considering the
gaming power on tap and not just gaming
power this is equipped with a kora 989
50 HK which assuming that it doesn't
thermal throttle to hell and back no
guarantees we'll have to wait for the
full review means that you've got six
cores 12 threads of pretty impressive
power again in a pretty slim design
speaking of slim designs if you're
looking to protect your phone you can
use D brand D brands new prism screen
protectors are super thin they feel
really glassy but it's like kind of
incredible they've got this applicator
so you can put them on perfectly every
time and once they're on they offer
impact protection that I wouldn't have
thought possible
like I'm not recommending you do it but
this footage is real I'm taking a phone
and
a nail into a piece of wood with it I
peel off the screen protector which is
obviously dented to hell and the phone
screen is pristine it's absolutely
incredible
and they're also promoting their grip
cases so the grip is back and better
than ever it's got well the super grippy
design so you won't drop your phone it's
got the impact protection just in case
you do it's got their extra clicky
buttons and of course it's D brand so
you can customize the look with one of
their many true textured 3m vinyl skins
so check them out at the link in the
video description so thanks for watching
guys don't miss any of our CES 2019
