about the cinco-fone v2 is now available
in an all-new stunning sun-faded
beige-ish white that wait apparently
this video is the Samsung Galaxy s6 edge
I prep the wrong don't just stand there
roll the intro I need a minute
Intel's new 750 series SSDs utilize the
nvme standard providing speeds never
seen before on consumer storage drives
click this spot on the table now to
learn more so for my Galaxy s6 review I
had the option to go with the regular s6
or the premium
edge model with a curved display and I
went with the edge and the short sort of
spoiler alert' version of this video is
this the edge is objectively worse to
use than a normal flat display but I
really really liked it anyway and not
just because of the curved display there
is a lot to love about this device it
features bad aspects for great
performance and thanks in part to the
cutting edge 14 nanometer manufacturing
process Samsung is using to make their
CPU for it
it manages better battery life than its
predecessor in spite of the brighter
higher resolution screen and lower
capacity battery and it does so in style
the Galaxy s6 edge is the first Android
phone since the HTC One m7 that has
really stood out from the crowd and made
me sit up and pay attention to it and
while I have to acknowledge that many of
Samsung's Galaxy S series fans are going
to be super upset that they for went a
removable battery and microSD expansion
to make a fashion statement other than
the unfortunately fashionable these days
camera bump I do really love the look on
the back is the aforementioned camera
bump a single LED flash at a heart rate
sensor on the top is the IR emitter nano
SIM slot and a noise cancellation
microphone on the bottom is a grill for
the unfortunately positioned speaker a
three-and-a-half millimeter jack and a
micro USB charging port on the sides are
the thankfully like really everyone else
how hard is this raised for easy
operation without looking non opposing
and satisfyingly tactile volume and lock
buttons that thanks to the not
fundamentally broken design only get
pressed when I
and to press them then around at the
front are the 5 megapixel selfie camera
touch sensitive back and multitasking
buttons fingerprint reading home button
which friggin rocks by the way works
about as well as the one on the iPhone
six Bravo Samsung and the screen and
let's talk about that screen it is crazy
bananas bright like stupidly bright I
used the adaptive auto brightness and
found about 30% was good and while it's
not super amazing as far as motion blur
is concerned it's crazy sharp thanks to
its high contrast note that I didn't say
thanks to its 1440p resolution even
though it has that too because that's
basically irrelevant at 5.1 inches and
gone are the days of the super saturated
colors on Samsung's phones it's
beautiful with nothing overdone and
nothing to complain about unless a
little bit of color shift and less than
the droid turbo I loved so much by the
way really bothers you and unless you
don't like the curved sides yeah let's
talk about the edge part of the Galaxy
s6 edge shall we personally I love it
it's a super stupid gimmick with some
significant drawbacks like unavoidable
reflections when watching videos or
doing anything at all really lower than
normal glass yields in manufacturing and
they've got to compensate at the edges
for brightness so that they look uniform
from the front and brighter from the
sides for some reason that go completely
unanswered by any kind of usability
improvement but for some reason I love
it anyway I touched so many fancy
high-end gadgets that it takes something
really special to capture my attention
but from the moment I first held it the
galaxy s6 edge just made me want to
admire it like a stupid magpie it's a
stunningly beautiful device one that is
undeniably different from previous
Samsung phones and from their
competition and with the curved edges
Samsung has finally sold me on that
natural materials human touch or
whatever nonsense it was they were
pitching back with the s3 it's moved to
swipe on - it's smooth to swipe away
from and some things I was concerned
about like typing on letter
that sit at the edges were total
non-issue since only about half of the
curve has actual display area behind it
anyway but enough about that let's talk
about the camera the software is pretty
darn solid the dedicated buttons for
photo and video from one screen are a
nice thing to see and quick launching
with a DoubleTap of the home button is
great auto mode works perfectly 98% of
the time for me with lightning fast
shutter response auto focus auto white
balance and I mean well the mode is
called auto so I think you get the
picture and while the pro mode lacks any
kind of shutter control manual white
balance and the full range of ISO
options available in hardware it did
manage to be useful every once in a
while when I wanted manual control of
focus it's on the hardware side though
that the galaxy s6 really shines the 120
FPS 720p slo-mo is pretty unexceptional
but the seamless and not overdone HDR
implementation optical image
stabilization ability to use volume
buttons as shutter buttons tracking
autofocus and surprisingly good 4k
recording I don't know what it is but
some of the other phones I've used with
4k video recording including the Droid
turbo and Xperia z2 it just doesn't look
very good make it an absolute joy to use
is it as good as the iPhone 6 and 6
pluses camera well the in depth analysis
over at a non tech would seem to
indicate that in most situations no no
it is not but is that difference
noticeable to my eyes no can it finally
be said that for the first time ever an
Android phone is as good or like really
close almost as good pretty much across
the board yes it's a total pleasure to
use and in spite of some complaints I've
seen online and from other reviewers I
didn't mind the selfie camera with the
wide-angle lens and leg for real-time
effects making it pretty fun to play
with although I'm not really sure about
this beauty mode I mean if I add just a
little bit of beauty to myself it
smooths my skin and if I turn myself all
the way up to 8 out of 8 it removes my
pathetic patchy facial hair so that's
just insulting Samsung which leads us to
what is usually the out part of any
Samsung mobile device review the heel 2
galaxy's Achilles or whatever the only
thing more awkward than that sentence
Samsung's TouchWiz skin which shockingly
is actually totally fine on the s6 it's
still not perfect it makes pretty much
zero use of the edge with some clock or
something being pretty much it and it
doesn't have the same visual appeal as
the device running it but I mean that
was all I could really complain about
preloaded apps are very minimal
split-screen can be handy performance is
wicked lightning-fast obnoxious stock
sounds have been replaced by Pleasant if
a little generic sounding once the
old-people optimization of icon sizes
and high contrast colors all over the
place is now gone from the non easy mode
and there's even some good stuff I mean
why doesn't everyone have a cog next to
the volume adjustments for easy access
to all the rest of the volume sliders
and I love the easy configuration of
quick toggles and the ability to
schedule an SMS for someone within the
stock messaging app like I said it's not
perfect but man is it a big improvement
over the last time I use TouchWiz
although that was admittedly in the s4
days and I guess that's my general
conclusion for the phone itself it's not
perfect front-facing speakers might be
an ugly design decision but they really
improved the content consumption
experience and while I'm bitching about
things why on earth can't I reconfigure
the multitask and back buttons without
routing but in spite of those flaws the
galaxy s6 edge is beautiful and wicked
fast so much that I almost gave up my
3900 milliamp hour droid turbo battery
for it but not quite speaking of things
I can't give up on thanks for that
Segway Nick D brand skins you folks have
actually been looking at a D brand skin
for well however long this video was I'm
guessing about nine minutes nine and a
half
they're awesome skins they've got them
available for all types of devices

game controllers or whatever else the
case may be
they're designed to be a perfect fit for
your device and you guys have been
staring at an awful lot of macro footage
of this one so that should tell you
pretty much all you need to know they
come in many different looks textures
and colors for any style you want to
show
like carbon fiber which is my personal
favorite and why all of the devices that
I have with debrand skins tend to have
that on them they've got like matte
finishes metal looking stuff leather
true color they've even got a wood one
that actually looks pretty darn cool so
I think that's pretty much all there is
to say about bad guys check out the link
in the video description to check out D
brand if you want to get a cool sort of
vinyl wrap for your device here's the
one that's been on my iPhone 6 that was
kicked around on the floor at CES and is
still holding up just fine
and thanks to D brand for providing this
device for the review and supporting the
