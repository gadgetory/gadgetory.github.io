that I've ever unboxed but this one is
actually even cooler than the other one
so the original one I unboxed was the
original ruckus this my friends is the
rugged ruckus all-terrain powered
wireless sound system it slices it dices
it ok well doesn't do either of those
things but what it does do is it makes
noise in such a way that it is bound to
be pleasing to your ears and it is
ruggedized and splash proof so it can
actually be dropped from a height of 1
meter okay see that's how confident I am
it is splash proof to the i8 px4
standard which basically means that 5
minutes of splashing FRA with 10 liters
per minute of splashing will not damage
it from any direction with that said do
not submerge it splash proof is not the
same thing as waterproof and it's just
not really intended to be used that way
like the regular raucous booms
solar-powered so you can actually run it
for an unlimited amount of time as long
as the Sun does not disappear into the
cosmos away from us and because it has
an integrated battery it'll actually run
for eight hours without any sunlight so
if you were to take it inside where
there's no sunlight or if the Sun were
to go down on your particular party you
could keep partying for eight more hours
and if that's not enough for you then
well it does have an AC input as well so
check that out at the back you can orbit
I see okay yep
so at the back you can power it via an
adapter you can also yes USB out charge
your smartphone or other device which is
very very cool so that means that you
can actually not even worry about your
phone running out of battery while you
have the solar panel going because that
will power the speakers and charge your
phone and finally yes it also has an
auxiliary jack so it can be used not
only via bluetooth but also just by
plugging in directly on the front of the
unit you've got the basic controls which
are power bluetooth battery indicator
boom it comes with at least 75% battery
as well as volume up and volume down
and then right on the front of the unit
are pretty much the speaker so we will
be right back after a word from our
sponsors audible.com so guys if you're
not already familiar with audible.com
they're an Amazon company they have over
a hundred and fifty thousand audiobooks
available if you head over to
audible.com slash Linus what you can do
is you can sign up for a new account you
can get yourself a free audiobook which
you could do even if you didn't go to my
affiliate link but shame on you should
go to the affiliate link if you're
watching the video to get your free
audiobook anyway the point is out of
those hundred and fifty thousand books
there are at least five that matter and
they are the unabridged versions of the
Thrawn Trilogy as well as the hand of
Ron series of books so the original ones
heir to the Empire dark force rising and
the last command have been available
unabridged for quite a while now however
there's an extremely exciting upcoming
release and that is Spectre of the past
and vision of the future are both coming
in unabridged form very very soon so
guys if your Star Wars nerds and if
you're getting all excited about the new
rebooted movies that Disney is going to
be making over the next little bit and
if you're like secretly hoping for them
to tackle the whole Thrawn thing and cuz
that's awesome then you can go ahead and
geek out over the books and then even if
they don't you'll still have had the
audiobook experience so hopefully
that'll make you feel a little bit
better so you can head over to
audible.com slash Linus and get yourself
at least one of them for free and then
if you do decide to go for a membership
then you can listen to the rest of them
as well over the next little while so
moving right along let's pair this baby
up
and see how she sounds one thing I
forgot to mention before is the handy
carabiner loops right here so I guess
the idea for a device like this where is
rugged and splash proof and all that
stuff is you like clip it to the back of
your backpack and you like ride around
through the bush on your you know
mountain bike with it or whatever else
and for something like that it's very
very practical compared to the other
rough ruckus right that's what it's
called now the thing that isn't as good
as the other ruckus which makes sense is
the audio quality so it's able to get
about
about very loud so I'd say it's about as
loud as if someone was kind of like
yelling at you're pretty loud kind of
like that but it's not it's not as loud
and it's not as distortion-free as the
other one it does go louder than this
but you will experience some Distortion
so with that said is it good for what
its intended uses absolutely does the
solar power work absolutely in fact if
anything it charges a little bit more
reliably than the bigger one for me I
guess this would be to do with just you
know advancements in their
implementation I think that pretty much
covers it thank you for checking out my
