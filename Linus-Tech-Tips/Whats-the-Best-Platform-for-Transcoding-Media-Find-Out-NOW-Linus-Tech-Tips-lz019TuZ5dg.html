going to be a fascinating episode for
you guys so let's start with video okay
so videos everybody likes to watch
videos there's a few people these days
who own tablets there's a Motorola Xoom
or smartphones there's an iPhone 4 and
want to watch video on them but not all
these devices and not all the media
players are compatible with every kind
of media that you that you download or
rip or whatever however else you get
your media so you often have to a
transcode or convert the media from one
format to another so I'm gonna be using
media converter 7 for my testing today
this is actually a really cool little
piece of software it was 29.99 with a
coupon code that I found very easily on
their website ok so I'm going to be
using a 200 Meg it is a three minute
1080p file that was actually taken with
oh here you guys can see me this camera
the sx1 is10 ATP I'm gonna be outputting
it to an iPad compatible format and I'm
gonna be doing it on a number of
different platforms a number of
different ways so I have three platforms
I'm gonna use and I'm gonna be using
kind of a best stuff until 11:55 so
that's the z68 chipset with a 2600 K
hyper threaded processor that is the
most expensive platform out of what I'll
be using today I have an AMD AM 3
platform I have a crosshair for formula
with a 6 core 1100 T CPU bear in mind of
course that the motherboard doesn't
really have any impact on the
performance in this case it's a CPU
limited thing and finally I have AMD
socket fm1 so this is their new APU
socket so I've got a 38 50 quad-core apu
here on an a 75 MHz 55 motherboard I'm
gonna be using all the same hardware
across these different boards and
platforms so I'm gonna be using 8 gigs
of ddr3 memory I've got same power
supply and until 510 Series SSD on my
test platform then on each platform I'm
going to Inc transcode the video a
different way so I'm going to use the
CPU then I'm going to use a GTX 580 then
I'm going to use a Radeon 6970 and
finally I'm going to use the integrated
GPU and we're gonna compare how all
these solutions perform against each
other whether we're using
cpu CUDA Direct compute or in Intel 1155
s case virtue or the APU on AMD FM one
let's see how it goes ok so my first two
runs are done with the CPU as well as
with the GTX 580 using CUDA on the 1155
platform and the one that I'm about to
run and the reason I'm stopping to tell
you guys about it is with lucid virtu so
all I have to do is turn virtue on there
we go the processor graphics are now
enabled
although I am plugged into the dedicated
graphics card so the IGP
is working now and I'm gonna run it with
this one and see how it goes so I'll
share results with you as I go here and
as I discover what works better and what
doesn't so here's a bit of an update I
have the AMD FM one system running right
now so I got most of my results done for
that and I'm actually running it with
the 6970 right now so you can see that
the GTX 580 due to it's very high
performance actually outperforms the CPU
by itself which we expect I mean the CPU
was the slowest out of all of our
results even on the 11:55 platform where
it's a significantly faster CPU with
hyper-threading the IGP did beat the CPU
but not maybe not by as much as I would
like to see and actually here's
something interesting I also added on
the 11:55 platform I tested a gtx 550 to
see how it would compare to the 580 so
it's almost as slow as a cpu so and
definitely slower than the IGP so if
you're using 11:55 and a lower-end
graphics part well with anything but a
super high-end graphics card you may
actually be better off with with virtue
or using the CPU versus using CUDA so
here we go we've got our result for the
6970 so here it is it is 133 so you can
see the 69 70 once again doesn't perform
quite as well as the 580 but it's close
and then the IGP trails significantly
behind those two due to it well being
substantially slower so I'm pretty much
finished my data at this point only to
discover that
it was all pretty much for nothing so
what I accidentally did was I used a
video file this one which had already
been converted from its large high
bitrate self into a Windows Media Audio
files so what I'm gonna do second time
around is I'll be using this one this is
a one point six four gig file whereas
this is a two hundred mega file by
accident ok so this is a MOV file that
is what is natively recorded by my
camera then I'm going to convert this
into an iPad format so you can see the
data I've got here with the other file
so the Intel Quick Sync is a good
performer CUDA also performs quite well
OpenCL is a little bit behind CUDA and
CPU is invariably the slowest solution
however I just ran quick sync on the new
file which is the Intel Core i7 Extreme
Edition 990 X or maybe it's a nine ATX
unboxing and I was done in 56 seconds I
am now running it on OpenCL and you can
see the difference in performance
between quick sync and OpenCL on that
already transcoded once file this ran
and yeah 56 seconds and it's already
taken well over two minutes with OpenCL
when we're doing a far more complicated
file so I'm gonna just rerun everything
which is gonna take me a look at the
time it is now already which is gonna
take me another you know hour or hour
and a half or whatever and then I will
be back with proper results for you guys
okay well I'm finally done took me
another couple hours to finish up here
but I have the results so I've just used
my old chart but all of the bottom
results are the ones using the larger
file and converting it to an iPad
compatible format with media converter
seven so let's have a look at the chart
here and let's go we'll go through it
together so this is the 2600 Kay with
the CPU alone it clocks in at one minute
40 seconds which is better than the 1100
T better than the 38 50 and better than
the i3 2105 so that makes a lot of sense
because
is more expensive than this which is
more expensive than this which is almost
the same as this so this one you can see
due to its for course this is 2 cores
with hyper-threading this is 6 cores for
hyper-threaded course so this guy with
this four cores performs better than the
equivalently priced intel cpu with only
two cores alright now let's factor in
CUDA so we've got a GTX 580 now so they
actually all perform fairly similarly
this was a bit of a glitch but I ran it
again and I don't know why but the 1100
T did not perform quite as well with my
cuda GTX 580 as the the other cards did
with the 6950 we seem to see a lot more
benefit from additional CPU power so you
can see that the 6950 is still an
improvement over the CPU but it doesn't
skin like CUDA was very similar for it
with a GTX 580 across the board whereas
the 6970 it seems like if you have a
more powerful CPU to feed it it is
really able to ramp up the performance
so with the i3 2105 and clocked in at
246 with the 3850 226 209 with the 1110
of Wapping one minute 36 seconds with
the 2600 K now IGP performance so the
1155 to the 2600 K and the 2105 were
both within spitting distance of each
other and in spite of this being a
quad-core CPU that is clocked higher
this being a dual-core CPU so you can
see that the IGP is doing all the work
here it's not getting a whole lot of
help from the CPU side like we saw with
the 69 50 as for the FM one solution
remember unlike the Intel IGP with using
a lucid virtu on the FM one solution you
can only use it if you are running
onboard video this can be used if you're
using AC 68 or H 67 chipset there's my Z
68 board this can be used even if you
are running a discrete graphics card so
that's kind of a cool feature as well so
here you can see that the IGP did not
perform as well as the 69 70 but was
still better than the CPU on its own so
hopefully this was helpful thanks for
checking
my video on the different platforms and
their video transcoding performance
baron mao here's another quick thing to
bear in mind you guys so you can see
here that the with the age 67 or z 68
chips at the 11:55 chips whether it's an
i7 or an i3 just smoke everything else
but only a few software applications
actually support all of these different
hardware accelerations so if you're
using anything that doesn't in terms of
sheer CPU performance you can see that
the FM 13850 due to its additional
course blows away the equivalently
priced product from Intel and then you
have to spend quite a bit more to get
better performance on the Intel site
