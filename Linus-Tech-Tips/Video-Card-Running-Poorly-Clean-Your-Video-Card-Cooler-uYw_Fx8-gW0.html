cleanliness which okay so you guys
weren't gonna believe that's fine so
sometimes our stuff gets dirty and when
it does we always clean it up right away
which okay you weren't gonna buy that
either were you okay well how about this
one when our graphics cards get so caked
up with dust and gunk that gaming
performance and cooling suffers or they
get louder we finally break out the
cleaning supplies to restore them to
their original glory you still with me
all right so let's do that then
Intel's new 750 series SSDs utilized the
nvme standard providing speeds never
seen before on consumer storage drives
click right here to learn more so let's
start by introducing our graphics cards
I actually wanted to find ones that were
a little bit dirtier than this but my
cry for filthy graphics cards on Twitter
didn't yield any results that were any
better than the two old Bitcoin mining
cards that Terran had at his house so I
went with those of the to the 5870 with
the rear exhaust cooler seemed like the
better bet to demonstrate the usefulness
of cleaning out a graphics card since
its design causes there to be a small
difficult to access potential bottleneck
inside the shroud that can essentially
prevent air from getting through the
heatsink by contrast the 6870 has a very
open cooler design that is both
difficult to gunk up and easy to access
for cleaning so first step one we need
to get a baseline reading of how the
card is doing so we're gonna throw on
the latest drivers and use a gamer
application that puts a predictable load
on the graphics card so I used the
skybox in Crysis 3 right here and then
using an acai afterburner I was able to
load up the key performance metrics for
this test on screen GPU temperature and
fan speed percentage so we ended up with
values of 74 degrees at 39% fan speed at
max step two is going to be to take the
card off and then at a safe clutter-free
static-free workstation or at least
outside begin the cleaning process now
the easiest fastest way to clean out a
card is to use a duster can like this
and blow up the areas you can reach make
sure you hold the fan still so that it
doesn't over spin because that'll burn
out the header it's attached to and
don't turn the can upside down because
that's gonna blow residue junk all over
your card which could potentially harm
it in the long term with that done we
can throw it back on the bench and find
out if that actually did anything all
right so our duster can didn't make a
lick a dip
with peaks of 74 degrees and 39% fan
speed so that means one of two things
either the card is clean enough as it is
and required no cleaning in spite of its
grungy outward appearance or number two
we weren't able to get enough dust and
hair yes hair is a major concern for pet
owners out to make a difference so it's
time to step up our game remove the card
from the bench again and this time
you'll need a toolkit start by removing
the screws from the back of the card
being careful to label them for when you
inevitably put it back together make
sure when you're taking out the four
screws directly behind the GPU that you
remove them in a cross pattern to avoid
putting extra pressure on one side of
the fragile GPU die some coolers also
have screws in the rear PCI cover that
will prevent the cooler from being
removed so watch out for those with the
screws off you can pull the back plate
off the card if applicable then flip it
over and pull the cooler off the front
of the card then remove the fan
connector be careful not to lose or
dirty any of the thermal pads on the
bottom of the heatsink during this step
you will need them for reassembly and
they cannot be replaced with regular
thermal compound as you can see this
doesn't really give us any better access
than we already had to the inside of the
cooler and it's at this point that the
details of this how-to guide will differ
somewhat depending on which card you
happen to have so the next step is to
disassemble the cooler itself by pulling
out basically all the screws you can
find labeling them of course and then
popping it apart to reveal the heatsink
fins that are usually attached to some
kind of a solid copper or vapor chamber
base in modern cards we can see now that
our card falls into the former just not
that dirty in spite of its outward
appearance category of cards whose
cooling performance doesn't improve from
being blown out but since we're in here
we might as well take another run with
our blower can anyway reassembling the
card is as simple as doing everything
you just did in Reverse with one
addition
make sure you put some new thermal
compound on the GPU just a little bit
will do the trick and then with the card
reassembled we get our final results 73
degrees and 37% fan speed a marginal
improvement to be sure and one that's as
likely to be to do with replacing the
stock thermal compound as removing those
two baby dust bunnies that we did from
our cooler but that doesn't take
anything away from the instructional
value of this video so if your GPU is
running hotter than before try out this
guy before you junk it because
especially more modern cards can not
only run cooler and lasts longer but can
actually run faster
thanks to clock boosting technologies
that activate only when the card is
below a certain thermal and acoustic
threshold speaking of acoustic
thresholds do you hear that it sounds
like audible.com the leading provider of
audiobooks with more than 180,000
downloadable titles across all types of
literature including fiction nonfiction
both fiction and nonfiction wow that's
basically everything oh and also
