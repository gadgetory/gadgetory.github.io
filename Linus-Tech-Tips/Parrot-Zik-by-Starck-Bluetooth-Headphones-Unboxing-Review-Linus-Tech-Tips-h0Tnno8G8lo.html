that I'm extremely excited about this is
the parrot Zeek
and while I've unboxed a couple of
parrot things on this channel before I
have never looked at anything even
remotely like this so it's got a couple
seals one on the top one on the bottom
we're gonna break those and we're gonna
have a quick look at the overall
packaging so you can see they're going
with kind of a you know eco-friendly
recyclable cardboard packaging going on
here there's the story of Zeek which is
about when philippe starck and henry say
du decided to work together they made a
vision so apparently these were about
four years in development just to give
you guys some idea how long it takes to
bring a vision like that to life alright
the world's most advanced wireless
headphones I think this is pretty much
not open for debate at this point touch
control panel active noise cancellation
automatic activation by motion detector
their concert hall effect which allows
you to change a bunch of settings on
your phone look more on that later
Wireless audio streaming hands-free
calls simpler connection via NFC and
includes a USB charging cable
lithium-ion battery three-and-a-half
millimeter line in user guide and
protective pouch alright so let's go
ahead and see if it lives up to the hype
now I should tell you guys right off the
bat they are not cheap these are not
inexpensive headphones these are meant
to go up against the likes of headphones
like you know Beats or those kinds of
premium headphones although it almost
pains me to even utter Beats in the same
sentence as these because based on
everything I know about these so far and
based on my personal experience with
Beats they are not in the same league at
all I mean night I love you guys all I
really do like all of you who have Beats
but it really wasn't the best choice for
the money and as long as you know that
and you're comfortable with that then
it's okay alright so it comes just kind
of packed in here with some twist ties
and we're gonna go ahead
that I'm done I'm gonna start with the
accessories and then we'll get into the
headphones themselves which actually are
lighter than they look I've heard a few
complaints about them being kind of
heavy but I mean in spite of the metal
the metal construction here they
actually don't have too too much weight
so let's go ahead okay there's not much
else in here there's just this box right
here so we're gonna get everything else
aside now there's the Zeek themselves
and the accessory box so here's the USB
charging cable depending on where you
look the user reports are such that
you'll get anywhere from about you know
five to six hours of full functionality
playback time so that's when you're
using the concert hall effects that's
when you're using the active
noise-cancelling or whatever else you
you want to use so you do want to charge
this probably almost daily or every
other day it also includes a
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
jack cable so this one goes into the
bottom of this earphone there we go
and the other one goes that's a nice
look at that beefy cable and it's got a
nice braided sleeve on it so it's not
gonna snag on anything shouldn't tangle
up and this is extremely strong you'd
have a really hard time putting any and
undue strain on the connector of your
phone for example see if you were to put
it in there like that when it's in a
pocket it's a lot less likely to get
damaged than a straight connector so I
do like to see that the battery itself
is right here you can buy extra
batteries I think they're about thirty
bucks I'd love to see your higher
capacity battery at this time parent
says they have no plans to release an
external battery charger though so you
do have to charge the battery inside
your headphones so there's a manual
available in a variety of languages but
I think we're good without that and it
includes a soft carry case so sure that
people wouldn't have minded seeing a
hard carry case but at least it's a nice
soft material so you won't you know have
any scratches or damage or anything like
that now getting into the headphones
themselves so let's get all these
accessories out of the way the
construction feels extremely sturdy so
there's a couple things that stand out
so first is the synthetic leather band
on the top this is padded on the bottom
so you can see there's padding here I've
already had them on
the hair grease on there pretty hard on
the top it's quite flexible so this
allows it to sort of form to your head
whatever shape your head might happen to
be
and I actually find them quite
comfortable already but I'm sure with
with a break-in period I would either
discover that that's not the case or I
discover they're even more comfortable
than I suspected they are they do fold
flat for storage so you can see these
rotate 90 degrees just like that and
they actually go a little bit out past
90 degrees so a few ears are it kind of
you know wherever whatever shape
wherever they are on your head
they happen to be should line up with
them just fine that again I can't I
can't emphasize enough the construction
feels very solid so it's nice to have
metal implemented without it
contributing too much to the weight of
the headphones so you can see here that
even though there's a lot of Technology
and a lot of stuff going on in the ear
cups themselves they have a plastic
exterior well mostly there's metal here
as well and down here for the bass ports
so that's where your bass ports are it
doesn't end up too too heavy
now the ear cups themselves see they're
not huge by any stretch of the
imagination however my ears in
particular do fit inside quite
comfortably so they're soft cushioning
here on the inside between your ear and
the driver soft cushioning here in here
there's also extremely soft cushioning
here all the way around so they end up
very very comfortable if anything I'd
suggest maybe sort of for Zeke v2 maybe
a little bit more cushioning on the
bottom might not have been a bad idea
but I don't think it's the end of the
world either here so check this out so
they actually had to hollow out so you
can see there's a wire in there so they
had to hollow out the solid metal in
order to run the wires that are needed
between the left and the right ear cup
and yes so the difference is between the
left and the right ear cut so they're
meant to be worn like this oh right
adjustments check this out
extremely solid snapping adjustment so
what I found is that it really
contributes in a big way to having them
fit more comfortably and more securely
because when you have headphones that
are just kind of willy-nilly adjusting
them
all the time you're not gonna be able to
oh I did get them to move that time
you're not gonna be able to like really
shake your head and move them around
without having them kind of come off or
get weak over time it feels like an
incredibly strong mechanism and that's
one of the things that personally really
bothers me about cheaper earphones they
are earphones headphones they're also
extremely adjustable so I only had to
move them out a couple notches
I don't have a huge head by any stretch
of the imagination but you can see that
I'd be able to wear the Vivaan if I did
have quite a quite a large noggin there
so let's go ahead and get those back
sort of in place all right let's get
into some of the technology here so at
the bottom you can see on the left ear
cup there is a double microphone so the
huh the heads headset headphones depends
what you want to call them cuz it can be
used as a headset it has between four
and five microphones depending on who
you ask cuz there's a double microphone
and then there's some internal
microphones some of which are dedicated
to noise cancellation some of which are
dedicated to picking up on your voice
and these right here are jawbone sensors
so what they do is they detect movement
in your jaw it doesn't work the same way
as the the jawbone okay so it does work
differently from that but what they do
is they sit right here and they detect
when your jaws moving and using software
they allow the hardware inside the
headphones to detect vocals more clearly
than when you're than when your jaw is
not moving so connectors on the bottom
are pretty straightforward
there's your USB connector for charging
that is a micro USB again sort of not
really my favorite there's that
three-and-a-half millimeter jack and
there is your simple power button now
before we can power them on we will have
to of course
oh yeah should give you guys so here's
you know there's your little Philip
Starck philippe starck sorry my bad my
bad accents you got your little bit of
orange there a little bit of orange on
the inside of the connectors as well as
the the three and a half mil there you
go so powering it on is pretty
straightforward all you got to do is
pick up this look this your cup there we
go it's magnetic so it snaps into place
there you go easy to get out once you
figure out which one you're supposed to
be trying to get out
go ahead and throw the battery in here
thought we don't throw anything on tech
tips and once I figure out how to get
the battery in AHA there you go
works better when you do it the right
way now we can start getting into some
of the more advanced functionality let
me just get the app installed we're back
in just a moment
powering on the headphones is really
simple the power button it has a little
raised notch on it so it's really easy
to find then all you got to do my iPhone
4 doesn't support NFC but check it out
shows up almost instantly I mean parrots
experience is with Bluetooth I mean
that's where they were at before they
did the whole ar.drone things so I would
fully expect there to be no glitchyness
involved in any kind of pairing I mean
yeah NFC is cool but as long as it's as
simple as just finding the device and
just clicking on it then I don't expect
you know anyone wouldn't be able to do
that most of the advanced functionality
of the Zeek is controlled through
software so you actually can't change
anything you know what I should increase
my brain is here you can't in change
really change anything just on the
headphones themselves you have to use an
app so in this case we're using the iOS
version where we can monitor all kinds
of cool stuff so let's just go through
all of this in order oh there's another
thing okay and this this again is
nothing to do with my experience with
the Zeek I just want to disclaim that
right now but I've been using airdrome
v1 since it launched an AR Drone v2
since it launched parrot understands
software they understand the complexity
of providing proper software updates to
things and how that builds a customer
experience so that is why I would go for
something like this where really these
headphones are all about support and
software if they don't do it properly
then a lot of these cool effects we're
just going to do this later don't
necessarily even work now active noise
cancellation this does drain the battery
so it can be the difference between you
know five to six hours and you know a
lot more hours of battery life but but
they do sound better by all accounts
with active noise cancellation whether
you're using them in Wireless mode or in
Wired mode so just bear that in
and we can go into the system here where
we can oh okay active noise cancellation
during calls on and off Bluetooth Auto
connection enable or disable current
firmware available updates check that
out awesome
okay a Persian parrot concert hall this
this is cool so you can change two
different settings concert hall silent
room living room depending on how big of
an area you want to listen in you can
also change your speaker angle by just
sliding them around so you know the
interwebs seems to be an agreement
that's something around 120 degrees and
the living room in the silent room sound
really freaking sweet battery level is
well battery level there you go
batteries in use equalizer this is
another good one so again the interwebs
by and large seem to agree that Club is
a very good preset for it but unlike
some equalizers that I've seen you are
not stuck with whatever the manufacturer
decides you should be allowed to have
you can change it and use the user the
user configurable one as well and
finally help desks that doesn't really
seem to be much of anything so there you
go guys that's the app and one of the
most important things to note about it
is the fact that once you change any of
these settings that's done it's changed
it will be stored on the headphones
themselves so even if you carry them
over to some other phone that you happen
to use you dip D pair and repair to
something else no big deal it's all good
so now let's get into some of the cool
techy things that make people like me go
kind of crazy now the first time I tried
these headphones this is why I'm so
excited about this unboxing was at CES
last year yes this was like a year ago
at this point and I put them on in the
middle of a crowded CES Hall okay if you
guys have ever into CES you know it is
loud and I was like whoa 25 decibels of
noise cancellation that's what all those
microphones are doing for you plus the
fact that they are extremely well sealed
and well built to the point where I'm
having a hard time hearing my wife who's
helping me film when she tells me things
off camera because they are already
canceling a lot of the noise on their
own just completely passively and they
have active noise canceling as well now
other cool software features again I
wouldn't buy anything this software
reliant
believe it was going to be supported in
the long run tap here to play in paws
swipe forward to change the track swipe
back to change the track backwards and
volume can be adjusted by swiping down
or up which is really really cool and
last but not least you can actually
pause your music by going like this
because presumably you don't necessarily
want to listen to music while the
headphones are not seated on your ears
I've got to say I am really really
impressed I mean I was preparing myself
to be impressed I mean I was ready to be
impressed they're like $400 headphones
so they don't impress then come on so
just to give you guys some idea I mean
probably the best headphones I've ever
listened to or the HD 800 s from
Sennheiser I don't really like open
headphones that much is what I
discovered I spent a lot of time with my
HD 5 v 5s and then I switched over to a
closed set after discovering that
doesn't really work that well for me
these are outstanding with a person
standing less than a meter away from me
like I can see lips moving can't hear a
thing when all the features are enabled
it's running now one of the first things
my wife asked me and she's incredibly
fussy about headphones we found like one
pair ever that she'll have on her head
which is sennheiser pc 350s
and she says they're quite comfortable
the one thing for her was the bend at
the top so for me it's less of an issue
for her it's a problem and she said
these are phenomenally clear for
wireless headphones like just
unbelievable with Beats and any other
active noise-cancelling headphones I've
encountered in the past there's a
discernible hiss it's annoying I just
pause my music now I know there's a
discernible hiss there's no hiss if
anything the active noise cancellation
actually enhances the listening
experience on these now I just tried it
for four balls and yes in unpowered mode
with the three and a half mil Jack it is
not the same experience as when they're
powered however what I discovered is
that you can run them that like if you
were to just use them like at your
computer you can just plug them in for
power you can get a nice loooong micro
USB cable you could easily use them that
way and then
when you want to be unplugged you just
walk away
so you can charge them while you're
using them and I'm gonna have a really
hard time modulating the evolve you move
my voice right now because I can't hear
a word I'm saying so let's give it a sec
turns off it's extremely intuitive to
control them using the capacitive touch
interface here and what I do like about
the materials they're using is it's a
soft touch finish so you can see some
fingerprints and you can see that kind
of stuff going on here but you can
easily wipe them off and it doesn't
stand out nearly as much as glossy
surfaces which drive me personally
absolutely crazy and the music's back on
now so I'm a to note on you guys here
thanks for checking out this unboxing
and don't forget to subscribe to Linus
tech tips from our unboxings reviews and
other computer videos

Zeke this is not the first product I've
ever unboxed from parrot but he's really
loud welcome to my unboxing and first
look at the parent Zeke now this is not
the first time I've looked at a parent
product on my channel but I mean I guess
the same could have been said of but
welcome to my unboxing and first look at

first time I've had a welcome to my
unboxing and first look at the parrot
Zeke by Stark this isn't the first time
we've had a look at a parrot product on
this channel but this is a pretty
enormous departure from the stuff that
we've seen in the past so it's a couple
seals on the top and the bull welcome to
my unboxing and first look at the parrot
Zeke by Stark this isn't the first time
that we've had a look at a parent
product on this channel but this is an
enormous welcome to my unboxing and
first look at the parrot Zik by stark
this is not the first time we've had a
look at a parent product on this channel
welcome to an unboxing that I am
extremely excited about this is the
parrot Zeke this isn't the first product
I've ever looked at from parrot babies
over there but it is perhaps the one
that I am most excited about
