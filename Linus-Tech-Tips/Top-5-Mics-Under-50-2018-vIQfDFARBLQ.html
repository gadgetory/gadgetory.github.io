your groove
you got your Doritos and Mountain Dew
akimbo you're finally ready to break out
a silver and overwatch comp and then you
jump on comms and you're greeted by
keyboard clattering staticky garbage
from that one teammate with a
questionable user name and if that's you
don't fret because now is your time to
ascend to the crisp clean land of good
audio and for just about 50 bucks by the
way if you value good audio as much as
you value privacy you should check out
p.i a private Internet access is the VPN
that encrypts all of your Internet
traffic and uses a safe protected IP
it's got a ton of other useful features
as well check it out now at the link
below
okay so we were playing it up a little
bit most people don't have potato head
says these days but that's not to say
that there aren't tons of options that
straight up slap around even a decent
all-in-one gaming headset even if it
does boast high quality communication
and built-in premium noise canceling
features because as appealing as all of
that sounds in writing in the real world
appealing is probably the last word you
would use to describe the sounds coming
from something like this one but before
we get into the microphones it's
important to note that unless it's a
potato audio is highly subjective so
while I might choose one microphone over
another one my voice isn't yours my ears
aren't yours and it's ultimately up to
you to decide what sounds best so I
would highly recommend taking advantage
of return policies where necessary to
try out a couple of different mics to
find the best fit our first microphone
is the Samson meteorite coming in at 40
bucks a purchase that I actually
hesitated on since it completely lacks
any mounting options which means it'll
likely sit right beside your keyboard
other best cheap microphone ups featured
it though so we decided to give it a go
and my suspicions were immediately
confirmed it is literally just a ball
with a USB cable so unless you plan on
getting creative with your hot glue gun
it'll pick up every keyboard clacks desk
bump and a ton of other background noise
but wait it gets worse because of how
far the mic sits from your face you'll
have to pretty much crank the mic game
amplifying the issue so I'm not sure why
other people are recommending this thing
we don't let's move on to something a
little more enticing this is the thigh
fine K 669 USB microphone aside from its
excellent name it sports a nice brushed
pink exterior with physical game control
on the front unlike our
previous mistake and it comes with a
stent to keep the mic in a prime
position to capture noises from your
mouth hole rather than from your
keyboard platform but the most amazing
thing about this thing is the price it's
the least expensive microphone we tested
coming in at just 28 dollars less than
you might spend on loot boxes in a month
if you're one of those people overall
sound really good but it's a bit lacking
in the noise isolation department so you
might want to invest some of the money
you saved on a different mount to keep
it further away from your keyboard next
up we've got a mic from blue yes that
blue the one of yeti fame but this one
is significantly less expensive the
snowball ice comes in at 50 bucks or as
low as about $40 on sale and it includes
a little plastic tripod with standard
threading so that you can use the
snowball with a third-party stand
it's odd shape though can make it tricky
to shock mount without buying their
expensive first party solution as for
quality though the snowball is very
clear with solid noise isolation thanks
to its almost entirely foam padded
internals however if you have a soft
voice you might have some trouble with
it as the padding also seems to absorb
some of the incoming vocals it does work
to the advantage of us squeakers though
so uh I'm pretty much like in this one
pretty well it's pretty - I'm glad you
asked so we tried a few different XLR
setups based around Barringer's you
foria um two XLR interface at just
thirty bucks it might not be glamorous
but it's an awesome gateway drug into
the XL audio game on the cheap and we're
able to do it without using one of these
please don't use these now sadly since
it's basically impossible to stay under
fifty dollars without buying some stuff
used or already having a little bit on
hand this is a more premium option but
if you already have an XLR cable and a
micro
phone stand you can pick up the XM 8500
also from behringer for just 20 bucks
which would have you sitting right at
$50 this setup is basically a USB mic
killer in any environment thanks to the
excellent background noise suppression
that dynamic microphones have not to
mention that you can easily upgrade this
setup in the future with a mic like for
sure PG a 48 or SM 48 for 34 dollars and
forty three dollars respectively
so then what should you buy well if
you're looking for the best bang for
your buck it's hard to be the thigh fine
k-6 69s sleek design and excellent sound
quality at just twenty eight dollars but
if you're rocking Cherry MX blues in
your keyboard or if you're a buckling
spring aficionado I'd go with the blue
snowball or the behringer XLR setup as
they both give you exceptional noise
isolation just don't buy the meteorite
that thing is terrible I'd pick it up
you know I'm gonna pick it up taking it
out of the crater could get it cuz it's
a meteorite
speaking of meteorites ting does phone
plans not meteor anything you pay just
six dollars per phone line plus the
minutes messages and data that you
actually use every month with usage
shared across all of your devices so the
more phones on one ting account the less
you can end up paying per phone with an
average bill of just 23 dollars a month
per phone ting is the smarter choice for
mobile and they offer service on two
nationwide LTE networks so the phone you
already own will likely work with ting
there are no contracts and no overage
fees so you can't writing for a month
with no commitments whatsoever so check
out Linus ting comm to get 25 bucks off
your bill or towards a new phone so
