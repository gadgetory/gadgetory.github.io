Vengeance c70 I've received a lot of
requests to do a video about this
particular chassis and open so look at
that there we go okay so it's a case it
comes in a box
supports up six hard drive okay go ahead
but if the other side ah this is the
military green color so this case does
come in multiple colors and we are
getting the rugged its coolest equipped
us looking one with the military styling
now there's plenty of military sort of
themed components out there particularly
on the motherboard side like uses Tough
Series but we haven't really seen a case
that's really like military theme so I'm
kind of looking at motherboards like
that going ok well that's like that's a
cool if they're doing a complicated case
mod but how does this address the needs
of sort of Joe gamer who wants to you
know throw his PC and something that
looks like a Tamil box and go off to a
LAN with it now we have something that
makes sense
the c70 which uses hard foam which
doesn't thrill me but it arrived in one
piece
and it was airship as a single unit so
probably fine based on based on that
totally scientific test oh that's weird
the plastic is on upside down alright
it's kind of cool I was sort of
expecting the military green-themed
looking thing to be sort of cheesy but
it's actually not that's that's not bad
actually that's
cool you just get this plastic off here
and then we can start taking a closer
look at this new cage from Corsair comes
with a manual which you may or may not
need I mean their cases are so easy to
build in that it's rarely a factor so
I'm not too worried about that so
carrying em right here on the top let's
test them shall we if the case had
broken off I would have had a broken
foot in this case would be getting a
very poor review looks like we're good
so you can see these are attached very
securely six rivets and there's quite a
lot of overlap in the metal here and the
metal surrounding it these are just
plastic here so there they're not cold
they're reasonably comfortable to hold
on and they snap into place by all the
careful they don't find the catapult all
right
external impression so we've got dual
120 millimeter fan support in the top we
have little rubber grommets which are
going to keep the noise from being
terrible some full support for the H 100
so the spacing is right for dual
radiators which is a must these days any
case that doesn't support a dual
radiator and isn't like a silence
oriented cases probably like not as
great as cases that do 120 millimeter
fan in the back water cooling holes in
the back don't use these use an internal
water cooling setup since it supports it
just fine check this side one two three
four five six seven eight
PCI expansion slots bottom mounted power
supply and IO shield that is a great
color on this thing though I actually
really like the paint color they've gone
with here it's a very dark military
green as opposed to being a little bit
on the lighter side there's a fan filter
that you can also easily remove and
clean and there's actually another one
from the front so Corsair has learned
from their experience with the h-bar
with the 800 D where it had that really
long fan filter but by the time you like
put it on the floor next to your wall
you can't actually you know reach and
get it out because it's so long so
they've got an additional one from the
front so that the length is only half in
the in the back and
incorrectly so I need to make sure I get
that in there
bottom feet are rubberized fede things
that are going on here and oh let's see
high up let's look at the front oh
that's cool I haven't actually seen this
yet so power switch this red switch that
looks like that hard drive LED
headphones microphone two USB 3.0 ports
and the reset switch with a little cover
there it's adorable that's so cool okay
side window has a dual 120 or 140
millimeter mounting holes for case fans
and you can decide what you want to do
there won't be any radiator mounting
here though which wouldn't make sense
anyway hopefully you can see the can you
see the color okay in the camera looks
alright okay let's go ahead and take
side panels off so these are like ammo
box style side latches which again is a
very nice touch okay
inside Oh fully painted inside - look at
that see great attention to detail even
the parts that no one will ever see like
these little folds here everything is
totally painted very very nice coarser
kudos to you on that one
on the inside so we don't find anything
all that surprising this is a fairly
similar what he's apparently okay well
these fell out and chipping but that's
not the end of the world just go ahead
and slide this back in nothing
revolutionary in terms of the internal
layout this is very similar to the shoot
which one is this similar - reminds me
of the 550d actually
fools I'm like that yes very similar to
the 550d although there are some
differences so for example they've got
two 120 millimeter cooling fans here in
addition to space to mount additional
120 millimeter cooling fans in the front
of the chaps you protect this out and I
just pull off the front here at least
we're gonna try and pull off the front
you might have way to go slick that's
why they call him slick slick okay Oh
talk about that by blowing out the side
panel we get a little bit of extra room
for cable management on the other side
both side panels no and I don't remember
why I did that
oh yeah right so I could remove the
front oh here we go there we go so here
on the front you can see we can mount an
additional 2 by 120 millimeter fans
between this removable grill and I'm not
sure how to remove that but I'm sure
there's a way seems to be an arrow but I
really don't see how that helps us at
all um whatever if there's a grill and
two more 120 millimeter fan so what that
means is you can have excellent airflow
over your drive cages so you can
actually have a push-pull configuration
so even if you load this up with drives
and it's very very restrictive to
airflow you will have no problem
actually forcing air through that and
then towards your graphics cards or
other expansion cards and making sure
that they stay adequately cooled in
terms of the internal layout it's what
we've come to expect from Corsair huge
cable management holes which are going
to make your build extremely tidy
looking lots of included fans so 2/3 120
millimeter fans are included with the
case and then options to mount up to
another 1 2 3 4 5 either 120 or 145 side
panel six seven on the side panel that's
a lot of fans so it's definitely cooling
optimized your toolless optical drive
cages actually look very straightforward
so you just got a little latch here
there's two little nubbins on the inside
there that will latch into your dryer
just slide it in and then if you want
more security you can put additional
screws in here or on the other side
without any difficulty look at these
cable management clips outstanding
quartz air keeps coming up with new ways
to impress me and I'm pretty sure it's
me specifically that they're trying to
impress with every new cases we release
large CPU cut out large eight pin or a
dual a pinion or eight plus four pin cut
out large large kind of here for routing
things like the 24 pin over here routing
all these top ones see this is something
that no one ever figures out is like all
these top cables have to have a nice
direct path down to the motherboard this
is extremely tidy and lots of space so
you've got like an inch of space back
here wherever the motherboard tray has
recessed a little bit plus that
additional space from the side panel
being bowed out as well I think that
pretty much wraps it up so thank you for
checking out my unboxing and first look
at the Coursera c70 military-themed
doo-doo-doo that's not really a military
song-do there we go I didn't want to
finish the video that you guys having a
chance to look at it in all of its
splendor again thank you for watching my
unboxing and don't forget to subscribe
