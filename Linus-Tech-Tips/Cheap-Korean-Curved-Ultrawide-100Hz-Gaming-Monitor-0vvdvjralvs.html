coming into this video
that is to say I'm sick of ultra wide
monitors costing so much okay no but
seriously tell this company vo-tech
reached out to me offering to send their
34 inch LED curves monitor to have a
look at and initially I was just like
and it's another cheap Korean monitor
off eBay and then I was like right it's
a cheap Korean monitor off eBay that's
34 inch ultra wide and is anywhere from
four to five hundred dollars cheaper
than the ones that you can get from
brand names so is it up to snuff let's
find out
mass drop is now featuring their custom
configured AKG K 7x X audiophile
headphones check them and other drops
out at the link in the video description
alright so let's get this baby open so
honestly I wasn't even gonna look at
this
like I said in the intro but for more
reasons than just it's an ebay monitor
the reason that I didn't care was that I
thought it was pretty similar in spec
but just cheaper compared to any other
ultra-wide you could get what I didn't
realize until I looked a little closer
was it's 34 40 by 1440 34 inch ultra
wide at a hundred Hertz with free sync
for four hundred to five hundred dollars
less than what you would pay for either
an Acer predator or asus rog equivalent
at that size with g-sync
so you are definitely giving up the
tearing resistance of g-sync
and you are giving up the like a plus
panel or whatever it is that you would
get with a brand name but you're still
getting the ultra wide experience which
i personally think is amazing you're
still getting high refresh rate anything
above sixty is a very noticeable
improvement going past 100 to 120 I'd
say the gains start to drop off but up
to a hundred it makes a huge difference
and you're getting it at a way lower
price so inside the box we get a display
port cable we get a Korean power cable
with a North American adapter that's
been that's okay we get an arm arm in
there that kind of arm we get a foot we
get some screws and we get some
instructions entirely in Korean but
there are a few useful specs in here so
it's using a samsung v a panel that's
good to know it runs at 60 Hertz
according to this but it said a hundred
Hertz on the eBay page our 1800s
this is a very very curved monitor look
how happy that makes me so let's put
this baby together the foot bones
connected to the arm bone the screw
bones connected to the foot bone the arm
bones connected to the backbone the
backbones connected to the monitor bone
and we lift it all up and it goes a
little something like that
overall I gotta say I'm pretty impressed
I think they did a pretty good job
aesthetically for like an off-brand
monitor the bezels are pretty thin it
does get a little bit fat near the back
but I like the silver chin bar it's not
that big I like that it's made of metal
it's got like these screws on the bottom
that give it kind of like an industrial
kind of look
I wish the foot in the arm were not so
glossy and such fingerprint magnets if
you take such a heavy monitor like this
and you put it on a really tall arm as
soon as the user goes too tight you get
a lot of monitor wobble and that's
really not the case with this one
another polarizing bit is these little
covers at the back I personally am NOT a
fan because all they seem to really do
to me is force this wire to come out at
the bottom where you're gonna see it
from the front whereas if they were like
over here and they routed over here or
something I would see more of a
justification for them like you can't
really do that Ed likes them though so
that tells us everything we need to know
about Ed's taste the micro board monitor
is missing an audio output so if you
wanted to pass through to your
headphones you will not have that
capability but what it has is
DisplayPort 1.2 HDMI 2 and DVI of all
things so what I don't know yet is
exactly what resolutions and refresh
rates it's gonna run up for all of those
interfaces but darn it I'm gonna find
out so running off a GT X 1080 here 6950
at 128 gigs I ran it's a turning on the
on screen control buttons and placements
are not a strong point although from my
perspective you can actually use the
base as a mirror to see them Hey and it
turned on anyway there's no other way to
see any of the buttons no that's not
intentional I refuse to accept that that
was their intent okay so we've got it
fired up and I will say this any sort of
uncertainty with respect to the
specifications of the refresh rate we
can put that to rest because this is
clearly running out a hundred Hertz
let's go ahead and fire up a game well
if there was any doubt that it magically
had a g-sync module in it that tearing
should put that to rest but dang it
actually looks pretty good
Oh menus in Korean okay oh oh this
navigation is awful Oh what are the
buttons too sometimes you get what you
pay for
okay so free sync is included response
time is off usually the medium setting
is best I had noticed immediately that
motion blur was more than I'm accustomed
to in modern monitor so let's see if
that helped a little bit so motion blur
still definitely a thing even with the
higher refresh rate that's not going to
compensate for the pixels themselves not
switching that quickly and Samsung's MVA
technology is not known to be like the
fastest especially compared to things
like OLED or TN with that said and I've
said this before the higher refresh rate
makes a huge difference to the
responsiveness overall of the feel of
the game and I would take that over a
crisper 60 Hertz image any day of the
week so gaming experience actually
pretty solid um but one risk that you
take with these monitors is dead pixels
so we're gonna use dead pixel buddy and
have a quick look now the odds of them
sending a reviewer one that has a
bazillion dead pixels is obviously a
little
and actually I'm impressed
there are no dead pixels at all cool I
like that dead pixel buddy is just a
website now coming back to that hole the
10 bit mode thing there's a 10 bit test
ramp Photoshop file that you can get to
find out if your display is actually 10
bit and that looks like not but just
because the panel's not 10 bit and it
never promised to be saw is like who did
we get a little bonus
well we didn't doesn't mean it couldn't
be used for basic content creation this
on the other hand does these are about
the most all over the map results that
I've seen since I got my eye 1 Pro from
X right and this Kalman ultimate for
business software from Spectre Cal I
mean I look at these points some of them
aren't even in the same neighborhood as
the colors that they are supposed to be
hitting here ok so the last thing that's
left is to check out all the different
interfaces so I've never used an
ultra-wide with DVI before but there you
go dual link DVI 60 Hertz 34 40 by 1440
actually not bad I've never actually run
the numbers to see what we were gonna
get but I know that on HDMI 1.4 you've
been stuck with 50 Hertz on most ultra
wide monitors the good news though hdmi
2.0 seems to work perfectly so it just
switches on its own and boom there we
are 34 40 by 1440 i'm pretty sure we're
running out of hundred hertz and the UFO
test on blur busters will back me up
there so bottom line then I had edy play
some Counter Strike global Offensive and
his conclusion is pretty much this if
the option is between this and a faster
pixel response time display like the 144
Hertz TN that he has at home he'll take
the 144 Hertz TN but if the choice is
between spending another hundred dollars
to get 25 fewer Hertz somewhat more
accurate color actually did review this
display from Acer in the past and no
HDMI to
No then this one actually looks like a
pretty darn good option if you're only
planning to game and you don't plan to
do any serious color work because that
was not as compelling of a story ting
yes my friends that is the sound that is
made by the word that is the name of the
sponsor for today ting which I'm sure
you guys figured out by now
so ting is the mobile carrier that's
focused on customer service and
satisfaction when you call them you do
not get put through to a robot you speak
directly to a person and that follows
through to their billing policies as
well the average ting bill is only 23
bucks a month per device because you
only pay for what you use and if you're
stuck in a contract and switch to ting
they'll cover 25% of your cancellation
fee up to 75 bucks but how do you know
if it's worth of you to switch well you
use their savings calculator which we
have linked in the video description you
into your last few bills and it'll spit
out a number that goes hey you'll save
money on ting or hey actually maybe you
won't but there's a good chance you will
cuz data is now just 10 bucks per gig
beyond the first gigabyte so check it
out head over to Linus ENCOM and try out
their savings calculated today when you
use our link you'll get 25 bucks and
service credit or towards a new device
