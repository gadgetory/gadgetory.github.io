here and with it comes a bunch of mixed
reality stuff like paint 3d and the
mixed reality viewer along with some new
partner developed hardware to support
these mixed reality experiences and that
is what we're checking out today the
Acer Windows mixed reality headset is
the first of a wave of compatible
headsets all of which have similarly
brutal names but just what is so mixed
about it and at $400 can it compete with
incumbent VR heavyweights like the HTC
vive and oculus rift
the meteoric SAR series from Roseville
features a black exterior with white
interior accents a detachable five and a
quarter inch Bay and more check it out
at the link below okay first things
first
the ACE or Windows mixed reality headset
you know what I'm just gonna call it
Almer looks more like a mixed reality
play set it's glossy plastic finish can
best be described as power rangers esque
and its overall feel is less premium
than either the rift or the vibe I mean
nobody ever looks cool with clunky
headgear but this one is probably among
the uncoolest that I've seen yet and it
has some issues with fit as well
the padding around the goggles plugged
the nostrils of almost everyone in the
office who tried it and the headsets
sole adjustment point which to their
credit is super easy to use tightens the
headband without pulling the goggles
themselves closer to your face so it's
designed this way so that you can flip
the goggles up which is great for taking
a quick look at the real world or having
a conversation with a colleague but the
result is that the bottom edge of the
goggles is further from your face than
it needs to be making it difficult to
get everything perfectly in focus
let's talk screen now compared to the
rift and the vibe Almer uses a
significantly higher resolution screen
2880 by 1440 this results in a
noticeably sharper image and reduced
though still noticeable screen door
effect with that said don't get too
excited
unlike the rift in the vibe Almer uses
an LCD display instead of an OLED
display so even just wandering around in
virtual space there is noticeable
smearing behind even moderate speed
objects with the effect most noticeable
against contrasting backgrounds Elmer's
biggest claim to fame though is its
inside-out tracking so what this means
is that the system's awareness of its
decision is all done in the helmet
itself rather than having it rely on a
constellation of motion trackers placed
strategically around your desk
this means that set-up time a
significant pain point with other
solutions now takes just a couple of
minutes but this does come with some
drawbacks
if the controller's are moved beyond the
field of view of the front-facing
cameras they may glitch out for a second
while they recalibrate and well
traditional outside-in tracking will
always be more accurate especially if
you're using three or more satellites so
this combined with the LCD display
already disqualifies Armour for gamers
and probably high-level content creators
on the subject of the controller's let's
take a look at them you can actually
save a hundred bucks if you don't want
them but a lot of the experiences
definitely worked better with them
they're designed by Microsoft so you can
expect other upcoming mixed reality
headsets to use them and overall while
they won't win any organ Annika Ward's
your thumb rests sort of between the
trackpad in the joystick rather than on
either of them and the handles don't
taper toward the end for some reason the
build quality is okay and they're small
light and pretty simple to use I'm
actually genuinely a little annoyed
though that they use double-a batteries
rather than charging over USB that said
the fact that the windows home button
takes you to a literal Windows Home
definitely delights me ok then I'm glad
to hear you're delighted Linus but so
far all you've shown is a VR headset
isn't this the Acer Windows mixed
reality headset
how does Armour let you interact with
both the real world and the virtual
world at the same time haha that is a
long and wonderful question
it doesn't no no there's there's no
funny a punchline here
it just doesn't and I'll be honest with
you this confused us a little bit - in
fact truthfully I probably wouldn't have
requested one of these from a sir if I
had fully understood what it was or more
accurately what it wasn't so after some
digging it appears as though Windows
mixed reality is more like aspirational
branding for a platform that will
eventually support AR VR and M are tools
like the microsoft hololens then it is a
description of the actual products that
are labeled with it today so despite the
name headsets like this one are pretty
much last year's hardware with a high
resolution display on next year's
platform which makes it kind of hard to
understand why exactly someone would buy
them back in April when Acer first
announced this product pricing was gonna
be the big advantage but then oculus
hardcore used that Facebook money to
kill it when they slashed the price of
the rift which even includes headphones
and a bunch of games at the same price
of $400 so should anyone buy this thing
ok actually maybe inside out tracking
makes armor way more portable than other
flagship VR systems since there's no
satellites to cart around and then stick
on tripods and then plug in the wall and
then calibrate blah blah know it's
basically plug and play and there will
be lots to play the theater experience
is legitimately better thanks to the
intuitive navigation and higher pixel
density and by the end of the year wmr
will support steamvr so assuming your
gaming rig has the horses you'll be able
to play most of the same games as
everyone else with some tracking and
pixel response compromises
so all told Ben Albert isn't a terrible
product and for the person who needs
portability it or Samsung's upcoming
OLED competitor is a much better
experience than a phone based the Google
cardboard or whatever but for an
enthusiast like me I mean I was already
a little disappointed when it didn't
have the next-gen VR field that I would
have expected over a year after the
launch of the rift and the vibe and then
when it didn't even begin to deliver on
the promise that was right in the name
and didn't manage to undercut existing
offerings enough to be a budget
alternative I mean that was just the
cucumber icing on a gluten-free cake so
I'll be waiting to see what's coming
from oculus and HTC in the coming months
but before that happens I'll be telling
you guys about ting ting is the mobile
carrier that is focused on customer
satisfaction that's right if you're on
ting you can actually pick up your phone
which for some reason isn't in my pocket
I have this in my pocket here it is you
can pick up your phone and you will get
put through directly to a person and you
don't pay a premium for that kind of
service you actually pay only for what
you use both minutes and data and the
average ting bill is just 23 bucks a
month per device if you're stuck in a
contract and you switch to ting they'll
cover 25% of your cancellation fee up to
$75 and they've got lowered mobile data
rates mate it's just $10 per gig beyond
the first gig so head over to Linus
ENCOM try their savings calculator which
will tell you how much you'll save then
sign up at our link and you'll also get
25 bucks in service credit or towards a
shiny new device so thanks for watching
guys if this video sucked you know what
to do but if it was awesome get
subscribed hit that like button or check
out the link to where to buy the stuff
we featured in the video description
also linked down there is our merch
store which has cool shirts like this
one and our community forum which you
should totally join</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
