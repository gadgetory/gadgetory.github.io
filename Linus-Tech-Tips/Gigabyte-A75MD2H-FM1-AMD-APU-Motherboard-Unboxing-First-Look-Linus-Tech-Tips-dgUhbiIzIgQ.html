with 3 year warranty and ultra durable 2
and DX DX I won no actually that's
DirectX 11 so here we go what's super 4
about it super safe ok super speed
ok super savings ok and super sound we
have this is an fm1 socket motherboard
with the a75 chipset which does support
AMD's apu products okay we've got there
three three three onboard acceleration
which means USB 3.0 SATA 3 6 gigabit per
second as well as USB power 3 which
means if you plug into a hub you have
three times the available power the
standard USB port uses all 50000 our
japanese solid caps and let's go ahead
and see what it has to say for herself
on the back 108 decibels sound to noise
ratio very very cool stuff lower RDS
MOSFETs one fuse per USB for it oh cool
so no matter what happens you will guard
against system malfunction or sure
system longevity because you won't cause
like shorts and stuff cool ok let's not
find a user's manual with the DVD that
you should throw away and download the
latest from the gigabyte website we will
find an i/o shield that you can throw
away and download the latest from the
gigabyte what no I'm just kidding y'all
ha you'll need that we've got 2 SATA
ports apart SATA ports SATA cables one
is the right angle one is a straight
cable they're blue next we have a
multilingual installation guidebook and
two more SATA cables there blue one more
straight one more right angle finally we
have the motherboard itself which is
also blue and matches the blue cables ok
goodbye
putting so much thought into like color
scheme these days I'm proud of them
alright so let's have a look at the
layout of this FM one board now this
looks like an AM tour at a three-word
but it's not FM one means that you have
full support for an APU that is onboard
video that is right on the chip itself
the CPU the APU the thing that goes here
the main guy ok so that means that you
have support for up to 2560 by 1600
resolution output by DDI you have
support for VGA as well as HDMI all
running in DirectX 11 off the CPU and it
is powerful enough to even run games
like dirt 3 very cool
you've got your 4 pin power connector up
here in the top left and it's ideal
location you've got whatever camera man
is looking at how DirectX 11 traded okay
we've got the CPU socket in its
similarly ideal location remember at
them 1 even though the bracket looks a
little different does support the same
coolers as a m2 and aims three CPU fan
header is here we have dual channel
memory support right about over here and
our 24-pin power connectors in its ideal
location along the right hand edge of
the board this is a new one your front
panel connectors are over here on the
right-hand edge of the board I haven't
seen that before but it makes as much
sense as any other place to put them
moving down we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 this a 2
3 6 gave it per second ports those are
running off the AMD chipset so that is
not a third-party chipset and next we
have front USB 3 look at that on a value
board front USB 3 with a header very
very nice there's a front USB 2 port and
with that red background in the back you
know that's the one that's suitable for
charging higher powered devices ok and
front audio we have look at this we've
got dual PCI Express 16x physical slots
but only this one is actually suitable
for 16x mode this guy right here is
actually a 4x electrical slot you can
tell from the pins that are inside the
slot we have a PCI you want ex lot and a
PCI slot for your legacy expansion
because if you're running a board like
this it's quite likely you'll have
legacy expansion cards like maybe a
sound card or a LAN card whatever the
case may be on the back of the board we
find a ps2 mouse keyboard combo port two
USB ports a wow I'm at a loss optical
audio out USB 3.0 ports times 2 have
come another couple of USB 2 ports so
that's a total of 4 USB to ports and 2
USB 3 ports Gigabit Ethernet and 5.1
audio out thank you for their hangout my
unboxing at the a 75m d2h and don't
