Drive it's pretty good it served me well
for three years however there's a new
kid on the block the survivor stealth
takes everything that was good about the
original survivor and kicks it up a
notch
the anodized aluminum housing looks
stunning in a military-style matte black
and the molded shot collars have been
significantly thickened for better
durability the keyring has also been
upgraded to make it less likely to wear
out over time once we open up the drive
we find the USB 3 SuperSpeed interface
and activity LED and the EPDM seal that
makes this drive waterproof to up to 200
meters deep
overall the housing is incredibly rugged
and can handle up to 400 G's of impact
impact ratings are fascinating but
unless you actually test them they're
totally meaningless
impact tests are great but we also
wanted to evaluate just how waterproof
the survivor stealth is the answer very
waterproof and no matter what your
drives been through see this is the one
we did our throwing tests on it is still
ideal for covert ops where you don't
want to get recognized so you've got to
get in and out in a hurry
so we're using the USB 3 transfer speeds
in order to copy a 1 gig file of what
you can see is clearly secret stuff off
of a laptop now the drive will work in
USB 2 mode however it will just copy
slower so it's fully backwards
compatible you just won't get the
benefit of super speed USB 3 so you can
see we're copying at over 50 megabytes
per second and we are out of here this
has been another tech quickie on the
corsair survivor stealth I'm Linus and I
hope to see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
