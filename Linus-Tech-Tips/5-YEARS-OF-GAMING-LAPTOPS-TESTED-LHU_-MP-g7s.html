gadget or Y most expensive tech there's
a huge influx of comments asking us to
do a build guide for a super budget
system or like a cheap laptop roundup
and typically I respond with no that's
boring but today today is a different
day we're gonna be looking at the
evolution of the thousand dish gaming
laptop over the last five years and if
you enjoy it quietly without any
complaining origins gonna give away an
eon 15's at the end ok ok
before we begin let's set the scene each
of our five laptops some of which were
actually kind of difficult to obtain was
priced at a thousand ish dollars when it
was new and has what we would consider
typical
notebook graphics for the time we have
representatives from five Intel
architectures Sandy Bridge Ivy Bridge
has well skylake and finally KB Lake in
the currently shipping origin PC on 15's
starting on the outside build quality at
this price hasn't really changed much
almost all of our competitors share a
decent build typically sporting a hybrid
plastic and metal finish on the exterior
deck flex is basically non-existent
since the thin and light gaming machines
that suffer from this are usually much
more expensive and both screen flex and
typing induced screen wobble were
acceptable safe for the lenovo y 5 10 P
whose screens front glossy plastic is
reminiscent of a $300 Best Buy special
I'm really glad that whole thing went
out of fashion
speaking of casings we've actually done
not too bad in that department our three
newest pcs all have almost entirely
black exteriors aside from some red
accents while the Sandy Bridge and Ivy
Bridge models are just about the
furthest thing from a gamer aesthetic
that you can get it's safe to say that I
wouldn't shy away from taking any of
these into a business meeting again the
more out there gamer e aesthetic seems
to dominate the higher end gaming skews
on two screens then my eyes have become
so accustomed to IPS and high-end TN
panels that these older budget offerings
induced what I call a splitting first
world problem headache every laptop we
tested features I mean I guess features
is kind of a strong word here a TN gorbo
Edition screen with the exception of the
EON 15s to be clear that one isn't the
most amazing panel in the world but the
falling costs of IPs displays overall
has driven a huge improvement
industry-wide in the day to day
usability of value laptops gaming and
otherwise and full HD 1080p resolution
is a nice touch
what a wonderful segue who could forget
about gaming laptops and their
historically completely gross tastic
touch pads we actually sort of lucked
out on this one every unit we tested has
what I would describe as a decent
trackpad it's no MacBook or razor blade
but none of them are at that
deal-breaker level connectivity is
pretty strong throughout especially as
we get newer and newer the HP EliteBook
we picked up even has a full-size
DisplayPort connector on the side along
with eSATA so that was kind of weird and
USB 3 first enters the spotlight with
Haswell and thank goodness for that
I was even a little surprised to find
that not only the EON 15s but also the
MSI GL 62 have USB type-c as well not to
mention that every one of them has an
Ethernet port it's it's actually kind of
funny to see how the trends that I spend
so much time complaining about like the
reduction in IO on computers aren't
really affecting this segment battery
life isn't really accurately measurable
on used laptops due to degradation but
we ran PC markets battery life test
anyway it simulates a light office
workload and to represent an average
battery saving set up the brightness was
set to 50% and power profile - battery
saving mode the results were mostly
unsurprising although origen Xeon 15s
scored a pretty respectable almost 4
hours I guess that's where the power
efficiency of each new CPU generation
comes in but none of that is really the
point of our investigation these are
gaming laptops after all you didn't
think we were gonna forget about
benchmarks did you silly goose 4 games
we chose one game from each year
starting with when our first laptop was
released 2012 so we loaded up
Borderlands 2 bioshock infinite dragon
aging
position rise of the Tomb Raider deus ex
and Ghost Recon wildlands on each laptop
performance in this sector has for a
long time been underwhelming kind of
like no man sky except more like no
man's framerate even in the older titles
like Borderlands 2 at medium settings
the older laptops barely cracked the 30
FPS barrier that is until you get to the
modern origin yawn 15s this thing
completely wipes the floor with the
other systems and for good reason
previous iterations of value gaming
laptops often used mobile variants of
contemporary GPUs like the MSI with a GT
940m X and the y 510 p with a 755 m
these M GPUs from my personal experience
were less likely to get driver updates
and more likely to cause system
stability issues and crashes even when
they did have enough power
by contrast current gaming laptops like
our Origin PC system have full fat
desktop graphics cards in this case a
1050 Ti that spec to pull a whopping 70
watts at load with all the long-term
support that comes with a more
streamlined product lineup so it
basically comes down to this battery
capacities haven't changed much and
neither has build quality from our
samples but creature comforts like
displays have improved by leaps and
bounds and as for graphics cards both
performance and reliability have
improved dramatically while on the CPU
side power consumption especially during
basic workloads has improved to such a
degree that it's no longer true that a
gaming laptop has to be unsuitable for
other tasks so hopefully you guys stuck
around because like I said before Origin
PC is giving away one of these bad boys
