so maybe possibly hopefully yeah maybe
possibly hopefully we certainly we
certainly think so I will jump into the
twitch chat all right so welcome to the
windchill guys the weekly stream that
happens every week come hell or high
water no matter what even if we have
already been streaming for almost a
continuous 24 hours prior to the show
which is what's been going on so I think
we best open with a brief introduction
or a brief explanation of what the heck
is going on and where we actually are
for those of you who don't know we have
been live streaming and videos mod twist
or mod 24 which was on a 24 hour
celebration of PC modding and Penske
gaming I know for a fact NVIDIA invested
a lot of money into oh you've got to be
kidding me the dashboard should not have
ads all right maybe Amazon will get that
face alright so we've been down here for
in videos mod 20 for a 24 hour
celebration of PC gaming and PC modding
they invested a lot of money into the
event and they asked us to to come down
and host the PC case modding competition
there were a lot of really famous PC
case motors including dart Beavis and
someone that I've known for like eight
years talking to along forums I think
this is the first time we've ever
actually met in person which was really
cool funnily enough his rig isn't behind
us but we do have the winning rig behind
us which was I think the story that went
along with it was really cool was really
really special had to do with their
their favorite land one of their
favorite and video employees who who
used to come down to that land and
people are saying I look exhausted guys
I wonder why I wonder why I have hardly
slept in the last few days here
but don't don't worry we are gonna make
it through this show in spite of the
fact that neither Luke nor I has
actually really looked at the the stream
document so we're gonna pick some
highlighted topics for this week first
up is of course the launch of the GTX
980 and GTX 970 that is one of the
reasons that we are down here in
California right now and we have a video
up for the 980 and I think we're gonna
be getting a video up hopefully next
week yeah you're gonna hit the 970 and I
don't know if this is official or not
but I kind of leaked it a little bit
that we might be doing some oh we will
definitely be doing some SLI testing so
the next big thing that happened this
week Microsoft officially acquires
Mojang so for those of you who don't
know Mojang is the maker of the infamous
minecraft so what microsoft plans to do
with minecraft
I think people either don't know or
don't want to know yeah or somewhere in
between
yep and then there was something really
interesting somewhere no all right apple
has updated their security on the iPhone
on iOS to such that if your phone is
locked even they cannot access your data
which I guess is their way of absolving
themselves and any responsibility to
report any of their user's data to the
government in such a situation as that
would be requested of them so I kind of
give them massive massive kudos for that
with that said the release of iOS 8
doesn't seem to have created a whole ton
of fanfare amidst the community so it
seems to be a lot of under the hood
improvements without a ton of you know
huge graphical changes like we saw in
iOS 7 so why don't we call that our main
topics roll the intro and that's cool
and get this show on the road yeah
you
you can sign up at squarespace.com slash
Linus and use offer code Linus to save
10% on your own beautiful customizable
website so we have only got let's see 75
minutes of battery so we're gonna have
to kind of fly through our topics today
and and do our best to to cover them as
well as we can especially given we have
no idea what we're talking about so four
gtx 980 which is actually our first
topic you can check out our youtube
video so we can fly past this one pretty
quick and also the GTX 970 launched
we'll be having a video coming next week
so I don't think we need to talk a ton
about these individuals well they are
kind of important they are kind of
important things - should we talk about
them yeah I think I think it may not be
it may not be a terrible idea
so in our performance testing in the
YouTube video we found that 980 and 780
Ti go pretty toe-to-toe in a lot of
different situations but then 980
crushes 780 I in power yeah so the the
to be clear guys when you look at any
other review on the web you're gonna
find you're gonna find 980 pretty much
dominating everything else but the key
difference is that we overclock all of
our cards as far as we possibly can
before running all of our benchmarks so
what we found is that while 980 is a
beast overclock I think there was only
one game that wasn't running over 1500
megahertz on the core just like really
yeah you serious bro our 780ti is also a
bit of a beast and runs well over 1200
megahertz
- so given the number of CUDA cores
given the 384 bit memory bus that 780 Ti
has a lot of raw horsepower to throw at
any kind of a any kind of a rendering
problem so we ended up with them kind of
trading blows the one that I'm actually
really interested in Annie so kind of a
funny story why we didn't end up with a
GTX 970 in time for us to do a review
for launch I was sitting in the briefing
down in in California which is where I
am now so here I was sitting I was
sitting in the briefing very close to
where I am right now and I got an email
from gigabyte yo dawg here's a graphics
card codename
something and I wasn't looking that
closely at it because I was in the
middle of a presentation I do you want
us to send you a sample for a review and
I kinda went yeah sure and I figured
because NVIDIA was only seating GTX 980
s I figured that gigabyte was sending us
a 970 turns out that the one that
arrived from gigabyte is a 980 so we
actually ended up with 299 ATS and no
970 s at all so I asked a good bite
about it I said hey do you guys have a
970 that we can get our hands on we
haven't we haven't been able to do a
review yet and they said oh well we
actually prioritized you to get a 980
because you're a key partner for us I
kind of went oh thank you it didn't work
out very well for anyone but appreciate
it yeah I appreciate the thought you
guys you guys were awesome we love
working with you and all that stuff I
just really wish we have a 970 so we can
do our review so that's why that's not
out this week but that'll be next week
yeah we'll get that up but I'm really
interested in that one because the
pricing is so aggressive as low as three
hundred and thirty bucks in the u.s. for
our card that is effectively around 20%
slower than the GTX 980 because they cut
down some of the functional units and I
I don't actually know you're at the
event but I'm assuming it also has auto
balancing power rails no no no sorry
that is still a top tier I know that's
still a top tier only feature so 780ti
GTX 980 are the only ones that have that
auto balancing power feature that makes
overclocking on these cards pretty
flexible yeah and pretty beastly yeah
yeah yeah I see that'll be interesting
because it'd be completely different
overclocking experience of the new
platform so the O P here is good bytes
what I'm gonna do this week is I'm just
gonna kind of spam twitch chat because I
didn't think to bring oh you have got to
be kidding me I didn't think to bring
two oh wait what oh here we go here we
go I got this I got this
I didn't think to bring to capture
devices here so we've just got the one
for our camera so I can't actually
screen share with you guys but what I'm
gonna do is I'm going to spam chat with
the links to the Articles that we're
talking about so the original posters
let me manage the shared space the
original poster was good bytes and
basically Mike
soft has revealed a fair number of
details about DirectX 11.3 and DirectX
12 now we've got a lot of information in
the doc that hopefully Luke is reading
right now so he can talk about this a
little bit but in a nutshell we actually
had the DirectX project lead presenting
at the Nvidia pressed event last week
and in a nutshell he basically said okay
well we'll look here here's what it is
DirectX 11 point three is the features
so it's got the new rendering features
that are really exciting and are going
to potentially free up overhead from the
GPUs make it so that they can more
efficiently render things like multiple
transparent objects so they showed off
yeah rasterizer ordered views thank you
so you showed off a few different things
that DirectX 11 points we can do and
then explain that DirectX 12 is
basically going to have those features
except with all that CPU performance
optimization that we've been hearing
about ever since
AMD first started talking about mantle
and how it was going to allow your CPU
to your multi-core CPU to spread out
workloads much more effectively now the
funny thing about DirectX 12 is that not
only have they made it so that they're
going to be able to split the workload
across CPUs but in the slides that he
showed us something really interesting
that we noticed is CPU usage overall
also plummets so while the theory that
like the theory that I've had up until
up until he gave us that presentation
was that all of a sudden we're gonna
have this yeah we're gonna have a
justification for for you know gtx 59 60
X just for straight gaming and games are
gonna be able to leverage that I kind of
will hold on a second gtx 59 60 did I
say that core i7 59 60 actually you so I
it's just running one game I was like
okay yeah maybe we'll be able to use all
eight of these cores and all 16 of these
threads but then I kind of realized well
hold on a second if CPU utilization is
going down this much we might just not
need the cores or the clock speed it'll
be
really interesting to see what happens
to what we need in terms of CPU power
for gaming I mean what I'd really like
to see happen is I'd like to see game
developers use the CPU horsepower that
we have anyway AI destructible
environments I don't know how CPU
intensive it is but nvidia z' new global
illumination feature yeah i would love
to see some of that offloaded to the cpu
so that we can get truly much more
dynamic visually games in the next
couple of years here it might take us a
little bit to see some of these
implementations because there's a few
warnings it says it's very powerful but
it's difficult to master and quote
unquote dangerous and inexperienced in
the hands of inexperienced programmers
they're saying that the development
model is that a few code gurus will make
stuff like engines and platforms that
other people can build on top of and
outside of that they don't really expect
too many people to touch it because it
will be a very very complicated thing to
work with all right so our next our next
topic is engineers made a radio the size
of an ant that doesn't require a battery
this was originally posted by ET RJ on
the Linus tech tips form and the
original article is from the verge comm
so engineering professors from Stanford
and the University of California
Berkeley I don't know I don't know how
that sentence was supposed to be anyway
created the radial the size of a net no
battery it's actually powered by
harvesting radio signals and doesn't
require any external power so the goal
is to use these chips to facilitate the
internet of things so for those of you
who aren't familiar with the term
Internet of Things it it refers to the
concept that everything will be
connected so not just your SmartWatch
not just your smartphone but even
something as simple as your headphones
and and high quality headphones not
headphones we're having connectivity in
them is just this janky clergy a
gimmicky type of feature just everything
will have connectivity because it will
be so cheap to implement and so easy to
end
and that even good products we'll just
we'll just have it so something as
simple as you know your power adapter
for your notebook could be connected
there's no reason why it couldn't be and
that could feed into your house and tell
your house how much power it's consuming
and the house could you know
automatically balance power who knows
like the idea is just that once
everything's connected we're gonna
unlock a lot of possibilities that we
didn't have before things like doorknobs
things like your car door so just being
able to carry your smartphone in your
pocket and have everything in your life
be connected so obviously we're not
there yet no I mean you look you just
you can look at something like the Moto
360 as a great example of how yeah this
type of technology is not cheap or power
efficient enough yet for ubiquity mind
you are the problem is because they used
like a who's a processor from 2010 you
have to assume that they did that for
cost reasons there's there's a lot of
there's actually a lot of different
reviews out there talking about how it
doesn't really seem to be much of a
sensible reason because there's actually
cheaper chips that would have been
better yeah I don't know maybe they got
like a massive bulk order for of it for
some likes ridiculously cheap price or
something
I don't even that doesn't really make
any sense because I mean the the release
cadence for mobile products tends to be
about a year and so I wouldn't expect
Motorola to be refreshing the Moto 360
for probably about a year so it's not
like you order a year's worth of CPUs
every that doesn't make any sense it's
just it's it seems so silly like I just
I don't understand why they did that and
I was so excited to get at most 360 and
I'm so happy that I've taken to never
pre-ordering things yeah yeah because
holy crap anymore
so anyway these these new chips that are
powered by by harvesting radio signals
are only supposed to cost a few cents to
produce so that could make it possible
to integrate them in these types of
commodity items things like things like
light bulbs things they're just all over
your house and
and the kind of information they could
provide could be pretty cool I mean not
just being able to tell you okay how
much power the lightbulb is consuming
but allow you to turn it on and turn it
off yeah they can send a receive
information yeah so you could be like
kitchen light bulb on yeah I mean that
kind of stuff exists right now but the
problem is that it's really expensive
the app ecosystems are not that
consistent yeah
and it's just not quite it's not quite
there yet moving on we have Microsoft
acquiring Mojang so the guys that make
Minecraft for 2.5 billion dollars it was
officially announced on September 15th
I'm miss Pamela same switch Jen oh my
goodness that is a lot of money so I
mean and sorry this is again posted on
the forum by the same guy that posted
over there
et rjrj there we go so a lot of the
community is is pretty is pretty upset
about you know feeling like they they
got abandoned by knotch at the same time
like but I get it yeah he has his
reasons he said that he decided he
doesn't want the responsibility of
owning a company of such global
significance and you know what he's kind
of caught a point because yeah I think
and it's not it's not a matter of
selling out when you've already made the
money not chosen have to work another
day in his life but he will yeah because
he's his passion he wants to do
something else
but when you're when you're when you're
running something of such significance
that's of importance to so many people
you end up trapped he became minecraft
instead of being himself he was
minecraft at this point in time and so
you know yes he sold the money for what
he could get I mean I don't think that
that's an unfair thing to do and I don't
I think it's unreasonable to expect
someone to I don't know what give the
company way like like how do you how do
you get rid of the company without
selling out it's not even you're gonna
run into a ton of legal difficulty
trying to give away an asset that's
worth billions of dollars like that that
is not ok you legitimately can't do
so if he wants out if he doesn't want to
do minecraft for the rest of his life
then you know what I guess it's it might
be better to do it now than to wait even
longer and longer and longer and I think
I think that it's uh I don't know I I'm
excited to see what he's gonna do next
yeah yeah me too because and other
things that I heard like this isn't
necessarily in the dark and I haven't
done enough research on this at all but
I've just kind of heard through the
rumor mill that a lot of it was being
frustrated too because he wants to work
on all these other different things but
the second he does everyone's like boy
you're working on my crafts look how
much money is making you why are you
working Micah yeah he's like I don't
care when you when you have that many
millions of dollars like I think some
people feel like they need more millions
of dollars but when you have that much
money a lot of people are just gonna
kind of go yeah you know what I'm set
for life this is fine and and you know
the funny thing the funny thing about it
is even guys like I saw I saw an
interesting I saw an interesting quote
from Donald Trump not that long ago
where he was talking about why why he
wheels and deals why he tries to make
more money he's like yeah I don't need
money
basically I'm driven and I and III you
know I love to deal you know I love to I
love to buy I love to sell I this is
this is what I do this is what gets me
up in the morning and I kind of went
yeah you know I I kind of I guess I
gotta get that yeah and you know if
notches passion is making great games
and ultimately it's not about the money
then that doesn't mean he can't make a
ton of money doing it it just means that
he's gonna be driven to do that thing
and if we put him in this box where it's
like you have to work on Minecraft
because money that's not gonna make any
sense no in his head no interesting
situation I'm be but I also I like I
also get it because minecraft was is so
community driven it's all about
community and
feeling like a fearless leader for a
long yeah I mean you've had this you've
had this advocate you've had this face
to put on minecraft where unfortunately
you know what does face on minecraft
anymore the graphics ain't that good you
want a better face so boxy alright we've
got some pretty good news here so Opie
is QWERTY Warrior Visa released the
displayport 1.3 standard so the maximum
link bandwidth has been increased to 32
point four gigabit per second so the
reason we need higher link bandwidth to
you guys is not only higher resolution
displays but higher refresh rate
displays currently with DisplayPort 1.2
4k is limited to 60 Hertz but there's no
real reason why particularly a TN panel
couldn't run higher than 60 Hertz why
not why not why Poe I put everyone in a
box no no we want faster display links
so that we can start getting faster and
faster refresh rates on these higher
resolution displays so extremely excited
to see that it's about a 50% increase in
maximum refresh rate or an in maximum
bandwidth versus DisplayPort 1.2 a it
should be noted though that that's not
going to translate directly into 50%
higher resolution or 50% higher for
frame rate because you're gonna have
more overhead built into that so there
we go actually that's the next point in
the dock here so the combined link rate
delivers twenty five point nine two
gigabit per second of uncompressed video
data so that allows higher resolutions
like the recently announced 5k 51 twenty
by twenty eight eighty and that's
through one cable without compression
extremely exciting I mean you know what
as much as it's great that we're getting
interfaces that are going to be able to
handle these resolutions without
compression it is a Madi how Windows
can't and guys compressions not
necessarily the scariest thing in the
world a little bit of compression isn't
going to kill us and we are reaching the
limits of what copper based interfaces
are going to be able to do I mean
that's that's one of the reasons why
hdmi and displayport have been so slow
to continue increasing the bandwidth
because we're getting pretty close to
what we're gonna be able to do without
much more expensive without much more
expensive transmitters and receivers on
either end and or more expensive link
materials so we're either gonna get to
the point where we're legitimately going
to need fancy cables again to make that
video yeah I know crap or we're just
going to accept what so so the
processors are gonna get more complex
and less expensive and we're just going
to accept that we're gonna have to do
some on fly compression on the fly
compression and decompression and hope
that that doesn't add to the latency so
this is cool you can drive to 4k ultra
HD monitors when using basic coordinated
video timing continues to support VGA
DVI and HDMI via cheapo cheapo adapters
that's one of the things that I really
like about DisplayPort is that compared
to HDMI even HDMI 2.0 which the new gtx
980 supports and can handle 4k at 60
hertz DisplayPort adapts to other
standards much more easily which is huge
huge thumbs up although I was pretty
pleased to find out that hdmi 2.0 didn't
end up requiring a connector change yeah
yeah that was rumored for a long time
and it ended up not becoming a thing
extreme nice we got a rant about that on
the way in sure I think quite a while
back but yeah I think we did I mean on
the one hand okay but the flip side of
that is I sure wish HDMI had a locking
connector yes so I'm glad that we're
retaining forwards and backwards
compatibility for so long I mean that
really is admirable but it could have
even done like a side mounted screw
mount thing though there is the same
there is a company that does kind of
this ghetto locking HDMI connector I
think they patented it though okay
and what it does is it is it clips into
just part of the housing that's not
meant to be a lot yeah but it kind of
cheats and clips in there yeah so so
there you go visa
releases display part one place i
awesome moving down we have Comcast
telling you customers hold on hold on
just labor one point three enable
support for future 8k displays so that's
something that we should probably
mention and that's oh oh this is cool
also supports a single 4k monitor 60
Hertz 24-bit color over two lanes while
offering another two lanes for
alternative data types like super speed
USB data Oh
so that's pretty cool no DisplayPort is
really coming into its own and is going
to I I think it's just gonna be the
dominant it's really interesting
I mean look look at again back to GTX
980 how hard is NVIDIA banking on
DisplayPort three display port
connectors on the back of the card
pretty heavy dude yes pretty heavy-duty
I mean g-sync
only works over DisplayPort this is an
Nvidia technology that they kind of went
okay where's the industry heading we're
gonna bet on DisplayPort and you know
what for that matter AMD has done the
same thing yeah yeah
AMD was shipping cards with to display
port connectors much really around video
was so I mean when those two agree on
something probably a good thing just
putting that hood yeah so Comcast has
started telling customers to stop using
Core tour and they denied this they've
denied this under there yeah did you
post a link in the chat I have not yet
but I have alright so this was posted in
the forum by and then there was one and
there are a couple of articles that were
used as references for this though so
inquisitor calm and deep web comm but
there is there is a lot of information
here and I'll let you run through it an
agent named Jeremy I almost said Jenny
cuz I'm pretty tired but an agent named
Jeremy has lovely called tor an illegal
service and said that tor is against
their usage policies and apparently
they've repeatedly asked customers to
tell the agent what sites the users were
accessing through the tor browser one
customer spoke to Jeremy then called
back the next day and spoke with an
agent named Kelly she reiterated that
Comcast does not want its customers
using tor and she allegedly said that
users who try to use anonymity to cover
themselves on the Internet are usually
doing things they aren't so
to speak that that aren't so to speak
illegal we have the right to terminate
fine and or suspend your account at any
time due to violating the rules you know
to me fine should have to come from some
kind of legal entity yeah I mean if you
what what what's next the grocery stores
gonna find me like are you kidding like
if they if if I actually I guess a
grocery store is a bad example because
if I was walking around the grocery
store putting things into my coat so
that people wouldn't know what I was
buying I probably would get I probably
would be not explained
you wouldn't get fined but you could get
prosecuted I think they'd have to wait
for you leave the store with it but they
do they could have a plain clothing
year-round totally different that's
legitimately stealin no because what if
I intended to pay for it I just didn't
want people knowing what I was buying
but you've left the store with it no
let's say I didn't leave the store ok ok
so let's say I okay so hold on a second
ok so ok maybe I wouldn't ok so I
wouldn't get fined but let's let's go
ask you about it they could request you
to leave the store ok premises but they
can't arrest you you haven't left the
store yet what can they do they can
follow you around but then that's their
private property so that's allowed yeah
I don't think there's an equivalent to
this no I I'd love to hear from the
twitchchat guys let us know especially
there's like a loss prevention agents D
on 7 desk lul grocery police well if
there's a loss prevention agent out
there that actually knows they look like
shoving stuff yeah ok we'd love to hear
about that because I don't what's up
like okay so what's the equivalent like
my mom does this I know a lot of people
that do this kind of stuff where they're
like a go grab a drink from the fridge
in a store and just drink the whole
thing before they're done leaving the
store and then just buy it yeah I you
know the funny thing about that is it's
always made me really uncomfortable even
when I was a kid I I it might know my
aunt my aunt would often say you know
hey are you thirsty you know here here
get this and start drinking it and I'd
be like no I don't wanna drink until we
leave would you'd be like well we're
something like what if my cart doesn't
work we're shopping we're not leaving so
awkward
I'm not even worried about that although
I did have a really awkward situation at
Tim Hortons where I I forgot my wallet
and my wife forgot her wallet and we
were in Vancouver and I had already
placed my order and I was like oh crap I
forgot my wallet kind of run out to the
car and grab my wife's so when I come
back she's got my order ready for me and
I'm like yo Dawg I'm sorry my wife
doesn't have her wallet either I have to
go I think I made it up to them I went
and I borrowed some money from a
relative who lives in Vancouver and then
I went all the way back to that Tim
Hortons even though it was out of my way
I was like I have cash you know you know
but I thought they probably had to throw
at least some of the way like I feel
terrible anyway sorry what were we
talking about it's doing stuff from
stores yanking things really right I
just feel weird about it
I just know I don't do it I know my I
think my mom does a little bit I know
other people that I go shopping with
McDonagh and even with when I'm with
someone who's doing it I feel super
uncomfortable I don't know why you have
to have you on video someone has to
watch you put it in your pocket they can
follow you and watch you but you have
not broken the law until you attempt to
leave the state without pain okay
so there you go perfectly reasonable
because you should be able to go around
a shopping center without a basket or
shopping cart right I mean they can ask
you to leave your bag at the front yeah
so I usually and they can ask you to
leave the store yeah yeah it is there
what is their right to do that yeah we
have five thousand live viewers right
now who are tuned into our stream was
like super late like two hours late
like genki genki quality don't know
anything about the topics in the middle
we have no we have no lighting other
than like the terrible florescent
lighting in my board room yeah and and
you know what guys thanks for showing up
we love your support really we
appreciate you guys you guys are cool
speaking of things that aren't cool is
comcast has has a past of being against
tour and is listed on towards bad ISP
project list thing all right so well as
if as if Comcast was not I stood on a
good one
good hi as people kill more anyway all
right so this next topic is from and
then there was one as well original
articles from VentureBeat so the NSA is
mapping the internet I'm not sure if
this is news but NSA stuff just like
assume anything you could ever dream of
that's like bad and on the Internet so
the program is trying to create an
interactive map of the global Internet
in close to real time that would try to
identify the devices through which data
flows such as routers the program is
supposed to helping computer attack and
exploit planning offering a battlefield
map for cyber warfare targeted is good
yeah yeah yeah so targeted companies
include annoyed telecom the owner of
t-mobile and the German ISP net cologne
so pretty cool and I say you guys are
just staying cool this is interesting
because Germany was already pissed off
yeah right about tapping into what's
earnings phone so pretty interesting
this next one they do really know
nothing about it
are we gonna do this one are we gonna
jump over it yeah I know yeah let's
let's let's go ahead so apples warrant
canary disappears suggesting new Patriot
Act demands so this was originally
posted by lols on the forum you don't
have an actual link though yeah it's
okay okay the original article is from
gig ohm so if you want to just maybe
post that link in the in the chat so
Apple's first transparency report on
government activity in late 2013
included a footnote that stated Apple
has never received an order under
Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act we
would expect to challenge such an order
if served on us so writer and cyber
activists cory doctorow recognized that
language as a warrant canary or a way of
warding the secrecy imposed by the
patriot act companies and publishers
have included these Canaries to signal
to their users that so far they have not
been subjected to a given tie
secret subpoena by law enforcement when
this language is removed it is likely
that the situation has changed and the
company has been subject to such a
request but of course is being told that
they can't say anything about it so
having that canary in place protects
them and their users as long as people
are paying attention so section 215 of
the Patriot Act permits the NSA to
demand companies to hand over their
business records in secret it is
believed that it is the legal foundation
of the prism program so yeah not good
mind you this this comes this comes out
around the same time as Apple's recent
change to the way they handle user data
which is awesome which is pretty awesome
that basically in a nutshell means that
if your phone is locked
even Apple cannot get to it so that is
is pretty much their way of throwing up
their hands and going well okay you
served us a warrant for something we
legitimately can't access so pace bro I
really like that that's really cool and
I actually know a lot of people that are
pretty heavy Android users that might
legitimately switch just because of that
reason it's it's a reasons it's one of a
big view I'd like to see how Google
responds to this yeah because I you know
the way that the way that Google is
about data farming they want to do they
want all your data on it all the time
and they want it all the time I got to
feel like if Google were to decide that
they were gonna leave your data alone
when your phone is locked would be that
would be very out of character for them
so I don't know he might put them in a
bit of an awkward position mm-hmm all
right so this was originally posted on
the forum by ion basa the world's first
fully functional 3d printed car this was
bound to happen you got a bet that there
were any number of people working on
making this happen oh my god you can
download a car so it was designed
printed and driven by Arizona based
Local Motors
printing and assembly took just 44 our
local motors these are the guys that
make
try to think that I'm hoping to get
alright dad for the review don't worry
about it
probably won't even happen yeah after 44
hours hours the car was drivable
its main the strat I so Italian four
layers electric powered it's a two-seat
compact roadster it has a battery a
motor wiring and suspension these all
came from a variety of sources including
Renault Weezy city car twice II I don't
know I'm clearly tired and I apologize
for any words that I'm slurring or or
pronouncing correctly cuz I just
yeah GTX processors chassis and body are
printed from a carbon fiber reinforced
plastic compound has only 40 parts to it
in comparison to a normal car with
20,000 or more parts this is actually
the size into a conversation we had
earlier today where we were talking
about how electric cars right now are
very expensive but once they become more
of a commodity item and less of a less
of a curiosity less high-tech I expect
them to actually be much cheaper don't
even know what's battery production
because though because that Giga factory
that tell us I know right that's only
the good name of Tesla by calling them
Telus I feel like a horrible person you
are a horrible factory that Tesla is
intending to build in Nevada will
actually produce more of that type of
battery than all of the other factories
in the entire world combined right now
yeah yeah sounds like ridiculous so with
battery production going up to that
extent I am expecting and base just
based on how simple yeah an electric car
is compared to an internal combustion
car I mean I I think I think gas-powered
vehicles are gonna look stupid to my
kids by the time they're old enough to
be adults buying a car it's it's gonna
be this it's gonna be this weird you
know
eccentric thing to do to own a fossil
fuel powered vehicle I really do think
so I think that we're still going to
continue to see fossil fuels augment
battery
power so having a small you know lawn
mower like Ryder mower class internal
combustion engine in there to charge the
battery and an emergency or whatever
else I think we're gonna continue to see
that but expecting cars to just run on
gas I don't know
industrial vehicles potential especially
being down here actually it's pretty
amazing
while we were coming to and media
headquarters I saw on the road at least
ten different electric cars and like not
just Tesla's because this area is known
for Tesla's a whole wide range of them
so that was actually really interesting
to see the 3d printed car will cost
anywhere between 18 and 30 thousand
dollars though so right now the
materials alone are probably what's
driving up the cost I mean just plain
plastic filament nothing special about
it incredibly expensive you buy enough
of that stuff to build a car you're
gonna be spending a lot of money now you
talk about carbon fiber reinforced
filament yeah and also it's it's gonna
be such low volume at the beginning that
you're not gonna be able to take
advantage of motors kind of a specialty
kind of shop so it's not surprising I
mean if they were producing a thousand
times as many of them I think we would
see prices drop pretty consider and I'm
sure if you work with them it's gonna be
a very personalized experience as well
this is kind of cool too the cost might
seem high at first but many of the parts
can be reused when you decide to trade
change cars or upgrade so a point yeah
I'm guessing things like the motor could
potentially be reused if you decide to
you know though okay I want a single
seater type vehicle I don't see any
reason why you could put it inside a
different 3d printed vehicle yeah or a
very different angle where's like if
your battery's running kind of crap you
can swap the battery out keep using the
chassis and the motor and all that's up
or if the motor dies for some reason you
can keep using the battery in the
chassis mm-hmm and that's another thing
too that's that's really cool about the
simplicity of an electric vehicle is I
think the scariness of car mechanic work
is gonna go away to a great extent I
mean Tesla showed off what they swap a
battery 96
90 seconds late and that's not like huge
better in the bottom yeah so if they can
do it in 90 seconds I'm sure I can do it
in an hour
yeah you know yeah I think I can
probably handle that you'd have to you
dude if you had a torque driver that's
it I think that's the only thing you
really need Wow is you have to be able
to torque in the screws to a very
specific right and then I think yeah but
you can you can you can buy one of those
for what like 40 bucks at Canadian Tire
maybe 15 but I think that's all you
actually need you need to be a jack up
the car
okay and then a torque driver I think
that's all you need Wow that's
outstanding
obviously not entirely sure but because
I don't think anyone has tried doing it
themselves anyways as far as I know that
tell me all right so this was originally
posted by tech fanatic on the forum and
this this is this is actually pretty
funny I haven't found out if this ever
happened because we weren't out of
public event yeah we weren't at the
public event down in down in LA but
there was an email sent out by AMD to
their team red members ready to
infiltrate game 24 mentions the warm
reception from enthusiasts about their
recent AMD 30 live webcast mentioned
that we're intrigued that another
graphics products company jumped on the
bandwagon by announcing a similar event
they warmly encouraged their fans to
attend event proudly wearing their
favorite red t-shirt and encourage their
viewers to tweet pictures of themselves
wearing their colors at the events and
promised to send some love the way of
their users I haven't I haven't actually
been tuned into the internet enough to
know if anything happened so honestly
any time I was I was dual streaming our
own stream to talk to the chat so I
haven't really seen the actual game 24
stream in its entirety I know I haven't
even seen the intro videos for the
modders whose builds we were covering
the creation of for the last 24 hours so
you know what we've got to do before we
end the show here guys we're gonna do
our sponsors next I think then we've got
a few more topics thought before we in
the show we're gonna we're gonna pick up
the camera off the tripod because I
think we have
ability to do that here it should be
easier to move it and we're gonna we're
gonna come and we're gonna take a close
look at these rigs because they are
absolutely beautiful you guys are gonna
you guys are gonna love them I am amazed
at what these teams did in 24 hours how
much battery life we were running in
right now we are sitting at around 45
minutes okay yeah we're cool we're
running were running a store make sure
yeah I don't have I don't have another I
don't have an AC adapter for the camera
so we can very limited by battery life
right now yeah yeah so he said yeah yeah
let's go ahead and do do you want to
change over to our charger spots
actually I've got a I've got a site for
you to head to I want to do Squarespace
first so guys Squarespace
Oh
don't provoke yeah alright whoo we are
back thankfully are we still streaming
we're still streaming okay Oh
Squarespace the fast easy way to create
your own beautiful website that works
where we go yeah yeah no no I've got
I've got a URL for sheekha frigging
stressing me out here man it's forever
fresh dot-com F Rai CH e that's spelling
of fresh so Squarespace guys do be do I
have the lower third up you do so
squarespace.com slash Linus is where to
go if you want to give us credit for you
know referring you to Squarespace
basically if you've ever wanted to make
your own website Squarespace is a
fantastic way to do it they've got great
tools including their logo creator their
website creator they make it easy to use
they also give you the ability to dig a
little bit deeper if you are more
experienced or if you want to get
something off the ground now and then
learn as you go and continue to develop
your mobile site whether it's a blog or
a store or just a portfolio or really
anything just an informational website
that you want to run and what's really
cool about Squarespace is what are we
are we still are we still working that
looks fair yes it's frozen because I'm
screen region 800k that's good
so one really cool thing about what
Squarespace does for the Linus tech tips
when show podcast is every single month
they sponsor us without fail they
sponsor two episodes a month they give
us a lot of support so guys if you're if
you know anyone who's looking for a
website they want to make their own
website refer them to Squarespace you
won't regret it
they won't regret it so there's all that
good stuff and what's even cooler than
that is if you decide to give
Squarespace a try they have a two-week
trial no commitment required two-week
trial you create your own website if you
decide to do that create your own
website and tweet it to me with hashtag
line of Squarespace we give away an
entire year of Squarespace hosted
website for once every single month so
forever free
fresh is our winner for this month so
let's go ahead and get that up on the
screen if fluke could go ahead and I
think round some trouble because the
resolution of the desktop was so crazy
high oh that makes sense
Rico we are streaming on a three K
notebook right now it's an ARS x3 so
yeah we're not really sure how to handle
the screen region capturing right now at
this moment so can you just make the
browser small and make a smaller screen
change all the streaming gears so the
point is guys go Squarespace thank you
forever fresh for for tweeting that to
me with hash tag line of Squarespace you
are the big winner for this month cool
thing another cool thing about
squarespace's they have highly dynamic
hosting plans to take care of all the
hosting for you and as your business or
your blog continues to grow it can scale
with you and grow with you you never
have to worry about things not working
and people having a bad experience when
they come to your website so are you
just doing a snipping tool love it all
right well I'm gonna move on to our next
sponsor spot in the meantime unless
you're unless you're ready to just kind
of kind of go for gold here there we go
fandom glass is another sponsor that we
actually we love these guys oh yeah
these guys are one of those companies
where most of the time when someone
reaches out to me out of the blue and
they go hey we've had this like mobile
accessory it's like a screen protector
we want you to review it the lights just
turn off or do like its motion yeah
awesome okay so we have this screen
protector that we want you guys to
review I kind of look at and I go are
you guys kidding we don't we're not
gonna we're not gonna do an entire
review video of a screen protector
because one it's a screen protector and
two they're mostly garbage but these
guys reached out and I kind of went okay
you're Canadian so I'll give my canadian
bros a chance here I'm gonna I'm gonna
at least read the email and then I kinda
made my way through the email what
that's actually smart
because the whole idea behind phantom
glass is that you're using the same
Gorilla Glass 3 glass that's already on
your phone as a protective layer over
top of your phone and so I kind of went
ok send it to me and I may or may not
review it it's gonna depend on how much
I like it so they sent it to me and
their claim was that their nano coating
whatever nonsense that they call it
would allow the screen to be applied
bubble free every time and allowed to be
taken off and reapplied should the need
arise and I kind of went bs ok ok sure
and so the first time I was applying it
when I was doing my review video I was
like super careful I'm like you know
making my way down the screen pressing a
cross and I was like ok I got this on I
got this on perfect cool and then for
the second one they actually sent me two
of them I just put it on all the bubbles
made their way out it actually made for
a pretty compelling video and phantom
glass reached out to us because of our
review and you know how how well we were
able to we were able to capture on video
how well the product worked and they
were like hey we want to sponsor you
guys we want to work with you guys so
sometimes these these random things
start up like that anyway the point is
phantom glass is a great product and all
of a sudden we've went from we've gone
from they sent us a random email and I
kind of turned my nose up at them too
now we consider them a partner we think
it's a great product
absolutely great product and highly
recommended so visit store dot phantom
glass to learn more all right I wanna
give yeah we want to we want to give
this website some props I mean the thing
about Squarespace is that it's pretty
easy to make your site look great but it
still is a matter of you know picking a
good template and you're picking photos
that look really nice you know I wish we
could navigate on it because some of the
people who submit these these these
trial sites to us they don't really put
much work into it and this one actually
you can navigate a fair bit or even so
guys on the stream you know please do
please do check out the site and if you
like it man
maybe give Squarespace a try all I can
really do is good all right
SanDisk this is easy SanDisk announced
the world's biggest SD card at 512
gigabytes literally half the size of the
largest consumer grade full-size SSDs
and we're talking an SD card it can add
right at speeds of up to 90 megabytes
per second and should be able to hold
about four hours of 4k footage or 24
hours of 1080p footage depending on
settings this is according to geek comm
has an MSRP of $800 actually not that
unreasonable I know but it's pretty
nasty
I know how many we have that die okay
okay you know what though funny that you
should mention that we've never had a
Santa's die it's true we've never had a
send this guy we've never had an a day
to die so you know if I was and it's
it's it's so funny because SD cards are
one of those very simple devices where
brand loyalty much like hard drives gets
built just based on someone's personal
experience and based on that we do have
a fair bit of experience doing various
very small and not statistically
significant but that doesn't change the
fact that when you when you go through
enough eighty eight hour SanDisk SD
cards and none of them die you kind of
go okay well maybe we'll use some more
that ah the Logitech G 910 I keep on
getting missing so this was posted by X
tank Slayer and basically Logitech is
working on our well has announced an our
GP mechanical gaming keyboard based on
Romer G mechanical switches so it is it
is funny to see the way the industry
went from consolidating everyone just
chipping clones of cherries and X switch
keyboards to everyone trying to
differentiate it again
sudden so razors going to their their
razor branded switches that are being
manufactured in China Corsair is still
this still playing the the Cherry MX
trumpet pretty hardcore in fact they've
started putting cherry branding right on
their packaging that partnership is
alive and well
logitech who to my knowledge has only
done one mechanical gaming keyboard you
some ten-point g7 10 plus has gone and
released what looks to be positioned as
a higher-end product with Romer G
switches now so no I know nothing I know
absolutely nothing about memory switches
obviously I haven't been able to really
spend time trying to figure it out yeah
because the most amount of information
i've seen about this is in this dock
right now yes so I've I've been a little
busy with my k70 RGB which has a 130
plus page user manual by the way this
this is like the not for noobs keyboard
as far as I can tell so far although I
made my way through about the first 40
pages on the flight here and most of it
is pretty self-explanatory well there's
that once once you get to it there's
that like full light control panel thing
that's gonna be complicated yeah so
Logitech is gonna have their arcs
control SDK that's going to allow you to
control your peripherals from your phone
screen dpi etc ok and show system
information you're gonna have media
controls for tablets or smartphones a
logitech he is sending SOG 910 ok so
I've already been in touch and we are we
are gonna definitely try it out and
really interested to learn more about
the switches see I mean they're rating
them for more clicks which for me you
know going okay well ours is 70 million
keystrokes versus your 50 million
keystrokes it's all kind of especially
with an academic especially like
mechanical switches it's like yeah these
don't really break yeah I mean I think
cherry is braiding at 50 million is
probably pretty crude
yeah this sounds all right cool I think
you just skipped over it with your
cursor but belief on that posted by
raphe on the forum original articles
from the verge calm and BitTorrent is
determined to get rid of the stigma and
that's good because they don't deserve
it no so so tell us about it tell us
about believe I honestly know nothing
about it this is the first time I've
seen anything about it but the second I
read any information about it so it's
it's it's basically a chat client where
it's practically impossible
quote-unquote to gather metadata on
who's talking and it will be available
for Windows seven eight Mac Android iOS
clients basically everything the second
I read that which is basically all I
really needed to know it's also in
public alpha by the way I I'm pretty
stoked and I might move a lot of things
to this platform if it actually works
really well because not a fan of Skype
yeah hate it but it's the only thing
that I can seem to be able to get
everyone on at the same time and
everyone has the same complaints about
it which this might be able to solve
right which would be great so I hope
they have stuff like group chats which
would be very important for stuff that I
do and I don't know it would be really
easy and really interesting to see maybe
if they have I mean we've seen how
quickly BitTorrent sync is moving oh my
goodness yeah so BitTorrent sync is
changing really fast so that's their
that's their kind of I don't want to
call it a Dropbox competitor because
it's not but it has some similar
functionality to cloud-based storage
solutions like Dropbox except you
control your own cloud and that's what
that's what BitTorrent is all about
maintaining your anonymity and your
privacy and controlling your own data
and you gotta respect that
as a company mission statement
apparently from Comcast
you are illegal and shouldn't get off
their service but thinking of illegal
Pirate Bay founder told he can expect to
carry his father's coffin while wearing
handcuffs
this is this is pretty gross there's
only 50 days left on his sentence and
his brother Matz has spoken out for for
apparently the first time the original
articles from TorrentFreak calm has
spoken up for the first time in his
brother's favor saying you know I've
deliberately said very little partly
because he can speak for himself but I
feel like the the justice system has
forgotten about its job to support
prisoners to ensure that they don't
return to prison and even though their
father has been seriously ill for some
time and was admitted to the hospital in
the summer Peter has only been able to
visit his father once and has been told
he's allowed to attend his father's
funeral but two guards will accompany
him and he will have to wear handcuffs
and his his brother basically is
speaking out against this the IKE sorry
give us one moment is speaking out
against us saying well the problem with
this is that it punishes not only him
but also me and my mother and my dead
father and everyone that's gonna be the
few and everyone who's gonna be at the
funeral that doesn't feel fair the
optics on that are gonna be horrible yep
Google seizes Nexus 5 production this
was posted by top board gamer on the
forum original article is from SlashGear
this came from Canadian wireless carrier
Wind Mobile's customer support via
Twitter a customer asked why they don't
list the Nexus 5 on their device page
and Wynne said well because it's no
longer being made and we don't have any
stock Samsung to build its own mobile
GPU this is posted on Fazil accom but if
that'll be more more suing from Nvidia
mmm interesting Samsung has managed to
hire X Nvidia AMD and Intel employees
nothing has been announced yet the
development has apparently been going on
for at least two years
all right we're pretty much gonna have
to know that any quick thing before we
go actually because I know quite a few
my friends are really excited about this
is that twitch announces its Google
Chrome cam yes
posted by raphe on the forums the
original source has blogged on twitch.tv
this is exciting yeah so there's there's
obviously no one else to say but it's
sweet yeah so now you can you can you
can watch the land show on your TV with
your o guest yeah yeah next week cuz
this one's basically over yeah um so I
do want to
want to pick up the camera there I think
all right if we're being checked out
because it's time for everyone to go to
dinner and I'm here so everyone's just
kind of somehow tired in general yeah
sure so um you know what
oh I don't have I don't have my lav mic
unfortunately so you know what here's
what I'm gonna do I'm just gonna oh I
don't know if I can pop it you know what
I'm just gonna carry this this is the
ghettoest ghettoest setup ever but I'm
gonna I'm gonna hold this like this and
we want to show you guys we want to show
you guys these mod it out rigs I think
the most be careful not to press that
middle button yeah all right I got no
idea man
oh the XLR cable well you don't need to
get that far right if you hear it if you
put the laptop on the table I think you
should be you should be long enough to
to reach the rigs here so
