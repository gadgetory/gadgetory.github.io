Radeon HD 3870 launched back in 2007 to
the RX 480 a ton has changed AMD is
using a manufacturing process for nodes
smaller the current king has double the
PCIe bandwidth up to 16 times the video
frame buffer size support for DirectX 12
and Vulcan vs DX 10.1 and it actually
costs less so let's take a look at AMD
video card innovation over the last 10
years and see how it is that we got here
the master Keys Pro keyboard lineup from
Coolermaster is available in three sizes
each in white or RGB flavours check them
out at the link below we already had
quite a few of the representatives we
needed of AMD's top single GPU graphics
card for each generation but there were
a few codename xt cards missing from our
pokedex so this project began as so many
seem to have lately with eBay dot CA
because Canadians don't get the good
eBay for our test we went with a
high-end modern test bench to avoid
bottlenecks and we ran a mix of
synthetic benchmarks and games both
modern and it kills me to think of
things I played as a teenager as classic
or retro but we've got some of that too
first up is the Radeon HD 3870 this was
truly a dark time for the AMD rebellion
their previous generation flagship 2900
XP with its groundbreaking but very
expensive 512 bit memory bus had just
gotten its but soundly kicked by Nvidia
SGA T so it was time for a strategy
shift instead of building a huge complex
GPU AMD built a smaller more efficient
one relying on crossfire technology to
reach the high-end enthusiast market
thanks to being built on a 55 verses 18
and a meter process the 3870 managed to
perform similarly while being much
cheaper than its predecessor and II
looked to build on the success of that
lower performance but lower risk
strategy with the 4870 codename rv770 xt
was a substantially larger chip than the
38 70 at 256 millimeters squared but
that extra performance and frame buffer
sizes up to two gigs allowed AMD to
commend a higher price and that still
just over half the size of their last
attempt at a big
GPU the Radeon HD 5870 marked a return
to confidence for AMD with over two
billion transistors a move from their
terascale to terascale to architecture
bringing with it DirectX 11 support
implementation of PCIe gen 2.1 and a
process shrink from 55 nanometer to 40
nanometer it was an ambitious project
not to mention that this was the
beginning of AMD's push for multi
display gaming technology that they
called Eyefinity 5870 performed very
well against invidious furnace of a GTX
480 and still holds up well enough today
but it might be worth modding your
cooler if your fan dies the HD 6970
built on this success again and the
officially dubbed its architecture
terascale 3 but due to TSM C's cancelled
32 nanometer node it was actually built
on the same 40 nanometer manufacturing
process so performance wasn't
dramatically better with die size
transistor count and notably power
consumption all rising substantially
that lasts in particular was a trend
that just couldn't continue indefinitely
the HD 7970 was another huge undertaking
AMD went from 2.6 for to over 4 billion
transistors with a wide 384 bit memory
interface they moved to the 28 nanometer
manufacturing process they added support
for PCI Express gen3 to the amusement of
enthusiasts who noted that AMD
motherboard chipsets didn't and up until
very recently fail didn't have official
support for it and introduced the world
to the DirectX 12 and Vulcan compatible
GCN architecture that has been the
beating heart of every AMD card and apu
since not to mention the current gen
game consoles from all three of the big
players it's compelling performance and
forward-looking feature set ended up
saving AMD a lot of our
d-money in subsequent years the 7970 was
introduced as a top-of-the-line cart but
would end up being recycled twice as the
7970 gigahertz edition and 280x
in lieu of developing new GPUs to
compete with nvidia step down 700 series
cards the Radeon HD 290x that came next
was a formal return in many ways to the
home run swing strategy that had
ultimately led AMD down over half a
decade prior it was huge slightly larger
than the 2900 XT it rocked over 6
billion transistors it had a 512 bit
memory bus again and ran an upgraded
version of GC n dubbed GC n 2nd gen
which all sounds great on paper but it
was damn near impossible to manufacture
at a reasonable cost
it ran hotter than summer on the
tropical island where they hosted the
launch event and sounded like the jet
that I flew there on it's killer
features mantle and trueaudio were
absorbed or ignored and it took over a
year of driver development to reach its
full potential at which time AMD
promptly relaunched it as 390x they
called it granada xt instead of hawaii
xt and claimed to have tweaked it but
evidence for actual changes to the
hardware beyond the availability of
higher density memory chips that enabled
it to ship with eight gigs of vram and
small process improvements at the chip
fab level to achieve slightly higher
rated clock speeds has never
materialized our nine fury acts on the
other hand was not a rebadged for sure
this thing made Hawaii and Grenada look
like toys it introduced a new generation
of GCN with a high quality video scaler
and lossless delta color compression it
was the first GPU to use HBM or high
bandwidth memory which is
high-performance 3d stacked DRAM
next to the GPU for a marketed 4096 bit
memory interface and boasted a
completely ludicrous 596 millimeter
squared I was just shy of 9 billion
transistors I mean I don't blame them
you got to do what you got to do to
appease PCMR is insatiable lust for
frame rates and the GPU industry had
been stuck with 28 nanometer
manufacturing for well over three years
but when your flagship graphics card
needs a prepackaged water cooler it
might be time to take your foot off the
gas pedal which is exactly what they did
just over four years later Andy came
full circle abandoning the revolutionary
new features of their previous flagship
in favor of something a little more
practical if Siri X was a Ferrari then
our X 480 is an EcoBoost Mustang are you
sure it's not as fast but it consumes
just over half as much power is
available with up to double the vram
since unlike HBM gddr5 is available on
the cheap does this with a guy size
that's less than half partially thanks
to a shiny new 14 nanometer
manufacturing process and oh did I
mention it's less than a third of the
price though with all that said I
wouldn't count out AMD as a high-end
competitor just yet they played it safe
this generation by launching the sweet
spot GPU first but we've seen working
high-end hardware and Vega is coming
thanks for watching AMD GPUs through the
ages you can check out our previous
episodes on Intel CPUs and water blocks
which we'll have hopefully over there
and you can leave a comment if you have
suggestions for future follow-ups are
you a freelancer or small business owner
