motherboard videos on this channel for a
long freaking time and as for why well
we've said it before there are parts of
your computer that dramatically affect
performance and there are part that if
you're willing to forego a few creature
comforts you can save a few bucks on but
how low can you go today we are looking
at the e CS a 55 s - m4 1.0 the cheapest
motherboard on Amazon in a standard form
factor it's only 30 bucks
it isn't it beautiful
Brow's privately and securely with
tunnel there the simple VPN app try
tunnel bear for free at the link in the
video description now first things first
to properly appreciate the ghetto
fabulousness of this motherboard I gotta
get in character meet el unit sort of a
V anyway we're going to start by taking
a look at this baby from the back I'm
talking rear i/o man yeah nobody there
don't worry about it anyway we can see
it is absolutely packed with gaming
features I'm talking to ps2 ports ps2
with support for n key rolled over
something that's still rare even on
high-end USB keyboards on that subject
we have four USB 2.0 ports that puts
this on par with the a since crosshair 6
and in a huge beam when you're
installing windows 7 via USB like I
always do on Friday nights
throw in a touch of Gigabit Ethernet and
audio jacks rated at signal-to-noise
ratio and we are ready to get our
counter-strike source on oh and did I
mention it supports both VGA and HDMI
more on that later first let's check out
the internal connectivity as I call it
junk under the hood not only do we get
four see the three gigabit per second
connections right there in the bottom
right that's 12 gigabits per second
total but we also have support for four
more USB to ports via the front panel I
mean you've got to be some kind of kid
or some to afford enough USB is to plug
into all that high-definition audio tech
I know the definition of high know what
I'm saying and Brit it we got Spitak BAM
whatever that needs but let's get
serious again
what are those headers down there
that my friends is a serial interface
like serial killer and a parallel
interface like a parallel dimension
highly desirable features that very few
motherboards come equipped with nowadays
possibly as a cost-saving measure but no
such corners were cut on the ECF a 55 F
- m4 1.0 this version 1.0 because they
get it right the first time
no I'm saying and thanks to these we can
use virtually any peripheral or printer
that we want ok line aside so this board
has more i/o than we know what to do
with for a number of reasons but what
kind of balls-to-the-wall hardware can
we put on here well feast your eyes on
this baby it supports up to the a8 3870
apu which unlike Rison needs ddr3 only
to be flippin awesome and comes with
integrated Radeon graphics processing
it's better than some of the dedicated
cards we tested and with 4 cores at 3
billion Hertz this one point seven eight
billion transistor beast is unlocked
primed and ready for the toughest gaming
challenges we can throw at it plus it's
compatible with socket am3 coolers so
we'll be able to make use of our
existing stock here now we got to match
this beast with nothing but the best
so we've got ourselves after we get it
installed here yeah there you go it's on
there get the RAM in there
yeah it's fast like that so we're
putting our gtx 980ti in what we got a
full-length PCI Express slot here we're
talking 168 ends of power and data here
that's right so combining this with our
four Llano course and 16 gigs of ram
baby there is nothing this thing can't
run technically speaking that is we
aren't promising that it will run well
compared to our kv leg test bench
limiting ourselves to this class of cpu
is actually a lot to give up even when
overclocked single-threaded performance
on this thing okay we can lose the we
can lose the same thing it is anywhere
from about 1/2 to 1/5 of the speed of Kb
lake and multi-threaded performance is
as low as 1/6 but we've all heard that
DirectX 12 and Vulcan can actually favor
weaker CPUs regardless of the GPU
thanks to their lower API overhead and
as we can see here oh well yeah it just
gets dominated even with a 1080 Ti in
CPU intensive games like Deus Ex mankind
divided we get a decent bump with our
overclock on DirectX 11 but not on
DirectX 12 where we actually end up
within our margin of error so then in
all seriousness what are you actually
getting with a board like this well you
are locking yourself into an ancient
platform that only had one very
underwhelming generation of CPU support
you are losing support for even sort of
new features like USB 3 and SATA 6
gigabits nevermind nvme and USB 3.1 and
you are stepping down to a level of
build quality and firm
where support that is frankly
unacceptable for anyone let alone
enthusiasts I mean yes technically you
can overclock it but barely
with that said is it usable well if you
take anything away from this video it's
that the advice of don't worry about the
motherboard should really be taken with
the caveat that it means within a given
generation of hardware if you're buying
the top-of-the-line board for the heck
of it you are doing neither the board
nor your wallet any justice but in the
case of this thing well I think it's
safe to say that buying the flat out
cheapest is another way to achieve
exactly that FreshBooks cloud accounting
software was custom built for you small
business owner or freelancer it's the
simple way to be more productive more
organized and get paid faster you can
create and send professional-looking
invoices in less than 30 seconds you can
track your expenses you can track your
hours on the jobs and then you can
actually accept payment even through the
platform setup online payments with just
a couple clicks and get paid up to four
days faster this is a really cool
feature I don't even know how they did
this but you can actually see when your
client has seen your invoice too and put
an end to the nonsense did you get it oh
no sorry I didn't I'll pay you next week
now half of that pay now so for your
unrestricted 30-day free trial go to WWF

the how you heard about us section so
thanks for watching
I hope you guys enjoyed our fun little
look at the cheapest motherboard on
newegg.com if you just like this video
you can hit that button but if you liked
it hit the like button get subscribed
maybe consider checking out where to buy
maybe not this maybe we'll put some like
reasonable motherboard and CPU option
down there that we act
recommend is a good value we've got that
links in the video description and so
don't forget to subscribe and oh yeah
also down there we have a link to our
merge stories to buy cool t-shirts like
this no wait no three plus one I think
it's like one phase for RAM wait no no
there's no no nose for this is for face
card what you talked about wills that's
also that 32 nanometer CPU you know how
big an animator is a tiny man there's
like there's like not even any copper in
it you know ah sorry do we even sleep
that oh you're rolling oh good okay
