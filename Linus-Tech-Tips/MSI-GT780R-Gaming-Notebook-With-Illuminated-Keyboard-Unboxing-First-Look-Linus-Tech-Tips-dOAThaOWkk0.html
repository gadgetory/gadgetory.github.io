pretty exciting from MSI it comes from
well a pretty plain brown box initially
but I'm sure we will find a more
suitable retail oriented box inside this
is just a shipping carpet so this is the
GTX 780 ro1 for us so as part of their
DT 780 our line so notebooks using that
particular shell and is the o1 for model
and what is really cool about this one
is that lots of notebooks say they're
for gamers or for gaming and they have
really high spec and all that good stuff
but you often don't see a whole lot of
consideration for what gamers actually
need so this one takes a bit of a well
what I think is a big step forward for
notebooks and it uses a gaming keyboard
so we've seen backlit keyboards on
notebooks before but what we haven't
seen this one designed by steel series
so steel series is obviously very well
known throughout the world for their
gaming peripherals and apparently this
keyboard is good enough that they're
willing to put their name on it and
considering the fact that there are only
about four keyboards on the market right
now from steel series that they consider
good enough for their name I have very
high expectations of this one so let's
see what else MSI has to say for
themselves on the box here up to 16 gigs
of memory are supported sound is by
Dynaudio now that might sound like kind
of a gimmick sort of thing but on my GX
660 it makes a dramatic difference it's
just a higher quality overall setup than
I see on most notebooks exclusive for
ddr3 dimms okay so for up to 16 gigs we
saw that before full color backlight
keyboard for friendly gamers usage for
friendly gamers uses apparently that's
an option so I'm not sure if this one's
of course that are not interesting
dual say two hard drives with raid 0 to
double the sorry about that guys my
memory card was full ok so do all hard
drives up to raids ok raid 0 to double
the transmission speed but I'd really
recommend doing here it's throwing
SST in there and using a hard drive to
storage so that's a really cool feature
it's about an HD webcam USB 3.0 thx
another audio oriented thing and
apparently MSI is celebrating their 25th
anniversary for them all right what else
we got here free coupons inside Just
Cause two mafia 2 and the Starcraft 2
trial alright me okay so let's break the
seal here and open this bad boy up now
this is a big notebook to think about
gaming notebooks is that yeah the attend
to suffer a little bit in terms of the
weight and battery life compared to an
ultraportable or even a standard
notebook but think of it this way it's
good exercise when you're carrying it
around right yeah that's that's why you
get a gaming notebook so that you can
exercise all right so we've got a power
brick here that really looks to be about
the size of a brick so I'll pull up the
old iPhone 4 for comparison so you can
see it is quite quite large quite large
indeed there's the size from the back ok
there's power brick then there's the
battery also quite large heavy
smaller than the power brick though
surprisingly there you go all right
there for now here's those coupons
special offers from Nvidia all right
what else we got here we got some disks
some manuals driver utilities hot key
recovery options to eat some funny
booklet ok then we've got finally a
power cable to plug into power and
that's pretty much it so it's a fairly
bear package in terms of accessories but
really this notebook is about
performance and I shouldn't say a bear a
package that's not fair at all I mean it
comes with 2 3 games which I can't
really complain about right ok and the
notebook itself here we go so yeah as I
was sort of
for it's quite large here we go what's
this here got questions or problems feel
free to contact msi support okay good
good we've got a dust proof cover here
alright so there is the notebook
yourself let's take off the protector it
is using a matte screen kudos MSI for
using a matte screen on this high-end
model to be two seconds I'm gonna plug
it in alright so i've plugged it in i'm
gonna start peeling off the plastic so
we can see it and all of its HD glory
mind you I'm only gonna upload this
video in 720p because I'm not convinced
to make the difference on YouTube
there's the protector behind the
keyboard yeah it seems like a lot of
work to like make this isn't it ok
alright we've got a few different
options for languages we can go with
French Spanish or English you cannot
change your language later that's fine
country or region is not the United
States Canada alright there we are and
this will be tech tips next
all right so the setup is fairly
straightforward we're just going through
the standard Microsoft ubi so let's take
a little time and have a look at the
physical attributes of this notebook
here ok so first of all screen ok so as
I mentioned before we've got a matte
screen this is a seventeen point six
inch screen as I recall oh hold on give
me a sec guys sorry my bad that's a 17.3
inch screen this is a 1920 by 1080 Full
HD screen it comes pre-configured with
to 500 gig drives so that is one
terabyte of storage in raid zero it also
has 16 gigs of RAM and an Intel Core i7
26:30 QM quad core processor ok uses a
1.5 gig NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 mobile
and it has just a really slick look to
it can you see the the brushed finished
on the back of the notebook as well as
the shiny MSI logo here so let's look at
what we've got in terms of Io we'll
start at the back so we have an HDMI out
as well as a VGA out I actually really
liked seeing VGA out on notebooks
because so often you go somewhere where
you're not familiar with and like you
know use let's say you have to use a
projector in a restaurant or something a
lot of the time they're using older
projectors that support DGA so that's
really handy to have you've got eSATA as
well as LAN and a Kensington lock we've
got a huge exhaust vent here on the back
can you see through there to the to the
aluminum fins and the one on the other
side seems to be covered up although
maybe that's for like I don't know I
don't know what that could possibly
before on the bottom we find I have not
installed the battery yet and we have
some plastic here yeah well why don't we
show the battery installation procedure
since we haven't flipped over anywhere
should be fairly straightforward put the
thing in the thing and then lower it
into the other thing there we go lock it
down in place
alright so from here you
can see some heat pipes you can see some
RAM you can see some more heat pipes you
can see that this whole panel comes off
making upgrades quite simple now this is
an experience I've had with MSI
notebooks in the past is that you can
take the whole thing off you can replace
and upgrade the RAM and hard drives very
very easily now please note though that
the warranty is void if the sticker is
tampered with although if you have a
technician at an approved facilities
such as NCIX do the upgrade for you then
they can register that serial number
with MSI and your warranty will not be
voided all right let's have a look at
the side so here we have our two USB 3.0
ports we have an SD card reader a USB
2.0 ports and dedicated 5.1 audio port
so that's really handy to see as well in
case you wanted to plug in surround
sound to your notebook you have all the
ports that you need ok moving around to
the final side here we have two more USB
2.0 ports and a and an optical drive now
this does not have a button on it which
initially I thought was a terrible idea
but actually now looks ok because it
looks like I just have to use that
button
wha-wha-wha maybe one we're finished
booting up it'll do that ok here we go
so let's have a look at the buttons up
here ok you know what give me a sec on
the back this is kind of neat now this
notebook does come with some bloatware
but it actually gives you the option for
whether you want to install it or not so
I'm just gonna unselect everything I
don't need nevermind no I can't there's
a only magic saw music maker can I
actually uncheck so I guess I'll just
yeah
the all these magics ones I can I can
uncheck yeah ok
ok so here we are we're back everything
is pretty much installed nuance PDF
reader I don't know what your mind
seven days for that let's finish going
over the physical aspects of the
notebook so first thing here I didn't
want to oh wow okay so it's very quick
now that the driver is loaded okay so
there is a hole on the side so you can
use a paper clip or whatever if you
actually have to manually open it but
otherwise this software button seems to
be fairly responsive so I wouldn't worry
too much about that we can turn on and
off the Bluetooth there is bluetooth
included on this particular model we can
turn the wireless network on and off oh
that's kinda neat Arisa what's the
screen though okay so we turn the
wireless on and now we turned it off see
mm-hmm that's neat okay
ah Bluetooth I guess does the same thing
it's on now let's see what this button
does I apparently turned to my screen
off maybe if I press it again Oh
Oh neat okay that's actually kind of
cool so it doesn't turn it back on it
only turns it off so it's like okay I'm
stepping away from my computer boom
screen on and then if you want to turn
it back on you just move the mouse not
that that would actually be convenient
that is the kind of thing I would
actually use here we go we can adjust
brightness
no I don't know what that's for okay
well this one I know what it does this
turns the fans way up high so when
you're gaming you can be sure that your
CPU and GPU are going to run as cool as
possible the fan noise should be fairly
noticeable in a moment here don't move
the camera because otherwise they can't
keep air
now that actually doesn't get as loud as
as the GX 660 let's see what this does
cinema Pro okay so it launches Windows
Media Player apparently alright so
basically it's just a media player
lunching button okay turn off turn on oh
wait hold on
is it adjusting something about oh it's
adjusting the color of the screen okay
so it's like for movie watching mode and
then this last one over here is a
programmable button so it's set to turn
turbo on right now apparently okay sure
offender what this one did if anyone
knows what this button does let me know
okay we also have some more traditional
hotkeys built in so with the function
keys you can switch from internal to
external monitor you can turn off the
touchpad we also have a dedicated
touchpad off button here that's handy
because if you are gaming on this
particular notebook WASD is gonna put
your palm right on the touchpad if you
have a dedicated gaming mouse you're
gonna want to be using that not a
touchpad obviously so you go ahead turn
it off boom you're ready for gaming turn
it back on now you can use your touchpad
again you've got a webcam Eco mode
wireless Bluetooth sleep then we do have
a built-in number pad on this particular
notebook here so here's function keys
for brightness down and brightness up
okay guys we're back so I want to show
you guys what that button does we're
having a little bit of difficulty with
this feature right now but I do have to
finish the unboxing so I can go home and
maybe watch the rest of the hockey game
but it's for nothing already so I might
not bother basically it launches in
theory the keyboard led manager so this
gives you a bunch of different options
for how to manage the keyboard you can
control it by different zones so here in
standing okay so in gaming mode you only
light up this part of the keyboard that
seems fairly straightforward in normal
mode you can light up as many different
parts as many different colors as you
want so you could have like a rainbow
keyboard if you wanted to you can do
dual color where it'll pulsate to
different colors so you can go okay I'm
gonna have this one yellow and then it's
gonna go from yellow to purple and it
shows you a simulation of what its gonna
look like you can do a breathing effect
where it'll go darken and then turn up
you can do a wave effect hmm pretty neat
and that's pretty much it so you can
choose what you want the keyboard to do
in idle mode and what you want it to do
in standard mode as well it's not here
I'm just go ahead and let's say we
wanted to well like I said we haven't
had much success with it yet but
pressing this button at least closes the
app if nothing else the keyboard overall
I quite like the responsiveness of the
keys is excellent there's still a bit of
a bit of flex to the keyboard itself
that is to be pretty much expected on
notebooks although what I did notice is
that this part of the keyboard where
you're gonna be using it for gaming is a
little bit stronger than over here on
the number pad where it looks like not
quite as much attention has been paid
because it is a gaming keyboard so that
is not that unexpected our stereo
speakers are up here and that pretty
much covers everything I wanted to say
about the MSI gt70 ATR don't forget to
subscribe to learn effective humor
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos so I got the backlight keyboard
working before I finished up basically
what had happened was during shipping
the cable on the underside under the
panel here that powers the backlit
keyboard came loose in shipping so that
was
was what was causing my frustration with
the backlit keyboard so you can see now
that it has the three separate zones of
backlighting this button right here once
the app is loaded so we'll have to give
it a minute to load the app will allow
us to switch between all the different
completely customizable modes on this
notebook so here let's see if it works
already yep there we go
so that's gaming mode so it only lights
up the one side okay so I'm gonna press
it again and that's evidently some other
mode press it again that's the whole
thing oh I had another mode going before
okay give me a second I'll get the app
open I'll show you guys Amit
so I'm going to show you guys the
different modes now so there is dual
color mode where it'll alternate between
two different colors so you can go ahead
and you can set me we wanted to
alternate between green and purple so
it's going to show a green background
and then a purple background it'll
alternate between them you can do wave
where it'll light up one side of the
keyboard then the middle then the other
side and you can set each zone according
to whatever color you want it to be so
I'm maybe I'll set them all green like
this and now it'll do a green wave
across the keyboard very cool
okay there's also breathing mode which
will just allows only one color to be
set oh no it doesn't you can set
different colors if you want so it's
like completely user customizable let's
set this side to blue and what that does
is it has a slowly pulsating light
effect across the whole keyboard
let's go like that give you a little bit
more shade this is more like what it'll
look like in the dark actually looks
really cool and then finally there is
gaming mode which will light up only the
far left of the keyboard and this one
actually has a wider variety of color
settings so you can set more vibrant
colors or you can set more pale colors
so here so I can kind of pinks and
oranges and blues and purples and lots
and lots of different colors that you
can set you can do white as well and
then finally normal mode so you can set
it to whatever you want your normal mode
to look like so I've got it set to a
white green and orange right now and
that is what it looks like so it's a
very cool feature thank you for checking
