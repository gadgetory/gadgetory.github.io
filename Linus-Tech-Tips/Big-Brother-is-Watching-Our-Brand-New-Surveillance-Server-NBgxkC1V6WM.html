behind us I feel like it's safe to
reveal just how much of a complete joke
the security was at the old linus media
group headquarters there was a barely
functional video system remote access
that barely worked and only on Nick's
phone with no notifications not to
mention the video feeds wouldn't told us
much if anything about a would-be robber
and backing it up with some horrible
residential grade alarm system on only
some of the doors and none of the
windows these were cost-saving measures
that made sense at the time we moved
into the old house studio but no longer
do now that we've expanded to a team of
nearly ten people and are working on
stuff like our upcoming acer curved 34
inch free sink gaming monitor video
that's that's coming drop a like if
you're stoked to see that
Corsair delivers real mech or nothing
with their new strafe mechanical
keyboard featuring genuine German made
Cherry MX key switches click on this
spot right here to learn more
yeah the old office security was a bad
scene but not anymore this is our brand
spanking new surveillance server from
data cache dot CA who we chose to work
with for a number of reasons there's all
the stuff on their site they use only
top-notch hardware like this particular
trend net switch that they found is
great for poa cameras as well as the
variety of different cameras that we've
got outdoor ones you know fisheye ones
regular ones all that kind of stuff
they've got a three-year parts and labor
warranty with on-site replacement like
if something goes wrong they swap out a
new camera on the spot they have a
system to detect if one of your cameras
fails and let you know before you have
to find out and they're Canadian which
we can get like a motion track little
Canadian flag I can wave here but none
of that is actually the reason that we
ended up going with them in spite of
having offers from multiple camera and
surveillance companies data cache
whether it's the owner Phil or any of
the team members who we've worked with
there are just our kind of people make
sure you check them out at data cache CI
slash Linus if you or anyone in your
company needs video surveillance their
communication was amazingly prompt and
professional if questions answered
thoroughly sometimes too thoroughly like
long emails any time of day and if
that's not enough on their site you'll
find mention of optional CPU liquid
cooling in their machines and hot-swap
systems for the surveillance drives
these guys are bonafide enthusiasts
which is probably why you'll notice that
our surveillance server is ridiculously
enthusiast grade let's run through the
specs so they use an i star us a case
for most of their builds because while
it only supports 15 drives that's less
than the Norco RPC 4224 that we use all
the time the sleds are completely
tooless you just slide a bare drive in
and bam you've added more storage to
your surveillance system more on the WD
purple drives we're using it a bit
poking around inside the guts of our
surveillance system are also hilariously
overkill like to the point where we
could dramatically increase our camera
count down the road without any
slowdowns even when we're using you know
more intensive
features like real-time D warping of 360
degree cameras we've got a core i7 4790
quad core processor installed on a sous
z97 WS motherboard and while that's not
full server grade a Seuss's WS hardware
is built for heavy and continuous
workloads and gets more validation for
obscure hardware like the raid card that
we actually scavenged and threw in here
this is from our old server our systems
got eight gigs of ddr3 memory from
Kingston it uses a 750 watt power supply
from coolermaster although depending on
how many drives and spin up power draw
you might want to buffer on the side of
a little bit more power supply capacity
if you're actually installing all
fifteen drives we've just got nine in
here and then finally on boot drive duty
we've got not one but two of Intel's
fast and reliable 730 series SSDs
running in raid 1 so this puppy would be
pretty hard to take out with a drive
failure which leads nicely back to the
hard drives we're using I like
solid-state storage as much as anyone
but for a workload like this the
capacities not to mention the price make
it completely unsuitable so we went back
to good old-fashioned mechanical in the
form of w DS purple series of
surveillance drives unlike normal
desktop drives purple drives aside from
being specifically validated in a wide
variety of security systems feature
firmware upgrades like ata streaming
support and W DS proprietary all frame
which in a nutshell optimizes them to
handle the very unique workload of video
surveillance that is multiple many
high-definition video streams
continuously being written and then
overwritten once the drives fill up 24
hours a day seven days a week in a hot
server room environment with vibration
from other nearby equipment all of this
without dropping frames in the recording
something that was a major concern for
us because like what's the point of a
security system that runs great most of
the time and then that one clear shot of
someone's face there's a corrupted or
missing frame or something like that
which isn't to say that I would
recommend spending this much on a system
that only manages to handle recording
videos without corruption and playing
them back without revealing too much
about this
part of our new security setup because
that would be stupid
I can show you some of the cool stuff it
can do so there's a mobile app for
monitoring this works from anywhere and
can actually even stream in hi-def this
feature you're looking at is called a
missing object alarm potentially very
useful in a workshop environment for an
expensive piece of equipment that isn't
supposed to move so it can actually
trigger a notification to me or even
trigger an audible alarm if that object
isn't detected anymore this shows how
the viewfinder can be customized to show
some very different live view options so
you you can set up tiles to see a normal
view of a camera zoomed in view of a
camera with even multiple views
especially useful with fisheye lenses by
the way possible from the same camera
depending on what kind of arrangement
you want camera locations can also be
overlaid on a map of the building so you
can see indicators for where there are
people moving about and check in on what
they're doing cool here we see an
intruder alarm and showing how to find a
log of these alarms from within the
interface oh and this one is cool some
of the fancier cameras that you can hook
up to this system actually support
features like zoom and autofocus which
is as simple as just using a scroll
wheel on the mouse but this one this
last one is the killer feature that gets
me all excited like the missing object
alarm it detects something that's moved
but this one is capable of doing it
after the fact so say for example
someone enters the kitchen and moves
someone else's dishes I can quickly scan
through and see who it was yes there is
a plan to make sure people only use
their own dishes at the new office
speaking of the new office this is where
I would normally have like some kind of
a door something but not today
well sort of an ad but it's for a Linus
Media Group event on August 21st we will
be doing the first ever in-person Linus
Media Group garage sale and just general
fan meetup you guys will be able to come
out to the new office which by that time
we'll have the address listed correctly
on the Linus Media Group comm website so
it's in kind of the Cloverdale area in
Surrey and you guys
be able to come out there and meet the
crew we're expecting it to run from
around noon to sometime kind of early
evening depending on when things wrap up
we might even be doing like tours of the
inside we're gonna try and have some
snacks and drink some stuff there so
come on down and check it out August
21st 2015 if you guys are like watching
this video sometime in the future I
don't want a bunch of people showing up
on August 21st the following year
because that would be super sad
so yeah I think that's pretty much it
guys though if you dislike this video I
think you know what to do but if you
liked it hit the like button get
subscribed and even consider supporting
us whether it's with our Amazon
affiliate code just using our link you
can check here for instructions on how
to do that buying a cool t-shirt like
this one are giving us a direct monthly
contribution through the community forum
now that you're done doing all that
stuff and you guys are looking for
something else to watch you're gonna
want to watch Luke's video on the
compensator the very finest machine the
fastest we could build using
off-the-shelf parts it is quite the
showcase thanks again for watching I'll
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
