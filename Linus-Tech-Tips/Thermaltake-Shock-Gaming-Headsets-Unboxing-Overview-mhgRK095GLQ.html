is the thermal take shock gaming headset
and we'll take a look at what thermal
take has to say for themselves for
tuning what I am going to stand up I
changed my mind so we've got bass
enhancement foldable design inline
control box noise cancelling mic a
gold-plated three-and-a-half millimeter
plugs so these are all pretty standard
things except for having noise
cancelling that's that's good that's
better than sort of the most basic stuff
max input is a 100 milliwatts okay
impedance of 32 ohms which is pretty low
and you've got a 40 millimeter driver
low impedance is good by the way you
want that so that the your sound card
doesn't have to work too hard to get
things to get things going to get the
sound happening so what else they got to
say velvet ear pads headband pads soft
leather pad to release the pressure to
your head I think what they mean is
relieve pressure from your head but
that's fine ten levels of headband
adjustment to perfectly fit control box
in line okay microphone mute switch and
innovative plug-and-play headset for
true stereo sound quality I don't know
how innovative a plug-and-play headset
is but I mean there you go
so packaging wise it's pretty
straightforward it comes on a little
black thing and it comes with a little
carrying case which is nice the carrying
case is quite small as you guys may have
noticed and this is to accommodate the
fact that the headphones do fold for
easy transport which anyone who carries
their headphones around with them is
going to appreciate so you just take
them fold them up like that and then
chuck them into the little baggie where
they will be protected maybe not from
impacts but at least from unnecessary
scratches and whatnot which is great
because the headband as well as the ear
cups has a glossy finish on it that you
don't want to get all scuffed up and
scratched up and have someone make it
ugly that would be not appreciated the
earphones are clearly labeled are an lr4
reffed and light so it's gonna go this
way
now I'm just kidding right and left
that's that's what I meant to say and
I'd say if I had something that I
noticed about them right away it's the
fact that they fit me without making any
adjustments to the headband so while the
headband has ten levels of adjustment
metal headband do you like to see that
versus plastic headbands I just trust
them more I don't think they'll fit
someone with a super
small head but you shouldn't have any
difficulty for someone with a larger
head or someone with a medium-sized head
like yours truly right here
now the earcup foam is quite a hard foam
so you can see it rebounds quite quickly
and the advantage of this is that they
do we will conform to your head over
time whereas the disadvantage is they
tend to be a little bit less comfortable
right out of the box the shape of the
earphones is a little bit on the unusual
side when you see that it's a rectangle
but it's not actually that crazy because
that rectangle is kind of an ear shaped
rectangle so what I notice about them
right away is that compared to some
round headphones like for example as
much as I love my steel series 7 H's
they can put a little bit of pressure on
my earrings this one does not they're
able to sit inside there without putting
pressure on my head now speaking of
pressure on my head the headband is
about I'd say a medium thickness so that
does it distribute the weight a little
bit but what are ok medium width I
should say whereas the thickness is
quite thick so what that allows it to do
is mush out and it does actually get see
there you go now it's sort of a thicker
headband and that does make it quite
comfortable on the top of your head I
think that's not going to take very long
to break in at all compared to the
earphones themselves the boom mic can be
lowered and adjusted so you can see it
kind of sits like that
I do like retractable mics compared to
boom mics because you can position them
right at the corner of your mouth so you
don't accidentally breathe on them but
unlike one of the headphones I was
looking at earlier today this one is not
positioned such that the only way to get
it anywhere near my mouth I'd be
breathing directly on it so it's a
better fit for me personally anyway so
there's the noise cancelling mic and
then there's the microphone that is
intended to pick up your voice the
overall build quality feels quite robust
I'm pleasantly surprised the hinges
don't have a lot of flex to them so it's
you know if your ears are positioned
kind of funny then beware mine do they
have a little bit but you can see that
the hinges themselves when I really
heave on them all the movement is down
here at the bottom and these are holding
out quite nicely again this is part of
why metalhead bands inspire confidence
for me personally anyway I guess yeah
they're very open design so you're going
to be able to hear what's around you
quite
easily personally I prefer the sound of
open headphones to closed headphones but
the disadvantage for gamers is that
everyone can hear what you're listening
to and you can hear what's going on
around you so it might not be quite as
immersive but it's always nice to know
when dinner's ready anyway the cable
length is a Linus arms band which
basically means it's five and whatever
feet plus about looks like another two
and a half so it's about an eight eight
and a half foot cable on there and
you've got inline controls for your
volume up volume down and then your
microphone on and mute as well as a
little clip so you can put it somewhere
where you're not going to lose it
however that clip is made of plastic and
I don't know how long that is gonna last
thermaltake includes some documentation
with it which basically amounts to a
warranty policy as well as their
multilingual installation guidebook
however it truly is plug and play plug
and play like it's a gaming headset
you're supposed to play with it and if
you need that installation guidebook
then you're probably gonna need
installation guide books that come with
your breakfast cereal as well because
this was quite simple to install now I
have another version of the shocked this
is the shoc one and the main difference
between this one is DTS surround sound
being included on it so if you use an
analog connected head some headphone or
headset then you have to rely on your
sound card supporting some kind of a
virtual surround whereas if you use
something like this which is basically
the same thing for the most part so you
got your tte Sports Khairy bag Wow oh no
this one is different it comes with two
different sets of ear cups so you have
either the the cloth ear cups that were
included on the regular one or you have
a more plethora type of ear cup that
actually seems to have a bit of a softer
foam on it as well so these have a bit
more of a premium feel however it should
be noted that when you use a cloth ear
cup it is more breathable and it does
tend to allow more sound to be
transmitted through and then the other
main difference again these are very
very similar headphones overall
microphones the same the fit and finish
is the same well I think I quite like
these though those are much softer and
then the main difference being USB on
the other end
just like that so the sound card is
actually integrated with the headphones
on this one integrated into the control
pod so you got volume up volume down
microphone mute audio mute and then you
can lock it and unlock it Oh neat oh
cool so that'll prevent accidental
button presses and then look it has a
little light built into it that you can
turn on and off very cool and then a
much more rugged clip on this one so
that's that looks much less likely to be
accidentally damaged so DTS surround is
included it's got a USB sound card
instead of relying on your sound card so
what it comes down to is recommendation
recommend their recommendation time if
you have a good quality sound card
you're gonna want the analog connection
if you're using onboard sound get the
USB connection version because it'll
probably be better than what you're
using now thank you for checking out
