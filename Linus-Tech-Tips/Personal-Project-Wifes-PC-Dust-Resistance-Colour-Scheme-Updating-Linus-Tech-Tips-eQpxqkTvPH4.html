my wife's PC
I decided to pull out the
g1 sniper and go with
reasonable board so I'm just using a
gigabyte p67 a I'm actually changing the
CPU as well I had a 2500 K in there
before and I'm going to be putting in a
2600 K this is an ancient sample board
so this is actually using the b2 chipset
which means I can only use the SATA 3 6
gigabit per second ports without without
them eventually dying but that's fine
because I'm only using a single SSD for
the boot drive and then I say 2 optical
drive for this machine and I just the
only reason that I'm bringing this up is
because actually as we move this out of
the way it can sit over here with the
other computers that are on this shelf
that's why motherboards going on got
another one sitting over there anyway I
can go there No ok so the reason I
brought this up is because I'm going to
be reconfiguring the airflow in this
machine a little bit because it's been a
little bit problematic so you know she's
like yeah yeah I like the arc MIDI case
it's my favorite case that's what I want
my PC in but she doesn't like this big
dust thing going on here so there's a
filter on the front of the case but you
can see it accumulates quite a lot of
dust
not very attractive also I've been
having some problems with overall dust
buildup inside the case as well and what
I realized since due to the negative
airflow on the case so while the intakes
are filtered we so we can keep a lot of
the dust out that way it's still better
to maintain positive air pressure inside
the case so what I'm going to be doing
is I'm actually going to take this fan
out entirely so I'm not going to have
any intake fans whatsoever and then what
I'm going to do well okay oh sorry sorry
sorry so I'm not going to have any
intake fans in the front so that'll mean
that I won't have that that ring of dust
in the front and then what I'm going to
do is I'm going to turn all of these are
round and I'm going to use the ones at
the top and the back as intakes so what
I'm hoping that will help me achieve is
to have overall positive air pressure
inside which means that dust is less
likely to get sucked in on little cracks
in the case
and also by having all the intakes
higher up I'm hoping that less dust will
be brought in in general because it
won't be sitting right on the floor so
we'll see how this goes so the purpose
of this video was several fold so number
one was to talk about positive air
pressure a little bit with respect to
keeping dust out of your case so you
want to use filtered intakes and then
have overall positive pressure inside
the case so that it blows up little
cracks
number two was because several of you
had asked about my my wife's machine so
I figured I'd show you guys the finished
build know that it's done and number
three was if since I was taking it apart
anyway because look at this color scheme
I mean yeah yeah if you guys are
wondering why I would have downgraded
the motherboard the reason is that this
just doesn't go with the overall look of
this particular case hold on just blow
out this you can see the dust ring right
not really no okay well whatever it's
there I wish I had compressed air but I
don't I'll call that good enough okay
throw that on there and now the properly
finished build now that the color scheme
has been corrected so I've got my
special signature Linus edition RAM in
there which is blue and black and then
everything else see there's a couple
little blue accents there's some blue
accents on the heatsink of the yeah on
the heatsink so the motherboard itself
and then other than that we've got a
black and gray and white sort of
grayscale overall theme going on in here
all these are just stock parts I haven't
done anything particularly special
because let's face it it's important to
me but it's still not my machine um so
uh so yeah oh yeah so these are all
intakes and then this CPU cooler doesn't
need any kind of additional cooling
since I swapped out the g1 sniper - is
it what was it a g1 saber - something
like that yeah it's knife or - I had to
throw in a sound card so that's just an
older ah syntax sound card just because
I don't have that awesome onboard audio
anymore so go ahead and close this up oh
yeah overall
so we got a 2600 K 8 gigs of Linus
edition around P 67 gigabyte board MSI
GTX 560 hawke with the Twin Frozr 3
cooler we've got a PC power and cooling
silencer MK 3 modular power supply ocz
agility 120 gig SSD um that's a 2600 K
already I'm not sure I write Thermaltake
silver arrow heatsink and then obviously
all of that is in the fractal design arc
MIDI mid tower case there we go so it's
time to put this back and then I can
have my computer back because that is
apparently how this works when this
computer is down i forfeit the right to
use mine so thank you for checking out
