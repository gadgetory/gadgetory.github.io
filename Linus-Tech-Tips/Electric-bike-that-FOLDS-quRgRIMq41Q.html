folding ebike from rad power bikes
that's a fairly unique combination this
bike is popular among people who don't
have a lot of space to store a bike it
can fit in a boat and RV or just a
normal sized car and the fat tires and
geared hub motor mean you can take it on
rough and steep terrain so I like to
think of it as an adventurous bike let's
check it out be quiet silent wings three
uses a smooth-running six pull motor to
remain silent and cool your pc better
check them out at the link below the rad
mini arrives in a small bike box
interestingly not already folded and it
requires a bit of assembly you have to
put on the front wheel the handlebars
pedals and the optional front rack I had
a bit of trouble with it but if you
attach these two arms first you'll be
fine now that it's assembled let's try
folding it each of the folding joints
features several points of redundancy to
prevent the bike from accidentally
folding mid ride so if this lever is
loosened you'll be fine
if the whole assembly rotates away
you're still fine you have to pull this
whole contraption up before the bike
will be able to fold in half and it's
the same story with the handlebars to
fold this plastic holder needs to be
rotated this handle needs to be pulled
down and the spring-loaded part needs to
be moved now that it's folded you might
notice that the gears are exposed this
guard around the derailleur prevents
them from being damaged in transit but
it should be noted that there's nothing
to prevent the bike from scratching its
own paint so I jury-rigged a solution
out of some old bicycle tubes handy
things by the way I keep them in my car
next to the duct tape and wd-40 at 60
pounds the bike is heavier than most
folding bikes but that contributes to
its sturdy feel and I was able to carry
it comfortably especially when compared
to the 75 pound rad wagon the rear rack
can even be extended but if your bike
bags aren't very rigid they'll rub up
against the back wheel unless you bought
the optional fenders and I like how it
looks but I found no real use for the
front rack it's a weird hybrid between a
rack and two baskets with the front open
I guess to accommodate larger items but
I also would have gotten rid of these
extra railings on the sides so I could
carry a more diverse range of objects
it's also worth noting that it kind of
prevents you from parking inside most
bike racks yeah well time to start it up
the key needs to stay inserted for the
bike to run I wish this wasn't the case
since they ended up hitting my foot
while I'm riding separating the bike key
from the rest of my keys solves this
problem but it makes it easy to forget
the key in the ignition which would
allow someone to steal the expensive
battery now let's talk about the riding
experience the bike has only one
derailleur with seven speeds that's
usually fine but I wish the highest gear
was a little higher there's a backlit
LCD display which shows everything you
could ever want
except for estimated remaining range the
wimpy front light runs off the main
battery and the backlight uses doublea's
there's no suspension on the rad mini
combined with the smaller diameter tires
bumps will feel harder than usual the
fat tires definitely soak up all the
little bumps but not the big ones on the
subject of soaking you can take the rad
mini out in the rain as long as you
don't stay up for too long but my rad
mini did not come with fenders pretty
surprising since the company is located
in Seattle where it rains all winter
long I folded my bike bags over the top
of the rack to keep the water off my
back but the bike has still gotten
absolutely filthy apparently there were
no pre-existing fenders available for a
20-inch Fat Tire bicycle so rad power
bikes had to specially design and
manufacture them as of December 2016 the
fenders have finally become available
and they're great they work just as
fenders should but at 1:59 USD they're
definitely priced like custom parts
yikes the rad mini has a 556 watt hour
battery and a powerful 750 watt
planetary geared hub motor but because
of the geared motor the rad mini does
not have regenerative braking though it
makes up for this with better
acceleration than the rad wagon up to
its governor limited
top speed of 20 miles an hour however it
takes almost a second for the motor to
engage after you twist the throttle the
bike has a throttle and five modes of
pedal assist based on the cadence sensor
but the pedal assist is absolutely awful
or at least it was out of the box
basically the problem was that they
added speed limits on top of the usual
watt limits for all of the five pedal
assist modes this resulted in most of
the load being taken by either the rider
or the motor instead of being equally
distributed after I and some other users
sent rad power bikes some feedback they
reworked their firmware for the motor
controller and sent me a new one in the
mail it was a pain in the ass to install
but now the motor controller works just
the way it should and that's great but
what's not great is that my first motor
controller on the rad wagon was also
buggy and needed to be replaced so it's
become a pattern for me and looking
through online forums I'm not the only
one this is something I feel rad power
bikes could address with more stringent
pre-release testing and quality control
but let's not dwell on that what can you
expect from the rad mini with the
updated motor controller that they're
shipping now good things it turns out
due to its superior acceleration and
possibly even higher top speed when
pedaling the rad mini was able to beat
all the other electric vehicles in my
office to Costco benchmark as for range
the website claims twenty to forty miles
and the furthest I've ever gotten was
thirty which leads us to price at 1500
USD there is quite a lot of competition
from other folding ebikes such as the
Enzo or the volt bike which both come
with fenders included by the way but
despite that and any negative things
that I've said about the rad mini I
still really like it and because of its
superior acceleration and top speed more
upright sitting position wider tires and
reduced size and weights for most of my
adventures I prefer the rad Mini over
the rad wagon and the fold ability means
you can take it pretty much
anywhere just make sure to bring a tarp
so you don't get your buddy's
Lamborghini dirty ting is the mobile
carrier that is focused on customer
service and satisfaction first you can
call them and speak directly to a real
living person and with ting you only pay

the average ting bill is only $23 per
month per device if you're currently
stuck in a contract you can switch to
ting and they will cover 25% of your

it a like or a dislike get subscribed
and get bailed as well because that's a
new thing you can do I'm not sure what
it is check out our link to Amazon to
buy stuff we've also got a merch store
where you can buy a t-shirt you can't
buy this jacket check out the rad wagon
video I talked about that in this video
so if you haven't seen that you're going
to be kind of confused so goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
