these prefilled all-in-one liquid
coolers that have taken the market by
storm since the release of the ASA tech
LC LC almost seven years ago and zxt
hope so and here are their latest
entrance into this crowded category the
Krakens X 41 and X 61 with its factory
tuning and data center DNA and Intel 730
series SSD is an amazing choice for
gamers and performance enthusiasts so
let's start with a quick overview of the
similarities between these two they both
feature copper blocks with high quality
thermal compound free applied sleeved
power in and PWM compatible power pass
throughs for enough fans to handle
push-pull configurations on either the
units they also both feature an
integrated variable speed pump a key
improvement in build quality that will
help reduce the noise of the unit
compared to other solutions and they
both feature quarter inch flexible
non-porous tubing to keep them running
smoothly throughout their six year
warranty period I guess finally they
both come with NCI exes tragically not
fully square but otherwise pretty darn
good FX series 140 millimeter cooling
fans onto the part where they differ the
radiator the X 61 doesn't change much
compared to the X 60 and still has a
slim style dual 140 millimeter rad but
the X 41 got a very significant upgrade
to its thickness that should make it
perform pretty similarly to a dual 120
millimeter slim rad but with great
compatibility since it will fit in
pretty much any case that has our rear
140 millimeter cooling fan spot really
interested to see how that one turns out
other than that in the box we've got the
usual ASA tech mounting hardware the
intel flavor of which is pre applied
with AMD stuff included in the box but
that's about it for the physicality of
these coolers so let's move on to
software NZXT T's cam software was a bit
of a mixed bag for me when I first
installed the beta and it remains a bit
of a mixed bag for me now that I'm using
a non beta it's alright I guess if
you're looking for rudimentary system
information but it doesn't really do
anything that something else doesn't
already do better
there are two main tabs right now basic
and manage with NZXT intending to add
more functionality in the future basic
is available on any system and gives you
some rudimentary information about your
system some of it is useful like RAM
usage or temperature tracking over
various periods of time and
notifications if any of those monitored
parameters exceed a predefined limit but
it just still feels like it needs some
work the feature that should show me the
biggest Ram hogs on my system for
example didn't really align with task
manager CPU frequency detection seems to
be a little bit off compared to CPU Z
the advanced views charts don't work
that well on my hardware and the way it
expands and contracts just feels a
little bit clunky but the manage view
only available with supported hardware
like the new Krakens and grid plus is
where things start to get interesting I
will leave that to loot them once you
actually hook up your Kraken you'll be
able to enable it under the manage
button in the bottom right hand corner
and that's when I actually get into
things in the software that I do really
like you can monitor your pump speed you
monitor the temperatures of both your
CPU and your GPU and you can monitor the
fan speeds of your entire computer which
is pretty fantastic although in our kind
of setup not everything works 100% the
main thing is that the LED control
doesn't really work very well at all
although that's probably to do with the
fact that these are pre-production units
and I have talked to NZXT and they've
told me that these should work by the
time you guys get them and if they don't
their support will be there ready to
help you right away you can also do
stuff like set different fan profiles
which is pretty bog standard and you can
see the liquid temperature of your unit
which is pretty cool and this is
actually what pump speed is based on
this isn't a custom control pump see you
can't set it but it will change
depending on how hot the liquid is so if
your computer is running very slowly
you're not doing a ton of different
things and the liquid temperature isn't
very high the pump speed will be low and
the second you start doing something
very intensive the pump speed will go up
next up we have the graphs which I
actually found to have no problems with
even with our very pre-production setup
and the graphs are pretty cool and it's
nice to have all this information logged
although having all the settings all the
way up to a year is great but I not a
huge fan of fact that they don't have
anything under an hour I like just
seeing like a five-minute graph
maybe half an hour graph because
sometimes I'm just working on things for
a very short period of time so hopefully
implement that in the future but it's
not a huge deal on the notification side
of things which is a kind of the last
thing in this side of the software it
shows you a ton of details a little bit
too much for myself I don't necessarily
need a log of every single time I
plugged in and unplug the USB device but
it's highly customizable and you can set
it to exactly what you want so if this
was my unit I would just turn those
notifications off and keep other
notifications on like when it warned me
that prime95 was running because it was
using way too much my CPU that's kind of
nice to know if there's something in the
background that's hogging a whole bunch
of my system resources and it's going to
tell me about that that's kind of cool
the x61 did quite well beating out the
NHD 15 in our testing and the x41 did
well beating out the H 100 I this is not
super surprising as these are both 140
millimeter coolers and the X 41
particularly got a thickness boost in
this iteration of its product it's
pretty impressive in a lot of cases
these days are coming with 140
millimeters so millimeter fan slot so
I'm not super surprised that this is
starting to happen but it is quite
interesting to see the software
definitely still needs some work but
having RGB control on your cooler is
pretty cool that's a major selling point
for me we see a lot of color themed
builds now you want you be able to look
good and this can potentially make it
look good by having a color themed block
are you guys interested in this tell me
in the comments below comment on the
forum as well like dislike the video
subscribe to this channel on every other
channel we have like tech quickie and
channel super fun comment on the forum
if I already said that subscribe on the
forum because you can get rid of all the
advertisements and buy a shirt I don't
think this one's for sale yet or will be
but yeah buy a shirt thanks for watching
I'll see you guys next
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
