and 28 days after the initial console
release for rockstar to release GTA 5 on
PC wasn't worth the wait stay tuned to
find out and stay subscribed for our GTA
6 video coming in 2020 or something
Intel's new 750 series SSDs utilized the
nvme standard providing speeds never
seen before on consumer storage drives
click now to learn more I'm going to
spoil the ending a bit GTA 5 runs really
well on PC definitely better than I
actually expected but I guess that's
what we get in exchange for all those
delays the settings menu is nothing
short of glorious with a wack ton of
options and scaling available memory bar
based on the options it doesn't fail to
please the field of view settings could
definitely be better but realistically
the game wasn't designed to be played in
first-person so I don't think this was
really the end of the world the settings
under the advanced menu have the
potential to push your system very hard
and mostly don't have a massive impact
on actual gameplay view ability and what
not so I suggest not messing with this
too much unless you have a beast system
one more note on settings before we move
on and I say a above 2x can be quite
taxing on your system in the daytime
specifically be careful with this
setting because it will affect
performance quite differently depending
on the time of day in the game at night
time it's not that bad at daytime it's
really heavy
now this game's performance while great
on PC is quite variable depending on the
lighting of the scene if you're inside
or outside if it's day or night how much
stuff is going on around you
etc this game is huge and there's a ton
of different things to do which is great
in a gameplay standpoint but I don't
think they properly captured this in
their benchmark which was a little bit
more extreme than mine in both ways
resulting in theirs having a lower
minimum and higher maximum FPS and a
slightly higher average FPS than mine in
terms of performance I decided to test a
bit more than we normally do these
videos are usually just graphics cards
showdowns but you guys might want to
know a little bit more about how the
whole system will perform when under
load with GTA 5 so first off is CPU core
usage Rockstar did quite a good job
balancing the CPU usage for this game
although GTA did act a little bit oddly
when interacting with hyper threads
resulting in the client largely ignoring
them on the high end in terms of course
although it did end up using them
properly when the overall thread count
was lower resulting in a pre
b-flat performance across the board all
things considered with the dual chord no
hyper-threading setup lagging behind
slightly and the quad-core sweet spot
reigning supreme once again and finally
the graphics card performance showdown
we set our 1080p bench up with some
pretty aggressive aggressive settings
after rigging up the very high preset we
put on 2x msaa
softest shadows and took vsync off
because well it's a benchmark
unsurprisingly nvidia did quite well
this is an Nvidia title after all and it
was very apparent that both companies
saw this as an important release as they
both had dedicated GTA 5 driver releases
although it must also be noted that
AMD's driver is a beta driver so if
you're an AMD graphics user and are
planning to play GTA 5 I would suggest
grabbing that beta driver if you aren't
already a beta user it seems stable
enough in my testing so you'll probably
be fine at 1080p everything seemed to go
pretty smoothly although with the 750ti
and the 260x things did get a little bit
sketchy with stutters and some input lag
every once in a while the 4k story was
similar in terms of overall card
positioning and we ran this test in high
with softest shadows or softer shadows
no AAA and vsync off however at 4k
problems started with the 270 X and
included the 265 and 750ti and 260 x yet
again this game really doesn't seem to
enjoy running under 30fps as it
stuttered quite a bit with those cards
thanks for watching did you like the
inclusion of CPU core benchmarks would
you like to see more benchmarks like
these in gaming videos in the future
maybe like RAM usage VRAM usage overall
load on the cpu anything like that let
me know in the comments down below or
over on the forum preferably while
you're here watching this video like
this like favorite subscribe follow
