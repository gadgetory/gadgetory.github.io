brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with corsair Memory and
western digital hey guys we're here at
the AMD booth checking out some
trueaudio implementations so you're from
jen audio what does jen audio do jen
audio is a 3d audio technology company
and we're really proud to be here at the
AMD booth and really talk about our
technology and our partnership with AMD
so you had me set up on an HD oculus
which is amazing but what was what can
you describe what was happening then
sure the HC oculus is great because
you're effectively getting double the
pixels as the original oculus rift so
with our demo we're actually showing
true 3d positional audio and it's full
360 degrees around you so above your
head behind you maybe even a little bit
below and as you move around in the
world as you recall you really feel the
sound moving all around you and it's the
perfect complement to you know a VR
display like the oculus rift it's
actually pretty wild one of the main
things you notice is when you're playing
in a game you can hear things around you
mainly but when you play the the villa
demo or whatever it toscanini demo there
we go you can really tell when the
music's above you and when you go
upstairs you can really tell that the
fire is below you and the fountain is
below you and it's it's interesting
being able to get the vertical aspect to
it is this is this the first time that
we're really seeing this I you know a 3d
audio has been around for a long time
and there have been attempts to do this
sort of thing and some you know claim to
do it but I believe ours does it better
than most we're here to improve 3d audio
and really make it much better and now
that we have dedicated resources like
true audio from AMD we're able utilizes
dedicated audio hardware resources to
really you know add more resolution and
make it much much more natural it's
actually really cool it's unfortunate
that we can't let you hear it because
you're not here so there won't be a
sound demo but it is quite wild I've
heard different implementations of this
before but this one is is freakishly
accurate and when we're looking at
things like oculus rift it's it's it's
going to be complemented very severely
by everything around it so you need a
really good audio setup you need really
good peripheral setup you
really good oculus and all that kind of
stuff so it's good to see these kind of
things happening hoping that we can
spread the game sorry the message to
game developers to know that this kind
of technologies out there to really
create a better experience for their
gamers awesome thank you for watching
