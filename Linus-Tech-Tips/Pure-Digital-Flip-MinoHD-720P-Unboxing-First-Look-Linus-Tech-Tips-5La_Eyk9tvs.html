unboxing of the camera man's wallet is
is a PC brand whatever that is it's all
shiny cuz it appears to have been used a
lot now in here he has an NCIX
advantage membership card check that out
that's pretty cool he's also got some
credit cards and oh this is good
think twice so this is a good advice for
anyone who's reaching for the cards you
know and yeah so he has no money that's
why he needs to think twice between
before using his cards no I'm just
kidding that's not what I'm unboxing
today I'm gonna be having a look at the
minnow HD Flip Video camcorder so let's
get the plastic off of here first and
then we'll get a little bit further into
I'll have a look at the Box the features
all that good stuff
okay so it's got kind of a shiny / matte
box on the side it shows that it records
60 minutes of footage and it seems to
have a USB interface to your computer so
that'll make things fairly simple it is
a shoot and share in HD device you can
record it has OneTouch HD recording
instant playback and delete internal
rechargeable battery okay you can the
built-in flip share software allows you
to save organize and edit videos watch
instantly on TV and then you can share
so now it still photos from videos make
custom movies and email videos and
publish online okay that's cool so I'll
publish online so you can upload your
videos directly to myspace or YouTube
this is probably the more relevant one
okay this says the same thing so why
don't we break the seals and have a look
at what is inside oh now I'm wrecking
the box okay so the first thing we will
find is a black box okay so the unboxing
continues and hopefully this doesn't end
up like one of those Russian dolls where
it's like just taking one box out of
another box
okay so minnow HD whoo okay they get
like a plus four presentation here this
is kind of like opening an iPhone or
another sort of high-end electronic
device which it is high-end electronic
device okay so why don't we have a look
at the accessories that are included
first this
the damaja or a bead or a QuickStart
guide in French let's ignore the French
one and look at the English one there it
is so it is get started camcorder
features so it's got a power button
restaurant hook tripod mount even okay
lens recording light microphone USB
latch she was the arm play button lots
of buttons
ok well we'll have a look at all the
buttons when we actually get the unit
out it uses a sealed rechargeable
battery ok save edit and share connect
to your computer ok well oh this is
interesting so it has um yellow red
white composite output just right from
the device so that's pretty neat
ok here we have a warranty card which
explains the warranty which is this is
not a toy never allow children to play
the camcorder I do not see how long the
warranty is but I'm sure that you can't
ninety days ok so it has a 90 day
warranty hmm ok let's see what else do
you have in here so there's a little
shiny shiny silver wrist strap very nice
and then we have a little baggie that's
made of very soft material to store the
slip in and then on the other side okay
so it even includes the composite cable
that's pretty nice ok so we can put that
back in there ok so why don't we have a
look at the unit itself so first of all
let's get this blue plastic tab lifted
up here there we go so the Flip HD just
like that so there is our lens and let's
see you know what I'm actually gonna get
that QuickStart guide out so that it can
guide me through what everything on here
is so first of all this is the power
button second of all this is the wrist
strap hook so that's where you hook up
your your shiny silver wrist strap
alright number three is the tripod mount
which is on the bottom
oh I even oh it's too bad I have a
little tripod that would fit that if I'd
known I'd have grabbed it so I could
show you there is the lens right inside
there 5 is your recording light which is
around here somewhere
then six is your mic and then the USB
latch this I'm interested in so you pray
oh look at that I guess that's the flip
part so oh that's kind of cool so there
you go so you put it in like that so you
hold you press this little button and
bam oh it comes just like that
and then you put it back in and it folds
oh that's pretty neat okay so what else
do we have on here there's your TV out
and then there is uh see you can see if
I can power down with the power button
oh that's too bad it doesn't come
charged oh well there's your record
button there is your back and forward
these seem to be touch sensitive buttons
which is pretty neat there's play
there's twelve what is that
that's the delete button right there
okay alone is play thirteen is record
yep okay up down oh this is good okay so
the UP button this is what you touch to
zoom and then this one you touch to zoom
out while you're paused you can touch to
skip to the previous video here or in
during playback you can touch and hold
to rewind so similar for the forward one
so the the controls are actually pretty
pretty good I'd love to be able to show
you the screen but I guess we'll have to
charge it before we can do that okay
well thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the Flip HD and I hope you
enjoyed it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
