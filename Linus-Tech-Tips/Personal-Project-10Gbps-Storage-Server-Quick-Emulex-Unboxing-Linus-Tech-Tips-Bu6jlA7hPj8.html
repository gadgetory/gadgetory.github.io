excited about something that comes in a
plain brown box and doesn't save
Republic of gamers all over it but this
is the OCE one one one zero two NX this
is a direct-attached copper ten gigabit
per second Ethernet adapter so it has
sfp+ connectors on it two ports PCI
Express 4x I believe comes with in some
stuff inside ok so what's special about
these these are the least expensive 10
gigabit per second capable adapters that
are out there
well Linus why would you care about that
because you know 10 gigabit per second
switches are uber expensive comes with a
low-profile adapter comes with two low
profile adapters I think one of these
ended up I have a few of them so I mean
one of them didn't have one so I think
they just come with one so yeah 10
gigabit per second switches were so
expensive line this why could it even
matter to me the consumer that I can get
a 10 gigabit ethernet card for under 300
bucks well the answer I would reply is
daisy-chaining
these adapters and there are other ones
too I actually bought the wrong ones I
didn't want the sfp+ ones it was my bad
there's a different part number that can
do 10 gigabit per second over cat 6 and
cat 6a which is just regular rj45
connector well sort of regular I think
they've made some revisions but the
point is much less expensive than direct
attached copper cables which will run
anywhere from about 50 to a couple
hundred bucks depending on the length
but they can go up to 40 feet and right
so there's cat 6 cat 6a ones there's
these SFP+ ones why am i excited about
this because daisy-chaining
so they have two ports on them which
means if you wanted to have sort of out
here I drew a little diagram where's my
little diagram ah yes this is my plan
that I've been working on for a while so
this is my server with the quad gigabit
NIC okay so server right there and then
it's sort of one gigabit out to
everywhere else from there then that
server could also have one of these bad
boys and that I then run regular cat 6
to 2 other computers
a capture computer and a video editing
computer so I'm going to show you guys
why this is so exciting in just a moment
sorry guys baby sleeping but here's the
config I'm using just for testing so
there's one of the Emulex cards and I've
got a direct attached copper cable
running down to another Emulex card so
that's a 10 gigabit NIC here and that's
my quad one gigabit NIC here so this
machine right here will have to have
some network configuration done to allow
this network to talk to this network so
that these computers can all talk to
this at one gig and these computers can
talk to these ones at one gig but that
all the daisy chains 10 gig computers
will be able to do that now if you had a
switch that would be better any switch
with an SFP+ sorry about that any switch
with an sfp+ set of connectors on it
will work for direct-attached copper as
far as I can tell that I could be wrong
about that one but here we go
so guys right now everything's pretty
ghetto I just have the two cards
directly attached to each other so you
can see it's working here 10 gigabit per
second if we go ahead and look at the
status of the connection there it is 10
gigabit per second no internet access
because like I said they're just direct
attached but check this out okay so why
do I need this a couple things number
one here check this out uber file MOV
this is a five minute media file that is
36 gigs for video work you want to work
with uncompressed whenever you can which
means I want to capture uncompressed
from the camera to my black magic card
then I want to work with that
uncompressed footage and that is very
very bandwidth intensive we've tried to
do it on gigabit it's not even close so
check this out I can play this file back
over the network no big deal so there
it's me talking about some thing let me
just move this off to the side of what
you guys to see this network usage you
can see here that single gigabit would
not have been anywhere near enough this
needs at peak like if I'm scrubbing
through the file it's going to go up
around 40% utilization on
ten gigabit per second connection
alright so the other thing about 10-gig
is that you have to have the horses on
the other side to take advantage of it
so my storage server here with the arica
raid card oops yeah you guys can't see
that with the arica raid card has eight
Seagate three terabyte drives in those
bottom eight bays so they are capable of
producing up to 700 megabytes per second
sustained reads and 500 megabytes per
second sustained right so that's way
more than gigabit Giga bits only about a
hundred megabytes per second reads and
writes so right so yeah so the 10
gigabit per second connection wouldn't
do me any good unless the storage on the
other side was good enough to keep up
with it so here I'm going to do a quick
demo where I'm going to take a few video
files let's say totalling about and I
don't know let's go for a risk go for
around 5 gigs here guys what do we got
here
yeah there we go five point three five
gigs and we're going to copy these to
the desktop here check this out you guys
are going to love this so you can see
here it Peaks around 1.2 gigabytes per
second which is freaking unreal and then
we start to be limited not by the this
guy on the other side here because that
was all like caching and memory and all
that but we're limited actually by the
write speeds of the SSD in the rendering
machine which is here so guys what's
exciting about this is that for about so
each card is about 280 bucks on NCIX for
these Emulex cards whether you get the
direct attached copper ones or the cat6
cat6a ones which means you can build a
three computer gigabit 10 gigabit daisy
chain for like 750 bucks plus cables so
less than a thousand bucks you can get
these kinds of speeds now for a general
consumer watching your blu-ray rips yeah
not that useful but if you don't want to
spend several thousand dollars on a
switch invest in you know $700 cards
plus you know 800 $700 sfp+ fiber
modules blah blah blah and spend you
know five to ten grand
setting up the ten game bit per second
connection
if you have a use for one whether it's
for like prosumer video editing or
whatever else this is actually very
attainable thanks for checking out this

gigabit per second connection experiment
