courage to do what no one else does the
courage of our convictions to solder
everything down courage to remove
features pushing your willingness to pay
more for less but sometimes sometimes
they falter sometimes innovation rears
its ugly head and today we have the iMac
Pro the upgradable iMac the workstation
iMac the Mac for legitimate creative
professionals who saw that one coming
today's video is brought to you by us
check out the ltte merch store at the
link in the video description we've got
shirts mugs hat stickers and more so the
base 8 core configuration of the iMac
Pro is four thousand nine hundred and
ninety nine US dollars
let's take you for a tour then and break
down what you get for that money and how
that would compare to buying components
off the shelf the most obvious feature
of any AIO is the LCD spec wise there's
really not much out there like it with
LG's ultra fine 5k being the closest
analogue with P three wide gamut color
support 500 nits maximum brightness
Thunderbolt 3 input and a $1,700 price
tag moving under the hood the next most
expensive component is an 8 core Intel
Xeon w21 40 be a slightly down clocked
version of the Xeon w21 45 that can be
swapped out for up to a Xeon w21 95 18
core for very heavy workloads now with
the Xeon comes ECC or error correcting
memory and even our base model has a
healthy 32 gigs of it interestingly
unlike previous 5k IMAX the pro is using
full-sized dims rather than sodium's
theoretically great news for upgraders
but alas Apple giveth and Apple taketh
away to take full advantage of the
Zeon's quad channel memory controller
all four of the iMac pro slots are
populated and there is no access hatch
on the back a little bit more on that
later
one of the most underwhelming aspects of
the base iMac Pro is probably the GPU of
Vega 56 I mean it's not terrible but
considering that previous Mac Pros used
fire pros rather than consumer cards and
the price point you might reasonably
expect better and the same could be said
for the upgrade options your GPU is
soldered directly to the motherboard so
the only way to max it out with the
marginally faster Vega 64 is to pay up
front
AMD's full MSRP
for a standalone card on top of what you
already paid theoretically for a Vega 56
thanks cryptocurrency miners so bottom
line with a comparable motherboard
equivalent 10 gigabit networking a
terabyte of very fast PCI Express
storage a power supply a case cooling
and some decent peripherals the Apple
tax on this particular model even
ignoring that computers do not assemble
themselves and that ongoing software
support and warranty coverage both have
a value is a whopping negative $200 so
why is it that Apple has this reputation
for having overpriced computers we're
gonna get to that first let's talk about
the experience of using the iMac Pro it
is essentially identical to that of our
regular iMac the display is gorgeously
retina and very bright but with fat
bezels and no HDR support for reasons
that likely have everything to do with
supply chain and nothing to do with
courage it D clutters your life with
only a single cable needed for power as
long as you don't need to plug anything
into one of the conveniently located USB
3 or Thunderbolt 3 ports at the back and
the included wireless peripherals are
more than usable ranging from pretty
darn good for a low-profile chiclet
style at least it has a numpad 2 the
built-in touch pad is really cool for
gestures but how have they not fixed
this charging port yet really similar
except for one big difference the iMac
pro uses workstation class and modern
hardware something you can't take for
granted so you'd probably think then
that tools like Logic Pro and Final Cut
Pro that have been tuned for years for
outdated mainstream or mobile CPUs would
run like billy-o on this thing and you'd
be right this is the fastest Mac ever
built in every respect you kind of have
to feel it to believe how quick and
responsive it is across the board
Safari launches instantly even at 5k
desktop animations never drop a frame
and even Adobe Premiere as much of a dog
as it can be
launches every bit as quickly as the
fastest test benches we've ever built
oh and also 10 Gigabit Ethernet means
that the iMac Pro is a real Mac that is
finally able to work with large files
and networked resources right out of the
box something that is essential to our
production workflow where we keep all of
our footage on a redundant protected
high-speed storage device on the network
as for how well it performs elsewhere
well it should come as no surprise that
it tears through most of our
professional tests with relative ease
Cinebench scores landed about where they
should lux mark spat out some very
respectable numbers and blender ran very
well
except when it didn't we're kind of
hoping that the performance issues with
blenders cycles render are just growing
pains that will be dealt with in short
order
with all those rosy results in mind
though it should be noted that the Zeon
W didn't quite match the performance of
our similar C on W or our similarly
priced desktop grade core I 9 and that
even our base model CPU throttled under
sustained loads with the imac pro's
cooling system staying in audibly quiet
rather than holding the cpu temperatures
at a more comfortable 70 to 80 degrees
we'd like to see Apple ramped up the fan
more aggressively though with that said
given the placement of the exhaust with
air basically being blown back into the
intake anyway it's kind of hard to tell
how much it would help and what we also
don't know at this time is how a higher
spec CPU would affect any of this let's
get back to that discussion about
upgradability now Apple may officially
void your warranty and getting inside
the iMac Pro is a real chore but it
appears as though the CPU RAM and
proprietary SSDs there are two of them
running in raid zero could all be
swapped out for compatible replacements
so this is something that we plan to
explore in a follow up video bottom line
then it feels like Apple is finally
listening to its professional users
there are a few things missing maybe
kind of like the Soviets after the 1969
moon landing they've decided to just let
Microsoft have it as the only one with a
sexy AIO with a digitizer by leaving out
support for the Apple pencil but they
gave us 10 gig Ethernet and truly
professional-grade performance and they
did it in a form factor with a level of
polish that nobody does quite like Apple
so thermals aside I guess it's pretty
magical and our major gripes that are
really just the usual stuff about the
restrictive Niseko system in general
one without any obvious reason the iMac
Pro doesn't support target display mode
which would allow you to get more
mileage out of it as a monitor once the
internals become outdated - other than
Thunderbolt 3 there is no way to add an
expansion card in spite of the CPUs
massive 48 PCIe lanes and three while on
paper the specs and pricing actually
look really attractive compared to an
apples to apples DIY solution a big part
of the reason for that is Apple's manner
of choosing expensive options that not
everyone would necessarily spring for if
given the choice better performance per
dollar can be achieved with some
compromises in a DIY box now it's
possible that when the true standalone
workstations arrive perhaps later in
2018 that will see some more flexibility
here nvidia gpus anyone they've got
drivers but i wouldn't hold my breath
