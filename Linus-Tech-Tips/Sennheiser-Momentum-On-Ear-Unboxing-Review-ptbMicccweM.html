items for planetside 2 click now to
learn more so let's go back to my
original unboxing of the Momentum's for
a moment I called them fashion
headphones and I meant that in the most
derogatory possible sense and I was
wrong honestly it's a miracle Sennheiser
talks to me at all at this point I used
a very flawed testing methodology we all
learned I suppose I only had about an
hour with them so they weren't properly
broken in and I was using what must be
one of the worst audio sources in the
world which is the HTC One with the
stock media player that comes with it I
had recently switched from the iPhone 4
to this one and I had no reason at the
time to assume that this one would be so
terrible but I blamed it on the
headphones and I was incorrect to do so
so like I said miracle of miracles
Sennheiser reached out to me about their
newer momentum ski which at the time I
didn't realize was different and that
was less expensive and asked me to maybe
take another crack at the momentum
series so this my friends is the
momentum on-ear it is available in a
variety of different colors from blue to
green to ivory to pink it uses an on-ear
style so that is to say it is
supra-aural and sits directly on your
earlobe as opposed to around your ears
sealing against your head and uses all
Cantara materials instead of leather so
this is still considered a premium
material but obviously not to the same
degree that leather is and that's
present on both the ear pads as well as
the top of the head band in terms of
accessories we see some costing down
here as well so the hard carry case that
came with the original Momentum's is
replaced by a soft fabric carry case
that honestly isn't particularly rugged
but it does have stiff boards in the
front and the back so I wouldn't expect
your headphones to get completely
destroyed sitting inside them it's
rugged enough for what you're putting
inside them it comes with a couple of
different cables so and one of them is
just a straight connector cable so this
locking connector goes into the bottom
of the headphones here and then there's
a plain three pole that goes into your
media player and then it also comes with
an alternative 4-pole connector so this
one is a right angle connector and can
be used to control
Audio on an iOS compatible device so you
can control volume up and down you can
skip tracks you can pause and play
tracks and all that kind of good stuff
it also comes with a little carry peg
bag that has a drawstring you can put it
in this and then inside the hardshell or
you can just chuck it in this and throw
it in your bag which is what I think a
lot of people are more likely to do just
because portability is key it's called
momentum build quality hasn't been
degraded from the original Momentum's
every stitch is perfect it's got
gorgeous little color shifting
Sennheiser logos on either side little
momentum badges that are perfectly
attached and none of none of it comes
apart it's screwed together so they use
little torque screws on the inside of
the headband to hold everything together
and it really does feel in spite of the
thinness of the metal used and the
lightweightness of the whole thing very
very solid I even I mean it's even
little things like they put holes in the
metal aside from the ones that slide in
order to adjust the ear cups presumably
just to reduce weight now let's get into
the somewhat tricky part a bit of a
sticking point for these for me and
that's fit and comfort out of the box
within about ten to fifteen minutes my
ears would be so tender that I could
barely press on them like this I don't
tolerate super aural headphones very
well and these were not any kind of
exception with that said the Alcantara
material breathes extremely well and
they're quite comfortable in that sense
so and they sound really great so I
wanted to give them a chance after a
couple weeks they're quote-unquote
special foam don't call it memory foam
so I don't know what kind of foam it is
but it's special foam that's what that's
what they call it I'm after a couple
weeks it did start to break in it is
springier than your typical memory foam
so I kind of saw that I went shoot these
are going to be putting a lot of
pressure on me at the start but maybe
maybe they'll break in and they did and
this isn't the first time I've had that
experience with Sennheiser my HD 5 v 5s
fit like a glove now they sucked when I
first got them the clamping force was
way too tight and that is something that
you can adjust quite easily with the
momentum on years due to the metal
construction of the headband the
headband itself actually speaking of
which is not really my favorite design
either the original Momentum's
are a little bit cushiony er but both of
them are quite hard it's these two
somewhat hard material bands across your
head and I did find myself rather than
wearing them in a more natural position
which would be closer to the crown I did
find myself shifting them forward a
little bit to get the weight
distribution better which feels a little
bit more unnatural for me but did
improve the comfort dramatically now
that I've had them well over a month I'm
able to easily wear them for a couple
hours without them being uncomfortable
so guys if you do decide to buy them buy
them from a place with a great return
policy that's like 14 days or 30 days
spend a bunch of time with them and find
out if they're going to be okay for you
in the longer term remember I'm a bit of
an you know outside sort of scenario I
wear earrings all the time and that
really doesn't help with super aural
headphones now it's into listening time
I validated with the on ears as well
that that stock HTC one player makes
them sound like junk there are alternate
solutions out there so power amp is one
that's quite popular because it does
have a graphical EQ however EQ is not
the be-all and end-all of making music
sound better just it just isn't and I've
discovered since then that Apollo is a
fantastic little music player however
it's not on the Play Store anymore so
you will have to run out and look for it
but I can no longer tell the difference
between the output from my HTC one and
the one from my iPhone 4 now I can't
really apologize for this because I am
what I am I didn't listen to classical
music with it I'm a top 40 listener
it's terribly mastered it's you know
compressed it's this it's that all that
stuff I'm sorry but I am what I am and I
believe that I'll be using these the
same way that most people who buy
something like this will be using them I
plugged it into my phone and I listened
to the kind of music I listened to and
honestly I loved them I actually liked
the sound of the on ears better than the
original Momentum's and I'm not quite
sure why it is but it may have something
to do with the fact that the original
Momentum's don't feel quite right at the
bottoms of my ears and that is an
advantage of the super aural design it
does allow them to seal against your
ears very very effectively even if that
does cause some discomfort at the
beginning so this leaves us with final
thoughts you know what if you want
something portable that looks good the
momentum on ears are definitely worth a
look
compared to
other fashion headphones they sound
dramatically better than other ones I've
heard and I'm not saying you know I'm
not even going to say beats are terrible
because if you believe beats are
terrible you already know that you
believe that and if you don't believe
they're terrible you already know that
too so all I'm going to say is give
something else a try go somewhere and
try the original Momentum's if you have
a bit of a bigger budget or try the
momentum on ears if you don't mind the
super aural design or you have a bit of
a lower budget just give it a try
because they sound so much better than
many of the other solutions out there
with respect to fashion headphones with
that said you know are they the best
value in the world maybe not someone
like someone I am lover like one of our
employees here ed Zell is going to say
well there's better values out there
they're even less bulky they sound
better they cost less yes
IEM exists we're aware of this for the
same price as sort of in the same price
range as these Momentum's you can get
Sennheiser ie8 which undeniably sound
better but not everyone likes sticking
things into their ears and some people
like their headphones to be a fashion
accessory which leads us to yes there
are better values when it comes to over
the ear headphones as well but a lot of
the time they don't have that same look
and they don't have that same
portability that's something like a
momentum SKU does not everyone wants to
sit around on the bus with huge you know
studio monitor cans on their ears and
while some people will do it not
everyone's into that so if you're
looking for a fashion statement
from a knowledgeable company that
actually knows a thing or two about
audio consider the momentum on years
give them a try that's all I can really
say about them I really liked them leave
a comment with your feedback what do you
prefer would you rather have IEMs you
know they're going to sound great
they're going to be a great value would
you rather have you know over the year
large cans and just wear those out in
public at your desk wherever you happen
to be or do you prefer a different pair
of headphones for different purposes and
would you be a fashion headphone buyer
let me know what you think liked the
video if you liked it dislike it if you
disliked it and leave a comment with the
thing I said before about commenting and
