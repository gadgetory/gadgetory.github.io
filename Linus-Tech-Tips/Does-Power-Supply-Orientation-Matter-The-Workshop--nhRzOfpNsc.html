going to be checking out power supply
positioning we've put a bunch of stuff
over the years with case feet do this
without case feet do that with a
basement do this turn the fan so it's
facing up into the case it's going to
help cool your graphics card and all
this other member jumbo so let's try it
out we're going to do a bunch of
different scenarios we have a case that
has a basement in it and we're going to
have the fan going up and down clear
winner here is probably obvious but
anyways without a basement we will do
the power supply fan up and down and
with a reference rear exhaust cool
graphics card and with an internal
exhaust graphics card we're also going
to take system temperatures and GPU
temperatures and power supply
temperatures and ambient temperatures
and thermometers everywhere let's get
started
gee fuel is the sugar free alternative
energy beverage to maintain focus and
endurance in long days and gaming
sessions save some money with our offer
code at the link below so our first test
has the power supply in the bottom
facing down so the fan is pulling up
from under the case and exhausting out
the back this should not contribute to
the system's temperature at all but I
want it for like initial tests anyways
for the rest of the system I have a 390
X naught overclocked but running the
Crysis 3 skybox test which would be
putting stress on it and the CPU which
is running on top of a hyper 212 Evo the
CPU here is a 4790k which is overclocked
at one point 3 5 volts so it should be
generating some heat as well and with an
air cooler instead of a water cooler it
should actually be dumping heat into the
rest of the system too so this is a
pretty hot air environment so now that
we're good to go we're going to wait 10
minutes so everything can heat up ok so
the first test is done our ambient
outside of the case right now looks like
it's about 25.4 I'm going to take this
off of the front which is our thermal
probe and then hopefully I can read an
ambient temperature inside of the case
looks like it's about 41 and a half so
that's actually quite hot inside of the
case so just checking the numbers now it
looks like the power spot is running at
thirty two point five degrees Celsius at
an RPM of about 530 give or take a
little bit the graphics card was running
at about 87 degrees Celsius and the CPU
was running at about 74 degrees 72
degrees Celsius now we're going to try
it with the power supply fan pointing up
into the case but remember there is that
basement panel there so I don't really
expect this is going to go too well but
we'll check out the numbers in ten
minutes okay so the second test is done
the outside temperature is at 25 point
five degrees okay and then the
temperature inside the case is looking
like again it's right at about forty one
point five we're getting the same
temperature which is pretty much what I
expected because the thermal zone in the
bottom where the power supply is is
isolated so turning it around shouldn't
actually change anything we're just
making sure that it doesn't
okay so check out the power supply first
it looks like it's about 40 degrees
Celsius and we're laying in a fan rpm of
640 which is considerably higher than
the 530 from before our GPU temperature
during the test was sitting at right
about 89 degrees consistently throw the
entire thing and then the CPU was
running at about 67 degrees so really
the GPU and CPU had no change overall so
we have now moved the system to the
define our five I took the mod you vents
off the top so that it can breathe up
there a little bit the fans are all
plugged in and we are now taking the
ambient temperature of the room from the
side of the case because we like taking
that right where the case is in taking
air so we're taking it from the side
because the front is a solid block the
first test that we're going to be doing
in here is the power supply pulling air
in from the bottom and exhausting it out
to the back with an internal exhaust GPU
so a pretty standard set up the
temperature going into the case in terms
of room ambience is at about twenty five
point seven degrees and then the
temperature inside the system in terms
of ambience is about 42 degrees which is
actually pretty damn hot now we move on
to the software stuff we get to see that
our power supply is running at about 584
rpm at a temperature of 35 degrees
Celsius our CPU is running at about what
looks like 67 degrees which is on par
with what it was doing before and our
GPU temperature is actually pretty hot
at 94 degrees throughout the main
testing area so now things get
interesting we're in the same case same
graphics card setup internal exhaust
same tests all that kind of stuff but
now the power supply has its fan pointed
upwards some people say that this can
help your Jeep use thermals or your
system thermals as it pulls air out and
then out the back of the power supply
and the power supplies temperatures will
be fine anyway so we'll see if it
actually does that done
okay so for that test the room
temperature was at about twenty five
point eight degrees the system
temperature we will grab right now yeah
that's 42 degrees so basically no
difference at all so the CPU is more or
less at about 67 degrees there's quite a
bit of Spike eNOS here also the GPU is
still at 94 degrees Celsius now
scrolling down to look at the core clock
to see any differences there it is also
about the same is at about 10:40 in
terms of core clock so it's not running
at 94 degrees but a little bit faster a
little bit slower it's just it's doing
the same thing but the power supply was
a bit hotter so time to investigate more
alright we have now removed our internal
exhaust Strix 390x
so I put in a 290 which should kind of
you know take a little bit more power
and probably cause a little bit more
thermal destruction to the inside of the
case so now 10 more minutes and we'll
see how a rear exhaust card and a fan
pointing upwards from the power supply
manages to cool the whole system the
temperature in the room right now is
about 26 degrees
looks like our overall system
temperature is way lower sitting at
about 29 degrees the power supply is
running at 36 point five degrees with a
fan RPM of 536 so the power supply is
not even pushing that hard the GPU
before I opened Snagit was running at
about 94 degrees Celsius with a clock
speed of around mid 600's to mid 7os
and then our CPU is sitting at about 62
degrees Celsius okay so the last test is
running right now the skybox test is on
the screen the rear exhaust card is
installed and the fan on the graphics
card is oriented pointing downwards so
we'll see you in ten minutes okay so the
temperature in the room is a solid
twenty five point eight degrees okay and
then the temperature in the system is at
about twenty nine twenty eight point
nine twenty nine point one degrees which
is more or less what it was before so
the internal temperature
is the same power supply numbers it's a
second okay so it's running at 41
degrees Celsius but the fan isn't even
spinning so it's not really trying that
hard the graphics card is running a core
clock of so it's 700 and something to
600 in something and the temperature is
about 94 degrees there's no real
difference there and the CPU is running
at about yeah 62 just before people
asked for additional information the fan
speed on both the graphics cards were
both pinned at 45 percent so those
should not have been changing and the
fans throughout the system on both cases
were pinned but I did use different fans
again the system temperature and whatnot
between the two shouldn't even really be
compared to the different cases using
different fans whatever just isolate
those tests so the information here is
interesting and there's actually a few
different results that you can come to
depending on what scenario and what case
type that you have so I'm hoping that
these results are interesting to you
some of them are fairly obvious like if
you have a basement in your case don't
point the fan towards the like roof of
the basement where it can't breathe at
all yeah the ones where it's like an
internal exhaust graphics card it didn't
really seem to help the graphics card
which is what I was kind of hoping for
and it did increase the heat of the
power spike one interesting thing that
we did notice was with rear exhaust
graphics cards if the power supply had
its fan turned up into the case it
actually did perform better in terms of
the power supplies temperature nothing
else not the system not the graphics
card not the CPU
nothing but the power supplies I'm
assuming that's because there's air
coming in through the front of the case
that's fresh and nice and cold and is
being pushed over top of the power
supply and then out the back so it's
able to breathe fresh nice cold air but
what we did learn today is that it's not
that big of a deal which is a very
unfortunate and consistent conclusion of
the workshop but there is different
results per test and it's mainly based
around the temperature of the power
supply so while we're still definitely
within what's safe for a power supply to
run at you might be
to change your orientation or do
something slightly different in order to
fine-tune things because a zero overall
impact in terms of your graphics cards
performance and temperatures and
whatever and saving a fairly noticeable
amount of degrees on your power supply
might not be a bad idea in terms of
overall longevity if you guys want to
test it out and try it with your own
graphics cards in your own systems with
different setups and all that kind of
stuff do it check it out on the forum
