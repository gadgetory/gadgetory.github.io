is not exactly a new one and the idea
behind it is pretty simple if you have
more system memory than your
applications require you can use
software to allocate some of it to make
a lightning-fast storage device that
your system sees exactly the same way it
would any other standard hard drive or
solid-state drive meaning you could use
it for anything sounds cool right well
we do lots of cool stuff on this channel
we've even got a razor siren review
coming soon so stay tuned for that but
for now roll the intro then we'll tell
you more cooler masters casemod world

pretty much anyone hears about Ram
drives their mind starts buzzing with
ideas like oh snap I could put my
operating system on it or like I'm gonna
put all my games on it so I'll be the
first one to the Hellion battlefield but
life is never that simple is it system
memory is usually at least an order of
magnitude more expensive than even
high-end storage drives so those multi
gig application and game installs get
really expensive real fast and even if
you did want to buy as much RAM as you
can fit in your motherboard unless
you're buying a server grade board that
won't be as much as you might hope and
the list of disadvantages actually keeps
on trucking here RAM is what is known as
volatile storage which means every time
the system powers off it empties that
means that most Ram disk utilities need
to essentially recreate the drive when
they're launched and every time you boot
the drive needs to be refilled with
whatever you want to store on it from a
reserved spot on your system Drive a
process that is bottlenecked by the
aforementioned system drive and can
therefore be quite slow then if you
update anything while using the RAM
drive it will need to commit those
changes back to your system drive when
you shut down by dumping them from the
RAM disk and then of course if the
system shuts down unexpectedly then
you're in for a real problem
because any change is not committed like
a savegame or a file are just gone but
in spite of all those challenges many
performance enthusiasts and gamers
remain committed to trying to make RAM
drives as practical as they can be and
one such enthusiast at startup Tim on
Twitter thinks he's finally done it at
least for gamers with a product called
dim Drive now to be clear the underlying
technology is exactly the same here
there's no voodoo magic but the claims
that dim drive makes about simplifying
the process and optimizing the
application itself for gamers intrigued
me so I got on the phone with Coursera
had them send me a 32 gig kit at their
vengeance lpx ddr4 24 hundred megahertz
round which Iran in quad-channel
on an Asus x99 AWS motherboard free
basically as good as it could possibly
get scenario for dim Drive to really
prove to me if it's worth the money so
first a quick tour of the product though
on the main screen is an auto populated
list of the Steam games that you have
installed the star allows you to easily
sort whichever ones you want to the top
the size shows you how much RAM you'll
need to cash that game the wrench to the
far right lets you choose whether to
auto load that game and whether to
enable real-time file synchronization
which should knock on wood protect you
from progress loss in an unexpected
shutdown scenario and a less Ram option
to show dim drive where the important
files are to cache for this title so you
can boost performance potentially
without caching the entire game and
therefore getting a little bit more
mileage out of your realm
finally the slider next to the wrench
tells that game whether to cash or not
in the apps tab you can add non Steam
games or any other applications you want
by manually dragging them onto the
window or right clicking and clicking
Add then the settings tab lets you
configure your drive letter the size of
your dim drive your startup options and
your color scheme finally at the very
top of the window is the master slider
to turn dim drive on and off and I'll
give this to Tim this is a lot simpler
to configure than ramdisk software that
i've used in the past but even if it
works as intended
is a ramdisk really a sensible upgrade
for gamers storage speed is
well-documented as having literally zero
impact on your FPS so the thing to look
at then is loading times we ran four
different scenarios a one terabyte 7200
rpm WD black hard drive a one terabyte
Samsung 850 Pro SSD that same SSD with
Samsung's rapid Ram cache enabled we
needed to show several results for this
one by the way to show how it learns
over time and finally dim drive with the
full game loaded into memory and this
conclusion probably won't surprise
anyone who has fooled around with RAM
drives before but it was still an
interesting experiment for me to run and
make a video about since I wanted to
play around with the software anyway I
really think that dim drive has made
enormous strides towards making RAM
drives easier to use but that doesn't
change that the most compelling storage
type for an enthusiast pc or gaming PC
is still an SSD it's only a few times
more expensive than a hard drive and
makes your entire system much more
responsive not just game or application
loading times and it costs about 1/10
what you'd spend per gig to put your
games in RAM every time you boot up now
if dim Drive was like 10 bucks and
you're the kind of person who really
only plays one or two games and enjoys
being the you know the first one to the
heli like I said before then it would
actually get a pretty strong
recommendation at $30.00 though it's a
little too much for me to buy for
personal use though speaking of things
that cost too much razors but
fortunately today's episode sponsor
Dollar Shave Club has got that shiz
taken care of for you all you've got to
do is for a very affordable monthly fee
sign up for Dollar Shave Club and they
will ship you razors and other shaving
supplies straight to your door once a
month so you don't have to get off your
butt go to the grocery store find
someone to unlock that freakin safe that
they keep the razor blades in for some
reason I've had people tell me well
Linus they don't keep the razors in a
behind a lock-and-key at my store well
you know what they do here I actually
have footage of it but maybe we can find
or maybe we can but the point is
pain in the butt to go get these
supplies and on top of that you're
paying way too much for them Dollar
Shave club's razors are high quality and
they've got a bunch of other great
shaving supplies too including their dr.
Carver's shave butter as well as their
aftershave and their one wipe Charlies
which actually aren't shaving supplies

video if you liked it dislike it if you
thought it sucked leave a comment below
and let me know about dim drives or just
feelings you're just more complicated
than this as always also linked in the
video description you can support us you
can buy cool t-shirt like this one give
us a monthly contribution so we can make
videos like this one or just there's one
