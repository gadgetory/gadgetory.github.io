guys we're here at the Corsair booth
with some really good news some really
horrible news and then some other really
good news so to start with the good news
we have the K 65 k 70 k 95 so a 10
keyless a full keyboard than a full
keyboard with macro keys all in RGB that
it can be releasing at the end of
September that's good news on too bad
news it's at a Best Buy exclusive for an
undisclosed amount of time so you're
going to have to get it from best buy
for a little while which makes my little
nerd hurt cry I don't know nerd hurt
makes my little nerd heart cry I don't
know why that just happened but it's
still pretty cool that they're actually
having a release date now and it's
actually going to be able to be
purchased because for quite a while now
it's just been like corsair has these
keyboards they exist we've been covering
them for like a year a year and a half
but you can't buy them and you will be
able buy them for a long time so we
actually have a release date now which
is great it's just kind of unfortunate
they have to get them at Best Buy and
the last little bit of good news is that
they have ddr4 memory which you probably
knew already if you watch the LAN show
but what we can see here is there
vengeance LP X which we already saw on
the LAN show which is running between
2666 megahertz and 3000 megahertz but
what we also have here is a nice really
cool cutaway of their dominators which
are also running 2666 to 3,000 but
they're 3,000 says 3,000 and beyond so
hopefully you'll be able to overclock
this one a little bit more thank you
