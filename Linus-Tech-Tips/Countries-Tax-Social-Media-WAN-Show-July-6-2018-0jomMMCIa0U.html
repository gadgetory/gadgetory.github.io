to be happy in a world where the whole
every country everywhere is kind of go
after your internet that's basically
what the news is this week we've got
European Wikipedia sites go dark to
protest copyright reform we've got that
the EU internet copyright bill was
rejected hooray I think I don't know
what ton about it completely we got kids
trapped in caves Thailand and Elon must
try to save them all so ganda has a new
social Uganda has a new social media tax
which is like actually incredibly
expensive compared to how much people
make in general over there this is not
the way roll the intro good it's good
ouchy ouchy ouchy someone sent me a
message on the forum and they thought
that lasted wearing a tunnel better
shirt here and actually really looks
like it no I asked that and he showed me
it's like it's a box no white the white
bar and Heath is like says unboxing yeah
yeah yeah if you need to get around
certain social taxes in Uganda and yeah
LTX you don't need a VPN there because
you'll be doing interactive stuff in in
like real life and things because it's
fun good public Internet access
yeah so let's let's start at the top
Wikipedia did a little bit of a protest
in the EU to protest copyright reform
and how they did that was they basically
turned off to different sites within
Wikipedia so when you go to Wikipedia
you pick your language and each one of
those is essentially kind of its own
thing so I believe they turned off
France and Spain Italy banished an
Italian the Spanish and Italian editions
while in Europe were were off
essentially so if you went to the site
you just saw this giant block of text
that was like by the way that was posted
by mains on the forum thank you very
much I appreciate it
my main user yeah you just saw a bunch
of text that was like hey you're not
seeing information you're seeing a
description of what they're trying to do
in the ways that it will affect look at
this night yeah you said we got going on
right now there we go slow I don't think
those n gadgets fault I think that's us
but yeah yeah so that that sucks for
anyone who had to research anything at
that point
oh man I guess you could probably just
go to a different version of Wikipedia
and like translate the page or whatever
but yeah so this happened ahead of the
European Parliament's final vote on the
controversial EU copyright directive
which is the first time the region is
updating its copyright laws since 2001
the boss tentatively trying to modernize
them but it kind of looks like it's it's
a
war between content creators like like
movie studios and the record business
business business the giant
decentralized Internet of people who
just want to remix and create an upload
like memes that's been at the center of
this for a little while that's how a lot
of people have actually heard about this
is the mean problem but it's it has to
do with a lot of other things as well
and the link tax yeah so there's two
articles within the the big thing which
we have linked in the wine dock here so
if you are watching this later on you
can check the wine dock in the link
below the YouTube video or SoundCloud
yes there is an audio or only only
version of this actually and you'll be
able to find it there the first article
is article 11 which will require is also
posted websites to pay a fee to link to
news publications or to use snippets
from their articles so if you're on
Facebook and you see an embedded snippet
or an embedded link to another article
where you've got a little thumbnail
image part of the title and maybe a
description of the content Facebook
wouldn't be able to show that unless
they paid some kind of license fee to
the owner of that content I think yeah
it's pretty like it's ridiculous as if
as if difficult as if Facebook is just
gonna spend all day every day licensing
all the different pieces of content that
get uploaded to Internet that day it
doesn't make any sense look at this one
quick thing I just wanted to show how
wonderful this is
we're able to stream but I can't even
like load web page priorities baby yeah
we got this though yeah this is dream is
working but I can't see the chat so you
know I'm actually not a hundred percent
convinced that it's working but it might
be I'm gonna go shake pre-recorded yeah
I'm gonna go with yes well this
unintentional load currently there's an
exception in there people were concerned
about link tax where if you've got some
text and part of that text is
highlighted because it's a hyperlink
like check out our last review on this
here that you wouldn't be able to have
that here hyperlink without paying the
tax but I think there's a
for that okay yeah because I would just
break me that's what the Internet's
based on that's what Google is based on
yeah and and there is another exemption
that allows search engines to to use you
input stick around yeah you want to be
found cuz that's good for your bottom
line yeah but you don't want to be
linked to and then you don't want to
lift up other platforms that are
aggregators basically because they're
just profiting off your content you know
paying you enough or like be used as an
image sharing host when that's not we're
supposed to be make cetera et cetera
yeah a big part of it is like the amount
of money that a lot of music artists are
not making from YouTube that they are
making from Spotify so okay we're good
opponents want these these musicians
just to renegotiate with YouTube and not
kind of stained the whole internet with
a shotgun blast yeah okay so my my
webpage finally loaded so twitch tap
people there's the link there you go
sorry about the delay yeah so there's
another article that's article 11 now
then there's also article 13 which
requires websites to filter user
submissions and check them against
copyrighted work that is so brutal and
would just like crush the forum and
everyone's yeah yes yes any online
platform that allowed users to post text
images sounds or code reddit would need
to assess and filter that content which
has a bunch of brutal implications which
are nicely summarized by this like party
this pirate party every serial UGC site
user-generated content site would just
be this is exactly why this is exactly
why Wikipedia was protesting ah because
they are yeah okay exactly they're even
pretty good about like exactly making
sure that everything's all okay but like
policing everything would be so here's a
listing can I send this to you so I can
you click on this one which will source
for so I don't know you might call this
bias because this is definitely one side
of the argument here this is Julia Retta
who represents the pirate party the
pirate pact you can still find good
information
from knowing is always better go down
you can find good information from zero
down consequences list freedom of
expression limited obviously yeah number
one independent creators harmed yeah and
then there's all this like stifling of
innovation and stuff because if okay
let's say you want to have a platform
that gets user generated content if you
need to police that then that either
takes a ton of staff or it takes an
algorithm both those things cost
resources so something like this just
solidifies incumbents and then Boggs
Boggs small businesses down in
regulation that they just can't handle
yeah it's it's really interesting when
putting a law into place is is getting
people to legitimately go to a pirate
party website and be like yeah that
makes sense
like like button but they don't
necessarily agree with piracy that's
that's an interesting
check out this point surveillance risk
due to high development costs for
monitoring technology this will likely
end up like the technology would be
outsourced to some major players who
make that kind of thing so that there
would be a few large players who are the
gatekeepers so everything that's being
uploaded so they have this data of what
a large segment of the population is
uploading yeah that seems to go OK it
doesn't go against GD P R RG d RP I
always forget which way that goes but it
isn't going like it
I think it's a crappy I also had the
same thing yeah I always remember the GD
but after that my guess it doesn't go
against it but I think it goes against
the point almost because they I think I
think the point is to try to reduce the
amount that your your monitored online
if you don't want to be on a certain
website anymore you can ask them to
remove all your stuff if you your those
sites aren't allowed to keep your stuff
for way too long and now it's just like
filter everything monitor everything
make sure everything is ok which again
it doesn't technically go against it
this would
be allowed as long as it was disclosed
and everything was okay and you could
delete it if you wanted couple bla but
yeah it's just weird so we didn't go
through for now yeah the the Wikipedia
protesting was a few days ago I think it
was on Thursday that they had their
first vote but it's not over there
they're gonna they're basically going
back to the drawing board we're gonna
rework the proposal and then all of the
members of European Parliament to get to
vote again and September 10 to 13 this
is a nice long weekend yeah it's a cabin
together although your bong and vote on
their disaster for posting that on the
forum yeah that guys would yeah yeah a
lot of people in the chatter saying that
we look super saturated we are super sad
or not though what I've been told by the
people who set it up it's not actually
oversaturated it's what the colored
light on the back wall looks like oh I
mean that's pretty that actually does
look pretty realistic too this is a blue
light shining on this blue wall that's a
reddish pinkish light shining on that
red wall and then there's pink LEDs
behind that red wall so the walls just
look crazy cuz they're they're blue and
red and then has blue and red being
shines Luke is just full of vitality is
rosy cheeks are actually just full of
rose or yeah rose blood how do you
remember being outside
yeah but you drink your milk yes yeah
yeah yeah I'm getting through various
nodding and thumbs up from it we think
it's because the independent colors of
lights on okay well I can't tell because
we have a gaming monitor that is not
helical abraded at all so what it looks
like okay cool we're going with it yeah
it's fine Best Buy is gonna have this on
their monitors on their showroom floor
on all the TVs look at this it pops baby
oh that sells TVs speaking of look at
this the best segue ever Elon Musk
apparently for whatever reason saves the
world and your children
a cave that got flooded so if you guys
haven't heard of it there's like I
believe it's a soccer team and their
coach yeah was just kind of exploring
around for what I don't know how this
ended up happening but they were in
Thailand
yeah it's a soccer team of 12 Thai boys
yeah and their coach yeah I don't know
why they were doing this but they were
exploring a cave that's cool outside
extracurricular activities kind of
situation I hung out too long they hung
or too long in the cave it flooded and
they kept on getting pushed back further
into the cave because as it flooded more
and more and more they tried to keep
getting higher ground and getting to
more air and all that kind of stuff so
they got stuck god that's way oh yeah
all right they like 2.5 kilometres in
there now really yeah I don't know
yes well someone else I was talking to
you told me Jake said they were like six
miles in there but the thing I read said
two and a half K which is a big
discrepancy but regardless that's scary
as man like yeah just having to retreat
deeper into this thing so it sounds like
at the very least the flooded sections
is 2.5 k because it says it it takes
even the most experienced divers up to
five hours that's right to swim through
the 2.5 kilometres of jagged narrow
channels from where the how what I guess
you're not that many atmospheres down
because you're like just barely under
the water okay it's gnarly apparently so
they were reported missing on the 23rd
of June they were discovered 9 days
later by a pair days later by a pair of
British divers yeah could do nothing
yeah you just showed up and like no you
can't come with us because it's too
crazy of a dive like they have explored
a possibility of getting the boys to
swim out but none of the boys can even
swim they don't know how to swim let
alone dive well even if they were to
dive there trying to get them a special
like full face diving mask because
normal respirators would probably just
get ripped off because it's like super
tight so to explain the super tightness
to these guys have to be well their
master divers for sure but they they
like would at a base level have to have
the tech certificate because there's
certain points where you can't have your
air tank strapped to your back okay so
like I couldn't find
if they had to like run them sat by
their side or if they had to just like
go off air for a second
throw the tank through swim through and
then hook back up I don't know what the
situation is but this is not at all a
simple dock its advanced enough that
tragically a either an ex-navy seal or
current Navy SEAL from Thailand actually
did die diving I think on his way back
yeah so and there's a ticking clock it's
not like they can just hang out and keep
bringing them food there's a ticking
clock because they're in the middle of
the rainy season which goes for like
another three or four months until the
end of October I think and there's rain
forecasted for the weekend up until now
there hasn't been much rain so the water
is gonna keep coming and they're running
out of places to go in fact they might
have beat they might be out of places to
go yeah wait wait there's more they're
running out of oxygen the oxygen in the
chamber that they're in is down to
dangerous levels like 15% or something
like that so they had 10 rescuers with
the boys who delivered food and stuff
and heard their doctors and nurses and
boys the boys and they got five of those
rescuers just to leave because they're
just sucking up too much talk too much
oxygen and they're like bringing oxygen
tanks in to the chamber just so they can
breathe that's pretty wild by the way
guys I can't share screen right now
because I have I have no internet I'm
gonna try to go on what I can't believe
this is happening look Oh God
okay we're still alive apparently I can
see it on my phone I connected the LTE
on my phone whoops you look so natural
that's not saturated at all yeah
whatever so so if they can't walk out so
they can't swim out so then be thinking
maybe they could walk out so they've
been pumping water out of there yeah but
like freaking tons of it right like
millions of gallons yeah and they've
also been trying to dig down to them
they've dug over a hundred holes some of
them are 400 meters deep and this is
where Elon Musk comes in for - brought
you two of those things one he thinks he
can pump water
faster using some like Tesla
battery-operated thing yeah and - he's
sending boring company engineers who
thinks they can dig better or at least
help out in some way so like on Twitter
he's like this is nuts
yes someone messaged him like oh can you
help with this Elan help and he's like
I'll help in any way I can and everyone
just thinks that's like oh well there's
there's no way he can help he's saying
he'll help in any way he can maybe he'll
donate a bit and move on and every like
I have access to the most talented
digging engineers there are I'm just
gonna you know ship a team over well
we'll try to pump water out faster and
then this was my favorite one he also
discussed the possibility of inserting a
nylon tube into the cave to fill it with
air like a bouncy cap that's a long tube
so that is very long tube it's 2.5
kilometres presumably and then make it
just hang out boys
yeah hang out what you know that this
still doesn't solve the water problem if
they're at the end of it if they're at
there like the deepest chamber they can
get to yeah maybe we can help out can we
get some hardware in there have a leg if
they can have a lamb and make a video
yeah yeah you can dive in there yeah
hosted by Lou I would die that made me
feel bad I'm screwed
oh my god I'm also a fairly large person
so these confined spaces sounds like you
kids are in there for nine days like
before they even had contact
having no idea if they're gonna yak it
out that's insane just drinking the
brain water and not eating they're like
all super weak when they get you found
holy cow so prayers and thoughts and all
that to those kids at least I didn't I'm
each other I'm pretty no that sounds
insane but that's like happened yeah
wasn't there like a rugby team that got
lost in the mountains or something yeah
yeah as a movie I think it's called
alive or there's like a plane crash
something like that yeah
they referenced it in The Simpsons I saw
it one's a kid that's all I know but
that's like that was a thing anyways
yeah more rain is expected there's a
bunch of a rescue team
all over trying to help and this has
been quite documented so if you want to
learn more about it you can check it out
but yeah apparently Elon is getting
involved because that's the world right
now that's how that works something
crazy happens so you wanna show I think
I think they're gonna make it I'm pretty
helped pretty old pretty optimistic you
I'm really sad that that Navy SEAL died
you can actually see footage from inside
the cave with the original divers who
found them took a video when they're
speaking to them and I think they even
like we're like facetiming their
families and stuff check it out maybe
they're above the ground there are
places where water runs uphill right
into the next topic all right yeah ganda
social media is now a taxable activity
let me take you on a Internet
spiral journey that I went on this
afternoon when I was reading about this
so first I went to like well this was
posted by duck Dodgers which is where I
started on the forum yes duck Dodgers
and I get to learn about this social
media is now taxable what so so it turns
out that what the government has done
there has told the ISPs that they must
block users from going to certain sites
namely Twitter Facebook whatsapp tinder
a dozens of others crucially tinder yeah
and a ton of others they're blocked
unless they pay this it's not really a
subscription fee it's a per day fee yeah
about five cents us which is 200
shillings I didn't know there are
multiple African nations whose currency
is called a shilling that's pirates the
Caribbean stuff kind of cool maybe they
have doubloons somewhere so it's five US
cents a day I don't mean to belittle
being sensitive I just I never get to
hear the word shilling anyway I've
already I'm digging the hole I'm gonna
reach those deep I'm diggin look this is
getting worse so it sounds like an
insignificant amount of money to us but
keep in mind that there are how many is
it
millions of Ugandan s-- who survive on
less than a dollar per day so for this
to be five cents or like the the per
capita income is $600 so a year this
would be $1,900 have you paid the five
cents for every year there's also an
incentive to sign up for a month in
advance rather than paying per day okay
okay
so so that sucks and you think okay
that's just the government trying to
make some money in the chat which I have
to read off my phone because what the
heck is going on it says that Portugal
is doing a similar thing right now I
hope not but back on track there's it
seems like it's like a like a
money-grubbing like the government's
just gonna yeah it's just a new tax and
maybe they'll use it for a better
internet infrastructure or whatever but
then I thought wait a second
countries like this usually have a high
amount of disparity right so when you
see like the average per capita income
it's probably the case that that average
actually doesn't represent that many
people there's probably a lot of people
in the high-end that boosts the average
and a lot of people on the low end so I
thought those poorest people who live on
a less than a dollar a day they're
actually probably not affected by this
they're probably not the Internet users
or they certainly won't be after they
are affected by this because they won't
be Internet users after this so then I
thought is this like a system of control
is this like a way for people to not be
able to go on Twitter not communicate
not organize themselves not have
protests because they can't go on what's
up they can't communicate with each
other right for it so then I thought oh
this is kind of chin hatty let's Google
Uganda dictator tyrant censorship
buzzwords and so I went of course I went
to like their Wikipedia and there is a
huge laundry list of things they've done
in the past including arresting
opposition members hiring gangs of young
unemployed men to harass and oppressed
opposition supporters and politicians
and critically in February of 2016 the
government ordered the mobile service
providers to block social media
platforms the government claims that
platforms such as Twitter Facebook and
whatsapp spread rumors and create
unnecessary chaos the opposition has
argued
that the ruling was put in place to
prevent the public from reporting
irregularities in the election process
and and to note the the opposition thing
Uganda's president is serving his 7th
term right now yeah so apparently like
the the elections that they have are
kind of fishy yeah so okay then I
learned anytime you hire a gang of
people to harass well possibly they were
they were hired to keep the peace oh
yeah okay ostensibly so then I found out
that actually Uganda put this in place
after neighboring Cannes Ania put in
similar things which is the next topic
here yes they did a little bit
differently what did they do
oh yeah socially dubbed the electronic
and postal communications regulations
2018 not act or anything there was even
a parenthetical thing that I took out of
there
what's a huge name but this basically
requires online content creators which
includes traditional media websites
online TV radio channels but also
individual bloggers and bloggers and
like regular people podcasters to pay
roughly 2 million Tanzanian shillings
which is 930 US dollars in registration
and licensing fees so if you want to
create content you have to like get
essentially like a lot of money business
license but yeah that's a ton of money
man I wouldn't do that even for for like
a a more wealthy nation where like your
average person has more wealth per
capita that's still a lot of if you were
like an American with a thousand
subscribers which is hard to get you
might be like screw this oh yeah yeah so
creators must not only pay these things
creators must store their contributors
details so let's say you started like a
little news network whoever contributes
your site you have to store that authors
details for 12 months and have the means
to identify their sources and disclose
financial sponsors which is like super
Orwellian like transparency sweet but
it's also kind of like who are the
detractors who are supporting them
cafes must install surveillance no
sponsors I don't really mind that too
much but well what's what's involved in
this I was just saying if there's
details no that part I'd like their
address and stuff that part I absolutely
like that but the like disclosing
financial sponsors I guess it would come
down to what details they want about the
financial sponsors and how they have to
disclose it I guess well being like hey
were paid by whoever to do whatever I
don't want to see a problem with that
all right but the rest of it yeah
computers details for 12 months of
course that that's not great cyber cafes
must install surveillance cameras yeah
and then there's all this vague language
like failure to comply with the
regulations which also forbid online
content that is indecent or annoying or
that leads to public disorder which is
just can be anything if you don't like
me yeah failure to comply with that is
going to result in a five million
shilling or twenty two hundred dollar
fine a jail term a jail term of not less
than a year or both so you're screwed so
there's already content creators
youtubers and stuff in Tanzania who have
given up yeah so Tanzania's GDP per
capita like I'm saying earlier eight
hundred seventy nine US dollars so you
wouldn't be able to afford like the
average person there in may not be able
to a year a year's license alone let
alone if you ever screwed up that's over
two years worth of income yeah with no
other expenses at all one of their
famous youtubers called the idea that
this is like a tax the idea of using
this is just like another form of
Taxation a flimsy explains excuse is he
just screwed then
promoted by the government to restrict
free speech and wait it gets even
interesting earlier you're a one blog or
not necessarily a Tanzanian blogger I
know I think and I think it actually was
yeah I think I wrote one blogger but in
the story it actually is this particular
woman well I'm worried about that person
so it gets even crazier because they
have there
like WikiLeaks they're the Swahili
Swahili Swahili WikiLeaks site called
jammy forums how do you say a word that
ends in two eyes jammy I don't know but
they have this history of of course
people upload to their whistleblowing
site and you don't disclose who uploaded
it it's just like people who know like
they're protected right well now this
site has to disclose the details of the
content creators who contribute
definitely one of the reasons why they
did that yeah sure yeah so now it's
either well tell us who posted it or get
shut down that's scary man and another
thing that while you can tell that it's
the calling it attacks it's just
ridiculous is that the blogosphere there
is pretty small oh yeah so they wouldn't
be getting a significant amount of money
from it no it's just a just a means of
control yeah scary stuff totally it's
kind of similar to the European
copyright directive but just completely
different motivations but the end result
is well that's like I'm learnin way I'm
not gonna delve on this for too long
because it's not technology and stuff
but have you looked into the things that
were in addition in the so Canada
recently passed a law is it 100 Senate I
don't think it's will harm sit in for a
little while but essentially marijuana
is like legal and stuff and you can grow
your own and bubble of a button
most of the population up here seem to
be fairly happy about that but also in
that bill there was a bunch of other
things like you're being you're now
allowed to be pulled over without any
form of cause or suspicion and like all
this other oh I didn't know that yeah
you should looking to it's pretty nuts
people are pretty upset about that and
they just got passed through because
everyone was just like oh yes a bill to
make the weeds now legal yes I will sign
and there's a bunch of you must clean
James's booms a kid like you write a
note not that you get someone to sign on
the back it's like you must be my slave
yeah I
you just sold me or so
not at anyways we should we should we
should take a little intermission from
the everyone's trying to be evil and
show you our sponsors sponsors but fresh
bugs so you know if you're trying to run
a business
in a country where you can do that use
fresh books it is a super simple to use
invoicing tool that makes it so you can
send invoices in like less than 30
seconds you can generate them super
quick you can check to see if the person
that received your invoice is actually
read it you can track your time with
their timesheet function you can manage
your expenses to keep track of who owes
you what which is absolutely super
helpful when you're when you're starting
a new business especially a very small
business may be where you are the only
person in the business whatever your
country calls that I think it's sole
proprietorship here yeah if you're
running something like that these little
bits of paperwork just creating an
invoice checking to see if that person
received the invoice checking to see who
owes you what following up on all these
different little things can take a huge
amount of time so the fact that you can
just generate one in 30 seconds the fact
that FreshBooks can manage all your
expenses and expense things for you can
just take a picture of the receipt it
handles the rest all that kind of stuff
is actually super freaking helpful it
also has a feature that tells you oh I
just read the same note again it tells
you when clients look at their invoice
for the first time so that you know that
they've seen it at all if you have any
questions and you feel that you need to
reach out and ask their staff so you can
just do that and you'll speak directly
to a real human there's no phone tree no
escalations now return calls or anything
you just talk directly to a person yeah
great god yes it's nice yeah visit fresh
book stockholm /when and enter when and
how did you hear about a section to sign
up for a free trial and private Internet
access yeah yeah so I I believe actually
VPNs are currently attempting to be used
in Uganda to get past the taxation of
social services thing but now Gondo is
trying to ban VPNs yeah but hey if
you're if you
viewer from there you can use this for a
little while yeah and then maybe until
the ISPs little quote from their
president to being like it's actually
more expensive of a VPN that is just to
pay yeah except you're sketchy dude but
whatever private Internet access
supports a variety of VPN protocols and
types of encryption and authentication
allowing you to dial in the exact level
of privacy protection you need
it supports apps for Windows Mac OS and
Android iOS and here it has Linus but I
assume that means Linux and Google
Chrome with support for several all the
machines autocorrect to that yeah
everything in the building I'm sure they
do our personal phones have to you too
it's a rule when you get hired you have
to go into your like library a can of
tyranny check it out today in the link
in the description or just like here
yeah I almost tickle you oh it's too hot
in here for that it is additional
features of PIAA include IP cloaking
which sounds super sweet browsing
anonymously which is sort of the point
you can avoid data mining targeted
advertising being blocked from social
sites you can block unwanted connections
which is cool the advanced firewall you
can unblock websites which is what I
think a lot a lot of kids in school and
stuff use it for because even I know
some campuses if you live in the dorms
and have internet to your dorm there are
certain websites that are even blocked
there and it's just like dude and you
can save money and then I think we have
Colton here for a special announcement I
see his feet

no replacement for being there smelling
us Wow pheromones you can't actually
detect but that influence your behavior
yeah you'll be forever changed by what
you inhale at this event well you choose
what do you want to talk about next 20
minutes I don't know I think is there
anything happy is there anything that's
like government does something that
isn't crushing their citizens well this
is kind of neutral I think and I think
we have to talk about cuz it's pretty
big many of you may know that earlier
this week Facebook's hate speech
algorithms yeah erroneously or maybe not
erroneously they took down a post that
contained a excerpt from the American
Declaration of Independence so yeah
leading up to the 4th of July I forget
who it was there's a Facebook page in
Texas that was posting snippets from the
Declaration so they broke it up into
twelve different parts and every day
there they're uploading a part I think
it was like old days of Independence
basically and then on day nine or
something like that they got a message
saying that your content has been taken
down so the message didn't specifically
say which content okay so it could have
been any excerpt but they believe that
it's this excerpt that contains their
individual posts wouldn't they know cuz
one of them just wouldn't be there it
sounds like the easiest thing to figure
out never true you are a critical
thinker they did eventually a like
apologized and put it back so but the
post that got flagged was this little
part that refers
Native Americans as merciless Indian
savages so you could you can check out
the full quote by googling it or like
looking on our dock my question to you
Luke is should Facebook put it back Wow
okay that's okay one all right
technically I am American some people
know this I have passwords for both
countries
I was born in Canada I've spent every
single residential Day in Canada I've
never had a residence in America but I
technically have both citizens and
technically I'm like sort of more
American than I am Canadian because I'm
technically a second-class Canadian
citizen I mean the government can deport
me at any time for any reason without a
trial yes we watch it buddy great yeah
yeah I have to watch it because I can be
kicked out at any time but I have a full
bag in citizenship not like a second
class one or anything so I technically
like more stable there even though I've
never lived there it's weird um
at but I didn't know that was in there
that's uh it's pretty aggro yes it's
really interesting because I've very I
grew it's not like the like we've got
another story that we'll talk about in a
second we're an algorithm kind of
flagged something and it was obviously
just not programmed well whereas this
you could argue maybe should have
flagged this but then because of the
status of the document that's like well
like this racism is allowed because it's
an important document well certain
historical things right like it's like I
this is weird
we're going down a weird path for the
land show this is not technology but I
don't think history should be changed
personally like I don't think a book
should be edited that was published in
the past because I don't think it's a
because I think knowing mistakes that
happened in the past is a valuable thing
I think knowledge is more important than
other things generally so then like I
don't know the content isn't a bridge
does that mean that it should be allowed
to be broadcast just because it isn't a
bridge like they don't post it and have
part blurred out they don't change
of Independence is still like is that
that's still an important document right
it's not an important government
document yeah
so I don't really think it should no I
think should be left alone so they
should be a lot but there's not the same
as like leaving it alone is that the
same as broadcasting it I don't know all
right so here's I so personally I think
I think they should be allowed I think
it should depend on the in the context
personally if I given the weight so
Facebook is its own private entity it's
not a government thing so they can do
whatever they want they could they could
be they could be like you know what
no one's ever allowed posting that on
this website and then people that
believe in that strongly would does not
use the website it's a private thing but
with their stance on things in general I
think it would depend on so this is
again I just have to give an opinion
based on what I think they would do
because I think they're allowed to do
whatever they want
given their stance on things it would
depend on the context if this person was
like screw these people because it says
this and the Declaration of Independence
mmm then that I think Facebook would
then step in and want it taken down well
if if they're just posting like this is
the 12 days until Independence Day we're
gonna slowly walk people through the
Declaration of Independence because it's
fairly long and no one's gonna read this
whole post in one little digestion thing
but they might like it and share it
every day as we go through and then they
just happen to get to that part I
personally think Facebook would be fine
with that because I don't think the
intent is there I don't think there was
malice cool bill thing to it I'm not
even sure if there was malice in that
you're at it maybe oh so here's an
easier more cut-and-dry one I think that
up yet same week Google and set Adsense
on Suns Google odd Suns decided that a
web page about a decade's old bill about
sexual abuse was adult content so and it
decided that this web page therefore
should not be able to show ads anymore
so the page which has been up for six
years contains strictly legislative
information it's just all legal stuff
about a bill called the child sexual
abuse and pornography Act of 1980
so that's a lot of hot words and the
algorithm was like this is bad
blocked so then the the person who runs
this website which was a gov tracked us
which is like a legislative research and
tracking website that person reached out
to Google and tried to make an appeal to
like get the site back up and right away
got a response saying no denied denied
the request to unplug the page was
denied and therefore they still can't
run at the the site gets like 37 grand a
year from running ads it's a important
site this particular page because the
bill is so old doesn't get visited that
much so it's kind of a drop in the
bucket for them but if it wasn't so it's
just funny because you can tell because
the site's been up for so long that they
just made a tweak to the algorithm yeah
which made this get flagged I think it's
not really a manual thing right now it's
all machine learning but still the
machine learning algorithm was like you
know what I hate it child porn
jaysus yeah I'm not surprised it got
picked up by something to be completely
honest was just funny how they you can
design an automated system make these
little tweaks and it just propagates and
affects so many people and affects their
bottom line it affects their like their
livelihood but it's necessary because
you just can't have humans going through
all these things this is too much
confident yeah yeah we should have less
content on the internet wait a second
these Tanzanians are onto something
we're making content right now man don't
kill her own jobs
speaking of nothing because there's no
segue for this
we're finally some some some news that
you guys are probably like very directly
interested in AMD be for 50 boards are
coming out
speaking of yeah but anyways ambi has
still not formally announced the B 450
chipset but pre-orders and listings for
B 450 boards from three major
motherboard manufacturers have
already appeared in Austria and Germany
some stores lists some of these
motherboards as in stock but also note
that the product will be ordered from
their warehouse or distributor after an
order is placed which is essentially
like they're saying that they they have
that store is confirming that they have
availability it's not in that stores own
warehouse but their distributor has some
and they can get it from them but still
implies that you're gonna be able to get
it in a few days so that makes it seem
like this announcements gonna be it
really yeah the AC prime B 450 M - a
seems to be available immediately and
many of the boards don't appear on the
manufacturers websites yet which is
weird it could be a retail leak which
happens sometimes but it seems fairly
unlike my question is why do these kinds
of things always seem to happen in
Germany in Austria yeah that happened
not that long ago - always Germany it
always like these German sites are I'm
always translating webpages yeah I don't
know I mean it wasn't it like Walmart
Canada that leaked all of Bethesda's III
stuff I don't remember what it like I
can't read the name post-apocalyptic
follow no huh that makes sense but no
rut rage rage rage - is rich the rage
carry - do you remember yeah it was a
movie was the sequel to carry oh no like
the late 90s a 2000 yeah rage - was a no
Mike it's just one person spamming no
Mike but everyone seems to be hearing
what I'm saying
he's right you're Luke and I'm James
there's no mics here yeah none there is
absolutely no not a single like Mike but
yeah
Bethesda's rage - was leaked by Walmart
somewhere I'm not absolutely sure where
oh we're on the wrong banner whatever
it's not like that sponsors gonna be too
mad at us
yeah so I don't know that's that's cool
more more AMD boards I mean Sonos files
for initial public offering they filed
with an offering size of one hundred
million dollars a placeholder amount
used to calculate the
that is likely to change I don't know
would you buy so no stock off the bat I
because of that thing I mentioned
earlier I can't really invest in stock
market because both countries want to
tax me so would you who knows if I could
I would want to do way more research
into them because I don't know enough
about them right now I would not feel
comfortable right now but I would want
to do more research it seems like Apple
and Google are trying to very
aggressively take over that space and
neither of them seems to be buying Sonos
right now so I would be concerned well
that's the interesting part about it is
they are going public almost because of
that because of the competition in the
space they need money and remember
having a public offering is a
fundraising activity essentially so I
don't know I don't think I would yeah
they're they're in a weird spot right
now but what's cool about their stuff
though is later this year on their so
knows beam which just came out which is
a soundbar it has the it has Alexa right
now soon it's gonna have Alexa and
Google assistant on the same device
which I've never seen anything I don't
think there's a device out there that
has that be pretty cool there's two Hale
one assistant for one task and then just
hail that hail a different except there
is quite a few things that the overlap
isn't very good yeah like there's
there's there's in the Venn diagram
there is definitely the outer circles
yeah they're also gonna be supporting a
serie but I I didn't read specifically
that series gonna be on the same device
as these other assistants okay and I
wouldn't be surprised if there was like
the Apple model and then the everyone
else model cuz I don't see Apple wanting
Siri to be on the same devices google
assistant it's just too much room for
people to be like hey you answer this
question
hey you fail at answering the same
question right side by side yeah
speaking of I'm just gonna go hey you
Seagate I don't know Seagate announces a
mainstream SSD drive that's pretty neat
the smallest model is going for $74
which I believe is 250 gigs and the 1
terabyte model is on sale for $2.99
how about them steam leaks
you gotta click the link though you got
you got to see ok you get to see all
right which games have the most players
but it only works for people that have
achievements outside of games that have
developer achievements so yeah so that's
about half I think it's actually over
how 13,000 out of 23,000 yeah yeah well
half the games on there so you can see a
list I think you went to the wrong link
actually did I the order the arse go to
the arse one garnet medium you guys
gonna see the doc for a second oh like
don't look at my doc scrolls girls ah
get it it's leaking steam that's pretty
pretty dang good actually
oh that pleases me
what is it not here either oh my I have
failed you a scheme fortress 2 is in the
lead oh hey gonna work yeah oh no man
it's on your go farther where farther
down there it is oh hey t borders to
counter-strike pub G player estimate
more people playing tf2 what's really
it's all time though ok yeah ok
I don't really care I am kind of
surprised by some of this stuff like
Robocraft I've never even heard of that
apparently I just downloaded this CSV
suite I needed it for sure whereas what
is that hi Wow
paladin's I thought they were super dead
they have a lot of players did they go
free or something
well what if it was just from the time
period that it was popular was paladin's
ever pop I've never heard of it
I've heard of it but I didn't think it
ever did very well maybe it's an it's
big in a different market or something
it's steam like a global thing of people
use steam in India and Brazil and so-so
pretty sure can we let these people go
on their lives now I think we can yeah
thanks for tuning into the show
hopefully we didn't make you hate your
government because this was a this was
an interesting LAN show but oh yeah this
is not the way it's not have a good one
bye you make your best sound effect
take your brush bones yeah
hey your be right all right hey Thank
You LTA thanks Colton hey what a good
boy he's a good boy good boy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
