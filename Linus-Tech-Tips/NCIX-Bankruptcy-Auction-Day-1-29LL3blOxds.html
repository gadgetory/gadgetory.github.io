auction of my former employer NCIX calm
has begun its today I've got my voter
card this is my registration so it's the
previewing day we're gonna go in we're
gonna see what's what and then we're
actually gonna come back tomorrow
the NCIX tek-tips gold play button is in
there that's my bit I want that and I'm
sure I'm gonna find some other stuff to
check this out for any unfilled orders
please contact your credit card company
to charge back we are sorry for any
inconvenience we're done we're done all
right let's go
synergy - lets you seamlessly share a
mouse and keyboard between multiple
computers check it out at the link below
so I've been to auctions run by these
guys before and it was at their facility
and everything was kind of like put into
bins and carts but on location the rules
are a little different like even at the
check-in desk the computers here they're
up for auction
you you just you go ever like is this
toilet plunger up for auction
no no it's not okay so not everything
but a lot of things so in here is where
they used to assemble all the NCIX pc
computers I was actually in here must
have been a month or two ago and I was
chatting with the the owner former owner
I don't know how that works but I was in
here and it was like crazy like
basically screwdrivers down it looked
like everyone went home for the day and
then just never came back so they've
they've kind of staged things a little
bit make it look a little more you know
auctioning it looks like any machines
that were in the process of being built
and or like this one's got a lot of dust
in it look at this and or I don't know
maybe we're in for repair or we're being
used as demo systems have just kind of
been set up all along the counters here
for people to to bid on them some pretty
good stuff in here so the way that these
auctions work is everything is kind of
grouped into Lots so you can't just bid
on this sapphire HD 2600 XT as though
you would want to if you got to buy this
one terabyte two and a half inch hard
drive this test blank no way there is so
much like epic loot here look at this
alien where Compu mm stress balls this
is doing nothing for my stress right now
you could do like a techie
archaeological dig in this place and
that was already true when I left five
years ago please keep this door closed
what are you gonna do about it
alright ok this is fun we found a home
for the thresh ball i found on the floor
stress stress is all gone now and we've
got some other good stuff here too so
this this was my bad like 8 years ago
I cut a pio for this this is the
mountain mods it's UV green acrylic
stylish that that stayed fashionable UV
green acrylic and it's an external
radiator mount with like these handles
on the top so you would basically like
separate them and then you would screw
in your radiator on both sides and you
could just mount the radiator and just
plonk it down on your desk needless to
say that concept didn't really take off
and making matters worse if you were to
buy one of these today I hope you have a
thermo chill PA series radiator because
otherwise it won't fit and those have
been discontinued for over half a decade
so sorry NCIX I done goofed on that one
another thing I bought that never sold
these that mod smart these were the
primo chill guys sometimes they moved ok
some colors though not as successful as
others more danger den stuff oh no an AM
to hold down for the Swift X storm oh ok
here's another good one I guarantee you
I bought this to Apple GD t yep
so I actually cut my teeth as a product
manager on the water cooling category
because no one else wanted to do it look
at that yellow label there baby this is
the DB one from D tech do you guys
remember D Tech I didn't think so Danny
from D Tech good guy good guy man they
made the best Barb's in the game back
when barbed fittings were cool this is a
fun bin if you want some truly legacy
stuff like this looks really good but
this is a gtx 760 and this doesn't even
look good but it's like funnier than it
than it looks it looks like a crappy
graphics card uh-huh
it's a PCI card this is a this X card
physics by ageia physx this is the
future
okay I need to find out how much the
minimum bid is because like I just want
to do a retro unboxing of office XP
professionals still sealed Adobe
Illustrator cs2 clearly not worth
anything but I'm terrible now that is a
dead operating system if I've ever seen
one
hey I've got an iPad - here's a pink
case for it as long as I'm willing to
buy 30 of them and also holy crap
there's like a couple hundred cases for
the Galaxy Note not the note 3 or note 5
or no 8 the original Galaxy Note oops
that wasn't me
this stuff okay so the way these things
work like everything is as is where it
is so a box like this might be a
treasure trip Oh check this out this is
e 270 something no X 99 not Z 270 so
like whatever is in here is in here huh
also not Z 270 that's another X 99 board
it's got like laptops laptops for days
in here and boxes for like phones and
stuff too like is this a blackberry
phone no see empty box but this feels
like there could be a p9 + inside and
there isn't so you go you're gonna go
through this stuff pretty carefully one
thing I know for sure though is that
Craigslist is going to be flush with
hardware deals hardware deals for days
on Craigslist with markup after this
auction I mean it is kind of depressing
to think about it being reduced to this
like to the point where your promotional
pens are in a bin for auction one day
this
now this kind of stuff is sad
like I remember Irene I worked with
Irene she doesn't have a job anymore
yeah she was really nice I guess I
didn't really have anywhere to go with
that ya know I actually have a good
where to go with that that's kind of a
bummer what Irene stuff is in here a
Sears bag and some gloves
holy is this all of the customer records
this isn't for sale right throw away
okay yeah good I shred hopefully ok so
here's all the good stuff here's a bunch
of like current motherboards X 370 pros
like here's a rampage 5 Edition 10 it's
like a 600 700 dollar board here's all
the graphics cards that are worth
anything as well so your ten sixties 10
70s I mean this should give you some
idea how bad the GPU shortage was that a
retailer went out of business and had
literally 20 graphics cards it stuck oh
wow they've still got one of the
water-cooled FX processors oh and a core
i7 extreme from like four or five years
ago
ouch you can buy all the lunch room
chairs lunch room microwaves mini-fridge
this is the aquarium as I called it or
the boardroom I just felt like I felt
like a fish sitting in here
this was the CEOs office so apparently
he set it up with a projector at some
point it wasn't like this last time I
was
here but I've had a couple of actually
I've had a couple of very tense meetings
in this room so someone had told me that
the gold play button was in the CEOs
office but I didn't see it there do you
know if the gold YouTube play button is
here okay so I'm messaging my old boss
because I really want that gold play
button but in the meantime we did get
some clarification on this one there is
an auction lot for it but here get get
wide because there's a lot of stuff I
got to show here to buy it I have to buy
all of these awards all of this crap
this dinosaur this basketball signed by
Dirk Meyer this TV this stand and these
two plants over here really for a silver
button I might be better off just
telling you guys go subscribe to Linus
cat tips try and get another twenty
thousand subs over there get a cat tips
play button it's been a long time since
I've been here so it wasn't the wisest
move ever but yep it was my call to do
half of the room green screen green and
half of it so this is actually the
original chroma key blue and then they
repainted this one for when the other
team moved over here after they got
booted out of their previous studio if
we uh the idea was we'd be able to green
or blue screen in this room but what
happened in practice was we just ended
up with a lot of green cast on
everything that we shot on the blue wall
this will be the last time I ever walked
through here I haven't been here in like
well over two years three years huh well
I guess this is as good a place as any
to end our tour I guess we'll be back
tomorrow with bidding what are we gonna
