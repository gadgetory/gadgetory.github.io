Russians crazy lab this is the best of
5350 OC and this is going to be a pre
overclocked system now we will be using
the stock default intel cpu cooler which
has about three quarters of an inch of
aluminum finish going on to cool them to
know we're not going to do that we're
going to be using the kulit eco liquid
cooling system so this is a
120-millimeter radiator with a copper
heat exchanger as well as a built-in
pump that is what we will be using we
will be installing it in the fractal
design define r3 and this is the system
configuration we will be using we have
this over here for validation purposes
only the system will not come on a
high-speed pc tech station so what do we
have in terms of spec well this is the
5350 so somewhere in between the 5300
and the 5400 it is also the OC so we
will be pre overclocking the cpu
although we have not yet validated the
overclock that we'll be using so that's
going to be to come in a video down the
line this will ship in its default
configuration with eight gigs of ram a
gtx 560ti a 2500 k unlock cpu remember
for overclocking on the 1155 platform
you do have to have a case series unlock
cpu or you're not going to be going very
far and what we also have here is down
on the bottom we have an SSD so that's a
40 gig SSD now I've always been of the
mind that 40 gigs on an SSD is not
nearly enough for a boot partition but
what we're actually using and this is
the gigabyte z68 xud 3hb three right
here is a z68 board so we're taking that
40 gig SSD and we're using it as a cash
using intel SRT technology which is
featured on this board for the western
digital caviar Oh welcome hold on sorry
guys crazy Russian was going like this
to me not thought he meant like you know
one moment please or your number one or
something along those lines but no
that's not what he meant at all but he
actually meant was this is
WD caviar blue one terabyte that we're
using for the boot drive so we're using
smart response technology to accelerate
our boot drive without having to buy a
larger capacity more expensive SSD to
boot off that exclusively since we're
down here actually we also have a
seasonic m12 to 6 20 watt power supply
that is with 80 plus bronze efficiency
and let's move up to the motherboard
itself so this is a z68 xud 3 h b3 and
if that's a tongue twister then well you
need to work on you know not being
puzzled by easy tongue twisters I guess
but but what it is is it's a z68 board
so that's what gives us support for
Intel Smart Response technology well we
also have support for and you're going
to have to come around and look at the
back of the board for this is onboard
video with hdmi displayport VGA and DVI
as well as right there you see that
little sticker that says lucid virtu so
we can use intel quickpath technology I
think that's what it's called right
quick path I don't know what I don't
know what is called but it's the one
that makes your video transcoding go
really really fast maybe it says on here
virtue virtualization for the onboard
GPU yes ok yeah see they don't they
don't say you do either way it doesn't
really matter what you get is better
efficiency at idle because you're able
to use the onboard GPU whenever you're
idling or doing anything to D you can
use the onboard GPU yeah so there's the
idle power consumption of the system 56
wat I know right it's like almost
nothing considering this as a full-blown
gaming machine you can use the onboard
GPU for video transcoding which it just
kicks by that it's way faster than using
the cpu it's way faster than even using
a high-end dedicated GPU and then when
you're gaming you can actually use the
power of your dedicated GPU you can
still output actually I think the
optimized mode is to help put through
the dedicated GPU and then virtualize
this one either way you can use this for
gaming this for what is good at and you
win you get better power consumption
great gaming performance and great video
transcoding performance now with the
68 chipset not yeah that's pretty that's
those are the main features you get we
also have support on this particular
board which is an awesome value that's
why we went with this one for nvidia sli
technology as well as AMD crossfire X so
we can run up to two cards in sli or
crossfire you can configure your system
either way you want and that will be
running in 8 X 8 X mode which as we've
tested in the past on my show does not
give you any sort of a performance
disadvantage versus running in 16 x + 16
X mode the board also has dual BIOS
which is nice that's a great
overclocking friendly feature because it
means that even if you screw something
up when you're overclocking it on your
own remember your NCIX PC warranty is
not invalidated by overclocking so I
mean this is going to come pre
overclocked you can see if you can push
a little bit further if you want that's
also good you can recover to the main
BIOS if you screw something up which is
great you've also got a solid power
delivery system especially for our board
in this kind of a price bracket that's a
6 + 1 phase power design with lower RDS
MOSFETs and ferrite core chokes also
solid capacitors and I think that pretty
much covers everything to say about this
little guy oh absolutely one more thing
check this up so the front USB right
here so your two front USB ports will be
hooked up to the one with the red
background and what that means is that
it can deliver up to forty percent more
amperage on your front USB that means
you can actually charge your iPad or
even a tablet if you have the utility
installed on your PC and you can charge
it right off a USB port without using a
power adapter from the wall so thank you
for checking out my little introductory
video of the best of 5350 OC and
hopefully you guys will stick around and
check out the video once we've got the
overclock validated once we've got it
all built up and once we have this thing
priced up because I don't even have a
price yet we're just making sure that
it's going to be awesome first</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
