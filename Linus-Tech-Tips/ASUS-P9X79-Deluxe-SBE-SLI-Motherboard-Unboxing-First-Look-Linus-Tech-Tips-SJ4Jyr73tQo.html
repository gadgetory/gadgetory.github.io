x79 deluxe so out of their non
sabertooth and non Republic of gamers
boards this is the highest end it's
pretty much a fully loaded x79 board
with all of the standard x79 features as
well as some more unique Asus ones so
the first thing we see over here it is
pcie 3.0 ready so there you go that's
there in the corner we got that out of
the way right off the back it uses the
x79 chipset supports intel core i7
extreme edition or non extreme edition
processors on LGA 2011 we've got support
for nvidia sli as well as AMD crossfire
x quad channel ddr3 memory with up to 8
dims supported we've got bluetooth 3.0
which is basically what they're included
app it allows you to do a few cool
things with it and it's also better
bandwidth than any previous versions
we've got there UEFI bios which their
implementation was very very good on
their previous generation board so I'm
expecting it to be excellent here
Asus SSD caching uses a third-party
controller so even though Intel doesn't
have SRT support on this chipset ASUS is
how it found a way to use a third-party
chipset to support SSD caching anyway
precise power control using their sixth
generation of digital vrm solutions
including not only digital vrm on the
CPU itself but also on the memory what
else we got here so dual intelligent
processors with new digi plus power
control so that is there TPU as well as
their epu so the TPU is responsible for
any performance tuning it can do
automatic tuning and Asus claims you can
achieve up to pretty close to what you
can do without automatic tuning so by
manually dialing in your overclocking
Zeus figures with the with this module
doing it for you rather than working off
of just a preset profile the TPU tweaks
it adjusts it and can get pretty close
to what you can do on your own so I'm
looking forward to testing that out
we've also got their EP you which is
basically under bolting profiles as well
as some utilities that allow you to make
your PC more power efficient USB BIOS
flash back this is really cool so just
by putting the BIOS on any USB storage
device renaming it to a standard name
and then holding down this button it
takes about 30 seconds to two minutes
and you can reflash your BIOS no matter
how corrupted it is even without a CPU
or memory installed in the system
phenomenal
USB 3 boost allows them to use you ASP
which isn't supported by many devices
now but this will be important in the
future to get faster transmission speed
over USB it can also use the scuzzy
protocol as well all right not discuss
its protocol sorry the which ones the
other one that it uses hold on I'm just
gonna cheat and look over my notes there
and you ASP oh yeah okay legacy mode
scuzzy and USD okay I was right
excellent
we've also got fan experts which gives
you five five configurable fan headers
including the CPU one and for the case
ones and then an additional one that
runs in clone mode or mimic mode off the
CPU 1 and finally DTS audio so they have
upgraded the codecs that are included
with this particular board and I think
that pretty much does it for the
packaging let's get it opened up and
have a look yes I think everything on
the back is pretty much what we've seen
already supports 3-way SLI and up two
quad crossfire X for those who were
wondering here's the board itself but
I'm just gonna show you guys the
accessories before we get into the board
itself and we'll find those down here ah
all kinds of good stuff included here so
we have Bluetooth V 3.0 HS module okay
it's instructions for how to mount or is
it here this thing Hey
all right we've got an i/o shield which
is helpfully labeled we've also got some
SATA cables so one two three four so
looks like four SATA 3 six gigabit per
second cables and four SATA 2 3 gigabit
per second cables we've also got an
antenna we've got an SLI bridge a 3-way
SLI
remember your crossfire bridge should be
included with your with your video card
not your motherboard we've also got
their cue connector so that's for your
front panel connectors as well as one of
your front USBs we have a driver disk
which I'm probably gonna have to use
this disk because this is a pre-release
sample board and we've also got a user
guide which is probably incomplete at
this time as well but your retail board
will come with a proper driver disk and
you'll be able to go to the Asus website
to download the latest drivers whereas I
can't because the word is not yet
released alright let's open it up and
have a look at the board itself so a
Seuss's layout is what I would consider
to be fairly ideal here so you've got
one two three slots that are going to be
your go-to slots for a 3-way SLI or
3-way crossfire without overhanging the
end of the board which would require you
to have an eight slot chassis you know
what the let's okay let's start at the
socket so here's your LGA 2011 socket if
you guys aren't familiar with this
already which you're probably not too
familiar with you do need to unfasten
both arms and lift up the flat in order
to open up the socket install your 2011
processor and then you have to put down
this arm and then this one in order to
get it closed again before anyone asks
and I always get these questions no you
cannot put a 1366 or an 1155 core i7 or
Core i5 processor in there it will not
work you will need a 2011 processor this
is a brand new socket and a brand new
architecture so speaking of brand new
architectures we've got support for quad
channel memory so look at that eight
DIMM slots gives you up to 64 gigs of
memory using what's available on the
market today you can buy eight gig
unbuffered dims Wow or 32 gigs of memory
on the cheap because Ram is so
inexpensive these days you can have a 32
gig system which is workstation class at
that point without spending a ton of
money simply awesome okay we've got our
8 pin power connector in its ideal
location up here at the top left
we've got moving over here a couple of
those fan headers that I talked about
before as well as an additional one so
there's
in the top right corner here for more
DIMM slots our 24-pin connector in its
ideal location along the right hand edge
one more fan connector front USB 3 and
what I personally consider to be its
ideal location along the right-hand edge
because one way or another this is going
to plug into either sort of up here or
down here it's going to go to the front
of your case though not the bottom of
your case which is where we typically
find USB front panel headers here we
find for us say 2 3 6 gigabit per second
ports and 4 SATA 2 3 gigabit per second
ports as well as our front panel headers
our TPU so remember that's the
performance one and our EPU which if
you'll recall is the efficiency one
remember to remember guys these don't
actually like if you if you flip the TPU
that switch that's not actually going to
like affect any overclocking settings
that you're using you just you're just
using that if you want to use like the
the tools that asus has built for pre
overclocks
ok we have 4 USB to front panel headers
just a lot yeah yeah they're all USB
we've got a clear seamless which
built-in reset and power switches a post
LED readout this is truly a very
high-end board so everything on here is
pretty much the cream of the cream we've
got one held on which ones are actually
wired for 16 x12 that are wired for full
16x operation and it looks like that's
why asus has included a long sli bridge
because if you are running dual cards
they want you to run in this one and
this one which would leave you with two
8 X slots for additional expansion
remember you can install 1x or 4x or 8 X
cards in an 8 X slot so that gives you
the best flexibility so 2 dual slot
graphics cards is going to cover up your
next 2 1 X's but leave you with two more
slots so it's not not a bad little
layout there in terms of cooling and vrm
so this is this is interesting so if
Zeus actually has their vrm heatsink
stretches all the way around here so I
just want to give you guys a good sorry
I'm trying to find a good angle for you
that you guys can check out the cooling
solution so there's a heat pipe linking
the two coolers and I'm just
turn it over here so you guys can have a
look now one thing that's really
challenging from a board design
perspective on these eight dam LGA 2011
boards is that compared to previous
generation products there's very little
room to put power delivery systems over
here and on top of those on the top of
the word because this socket is so much
larger than a 1366 socket I mean a 1366
socket is more like this plus you're
adding a full two additional DIMM slots
and making it so that you pretty much
have to put them on both sides of the
CPU socket so that's an engineering
marvel to be perfectly honest with you
guys on the back we're gonna find no ps2
port look at that
1 2 3 4 USB 2.0 ports that handy-dandy
BIOS 3 flash button so there's the
color-coded port for that we have 1 2 3
4 5 6 USB 3.0 ports we have two Gigabit
Ethernet ports optical audio out two
eSATA ports and 7.1 audio out so truly
the kitchen sink is pretty much included
there check this out we've also got
power delivery circuitry built into the
back of the board so here's a heatsink
here's some modules and then here is
your prototype back plate for the LGA
2011 board here so one thing that you
guys might want to bear in mind if some
of the newer cases these days their top
cooling fans are designed for exhaust
but if I see something like this where
I've got heat sinks here that are in a
crowded area that's difficult to cool
and then I've also got additional
components on the back of the board I
might think about in a case that has a
top fan turning that fan around and
blowing it down on to the CPU socket in
order to get additional cooling remember
these CPUs and once you're overclocking
are capable of sucking about 200 watts
through the CPU socket alone that it's a
serious amount of power and a serious
amount of heat to dissipate in a very
small area so based on seeing that if
you have this board and you can get some
benefit from the additional cooling on
the back of the board I say go for it so
