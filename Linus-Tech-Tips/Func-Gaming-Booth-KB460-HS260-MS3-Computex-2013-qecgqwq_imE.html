2013 is powered by Western Digital our
trusted gaming gear partner is corsair
vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCIX calm so you've got three guesses
as to which booth were in at computex
right now in the first two don't count
because this right here is one gigantic
computer mouse this is the funk ms3 and
it is designed for giants who need mice
that are actually made of foam and don't
actually work no really this is just a
prop and what they're actually showing
off is not the ms3 the ms3 is the
product that's in the market now and
they are expanding the gaming product
lineup to include some pretty cool new
stuff over here so right here we've got
the KB 460 you know funks really sort of
really creative about the way that they
use numbers to a you know name their
products kb obviously stands for cone
brilliance where the the cone is spelled
with a k no actually it's keyboard so ms
for mouse you know I keyboard for games
ok so this right here is a mechanical
gaming keyboard it features Cherry MX
red switches it's got a braided cable
it's got a built-in USB hub so you got a
couple of ports there it also has some
software functionality that goes into it
so you've got 5 different profiles which
are accessible over here with the f7 to
f11 keys you've got built-in media keys
that are accessed with a function
command as well as a ok you're going to
notice a pretty non standard layout here
but don't worry about that because the
North American model will have sort of
full-size shift keys full-size enter
keys it does have a red backlight and
you can also see it has a red backplate
that really makes that light more
vibrant and really really glow next
thing is the detachable wrist rest now
if you're anything like me you've
probably broken at least a few of these
at some point in your life now funks
goal was to make the wrist rest as
simple as possible in the way it
attaches meaning that it shouldn't break
so we're going to go ahead and turn this
around the mechanisms actually not here
yet but they assure me it shouldn't
break and if it does break the idea is
they will just ship you a new one no big
deal they'll take care of it
couple days later you will be back to
having your wrist rest permanently
attached to your keyboard next up over
here we have a couple of funk mousepad
so these of the f-series 10 l and 10 XL
they're basically using a similar
surface to what we've got on their
existing products except that they are
flexible they are single sided so they
have a rubberized grip so they don't
move around too much while you're trying
to move them and obviously they are
optimized for use with the ms3 gaming
mouse it glides very nicely over top of
them you get that hockey puck effect
there we go and finally the HS 260 this
is not a finished sample but i'll go
through the general specs of it anyway
it's got 50 millimeter drivers it's got
some of the softest biggest cushions
that i think i've ever seen on a headset
before it has you know your adjustable
sizing it's got I'm gonna have a problem
here cuz I can only hold this microphone
with one hand can I get you to hold this
microphone for me sir thank you very
much okay so here we go I can put this
on my head now don't have to keep
stalling for time very plush ear cups
there we go you've got your size
adjustment just like that so you could
put it on like sort of you know like you
got like a huge head or something like
that now I have two microphones all
right now where does the functionality
come in because that's what funk stands
for functionality perfected I'm just
going to show you the functionality so
number one you can remove the mic
alright that's cool we've seen this
before personally I'm more excited about
the fact that the mic is like this well
I mean I don't want to put it here but
I'm more excited about the fact that the
mic is pretty much infinitely adjustable
because often boom mics end up out here
for me which means you spin until them a
lot and there's a lot of hissing that
comes with with SSS noises and things
like that so if you can put it right
here in the corner of your mouth where
it's actually optimal you're gonna get a
better experience for the person on the
other end the next thing is the
removable cable and removable cables
aren't exactly new but look at this one
there is absolutely nothing exceptional
about that cable that that is a standard
standard headphone jack cable and that's
why I like it because it is completely
standard you do not have to worry about
any kind of proprietary nonsense if your
cat chews through your cable like what
happened to my pc 350s or if you lose
your cable like I've probably done with
something at some point but my memory is
failing me right
now now the other thing is you can
actually switch these around so you can
switch this over here you can switch
this over here if you feel like it the
microphone itself has a mute button
built into the bottom of it and the
headphone left earcup or right earcup or
wherever you want to put it I guess has
a built-in volume control knob as well
now this is not a finished sample like I
said so your finished product may vary
but stay tuned because the hs2 like
looks like it's going to be pretty sweet
