the only true successor to the original
enthusiast glass case from Corsair this
is the 900 d and it picks up where the
800 d left off the 800 d was at the time
revolutionary it made cable management
turn into something that everyone could
do with its grommeted cable management
holes that by now pretty much everybody
has copied it was huge and it wasn't
afraid to be huge before the 800 d the
only cases you could get that were large
we're not even really like a lot of the
time they weren't even proper like
normal cases like they had five and a
quarter inch bays that were like weirdly
mounted on the side and stuff like that
and it was not afraid to let you water
cool the 900 e takes everything about
the 800 d and just completely amps it up
it's like injecting steroids directly
into its carotid so there you go for
foam we've got a fairly not quite super
brittle foam but it's also not a closed
cell soft foam but course our
compensates by making it extremely thick
and as you guys know it is the girth not
the length that is the most important
thing you've got another inch and a
quarter or so right here on the top so
let's go ahead and tilt this over so you
guys could have a look at what the 900 d
looks like inside the case so while the
box is huge the 900 d is also huge I'm
probably going to need slicks help
taking this out of the box so we're
going to tip it over and we'll be back
in just a moment how big is the 900 d
you might ask to which I would reply you
could easily fit at least 6 cats inside
before they even started to like cause
problems so it comes with bubble wrap
around it to prevent any kind of or at
least my review sample dies I don't know
if they all do but this will prevent any
random incidental sort of punctures and
jabs with this cardboard and this bubble
wrap layer here so I'm going to go ahead
and
pull this off you've got another
cardboard layer here which hopefully I
can remove I thought I was done with my
knife but they've packed it extremely
well to ensure that it gets here safely
and this is going to be especially
important packaging wise course there
could not afford to skimp on this case
because especially once you actually
build a system inside it it is going to
be heavy and big so unless it's built
extremely solidly and packed extremely
well you are going to end up with a
damaged computer at the other end of any
kind of shipping expedition so we're
having some trouble here and we're going
to get this wrapping done here got the
box out of the way and the unveiling is
pretty much complete ain't she a thing
of beauty
gorgeous enormous window that shows you
everything if I mean at the angle you'll
actually normally be looking at it from
so we're going to go ahead and adjust
that right there so it shows you
everything from your back radiator
presumably your motherboard you're going
to see the power supply a little bit but
not too much and then you're going to
see a little bit of your drive cages
here but again not too much of that
we're actually going to take a little
bit of time to take all of the plastic
covers off so there's plastic covers
holding things like the the i/o cover in
place holding things like the front
panel in place as well as protecting
things like the side panel window here
and little bits of trim like this so
we'll be back in a moment again with all
that removed so I wanted to show you
guys a few things that I noticed when I
was taking the plastic off
number one is holy crap the system for
side panels on this case is cool so I've
taken the black plastic off the window
you can see it's very very clear very
transparent however you still get that
thing with all acrylic windows where it
does it's very staticky so it tends to
collect see the cat hair on it already
but that's just kind of life the side
panel because it's basically all acrylic
does have a bit of flex to it but I'm
not super concerned because it still got
some weight which is going to help
resist any vibration I love the mounting
system for the glass just look at this
it's like solid screws and just off
feels really good I mean even mighty jo7
which is the case that I'm using right
now just had like cheesy little plastic
fixings on it not very not very great
now you don't have to remove the top
panel in order to remove the bottom
panel here so you just pop this open and
it's on a friction hinge here so right
there and then over on the other side
there's another one just like that that
controls this opening up and I wanted to
show you guys how Corsair has included
all the appropriate little bits of
adhesive so that things don't fall off
in shipping so they've protected all the
corners and then they've protected
things like the magnetic fan filters
from coming off magnetic fan filters
really are the best way to go about this
because every other system I've seen I
mean the original sort of fan filters in
cases were usually screwed on and then
some of the later ones came along and
they were like latched on or they were
slid in or whatever else but check this
out I mean this is how hard it is to
remove your fan filter yeah take that
you throw it under the sink you clean it
out you put it back in just like that
and the fact that the intake for the
case here and the exhaust for the case
over there is so easy to get at is
extremely convenient now speaking of
intake and exhaust you can see all
around the edges here there's a gap here
as well as over here and all along the
bottom that is how that fan is actually
getting any air and Corsair thought
about this
they didn't just sort of willy-nilly you
know apply ventilation holes here
there's a gap between that piece on the
front and these pieces right here where
you apply your fan filter that's going
to allow for there to be it acts as a
bit of a I'll crap the word escapes me
shroud thank you
shroud that will allow it to actually
draw some air in so that's very very
smart now I want to take you around to
the other side really quick so and there
we go that's latched on where I want to
show you it's okay I got it it's not
actually that much heavier than an 800 d
which is nice it does use aluminum
support struts in order to keep from
just being it's just glue to Christie
heavy so there you go if I can move it
you can probably move it the one button
releases at the back for the top panels
here or first I'll show you that
functionality where the bottom opens up
without the top actually being open so
you can get at your drives you can
actually upgrade your hard drive if you
ran yourself cables down from the
motherboard and just kind of kept them
here you could upgrade your hard drive
without actually even opening up the top
panel which is very cool there's another
removable fan filter there so these one
button releases are great you press them
we pull out the side panel and then it
comes off this ones bound to be a little
bit more solid yeah just because it
doesn't have that big acrylic piece on
it the way that it latches in up here is
very robust very strong I can't imagine
that that would break in any sort of
real world situation now cable
management room at the back this is
where the 900 you really shines and
that's I mean this is where the 800 D
really changed the game because it added
enough room for proper cable management
that everyone could do without you know
origami cabling as voodoo pcs to cause
check this out that looks like more than
an inch behind the motherboard tray that
means you could have a 24 pin ATX cable
and something else running back here
without running out of room and without
having to do that thing where you force
the back panel on and you can push on in
order to get it to actually close and
the funny thing is George the designer
for cases for Corsair said to me he
showed me his hands he went I have
really big hands really thick fingers I
designed my cases so I can work in them
I'm like yeah okay it sounds about right
so on the back you find not only all the
cable management grommets you could want
which come out at the top for drives or
at the top for drives depending on
whether you've got an ATX or an e ATX
for hptx width board you've got them
here for your 24 pin as well as your PCI
Express here for more PCI Express as
well as cables for the drives of human
love this so many cases do this and
drives me crazy where they'll have
something interfering here between the
drives and the motherboard it's like
manufactures hello we have to run cables
from the motherboard to the drives did
you not think of this SATA cables
they're not 24 48 inches long a short so
there you go thank you Corsair for
thinking of this because there's lots of
room to coil them up and hide them and
keep them on these on these drive cages
here so very very nice you've also got
plastic clips for holding cables in
place and tons of these little anchors I
love these 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 these are
great because they allow you to without
sort of folding things sort of under
each other and all that they allow you
to take everything route it neatly and
then strap it down so that it's not odd
so it's not ugly and gross so even even
over here check this out 1 2 3 4 just
for bringing your 8 pin or your 4 pin up
to the motherboard itself speaking of
your 8 pin or 4 pin check this out
this right here is an extension cable
and also an adapter so if you have a
motherboard that goes that just has a
single 8 pin you can just run this as an
extension and then you can tuck this one
back here in your ample storage room if
you have a motherboard that takes an 8
out of 4 such as a crosshair 5 formula
you can plug a single 8 pin into this
and plug this into the board itself so
very very handy
nice big CPU cut out so you're going to
have no problem installing CPU coolers
that that do require a backplate without
removing your motherboard and the
motherboard tray itself has a little bit
of flex but you come to expect this from
motherboard trays that have all this
room for cable management as well as the
CPU cutout and the cable management
cutouts up here and once you actually
strap a board to it you're not going to
notice any kind of a problem with that
so I'm not not too worried about that
particular thing nice little rubber
grommets in here so that you're not
going to see look at these see these
noise dampening pads right here Corsair
doesn't want this case to make noise so
they've actually included kind of a
blu-tack mod style thing that'll keep it
from having any sort of vibration let's
finish up at the back here and then
we're going to go or we'll finish up on
the outside and then we're going to
spend some more time on the inside I
apologize guys this is going to be a
long video but this is a very important
case for the evolution
cases in general I want to make sure I'm
covering it adequately it's all about
cooling so one of the criticisms of the
800 D was that it didn't do air cooling
as well as it did water cooling so
Corsair has taken all that feedback and
opened up every available surface all
along the back your extra power supply
plate your i/o shield your 120 or 140
millimeter fan and the back as well as
the entire top of the case oh what a
bottle is all good is all mesh now this
mesh has a fine filter on it in addition
to the to the cutout metal so it's also
got a reinforcement plastic bracket on
it there you go so it's going to be nice
and strong and I think that's pretty
much it for the back and the top we'll
get to more about the inside once we're
on the inside I just want to leave
myself around the case in a logical way
so I don't miss anything
that's really important to me so up at
the top there we go we've got our i/o
microphone headphone 2 USB 3 super speed
reset button love to see this tucked
away swear the cats won't accidentally
hit it 4 USB 2.0 ports this is great to
see because so many motherboards have
anywhere from sort of two to six USB two
headers built into the inside and it's
like what am I going to plug into this
thing you guys none of my cases support
well now we have a case that supports it
so there you go very nice to see power
buttons right here in the middle and
then you've got four or five and a
quarter inch expansion bays now you
might say Oh Linus that's sort of odd
because I thought that's what a five and
a quarter inch expansion day looks like
this is a lot bigger than five and a
quarter inches and I would go yes you're
right because in order to not lose the
integrity of the look of the case well I
think I might need to open those from
the inside I actually don't remember how
these come off from the from the video
we did at CES but in order to not
compromise the look of the case Corsair
decided to widen the five and a quarter
inch standard to make it sort of work
for them so I'm going to figure out how
this comes off because I can't remember
all right so we figured it out I could
actually get inside the case to work on
it which is
because that's what I had to do there's
little tabs in the back okay well you're
going to do is release those with your
fingers just pinch those and then the
whole thing comes out now you can see
this is obviously much larger than a
five and a quarter inch device but what
Corsair has done is they have because so
few people even use five and a quarter
inch devices they want it to look clean
if you don't install anything and then
they've used kind of a stylized oh I
might as well show you the tool list
installation here you guys so you just
peel this up slide the drive in and then
let it click into place drives in you
can screw it in with a couple screws if
you want to too so they've gone with a
recessed bezel here that will match your
five and a quarter inch device just like
that now we pulled off the solid
aluminum front piece simply by prying it
up from the bottom so you can see
there's four four points here that will
hold that in place there you go got your
nice little Corsair logo on there and
the front had a couple more little
pieces of tape that we're holding in
another very conveniently removable fan
filter so Corsair includes not their
regular class of fans with this case but
their their airflow style sort of
modeled after their AF series fans so
the entire front comes through this look
I mean look at what the thought they've
given to this so like oh okay well fans
pull air from directly in front of them
but they also pull air from the side of
directly and from them as well and the
whole thing's filtered you can take this
thing off clean it and you are good to
go so here once I put that in place you
can see it draws air here so you can
actually if you get a bit of a better
angle there you can see from that side
how there's lots of room there and then
you can also get air from the front here
as well now you can replace these fans
you can install a triple 120 millimeter
radiator up here without much difficulty
whatsoever and that is part of what will
lead us to the inside of the case where
we will start to investigate the water
cooling options that are available now
speaking of water cooling options the
side of the bottom panels here you can
actually remove this solid piece slip
pointed this out to me simply by
removing the eight screws here so
that'll leave you with a mesh side on
either side or both sides giving you
even more access to fresh air for the
components that you're keeping inside
there now let's go ahead and flip it
down to the bottom so we can see if
there's anything interesting to see down
there or to let go of it here so much so
on the bottom no not a whole lot that is
interesting down there so there you have
it I think it makes a difference that on
the older 800 D the bottom had that fan
filter for your power supply whereas the
900 D uses a side mounted power supply
so it's going to draw its air from the
outside of the case here or the outside
of the case on the other side rather
than from the bottom of the chassis
we've included some SATA cables and I
guess we'll figure out how those work in
a moment but there you go these are the
mounts that are going to hold your power
supply in place and keep it from putting
any unnecessary strain on the back of
the chassis itself and then this right
here is an additional mounting point for
more three and a half inch or two and a
half inch hard drive or SSD mounting
cages so let's go ahead and close this
up again I you know it's interesting
because I found myself closing and
opening it quite frequently but what's
good is I'm able to do it quickly and
efficiently because that is how you are
going to upgrade your computer you're
going to want to just go flip flip open
open do do whatever you need to do and
then move on you don't want to spend all
day every day you're actually working on
the thing so harddrive mounting options
you've got these little sleds here that
are capable of mounting three and a half
inch drives to lessly or two and a half
inch drives by screwing them in and then
it comes with three sleds that each
holds three drives so they lips hold on
you see if I got that lined up correctly
there so we've got three in each one
that clip in like that you can see they
popped out a little bit and shipping but
shouldn't be anything to worry about now
you can install you can actually locate
their modular for one thing so you can
move all your drives to the basement and
then you can go ahead and install pumps
or radiators or whatever other you know
add action figures I've seen those in
computers before up here that you want
you can take this one and move it up
here and you can keep all your drives on
the front or some water cooling over
here on this side
cooling over here on the other side
maybe just a small single one 20 mil
radiator or you can pull them all out or
you can add a full additional two for 15
two and a half inch or three and a half
inch drives in the case natively so
those will be available from Corsair
these are those aluminum pieces that I
talked about before those supports and I
think that pretty oh yeah mounting right
okay so mounting four radiators is
awesome so you can do up to a okay here
let's let's let's do all the radiators
now you can do a quad 120 millimeter
radiator across here pull up these
drives you can put a power supply here
and you can do a dual 120 millimeter
radiator on the other side then you can
put up to a triple 120 millimeter in the
front up to a triple 140 or quad 120 in
the top you can do a single 120 or
single 140 in the back and I think what
I actually missed was this could be a
triple 140 or a quad 120 as well so the
radiator mounting options you can have
up to five radiators in the case without
making any modifications to it which is
absolutely outstanding motherboard
compatibility as I mentioned before is
pretty much unparalleled so you can
install an ITX board an M ATX board to
go down to about here an ATX board which
will be this big and then check this out
an XL ATX board which can go all the way
down from either eight or nine expansion
slots here I'm going to give you a bit
of a better angle air slick so eight or
nine expansion slots remember they've
included ten expansion slots so even
with a nine expansion slot board you
could install a dual slot card in the
very very bottom slot and then you can
even install an HP TX board which would
take out pretty much the entire thing
here and would allow you to really make
the most of this particular beast
chassis I wonder if we've missed
anything we did show this in the top
here so you can see all those different
mounting hole options depending on what
you opt for up there let me just go sort
of scan through and I'll see if we
missed anything so here's our variety of
boards that we'd like
to try out in the 900 d it does say on
the box it's compatible with ITX so I'm
obligated to put an ITX board in there
let me show you guys what it'll look
like if you build a system with a single
PCI Express slot and about 1/2 of 80 X
or 1/2 of sort of slightly wider than 80
X width on it so that's sort of
ridiculous here's what an m-80 X board
will look like inside so most people are
not going to go micro ATX with a with a
system like this but that's your 4
expansion slots and standard width next
up we're going to do ATX so this is a
crosshair 5 formula this is one of those
ones where that that extension cable
will come in handy all right so this guy
right here is going to look a little
something like this so that's 7
expansion slots and standard width so
you can see there's tons of room over
here for much much wider boards than a
standard ATX board now the next one I
have is a bit of a hybrid because some
boards are labeled as EA TX but what
they actually are is slightly wider than
ATX so you see here how there's a little
bit of extra width to this board that
makes it sort of e-atx but it's also
wider than normal because there are
seven expansion slots but there's a
burned one here at the top so this is
actually 8 X panshin this is the biggest
XL ATX board that I had on hand this is
next 79 ud7 from gigabyte and even that
doesn't look that big in the 900 d I did
miss something on the inside so in here
we've got all of our front panel
connectors our USB to our HD audio or
other more different USB to USB 3 front
panel headers as well as three SATA
cables so what I noticed is that two of
the included triple harddrive cages do
not have back planes but one of them
does so if you slide that out you can
see that that is a toolless installation
so you can pre run presumably there's
power over there somewhere I think I did
see it before you can pre run power to
the backplane pre run SATA data to those
three drives and you can just take down
this thing pop in a drive and you are
literally ready to go without any
difficulty if you have hot
up enabled on your motherboard you
actually won't even have to turn off
your computer which is very very cool so
we're going to put the case back
together and do some size comparisons
against some other chassis that we have
lying around so we're going to start
with the kind of case that most normal
people would be running and this is a
modest sized ATX Tower so this is the
nine hundred D Corsair has increased the
width compared to a normal computer and
they've also dramatically increased the
height and the length so I'm going to
line them up back-to-back so you can see
the sheer size of the 900 d this is a
Corsair carbide 300 are significantly
narrower go ahead get it from this angle
as well slick so I'm going to go ahead
and adjust that for you so you can
really see you could almost probably fit
two of these in here Rumble in terms of
the sheer volume so we're going to tuck
this one aside for now and I'm going to
show you one of our most space efficient
computers that we've ever had here at
tech tips and this is our shuttle x79 it
has a six core 39 60 X 32 gigs of ram a
quadrille 4000 and a 10 gigabit network
card and you could probably fit anywhere
from five to about seven of them inside
the volume of the 900 d with that said
you obviously can't do a dual socket
shuttle so there's a there's an option
that you have with the 900 d that you
don't have with that here is a Corsair
Vengeance e 70 so this is a pretty
sukham gaming tower and even this one so
with up to dual 140 millimeter radiator
in the top single 140 millimeter in the
back lots of air cooling I think it
supports up to quad fans in the front
something like that and this is what it
looks like next to the 900 d and we're
working our way up to the 800 d next to
the 900 d i have to go get one right now
though just a second so just for lulz I
hold down my rig so this is the
silverstone t jo7 next to it or in mind
the t
seven doesn't look like that out of the
box I still haven't put my glass panel
window on it or anything like that but
there's still like it could sort of
three or four inches there that is the
difference in height and then a good few
inches here look how much wider it is
how much wider it stances than the T jo7
which just has five and a quarter and
then sort of a border whereas that's
pretty much the width of just the Bay
covers on the 900 d never minding the
huge gap around here for airflow through
the front of the case now I'm going to
move my system and we are going to show
you a couple more size examples
including the BitFenix prodigy which is
sort of a gaming grade ITX tower with
similarly sort of way too many water
cooling options but not designed for
hptx parts so there you go this also
actually has a similar width to the 900
d I'm going to pop it up here for a sec
so you can see that the BitFenix prodigy
has kind of a wide stance and that's
because it actually holds the
motherboard in it the flat way as
opposed to vertically so I don't know
what the 900 these excuses actually I do
know what it's excuses the excuses it
holds a butt ton of hardware so there
you go that's how you could probably fit
about 3 prodigies and change in the 900
d and let's wrap up actually here one
more practical demonstration of how big
the 900 is and you know what it's big
but it's efficient I did make fun of the
cosmos too a little bit
when it was released because I said well
this thing is so big but the cosmos too
doesn't fit nearly the same caliber of
hardware in it that the 900 d does in
terms of liquid cooling I couldn't
figure out there I couldn't figure out
what the cosmos 2 is excuse for being so
big was because it didn't fit that much
stuff 900 D does we can actually put our
shuttle computer right inside it without
any difficulty so there you go we can
put a couple in no problem
there's your dual x79 solution
alright so let's wrap up with a size
comparison to the classic 800 d so this
is slicks personal rig
ah there we go alright and that's heavy
it's like how do you move this thing
around yeah so there's a liquid-cooled
800 d actually I'm going to put it right
next to it for size comparison first and
then we'll then we'll go so if the 800 D
is the biggest case you've ever seen
then the 900 d will be bigger and it
will be the biggest case you've ever
seen because it's definitely definitely
taken that crown from the 800 D so it is
wider taller and it is deeper and
there's all three of those things that
holds so much more hardware though
coarser hasn't wasted a cubic inch of
the space that they've added to the 900
D because to remember the 800 D natively
only supports a triple rad in the top a
single 140 in the back and you can mount
a 140 here but other than that the space
isn't nearly as usable as the 900 am
personally I don't miss the hot-swap
here because I find that the easily
accessible opening door down here at the
bottom and those hot spot of the will
not hop swaps but back planed SATA
