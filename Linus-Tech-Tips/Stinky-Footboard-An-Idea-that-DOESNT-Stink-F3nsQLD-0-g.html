brought to you by Western Digital Intel
and SteelSeries this is Luke Levasseur
and this is his stinky foot maybe if he
wore socks with his sandals he wouldn't
have that problem I love the name of the
product we walked by the booth and I was
like you've got to be freaking kidding
me what is this thing so basically it's
a d-pad for your feet that you can bind
any action to its four ways your foot
rest on it all the time so you don't
have to look for the button you don't
have to hover over the button it works
with any game any game that has
modifiers as well like such as shift
ctrl and alt it'll recognize it so for
games like that that's 16 functions
under your foot you can also adjust the
tension and the resistance of the board
we give you Springs so that you can
modify the feel of it some people like a
heavier feel or a lighter feel what else
why why why did you make this because
there were foot paddles available or
foot pedals available for PC already so
so the main reason why I made this is
because I tried other pedals and I was
hovering my foot over them or I was
looking and fiddling around the desk
looking for them I wanted something that
I knew where my foot was at all times
and I wanted more buttons that's how it
came about now we usually don't talk
MSRP on our channel because the usual
procedure is click the link in the video
description but I think based on that I
mean this is gorgeous the aluminum
construction here for a first run
attempt at building PC hardware this is
very very nice you guys know a thing or
two about what you're doing here how
much does it cost to get one of these
it's one 1999 and during the show right
actually here's there's a couple other
things I want to mention I love this
detachable cable folks detachable cable
if it's something lying around under
your desk you want that to be detachable
so you can move it around or if you
accidentally kick it and whatever it's
not going to break it not only that but
they've got a nice little S shape or C
shape to the router for the cable so
that means that even if you do pull on
it pretty hard there's a very slim
chance it's even gonna come detached
accidentally it's got nice rubber feet
on the bottom so it's not gonna move
around
whatever kind of surface you
have on it I mean this this thing what's
outstanding what are people saying about
it cuz you got a bunch of machines set
up here oh they're loving it they're
they're really liking it it's it's
something that they've never really
thought about most gamers are like oh my
god I can use my few arm gaming well
yeah you can and it's funny because
there's those there's gamers with
disabilities who don't have use of their
hands that game with their feet and yet
we never thought of this just for a
mainstream gamer is there any reason why
you could only use one of these at a
time like is there a software limitation
no not at all actually our software
recognizes two boards or more I
we have DJ's using five of them
guitar guys who use guitars they use
them as far away katar at Beck's pedal
people use them in Photoshop Illustrator
sky's the limit that is absolutely
outstanding so guys huge thanks to Luke
for doing this interview with us and
well bringing this to the market I'm
pretty excited about it
don't miss any of our PAX Prime coverage
remember guys were powered here at the
show by Western Digital Intel and
SteelSeries so a big thanks to them for
making it possible for us to be here and
thanks thanks a lot so there are a few
things that actually really weren't
covered in the interview but I've had a
chance to try it now
and it's awesome it's as good as you
might think it is so there's a bunch of
stuff like the springs that can be
adjusted in the bottom not only can they
be adjusted they can be adjusted per
spring so you can actually have
different tensions for the different
directions of the d-pad that you might
want to go in it's super easy to do so
there's an allen key just pop it out
swap the spring pop it back in it's more
intuitive than you might think I was
only sitting in front of it for about
five minutes but if you bind it to
things like melee that might be
inconvenient to reach or things like
push-to-talk or things like crouch or
prone or even WASD it's totally up to
you and the flexibility is incredible I
mean even if you're just doing work if
you were to bind like copy and paste or
something like that you're going to be
saving yourself keystrokes and hand
movements with something that your feet
would be resting on anyway it's
cool they also mentioned that the
aluminum plate here on the top is so
thick that you can't bend it by hand
even when it's not attached to the rest
of the board and they have a unit that
they've driven over seven times with a
car that is still in use right now so my
feeble stomp test here isn't going to
look that impressive</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
