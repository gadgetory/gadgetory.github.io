2013 is powered by Western Digital our
trusted gaming gear partner is corsair
vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCIX calm so guys it's day 3 of our
computex 2013 coverage don't forget we
are powered by Western Digital so we're
starting out at our home base here in
the WD booth we are giving away a ton of
stuff after the show guys remember the
more you watch the more you win check
out the links in the video description
for a chance to win all kinds of crazy
prizes just by watching our coverage of
WD here at computex so we're going to
talk a little bit about WD red and this
is not going to be a new topic for
anyone who's been following me for any
amount of time what you see on the table
in front of you is an example of what
exactly makes WD red special so this is
a bunch of different NASA's or network
attached storage devices you got to Bay
devices you got for Bay devices this
particular one is from a su store it
actually feels pretty pretty nice and
you can see right there there's a red in
there you can also see right there that
these Reds are packed incredibly tightly
so WD red is validated not only for
compatibility across a wide variety of
nazan closures but it's also optimized
for nas operation in a couple of key
ways so number one is that it runs
extremely cool so the thing about NASA's
is your packing these hard drives
together as close as you possibly can in
order to well save space but what
happens with that is there going to be
able to pass heat to each other and
sometimes they're not very effectively
cooled so that's why having a cooler
running drive in the first place is
going to give you better reliability
next thing is with 3d active balance
plus you eliminate the danger that comes
from lower performance as well as
potentially reduced reliability from the
drives transferring vibrations to each
other this is another thing that makes
them optimized for nas now if you buy an
azz and you buy a WD red drive and then
it doesn't work for whatever reason the
other thing that comes along with WD red
is premium support you got twenty four
seven support call a number talk to
someone there's probably something wrong
that goes beyond just the driver just
the NAS
probably something else at play because
there's a very good chance that well I
don't want to say his pet cock but there
you go um let's move on to the stager
dynamics lead core this is one of the
prizes that we are going to be giving
away if we can generate a hundred
thousand views average for our WD
content here at computex this is a
liquid-cooled htpc system that is fully
gaming grade so the graphics card in
there I actually have no idea what that
is but whatever it is it looks like
probably 690 or something along those
lines very high in graphics card the one
we're going to be giving away has a gtx
780 and I want to draw your attention
right over here to the similarities
between a computer case and an azz so
whether you're running in raid or
whether you're doing whatever it is you
happen to be doing hard drives do tend
to get packed together really tight so
all that same stuff that applies to WD
red and an azz enclosure applies in a
computer case as well in this case
that's for 3 terabyte WD Reds and they
are running in a raid array but being
able to avoid transferring that
vibration in that heat from drive to
drive is beneficial regardless of the
application now while the red may be the
newest member of WDS one size does not
necessarily fit all approach to hard
drives the greens been around for a
while it's available in capacities up to
three terabytes and what's cool about
the fact that it's been around for five
years is this besides the proven track
record it's also still winning awards
for eco friendliness the current
generation product actually these at RX
which we've tested not only maintains
the cool operation and quiet operation
of its predecessor but it also improved
performance dramatically and this wasn't
just marketing fluff we were running
real world applications like black
magics disk speed tests and seeing those
actual numbers coming out at us more
like wow that's actually really cool
because it's not all just about rpm
anymore now the other thing about a five
year history is the fact that well its
got that track record now some people
might have the perception that WD green
is an unreliable drive because the
reality of it is if you google WD green
drive failure or something along those
lines you're going to find a lot of
reports of failed dry
at the end of the day any device fails
that a mechanical device particularly
can fail and the person who it fails for
it goes like this and the person who it
doesn't fail for goes like this now this
is a concept I've talked about a lot and
having chatted with the w/d folks I
actually got a little bit of insight
into the actual members and it looks
like because they've sold 120 million
drives to date the reason that there are
thousands of complaints about it is the
fact that even though the RMA rate is
very low when you sell that many drives
someone is going to have a problem not
every problem is actually caused by the
hard drive manufacturer many retailers
do not pack drives correctly when they
ship them to an end user I have seen
customers walking into a store to buy a
hard drive chucking it in the bottom of
a bag putting that bag in their backpack
walking out to the bus stop and dropping
their bag on the ground you don't treat
a sensitive electronic device like that
so a lot of the time when someone says
oh hey I bought five western digital
green drives to them failed all forty
percent of them died sometimes there's
more to it than meets the eye and the
reality of it is with margins in the IT
industry if WD was taking back forty
percent of their drives they wouldn't be
able to afford these fancy uniforms that
our lovely WD booth member here is
wearing I'm sorry to put you on the spot
like that so in short guys WD green is
eco conscious not only in power
consumption where for you it might not
matter but by the time you deploy 121
million of them you save a few watts
here and there x 120 million is probably
going to add up but also the way they
manufacture them with lead-free
halogen-free materials and it makes them
optimal for not only standalone drive
applications in your computer or small
for a small form-factor enclosures where
you can still put a three and a half
inch drive but also things like their
own enclosures where they rely only on
passive cooling because the green does
run so cool don't miss any of our
computex 2013 coverage by making sure
you're subscribed to linus tech tips and
check out the links in the video
description you can actually get some
deals on WD drives as well as ways to
figure out how we can amp up the prizes
for our giveaway after the show and all
that cool stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
