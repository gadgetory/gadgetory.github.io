at guessing things you might have
guessed when we did the Vesta our one
limited edition system that perhaps we
would do a Vesta G one limited edition
system I am pleased to announce that the
Vesta r1 was a complete success we sold
out all five systems in a matter of
hours so we are actually going to be
doing a larger run of the Vesta g1 at
this point it looks like we're probably
going to do somewhere between 20 to 30
systems and they are going to be wait
for it painted green right right because
it's Nvidia yes okay so we have our
prototype system in the paint shop right
now but I wanted to show you what crazy
Russians been working on at his crazy
test bench so this is the Vesta g1 in
its most being tested form so I'm gonna
walk you guys through the specs we're
actually going to do two different
versions of the system one of them is
going to have a core i7 976 core
processor with 12 gigs 12 gigs of RAM
it's going to have a single GTX 590 and
it will have an ax 850 power supply now
the upgraded version is going to have a
core i7 990 X Extreme Edition processor
24 gigs of ram and dual GTX 590 s4 which
it will need an ax 1200 watt power
supply in order to run adequately so
we're going to be building for our demo
system the more basic model because
that's what most people will likely be
buying and I just want to walk you guys
through what else is going to be in here
so colonel a get some shots of the test
bench because this looks awesome this is
the GTX 590 we've got the g1 killer
sniper motherboard from gigabyte which
is going to match perfectly with our
with our geforce themed color scheme we
are not going to be using a stock cooler
we are actually going to be using the
coarser h 70 again and for our boot
drive we won't be using crazy Russians
fail ancient hard drive we will be using
a Corsair performance 3 series SATA 3
128 gigabyte SSD we will I don't think I
already mentioned we were going to use
the ax 850 in the base model and that
we're gonna have a blu-ray writer
actually most of the specs are fairly
similar to the r1 the big
reference is going to be the GTX 590 and
the other big difference is going to be
that we are using the x58 platform with
triple channel memory and a six core
processor instead of the quad core
processor and p67 platform that we used
last time around so this is just it's
more of a variation rather than being
like better or worse because the g1 will
be more suitable for things like video
encoding video rendering anything with
with 3d okay
not necessarily games whereas the r1
because it only has four cores is not
quite as fast for those things but it is
also very very fast for gaming these are
still gaming systems and I think that's
pretty much everything I have to say
about the g1 so you guys do stay tuned
as we are going to be doing some in
progress updates on the Linus tech tips
channel and I will show you guys as soon
as I get my hands on the case it looks
like it's probably going to be Monday
morning I'll get a chance to look at the
case don't forget to subscribe to Linus
tech tips from on boxing's reviews NCIX
pc videos and all kinds of other great
stuff thanks for watching
crazy Russian gave me a hard time for
forgetting to mention that what's so
awesome about the sniper board is that
it has hardware based XY that is a
creative CA 20k to chip and it also has
a hardware based a 2100 killer NIC card
built in with its own cache so that is
actually a pretty good value because you
don't have to buy a sound card you have
a headphone amped very very decent sound
card built right into the motherboard as
well as a dedicated gaming Nick</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
