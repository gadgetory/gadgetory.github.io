simple because of its extremely scarce
availability the GTX 690 you know isn't
as popular as people would like for it
to be there's lots of people out there I
know this for a fact who want to buy a
GTX 690 who want the ultimate
performance but cannot find one in stock
anywhere so I have one here today and I
want to treat this video as sort of a a
what can you do if you want ultimate
performance and can't get a GTX 690 sort
of video so it has come to my attention
that depending on which retailer you
look at NCIX
not being the one that I'm referring to
here a GTX 690 can go for as much as
$1,200 which is almost exactly the price
of Brie GTX 670 s so this is going to be
a head-to-head comparison in my most
recent my most recent suite of
benchmarks between 3-way SLI GTX 670 s
and a single GTX 690 I think we all
probably know which one's likely to win
at this point but in case you don't that
is the purpose of doing these kinds of
tests so I don't know if you can see my
fraps meter in the corner look at that
it's like exactly where the light is
making it so you can't see it or
whatever I'll tell you what it says so
this is battlefield 3 all of the tests
are going to be run at 1080p yes I am
aware that 1080p isn't necessarily I
actually don't know which way I'm going
anymore I am aware that 1080p is not
necessarily the ideal resolution for you
know very high-end graphics card setups
however I did notice that we do see
scaling in some of the games that I've
tested already where we're seeing more
than double the performance in 3-way SLI
as we're seeing with a single card so
that is a very positive indicator I'm
using the brand new driver from Nvidia
released on May 22nd so this is there
are 300 driver this is a wickel driver
that supports
on the GTX 670 and the GTX 690 you can
see I'm getting about a hundred and
hundred ninety five fps and battlefield
through this is all an ultra setting so
I'm going to be maxing out every game
The Witcher 2 battlefield 3 the elder
scrolls Skyrim and Crysis 2 and bringing
you guys the numbers head-to-head
between these two very ultimate II
solutions now I had really wanted to
test four-way SLI but I actually didn't
realize that the 670 does not support
four-way SLI so one of these cards is
not on the bench and we're just going
with these three so I have my reference
card my galaxy card and my other more
different galaxy card one that looks
like this with the glowing logo P sweet
so I'm finished my testing with the GTX
690 so in case you guys were wondering
what a gtx 690 looks like on the test
bench it's a little something like that
it's pretty cool start off the lights
you can see the glowing GeForce logo
here glows very strongly that's a very
cool as well he comes pretty toasty a
little bit of coil line not too bad not
as bad as my 680 or or any of my six 70s
but not as good as 590 which have
absolutely no coil line at least the one
that I that I have um overall not that
loud though about pretty similar to GTX
590 in terms of the actual fan speed
still got a game running on it right now
definitely quieter than the 3-way GTX
670 solution and consumes less power but
remember it's two GPUs versus three GPUs
cyanide ads I see that that's five video
cards but I was only running three of
them at a time so I'm just going to make
up my little graphs and then we're good
to go after I tell you the test bench of
course so this is a Radeon our 3d land
radio nothing core i7 3930k at 4.4
gigahertz with 16 gigs of kingston
hyperx ram at ddr3 1600 megahertz I also
have a muskan Chronos deluxe Drive in
there and I've got my gigabyte
is this thing it's a ga something rather
x79 ud7 so this is up to a 4 Way SLI
crossfire X capable motherboard that's
all powered by an OC z ZX series 1250
watt power supply easily capable of
powering those three GPUs actually you
know what it saw 2 in the morning and
I'm actually really tired so I'm not
going to make graphs you guys you'll
just have to bear with me so here we go
I actually have an upcoming video where
I plan to do some GTX 670 versus Radeon
7970 scaling which will be really cool
so one two and three weight
configurations for both seeing how they
compare but for this one we're just
looking at three x GTX 670 s versus a
single GTX 690 what is the better better
value proposition so you can see here in
Crysis 2 the 3-way SLI configuration
actually has a lower overall minimum but
a higher overall average but not by much
we're talking a 5 percent performance
advantage in battlefield 3 the 6 the 3
by 670 solution just destroys the single
690 so this is excellent scaling that
we're seeing in this particular game I
mean we've got an additional 25 to 30
percent performance probably about 25
percent performance from adding that
additional GPU so that is a pretty good
example of excellent scaling then you
can see the minimum is even higher
that's more like 40 percent outstanding
skyrim yeah those look pretty similar to
me within margin of error on this side
however that minimum frame rate is very
different so the GTX 690 was a actual
3-way SLI configuration with about 35
percent higher than the GTX 690 in terms
of minimum fps and I did notice that
when I was actually using it Witcher 2
is another one that scaled okay in terms
of averages with the 3 by GTX 670
configuration but the minimum was a
little bit lower well quite a bit lower
but something to bear in mind about
these minimums is sometimes when you
benchmarking your frame rates will dip
for sort of no reproducible or easily
explainable reason
and so there's a little bit about to
bear in mind as well personally I know
minimums are important to a lot of
people but personally I put more weight
into the averages especially because of
the way I'm collecting data with fraps
you can get a minimum that gets you know
if both cards dip like this you can get
one of them that records at the very
bottom of the dip because it happens to
fall on that split second and one of
them that falls here but that doesn't
mean the dip didn't happen so something
to bear in mind about fraps framerate
recording so thank you for checking out
my 3-way GTX 670 versus GTX 690
performance review I think that we can
see that three each by GTX 670 is a very
viable option if you really do want the
ultimate performance and you can't get
your hands on one of these bad boys
