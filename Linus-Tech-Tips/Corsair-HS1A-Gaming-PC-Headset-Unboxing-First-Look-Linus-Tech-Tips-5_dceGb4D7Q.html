product to unbox this is the analog
version of the course RHS one so it's
the HS 1a a is for analog and I will be
opening it up my expectation is that it
will be quite similar to the HS one
except without the built-in USB
soundcard which for some people may
actually be a benefit rather than a
disadvantage so here are the technical
specifications you want to come in and
have a look so a 50 millimeter drivers
that's an important one extra large
circumaural ear cups have closed-back
noise isolating design so those make it
very comfortable replaceable memory foam
ear pads also for comfort
moisture resistant microfiber covers
excellent so if you're sweating and
gaming and won't be a problem 3 meter
cable ok noise cancelling rotate rotate
in boom mic and that's pretty much
everything I have to say from there
amazing sound for intensive immersive
gaming ok
massive 50 ml drivers basically gives
you louder sound deeper bass all of that
good stuff that just cannot be achieved
because of the physics of the things
with smaller drivers so let's go ahead
and extract these from their packaging
I remember having quite a difficult time
with the HS one so hopefully the HS 1a
does not prove to be quite such a
challenge for afterall if you fool me
once then shame on you if you fool me
twice then shame on me right depends who
you ask if you ask george w bush then
that's really
how the saying goes but that's how I
always heard it all right there I have
extracted it now I have extracted what
appears to be a disc that doesn't
contain a disc so we have a quick start
guide which probably pretty much amounts
to plug the thing into the thing okay a
warranty guide which tells us that this
product has a two-year warranty which is
also indicated on the side of the box
that's it for that now let's have a look
at the only included accessories so
these are pleather e type ear cups these
use memory foam inside wow they're
really soft that feels really comfy and
nice so you can replace the stock
microfiber cloth ones with these if you
should so desire something to be aware
of is that not only is that going to
change the feel of the earphones against
your head but it will also change the
sound characteristics of the headset so
the plenary ones will actually isolate
outside sounds from you a little bit
more and isolate the sounds you're
hearing from the people around you a
little bit more will make them sound a
little bit more closed personally I
prefer the sound of headphones without
the the plaid three cups with the with
the microfiber cups but I prefer the
feel of the pleather ones so you have to
just find what works best for you so
here's what the headset looks like you
can see the boom mic is in increments of
approximately this much
it goes all the way down here just in
case you're one of those people whose
mouth is well down here so this is
probably the more useful level for most
people it is adjustable in and out so
you can make sure that this always
coming down in the right place for your
mouth in here you will see the 50
millimeter drivers you can see these are
also made of memory foam they leave
quite an imprint when you press on them
with your finger
but then easily relax back into their
standard configuration the hs1 I always
found very very comfortable that could
not possibly be a complaint I would have
about the HS one and so the same remains
true the HS one hey they've changed only
a couple things about the headphones
themselves you can see the color scheme
has changed slightly where we used to
have silver
we now have black so the HS 1a does look
a little bit different lots of padding
up here as well on the headband okay so
they like I said very very comfortable
overall build quality the HS 1a is
unsurprisingly about like the HS one
very solid so while we do have plastic
components here they feel very well
built and like no matter how much you
toss them around
you're not going to manage to crack them
or break them in terms of adjustments
you can see they've got marked
adjustments here in increments of
approximately that much okay so you can
make sure that they are going to fit on
your head even if your head is shaped
like this like if you have like a really
tall head don't fit just one well I
guess you could also have like kind of a
wider head too so so either of those
scenarios would even counted for here I
think that's pretty much all I had to
say about the headphones we also want to
just come in and have kind of a closer
look at them before we move on to the
included oh yeah this adjustment is also
present okay okay so let's have a look
at the volume control and mic so there's
a volume control dial right here and
then there's also a mic mute right here
so you wouldn't be the first person if
you accidentally bump this to the mute
position and then you know try to
reconfigure all your audio settings to
make them work to realize that you've
had hit that switch so watch out for
that it is useful though when you know
your mom is calling you and you have to
be like I'm coming and you don't want to
scream that into your mic so that's what
it's really for
you've got two standard 3.5 ml jacks so
one for headphones one for mic and that
is pretty much it so when it comes down
to it I'd say pretty much HS 1a if you
have a high-end sound card or really
pretty much any any after anything
that's not onboard sound card if you do
have an onboard sound card and you don't
feel like buying a sound card then the
USB is definitely a great option so
