oh yeah I can do that live no it's okay
don't worry about it
welcome to the LAN show guys we're in
Japan show you have the wind from Japan
we're gonna have to be a little quiet
today because really yep we're in the
lobby of Lake the most kick-ass hotel
ever by the way this is awesome this
place is absolutely incredible that's
great they gave us kimono things what is
that music that's you what it please
here it doesn't matter if it's me today
shut up
it deposit cheese um so anyway the thing
behind us that you guys see is like this
amazing little likeness koi pond yeah
there's like a huge glowing pond like
these salmon sized fish and like this
gorgeous like plant life and trees
growing out of the cliff face and all
kinds of cool stuff like that quick
salmon sized fish we're both pretty
tired the fish I caught was the size of
the salmon and it was a salmon was it a
big salmon I don't know just an average
disseminators average salmon but it was
delicious
don't worry about it
we have topics we do oh yeah we do have
topics but like okay here I'm just I'm
gonna show this to you guys because this
is straight up the most like the best
broken
no no that's last week oh this is like
the most broken worthless land show dock
that we've ever had it has literally no
actual nodes
it just has stuff that happened this
week that neither Luke nor I has had any
time to look at because I've been on
vacation and he's been covering for me
on vacation and all apparently ghost is
actually working on it right now trying
to fix it yeah ghost there's no yeah
we're like how much have you slept in
the last like four days Oh
four days probably six hours there's two
hours before I came on this trip and
then I've had two point three i'm
counting a hot dog as a third of a meal
so i've had two point three solid meals
in the last five days like most amazing
things I've ever had yeah but yes but
included brought chicken yes so that was
weird
that was pretty bizarre so I've been
super sick and so I haven't rested well
either so yeah we're we're gonna like
hang with you guys for a bit and this is
gonna be the LAN show this week welcome
to the tired show from Japan and
wherever you have the FreshBooks thing
sitting there this entire time
you know what fresh folks is cool man
whatever damn topics we have top right
cuz we should be intro yeah alright
I don't know if I fix the audio or not
it's like cutting out it's weird yeah
this kind of desire it's a new age thing
why
no don't do the live scene okay that is
one of you did do that FreshBooks
baby no big deal yeah you got this mmm
alright guys so you don't have a week
can you open twitch chat and taste like
tasting links we're awful they're asking
us to get Ed and Taryn on the show in
chat okay so we were supposed to fly out
of wherever we are back to Tokyo at like
6 p.m. at 6 p.m. instead we're trying to
reschedule our flight at the airport in
the morning so we have to be at the
airport at 6 a.m. so it is now almost
1:00 a.m. here we have to wake up before
yeah it's gonna be awesome
bye Swede what we were doing while we
were here was actually pretty cool so
for those of you who don't know we were
sent to Japan by Logitech to take a look
at the omron factory so everyone kind of
knows cherry right
they make switches that go in keyboards
and it's slightly less common I think
for people to know Imran
even though they're kind of like the
mouse which like the most microswitch
equivalent to cherry like if it doesn't
have armor on switches in the mouse you
might as well not bother
so Imran and Logitech partnered up over
the course of two and a half years to
create the Romer G switches and they're
both so proud of what they've done that
they invited us all the way out here to
actually have a look at
one of well actually both but we only
filmed one of them but the production
lines for every single romaji switch
that goes in well right now the logitech
c910 yeah that's it so that's what we
did we checked it out I was amazed at
how different the Japanese approach has
been to the German approach and we'll
give you guys more details in the actual
video but that's what we're doing here
so for now I guess I guess what I'll do
is go ahead and kick off our first topic
so this week
apparently the Apple watch reviews
landed actually I did check out some of
the reviews on the Apple watch and I
guess the the main summary here so like
some some headlines mm-hmm
so Gizmodo says Apple watch met a review
it's not perfect but it's still
something something that the general
consensus is its first gen and it's not
some first gen sort of mess about it but
you know it's a great start or it's
really cool or I'd love to have one or
it's a fashion piece and I kind of look
at this and I go how okay now to be
clear I may end up eating these words
because I haven't got one yet yeah I do
plan to get one I do plan to use it and
I do plan to give it a fair shake
because it's not like I just hate Apple
or something I really respect a lot of
what they do and I really like a lot of
their products but the Apple watch
unless I am somehow a complete idiot and
having a screen on your wrist that isn't
on without a motion activation gesture
is asinine
and seeing reading between the lines in
a lot of these reviews with pretty much
everyone across the board going it's
first gen it's first gen first gen
issues there are some first gen things
to work out what that means is don't buy
this yeah dude
by it yeah that's a terrible terrible
idea and if you buy it you're basically
dumb because what does first-gen mean it
means beta pretty much yeah I mean it's
not every first gen product has first
gen issues so when you say that you're
basically saying it's a bad not finished
product and to me it feels like an awful
lot of sucking up is going on right now
for the sake of making sure that you
don't get taken off Apple's favorite
journalist list because that list does
exist yeah we've never been on it so we
have absolutely nothing to you will
never be on it I think all they all they
have to do is watch this dream right now
and us ever being on it is a foregone
conclusion no I don't even have anything
against Apple will just never be able to
be on it yeah we're actually we're just
not cool enough I think not even does
that but like we're I think we're too
objective I don't even think that's it
because a non tech was on it their
objective but then it didn't a non like
end up working there yes but that
relationship came later hmm you know he
went from being a PC guy to buying a Mac
and trying it out and falling in love
with the experience for some reason
mm-hmm so that's like that's fine so
that's why we're not gonna keep it for
some reason so maybe it's not because
we're objective it's cuz we're sassy so
the Apple watch review here there are
some there are some good things that
came out of it so some people are
talking about how the functionality is
great how it you know feels really good
the fit and finish is really nice having
it on the wrist attracted a lot of
attention a lot of compliments but I I
continue to have the same issue with any
oh no
you
but I continue to have the same issue
with no I'm not gonna no I'm not gonna
miss a beat I'm not gonna let you screw
me up I continue have the same issue
with screens that are not always on and
battery life that is just barely
borderline like the funny thing is one
reviewer who gave a fairly overall
positive sounding review said something
along the lines of I equate it to my
experience with the first iPhone and
that raises a couple of alarm bells for
me number one the first iPhone was
revolutionary but wasn't actually a
great phone by any stretch of the
imagination and number two is that if
this is like the first iPhone to you
then have you even used another
SmartWatch because that was what was
amazing about the first iPhone it was
how different it was the Apple watch is
not fundamentally different from other
smartwatches in the way that the iPhone
was different from other phones at the
time so basically we dude it's got that
like menu
with all the circles I know that's
different well you could say stupid
things like that about Android wear - no
and the Associated devices that's that's
no this is different
you can like flip through the pages I
don't know of any Android wear watch
that I could spend 10 grand on that's
true woven hold on and you could
probably find a way like if you have an
Android we're watching gold and be like
it is now damn good yeah like if you put
enough Swarovski crystals around it I
mean lord knows I've seen people do that
with cell phone cases so it's probably
possible to bedazzle something with
$10,000 worth of Swarovski crystal that
needs to be a world record like is there
a world record for the most bedazzled
thing I think that's not an entire
bedroom that whoa no that was like done
up yeah is that what that thing was
called the bedazzler yeah I think so I'm
look it up bedazzler yep yep yep that
was it
oh man that thing was amazing alright
let's go ahead and move on to our next
our next topic here uh the new Mac but
wondering you know area to get about the
bedazzling good yeah we're not gonna
talk about the dazzling that this is
another thing that's the same this is
this is basically exists and post it
this is basically exactly the same
conversation we just had except to a
much greater degree because I could make
the argument that the Apple watch is a
justifiable product if you are an Apple
iPhone user and you want a smart phone
system and you don't want a pebble yeah
if all those things then you ins mert
watch Apple watch if that as well if
also have three hundred and fifty
dollars plus then Apple Smart Watch with
the MacBook I fail to understand how
Apple is receiving positive reviews for
this thing yeah
and I even skimmed through a few of the
reviews and I found things like well a
lot of the complaints about the new
MacBook like not having enough ports are
similar to complaints about the original
MacBook Air and how it didn't have
enough ports so it's good well actually
the original MacBook Air was a slow-ass
dog with not enough ports and that never
changed yeah it wasn't a great product
yeah it was revolutionary in that it was
extremely thin it was the first ultra
book like the first really good super
ultra thin ultra book machine but it
wasn't a great computer it had a fatal
flaw that made people upgrade them
pretty darn quickly when's the last time
you saw a Gen 1 err no and so I've got
people I've got dude when he pulled it
over the notebook notebook Oh Alliance
leader yeah that's impressive
anyways whereas the new back book is not
enough thinner than an existing MacBook
Air cripples itself and the big argument
that I see supposed professional
reviewers making are that it's fanless
it's as if the ux305 doesn't exist
that's what it is right that's the
easiest one right I don't know this
Lenovo ones as well ah
I found this one yeah Japanese Google
yeah Japanese Google well no that's the
new one yeah yeah this is if the ux305
doesn't exist I mean it's the same
fundamental hardware idea where you've
got what is essentially a tablet on an
extremely small PCB inside a laptop
chassis and then the rest of it filled
with battery and it's familis because
it's extremely low power and so I see
the same thing being done oh it's first
gen but it's good is it first Jenner is
it good because it doesn't have any
ports it's not very fast and it's
extremely expensive so you pay the early
adopter tax that's not that's not the
kind of thing that normally gets a
glowing recommendation oh yeah like iíve
done I'm fairly notorious for early
adopter attacks on certain things
yep IQs and whatnot but at the same time
every single time I've done it I've
recommended that people did not do it so
I just probably not a good idea don't do
this it won't retain value it's and you
know what I saw I saw a couple of
reviewers who managed to say you know I
like it I've got someone saying stop
talking about Apple no one cares
actually you're objectively wrong so
anyway I've had some reviewers saying
because okay hold on let's back up for a
second the reason we're talking about
this is not because this is brown we
haven't covered and not because the
Apple watch or the MacBook the new one
are particularly interesting products to
me personally but because
it's in much the same way that for all
the negativity that came along with it
gamergate was supposed to be about
exposing the problems with gaming
journalism here I see a big problem with
tech journalism where you have to really
read between the lines to find out what
the reviewer actually thought of the
product where they're saying it's good
its first gen it's expensive which one
is it it's either good and you should
buy it or its first gen and it's
expensive and you probably shouldn't buy
it you should probably wait a little
while so it's to me it's a big it's a
big problem let's go ahead and move on
to our next topic though not that I'm
giving in to pressure Netflix can now
ban VPN users with updated Terms &amp;amp;
Conditions you didn't even know this yet
did you
yep so there you go it turns out that
just like other competing services that
have gotten more serious about blocking
international users from using the US
service so annoying Netflix is cracking
down on I mean there's like half the
stuff on the Canadian Netflix I know
like actually this way but Canadian
Netflix sucks yeah it does
but the reason that Netflix has to do
this and I know you know I'm not I'm
telling you because you're my co-host no
because I think you don't know not that
we shouldn't cover it again I'm the only
reason why I said I know is cuz we've
covered this I know but it's because
Netflix hast has to protect their
ability to even negotiate content deals
with the IP owners and the thing is even
if it's the same movie the saying you go
across borders there's different people
controlling it that's right and there's
different there's different agreements
in place like for example let's say
movie X okay maybe in America it's on
Netflix maybe in Canada it hasn't made
it that far down the price chain yet and
it's still being shown on cable TV for
example
so that is why they actually have to
enforce it because if they don't enforce
it they're gonna lose the content
relationships that they have in the
territories where they're strong like
the US now for me personally I see a
future where this digital distribution
is just worldwide and everyone can
either suck it or well that's basically
the only option the thing is fine
they're gonna run into the problem again
of its it's not easy enough so people
just go start firing well that's exactly
it it has to be easy and it has to be
global but the problem is that the easy
solution came along so Netflix to me is
kind of like the steam of movies and TV
shows yeah and then all the other guys
are gonna kind of look at it and we're
seeing this already with services like
Hulu
yeah all the other guys are gonna look
at it and go oh holy crap that's really
profitable maybe we should actually
develop that business model and so much
like we're seeing with origin and you
play we're gonna see fragmentation to
the point where instead of one service
like Netflix you're gonna just have a
Netflix and Hulu and booboo and set
flicks and whatever all the different
things end up being called and once it's
actually managed by the owner of the
property then they can wait for whatever
global deals are in place now to
gradually expire and they can roll it
out worldwide because ultimately that's
gonna earn the more profit anyway yeah
and that's the only thing that's gonna
motivate any of this is looking at how
successful Netflix has been and how they
can cut middlemen out of the equation
and that's an excellent way to do it I
have HBO what is it HBO Go it's HBO
something else I think it's now now HBO
now sure I have they're two different
people I think they're two different
things but yeah HBO isn't necessarily
gonna want to push all their stuff to
Netflix so they're gonna have their own
service so you got people calling for
sex flicks in Gulu no yeah cuz you said
set flicks
oh I said set flicks whatever I guess
it's kind of quiet yeah I'm trying to be
quiet but I'm ending up getting louder
and louder I know I noticed that I'm
like an embarrassing person to be around
you are well I'm much like Taran
bringing water through security to two
times yeah both both times we went
through security yet that guy is such a
caveman just like you put him in any
civilized in the terminal to go to the
plane and he got like the the lady that
was serving us food to fill up his ball
with water I'm like you're gonna just
forget and then she just forgot I was
like BAM dude you didn't even take a
drink from it at all it's completely
like we were boarding in like half an
hour
dinner tonight was hilarious lately
there was okay I think probably the
funniest part of it was mrs. Leica we
actually on run treated us to about the
ball wrist dinner I think I can see
behind us this place is pretty nice yeah
this place is incredible
we had dinner here at the restaurant in
the hotel and we had our own chef you
know who sat in a little room yeah next
to the room where we ate and prepared
the food as it was brought out it was
how many courses 1111 courses yes we had
two dedicated servers you know in
addition to the dedicated chef and all
the food was like crazy yeah but I
I laughed internally when one of our
hosts told me that it was not gonna have
any seafood because the second I lifted
the like they have these paper covers
over your over your setting
the second I lifted it up there was a
roll yeah it's sushi me wrapped around
it it's like okay cuz I don't I don't
eat seafood so throughout the course of
the meal how much seafood was there
not a ton but there was a seafood well
there was the prawn tempura yeah there
was the sushi me thing there was this
and there was Morse if there was a
turtle or something yeah they wouldn't
tell me what it was till I ate it yeah
that wasn't much of it I was kind of
sketch about that yeah a lot of it
either
ah what else was there there was there's
little bits here there I would count raw
chicken it's kind of more hardcores
but okay it's not okay it's not some of
the stuff was like amazing though like I
really loved these they had these
bizarro not really candles but like
those are cool is some kind of fuel that
basically what what they do lighted the
whole thing torches instead of just like
a young wick and then there's a metal
bowl above it and it's basically like
pre calibrated so that you get the right
stink under it and then the right amount
of water and the right amount of food
and once the flame dies the food is
cooked Asik that's amazing so they had
like these soups these brats that your
meat would sit and cook in while you ate
other things and then once the flame
died you knew it was ready to eat and so
there was the mistake was amazing oh my
god the the beef like the tender beef in
the in the broth was amazing yeah yeah
it was it was pretty awesome I - was too
sketched out to finish his raw chicken
because that is pretty sketchy that was
a stroke of brilliance I'll let you talk
about your brilliance we had like the
hotpot thing that he's just talking
about when there was the beef and a few
other things in it it was like a small
it was 11 freaking courses there's
hotpot so it wasn't like the most giant
hotdog thing ever but I took Linus's raw
beef which he had ditched on to Ed's or
an insulin no fried chicken brought
chickens sorry cat which he had ditched
on two heads alone and excellent intern
dish down to me and
I cooked it in the hot pot stroke of
genius I wasn't into the raw chicken the
taste was fine because like the outside
was the outside was kind of like cooked
fish like it was like it was like police
think I think they like dropped it and
then immediately flipped it in a pan I
was on maybe a little more than blue
steak slightly yeah but it was not
cooked but it was not cooked
yeah like it was not cooked and what
they said was that at very high-end
restaurants in Japan it's okay to eat
there's other there's other stuff like
that too like the puffer fish you like
the puffer fan yeah oh wait is that
illegal no I'm not sure I think it might
be I don't know but yeah crazy stuff
yeah anyway so they claim that it's okay
so I did eat a piece but the texture for
me was just abominable like I could not
eat it I just I just about Hort all over
all the table and made a total mess of
everything
because that texture like I don't eat
raw fish either so yeah alright let's go
ahead and move on to our next topic
yeah boom LG may have accidentally
leaked an upcoming 8k iMac mmm
duh-duh-duh more k's personally I don't
see it as incredibly unlikely no 8k
would be what I'm a little over double
the pixels of 5k maybe maybe quite a bit
more than that actually whatever I
haven't done my own
I don't think it's the math is not
happening at the moment I'm sure someone
will correct us and congratulations for
using a calculator um but anyway I I
don't see why they couldn't do it they
already created a custom interface for
the 5k iMac so they've shown that
they're willing to do that so just
taking that and modified DisplayPort and
going even wider does nothing but add
design complexity and product cost
something Apple has shown in the past
that they're willing to do because they
have an unlimited R&amp;amp;D budget and they
have great margins so if they spend it
because a lot of a lot of companies if
they spend another three dollars on it
it like breaks their margins on that
product whereas Apple if they spend
another three dollars on it they'll
charge you another hundred and
everything's fine everyone's happy so
Apple has confirmed nothing about this
but I I guess that's cool I'm personally
not that super stoked on high-res
displays past a point I think that
moving to 4k is probably about as far as
I'll need to go at any size lower than
about 32 inches for I hear you and I
know your arguments a long time but you
haven't seen in a few screaming I
haven't seen an 8k screen but what I had
so know is a 5k screen from this close
what I've also seen is the evolution of
1080p smartphones to 1440p smartphones
and how little that mattered I know I'm
just saying
so while it could be marginally better
looking at how one thing that Apple did
extremely poorly on the 5k iMac is they
equipped it with a GPU that's just plain
not adequate and I even ordered the
beefier version with the r9 295x2 8 gig
card versus the r9 290 and these are
mobile these are mm cards with four gigs
of ram and
things stuttered all over the place so I
I don't know what GPU they would put in
an 8k iMac that would fit within the
thermal envelope unless they're going
back to Nvidia and they do that from
time to time yeah they do
just they can swap that's fine they just
do whatever they please got people
asking for 1080 K I guess we should
probably do sponsor spots yeah so yeah
the land show today is brought to you by
lynda.com lynda.com is the place to
learn online it's used by millions of
people around the world with more than
3000 courses available you can learn
things like web design or excel yeah or
video production or WordPress I should
probably take some Lynda courses on
video production then when those guys
talk it won't all just be completely
over my head you know what I still will
because I think they do it on purpose
sometimes you're just like go away I'm
pretty sure cuz I'll ask about something
or I'll say something and I've caught
them doing it to you before because one
of them was trying to make you think
that it took like hours and hours to
tween something in flash I remember that
as a long time but yeah those buttheads
anyway so photography visual design
business all kinds of stuff like that
and all the courses are taught by
industry experts you can learn at your
own pace and it's extremely affordable
at only 25 bucks a month to start but if
you're not sure if lynda.com is right
for you to advance your career or you
know make new friends when you talk
about cameras with people online okay
that's a pretty unlikely scenario the
point is if you're not sure if you're
gonna like it you can try it out for
free at whatever the link is you don't
have I don't I don't change seen through
lynda.com slash web and show I'm really
bad at changing scenes right there yes
you
he was telling me that apparently while
I was gone she straight up just didn't
show any guys the article super long
through the time
actually no I'm tired that actually me
to help I said made up maybe so it's not
doing we're not doing good you can make
a website even if you're super tired and
can barely talk and say maida because
it's a great space is that easy because
you can apparently use Squarespace yeah
yeah simple powerful and beautiful
they have 24/7 support via live chat and
they have templates that allow you to
make sure that your websites gonna work
on a mobile phone on a laptop on a
desktop or I mean probably even on like
a Jumbotron
you've been like an 80 K iMac you know
what we should do just to be like
complete butt heads is we should like
ain't go to a baseball game even like
pay them to put - community groups
website on the jumbotron yeah or
something like we should find a way to
find some completely stupid display and
put our put our corporate website on it
and see if it scales okay I'll be
wonderful we should try it I'm actually
I'm kind of I'm kind of I'm kind of
tempted to do that I'll be pretty fun
anyways it's only $8 a month and if you
get a year of it you're free domain I'm
just pretty cool there's like a sort of
13 dollar value or so yep so if you go
to squarespace.com and use offer code -
that you can save 10% so you can get a
free domain and save 10% and go to your
Squarespace you know what we should
totally do is we should turn offer codes
into like a popularity contest so they
should use like offer code Linus if they
if they if they like me better and they
should use offer code league we should
actually have to offer codes well that
would be I'd be I would be really
interesting if we could get some stats
from like Squarespace if they're like
yeah thirty percent of the people signed
up with Linus and seventy percent of
them went with Luke or we should have
lay Cara we should have like I like oMG
in general but I hate both Luke and - we
should have like a third option because
like knowing our guys they don't pick
that one squarespace.com slash haterade
and then and then there'd have to be one
more that was just worse be sitcom slash
bananas great so last one is fresh books
this is actually a relatively new
sponsor for us in general we've had them
on fast as possible yeah but I think
we've only had them on the land show one
so basically it's a tool for small
business owners if you say for example
you're like oh yeah and online too
accessible so not a hammer necessarily
unless you had an online hammer yeah
like a bad guy unless you save money
using fresh books because you're able to
properly invoice people and get that and
track that invoice and then they bought
it ready to buy a hammer with the time
you saved the money you made money okay
anyway the point is if you're a small
business owner late let's say for
example you're a plumber you can use
their you can use your phone to go ahead
and do things like log miles and log
hours so you can send out invoices
easily to your clients it's all easily
payable by credit card for your clients
so it makes life a little bit easier for
them and let me tell you as a small
business owner half of the battle
getting a client to pay is making it
easy for them like if you want to do the
you know wire transfer cheque dance to
you know save six dollars in bank fees
here or 20 bucks in transfer fees there
or you know in the case of my wife you
know a buck 25 for a check we all have
to drive to deposit or check I think
we've all collectively offered to like
have it deducted from our paychecks
I think legally we can't do that yep so
she will live with it anyway
the board the point is if you if you
check out fresh books calm slash wine
show you guys can try it out it's
extremely affordable and it helps you
manage both your time and your business
better so give it a shot and save your
money bye
save your money save your time and all
of that good stuff by hammer and buy a
hammer yeah
are we allowed to just say buy a hammer
with the money you saved yeah I guess so
we can give advice it doesn't have to be
good advice hammers are legitimately
useful tools I wonder how many let's do
a straw poll how many of you own it him
how many hammers do you own oh not how
many of you own a hammer yeah I want to
know how many I'm gonna answer this
mafia but I'm gonna wait till people
answered you ah I will have to think
because it depends on how you classify
it is a sledge hammer a hammer yeah
okay it's a rubber mallet a hammer it's
a mallet of subsection of hammer
well those definer this don't know off
the top of my head a meat tenderizer I
think would be a mallet but not a hammer
okay so then no so then no okay is a
hatchet a hammer because you can use the
back because you can use it as a hammer
I don't think so but it doesn't remove
nails in the way that I hammer well I
could use like my foot as a hammer but
my food is not a hammer
okay easier what is a hammer that's good
no you could that's stupid I have I've
used my palm as a hammer there's a door
in my place and the the doorknob is so
loose that the not bolt but the other
thing that I can't think of right now
because I'm tired will slide out and I
have to get it back in so I can actually
close the doors I just hammer it with my
fault
okay fathers ever talked about like
waves or toddlers well I I thought I
think don't confirm Scylla Klaus
oh yeah that's pretty important I think
we knew this wasn't gonna be a very good
sleep deprived in the middle of nowhere
this sounds like a horrible teen movies
sleep-deprived and in the middle of
nowhere I decided to go off the trail
into the cabin in the woods and there's
a koi pond and it's quite wonderful
actually but there's a murderer and they
get picked off one by one
yeah and like there's a chick with boobs
and for some reason she's in the shower
when every time someone attacks and then
when she's running away she could've
actually totally gotten away but she
tripped right yeah yeah which gave a
really good opportunity for like a
slow-mo of her tripping you know what
would be like a really cool like you
couldn't do it with a movie like prove
something pre-recorded but like a really
cool like interactive storytelling
concept whether it was done with with
live actors or whether it was done with
like episodic gameplay
is like what so the concept would be
that the audience cuz you you know how
you always regret not being able to give
advice to the actors please don't please
don't open that door you know please
don't come out of the safe room you're
in them you're in the safe room don't
come out of the safe room just stay in
there what are they gonna do to you in
the safe room that they can't do to you
when you come out of the safe room it
was obvious right so what if there was
like a concept where you could actually
like everyone in the audience had like a
tablet or something so it's like
twitchplayspokemon but with actors yeah
so you can actually dictate the terms of
the story and they could have some
preset branches but it could actually
play out a little bit different every
night so it's like twitchplayspokemon
both actors or like times
Dragons but not its dragon kids kind of
like choose-your-own-adventure
yeah so you know what the decision is
but you actually don't know what's gonna
happen until until it happens so I think
that would be a lot of fun like as a as
a play concept and then again as like as
like an episodic gaming concept so the
developer might not this tells me what
games multiplayer edition
hold on a second this could be cool so
the game developer wouldn't necessarily
just develop one path but they could
justify the expense of developing
multiple paths by making it a micro
transaction for you to try paths that
you didn't choose that is a business
mind did you just give people an idea
cuz it's really good I don't know that's
a really good idea it's really expensive
and a linkage is like you don't have to
pay every path yeah but they're gonna
make you pay for any path like you buy
the game or okay you make it free to
play and you can play one path for free
oh I play the game once I do it my way I
mean it couldn't be quite like
choose-your-own-adventure because I
don't know if you read many of those but
basically there was only one right path
usually and then like every other path
was like instant your head got cut off
and alligators ate you like it was just
go left or right right you trip you die
yeah pretty much
where's like I would you you should have
a guaranteed number of of decisions so
you should be guaranteed a certain
number of Forks and then I mean
obviously they can't develop you know
350,000 Forks so if there was something
extremely unpopular they do some sort of
generating tool yeah like this didn't
work you know not enough people chose
this can you pick another one or
whatever else the case may be but I
think that would be really cool and
remember this is something that wouldn't
have to happen over the course of a
normal sort of game timeframe it would
be more like an episodic thing so it
could actually happen over the course of
a couple of years more a few years much
like a like a
TV show might take a long time for the
story to develop so gamers could
actually play their way through the
story in real time and then maybe at the
very end or something you have the
option to you know buy an additional
playthrough and you can play it
completely differently or something like
that yeah
that's interesting rumor XFX r9 390
pictures I'm just gonna randomly see the
titles of things and then we can collect
it going on tangents um
right I guess like remember Jack are you
completely ditching the live actor idea
then and just going video game no I I
like the live actor idea better it just
seems a little bit harder to execute
likely give there's really good improv
actors like really really good improv
actors and you could just throw curve
balls I'm sure has anyone had done this
before it seems like the kind of I feel
like it's an improv thing but but like
probably not to the same degree right
yeah well you're talking about like
they'd have to have you know in the
universities where there's that like oh
well you have to input your answer to
the questions yeah when you use the
little white clicker yeah it would
basically be like that yeah
so there would be options so the actors
would have some idea what's coming but
you know what the the director or the
writer or the keukenhof shake it up a
bit if they're if thirty proper in
improv actors they can build a reactor
really well but the thing about straight
improv is that it doesn't have the
production values know of a proper play
know where as what I kind of envision is
a proper play where you dictate how it
goes well okay I think that'd be really
cool like imagine like a murder mystery
type play like they already do murder
mystery type stuff where like the
audience has some interaction but
imagine one we're like the murderer can
kill everyone and get away with it
because the audience chose all the wrong
things for the actors to do in the safe
room then you just like closes off the
air or something like that right yeah
like that'd be really cool yeah I think
that'd be really fun to watch um so this
is like super rumor because WCF tech has
actually updated the article in a very
very
the deceptive way so they didn't
actually manage to change their headline
all they did was add a note in the body
of the of the article so you have to
actually read it in order to know that
that's an r9 380 which actually says
absolutely nothing about new GPU
development for AMD graphics cards
because the rumor on the street right
now is that they are 9 380 is just an r9
290 which means this is just a rebadged
r9 290 yes so the RD that went into it
was probably an updated bios and a new
sticker design so yeah oh right skylake
yep oh we got it we got to close this
off pretty soon because we really need
to sleep at least a couple hours we have
eight minutes we have eight minutes all
right well then let's talk let's do a
series started that was pretty
interesting
LHC Large Hadron point oh yeah uh
someone for the first time in two years
the Large Hadron Collider has been fired
up there was a Windows Update yeah nope
no collisions but things are moving so
that's cool there wasn't a Windows
Update there wasn't a Windows Update
what are you talking about two years oh
you're rude um Intel confirmed skylake
lunch it's coming in the second half of
this year so that means we're not gonna
get it at Computex which is a little bit
I was kind of hoping for sky like at
Computex I mean the thing that you guys
need to know about skylake though is
that it's not gonna be like a you know
benchmark crusher like you know
something like Conroe was for example
it's gonna be an incremental improvement
it's not ddr4 on the mainstream yet it
was gonna use ddr3 and ddr4 elaine's
just like the existing as well II it's
gonna have USP one thing that I do
expect to see with skylake is support
for PCI Express based SSDs so nvme right
now there are very few motherboards that
support until 750 series SSD that was
launched recently we have
video coming on it there's very few that
support the two and a half inch one the
tuna half inch one the PCIe one that
plugs into a PCIe slot is fine very
widely supported um so I guess that so
about all there is to say about that we
really appreciate you guys tuning in at
this totally unusual time for the LAN
show we were planning to stream the LAN
show at the normal time but we had an
opportunity to take an earlier flight
but back to Tokyo so we could hang out
in Tokyo for the day instead of just
seeing the airport so we got it sounded
like a really good idea kind of figured
we'd go to Tokyo for the day yeah since
we flew all the way here yeah so I think
that's pretty much it guys
I'm gonna go sleep for nine hours yeah
I'm gonna go hit the can cuz I still got
a bad case of the travelers I'm doing
stomach thing going on oh gee and like
eating things that make me feel kind of
gross doesn't help no no I'm not helpful
I'm probably gonna hit my head on a few
things and then follow over oh my gosh
it's hilarious his six foot three Ness
is so out of place here like like the
taller I have a few taller friends that
would just be ruined here in the
doorways in our rooms here which are
awesome by the way they're incredible
Conan in the doorways of a room like
it's probably like to hear like he's
like this to get through I I was cursing
dumping something up and I like stood up
and turned and watch my head on one
we've been here but that one was that
one hurt
Taron had a pretty good one too yes a
little bit yeah
alright goodnight you guys and we'll see
you again next week we have to we have
to wait for it hold up this is gonna be
a little janky but
well I almost always do that too yeah
that's cool
oh I never took out the straw poll
results
Wow yeah for 40 to 43 percent of our
audience owns four or more hammers what
I do believe in is Linda - also fresh
book stock called slash windchill /
Wayne not a sci-fi show also in the who
sent us here thing put when okay good
