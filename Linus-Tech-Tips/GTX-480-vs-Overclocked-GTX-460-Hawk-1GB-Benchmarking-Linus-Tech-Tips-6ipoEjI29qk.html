the test bench and our total score in
3dmark Vantage is 23,000 3dmark so you
can see that the 460 Hawk with it's
fairly outstanding overclocking
performance my understanding actually
based on talking to a couple others who
have sample cards and to the team at MSI
is that mine actually was a subpar
overclocker for a hawk so this is kind
of a worst case scenario but even then
we're able to get within spitting
distance of a stock GTX 480 and the
difference in price is probably the most
interesting part because your Elana got
a bunch of stuff on my screen that
probably there's no need to show to the
entire YouTube audience 480 by the way
for everyone who keeps complaining that
I'm not running Windows 7 I am now
running Windows 7 on my work machine I
don't know why that was so important but
I'd get all these comments every time I
show something on my work computer and
know he's not running Windows 7 why
isn't he running Windows 7 well now I am
okay so 5 49.99 for a 480 and for a 460
Hawk wait for it
BAM - $69.99 so I mean yeah if you can
afford a 4 ID you know what yes it does
perform better yes it will continue to
overclock past what we were able to
achieve with a 460 remember that's like
maxed out but you can't really argue
with the value of something like a hawk
Edition card so anyway I thought that
was a pretty cool demonstration and
thank you for checking out my video blog
don't forget to subscribe
and that was GTX 460 Hawk vs. GTX 480
not Hawk</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
