and if you guys haven't noticed I've
been spending a ton of time playing
Fallout 4 on my twitch stream
twitch.tv/esa a far as how many of you
considering it made 750 million dollars
on launch many of you have also been
asking how the follow bomb is doing if
it's still running and how it performs
and if we're gonna do any builds like
this in the future well today I will
hopefully answer all of those questions
and more
the Logitech G 303 features a
lightweight design and advanced optical
sensor with delta0 technology for
precise tracking and RGB lighting to
match your setup click the link in the
video description to learn more
first off let's do a quick little
overview of the bomb I know you've
probably watched parts 1 &amp;amp; 2 of this
build log but if you haven't please
pause this video and check them out here
and probably here again so what has
changed well the two major things that
have changed is one aesthetic based one
and one performance based one first off
I added some crappy kind of meshing
over-the-air take holes in the bottom
just to try to make it look a little bit
more ghetto patched and then even though
the computer was mostly stable and ran
Crysis 3 for a bit the r9 nano was still
running pretty damn hot so I headed a
little cheero figurine thanks for your
sacrifice little guy and then put him in
between the top of the motherboard and
GPU turns out that my little cardboard
spacers were in fact too little this
change helped a lot and resulted in the
system being hot but stable which
honestly given all the problems works
for me now that that's out of the way
let's go out of the normal Linus tech
tips order and talk about performance
now instead of closer to the end of the
video in terms of total system wattage
from the wall we were sitting at about
284 watts while running the Crysis 3
skybox load test so what was running it
really close to the 300 watt power
supply we originally had in here and as
the Crysis 3 skybox test is hard to run
it's not the most stressful thing you
can do on your computer so I'm quite
happy that we are able to eventually pop
it up to the 450 watt version also under
the skybox load test we checked thermals
our Intel 6700 K ran at a surprisingly
okay temperature of 66 degrees and our
AMD r9 nano run at an unsurprisingly hot
85 degrees holding the system just
barely stable and allowing us to knock
out benchmarks at more or less 40 fps
across the board for Tomb Raider Crysis
3 and far cry 4 despite running them at
4k and pretty aggressive presets
some anti-aliasing settings now some of
you had admittedly probably quite a few
of you are wondering why the heck we
didn't test follow four on the fallout
machine that would make sense to
benchmark would it I hear yeah it would
kind of make sense but at the same time
I don't really think it's a game that
needs to be benchmarked first off it's
actually not that hard to run and
secondly I don't think you'd be running
it without mods on a PC anyways but then
what mods do you have installed
that coupled with it being an open world
kind of nature based game and some fps
caps based on physics and ways to fix
that and I don't know I think we answer
the performance question regardless and
that was the point
so what lies in the future for this
build and other potential themed builds
as well well by the time you see this
video this computer will probably have
been taken apart disassembled and
distributed but the case itself the
thing we created will probably live on
in some form or another maybe as a set
piece or something for other potential
builds unfortunately we weren't able to
execute on a star wars-themed build fast
enough I'm sorry but there is something
awesome coming up for Channel super-fun
on that regard so stay tuned up here to
see that and if you guys want to see a
themed build for your favorite game
movie show or whatever hit me up on
twitter at lou krymsk or la FR or post
on the forum or message Linus or message
Colton there Nick or Brandon or whoever
the heck you want Taryn that could help
if you want some like robot themed thing
I'd be pretty badass you could like move
and stuff I don't know
basically we'd love to hear your ideas
or challenges and I'd love to see you
guys doing your own as well in the
previous video I made a call of you guys
to like the video and share it around in
hopes that it'd be able to do more of
these in the future depending on how
many views and likes it got that's
actually a metric for us and you guys
proved to me that having fun with
technology and taking things to the next
level is what this community is all
about and we will be able to do awesome
crazy builds like this in the future and
I just have to say that I personally and
I'm sure the rest of linus media group
as well but especially me personally I
appreciate that
