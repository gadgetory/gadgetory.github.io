run a video signal like really far away
but you don't have a long enough cord
well easy right just by a longer HDMI
cable wrong if you need to go more than
about 40 45 feet you're gonna have to
get an expensive active cable or you're
gonna have to get a booster from someone
like Sewell direct that'll give you
another hundred and seventy-five feet
but what if you lived in a world where
your shed was like two miles away first
of all good on you great property you
got yourself there second of all we got
to get HDMI out there introducing this
Jake cheap wire that we found in a bin
we're gonna use this also the HD link HL
24 to send HDMI Watts not two miles but
however long this wire we found is
speaking of wires none Corsairs line of
unplug and play wireless peripherals
lets you gain with no compromises and no
wires check them out now at the link in
the video description
so let's gather up everything we're
gonna need for our demo first my lovely
assistant James Thank You James James is
equipped with aside from a stunning
intellect you really wouldn't know
looking at him he's got the HD link hl2
for sender so this is the base unit he's
got our video source a wet LG gram
because it's raining today
he's got a battery pack to power our HD
link sender outdoors because we're doing
this outside for some idiotic reason and
a big spool of wire for my end I'm gonna
need the extender receiver unit another
battery pack mind bigger than his and a
monitor because I have to power a
monitor I need to find some cover here
that needs to be bigger all right I
think there's really only two words to
describe what I've done here stable and
genius there we go let's go to the other
end only one small problem our wire
doesn't go to the shelter so these just
look like kind of standard almost like a
speaker connection so you can either
just go through the side like this or
you can use a banana plug so you can
tell it's already engaged because of
this blinking green light that means
it's sending data okay there's another
light on the other side that's gonna
blink when it's receiving enough data
okay all right trudging through the
wilderness no sign of civilization
anywhere but I gotta watch my TV and
thank God I got this black hole there
that taw about four by four really is
gonna smoke me if it falls guys toe pump
why did you run like that does it go on
the black one or the red one black bean
screen turned on yes James I've got a
signal yes yes with this technology the
send people could watch television now
you can probably even tell through a
video of a screen of a youtube video
that we have got some serious
compression issues here marques is uh
Chris penis is not up to its usual level
of crisp so here it is working we've got
video and audio this is at 1080p 60
Hertz which is pretty darn impressive
over a single wire here but it should be
noted that I wouldn't recommend a
solution like this for gaming for
example it's fine for watching TV but
there are going to be some compression
artifacts with you look up
there's some color depth loss and most
importantly there is some added latency
so the compression that happens in the
box on that end and then the
decompression that happens on this end
does add a significant delay to the
video signal
okay now you're probably thinking to
yourself sure Linus and also James
pretty impressive demo but this seems
like fairly ideal wire as far as wire
goes well first of all no not really
because something insulated would be a
little bit easier to work with we had
some issues with this making contact
with the wet ground causing us to have
some signal drop-off and second of all
to prove that you could really use not
just any wire but any conductive
conductor we are taking it to the next
level this is water regular tap water
and we are gonna send an HDMI signal
through it so to conduct this phase of
our experiment James took the included
banana plugs and then electrical tape
them to some cable that we had lying
around and all we've got to do is plug
this into here run my end into the
ordinary tap water no it's working so
now that we've got the laptop and the
monitor a little bit closer together
this gives us a better look at the delay
between the source and the output it's
not that bad but like we said before
it's not something that you'd be able to
game on but of course if we can get a
video signal running through regular tap
water over a span of about six inches
then with salt water which is about a
million times as conductive we should be
able to go much further shouldn't we all
right James let's do this so we've got
here two water cooling reservoirs and a
10-foot tube and you might be thinking
to yourself this is probably some kind
of
weird drinking game with like the but
but it isn't not yes not on camera now
we won't need a funnel no no we got this
here - ill tips check this out check how
much water's all the counter I put that
on the floor that's not what invented I
don't think it's been did you know it
doesn't need to be it's fine
you got you got to spread it out a
little more though I think this video
already has enough assault in it wait
what are you talking about okay okay is
that enough salt
Jesus luck no no I'm just regular like
this you're thinking of my custom Mexico
are we getting the salt down there wow
you can really see the salt move in
there some salt migration so we want to
see 10 feet of HDMI through water oh
crap
keep that away from the laptop that will
kill it for sure Oh mines leaking now to
this million times more conductivity is
not giving us million times better
results I was thinking we could do HDMI
over the ocean oh we're close we're
close we just need more salt
sticking them further in did not seem to
actually generate better results okay
should we shorten it just a little bit
more wait wait oh it's so close
still no clean signal come on I thought
for sure a million times more
conductivity okay
here's an idea oh crap
that wasn't the idea what if we just go
right into the tube maybe something
about the reservoir that's a lot of
Lincoln there we go hey we got it
1080p 60 Hertz five feet through a tube
now for our last trick we're gonna take
it to another level if it can pass
through a hundred percent water plus
themselves then it should be able to
pass through sixty percent water
Laser James split down let's try it
let's try this one on liquor the ring
will that work
there it is hey not bad there it is
there it is
HDMI through humans yeah let's get that
thumbs up in there yeah guess what I'll
bow a bow I'll shake hands no weird okay
so that was a lot of fun but if you've
stayed for this long you probably
deserve some kind of explanation as to
legitimately why this exists honestly it
seems pretty niche to us to for most
long-distance HDMI applications you
would probably use HDMI over Ethernet
since Ethernet is available in all kinds
of different configurations for indoor
or outdoor use it has multiple
conductors and it also has quite a
significant range but in an application
like a digital signage billboard out in
the middle of absolute nowhere literally
two miles away from the source this
could make sense
another potential pitch is to use them
as an emergency backup in the event that
a cable gets severed and you like
absolutely have to connect the two ends
together the HL 24 could be used for
that as well so nice within a niche but
definitely really cool to check out and
you know else is cool to check out I fix
it I fix it as leading the charge on DIY
