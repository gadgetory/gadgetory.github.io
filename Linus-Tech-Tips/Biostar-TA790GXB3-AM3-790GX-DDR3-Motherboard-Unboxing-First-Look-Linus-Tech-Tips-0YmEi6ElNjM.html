bio stars T series this is a ta 790 G X
B 3 so that means it's a 790 G X
motherboard it has support for the thin
M 2 X 4 processor and ddr3 it also has
support for a bunch of other sort of
standard features like SATA 2 HD audio
DVI Gigabit Ethernet and let's have a
look at the back so you can see they've
they're calling out some of their of
their features so you've got onboard
power and reset buttons Japanese solid
capacitors ok something about an
overclocking utility and then default 3
overclocking modes in the BIOS so that's
kind of neat so they've got some
overclocking profiles in the BIOS the
thing about a BIOS card board is that
you're not going to tend to see a whole
lot of unnecessary bells and whistles
but what you do get is a solid board at
a very very reasonable price so here's
the users manual which is mostly in
English and then I think include gi
includes some some random stuff Japanese
Arabic Russian polish Portuguese Spanish
Italian and French and Germans but
that's only like the index it doesn't
actually include any of the instructions
in those languages so there you go and
then we've got a drivers and utilities
CD ok download the latest off the BIOS
star website don't bother using that
then we have one molex to SATA power
adapter two SATA cables that are yellow
and one IDE cable and that comes in a
nice little cable tie velcro thing that
you can use for cable management in your
case when you're done installing the
motherboard we've got an i/o shield
alright and then let's get to the
motherboard itself so while the
packaging leaves a little bit to be
desired you'll find that like all
biostar boards once I get the tape off
once I get the tape off come off tape
wow that's a long piece of tape that
they're using you know just in case the
package flies away ok so once you get
the board itself out it's a fairly sharp
sharp looking board so they've used like
a green orange and blue color scheme for
this one and so why don't we start with
the CPU socket you've got support for
am-3 CPUs which includes the 965 Black
Edition AMD's current flagship CPU okay
then you've got hot at the dozen one two
three four I'm not sure how many phases
the power
but it looks like somewhere between four
and five based on how many of these
there are alright so then we've got its
to couldn't control we've got support
for your typical ddr3 dual channel
memory so four slots for that and then
we have our power of connectors in their
usual ideal locations with the 24 pin
along the right hand edge and the four
pin power connector up at the top left
now in terms of SATA connectors we've
got C this is the kind of thing this
that you will tend to see a little bit
on value boards is that the layouts
might not be exactly optimal so you can
see that the top SATA port is actually
going to be covered by a dual slot
full-length graphics card now if you
have a single slot graphics card then
you're good to go you can use all six of
the SATA 2 connectors but if you do have
a dual slot graphics card you can
probably only use five of them shouldn't
be that big of a deal you got your clear
CMOS switch here one IDE port here are
your onboard power and reset switches as
well as your color-coded front panel
switches three USB 2.0 front panel
headers I really like that I don't think
2 is enough because a lot of cases have
4 front USB and then if you want to even
have like a card reader and then and
then what yeah exactly that's it so if
you wanted to have a card reader you
wouldn't be able to but if you have
three headers you can you have four
front USB and the card reader I love
that so then we've got a floppy
connector here then in terms of
expansion ports we've got one PCI
Express 16x slot two PCIe 1x slots and
three PCI because again it's a value
board so you're gonna be expecting
someone using this as like an upgrade
err board to have some legacy PCI stuff
that they want to carry forward with
them you can see there's a dinky little
heatsink on this chipset right here and
that's all that's really necessary for
it but then we've got a fairly beefy
looking fairly large heatsink on the
actual 790 GX chipset itself so that
pretty much own okay there's one
auxiliary power here so that's just I
think this is going to be highly
optional okay so it's only if you're
running an extremely high powered
graphics card here and even then you
probably don't need to use that so then
on the back okay like most 790 GX boards
we do have support for onboard graphics
we've got DVI and VGA and then we have
two ps2 ports for USB 1 Gigabit Ethernet
and then we have support for Wow okay I
haven't seen
aboard with a-79 egx chipset that only
has three audio ports so microphone
headphones and then I believe that's a
line in our line out and I think you can
also use software to configure it for
five point one with no mic so thank you
for checking out my quick unboxing of
the ta 790 GX b3</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
