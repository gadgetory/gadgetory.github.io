brought to you by AT&amp;amp;T having plenty of
experience with oculus development kit 1
and recently acquiring the development
kit - I was quite excited to get some
hands-on time with Samsung's gear VR
outside of the gear VR unit we have a
focus wheel on top allowing you to
easily change focal distance on-the-fly
a touchpad and back button on the side
which will serve as your built-in
navigation tools a mounting plate in
front which will allow you to mount your
Note 4 device which will hopefully
support more devices in the future and a
speaker in the back which I personally
didn't really get to experience it
allowed expo hall but is probably ok but
due to it being a phone it does offer
Bluetooth functionality so you'll be
able to connect a controller or in this
case of Lou toothed headset to augment
that functionality another thing to note
is that there are absolutely no cables
attached to the unit which is fantastic
is you can now freely spin around in
your chair without worrying about any
cables nice this is especially nice for
situations where the scene is playing
out all around you instead of just in
front of you this freedom while great
does not come without a cost however
you're now intimately tied to the note 4
is 30 to 20 milliamp hour battery
it's 2.7 gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon
805 processor and 3 gigabytes of RAM
which will result in a limited duration
of single session usage and eliminate on
the devices performance for instance I
don't expect you to be able to play
elite dangerous or stars isn't on this
thing but to give it credit you'll
hopefully be able to play games like
portal half-life and GTA on it soon
along with the opportunity for Samsung
to partner with valve on a game
streaming app and while there's no
information about that whatsoever
anywhere I do kind of hope it happens
well they weren't able to directly talk
specs with me I doubt that apps
available from the oculus or Samsung
would directly lower the potential
resolution of the device and we should
be getting a similar overall experience
in terms of low persistence to the
oculus rift development kit too
considering that the oculus development
team is making the SDK for gear VR as
well this bodes quite well for gear VR
as the note 4 offers its monstrous 2560
by 1440 P display which while I have
very limited experience with it looks
fantastic well that's about it I hope we
get one of these for the office so I can
try it out more extensively and let me
know in the comments down below what you
guys think about this kind of nicer
audio voice over style show coverage
thanks for watching I'll see you guys
