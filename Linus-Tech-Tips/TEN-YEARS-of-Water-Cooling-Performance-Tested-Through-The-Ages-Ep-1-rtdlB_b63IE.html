okay whatever if you don't like all the
series that we have now then just treat
this like a standalone video because
it's cool either way the idea here was
to take top-of-the-line products from a
particular category
we decided on CPU water cooling for the
first one and measured just how far
we've come thanks to improvements in
design and manufacturing welcome to
episode 1 of through the ages CPU
cooling blocks mass drop is now
featuring the AKG M 220 semi-open Studio
Headphones
check them and other drops out at the
link in the video description so the
first step in this undertaking was to
gather up CPU blocks from as far back as
we possibly could by teaming up with
Swift Tech we were able to scrape
together seven of their nine blocks
going all the way back to July of 2005 a
span of over 10 years so time to get
started testing them right now that
would have been too easy the intention
was to use a modern test bench to
eliminate as many variables from our
tests as possible and as the astute
among you might have already realized
Intel's latest flagship x99 platform not
only didn't exist yet but Intel wasn't
even the performance King back then so
we needed to source modern mounting
brackets for many of the blocks time for
some DIY metal fabrication step one was
to glue the hold down plate drawings
that Swift tech modified for us onto a
piece of sheet steel then we went to
work with the aviation shears cutting
the outside edges we drilled out the
middle as much as we could with a step
drill finishing off again with the
aviation shears and finally we Center
punched the holes and drilled through
them with a titanium bit cleaning things
up a little bit with the dremel
this was pretty tedious but we didn't
want to bother our friends over at proto
case to make them for us if we didn't
have to and yeah so the apogee GT Zed
required a specific plate thickness and
a pretty precise cutout so they ended up
whipping one of those up for us in the
shop so so much for that but anyway
thanks proto case as always you guys
were lightning fast on the plate fits
perfectly
let's introduce now then the test bench
that we're using we used an Intel Core
i7 6850 k-6 core processor with a 246
millimeter squared die and a 140 watt
rated TDP though it should be noted that
according to this Tom's Hardware article
it's closer to a hundred watts in the
real world this might be important for
later the rest of the components in no
particular order are an Asus x99 deluxe
- 32 gigs of Corsair Vengeance ddr4 a
random DTX 980ti that wasn't connected
to the water loop making it somewhat
irrelevant and our water cooling gear an
alpha cool Nexus XP 45 triple 120 mil
rad with Noctua industrial PPC fans a d5
pump with an e KX top and some the 3/8
inch premium flex tubing we used icy
diamond for our thermal compound so each
block was mounted using m4 screws with
nylon washers to achieve the desired
mounting pressure yeah we were a little
bit approximate here but as I think
you'll see from the results it likely
didn't matter much idle temps were
recorded using I 264th logging tool
after 10 minutes then load temps were
recorded using a 3-minute mean average
after allowing the water temps to reach
equilibrium room temperature was
maintained by our zone control HVAC
system at 23 degrees Celsius Wow that
was boring
alright let's meet our first contestant
this is the legendary Swift X storm
designed by CAF R himself and sold to
Swift tech for mass production back in
Oh 5
it features an impingement design with a
mid plate sporting 35 micro Jets that
blasted turbulent water into 35
corresponding divot
in its thick copper base it was a
nightmare to manufacture making it very
expensive and its performance while
superior on bear small die single core
processors fell quickly behind as
dual-core and quad-core CPUs with
integrated heat spreaders became the
norm
the story behind 2006 is Apogee was less
about raw performance with 1 degree
Celsius being optimistic and more about
optimizing for enthusiast CPU design
trends and ease of manufacturing thanks
to the relatively simple uniform diamond
pin matrix in its copper base it was
less restrictive contributing to better
liquid flow rates for multi block loops
it handled and continues to handle large
CPU dies with heat spreaders better than
the storm and thanks to its cheap
injection molded acetal top it was one
of if not the first legitimately
mass-produced CPU water coolers this
right here this exact one was my first
block when I got into water cooling
about ten years ago the follow up the
apogee GT looks outwardly identical to
the apogee but thanks to manufacturing
improvements and an enthusiast inspired
tweak to bow out the base with a thicker
o ring to compensate for intel's
less-than-stellar IHS flatness it boasts
slightly better performance not Swift
Tech's 1 to 3 degrees Celsius from our
measurement but I'll comment more on
that in a moment
the Apogee GTX released shortly
afterward was basically a hot rod
version of the apogee GT with the same
copper base plate and then marking that
was focused more on the cool-looking
aluminum top that whoo-ho I guess that's
probably why I couldn't find a working
one for this video don't mix your metals
kids moving on the apogee GT Zed brought
about significant improvements in
manufacturing that allowed the small
diamond pins of the Apogee GT to be
shrunk to only 2
250 microns for a claimed performance
gain of two and a half degrees holy crap
too bad on our 68 50k it really didn't
amount to much but back to my earlier
comment about these disparities that are
starting to pop up the GT Zed design was
as much about optimizing for the dye
orientation of Intel's then flagship QX
6700 quad-core as about anything else a
trend that we're likely to see continued
the apogee xt from 2009 was from what we
can measure the last big step forward in
CPU waterblock performance sure it was
kind of restrictive but it looked
amazing and thanks to its redesigned
upper housing with the inlet centered
over a much larger 250 micron pin matrix
it crushed its predecessor with our
numbers nearly backing Swift tax claim
of a three degree improvement as long as
you had a whopping eighty dollars to
spare apogee HD which followed two full
years later rocked tweak 225 micron pins
30% lower flow restriction to improve
GPU block performance and according to
Swift tech 2 degrees better temps though
I suspect we'd have to pull a 39 60 X or
something out of our hats to observe the
specific optimizations that were done to
achieve that result I'm actually still
happily running a limited edition
gold-plated Apogee HD in my personal rig
which leads us then finally sorry we got
lazy and skipped the apogee XL to the
apogee XL to the current flagship block
that is only available as part of Swift
xh2 20 and h3 20 X 2 kits it features
the same two 25 micron thin slash pin
base plate as the XL but tweaks the
Inlet and outlet design of the top cover
for improved flow characteristics Swift
tech claims about a degree and a half of
performance over the HD but we saw a
mere half a degree improvement in spite
of the five-year-old design of the HD on
a modern processor leading me to believe
that mo
of the performance to be gained with
future water blocks will come from
compensating for the weird
idiosyncrasies that Intel introduces
with each processor generation rather
than pure thermal transfer improvements
though I will be interested to see if
the prototype SKF block that Swift Tec
showed me at CES will change my mind the
fins on that sucker are so small that
they can only be produced by shaving
copper and bending it up into little
tiny fins maybe there will be another
leap forward after all I'll be sure to
update you in another 10 years or so so
