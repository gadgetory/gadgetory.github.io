worst case scenario acoustics of the gtx
480 so I'm not this PNY card here and I
thought I'd do sort of a more more like
a realistic video so first of all you
should check out the other video it's on
my channel minus tech tips and so here
I'll put the camera close and i'll let
you listen so that's what the fermi
sounds like when i'm running a TI tool
which I realize is a very very old
synthetic benchmark okay it's running it
2,000 frames per second and here are my
EVGA precision settings so you can see
that at stock speeds under load the GP
runs at about 72 degrees and fan speeds
about sixty eight percent now something
you should notice that I'm in quite a
chilly room and that this is an open
test bench so you put the Fermi in a
case add five degrees at least and you
know you warm up your room to the point
where you can actually sit in it without
three sweaters and you're probably
looking at another to the three degrees
so I'd expect this to be running more
like 80 degrees or the fans need to
actually be running a little bit higher
so you can see I'm actually going to go
ahead and cover up the fit beef intake
fan of the Fermi here alright so I'm
going to put this on there and I want
you to listen to what happens as soon as
the temperature goes up to what what I
expect would be about 80 degrees and I
want you to listen to what happens to
the fan speed as soon as we get to that
kind of a temperature also please note
the GPU usage is around 75 to 80 percent
for this particular benchmark I'm gonna
run a game in a little bit but i just
wanted to show you this for the sake of
seeing it okay so here have a list of
nominees reached 80 degrees
so it's easily the loudest thing in the
system but not unbearably horrible
personally I'm a I'm a water cooler so
I'm not into a whole lot of fan noise so
I'd be putting a full cover block on
this thing I'd recommend you do the same
but there you have it that's what the
Fermi sounds like at about 80 degrees
just running a TI tool with about eighty
percent GPU usage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
