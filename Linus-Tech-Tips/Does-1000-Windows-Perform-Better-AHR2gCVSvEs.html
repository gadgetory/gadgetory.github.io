Windows for a normal price or you could
buy a copy of Windows for like twice as
much that had extra features like the
ability to join a domain support for
more RAM or even the ability to head of
video as your desktop background but did
you get any additional performance for
your money fair question and one that
was asked many times only to find out
that no no in fact you did not but what
about Windows server operating systems
surely a $1000 version of Windows would
have some kind of under the hood
performance tweaks right in today's
video we're going to find out
we now have awesome posters available
for line of tech tips hex quickie and
channel super fun check them out at the
link in the video description okay so if
we're measuring the performance of two
different pieces of software the last
thing we want is some kind of a hardware
bottleneck so we're using a
balls-to-the-wall configuration we've
got a 59 60 x8 core processor from Intel
we've got an X 99 deluxe 2 motherboard
from Asus 128 gigs of quad-channel ddr4
memory from g.skill a gtx titan XP from
nvidia and X 540 10 gigabit NICs from
Intel and finally for our boot drive we
are using Corsairs latest MP 500 nvme
PCI Express SSD then I set up like a
little dock so that with two separate
installs on two separate drives of
Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 I
could go through exactly asterisk the
same setup procedure down to the order
of reboots and the order of application
and Driver installs to create the same
basic state for both of these operating
systems then any time I'm measuring
performance of something like rebooting
for example or a game if I have to
screen capture I'm using the HDMI
pass-through of this BenQ monitor going
to an avi offn capture card over to a
separate computer so nothing that I'm
doing affects the performance of the
system whatsoever no xsplit no nothing
like that so at this point I've actually
finished running all of the windows 10
numbers and you guys are joining me for
the exciting part where we compare
Windows Server 2016 and find out if it
can blow Windows 10 out of the water or
not so we got our screen cap going we
got our first benchmark ah here it goes
the i2 cache and memory benchmark Wow
some of these are like down to the
point decimal place of a gigabyte per
second identical so our first result is
in and it looks like pretty much within
margin of error the performance is the
same let's keep going time for
everybody's favorite benchmark fitnah
bench
1371 okay past mark cpu mark how
exciting we are a little lower on the
server operating system let's go ahead
and log that and move on to this mark
Wow okay so disk mark results are in and
things are getting pretty boring we come
in a little bit lower on the server 2016
machine but not really in like a big way
or anything like that
okay sorry
oh so that's uh that's the adder results
Wow
very similar maybe gaming will be a
performance revelation okay first game
benchmark ashes of the singularity 4k
high DirectX 12 here we go show me the
big difference in three minutes and 15
seconds so curiously ashes of the
singularity did have a significant
performance difference but Server 2016
was much worse than Windows 10 CL rise
of the Tomb Raider death okay last
benchmark doom at 4k Ultra so far gaming
is not looking good for Server 2016 okay
then so outside of games where we saw a
server take a bit of a beating actually
they performed pretty much the same
within margin of error
but this shouldn't be much of a surprise
to anyone who's familiar with the term
kernel so the kernel is the very core of
the operating system that's responsible
for memory management and for allowing
the hardware itself to interact with
other pieces of software and drivers and
vice versa
so Microsoft actually reuses
fundamentally the same kernel between
their server operating systems and their
consumer operating systems and this has
been the case ever since Windows XP
where an ms-dos based kernel got
replaced by the Windows NT kernel and
the advantages of doing this were
several so it streamlines development
while dramatically improving the
stability of the consumer product I mean
what was the point when you really get
down to it of spending extra to maintain
two parallel kernels so that one of them
could be good and one of them could be
like kind of unstable it also
dramatically improved interoperability
have you ever noticed that driver or a
software application that runs on
Windows Vista generally run on Windows 7
without too many hiccups that's because
they're based on a very similar version
of the Windows kernel so what are the
differences some can be easily reversed
like control-alt-delete to find into a
server operating system or pretty
animations on your you know windows when
you drag them around on the consumer
ones some of them are artificially
imposed like RAM limitations no remote
desktop connection no domain
connectivity for home additions and some
of them actually come from third-party
developers who might lock down their
software from running on non server
versions so our data replication
software is an example of this or even
from hardware companies who don't want
their hardware running on non validated
versions of Windows so the onboard Wi-Fi
on this board for example even with a
cheat through device manager manually
pointing it at the driver file simply
refused to work but the biggest
difference comes down to the massive
amount of code that goes into adding
features that would have
little to no value to the average home
consumer so things like enterprise
networking functionality or the ability
to nest virtualized operating systems
within other virtualized operating
systems virtualization exception so the
bad news here then is if you spend $1000
on your operating system you won't get
any performance benefit the good news
though is that for $100 or even less if
you're the Linux type you are already
getting the most out of your hardware so
congratulations
Squarespace I don't know why they call
it Squarespace because you could build
your website any shape you want it could
even be a square or even a rectangle yes
my friend square a rectangle but what
all Squarespace sites have in common is
they look gorgeous and they work across
any device you could want and they make
it easy to build they offer live chat
and email support 24/7 it's inexpensive
starting at only 12 bucks a month and
every website comes with a ton of great
features including commerce cover pages
which allows you to have a beautiful
one-page online presence in minutes
support for Apple news format so you can
have a Squarespace blog module and
access like millions of potential
readers and the best part is you don't
have to take my word for it you can
start a trial with no credit card
required and start building your website

Amazon in the video description join our
forum and I think that pretty much oh
right t-shirts we have t-shirts and we
have other videos I did this completely
