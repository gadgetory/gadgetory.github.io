the win show yeah we actually have a lot
of great news topics for you guys today
six of which we might cover two or three
of them
yeah we'll definitely cover a couple of
them the most important news topic I
have though is that I am taking a real
vacation sort no you're not no no well I
mean no elves I will still be you will
be taking real vacation time and you
will not be yes working at Linus Media
Group yes but it's not really a vacation
I have a bone to pick with you on the
vacation now hold on a minute no no no
no no no no no no okay are we really
gonna get into this like half an hour to
roll the intro master I think that's BS
full disagree hold the screen look we'll
talk about this later and disagree
okay so what imma let you finish so go
ahead I just I don't think it's a
vacation what are you gonna so okay tell
them what you're gonna do with your time
off okay so with your time off to be to
be like my vacation
they're super clear okay so from Monday
to Friday of next week okay I am NOT
going to be at the office yeah time off
yeah
vacation because I'll be on vacation and
vacation time probably I'm okay so I
plan to spend a few days reorganizing my
garage and my attic and going furniture
shopping for my kids room yeah that
sounds super exciting yes well no it's
not exciting but I'm excited because I'm
going to be on are you making me
self-conscious that's a question for
yourself no no no no no no you are what
is the difference
cuz you are you were so you were so
happy that it was your first vacation
yeah but that's see that's not the point
though like when I say first like look
it's vacation time they travel all
around the world all the time that is
not a vacation vacation okay tell you
what
that's fair but do you me this do me
this kindness okay okay google vacation
while I explain why traveling is not to
me a vacation because when I travel it
increases my anxiety it decreases my the
likelihood that I will be able to
actually go places that I want to go and
do things that I want to do so it's
interesting because it doesn't say
anything about decreasing anxiety or
anything well why does specifically say
an extended period
leisure and recreation which is not
sound like you do okay whoa hold on a
second so I plan to play badminton twice
that week instead of once
okay that is that it that is I will give
you perhaps a lot leisure I will give
you that but definitely recreation yeah
also I am definitely like 9 of 10 Rhea
dicted to 1602 a deacon right now and I
plan to play that yes sir
yeah I'll put it back up oh wow
especially one spent away so it doesn't
have to be but it specifically says
leisure or Recreation and you were
planning on all for organizing your
garage also cleaning your attic
definition number two definition umber
to the action of leaving something one
previously occupied
I don't think Andre D from floatplane
chat
I'm with lioness any time away from work
is vacation if normally you'd be working
and then it replaces its vacation you
need to do work hold on a second is if
you're doing I take vacation and mow the
lawn yak now oh you know yak now I've
misread that is that relaxing for you
though some people enjoy yard work it
smells ass is what I'm saying I think I
don't think you realized in the garage
of the Attic is gonna be relaxing for
you it will be relaxing when it is done
because right now my house is in such a
state that I actually cannot relax in it
so you're like using your vacation time
to buy relaxation ongoing in the future
it's like a investment vacation
investment okay but but the reason that
I'm calling this my first true vacation
since starting - Media Group is that for
the first time I am NOT going to be the
one to bank up the content beforehand or
make up the content when I get back so
do you know about this have you heard
about this yeah so Riley James Anthony
Alex and Jake are all going to be
working
together to produce six
ltte videos plus the usually scheduled
tech linked episodes while I am gone so
theoretically I will be away for a week
with no stress and nobody will call me
on my cellular telephone and I will not
get any emails and I am really gonna say
we have under reminders to call you
about flow plan stuff reminder every
time I walk past you hey you know that
six months where we like didn't put live
on the website I'm making up for it now
we just hey we create a new feature
actually you should show that that is
that is we actually not have but we at
least have a mock-up like this is on the
pre that's gonna be different I believe
it's on you keys local environment oh
okay so this will be a while probably
not no no we're making no promises
because that was definitely making no
props what's best for Luke yeah no
promises hey Luke not today have
two-factor authentication
Oh six weeks six weeks go by hey Luke
when are we gonna have to factor
authentication I don't know six weeks
it's like it's like he lives in on a
different like on a different space-time
continuum than everyone else where like
it just it holds still anyway no I'm
just teasing you because and I can now
because actually we're rolling out new
stuff like every other every other week
right now okay so I'm gonna switch over
to your screen so this is pretty sick I
think I think and obviously I'm a little
biased here but I think this looks
better than YouTube's Federman I think
this is Beth best theater mode I've
personally ever seen okay so the
chunkiness in the video by the way is
rapid pausing yeah show how different
things get affected don't don't worry
about the chunkiness in the video dad
not pretty it's so smooth full dark mode
but you can still see the original
thumbnail the
your comments come over to the side so
you can still chat about the video live
not cool I think that's really sick that
there's a download button so you can
still interact with it like you don't
lose a lot of your features you can
still see the description so someone
says click link in the description you
don't have to leave theater mode you
don't have to leave theater mode to
comment honestly that's one of the
things that I really like when I'm
watching a video is actually reading the
comments oh do you mean remove that just
just in the oh reading the comments
while I'm watching it so having
something that's just off to the side
full dark mode really nice really clean
I think I think it looks fantastic yeah
looks awesome there's also tons of other
stuff coming on the weight searches sir
people give me now trust me if that
approach worked there's all kinds of
stuff it doesn't we tried that at one
time and then we had to spend a really
long time on doing that now we're in a
good spot search searches coming on is
like really close as I believe I've
talked about before transcoding Peters
here I'm not gonna give dates but like
real soon it's been a really long time
coming I rod from BS mod says wow dude
line to start on time ish no or half an
hour late we just started like 10
minutes ago yeah I'm very sorry
oh he thinks were on time for 4:30
daylight savings yeah so about that no
um so that there was a time change over
here so actually that's great for a lot
of the world order and we were early
today oh my goodness oh that's terrific
great alright so you know what why don't
we why don't we actually do a tech topic
here let me do a tech topic 120fps of
the movies let's get the title one other
way yeah you know where that's a New
Year's resolution I'm a honey this
resolution 8k so timing now yeah look
some of us some of us are so the
realization of New Year's resolution
some of us are so great already it takes
us to come up with the New Year's
you know I get it I get a kick out of
this because so many people I saw on on
the livestream that I did today
where I was going around and talking to
the writers about what they had planned
for while I was gone
I saw so many comments about like you
know oh you know Linus is being so nice
to his staff like what's wrong he's like
talking to them so respectfully and like
interacting them with them like a normal
human and I'm just kind of sitting here
going like yeah
obviously the egomaniac like you know
james t kirk character that I play is
like it's it's hamed up for the camera
honestly honestly I like myself I do
like myself I'm not I'm not like a
self-hating person or anything like that
but the whole like yeah I'm so great
that it takes me two and a half months
in spite of how incredibly intelligent I
am to come up with a new year's
resolution it's just funny it's just
really funny I think it's funny so I
think I think everyone here does to it I
can understand how it might be difficult
as an audience member considering I've
had and family members worried about
this really different
I was definitely threatened with a knife
yeah yeah yeah for an extended period of
time but there's there's like there's
ribbing between friends and I think when
you've worked together for a long time
and you understand you you you you get
give and take so you'll get like
grandiose praise and you'll get ribbed
for stuff yeah and it's everything's
fine you know it's funny during the
Linus reeds mean comments there was we
ended up with a thread on the fox news a
thread on the forum yeah so we ended up
with a thread on the forum yeah that was
like full tinfoil hat that because
everyone laughed during I think it was a
comment about what a hopeless narcissist
I am or something
like that and someone in the background
is like yup or like they laugh or
something like that they were like this
is this is them like reaching out that
they are in are a hostile abusive work
environment and I'm kind of sitting here
going do you have any idea how talented
these people are if they didn't want to
be here they wouldn't be here nobody has
to work here no one's that gunpoint
that's kind of true H we actually have a
really great job market here in
Vancouver particularly in the media
production industry like if someone like
Taryn decided he didn't feel like
working for the monsters that are Linus
Sebastian and Yvonne Howe and Linus
Media Group Incorporated evil corporate
entity that it is you don't think you
can get a job like come on so let's just
even consider consider that a lot of
people that work here dropped more like
traditionally better jobs to come work
here when times were like not as good
and then they're still here way way way
way later where there's probably a
reason like we're trying to do better I
mean the thing the thing for for me is
that I actually don't really like going
out of my way to to talk about the
things that are are great about working
at Linus Media Group because and I had
this was another like like really I
don't know what to call it crazy hurtful
bizarre understandable and yet
everything is working exactly as
intended thank you for that there that's
my okay it's my emotion cloud that was
like yeah anyway there was that there
was a comment on the 10-year anniversary
livestream that Yvonne and I did did you
watch any of that whole thing of course
you did okay so when we talked about
people starting at the bottom and how we
don't offer like gigantic mondo salaries
because what we're looking for is in
fact I don't even think we mentioned
that part because it was more true at
the beginning anyway we mentioned that
our expectation is that the people who
work here would do it for nothing and
we're not saying that
do do it for nothing we're just saying
that they would do it for nothing
because when we hire we are trying to
hire passion first attitude first and
then you know what we can work on all
the other stuff yeah because if you're
passionate and you have a good attitude
then you know you get a whole bunch of
people like that in a room that's ones
that's when things happen and so someone
interpreted that to mean that we
basically pay slave wages and they were
like I'm glad they mentioned that that
really reveals a lot about them as an
employer I'm I would never work there
then everything's working perfect we
were a match not made in heaven
yeah if you remember what was it one or
two streams ago you talked about well
I'm saying you as in them and then now
I'm talking to you that got a little
confusing but if they remember as of two
streams ago we talked about how all the
original members now own yeah houses of
some form domiciles don't yeah let's go
with that
because they're absolutely quite varied
yeah I think it's okay you know so
here's the world we're happy with you
not a play I actually blame you for part
of this perception because you used to
complain about your compensation on
camera a fair bit but see here's the
thing he knows that that's a sensitive
spot for me because I actually do care
about making Linus Media Group a place
that makes sense for people to work I
want to be a real company you know like
that kind of thing and he would rib me
for two reasons one is that he knew that
it cut me pretty deep and two in the
early days I'm pretty sure Luke in the
very earliest days was actually making
less than legal minimum wage yes yeah it
was okay but it also rib before it
because you know my real stance on it
quite well
but that's exactly the point and that's
this isn't me this is very important
when you're viewing these things is like
lioness and I have talked about this
stuff extensively off-camera
knows my realest ants are my real stance
on it is that it's completely fine we
literally have a scheduled annual
discussion called the annual employee
review here where we talk about how
everything's going and talk about
compensation and all that stuff because
we don't want all the time to be about
that we want every day to be about going
to work and being passionate and doing
what we're excited to do and then once a
year we go well how was all that
excitement for you dot hey how was all
that work for you and why don't we why
don't we balance them you know make sure
that everything makes sense so so and
also to be clear Luke always made salary
wise more than legal minimum wage so
while he was at Linus Media Group I take
no responsibility for what NCIX with
about what yet so yeah that's a that's
actually pretty good to be clear it's
important with that said I think
especially when the forum was having
issues over you were definitely working
more hours than but this was and like
this is where understanding stuff comes
into plates were you paying rent though
I was were you I'm pretty sure it was a
pretty sweet deal though it was an
amazing deal ok ok that was like I
mentally just mental math that into part
of like the compensation from but that
this is part of like van home-cooked
meals and which were like that was like
an extra 20 bucks a month there's so
nonsensical it whatever it was I
remember it didn't pay for the
ingredients for one meal and probably
just as big as both of them so my wife
was was off on maternity leave with my
first son my only son excuse me well the
only one she knows about anyway I'm so
she just kidding um so so my so my wife
was on maternity leave so she was
cooking all the meals for me and her and
him and so it wasn't really that much
more work to throw some extra noodles
and some extra beef and some extra
veggies or whatever in the pasta except
I would happily
so one to two meals a day and just go
hand I still actually kind of remember
like the negotiations here where Luke
was like well like you're kind of doing
it already anyway so like really it
should be kind of closer to materials
cost Yvonne estimates the materials cost
gets it way under and like okay sweet
you can always tell that you've offered
this guy too much but he's like okay
because if you try to hold mattress it's
like let me get back to you and you get
like this trust me I've had it both ways
with him yeah yeah I mean it's been a
while we've been working together for
nine years close to eight or nine years
at least eight at least at least eight
has six and a quarter of Linus Media
Group yeah and then over a year of NCIX
so yeah it's been it's been so we've
we've had some exchanges even on this
show I think there's only been a handful
of times that things have actually
gotten kind of heated but like even on
this show I think we've kind of lost it
a little bit with each other so feel
well that's rest assured us disagreeing
on things was like the content of the
land show for the first thing it's
gotten harder though because actually
you spend a decade in close proximity or
working towards the same goals with
someone and having many of the same
experiences and it's actually kind of
amazing the way that you start to
mind-meld yeah like Luke and I will have
more similar opinions pretty much across
the board whether it like and I'm
talking controversial topics you know
whether we're looking at religion or
politics or the capital punishment or or
like whatever it happens to be you know
one of us will be going and doing some
reading or whatever on our own time and
then we'll be like hey yeah so I've been
like thinking about this I've been you
know meditating on the merits of you
know firing squads versus lethal
injection or whatever the kinds of calm
sessions that you do not have in mixed
company and you know what we'll just
start to kind of like build on each
other and it's like okay yeah we're okay
we're on the same page wait a minute
is tonight yeah the thing yep
I totally forgot that's very fun not
it's how set up by the computer is set
up the monitors are on the internet is
working do you have like I have
controllers there okay so we should
announce it then sure like we're doing
it right yeah I mean right can we get
there and then it might take a little
just like so it'll be a typical Linus
and Luke yeah
afterparty yeah the first after-party in
okay see that OBS just a little bit not
a little bit that's weird right easy
yeah now it's back okay okay I have a
question was audio going during that and
yeah what did the stream do okay flow
plane chat we need to hear from you guys
about what exactly happened there see I
still don't see the fries look is that
it that's it and lots of people in flow
plane are saying lag and dead
interesting so that was that was OBS a
hundred percent I'm gonna stop audio was
going so we have the stream playing on
both YouTube and twitch so I'm gonna
lose that right now and just fire up
task manager here interesting so we've
been trying to diagnose an issue with
the streaming pc cuz like the weird
thing is the six core 12 thread
processors should be more than enough
but every once in a while we get these
spikes you know what I kind of wonder is
I actually wonder if it's a USB issue if
we should switch to all PCI Express
capture cards and see if that's it
because when you have more than one
capture device over USB on its a shared
bus and I think there's one of them like
one controller that we have two streams
coming in on you can run into issues now
had that problem before so apparently
the audio was fine mm-hmm so that makes
sense it's probably the capture device
interesting we should also just see if
there's a firmware update anyway
anyway so tonight it's going to be the
first after party in what has to be more
a year a long time we are going to be
playing some broforce
yeah and it is to my understanding
anyway going to be the first live stream
from my new place Luke's new house yep
it was crazy how this worked out because
you proposed this whole idea last week
did I I think I remember exactly what it
was but it i didn't realize but
yesterday was when my internet got
turned off at the last place
so it was like actually not even an
option to stream from the world i had to
move huh i realized that like so is all
your stuff out now then not all my stuff
a very large percentage you'll see i
guess
cool the vast majority of my books my
whole computer setup there's no
furniture everything important yeah is
everything i like on my like day-to-day
there's some kitchen stuff still left
behind there's still like storage ii
kind of things to left behind the
bookshelves are all still there moving
socks hey it really does I love that you
like have been moving over the last week
and then rolled into the office on
Monday and had to move out of your
office ridiculous I've been moving every
night even when I stream I move at least
a few boxes every night just cuz I'm
trying to like if I do have to do one
big day where I like call in the troops
I'm trying to make it the smallest big
day I possibly can right and it's
getting more like more more chips and
beer less actual carrying heavy things
yeah more realistically would be like
one or two trips and then mostly hanging
out because that's the point it's
getting to and I had a lot of help last
night actually from the roommate that's
moving in and some mutual friends cool
which was awesome but yeah it's it's
it's it's getting pretty set up the
networking situation is interesting oh
really I guess you'll see as well okay
I've never had networking through the
walls before yeah and I have my I made a
video on it you guys check it out it's
actually pretty cool I have my big
wooden paneled networking board yep so I
you still have that yeah I thought that
was just like a thing you made for the
video and then you don't throw it away
those all my hardware oh I bolted my
hardware
there okay that was like I wanted to do
it anyways I don't this has been a long
time ago so I don't expect you to member
the story but I want to do it anyways
then I was like hey she make a video to
this and you were like yeah sure so I
used some like yeah that yeah yeah
DIY ghetto networking wall a renters
solution now has to be converted into a
person who owns a place solution so yeah
I put all that hardware on a board and
then got like crapped on because hashtag
J's two cents did it first yeah that
that's sucked J was cool about it but
the community was like wood so yeah that
exact board looks exactly like that plus
a few Ethernet cables that I've now
removed so it looks like that again -
the fiber box because that's not mine
right so I took the fiber box off and I
brought it to the new place this switch
is gigantic
yeah yeah that's at like a 48 ports
which isn't it yeah it's Hugh why did
you get a 48 ports which right cuz you
used to run lands and stuff yeah yeah
right I actually used it to fairly high
capacity a number of times um and I got
really I got a really good deal I
believe you yeah yeah if you bought it
you got a good deal on it because that's
the kind of bloke you are I got a really
good deal on the place too and it came
with furniture but really you're gonna
see it's like a nice couch and stuff the
the the place has one of those like
networking cubby things it's like a like
a white door you open the door there's
like all your networking into the house
goes in there and then the network
installers put their boxes in there and
stuff got it and there's a little bit of
space okay Oh a little bit of space you
say yeah yeah not enough space at all so
I really don't know what I'm going to do
but yeah there's there's like a few
Ethernet ports plugged in that's another
thing there's eight Ethernet ports in
the house well that's pretty good that
is pretty good that's there's actually
quite a few cool a box they gave me does
not have eight ports my switch is giant
and doesn't fit in there right
so you just I mean you just need like a
like an 8 or a 12 port switch or
something like that
but even then I'm like already running
out of space in there and I need a pee
in there and stuff so I think I'm gonna
have no you should put your a pee
somewhere else and your ap is kind of
like that Rin is actually very
centralized in the house all right well
I'm gonna come yeah yeah all right oh

slash LTTE go there play around with it
and start protecting yourself from
potential bad times I'm talking very bad
times data loss is even less fun than
like now I'm not even gonna it just
sucks yeah it's bad the things that
would be you know it's you just don't
want to talk about yeah
pulse way that's what we want to talk
about yeah we actually have a really
cool project coming up for pulse wave
very soon we're gonna be shooting like
like actually like a commercial spot for
them oh and it's good oh wait I know if
I'm supposed to talk about this okay
Paul swing is a real-time remote

my favorite things about it aside from a
remote desktop functionality is the the
fact that you can just set it up to give
you notifications for just basic stuff
like whenever our main storage server
goes under 15% I get a ping and I can be
like hey what move stuff to the vault

I actually I now I now I have to shell
for our own stuff I'm sorry do you feel
bad about this though no not at all it
is freaking awesome
um okay so I've got a new update for you
guys all my friends are like scrambling
to go and I didn't even push them really
it's kind of cool that's awesome I'm
pretty stoked escape VR so for those of
you who came out to previous LTX events
you probably already know how busy our
vr space was very busy it was bad long
lines very bad so last year we did not
account for how many people would be in
line to check it out and some people
ended up basically standing in line the
whole time
so this year we've made it a big
priority to have a bigger and better VR
experience including some partners to
help manage these systems so that's why
we're really excited to have escape VR
join us at LTX 2019 featuring Dreamhack
they're coming all the way up from
California and bringing their escape
room styled VR games with them so we're
still working on the final details but
we can confirm they're gonna be in a
gigantic 30 foot by 40 foot space so
that's 10 meter by 13 meter for the
Europeans out there and with different
multiplayer experiences that's all um so
there's the possibility for one large
game remember you're in a group so you
actually work together yeah or two
smaller grouped games within the space
and all the games will be able to have
roughly two to six people at a time so
make sure that you guys are hanging out
on the LTTE forum I've seen a ton of
like grouping up threads other people
are like linking up before the show so
they know each other coming and they you
know they've already chat or hang out on
the forum and from experience of doing
cons that can be really cool having a
buddy at a con is like actually sweet
we've even seen people like carpool like
hey I'm here is anyone coming along this
way like no I've seen a ton of them
that's pretty cool yeah so it's pretty
sick so having having some people that
you want to hang with while you're at
the show would be definitely good highly
recommended I'm not actually coming out
and recommending like effectively
internet hitchhiking but like I'm just
saying people are doing it no I
understand where you're going I'm just
clarifying cuz that's illegal there's
different it's like it's an internet
thumb oh yeah kind of thing yeah but it
is you're right it is not actually
hitchhiking yeah one thing is J and I
did a
early similar it's definitely not the
same there's definitely clearly
different things about it but Jay and I
did a fairly similar like get through
the experience
yeah PR thing in Vegas and it was very
fun it's really cool to be in the same
area with someone else who's in VR and
the issue with that I've always had with
escape rooms is that the puzzles are
designed to be easily reset to not be
damaged by the idiots who go through
there you know a hundred times a day
yeah and so pretty much you end up with
some variation of unlock this padlock
using clues that are super obscure and
it's yeah yeah but my biggest thing is
that they're aggressively designed to
make you fail yes and it's it's it's
frustrating because you end up with
adventure game logic yeah where it's
like oh I just had to move my head in
the shape of a clock and then I would if
I adjusted the angle just right then
these things would line up and I'd read
the numbers and it's always just numbers
and a pattern it's just it's annoying
where are we with VR the possibilities
are endless
speaking of endless possibilities the
ltte store finally has enough shipping
volume that we managed to negotiate a
deal if Canada Post and we have users in
Europe reporting shipping rates as low
as seven to nine dollars that's super
cool I've had people complaining about
that for so long but like you've all had
people complaining about that Thank You
Luke yeah yes we're aware so we are
aware we've been working on it the thing
is the the efforts that the lmg guys
have been going through to make this
stuff awesome have been pretty intense
and like the quality of the shirts and
the quality of the stuff that they're
getting out it they are genuinely very
nice shirts now which is really good I
like my actual favorite shirt right now
is the constellation shirt from the
fermentis oh no nevermind it's it's an
I'm just gonna see if we have all the
sizes looks like no we don't have any
triple extra-large it's just a really
nice shirt it's a really nice quality
shirt the prints really nice like it
the quality of level has skyrocketed and
to do that it seems we've had to do a
lot more stuff ourselves
there's a lot of growing pains including
crazy shipping rates as we've learned
and and mostly learned but they're
they're getting taken care of which is
really cool
speaking of things getting taken care of
we should really take care of the topic
that was the subject of today's man show
I said that was my new year's resolution
I got totally derailed immediately
broken immediately broke it okay so the
GTS 1660 has launched we don't have a
review up yet because I don't know we
just weren't in that big of a hurry no
actually that's not what happened so
Nvidia didn't seed these two partners
and actually most of the partners that
we typically work with like a sous for
example just straight-up did not have
cards early enough to seed them to us
for a launch day review so EVGA came to
the rescue and managed to get us one but
it was only a couple of days before
review before the review embargo lifted
and the cold hard truth is that when you
are trying to do video rather than a
written article it just takes more time
so we I think the video is going up on
like Saturday or Sunday or something
like that in a nutshell though it's
alright I guess
unless you're after performance per
dollar in which case you should probably
get an hour X 580 what else do we have
windows updates suck less now to the
original article here is from ARS
technica comm a windows up 10 updates
will apparently now check for
compatibility issues when they are
installed and though but they will roll
back if there's a problem so here's what
I want to know if they detect a
compatibility issue why do they install
in the first place we were talking
earlier about how we like see eye to eye
and a lot more things lately what the
heck and like okay I'm just waiting for
the headline of like someone's computer
is now just looping in this endless
process of update rollback update
rollback update rollback because
something Oh matter of time just it's
gonna be a nightmare absolutely a matter
of time
first Windows 10 home users can also now
defer updates for 35 days same as
Windows 10 Pro and enterprise should be
able to do that forever if you want well
okay
hold on a second if you like really go
into it there should be away forever
there should be a way so by that logic
should you be allowed to defer your
measles vaccine forever because why your
computer computer isn't gonna make
everyone else it's because it puts other
people at risk okay so do your rights
end where someone else's begin does that
is that is that equivalent here could be
if you had like because abroad that's
exactly where I was going with that if
you have an army of non updated
computers you could actually be putting
the in huh now hold on a minute
you could be putting the entire Internet
at risk you remember when CloudFlare got
hit a couple of years order of the
frickin internet and I'm starting to
agree with you and when the internet
goes down it's more than just like oh no
I can't read my al mail anymore like
there are critical critical services
that run over the internet now that
could mean the difference between life
and death
for someone it's yeah I know it's it's
nowhere else to play yeah yeah this
laptop this laptop has nowhere to put
the pen I grudgingly agree with you
there's it's been interesting have you
heard about the stuff where fire
departments have started they started
using their own cell phones because the
fire department has like a data cap and
there will be a disaster and they'll use
all their data and then their inner will
get shut off so they've had to start
using their cell phones then the
firefighters individually go into crazy
overages it's like it's happened a few
times it's super bad okay fire unrelated
thing I'm sure
there are some evil firefighters that
exist out there but by and large if
we're gonna generalize firefighters or
heroes so like we actually need to not
but like you did not charge firefighters
for saving life the point you brought up
about like super important
infrastructure things running on
networks is very true firefighter police
hospital if you want to come back to
like the basic services right
they all run very heavily on internet so
now let's have another conversation
should Google be required to provide
security updates for their Android
operating system for far longer than
they do now because most of the large
boughten bought based attacks that are
occurring these days they're not
actually desktop computers it's actually
mobile and IOT devices so where does the
liability live for this we're going down
the rabbit hole now baby yeah
at what point in time can you say that
devices AOL and remote Prickett that's
exactly where I was going next and I
totally understand both perspectives
here on the one hand wow this is my
device I paid for it I own it it's mine
to do with as I please on the other hand
for the sake of the greater good
actually you really shouldn't be using
that anymore because you are a risk to
yourself and others maybe what they
would have to do is just not allow you
to connect to the net but then it
becomes a whole deeper conversation is
freedom versus nanny state and then
known over frankly no one's really wrong
in that case they're just right from
different perspectives for different
individuals that's interesting we should
stop all this oh boy that's gonna be
what would we strawpoll I don't even
know I I let's do it based on the phone
should a manufacturer be allowed to
brick and insecure phone is that the
question yeah okay but where I think
we're gonna have to add in win the date
after you receive isn't receiving the
footer but I would have to be when the
phone's launch do you know what let's do
it this way how
long should a manufacturer have to wait
and then one of them is indefinite yeah
okay okay I like it you're gonna have to
vote yeah I know that's why I'm like
that's why I just did the wall cuz I'm
thinking about it they have to calm yet
do they do they ever get that I don't
know no matter okay okay so I'm gonna go
with I'm gonna put in one year but I
think that's ridiculous I'm gonna put in
three because I think that's a pretty
typical security update timeline for
Android devices I'm gonna put five
because Apple has actually been pretty
consistent about supporting their
devices for four to five sometimes even
more okay another thing is is it brick
or is it brick the connecting to the
internet component let's say to remove
and insecure phone phones networking
capabilities okay yeah cuz if you want
to use it as like an iPod basically as
an I ever oh there's actually a lot of
functions phones can do without
connecting it's actually really annoying
the way Apple constantly harasses you to
put a sim in the iPhone I have one I
have an iPhone 6 that I just use as like
an mp3 player yeah and it's it's like
constantly no no I dunno I know there's
no 'cimmanon I I don't care and you
cannot tell it to not do that anyway so
when in chat said law states I'm not
necessarily sure what country they're
talking about but I think this is quite
common in a lot of countries law states
that a manufacturer manufactory should
support a product at least two years
after the consumer has bought it not
after the launch date so maybe consider
that we need an indefinitely as well I
don't know where you'd necessarily want
to put that but I'm gonna put it here I
think I think I've covered enough here
okay and we're specifically talking
about phones yeah that's another thing
to consider yeah we're we're narrowing
the scope of our question just two
phones and cutting off ability to access
the internet so you know what I'm gonna
do is I'm actually gonna pull floatplane
first so this way we can actually
see how our different audiences feel
about this I'm just kind of curious
right now so I'm I'm gonna vote but I'm
not gonna reveal my vote oh shoot I have
to do the reCAPTCHA interesting I'll try
to grab okay so we're gonna we've got
the results coming in from floatplane
floatplane is a freaking dialed in
audience because like there's a lot of
people watching over there but like not
that many but we've already got 130
folks oh wow it did not like that ' all
right so here it is we've got 48 percent
forty nine percent of the votes coming
in for five years we've got 17 percent
saying indefinite we've got 23 percent
saying ten years and ten percent of you
think it should be okay for a
manufacturer to brick the phone within
oh no less than 10 percent of you within
three years so three years or one year
almost no one that's ten no thanks 15
years because I think people either go
you know what 10 years is a nice round
number that's a very reasonable amount
of time if I had to buy six phones in my
adult lifetime that seems reasonable and
then anyone who thinks you should wait
longer than that it looks like is
straight-up indefinite yeah about half
of people apparently would be okay with
manufacturers breaking a phone after
five I find it amazing that indefinite
isn't just like wrecking the top me too
me too but I thought we were gonna get
skewered for you and I both kind of
leaning towards the like yeah maybe that
should be you know what most people
would be more forgiving than me I
actually said wait what did I say you
saw me click rate you said to me I say
10
I lost between 5 and 10 for a while and
then I eventually went with 10 and you
know what cuz and yeah I guess I had I
had like my s3 lasted for a long time
you know what I'm gonna throw this I'm
gonna throw this in the YouTube chat now
I'm tweet I don't even know I don't even
know where twitch chat is I'll get
twitch okay I had actually forgotten
about twitch I'm sorry twitch
sorry twitch um
so Wow yeah I really I really thought
that I thought that people were just
gonna be like yeah they should just
support things forever but it looks like
we've actually got some network security
minded people and that's probably the
math that's being done that go okay all
these things are developing so fast that
like ten years in network equipment
terms is like an eternity that's that's
why I picked on your web secured it's a
very very long time like that's forever
how many people how many people actually
use that what phone did you have 10
years ago how many of you are using a
router that is 10 years yeah like a
wrt54gl like how many of you are
actually still using that probably not
many my parents wrt 300 and just died
yeah and that was quite about that was
like four years later yeah yeah so so so
and then and I think it seems to me that
a lot of you we're actually doing the
math going well they're not providing
security updates for it anymore after
three to five so honestly I don't want
that on my network well you just think
what the phone you had 10 years ago like
what I had this I think it was from Sony
how do you remember is this white like
slide or fog now this is interesting the
broader YouTube population has now
started to weigh in and the five year
option is actually losing the some steam
yeah we've got more people saying
indefinite and we've got a lot more
people coming in and saying ten years
but I we had said ten years we did I
actually want to I want to take back my
vote I wanna I want to take back my vote
I want to say five years now like I said
I walked between the two if not like six
not ten yeah I think I've I've I think
five is a little bit too short for me
because like I said I had my s3 for I
think like four yeah like it was still
kind of fine but it probably wasn't
secure no now here's the thing I think
what some people aren't considering is
that excuse me is that
even if the manufacturer removes the
networking capabilities I think there
might be a middle ground here for us
like honestly something that I've really
felt that the Android in particular I
mean you're never gonna convince Apple
of something like this but that I've
really felt that the Android scene
should have is far better aftermarket
support for these mobile devices and I
don't expect every feature to work you
know I don't expect an old Samsung
Galaxy Note device to have all the
little special stylus functionality and
stuff like that but if we went okay in
terms of the manufacturers OS they can
turn off your networking capability but
if you can find a currently patched OS I
would like for our manufacturers to have
to also open that option up to you at
that time so if we created legislation
that basically said ok after five years
this thing is not your problem or six
let's say let's compromise a little bit
here after six years this thing is
straight up not your problem but you
have to unlock the bootloader you have
to allow third-party software to work on
it so people can restore basic
functionality or so that they can be not
not recycled recycling electronics is
actually like horrible compared to
reusing them so that they could be
repurposed in a developing country or
for your kids or whatever else in some
functional way as long as you're willing
to put the time in the effort into it
that I think is a reasonable compromise
that I'm totally done with especially
because five years ago maybe not even
five years ago like the early
smartphones like a Galaxy S vibrant or
an iPhone 3GS or something they are like
really bad bye
ten years later standards but I would
make the argument that something like a
Google Nexus 5 with a more basic OS on
it for sure like a lighter version of
Android on it but I would make the
argument that something like a nexus 5
would probably be quite usable by
comparison ten years after its launch so
this is a problem that honestly I think
we do need to solve and relatively soon
so this was the floatplane results ok
cool so we actually
most of the games that were most of the
losses in five years were made up in
indefinite actually and 10 10 years oh
wait oh sorry the order was reversed to
both of them yes yeah 10 10 years gained
but lost to indefinite indefinite gained
a ton yeah 10 years gained 4% though
that's not a still no one was interested
in 15 years
no on either side no fascinating that
blew my mind I did not expect those
results at all even the YouTube one I
don't remember how we got on this topic
um oh boy oh this is great you know I'll
be right back can you can you like just
cover the basic the basic news ness of
this yes I lost my perpetual dock some
house I'm gonna use Linus's red removes
mention of hydrogen one modules from
website which is really interesting
because we've never seen a company
promised that there would be additional
modules for a product and then not
deliver those modules ever before they
have always delivered those modules I'm
being and they have continued to invest
R&amp;amp;D in them for an extensive period of
time releasing tons of add-ons for a
product really yeah really adding a lot
of value really giving you those modules
that you were like this is why I'm
buying the product that that's what
everyone does who promises additional
things for but that happens every time a
hundred percent those companies that are
like yeah we're gonna make this things
can be the last one you ever need
because you can swap things out you can
upgrade it you can change it you can do
all kind of stuff but you just need to
buy the core thing every time it happens
no not at all no what are you looking
for it the hydrogen finally arrived like
two weeks ago I saw it there before the
move so I don't know if it's still there
or not
okay well sorry guys this is just the
least surprising news I had wanted to do
a live unboxing of my titanium
paperweight red hydrogen one titanium
Edition because they finally shipped
those and just in time for them to say
oh we made an oopsie this is really
making a first-gen product that like is
gonna sell a handful because here's the
thing I've worked in retail I know what
attach rates are like do you know what
an attach rate is I'm assuming when you
buy the extra things for something
that's right yeah so the attach rate is
the percentage of the people who come in
and buy one of these who also walk out
of the store with one of these for
example this one comes with the pen so
it's not really a great example but I
think you get my point
attach rates are pretty low especially
online so at retail stores like Best Buy
will train their sales reps all right
what do they call them the blue shirts
though they'll train their sales staff
to to really push attach rates hard
because a lot of the time that's where
the store makes their margins oh yeah
there is so much more margin in a you
know an Apple pencil then there is in an
iPad a controller versus a console I
guarantee it and this is Apple they make
plenty margin on their iPad too because
they're smaller there's less materials
there's less complexity and of course
they are still quite expensive because
they have a lot of value so they're
worth more even though they don't
actually cost more to make so attach
rates though are typically very low like
you're doing well if you're more than
low double digits in terms of attach
rate for a product now there are
exceptions to that things like the
Microsoft Surface pro my understanding
is that the attach rate for a keyboard
is extraordinarily high because the
thing is bloody useless without it
because it's windows on a tablet what
are you gonna do so people basically
just factor the price of one of these
keyboards into the surface pro buy they
bundle it as well okay question for for
you is a bundle still
an attach rate yeah it would be but it
depends on sort of how its positioned
okay so I would say that something like
an iPad bundled with a pencil is
increasing your attach rate whereas a
surface pro bundled with a keyboard is
like that should have just been included
in the first place
basically all you're really doing is
giving the consumer the option of which
keyboard they bless it with and not
having to create like an exponentially
larger number of SKUs in order to
support all the configurations would you
also differentiate between if it's and
this might throw off for a second but if
it's in the box or not what I mean by
that is when you buy like a console and
it comes with a game in the box no I
would call that's a product okay yeah
you only sold an Xbox because usually
you're not paying extra or you're not
paying a lot extra for that game and/or
it'll come with additional value so it's
hard to figure out what the consumer
assigned the value to for example there
was a Gears of War Xbox 1s that did come
with Gears of War but it also was read
and like looked cool and came with like
a red controller xbox controllers like
ever because the claw marks in it so
it's hard to decide if someone someone
might already own the game in fact if
there are big Gears of worm gears a worm
if there are big Gears of War nut they
they probably already pre-ordered the
game and or had an Xbox already like
think this is just yeah it's more like a
collector's item and less like an actual
Xbox one and game voice found that kind
of weird because they seem to sell
pretty well I guess
because they do them all the time I've
never seen one though and that's that's
the thing it's one of those weird ones
like an alienware desktop theoretically
yeah buying these but I've never seen
one at a LAN party yeah although to be
fair a lot of times LAN party pcs are
like a lot lower tier than you'd expect
and fair enough that was kind of
surprising to me too yeah me too but I
showed up with like all my water cooling
and stuff oh yeah oh I guess gamers and
computer enthusiasts don't necessarily
overlap not as much as I thought yeah
the amount of like like hacked out HP
computer that doesn't have any of the
panels anymore as like in 14 layers of
dust it's like such a high percentage of
land party feces yes and the number of
those people that are shocked that I'm
so bad at video games I'm saying this
street probably goes both ways all right
well I guess that's pretty much it for
one show because we have a stream
another stream to go set up yeah can you
play some pro for us yeah I mean we will
have lost our save no because I can just
save cool yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah bro
all right let's go bro so we'll see you
guys later bye
