is back and this time they're stepping
it up a little bit
classy style there we go so instead of a
backpack we get a briefcase and instead
of a piece of paper that I printed out
out of my email actually I have that too
I get this black envelope plus follow
the instructions shall we set up your
camera
we got a Brandon over there no problems
open the box the first thing you'll see
is a black envelope mine was on the
outside of the box that's okay
extreme rigged challenge 2017 the top
system builders in the world twelve of
them are competing to see which seven
are going to attend PAX East so you guys
are going to have to vote to see which
of them is going to be unveiling their
rigs in March so you can follow on
social media by using hashtag rig
challenge sweepstakes and you can enter
the sweepstakes over at rig challenge
intel.com
what exactly could you win while they're
giving away an HTC vive and you can vote
I believe once a day it is you'll find
the full terms in the video description
you can also win one of the amazing
rings so how let's have a look at what's
in ER
Oh first up is an all-access pass to
packed East
Clow includes airfare hotel and
conference so fun fact about these
all-access passes I tried to use one for
tax prime with the last until ring
challenge you have still have to go to
the ticket counter you don't just put
this on and try and walk through the
door don't let you in that was fun next
up we've got a t-shirt these are always
large why do they assume that nerds are
large I wear a medium that's okay I'll
give it to Luke and he'll be happy he
doesn't like paying for clothes anyway
and next up we've got some very
interesting stuff here a lot of very
safe protective foam and that's awkward
it's over here ah maybe I shouldn't have
thrown around this this doodad here
before we before we got started so we've
got a core i7 7700
okay this is intel's flagship named
stream processor so this puppy's clocked
at 4.2 gigahertz and she'll boost higher
than that with a fully unlock multiplier
for overclocking basically you put this
in any z2 70 board you throw a nice
cooler honor and it's pretty much off to
the races
it also has upgraded support for a wider
range of ddr4 dual channel frequencies
and pretty much all you need to know
about it it's about as fast as it gets
for gaming today this one's interesting
though this is one that I haven't seen
before this is intel's SSD 600 teeth so
intel finally has an m dot to nvme SSD
they were one of the first ones out the
door with PCI Express and you got two
SSDs targeted towards consumers and they
follow it up with MDOT too so they sent
over their one terabyte capacity one so
this will be a great upgrade for a
desktop or a notebook whatever it is
that you need to have a ton of wicked
fast storage inside and I'm actually
really looking forward to putting this
puppy through the paces in the next
little bit super tiny so it uses the N
dot to interface right there and the
nvme protocol over the indata interface
for reduced latency and improve
performance you can learn more about the
whole m dot two nvme AHCI quagmire right
over there and figure out how to know if
your system would be compatible with a
600 p but in the meantime the priority
is the extremely challenged so follow
hashtag rig challenge sweepstakes on
social media and head over to the link
in the video description to start voting
vote early vote often for a chance to
win an HTC vive or one of the rigs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
