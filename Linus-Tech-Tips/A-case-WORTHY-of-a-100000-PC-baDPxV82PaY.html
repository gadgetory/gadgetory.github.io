is gonna be a case unboxing it's gonna
be like exciting you're gonna be excited
look at this it's one case but it comes
in two gigantic not to mention very
heavy boxes he's like now I've seen that
before with the HAF stacker it was
terrible
yeah that was terrible but but but no
this time it's gonna be different this
is the case Labs thw 10 a massive
chassis for a project
get to that leader for a project that
I've had on the go for several months
now and attempt to take seven gamers one
CPU and make it productive six 8k video
editing stations running off of a single
motherboard and for that I needed a case
that was pretty unique so let's open it
up and make sure that everything
private Internet access VPN is fast
affordable and available now at the link
in the video description so step number
one here is figuring out how old the
dental to open this thing well that
explains why it didn't come off this is
like it's a it's a it's an odd sized
case so this is actually two case boxes
one put down on top of the other and
they don't fit all the way I can do this
I'm a professional and boxer Brandon
second person my ass wow this thing is
really big I guess while I open it up I
should explain so once it's finished
this system is going to have 228 core
CPUs which is why it needs such a large
motherboard tray so we're gonna be using
a SSI EB sized motherboard so that
doesn't fit in just your standard ATX
case then much of the rest of the case
is gonna be taken up by radiators
because the finished system is actually
going to have six high-end graphics
cards if I can get my way they're gonna
be quad rows which would put this system
somewhere in the neighborhood of 70 to
$100,000 but when you consider how much
a you know professional workstation with
a xeon cpu and a quadrille graphics card
costs in the first place 64 gigs of ram
and all that good stuff for six of them
in one tower it's not that far off is it
oh wow
from just looking at the one side panel
you clearly did not get a sense of the
full scope of this monster I'm a
professional and boxer Brandon so back
to why we need all that space so we've
got this giant motherboard we've got all
these graphics cards we need cooling so
there's gonna be I don't remember how
many but it's somewhere in the
neighborhood of like 8 radiators to make
sure that our dual CPUs and six graphics
cards will all be adequately cooled then
things get really interesting because
you can see back here we've got almost
as much space for Hardware behind the
motherboard tray so there's not going to
be really any graphics cards here or
anything as we do on the other side and
I have big plans for this so I've been
doing some experimenting with a really
unorthodox storage solution so have a
look at these these are you dot two two
PCI Express x 4 slot adapters so I was
concerned that because I was going to be
filling up all of my PCI Express slots
with graphics cards that I was gonna
have to get down to single slots somehow
I wasn't gonna have any way to put
sufficiently high speed storage in the
machine because these are professional
workstations I want every boot drive to
be super fast so what I wanted to do was
take the 4 u dot 2 slots here that's a
really unique feature of this board and
connect them to obtain memory drives
however the standard two and a half inch
u dot to form factor at the time I was
playing the project anyway didn't have
capacities that were high enough for me
to have enough space for 6 VMs to have a
decent sized boot drive so I figured
okay here's a solution we adapt them to
PCI Express slots
so my intention is actually to use a
bunch of the space back here to mount
these adapters from micro SATA cables
and somehow or other like call like that
or something I don't know so that I can
have full-sized PCI Express obtain
drives these 750 series are just here
for testing purposes then it gets even
more interesting
I haven't actually even done a test fit
for this yet but there's a company that
makes a PCI Express 16 X like it just
plugs into a slot 2 8 x slot adapter
using a bunch of PL x chips so what I
was kind of hoping when I saw that is
that I could put all of those over here
somehow somewhere and then every VM
could have its own USB card dedicated to
it so that it could have full
plug-and-play now that we've got the
skeleton open we can go ahead and peek
behind door number 2
so case labs cases are like quite
modular so you get all these like pieces
and you kind of screw them together
yourself that also allows them to have a
lot of different options so if you were
the kind of person who isn't living in
2018 and once you know a lot of five and
a quarter inch bays in the front or
whatever then you wouldn't go for these
like full sized or nearly full size
we've got one five and a quarter inch
bay up there on each side with grille
fronts this is all just mounting
hardware in case accessories holy crap
okay feeder on so let's start popping
some panels on this thing we've got the
dual ventilated top panel so all the
side panels which are tempered glass by
the way I have now checked I actually
don't know what I'm more excited for at
this point doing the finished build or
just getting my stuff off of this
horrible test bench for the rest of my
testing you know maybe you guys can let
me know for a build like this do you
prefer you know legit workstation
hardware just to look legit and
workstation or do you look at an
expensive machine that I mean let's face
it we are gonna game on it and see those
bare green Ram PCBs and go yeah
should we put heat spreaders over those
just get some aftermarket ones I want to
know so even though this motherboard
Dwarfs a normal board it still looks
tiny in here I don't think this system
is going to be movable by a single
person
it looks so lonely so that's pretty much
it let's take it upstairs okay be fine
gert I'll do that door opening plan
here we go no no make me move sorry not
meaning to be rude but just okay what
have I unused all right
Joanna grab an end I don't feel like
doing this on my own anymore okay ready
and one two three hopefully this thing
still works
wait I didn't plug in the SATA cable
that is going to power all the drives so
we're gonna shut this down but that's
okay that's the end of the unboxing of
the thw 10 hope you guys enjoyed it and
stay tuned because there are going to be
more updates on this project for sure
there's gonna be some crazy hardware
that we are using in it and speaking of
being crazy you'd have to be crazy not
to drive p.i a private Internet access
is the VPN that lets you do well all the
things that you would expect a VPN to be
able to do it keeps you more secure and
more private online and allows you to
get around pesky geo restrictions when
you are on the move or when you are at
home accessing services and tools that
you otherwise wouldn't be able to I've
been using it for quite some time now
myself and those feeds have been more
than satisfactory so go check it out at
the link in the video description thanks
for watching guys if you dislike this
video you can hit that button if you
liked it hit like get subscribed or
maybe consider checking out where to get
your very own thw 10 or maybe one of
their more reasonably sized options over
on case lapses website also in the video
description is our merch store which has
cool shirts like this one and our
