even live yet there we go
takes forever we should probably restart
this computer sometime this month or
century or I don't know but sometime
around there
welcome to the LAN show everyone Linus
is not here this week as you guys know
because he's away on a vacation where
he's cleaning his house the whole week
so that's super exciting we have some
really interesting news Google's stadia
we will probably talk about that 400 hi
I'm gonna go the opposite and be super
up right now Google stadia the future of
gaming yeah with that yeah let's talk
about what else we've got Samsung Galaxy
fold creases yes kind of brutal
increasingly obvious game Sora such a
big deal that steam is redesigning their
interface to not look like dinosaur
bones Wow Wow look the same since I was
born so roll the intro yeah my legs
caught me
oh I clenched hard enough
and it feels good to do a a nacho a nosh
it's been one ages
savage turkey suffix tricky and
methylene and okay how many sponsors so
what there we go ha yeah that one does
this work someone screwed with the
scenes a little bit that does work
though yeah I haven't been on the LAN
show since like when you were working at
your house more than here yeah that's
because you were you wouldn't be in oh
wait no I don't know I still do it on
Fridays well it's been a while so a flow
plane starts at like 8:00 a.m. which is
insane for me but I'm trying to make it
work so then Jaden the only guy who's
currently local like starting 8 a.m.
because then he's done work relatively
early is that good to me so on Fridays
when I have to do when show I usually
want to start a little later because I'm
after you when show anyways so then he
just stays at home so I just stayed home
but then I still have to start early
because we have weekly meetings on
Fridays and people are in different time
zones yeah so whatever it works out it's
fine but anyways should we just jump
right into stadia yeah because I think
this might like take a bit there's
elements to this there's yeah I'd be
heard of Google stadia guys it was
announced this week at the Game
Developers Conference it's uh it's a
streaming it's a game streaming platform
by Google it doesn't suck as much as the
ones of the past give it a chance hear
us out you might actually be awesome
although I have heard I don't know
enough about this ok and I think you're
gonna be notably more informed than I am
I hope not
but but I have heard that there's huge
input like compared to traditional
gaming not compared to other cloud
services but yeah a traditional game
well I read them the hands-on experience
that they had a digital foundry they
played with a beta one a few months ago
and they played with the new one this
week and they said well they give you
some numbers actually its source 3 in
the document because the table halfway
down and it looks like it's comparable
to console gaming ok
yeah and they were playing what there
playing was an assassin's Creed game and
they were playing at 1080p 30 frames a
second so had it been 60 frames a second
60 FPS then it could have actually had
lower latency than when you're playing
on the Xbox hmm but there's a bunch of
little caveats in the article you know
like they're using a Wi-Fi connection
that's probably bonkers they can't
account for the are using a Wi-Fi
connection it was they didn't have
control over where they got to play it
oh okay okay yeah there was that Google
own thing I think so it looks like
latency including display lag for Google
stadia well Google stadia latency seems
to be 166 regardless Google stadia on 15
megabit per second seems to be 188
milliseconds regardless that's supposed
to be like a worst case scenario one I
think according to Google I did say
there's asterisks on the latency not
including display lag for both of
googles the first asterisk says the
stadia tests were carried out at a
Google connection on a Google connection
versus our stream tests in the wild on a
200 megabit per second connection
however the stadia tests included
display latency on a pixel book which we
cannot measure and we're carried out via
Wi-Fi networking that's really weird
setup but I guess it's part of their
point of like you can do it anywhere on
any device yeah but it's just hard cuz
they only have one data point right now
there yeah I only got to play one game
in this one set up well I guess they
have two data points they got to play a
earlier version of the game before but
it wasn't on like the final kind of
ecosystem of like hardware stack so he's
saying this testing was done by digital
foundries yeah okay yeah cuz it's on
Eurogamer so I just wasn't sure but
digital foundries if they only have one
data point they're not going to be happy
with that so I'm sure we'll see more
coverage from them eventually it does
look as one would probably suspect the
input lag on PC especially above 30fps
is is much lower but there's a lot this
is how it's gonna start off exactly it's
like I'll get better it's a disruptive
technology in that in the formal sense
in like the actual definition of the
world
we're gamers today are like what's
possible with good gaming hardware is
way over serving what's necessary for a
lot of gamers and all stadia needs to do
is compete with that point it only needs
to be good enough for a lot of people it
doesn't have to be better than the top
at the top and eventually once people
start using and the technology matures
it it'll edge closer and closer until
it's just there's just no reason no
practical reason to to game the way that
we game today
one really interesting thing to me is
Google stay Diaz with display lag and
without display like is the same as Xbox
one X with display lag included which is
like you have to include display like so
whatever but that's gonna depend on what
display and it looks like that display
had a notable amount of like but still
you're getting extremely close if not
tied to next box 1x you know what they
said in their in their articles that the
the person reviewing it was very
familiar with the Xbox version of this
Assassin's Creed title and they didn't
have any like based on muscle memory
feeling of like oh this sucks
yeah it seemed really similar for them
so what did you read where the latency
was awful while I read 166 I I'm a snob
games at high fresh rates and yeah ok to
me on PC with a ridiculous computer and
a ridiculous monitor I'm like that is
far too slow for me right but looking at
these numbers especially if you're
coming from console that actually sounds
pretty damn good mm-hmm there's so many
aspects of this that are so different
and cool that I'm I'm excited about I
think it's pretty wild because I I have
always hated the idea of like powerful
GPUs and laptops I've basically always
hated that as like something that I
would purchase on my own why because you
think it's just like totally negates the
whole reason to have a laptop pretty
much just like wow why not just carry
around this 25 pound freaking brick with
a goo external power supplies it's a
million pounds they're usually way too
thick they get wicked hot they're just
kind of written aloud and then the
external docks came out and I was like
that's a really cool solution I like
that but it's
a little clunky and it never well it's
not really portable then yeah I'm
talking about a GPU enclosure yeah
that's good for I don't know it's good
for having a desktop where you come in
hey now I'm at home nice we should at
least like reduce some devices and still
have a gaming machine and like whatever
else there's like kind of a cool option
but it didn't solve all the problems and
they're really expensive they're really
expensive it doesn't solve the
portability problem there's still some
other issues with this you could game on
your phone you have a pixel book like
they said Android devices a kid it
enables a lot of different options which
is super cool I'm still I I have like my
own opinion problem things with this
from a technical standpoint I think it's
freaking fantastic super cool I'm really
interested II where it goes from that
aspect I don't even like the idea of
purely digital games with our current
set up oh man there's so many angles to
cover here so like the idea of removing
that much more from you is a looming for
like an ownership perspective yeah
because like I've always hated the idea
of like origin has a thing now I don't
remember what it's called but you pay
for like a year at a time and you get
access to basically all games on Origin
all of these games until you don't read
up so you don't read out here in the top
and you lose all of them and that just
seems completely insane to me I don't
know
it's like subscribing versus buying it's
renting really you're leasing internet
access yeah you think this is a
generational opinion well you think kids
who grow up in this subscription model
world or they don't care and you've got
like an old school thing I think they
might be more used to it
because we're gonna get real deep right
here real quick but tell me about your
mother
[Laughter]
no I our generation and below is having
an extremely hard time owning anything
mm-hmm
whether there's things in place stopping
us time or real estate now over real
estate cars almost anything it has
become way more difficult for our
generation to own things and things have
come in to help us deal with not owning
things yeah and if you just have to pay
for a subscription that one time per
year
it's probably be a lot easier - it's
really interesting how all these
different dimensions converge you've got
you've got the economic realities of
yeah being a millennial or Gen Z yeah
you've got the new business models that
totally enable ya you've about the
consumer culture the sense of
entitlement the the convenience culture
of wine things right now and they all
kind of just work together to make this
perfect storm of what we've what where
we're headed that's it gets way freakin
deeper yeah but that's but that's it's
like it's not just Google stadia that's
the problem is like now we're talking
about like the human condition of now of
gaming stream like there's a really cool
that enables you to do stuff like I love
the idea that I could play save on my
phone and yeah and that's wicked and you
can play Civ on a switch but it's not
the full game something able to place it
on my phone it's pretty sick it might in
this might legitimately enable a wider
range of design on how many games is
that's gonna be up to the developers to
decide how or you know allow you to play
it all these difference yeah so there
could is it true that there could be a
game on stadia where I can only play
this on my laptop or TV I can't pick
this up on my phone or is it gonna be a
requirement that they have to be on all
of them I have no clue personally I
wouldn't be surprised if developers were
able to restrict you to some degree
because they don't want people to have a
worldly negative experiences yeah
because you try to play like a highly
complicated game that requires a huge
amount of variable inputs and like can't
be done on console because you need a
keyboard and why would a want late on
your phone why would Google wanna bake
mmm yeah your game doesn't fit our mold
so you can't be on our store they want
to build up their library especially
since isn't it like um a Linux kernel
like games have to be kind of built or
supported especially to it right yeah
but I'm sure people are gonna want to be
on Google stadia and will make their
things work what do you think about the
the fact that it's 10.7 teraflops or
something like that it's I guess they're
their hardware stack which is powered by
AMD is as powerful as a ps4 pro and an
xbox 1x combined does that mean much and
it
when you're game streaming well yeah
because you're not gonna want it does
mean a lot because even on consoles
right now you have dips which like why
can't remember the name of them right
now they're the people who ran the tests
for this digital foundry digital foundry
has done tons of different tests on like
graphical dips in different console
games and PC games and whatever just
hitching when a new region there's
actually super interesting digital
foundry channels fantastic you should
check them out on YouTube we've been
saying them a lot so you might as well
give him a shout out I didn't know that
a YouTube channel yeah I only heard
their print stuff this dude he hosts it
yeah let's see one second so because I
would think that the bottleneck really
is going to be your internet connection
because it you know it's capable of 4k
60 but then if you only have I think 25
megabits a second then you're gonna be
down to 1080 probably and if you only
have like 15 megabits a second then
you're getting a scale down further to
720 I like 30fps there you go digital
foundry YouTube channel oh yeah they do
some really cheap unsurprising google
stadia specs plus analysis specs
analysis and exclusive performance
testing I haven't watch this yet I
should I will sounds good yeah that'll
be cool but yeah they do they do tons of
really cool stuff different dives into
performance of different consoles
different games etc etc but I thought
that's a cool name digital foundry yeah
it's pretty cool I like it
yeah but they they I think it's gonna be
important so that people can't criticize
it as much well it's it's a new very
different emergent technology type of
thing so a lot of people that are gonna
come out of the woodwork like me and try
it and try to look for any possible
thing that they can go after to tear it
down because it sounds fantabuloso we're
trying to find any negative thing about
it so if they can just crush the
performance and make it so you're
getting whatever frames they decide
you're getting for that game at this
latency all the time and it's going to
be good all the time and even crazy
things happening the game isn't going to
worsen your experience
I think the communication around it will
be really good I don't in some ways the
optics and the negativity around it from
existing gamers doesn't matter a whole
lot because again it's generational
where there's probably I don't know the
numbers but I would guess that there's
probably more people watching games than
playing games there's probably more
people watching twitch streams around
the world than gaming in general and I
would think that this technology is
gonna have so it's gonna create a whole
new wave of gamers gamer gaming will be
bigger than ever if you are like I could
I could imagine walking into my living
room if I have Google stadia and my
wife's playing video games it's like
it's just so much more accessible and I
don't need all this hardware it'll be so
much cheaper well ok here's here's
another weird angle at it talking about
different generations and stuff like
that if we move out of North America
yeah the emerging markets there's the
whole crew deep iversity serious things
India is coming online and incredibly
faster rate than before if the devices
that they have are a phone or a fairly
low-end computer or something like that
because they're just coming online for
like the first time this if they can
afford it and maybe a little different
pricing region or something I don't know
it's probably a way easier way to get
into gaming for sure buying a gaming rig
or buying a console and for at least
simplicity you don't have to buy all
that stuff you don't have to know about
what you need to buy especially in PC no
one knows what what do I need to buy how
much do I need to spend to play this
game consoles make that a lot easier but
it's still an upfront investment which
is reason number 2 you need to have five
hundred dollars at a time with this you
could I don't they haven't done any
pricing announcements at all but I
assume it's gonna be something similar
to either like a Netflix model where
you're just a subscription or they could
do it like they do with the google
movies where you know I'm gonna pay $7
this month we're gonna pay $7 to rent
this game for two days or something and
just with that little amount of money
you can play and you don't even need to
use their controller and then the next
reason there's another one it will come
back to me mm-hm
get an older here while you're thinking
about that I do think some people are an
inch out of bringing this up saying
more people play this game at one time
than are all of on twitch I think I
think he's saying there are more people
that have watched games basically
there's just a whole ton of people that
watch games and don't necessarily game
it's not an insignificant amount of
people and there's a lot of people even
that I know that watches significant
amount of games and play a small amount
of games that doesn't mean there isn't a
huge base of people that has played
games all the time even forgetting that
comparison what I'm saying is I think
that there are a lot more people in the
world who could be gaming that are yeah
and this will get the minute oh yeah the
next reason was accessibility they have
integrated this with YouTube so when
you're playing you whenever you're
playing a stream that's 4k 60 gets
created you can hit this button on the
dedicated controller if you happen to
use it but you don't have to that yeah
you can use any current controller
keyboard mouse whatever setup you want
unless you're playing on the chromecast
in which case you need to have their
controller okay anyway it's got a
capture button on us you can start a
stream you can start streaming and when
you when you're on YouTube and you're
watching someone's stream there would be
or even if you're just watching a
trailer for a game on YouTube though
it's going to be a button that says play
you can tap that button on your Android
device or whatever and apparently within
as little as 5 seconds you could be
playing the game
damn that is crazy if you're just on
your computer you're on your MacBook
you've never played a game in your life
and you're like hey what's this button
do and then suddenly you're just gaming
on a Mac that's crazy
you're watching this trailer you're like
this looks amazing you press play and
you're like it looks like junk log in
synapse crap but it's it's a pretty cool
premise another thing you can do is just
what's the actual name of this feature
they've got crowd share I think yeah
it's something like god they have
something where you can crowd play so
you can be watching a creator or a gamer
streaming and you can actually say oh I
want to join their game and join and
join the queue if there's a queue or if
you're watching a nobody you can just
jump in and game with them that move hey
I'm one of those nobody do you stream no
okay but I have a youtube channel that
has no
anything's okay on my first dream if
anyone happens to watch goes on and play
with James they can write that's so cool
nice they have another thing called us I
would have been streaming for a while
would not want that feature they have
all sorts of tools up here people
probably turn out yeah we have another
thing called state share which is yeah
you can just save your state in the game
like I'm right here with with these
items you can send a link and so someone
just click that link and then the game
loads up and they're like right where
you are and you try to beat my time or
can you beat this can you pass this this
puzzle and that's super cool that is
actually pretty cool a lot of people are
bringing up as well that like Oh
Internet's can be a big problem I think
in a lot of areas it will be in a lot of
areas of wampie the internet it's a big
problem thing I would assume is going to
mostly come from people who reside in
the United States of America because we
all have horrible internet I've had a
better time getting internet in Canada
which is that's crazy bigger this is
crazy talk and has way less people than
a lot of people that I know in the
States
really it's wild there are places in the
scenario that's fantastic yeah yeah yeah
there's amazing places in the States for
Internet there's also tons and tons and
tons of terrible places in the States
Australia is horrible there are places
that are really bad but there are also
places that are absolutely fantastic
hopefully things like data caps will
eventually disappear because they're
just exploitive as far as I can tell
that's pretty much it and hopefully
internet connections in general will get
better if you want to look at how
ridiculous internet is in the States
I don't remember all the details I don't
know what it's called but at one point
in time the US government gave a whole
whack ton of money to ISPs to set up a
fiber backbone and then they just didn't
pretty wonderful kind of funny how that
worked out but yeah this it's in some
places it's great in some places is
terrible stadia will probably be a
little bit better in the places that it
is good but if over quickly it's 25
megabits per second right for a minimum
yeah I think you can go lower
okay I think you can go to 15 and have
seven twenty fifteen to twenty five
million but for a second though I think
what if it if people can get that I'm
starting to think about just small
businesses and emerging markets like if
you go to Philippines or something like
that are Thailand there's internet cafes
CC bombing exactly there's internet
cafes with desktop computers well with
this they either won't have to provide
any machines or they'll just provide
basic like Chromebooks and as long as
they have good internet it makes you
gotta be bossed of hosting that place a
lot a lot lower you just need a bunch of
Ethernet cable sticking out yeah it's
kind of cool let's see like let's go to
Shaw what is Shaw's like basic plan I
don't know I'd like to know actually
lately I've been thinking I should get
gigabit maybe I don't think they have
are you've got to go to like no Varys or
something called no I just want to see
I'm going for like with if your mom and
dad don't care about the internet yeah
and you like to play stadia is that
called Lightspeed really internet 7575
is like as low as you can go on Shaw Wow
man I think people are gonna be okay
it's still 50 bucks though 65 bucks a
month kind of nuts man I remember used
to be 30 now it's like 120 heard the
good stuff Wow hey what about the
control have you seen the controller I
have the interested in that Hayden what
do you think absolutely hate it the look
you mean I will hate using it how do you
know so I hate PlayStation controllers I
wish they would have put the thumb stick
up by the right why is my only problem I
agreed stop I don't know why they did
that maybe it would look too much like
an Xbox controller
I have fairly large hands and I have no
idea how people with fairly large hands
place their hands on PlayStation
controllers properly because with an
Xbox controller I can like offset both
hands a little bit and it works okay I
don't like controllers in general I'd
liked the Duke controller really hates
cuz it's way too big
everyone in my family my dad with my
brother
and me all love to do really but the
buttons are pretty close together on
duke like they're not spaced like that
like those ones that's fair but I liked
how you grip it yeah and where the thumb
stick this is good information free cuz
I think we're gonna do a video on the
Duke nice yeah anymore
they made a new one though you can get
find one really yeah there's a new Duke
controller new that was awesome yeah I
think they made it as like a semi joke
semi like you can buy it to remember the
past kind of okay I don't think it was a
huge problem yeah because we made that
video like was Windows Vista really that
bad and we're thinking about doing other
things like that
like was the Duke never really that bad
I don't think I think the Duke
controller was a bad idea because I
think they were what they ended up
aiming for whether they meant to or not
was a very small group of people so like
bad show the new export like Xbox 360
controllers are great the best I love
accessories okay this looks kind of
Mickey Mouse especially look at the
d-pad it looks kind of Maj it does but
in this article he said it felt very
Xbox II says it feels good Google makes
okay hardware are you using it yeah yeah
I'm not that worried about how okay I'm
a little bit worried because controllers
are actually relatively hard but yeah
knowing Google I'm going to assume
they're their material stuff will be
pretty good and I'm assuming their thumb
sticks and their buttons in their d-pad
and whatnot will all be pretty good
mm-hmm
I don't suspect they're gonna be the
best I don't think they're going to be
terrible though if people have been
watching channel for a long time they've
seen me pitch a controller to Linus
while he hits it with a bat we've had
some pretty negative experiences with
controllers I don't expect we'll have
that here the one thing I'm going to
hate is those damn thumb sticks yeah me
too I've always been into the staggered
thumbs just to me it seems objectively
more ergonomic like your hand wants to
be like this it doesn't want to be like
that I have I have seen people where it
looks like it worked really well for
them for me I just look like a crazy
alien trying to hold the damn place good
lord what do you think about this other
special button we haven't talked about
the Google assistant button apparently
when you're like stuck at a part in a
game you can hold it down and be like I
need help and
we don't know what it does but it says
of the Nintendo insider program whatever
that was called or you could call in
yeah like we're going back to the like
late eight if I have to guess I think it
looks at like at times some sort of
metadata timestamp of where you are in
the game and we'll bring up other
people's streams or their at the same
spot and then so you can just watch that
and they can they they would be able to
tell because their progression data
would go forward so they would know that
they'd be better yeah yeah and it's just
it's integrated with YouTube again and
the assistance interesting they'd have
to find interesting it would be so funny
if the most viewed clip at that part of
the game was some kind of troll the
hilarious part Jenkins kind of clearly
asked for help and that you get Leroy
Jenkins it god damn it that's hilarious
or like how do you censor oh because
like there's there's the game that you
could be playing which might be M rated
or something okay so you have to be
whatever HR ready but what if you like
are playing that game but you really
don't like it swear words or you really
don't like oh yeah okay conversations
about a specific topic and that streamer
happens to be saying something at that
time and it brings you to that stream so
what they're gonna have to find like oh
wow non for mature audience streamers
maybe they'll just use the thumbs up and
down or you can report that and they
won't use anything I got flagged yeah I
just
with what YouTube's algorithm has been
doing for the last while in terms of
players people and stuff I don't know
how much I trust that but that's
interesting though is that I think it's
kind of it would be even cooler if they
tracked how many times you used it in
the game why just so that you have that
like if you get a I could but oh like a
completion angle am I kind of a loser
you definitely are right it's like but
it's hitting right there like been stuck
on this boss for 45 min you could just
press the button and it's just like god
I think of it yeah I don't know I think
you getting achievement unlocked for
like beating it with no button no said
you didn't use this tech that we made
good job I don't expect they'd do it but
I think
we cool you just hold it down this order
pizza while you're playing so what
there's a next I assume it has the power
of the assistant like full on right yeah
yeah yeah so there's there's stadia
home-button I'm assuming in the middle
yeah because there is a there is a UI
that you can use rather than using voice
so maybe that's what does that it
probably turns on the controller as well
well and I'm assuming that brings you to
like game selection and whatever else
well what are these other two buttons on
the top then so I'm thinking stadia home
screenshot
that's the capture button yeah capture
screenshot whatever our stars screaming
screaming or yeah okay yeah Multimedia
of some thing oh wait is it just
streaming for sure I kind of funky to
have a start stream button on your
controller I
I would assume that it's a option either
oh okay then Google help I'm assuming
settings and like dot dot and then the
hamburger menu thing yeah which I'm
assuming are just developer programmable
buttons essentially start and select
yeah yeah yes so and then how many
shoulder buttons do you think it has
that I think there are other images you
think a Google image it like we I know
I've seen other angles so we might be
able to see if it has just two bumpers
or if it's got triggers to I just want
to control it let me just come up I
think I'll be fine but you never know
side looks like - yeah you can tell on
that yeah sweet
it looks more the paddles look more Xbox
II from that it's a big flick on the
bottom of the trigger you see I like to
like underneath your hand to hold under
your you know like yeah yeah yeah this
is the controller that's my finger
yeah and it's got Wi-Fi built-in hey so
when you're doing with chromecast the
controller itself is what's connecting
to the Google servers so I guess that's
the lowest latency way to do it I want
to I want to pull the audience here
really quick because I that the non
offset thumbsticks drives me absolutely
you want to say who is on your team but
I'm wondering if they made the right
decision
maybe fanboys better get in here
assemblé what would you call the
PlayStation style or should I just do
Xbox style versus PlayStation style
awesome but I don't want my fan ball
mine aligned okay
plain are I felt like putting KB mod in
there but I don't want to screw the poll
too much hmm I wonder though cuz even on
the the switch pro controller the
buttons kind of suck like to your point
about controllers being hard floors are
hard they're hard they're really hard
like the the lab at Microsoft but I
don't remember exactly what it's called
where they like bring in tons of people
take 360 degree photos of them take
exact scans of their hands have them try
controllers do like extensive organ ama
casting on controlling stuff like
Microsoft is crazy both that tour you
did when you saw like their hardware
surface yeah stuff it's wild they have a
whole fairly sizable and very
well-funded team as far as I can tell
team dedicated to just the ergonomics of
different things that they make yeah
they still make mistakes sometimes Wow
and like those those guys are crazy as
far as I can tell
well sorry YouTube I don't have you guys
open on on this screen so I can't share
the strawpoll thank to you hopefully
someone watching will go over and post
it on post on YouTube yeah just comes
out 50/50 we need those YouTube votes we
do it's strawpoll dot any / 1 7 6 6 0 7
0 1 there you go Wow let's see what the
current results are
I wonder well it's button with the
stream what do you think they're gonna
price that controller at result wow it
is pretty close
what offset is winning yes he's 5 Oh
what if that's a PC thing it's very
close though he's legitimately and votes
are pouring in but its moe
staying at where it's at well they just
stopped me we're pouring it I need a
refresh Wow
I mean you want to make it not a fanboy
thing but I'm pretty sure it's a fanboy
thing probably like if you raise
Playstation that's what you're gonna
like although mind you I had a ps1
including the DualShock with those thumb
stick a few years then I had Xbox from
then on so I did experience both but I
loved the Xbox design as soon as they
came in with the controller ass yeah the
Duke No
when I got my xbox that ass was already
out okay it was that Christmas yeah so I
almost all my experiences was Nintendo
except my cousin's had a Playstation so
all my like adult console playing not
that I think Nintendo isn't but I think
you know what I mean
was on a Playstation and then we got our
own Xbox and was immediately like holy
crap this controllers way better it was
it was an immediate thing it wasn't like
oh I'm more used to this one now it was
like I knew the whole time I was Asian I
didn't like that controller and when I
pick up a PlayStation 1 now I'm like
yeah yes exactly
yeah yeah but maybe the PlayStation
people feel like that when they pick up
a off set maybe yeah it is quite close I
am surprised
this is this is X T 4 T now this is kind
of it's still pretty close all right
this is kind of what I expected was
offset was going to win but not by a ton
and I I wonder like did Google even
bother trying to check this out or maybe
they got different results from us maybe
it's a problem because we are a more PC
focused community well I think it's a
problem because we're probably a more
Western community right now especially
due to the time slot of the LAN show
maybe this will change after the vaad
goes up and people in different times
don't see it wise like when the Japan
comes online hahaha right but why they
will probably change a little bit but
why did they come to that conclusion
that it's just so weird I don't know we
should probably do some some spots here
right that makes sense we have to talk
about something that isn't stadia for
some amount of time on the show bump
savage jerky Moho
they're jerky is made with the best
ingredients without nitrates or
preservatives with the goal to create a
snack that it's full of flavor and spice
it isn't bad for you and it's handmade
pretty cool one of their flavors that
they're trying to promote right now is
momo premium jerky it is my second
favorite flavor
what does Maho mean garlic lime and
cilantro yeah pretty much
oh hell yeah oh that it's it's a very
like kind of fresh citrusy kind of I
don't know are you a cilantro guy yes
little why are you it you're not no I am
I am but you should acknowledge its
population and I wonder if they would
object to this my my actual favorite
flavor is very heavily related its Moho
jalapeno is that just hot version of
this or is it kind of a different flavor
profile I actually don't know the exact
ingredients involved but I think it's
pretty similar plus jalapenos but yeah
if you're not into that they have tons
of other great flavors as well
so oh and also cumin apparently in that
one Oh in here yeah right now if you buy
any three bags of Moho jerky I think
there's a few different kinds they'll
throw in another bag of Momo for free
check it out an LMG calm slash savage
Moho what which is not the lower third
we have right now at all savage but
ignore this down here and go to LNG calm
slash savage Moho Moho spouts mojo101
Audrina
wait but it's not boats bTW okay
McGuinness madrenas coffee oh he's good
you just wish I knew why do I want one
Madrid
you could I have many different phrases
now oh I don't want to derail this but I
haven't have to take them out - that
makes sense
yeah yeah madrenas coffee is coffee for
fuel organic cold brew coffee and
convenient 15 ounce cans with the flavor
for everyone madrenas coffee offers
sweet and creamy flavors like mocha
caramel or both flavors like their cold
brew black we have a permanent item on
their East or the lambo roast right here
check it out it's Linus tech tips
inspired coffee there's also if you
don't love us as much which is like I'm
heavily offended now but they have other
influence or related ones as well I
think they have like an insane one
that's for shroud oh yeah and I think
they've got some other ones too but you
should get the Lambo I thought you're
gonna talk about the roast Oh a roast
that's also coming if you hate us watch
the road is where we all make fun of
each other very savagely you know I'll
say this before the thing there's a lot
of really really really easy things to
make fun of Linus for there's not a ton
of more complicated ones and most the
really easy things are like kind of
lowbrow well that that gets to the
question of how Savage do you want to be
that's fair you know you want to talk
about like business acumen or like yeah
how you raise your kids if you make fun
of his sandals everyone can walk away
happy yeah
yeah but that's handles are pretty funny

really easy to pick up anyways head over

started business I was like just do that
what am I we're not even on the sponsors
for anymore
one of my favorite things about having
Squarespace as a sponsor has been almost
any time one of my like random
acquaintances is like hey web site for
me I'm like no you can use this thing
though it's actually totally cool
totally cool when I was like 18 our
merch our merch boom our merch store
it's starting to pop off there's new
designs coming all the time
yeah this is semi new there's some
really new stuff that's so new we
couldn't show it right now yeah but keep
looking at that merch store and oh the
tech link shirts
yeah heckling shirts sweet really cool
I'm into just a smaller yes little logo
there and a nice shirt and that's
exactly what they are nice and so it's
just how state did you want this is this
is really awesome but quite stated and a
little logo in the corner is a little
bit more so you know what yeah and
that's what's coming soon us just like
ltte logo heck yeah it's pretty sweet
there you go you know what is what
stands out about these I never never saw
and like let me put it this way I came
home and my wife was wearing this to bed
I was like what are you doing they're
soft
yes get out of here yeah she's pregnant
she's stretching it out take that off
but it says a lot it says a lot bitch
once she's wearing this stuff now it
doesn't even matter what's on it it's
just a good shirt on its own merits
that's one of the reasons why so the
store is kind of our own store and
there's been a huge amount of wool
- media groups on store and there's been
a huge amount of effort within the team
to make sure the shirts are good so make
sure the prints on the shirts are
actually good quality I got a shirt from
a company that I'm not gonna name
because I like them
but I got it at a show and after one
wash the whole thing looked like it was
actually dying like the whole logo was
disintegrating
that sucks that won't happen to these
which is great let's do that and our
shipping to Europe very recently got way
cheaper yeah we actually saw a spike I
think yeah happen yes cool so just a
heads up on that one because it is a new
kind of operation that the guys are
working on shipping to certain areas has
been a little rough but over time as
we're shipping more and more stuff
getting better deals Wales and Europe
went from like pretty brutal to actually
quite cheap oh nice yeah exactly
sweet action yeah what do you want now
five minutes on this one sure let's do
it so it turns out competition is good
and steam is like oh crap epic game
store exists so epic game store has an
exclusive called Metro Exodus yeah it
sold two and a half times more copies on
the epic game store than a comparable
game Metro last light sold in the same
amount of time on Steam two and a half
times more and what this proves
according to one of the epic epic guys
he said it's really about your game not
so much about your the store you sell it
on and that I think that's true like our
people loyal to steam or do they just go
wherever the game is I don't there's a
lot of fan loyalty I'm gonna absolutely
counter this a little bit someone to
play devil's advocate to just drive the
conversation forward somewhat because I
think that is a super BS statement to a
certain degree I think a lot of it is
definitely about your game look at apex
legends there was no marketing around
that before it came out and it blew up
immediately it can be definitely about
your game but a lot of the driving
around that is there was no traditional
marketing for apex legends what there
was was huge million dollar deals to get
streamers to play it on day of launch
okay
ninja got a million dollars for one
stream as far as I know drought and a
whole bunch of other streamers were also
paid to play it on launch there was a
lot of new-age marketing for Apex there
was actually a ton of marketing it was
just right away on launch
instead of crappy trailers from way
before and it was a good game and it was
a really good game so when they played
it they're like this is sick yeah
so marketing and the game matters both
of those things matters I think a huge
amount of marketing for Metro Exodus
like way more than probably any version
of Metro has ever had in the past was
everyone complaining about the fact that
is on the epic game store the the fact
that Metro Exodus was an exclusive on
the epic game store going hey everyone
there's this cool game that we're
showing you in this article that's on
the epic game store buy it here was
probably a big freaking help I it's it
was on the top of Reddit as far as I
know it was all over the place oh my
goodness Metro Exodus is going to be an
epic game store exclusive let me ask you
this you bought the collector's edition
there's a sticker on the back that
covers the steam logo and puts the epic
game store logo that tops read it again
like there was huge talk about it sorry
you go let me ask you this
aside from this particular example do
you personally feel like you have
loyalty to any game store or
distribution platform or is content is
king I prefer content is king for me for
sure it's about the game it's a sliding
scale probably well yes but I would
prefer to buy something on Steam because
I find notable annoyances in the other
platforms okay like there's there's a
number of notable annoyances with origin
design things that I don't like about
the platform and I mean yeah as well
sure I will grant that if there's if
it's if a game is available on all
all-district all platforms it's not
usually the case but if it is you know
then you're gonna have your favorite
right and maybe its usability or where
your friends list is or something like
that that's probably a big part of it
but more and more people using discord
and other like agnostic things yeah but
my biggest thing is the game for sure to
give an example the tie-in with what you
were just talking about is Hades a game
from supergiant games I'm a massive
supergiant games fanboy bastions one of
my favorite games ever hades came out on
the epic game store only i bought it
immediately and had to download and
install the epic game store to play it i
just did it because they're one of my
favorite game developers i'm sure i love
this game i did love the game it's not a
lot of friction there no here's another
thing that might sway where you bite get
your game from on the epic game store
the developers only have to pay out
12% - that's how much the epic game
store is gonna take they're gonna take
12 percent of the revenue on Steam
they're taking 30 percent for the first
10 million dollars in sales after that
Valve's going to take 25 percent then
further down to just 20 percent after 50
million sales 20 percent is still a lot
more than 12 percent and 50 million
dollars in sales is a lot so you know
you the developers getting more so if
you care about that you might go to a
game store
there's also some other stuff like this
which I definitely don't know enough
about but is epic game store user data
accessible by the Chinese government
oh if I remember correctly I could be
super off here because I didn't know we
were gonna go this angle on the stream
so don't believe what I'm saying and
look into it on your own I think 10 cent
has a pretty big ownership of Epic Games
oh yeah well that's a problem is that is
that right or is that super off I'm
really not sure or maybe well they
definitely own fortnight here's why
you're looking that up here's another
thing that's kind of cool while Metro
Exodus runs the developer zone for a
engine were it were that game powered by
epics Unreal Engine 4 the engine
licensing fees would have come out of
epics 12% cut instead of being added on
top of steams 30% cut so that is a huge
incentive for developers to go on that
platform and use that that that's just a
dual incentive I think that's so cool
use our platform for distribution and
use our engine and then you're gonna
save you're gonna have so much more
revenue yeah that's cool that is that's
a really good angle for them the 10 10
cent thing that I just called it was
true apparently 10 cent owns 40% of Epic
Games what does that mean for the law
though and well it you know that law
that I'm talking about
we're like that company like Chinese
corporations have to yeah yeah I mean
you go to the government in there that
stuff so like do they have to be a 51%
owner in order for that law to apply I
don't know I don't know I have no idea
it's it's a very it's
a but but it muddies the water for a lot
of people anytime big China is involved
you know things get a little bit murky
and we're depending on how people are
gonna want to deal with things but then
you're probably talking your friends on
discord anyways so so okay anyway part
of this article is that the steam store
is being redesigned to look more modern
what do you think about that often
people don't like redesigns the one
thing that threw me off a little bit is
in the dock at least it's so
specifically steam the library
redesigned mm-hmm
the steam store I couldn't give a care
if the steam store changes I don't
necessarily want huge changes to the
steam library just because right now
it's extremely efficient there's the
search bars right there you search a lot
of really fancy interfaces are not easy
to use they become less efficient more
clicks are involved or just like there's
no clear hierarchy of things there's
just big flashy tiles and you're like
like I was playing project cars to it
it's just like settings is here and
quick plays and they're all just like
look super slick but if you're lost
whereas the traditional like file system
yeah look yeah and steam uses that for
your library the default view is just
like tiny text names for each game with
no fancy indicators at all I think as
young people because the epic game store
is gonna have a lot of its users coming
there because of fortnight fortnight I
would assume is a pretty young user base
if this is the next generation of gamers
and if they if there is any kind of
loyalty to the platform then these are
you don't get them while they're young
on the epic game store if steam or valve
wants to attract those users to their
platform they're gonna have to have a
platform that isn't icky when you first
log in that is like whoa this is too too
information dense to inaccessible I'm
out of here
I'm going back to epic yeah yeah I I
think that would be so 53% of four-night
gamers are ten to twenty ten to twenty
five yeah half of them if they're a
younger what else you got no what yeah
younger than ten no four percent of
memory in strollers
okay so yeah I don't know it's just it's
it's an interesting kind of idea but I
could definitely see that being a thing
I just my only thing is when they
redesign chat I don't really think you
got much better I think I think chat
went from like what would I even say
here like a 2002 design to like 2000 and
late 2000 and yeah exactly like it
didn't even get into the tenseness they
went they worked for like 2002 to 2009
2009 but like it's 29 team now so you
redesigned your chat and it doesn't look
new so are they gonna redesign their
library and it's just gonna potentially
be less efficient potentially and still
not look that fancy a new time will tell
yeah we'll see I just steam it I don't
personally have a lot of confidence in
steam redesigning things graphically
because it's never been an attractive
platform in my opinion should we look at
some super chats yeah let's do it
maybe that changes maybe that all
changes maybe that changes maybe they do
a great job I don't know I think we
probably could know right now I think
there's details even in the land aw here
my reading that I'm reading super chats
Luke do you also dislike services like
Netflix I don't have a Netflix
subscription raise I'm a weird person
you're old hat I'm very old but I think
one of my things one of my reasons for
doing that is like one of the things I'm
a super fan boy out of his Star Wars
specifically within the Star Wars
universe I am a super fanboy of the
Clone Wars animated series mm-hmm I
bought the Clone Wars animated series on
blu-ray and then Disney was like hey
we're gonna have our own streaming
platform and we're ripping all of our
stuff off of your platforms so now my
Netflix description is not gonna have
Star Wars on it anymore but I still have
it so that's that's my thing is like
very good I don't even watch shows that
often that's another thing so like the
ones I care about I have yeah I don't
have to worry about some New Deal or
something coming in with different
platforms and oh they're raising their
rates or whatever I don't care I already
own the things and that happens every
month every month there's content that
leaves the Canadian Netflix and I don't
have to worry about it alright hit me
hit me other no one it's just g-force
now but Google's version yeah kind of LT
x b YC update is there one sold out oh
yeah I think I think that's all I just
meant e^x update in general the LT x
blog has 10 years of gaming PC PCs booth
posted today 10 years of gaming PCs
booth so anything to do with the BYOC
well this this drawing that Linus did is
straight up tended to Linus actually do
that I guess it was him it wasn't Colton
I don't know that is paint that is
straight up and that's paint what the
heck look at those arrows like the line
from the arrow intersect at the point oh
my goodness this computer is just
falling off the edge standing desk don't
want people sitting there all day make
them move along no loitering employee oh
that's pretty cool ooh Starcraft 2 so a
a physically lined up ten different
games one year each so you can kind of
float them between them and see how I
like graphics and stuff are developed
with a conveyor belts it just ya know
lawyer you gotta move it or lose it
sister else we got luke black home I
know it looks funky today right yeah he
played runescape yes I have I played
runescape when my internet was so slow
that I would launch it in my browser go
out on stairs make a sandwich and make
some peach juice bring my sandwich my
peach juice upstairs the details tells
me the story is real and it is and
mostly eat it before the game but lunch
I played it back then and I having my
phone now but I played for like four
minutes and was like wow online game I
didn't know that yeah I remember like
seeing it around
but I never knew anyone who played it
never played it yeah I was pretty into
it when I was like a real little dude
here in Montana we have a government
company that for a week we had a company
take two billion dollars in government
funding for Internet infrastructure and
embezzled it nice Wow cool that is uh
Google shock is dual do do ya guys move
to your left you're off center yeah I
think we're off center most of the
stream oh well you've seen the info but
the epics store reading steam user info
files yeah I heard something about that
too like the epic stores kind of creepy
which which throws me off a bit at is
sprinting resizes is going to something
very important PC gaming is a huge boon
population since 2013 when Metro last
light came out I don't think that's why
that happened oh I see what you're
saying okay
exodus has also been absolutely
everywhere in piece of gaming news sales
numbers shouldn't be a surprise yeah
that's actually a pretty good point yeah
since 2013 especially because of
streaming PC gaming has exploded there's
way more people in PC gaming now than
there was before Intel has seen the
first increase in like gaming PC CPU
sales for desktop in a long time fairly
recently pretty crazy
also Metro Exodus is like one of the
most talked-about games this year and
and yeah the whole the whole ecosystem
has changed so much 2013 with streaming
and eSports that every aspect of it is
so different now so epic being like just
about the game is a little ridiculous
especially because at least I know with
Hades I don't know if this happened with
Metro Exodus but I feel like it did I
just don't have any facts for this I do
know with Hades the epic store was
promoting Hades oh yeah elsewhere an
epic bought out that exclusivity so
they're just trying to promote a game
that they I will certainly can see that
that that statistics two and a half
times better that is pretty misleading I
still think that the overall point of
people care the content is king and yes
they're not too loyal yes I still think
that stance I do
with that yeah but with that the show's
over I'll see you next week boom later
folks that's it I almost just tried to
turn OBS off on the laptop but that's
not how that works well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
