of the gigabyte g1 killer series of
gaming motherboards g1 assassin it has a
really cool box for starters it comes
with a three year warranty it is an LGA
1366 motherboard which means it's got
full support for Intel's Core i7 and
core i7 extreme processors on the LGA
1366 Intel x58 platform so don't go
trying to put your 1155 for 1156 CPU in
here it won't work
ok other technologies that we're gonna
see right off the bat here are x5 sound
killer gaming networking ok so this is
probably the most feature-rich gaming
motherboard I have ever had the
opportunity to have a look at because
gigabyte has not only you know added
more USB ports and you know added more
bullet points to the back of most funny
I should say bullet because it's all
about bullets this particular theme here
but they've actually included
technologies that are highly relevant to
gamers and to me better sound is one
that most gamers don't really seem to
understand that they need but they do
including a built-in front audio
headphone amplifier that's huge
that's enormous they've also taken care
to use higher-quality capacitors on all
of the sound or the sound parts of the
board so that you're gonna have good
filtering in it so it's not going to
have a high noise to sound ratio or
rather will have a much higher sound to
noise ratio here we've got okay we've
got an onboard creative soundblaster
x-fi digital audio processor so all of
that is included let's see what else
they've got to say about themselves
SuperSpeed so the onboard Bigfoot killer
ii 2100 game networking platform so you
guys have probably heard of the killer
Nick we actually did an episode about it
this basically for all intents and
purposes has a dedicated killer Nick
built onto it front access control panel
for 2 USB 3.0 ports and power to eSATA
it includes support for SATA 3 6 gigabit
per second and USB 3
super-shield here so this is actually
just the heatsink design which looks
pretty sweet we're gonna take the board
out to show you guys that and it also
has D this is another feature that I've
wanted to see on more gaming
motherboards smart fan connectors so
those are going to allow you to actually
commander about that to actually
configure how the fans connected to all
of those headers behave and I don't see
it yet but we're gonna find out if those
are 4 pin pwm connectors or if they're
standard 3 pin connectors ok the board
itself no no I'm not gonna let you look
at that yet first we're gonna do
accessories really quick here all right
so we got a poster this is the g1 killer
gaming motherboard so there's three
different boards in this series the
assassin the sniper and the gorilla so
they're all featured here on the back of
the board is a target or the back of the
board on the back of the poster is a
target next we have some stickers these
are pretty sweet stickers so we've got
bullet stickers these are all individual
bullets so you can put them wherever you
want we've got some bullet holes we've
also got a g1 killer sticker okay oh
we've got some more look at that some
more g1 killer one for each side of your
case more bullets more bullet holes next
we have a user's manual as well as a
driver disk so don't use this download
the latest from the gigabyte website box
contents okay nice multilingual
installation guide book just in case you
need it next we have actually let's look
at this purse so this is our front panel
thing so we've got quick boost which is
an overclocking button eSATA slash USB
so that's a powered eSATA and two USB
3.0 so that goes in a five and a quarter
inch base next we've got a gigabyte
sticker although that's not as cool as
all those other stickers we saw Dolby
home theater sticker and we've got an
i/o shield which is conveniently labeled
in terms of all the different connectors
on the back we have a 3-way SLI bridge
and gigabytes classic color scheme so
you might want to get yourself a black
SLI bridge to go with this board if you
are going to install that as well as one
crossfire bridge and one SLI bridge and
finally we have four SATA cables two are
straight and
you are right angle cables so I'm going
to go ahead and close this because it
makes for a great digicam that is
digital camouflage not digital camera
digicam background for the motherboard
itself which I will eventually extract
from the packaging and this is a huge
board like enormous okay here we go so
the first thing let you know what let's
go you know I'm gonna do might know I'm
gonna do my standard approach to this so
the first thing we find is the CPU
socket here in the middle of the board
that is an LGA 1366 socket as I
mentioned before over here on the Left
we've got dual eight pin power connector
so you can provide a ton that is to say
a ton of juice to that CPU socket
without running into any power delivery
instability let's count the CPU power
phases we've got one two three four five
six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14 15
16 16 oh hold on give me a moment on
this one
so that is a 16 phase power design
around the CPU socket I think we also
already talked about these so let's work
our way over to the RAM we have support
for up to six dims in running in
triple-channel
so that is up to 24 gigabytes of memory
on this particular board you can see
here that the first ones we're going to
need to populate are the green ones
and once you've populated all of the
green ones then you can begin to
populate the black ones you've got a
fair amount of space around the CPU
socket in general which is so important
for a board like this where the reality
of it is nobody's using stock cooling on
a motherboard of this caliber so you
need lots of space around for
aftermarket cooling on the right hand
side of the board we've got our 24 pin
connector and it's ideal location we
also find moving on down the right that
we have all of our state of conductivity
so these six are going to be running at
SATA to three gigabit per second and
these two are gonna be running at SATA
three is six gigabit per second remember
guys the x58 platform and IC
ANR do not natively supports a 2/3 so
these are running off of a third-party
chipset and that is why you don't see
more say 2 3 6 gigabit per second
connectors on this board down at the
bottom we've got our front panel
connectors we've got 2 front USB 2 2
front USB 3 headers and then we have a
an auxilary molex power connector our
front audio in its ideal location this
is the first time I've seen front audio
here on a gigabyte motherboard usually
it's up here over by the audio chipset
but you can actually see the creative
chipset being used is down here so maybe
that's why they put it there in terms of
expansion here we go so we've got one
two three four PCI Express 16x
connectors none of them are two of them
are only wired for PCIe
8x so these two are wired for full PCIe
16x and you can see from the spacing
that those are the two your intended to
use for two-way SLI and then if you were
to run 3-way SLI you're probably going
to go one two three and four four-way
well I think the answer should be quite
obvious one two three four additional
connectors we have two PCIe 1x one PCI
slot so if you are running dual cards in
SLI you're going to be left with one
PCIe 8 X 1 PCIe 1x and a final PCIe 8 X
so here's all of the circuitry that is
involved in the built-in amplified
amplified motherboard audio ok we also
have up here the killer e 20 100 with
its dedicated Ram and so I think that's
pretty much it for the overall features
okay you know what let's have a look at
the cooling on this board because it's
pretty sweet-looking so the cooling on
this board is heat pipes with heat sinks
as we've come to pretty much expect at
this point from any decently high-end
motherboard we've also got some kind of
neat design elements here so you can see
that this particular heatsink is the
front of a pistol okay so if you look at
it from that angle you can see that's
the sight from the other side you can
see that's the barrel so that's kind of
neat the one
over here at the top doesn't seem to
have have that kind of a shape going for
it here we've got gaming motherboard
we've got some LEDs built in here
okay our Northbridge heatsink is very
very solid the reality of it is the x58
chipset doesn't require a ton of cooling
so gigabytes not concerned about the
thermal efficiency of this design I mean
it's more than adequate for cooling
everything we got here but they just
want it to look sweet and they have
definitely achieved that
now the Southbridge heatsink is just one
slab of metal and unlike some of them
other boards i've seen with huge cooling
heatsink solutions on them in the recent
past this one everything is constructed
entirely of metal so it's actually going
to contribute to cooling now this bottom
one is is a clip right there so you can
see it's actually got a bullet sticking
out the top of it and then on the bottom
a convenient little warning just just
for the special purchasers out there
heatsink not a weapon cannot be
assembled as a firearm so please put
that out of your mind
you won't be doing it that won't be
happening what else tell my show oh yeah
another thing I wanted to show you guys
is yes those controllable fan connectors
are all 4 pin pwm so there's one here
actually here just back out and I'll
show you where they are so we got one
here one here one here one here and
finally one here I also didn't point out
this other auxilary 4 pin power
connector now the reason these two are
here is because all of the motherboard
power comes from the 24 pin connector
traditionally these are just for the CPU
so that means if you install for
graphics card by spec all of them need
to pull a pretty decent amount of power
out of the board and then they only pull
the extra that they need from those
connectors at the back so if you plug in
4 high-powered GPUs and you don't use
these auxilary power connectors you can
actually burn the connectors here from
so much current running through them so
that's what gigabyte is trying to
prevent on their nice shiny high-end
motherboard so we've got some more power
delivery back here and this is a nice
touch I always like to see this proper
screws attaching the cooling solution
for the motherboard rather than
finn's because that's going to make sure
that if it gets hot or cold expands
contracts no matter what happens
everything is going to stay properly
attached I'm just looking at the board I
mean the overall color scheme of it I
think is great they're using their new
matte black PCB which I think looks
better than anyone elses PCB out there
the color scheme is phenomenal with a
nice gunmetal appearance to everything
and then a couple of green and black
accents I think it looks absolutely
outstanding it would actually be a great
pair for that halfbacks nvidia edition
right back there because this is not a
standard sized motherboard this is
actually a nine expansion slot
motherboard so you can see there's two
missing spots up here and then seven
expansion slots so this is longer than a
standard motherboard actually by a
fairly substantial margin you know give
me a sec I'll go grab one so just for
comparison sake here's the p67 AUD for
next to the g1 Assassin okay and you can
see that it is substantially shorter and
it is also substantially narrower so I'm
going to go ahead and put it on top and
I'll get the cameraman to come have a
look at how much wider this board is so
you can see the mounting holes here and
here there your mounting holes well yeah
there's more board to the side of this
one then there is on a standard sized
ATX motherboard so you gonna make sure
you need to have a special case to
accommodate a board like this let's go
ahead and have a look at the back panel
of connectors and I think that's pretty
much it we've got two dedicated ps2
connectors I do still like to see these
we've got coaxial audio out we have four
USB 2.0 four USB 3.0 Gigabit Ethernet
powered by big foot networks and then we
have 7.1 audio as well as an additional
digital audio output and that is optical
