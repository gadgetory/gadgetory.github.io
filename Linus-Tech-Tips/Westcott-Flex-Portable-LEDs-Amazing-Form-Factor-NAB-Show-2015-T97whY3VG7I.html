piece of gear that really gets ideas
going for me and surprisingly enough one
of those products is not a camera this
is the Westcott flex line of LED panels
line is Texas coverage of NAB 2015 is
brought to you by sennheiser kingston
and Linda calm so you might be thinking
what makes this lights so special while
many lighting manufacturers make LEDs
very few make them in such a portable
form factor to give you some context
when we travel for shows and other
projects I bring along a 312 LED light
that runs off of a couple of sony
batteries while the 312 works fine the
quality of the LEDs is not as good as I
would like it to be but I choose to
bring it because compared to other
solutions it's quite portable with
Wescott's Fleck flights I would no
longer have to worry about lugging large
lights that are hard to travel with when
I want more output than my small LED can
give me this light can be folded into
virtually any shape and because of its
thin profile and light construction I
would be able to put it nearly anywhere
I want the Flex light comes in a variety
of sizes all with dimmers or ballast
that could change the light in one
percent increments I see this light
being a potentially great option for the
new studio with his light weight set up
at small overall footprint compared to
other similar fixtures thank you guys
for watching let me know in the comments
down below or on the form what you think
of a flex light should we consider it
for the new studio thank you to
