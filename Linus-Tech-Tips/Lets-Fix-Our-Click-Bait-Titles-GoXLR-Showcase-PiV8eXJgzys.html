livestream welcome guys this is going to
be um this is gonna be a bit of an
interesting video so we have a couple of
main objectives first I just want to
thank TC Helicon for sponsoring the
video Oh Oh wrong one and we all knew
that was gonna happen I was gonna screw
that up so this is their go XLR and it's
the product that we're actually using to
capture audio for this and it can do a
lot more than that we'll talk a bit more
about the features later but first we're
gonna open this thing up but before we
do that even I also wanted to just say
sort of why we are why we're doing this
video so over the last I'd say about
three months we well no not over the
last three months so over the last
couple of years we have taken a lot of
negative feedback about the way that
we've been titling our videos so
sometimes I'd say that it's not really
fair so we'll call a video something
along the lines of here I'm just I'm
pulling up the YouTube dashboard here I
think this is the right scene cool yeah
no yes
that scene I'm gonna just throw a filter
on actually here I think I have this one
already yep cool so this is the the new
YouTube studio for those of you who
aren't familiar I really really don't
like it but it has this cool filter here
so that we won't see any of the
embargoed videos that we have for you
know testing purposes or whatever else
will only see real stuff that we upload
so sometimes I think it's it's not
really fair you know
so the weirdest video card we've ever
seen and we've got in the thumbnail here
it's it's kind of hard to see from here
maybe we can open up this in a new tab
so we've got a picture of a graphics
card and then we've got a picture of an
Ethernet cable next to it and that is in
my opinion completely fair and
representative of the content of that
video that video is about the weirdest
graphics card
foreseen because instead of outputting
to HDMI or DVI or DisplayPort or any
kind of traditional display interface it
outputs via ethernet and then it has
these special Ethernet to HDMI adapter
x' on the other end that will translate
that signal into something that a
display can understand however there
have also been cases where I think that
the criticism has been fair there's
there situations where we've pushed it a
little bit too far so I'll see if I can
find an example of that
sorry Razer I'm not switching now I mean
I'm clearly holding a laptop here the
desk fan for gaming some people wind
about the fastest Xbox of all time I
thought that was fine I mean it's an
Xbox enclosure yes it's not strictly
speaking an Xbox anymore because we did
take out all the components and put a PC
inside but I mean is the fastest Xbox of
all time it is it is what you think you
know what there's actually there's
actually a threat on the forum where
someone outlined a couple of things this
is Romano 2k not not a sort of huge
contributor to the forum or anything in
fact I think they just signed up to
complain about this but that I think is
demonstrative of how important it is for
us to address this so basically Romano
to case says I won't click we never
expected Nvidia to allow this how has
everyone overlooked this why would you
even Razer thought this was a good idea
or I can't believe this while saying
that a little bit clicky you know
water-cooled smartphone alien where's
crazy upgradable laptop you know says
that that that's okay so here's a
situation we actually created a video
boat man it must have been that's been
about a year and a year ago year and a
half ago
addressing the the more clicky
thumbnails that we've been using clicky
thumbnails and titles that we'd been
using on our videos
saying why we were doing it explaining
how the YouTube ecosystem has changed
such that in order to continue to grow
and continue to be sustainable as a
company it was something that we had
identified as not necessary but
certainly too helpful for us to continue
to ignore however I think over the last
especially over the last probably six
months I mean it's not like I haven't
been seeing this feedback it's just that
we are completely data-driven in terms
of the way that we alter our content the
way that we alter our thumbnails the way
we alter our titles pretty much
everything we do is driven by data in
some way shape or form
so until about the last three months we
didn't have any data to support that
this was having some kind of a negative
impact we did have people complaining
about it and we obviously take in those
data points but the actual YouTube
analytics so you know you're the things
that you can identify you're like
dislike or that you can quantify you're
like dislike ratio on your video the
retention of your video the overall
viewership of the channel the rate at
which people are subscribing the rate at
which people are unsubscribing and even
the demographics of your audience we
hadn't seen anything to support that
some kind of change was necessary over
the last few months we've actually
slumped a little bit I don't know if you
guys notice I I think that it's the kind
of thing that we obsess about here but
our viewers actually really aren't
looking that closely at especially cuz
we'll see we'll see really funny stuff
like people will bill they'll post on
the forum LTT is going downhill their
company has six months to go because of
these decisions that they're making and
it's bad and you know meanwhile we will
like it just actually happened that such
threads have popped up literally on the
heels like the day after we have our
highest recorded day for overall
viewership or like our highest overall
day for new subscribers or whatever it
is where the audience is clearly growing
and clearly engaged but over the last
few months we have actually slumped a
fair bit now we we reversed it a few
days ago but one thing that it's done is
it's made me a really look inward at
what we can do to alter the content and
alter the way that we engage with our
audience one of the things that is not
going away is sponsored videos so I'm
definitely going to walk you guys
through the go XLR why don't we take an
opportunity to do that now and then what
you guys are gonna do with me over the
next probably half an hour or so is we
are gonna work together to fix some of
the titles on the Linus tech tips
channel so on this monitor here I've got
up our channel analytics and everything
the the channel page so we can go
through and quickly make these changes
and then on my laptop here I've got both
floatplane chat and YouTube chat opens
so that I can see your guys suggestions
and we can achieve a couple of things
number one is we can improve the
relationship that we have you guys have
complained we hear you we're going to
fix this
number two we can address something that
has actually been a problem internally
as well and that is the search ability
of our older videos we've run into
situations where we want to refer back
we want to pull footage from an old
video referring back to something that
we've said or something that we've done
and we haven't been able to find the
bloody video and you know obviously with
the way that search on YouTube has
become increasingly less important why
don't we just say decreasingly important
not grammatically correct but we're
gonna go with it with the way that
search has become continually less and
less important compared to related
videos suggested videos all the ways
that YouTube algorithmically serves
content to the viewer base honestly
those less searchable titles haven't
affected things much is it's shocking
actually how little that has impacted
viewership so it's it's more about just
making it easier for us to find stuff
making it easier for those that those
small number of people who really want
to go back and find one of our old
videos and just saying like look guys we
hear you we need to fix this so the
compromise that I'm going to propose is
action
something that we have already begun to
implement over the last I'd say I mean
it's something that we've done off and
on actually pretty much all the time
even with some of the really clickable
stuff but it's something that we're
going to commit to keeping this way
moving forward with that said if things
change very dramatically and all of a
sudden like it doesn't work at all I'm
not locking myself into this I'm just
saying we hear you guys and we're gonna
do this we're gonna do our best to do
this so we're gonna do away with titles
like this fool me once now in my defense
that video was about a product where the
brand reached out to me told me it was
amazing flew all the way to my studio
demoed it for me and it was terrible and
then they did the same thing on a show
floor they pulled me into their booth
telling me it was going to be amazing so
that that really was representative of
at least if nothing else my feelings
about the experience of this company
however it's just not descriptive enough
so here's the compromise we will leave
something clickable something enticing
because the reality of it is if we just
put product model number review
impressions first look it we're not
gonna grow we might even shrink that
might actually spell the end of us over
the long term I'm sorry but that's the
way YouTube works but what we can do is
we can go PI max aka VR headset first
impressions
that way everything stays searchable and
we are still able to do what we have to
do because that's the way YouTube is so
I'm just gonna go ahead and go back to
the beginning here so you guys all have
probably seen this on the last few
videos that we've done so yesterday's
video is a classic example if we had
called this video running Mac OS in a
virtual machine which if we're being go
yourself that's that's a feature of this
go XLR by the way I'm using one of them
right now I will I will get to like what
I'm doing with this thing a little bit
later but uh anyway if we had called it
that we might have expected that video
to perform about average and this is
something we really do have a lot of
experience with whereas if we call it
Apple won't like this everyone's gonna
be like Oh what won't have to like
because people can't help themselves
but again the compromise here is Apple
won't like this - so that's going to be
the way that we're going to denote the
clickable title from the what the heck
we're actually doing title we go run Mac
OS on any PC and that is what we're
doing because of the magic of
virtualization hackintosh inge becomes
something that you can not only do but
thanks to the fact that when you virtual
eyes you don't have to worry so much
about platform specific tweaks that have
to be done every time Apple updates
their OS it's just this one that needs
to be updated and maintained the chances
of that hackintosh remaining usable over
a long period of time are much better so
that that is our point that's
fundamentally what we're trying to say
now I've had a lot of people okay you
know what I'll get into this later I
promised I was gonna I was gonna open up
the glass floor so this thing is really
cool basically what it does is it's not
cheap like it's about four hundred US
dollars for one of these puppies Jake do
you mind taking that thank you sir it's
about four hundred US dollars for one of
these but it takes the place
of a good number of other devices that
you would otherwise need so if you want
to use an XLR microphone you're going to
need an XLR interface because your
computer doesn't natively have just like
an XLR input on the back of it if it's a
if it's a normal computer you're also
going to need depending on your XLR mic
many of them are going to need a preamp
you also may depending on how sort of
sophisticated you want your audio setup
to be you also may want compression for
a gate so this is meant to be the
one-size-fits-all of all of that
functionality oh right and also a mixer
in practice how it works is actually
quite a bit cooler than that so instead
of doing any of the any of the features
that it has instead of doing them in
software it's all handled by dedicated
Hardware within this thing and it's got
a bunch of additional like voice effects
you can it's got a sampler hold on a
second this is really great so if I was
to say something like Jake sucks then
I'd be able to make Jake socks like Jake
socks oh I got the timing just wrong
that's ok anyway so you've got you can
censor yourself you can sample things
you can add effects and the really kind
of killer thing that absolutely blew us
away was actually on the software side
so they've got this software interface
here I'm going to go ahead and pull up
this so they've got this this software
application but what's cool about it is
everything that one moment please what
just fell I heard shattering okay good
the the quasar did not break it was only
the fat picture frame okay anyway man
sorry guys I had nothing to do with that
let the record show I had nothing to do
with that anyway back to this so what's
cool about their software
is that it's all just control of the
dedicated audio processing hardware
that's within the go XLR so you can do
all kinds of stuff like I could adjust
my bass to go heavier towards the art
might be my bass my voice to go heavily
on the bass side I could remove treble
the problem for me is that sorry put
this back the problem for me is if I do
that actually completely removes play
it's just kind of a shame I can adjust
my compressor including all the
functionality that you'd get off of like
a standalone hardware compressor okay
not all of it but a lot of it all the
key important stuff gating right here
de-essing okay mixing so this is pretty
sweet see all these controls over here
so you got your mic your chat your music
whether it's something like Spotify or
something else that use for music all of
these so all of these outputs and all of
your inputs can be completely reassigned
so let's go ahead and go over to the
routing thing here so this is really
cool you've got your outputs which are
controlled with your little sliders here
so I'm gonna adjust my microphone you
can see here boom a little something
like that I can mute it check this out
the the knob goes all the way down and
then all the way back up so it's a like
totally unnecessarily cool thing I've
seen this on mixers before but I guess
they were like what the hey we could do
it why not pretty cool and then you can
adjust whether it's okay here why don't
we go ahead and fire up some music
here's a song I know we have the right
sport
so I've adjusted it so that music here
we go goes to my line out hold on a
second here we go broadcast remix so can
they not hear music anymore
theoretically I think big can sorry
what's that we're using line out okay so
I can new music for you and then I could
listen to it myself I can put the music
on for me and mute it for myself and I
can make all these adjustments in part
because the way that they've configured
it's like like it's just a USB interface
but it creates all of these like virtual
interfaces so I'm gonna fire up sound
settings that's what I'm just gonna turn
the music down mute that so check this
out
you fire up your different apps you go
okay ah
Spotify oh it's not working because I
didn't change it ah so output there we
go is go XLR music there we go know that
I can leave it default yeah there we go
alright cool so now I can adjust it dang
it I am muted right now there's our
problem there we go sick so I can
control where it goes so now I'm gonna
go ahead and I'm gonna take it off of
the off of the line out boom or I can
have it on my headphones yes
everything's working now
good I in less flustered now I can if I
just wanted music for my stream but I
don't actually want to hear it because I
want to focus on my game I can go ahead
and turn it off for myself
and then I can just easily adjust all my
levels adjust them turn it off check it
again turn it down okay
like that so much it's pretty freakin
sick all right yes everything is working
exactly the way it's supposed to know
Jake is there anything else that's
really cool that I should show them in
the software
oh yeah that's really cool okay so if we
go into system lighting uh sorry oh
sorry mixer lighting there we go
mixer lighting so by default the the
LEDs here that are on the side of each
of the sliders are just indicating your
volume which to me is not necessarily
that useful so you can adjust that and
you can I have the scaling really wonky
on this monitor actually don't can I
move over oh if I had logged back out
and log back in I probably wouldn't have
this problem right now that is that is
quite unfortunate out of 10 and I can't
even get down to the thing to just see
oh yes yes
scrolling does it yay okay cool so you
can change the style to meter and then
now you can guys can actually see here
that you're getting levels on here
instead so I can do the same thing for
can you make it a gradient oh okay oh
that's pretty cool so it goes from blue
to red so bottom color we could go green
and then top color we could go red hello
hello hello just like that pretty cool
right and then we can do the same thing
on our music so if I were to turn my not
meet my music same thing
cool right uh what else should I show
them what else is like kind of critical
yeah the effects are pretty cool so if
you press the FX button I apologize in
advance I'm just gonna switch out to
here actually no I'll leave it I'll
leave it robust so I'm gonna go to the
effects button I don't know what we
sorry guys we were kind of playing
around with this before the stream so
there's a reverb dial here you don't you
don't have to use that though we can we
can turn the reverb all the way down
there's echo Wow there's the pitch
adjustment so you can turn your pitch up
like this or you can turn it a little
down like this and again these are all
Hardware applied effects as opposed to
being handled in software and taking our
pressure CPU cycles while you're trying
to stream I'm gonna turn that back up to
normal
there's also kind of just some you know
you can say okay I want to be robot now
this is the kind of thing that I think
for a lot of streamers is not going to
be a huge deal but for others if they're
if you're like I don't know if you're
one of those like GTA 5 role players for
example or something like that you want
to alter your voice depending on what
character you're playing they've got six
different presets up here and then all
these different adjustments that you can
make so you can just kind of have fun
with it I guess one of the one of the
coolest things for me is actually this
button right here so this is the swear
button so if I was to say something like
Jake you duck up again then you can
actually you can actually self censor
and I mean sensors it's just fun because
even if you're not even swearing it's
just like you know what I just think and
and I've never even seen anyone get like
sensory it's just funny I love it
also fun to play with is the sampler so
the way that one works is you go ahead
and you think you're gonna say something
funny like like whoa oh shoot I didn't
clear that one
so you clear them by pressing clear and
then clearing the button you've also got
three different sort of layers of these
and then you can use the software to
create multiple profiles so you can
depending on what game you're playing or
if there's like certain buddies that you
want to have your you know your troll
samples ready or whatever you can have
different profiles for that so you just
be like you know like headshot like
headshot but headshot headshot no
whatever whatever you're into right so
that's that's pretty fun as well um
anything else critical that I did I kind
of missed here I said it's expensive
yeah right yeah so that's a good point
so yes it's expensive but all that audio
hardware does cost a lot of money and is
quite a bit more complicated to set up
this was simple enough that I was able
to figure it out and I think any of our
longtime viewers will know that my track
record for live streaming audio is not
fantastic I think would be a nice way of
putting it not fantastic it's it's all
you need you just grab an XLR microphone
you can even use it with a USB
microphone as long as it has like a
three-and-a-half millimeter monitor out
so it has like a line in and all that
can be reassigned in the software and
you can remap it and it's not
complicated which is which is pretty
sweet
so the way we have our sliders setup are
for my microphone so just like that
we've got music which I've got turned
off because we don't need to listen to
slew supernova for this entire stream
we've got chat which I actually don't
think does anything for us right now and
then we've got system so if I was to
just you know hit the windows volume
check
just like that cool right alright so now
why don't we get into then helping me
rename our videos I'm gonna start with
like how far back do we want to go here
alright oh cool
actually that is an amazing example of
when this would be useful so I fired up
this the stream window here and it's
like oh shoot
oops boom system is an amazing example
or muted yes yes fun
um wait oh right they couldn't I was
looking at your thing okay yeah anyway
sorry I had the I opened up flow plane
because I wanted to be able to see the
chat there and the stream was actually
live this actually looks pretty good
good work you guys okay so how far back
do we want to go I'm watching you guys
I've got floatplane and YouTube
side-by-side and I think oh sorry sorry
I was trying to window snap that that
did not work that worked better now
oh no the floatplane chat is not showing
when I have it to Oh Jack forgot
something I have to adjust my hair oh I
know this is like the worst haircut I've
had in a while like check this out
so just like look how uneven that is
it's like they weren't even trying so I
told them I wanted it like a like a
finger length and a half when they then
they cut it and so they took the front
and we're just like yeah it seems about
right and then did the whole rest of it
like evenly see but then this is just
like random so I'm just I'm gonna grab
some scissors and fix it myself
like literally groans man and cutting my
own hair alright so let's do it let's uh
let's go let's go back I think where
it's gonna be easier for us to find like
really egregious examples if we move a
little bit further back
oh did I know I didn't
the Oh Oh okay that's that's possible I
left the trouble up no I didn't oh shut
up okay yeah I'll do that
yeah I did I did not that is just
actually what my voice sounds like and
that's with like a really nice
microphone oh alright so I'm going back
about I don't know this is I hate the
new dashboard so much okay so we're
going back to about why don't we go back
to last year and I'll let you guys kind
of tell me which ones you think are
really bad and which ones you think are
all right then
this is gonna be tough because I'm gonna
have a hard time figuring out like which
what these videos were actually about in
some cases so one plus six leaks
confirmed hands on that that seemed
pretty fair Jake you can also you can
also weigh in on these if you want
yeah that's an LTTE video as opposed to
what else would you think so it was a
hands on with the phone okay
so first impressions I think first
impressions so this was at their this
was at their their show floor if I
recall correctly okay first impressions
okay one plus six quality control
exposed I think it's pretty fair to say
a couple of things here number one that
it wouldn't have done four point three
million views if we had called it one
plus factory tour but I think it's also
fair to say that that was not not
necessarily the most representative hold
on I'm just gonna for some reason flow
plans not do anything maybe get rid of
the exposed yeah I don't even okay so
here's the thing I don't want to adjust
the titles too much because you never
know YouTube claims
but it doesn't matter YouTube claims it
makes no difference
I think that's BS like adjusting a
videos titles after the facts because we
have run into examples where we've
adjusted titles and it does seem to have
a profound effect on the performance of
the video but I want to make sure that
in all cases there's something properly
descriptive that's in the title so I
think if we just changed it to 1 +
factory tour at the end does that seem
fair
people don't like exposed you know
what's funny is I actually with the CE o
ZZ Co oh I can't remember fee Co o or
CEO but one of their c-level executives
I over this word as well they were not
stoked on it and I have I've put a lot
of effort into using that word
people want revealed okay well fine
floatplane I mean the point of us doing
this together is that I will give in and
I will do I will do what you guys ask so
fine I guess we don't really need one
plus can I call it an epic factory tour
it was pretty awesome what you think can
I get away with that I'm Jake's nodding
you know what I'm gonna do it unless you
guys are like really really mad about
epic okay fine let's move on to the next
one save money on RAM with op teen okay
what this was was a sponsored showcase
from Intel where we demonstrated that
with obtain you can you know what was
our point here oh no oh yeah that's
right oh I can't believe Intel sponsored
this they've actually in the last year I
think they've I think it's fair to say
they've gotten a little more
conservative about their product
messaging because we were using obtained
as a as like a ram disk or something
weren't we what are we doing with it
yeah it was not it was not like a
supported use case that really was kind
of a crazy experiment
okay floatplanes telling me they want
intel in there saying that title is fine
put showcase in the title you know what
that is that is a fair point
octane I save money I'm around with
obtained showcase yeah we can throw
intel showcase in there alright that's
fair
let's do it cuz that's really the only
thing that's non-descriptive about that
although in fairness to us thanks to
Intel for sponsoring this video we do a
pretty good job of making sure that that
stuff is above the fold cutting open a
laser key switch bloody gaming LK switch
showcase I think that's pretty good as
it is I'm not gonna bother with LAN show
guys
just to be clear LAN show is what it is
if you click on LAN show not knowing
that you're clicking on LAN show then
you you get what's coming to you I think
to a certain extent what the heck is an
AI phone on our 10 showcase that seems
pretty fair to me yeah 1 plus 6 review
top notch that seems fair no ok alright
I'm gonna jump over to floatplane saying
honors fair find reasonable
thank you guys I'm gonna jump over to
youtube over here cuz I'm sure people
are like super chatting and I'm not
seeing those ah no actually people
people are super chatting bad haircut
Linus Thank You Robin
appreciate that instead of okay hold on
a second this is important to address so
double Pudge actually super chatted
I think people complain too much and you
shouldn't give in to their every issue
you're right and that's why over the
last two years we have continued to use
clickable titles because without them we
wouldn't be able to sustain the 25
people that work here and I know there's
people who disagree that we should have
25 people working here but the cold hard
truth is that videos like that
hackintosh one yesterday that took
anthony a week I had an entire writer
working on that for a week between all
the prep getting it working getting all
the screencap that we needed the actual
shoot itself cue seeing the final video
like all that stuff takes time from a
quality standpoint our content is better
today than it has ever been
and
we can't do that without the staff that
we have so we we want all those people
on staff but that doesn't necessarily
mean that till right so we do have to
take advantage of well every advantage
we can get whether it's a title or
thumbnail or whatever the case may be
but we also can't lose track of the fact
that without our audience we don't get
to do this
none of us all the way from our brand
new hires who can't have their names out
there yet because they're still on
probation through to Anthony who's been
here for almost two and a half years now
to me I founded the company none of us
could do this without our community and
so we have to ignore the haters you know
the one offs but this has been something
that has been such a sustained criticism
and not just from people who are like
but people who are putting together a
very cogent arguments for why we should
address it that we just we can't we
cannot ignore it we have to we have to
respect our audience because without
them or nothing let's go ahead and jump
over to the screen again one plus six
review top notch I think that's fine I'm
gonna jump back to floatplane chat since
I don't see anything over here um I can
see what you bought online okay so this
is and I'm holding an Amazon box
specifically that's for a reason so this
is one of those what are our viewers
buying episodes and I don't remember
what we used to call them exactly
because we've actually done a handful of
them but I don't even really know what
to put in there so I can see what you
bought online so Amazon I feel like okay
so this is really funny so Amazon used
to call it the I like Amazon affiliate
program but their contract for it which
we know from experience they are very
particular about enforcing prohibits us
from representing ourselves as though we
are affiliated with Amazon in any way
which were not I'm gonna be real clear
about that because I don't want to run
afoul of their rules so I'm almost
afraid to put Amazon affiliate
in the title because they actually
changed the program to Amazon Associates
but people aren't gonna know what that
means they're gonna be like oh uh
Fillion programs so Amazon how about
that viewers yeah that's a good
suggestion Brian Lyon viewers Amazon
purchases analyzed well look I know it's
long shorter titles work better like
this is this is what it is but this is a
video that's probably mostly run its
course by now anyway oh I remember what
we called that series how about we throw
viewers choice in their beers choice
because that's what we had called that
content previously oh oh I went and put
it as dead and analyzed I'm sorry you
guys I'm my bad my bad my bad okay
hopefully you guys are cool with viewers
choice I'm honestly happy with this
title this $2,000 PC case shouldn't
exist because it really shouldn't but we
could put mbx mk2 in there I'm kind of
tempted to call it a showcase just
because that's kind of what the video
content was but the problem with that is
that we weren't paid for it so it's not
a review because it's more of like
honestly it's more of a profile of
Charles through his product and I've
known Charles a long time than it is an
evaluation of the case in any meaningful
way but you know what now flood plain
says it's fine just leave it okay three
security features every notebook should
have HP EliteBook showcase showcase that
seems pretty fair 12 kilometer Wi-Fi
success this is not a sponsored thing
from ubiquity the only things they
provided were of course the dishes and
they sent out a tech to help us which
has a cost for them but not a revenue
opportunity for us so I think that seems
pretty fair iceberg says don't keep
showcase to always mean sponsored video
that really is our intent with that
we want that to be really clear for our
viewers when you see showcase that's
your opportunity to go I want no part of
it
one thing where we have I think we've
muddied the waters a little bit as I'm
going through I'll be able to verify
that but if we think something really
stands alone as straight-up good enough
to be a video on its own actually an
example of that would be we have an
upcoming video that LG sponsored but
it's actually not really about LG's
product that they they wanted us to to
demonstrate or that they bet they're you
know this video is brought to you by
this product so what it is is it's a
factory tour of Meridian audio who is
this super high-end audio equipment
manufacturer based out of the UK who LG
collaborated with on their X boom
Bluetooth speaker so Meridian has some
of their special sauce like their their
claim to fame is really their their DSPs
I mean they do other stuff I mean
honestly this place is incredible don't
miss that tour it's a really great video
anyway but but their DSPs are one of
their really special sauce things that
they do and they've got some of that in
this X boom but the meat of the video is
really this tour of Meridian audio who
actually didn't pay for anything so it's
like it's this weird gray area where
obviously we are where we fully disclose
that the video sponsored biology is
within the first like 10 seconds of me
talking and we do a shout out for the X
boom before we cut to our animated intro
and then we do functionally an
integration for the X boom at the end
where we talk about you know well this
is everything you just saw
that's why LG partnered with Meridian
for the X boom so it's like sponsored by
LG but it's not an LG showcase in any
meaningful way yeah I don't know I'll
maybe I'll cross that bridge when I get
to it
in the meantime cheap Aliexpress
graphics cards scam that seems fairly
descriptive to me
and I am loath to change that title
given that video did 5 million views
we bought cheap graphics cards off
Aliexpress and we asked are they a scam
which is exactly what we were wondering
Brian Leon says you know what's
hilarious let's fix our clickbait titles
seems like a clickbait title that's what
we're doing is it not okay come on help
me out here you guys okay so people are
cool at that one dude raise your screw
up blade 2018 classic unboxing that
seems pretty fair nest cams are a big
ripoff okay guys because of the stream
delay when you're typing in the chat
like which one you think is okay you got
to let me know which one it is because
some of you are gonna be more delayed
than others nest cams are a big ripoff
so Jake you actually worked on this
video that was our clickable title
because there was no way we were gonna
get one-and-a-half million views and
remember this it's not like people hated
the video 97 percent like to just like
ratio with 45 K likes that's actually
really solid for a video with that many
views but I think it's fair to say that
we could put DIY Wi-Fi security camera
guide okay sorry sorry sorry capitalize
lui fee look correctly okay oh no people
said the next one was fine before you
know what yeah it probably was but the
purpose of this exercise is to make it
more descriptive why is everyone buying
this tablet I'm actually particularly
proud of this this particular series
that we that we came up with why is
everyone buying it was an excuse for us
to to cover more mundane products that
are just like stuff people actually want
to buy without having to resort to
without having to call it fire seven
tablet review which no one's gonna watch
no one's gonna click on
it's an Amazon bestseller we could we
could throw that in there people saying
you should do more of those yeah we
actually really should people want fire
seven in there okay all right all right
why is everyone buying this tablet that
is on fire seven fine oh sorry I'm on
the sorry I I did it I did it you guys
have to take my I take my word for it
there you go Amazon fire seven world's
craziest five gigahertz laptop Asus g7
no 3G I don't know I think that's pretty
fair that's me and Alex like cooking
blowing Mitrano up to a laptop to hit
five gigahertz oh wait is it the fire HD
eight did I screw that up
thank you I actually couldn't remember
which one it was
dang it why do we have fire seven in
there no I think you guys might be drunk
I think we might have compared it to the
fire HD eight or something like that
okay uh Jake can you make a note for us
to figure that out later or can you
check or something okay world's craziest
five gigahertz laptop everyone says that
one's fine cool all right
completely wireless power holy oh oh
nice completely wireless power holy
people wanted it oh okay
we're eyeless power I mean that's what
it was it's wireless power no one seems
to be complaining about that one
why is everyone buying this TV okay yeah
TCL 55 whatever 405 let's throw that in
there that's what we decided was was
fair for that one completely wireless
power you guys want the product name the
thing though is that that product name
is totally non recognizable ah like what
are Y charges okay okay
completely wireless
man how do we have why charge why charge
technology like I don't know it's not a
showcase so again this is one of those
situations where they definitely
contributed value monetarily like they
paid for plane tickets for themselves to
come out here bring all their stuff and
do a demo for us in our studio which is
very generous of them they didn't pay
any money we just really wanted to
feature the product so it's not a
showcase ok disgruntled snowman says yes
unrecognizable
unless you want to buy the thing Oh
unless you want to buy the thing so much
fun ok fair enough fair enough
ok fair enough
does size really matter ok this is a
fairly egregious example and honestly
this video didn't even perform well so
how about we just throw tubing in there
and then that's probably good enough I
would think you know what yeah we can
remove all the caps does tubing size
really matter no you don't want the caps
in there either
does water cooling well ok what do you
want
can we have really matter is really
matter ok do you want it all capitalized
oh ok yeah so we haven't okay we don't
have a set in stone way of handling
capitalization in our titles sometimes
we treat them like there are sentence
other times we treat them like they're a
title in this question because this is a
complete sentence
sometimes the temptation is to not
capitalize it whereas if we were to call
it
okay water cooling tube sighs does it
matter that I would I would say I would
capitalize correctly you know what that
seems pretty good I'm gonna go with that
Chloe says I agree with Jake lmao fine
okay for tonight on the God of gaming
monitors yeah this this was not yeah
what is this model called it's a Seuss
PG whatever the crap yeah let's put that
in there yeah let's put that in there
4k 144 Hertz yeah okay this was I
believe first look this remove four okay
come on guys can I have a kind of have a
look at I think fortnight but we don't
play apex legends okay that that is
clickbait that's misleading if we were
to put Apex legends in there after the
fact although that would be brilliant
remove fortnight guys come on okay look
look okay here's the thing
Chloe says fortnight equals biggest
clickbait that's not fair
if you play fortnight on it it's not
click bait that's something that has
made it
I'd say easier for me to ignore
community feedback about the thanks Jake
thank you for that that's something that
has made it so that I've kind of gone
yeah community feedback maybe they're
not really right about this because a
lot of the times things get called
clickbait when they're not clickbait is
defined as something that is misleading
you are baiting cliques by misleading
the viewer into thinking that it's
something that it's not
we played fortnight on that monitor and
I could make a pretty strong argument
for especially at that time remember
this isn't June last year that being the
God of gaming monitors no clickbait
clicky oh yes
clickable yeah clickbait no okay
Kubo 6472 says gaming on the god of
monitors that's actually pretty good
oh sorry about that alright let's do it
let's do it gaming on the god of
monitors you know what I like it I like
it
I'm not putting 2018 in the title do you
have any idea how brutal that is that's
like that's like that's like telling
YouTube hi I would like you to bury this
video please never have anybody look at
it again that's actually part of the
reason that we do put the date on when
show we don't want people watching old
land shows by accident thinking that
it's like something relevant all right
it finally happened RGB psu cables that
seems alright that seems alright and I'm
not putting 2019 in there that's wrong
too that's the real Luke Asus gaming
phone looks awesome that seems pretty
fair do you remember what this thing was
called Jake ROG phone yeah yep this was
our G phone first look no I want gaming
in there oh my guess we could do that a
Seuss's ROG gaming phone no no I want to
leave it this way because it was
specifically the ROG phone like they
might have an ROG phone to or something
so I want to leave ourselves I don't
leave ourselves options for that okay a
CPU cooler with a screen yeah we could
throw what it's actually called in there
I think oh wow we don't even have it
down here mmm it's like the ryujin right
is that how it's spelled can you can you
check for me yeah sorry
Hughie's s asks what's the product name
for the RGB psu cable frankly it doesn't
matter no one should buy it it's really
stupid region ok region a i/o first look
boom Corsair may
maybe the RGB king what is this video
even about honestly I don't know and it
doesn't say down here oh lord have we
gotten to the point where we have to
actually watch it okay
we've reached the first one that we
actually need to watch system slider
going up
I don't know I'm about to find out I'm
actually not sure because I may not have
assigned that correctly give me give me
one second is it muted oh well there's
your problem okay I don't know what to
say about RGB anymore but Corsair has
kicked it up yet another not with what
they're calling IQ a Corsair interface
they're taking everything that was good
about link all about I can instead have
curved
cannot be individually adjusted within
the software but on authors like d
skills try it ok RGB so basically it's
IQ and then their vengeance RGB pro okay
I can't put I'm sorry guys I can't put
all of that in there yeah yeah okay okay
um IQ announcement Computex no you let's
just put like you announcement I think
that's pretty fair because the main
thing with the RGB memory was that it
has IQ integration people are so mad and
floatplane chat about about IQ they just
don't like it okay okay the problem with
putting course our booth to her in is
that everyone assumes when you when you
when you do that everyone assumes that
it's like it doesn't have much
information in it whereas I think that
one we actually do a reasonably good job
of over viewing it I'd like to leave it
without that it's one of those is one of
those things like putting the date in
the title that just you're kind of
shooting yourself in the foot for no
real benefit most HDR is bullcrap oh boy
yep so that we're there we were
featuring some monitor or other oh boy
this is
that's tough okay I don't remember what
your sorry guys that's uh contrast wow
this is going to take a long time PA 32
UX alrighty then a sous pro art PA 32 UX
first look that seemed pretty fair and
and oh you guys are so nice
savage Phoenix says most HDR is kind of
bad and was way worse back then yeah
right and it's not even bad it's like it
was like actually but like oh sorry
sorry sorry I'm enjoying this like swear
button way more than I probably should
because in many cases things were being
advertised as like HDR but the whole
quite honestly kind of bullcrap HDR HDR
400 HDR 600 thing that came out later I
don't even think that was ratified yet
so it was just honestly kind of false
advertising a lot of the HDR displays
that were coming out around that time
all right
AMD's 32 core fu to Intel I don't know
what would we call this we did not have
oh I guess I could just put I could just
put it in no cuz I don't think it's
strictly speaking thread Ripper - this
was like thread Ripper refresh so the
good news though is we actually know the
model of that now so we could just put
thread Ripper 2990 WX first look no easy
BAM
oh did I put fists look see this is why
I need you guys you guys are your cue
seeing the whole process for me here you
guys Rock
alright wine show we skip crazy cooler
prototype no pump okay this doesn't have
a product name so why don't I just throw
der Bower in there and then that's
really all we can do about it there were
so many people who thought that this was
fake and it's not there that's all I
have to say about that okay all screen
notebook concept I think that's pretty
fair my thoughts it's an all screen
notebook and it's a concept and these
are my thoughts on it Oh
people want prototype okay so a Seuss
was really uh Wow I do remember more
about this from that I thought a Seuss
was pretty particular they did not want
prototype because it's not a prototype
it's a concept it's actually a different
thing this is not the prototype for
something they will build this is a
concept for something that maybe they
could build oh did I accidentally put it
I'll bloody hell I know the eight is a B
and just I'm trying to livestream at the
same time all scream notebook concept
that has to stay concept linus visits
the sketchiest sites on the web yeah
this really probably should have had a
bit defender showcase sorry about that
guys that one slipped through the cracks
why would anyone you build a huge pc
this is about whether there's any
benefit to large chassis I don't think
anything really needs oh that year says
oh so actually brands tell you what not
to put in some cases yes brands will
tell us look we'd really like I could
have done anything I wanted it's not
like the video was sponsored or anything
like not paying me for what I call it
but they did ask very nicely that I not
call it a prototype because it isn't
that would actually be misleading a
prototype implies that this will become
a finished product at some point and
they don't want people to think that and
they're not going to show this concept
to people who are going to call
in a prototype because the last thing
they want is customers banging down
their door for four years asking for
this the finished product of this
prototype they showed off when they were
never sure that they were even gonna do
one like that's that's stupid that
creates a negative situation
Magne says yes that's a good point
prototype would have been clickbait
because that's not what it was
so this is a this is a situation where a
soos is clarifying what the thing
actually is as opposed to dictating what
we may or may not title our videos I can
tell you for a fact that a soos has been
the victim of us calling videos things
they were super not impressed with
multiple times like it's not like that's
a thing so why don't we do why do we do
one more raiser wishes they thought of
this yeah sure that's probably one
that's fair for us to fix what at MSI
called that future Jake i legit don't
remember let's just let's just do it i
muted it all right all right
sick all right tangerine let's go okay
all right so it is this call that player
all right although this one okay
actually this is an example of a time
that I did actually allow a vendor to
influence the title but I have told that
story I've fully disclosed what happened
I'll I'll tell you guys as a reminder
and this I app player first look okay so
if you guys ever saw my unboxing of the
EMA site
key dragon I had I was joking in the
booth about calling it Razer wishes they
thought of this and our MSI contact was
like if you call it that I'll get you
the dragon and I was like heck yeah
brother
I was already I was already considering
doing it anyway so we were like yeah
let's do it alright so I think that's
pretty much it for this dream let's get
our hey look at that look at that
disclosure on there I actually had a lot
can fun playing with the guys with the
go XL are you guys can check it out at
the link in the video description it's
got a ton of great features as we
mentioned before it allows you to easily
like the software interface really is
intuitive remap all of your inputs and
outputs by splitting even individual
programs on your computer out as
separate inputs and then mapping them or
like just them or then plus other things
or other things and not them to all your
different outputs you can adjust your
faders to do whatever you want you can
play with play around with them in real
time
oh yeah they've got their convenient
little I can't really pick up this one
but they've got the convenient little
displays at the top so you can always
remember what each one of them is
assigned to they've got all the
different you know like effects that you
can apply to your voice if you're into
that sort of thing and of course you
know if you say something really funny
then you can recount it as many times as
you want funny funny funny funny you
know if you're into that sort of thing
did I mention already
hardware-accelerated not sure but that's
really important too it doesn't doesn't
suck up CPU cycles what's that
and it's the one-size-fits-all only
thing you need although of course you
know you could still get like a stream
deck or whatever like there's other cool
stuff
I just mean on like the audio side and
and Linus can do it themself thanks Jake
thank you for remembering to throw that
in Thank You Jake
Thank You Jake all right so thanks for
watching guys and we will see you in
like three hours on one show gonna
livestream some more today hopefully
hopefully this was fun informative
helpful it's gonna take me a little
while by the way as you guys can
see this is a pretty slow process but I
am committed to going back and adjusting
these titles so let's let's do better
especially moving forward even if I miss
a couple of the old ones I'm not gonna
like bad - bad we did - all right oh
yeah merge shadows he's lots of LTT
merge at the LTTE store calm guy I
wasn't really gonna do a standard outro
I was just gonna say bye to all the nice
people who watch the stream</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
