video blog where I'm going from my
iphone 4 to my HTC Windows Phone 8 8x
phone you can see I've got the shakes
now because I'm going through withdrawal
actually it hasn't been that it hasn't
been as bad as I thought probably my
biggest frustration has been there not
being an easy and convenient way to port
over all of my SMS messages although
speaking of SMS messages so we're gonna
we're gonna get right into this here so
so here we go typing a text message so
there's a couple cool things so number
one is that the keyboard suggestions are
pretty cool so if I go like this there's
a very good okay well it's a bad example
hella comes up before hello so how are
you doing today so it actually has a
fairly intelligent system for suggesting
what the next message that you might
want to send is this is also really cool
to actually you know I'm gonna go
through an order because I have notes so
it helps with punctuation which is cool
so check this out it put in his face for
me so if I did want to type rather than
selecting a word I could do that
but if I press period it'll actually
retract that space so the iPhone in my
experience hasn't really been that
intelligent about punctuation a lot of
time I have to make corrections so it's
it's nice to it's nice to have that done
for me there's no password to update
apps so updating apps was as simple as I
don't even remember it was really really
really simple and I have totally lost it
now it might have been in like settings
somewhere he was like I don't know
updates or something but the point is
that phone update I don't know maybe it
wasn't a phone update the point is
updates for simple all I have to do is
press the button it updates everything
autofill during typing predicts and - oh
yeah predicts entire words yep reminders
set with 1-minute granularity ok this
was something that I found to be a bit
of a challenge so if I want to add
things so I go okay what time you can
set times for things with one minute so
iOS is a bit of a bear to do this with
however I found that scrolling to
scrolling through this is a bit of a
challenge well it's not I mean it's not
a challenge obviously you can do it but
it takes longer than if you just had a
drop-down that was every five minutes I
think every five minutes would probably
be a good balance between being able to
select exactly the right time 12:17 p.m.
versus not being able to I find that
this little context you'll guy actually
does something sometimes but doesn't do
something other times in fact the
inconsistencies in the UI are a little
bit weird so sometimes confirm is
denoted with a check mark whereas other
times there we go whereas other times
there you go it's actually denoted with
a disk so normally I would expect any
kind of change commit to be the same
icon regardless of of where I am and for
that matter things like a confirmation
so here I'm going to go to Twitter
really quick so sometimes when you're
when you're typing something or whatever
else
sometimes the confirm is done through
enter whereas other times the confirm is
done through a button down here and so
those those little inconsistencies in
the UI can be a little bit can be a
little bit weird and can make it a
little bit a little bit distracting when
one app is different from another one
sometimes yep sometimes music okay music
navigation I wasn't that impressed with
so the first thing is that other than
going into the Xbox music app there
doesn't seem to be a quick way to get to
music if you had music open you can use
the multitasking key here to go to yeah
see it's gone now for some reason but so
so you can click the volume here and
that'll bring down a music navigation
display here if you have it open so
let's go ahead and find some song that
we're gonna play so now when I go out of
there you can see that navigations there
and I can switch between okay I would be
able to switch between songs except
again the the music navigation I'm
to be a bit a bit insufficient so
there's no seat look I pressed play
deposit just now or to play something
else or whatever's going on so do you
have to go to collection and then you
can't go to music and press play here to
just play all your songs if you play
these then you won't be able to change
it see and then if you go out here you
actually have to press play here to
start your whole collection going on
shuffle and then if you close down the
app in between that actually doesn't
take you back to the song that you're
releasing to before and will reshuffle
it so if that's what you wanted to do
then that'll work for you again I'm
pressing I'm pressing play because
that's the only button I have that that
that will do anything whereas if I go in
here then I can play and pause and start
and stop so I did find find new music
navigation to be a bit frustrating I
also discovered that the Xbox music app
is actually not available on anything
other than Windows 8 and I have not
upgraded my PC to Windows 8 yet I'm
waiting until I finish my personal rig
before I do that I'm getting a look from
slick right now but that means I have to
use the older Zune app and I haven't
actually installed it yet but maybe
that'll be in my sort of you know day 10
or day 15 or whenever I do my next
update so so that's where the
integration comes in I actually had a
coupon I don't know where it went for a
one-year subscription to Xbox music for
$100 or whatever it was and so I've
subscribed to that and that's really
cool because it means I can basically
ignore my collection oh yeah then
there's no convenient way to just sort
by songs so you can go music you can go
and it doesn't remember the way that you
prefer to sort so it'll take you to
artists every single time even though
that's not how I sort and I found I
found this really frustrating so I have
to actually go like this to get down to
a song that starts you know if I
remember it starts with you know M I
have to actually do this to go through
it there's no quick scroll like there is
on Android and iOS and you'd think that
this would be a dedicated search button
for sort of whatever app it is but it
always takes you to bing search
if you search for I don't know Hello
Kitty or something like that
hello Katya I got it and it doesn't auto
correct a lot of the time although it's
it's already adapting to my tendencies
so that's kind of cool so I can't quite
decide what I think of the predictive
text yet see this is another thing where
like I would think pressing search in a
search bar I'm students oh no no you
press ENTER for this okay it always
takes you to images and media first and
I don't know that there's a way to
change this to to search for web or I
mean either local or web search are more
logical that to me than media I don't
necessarily kitty I don't think that
that's necessarily the most natural
thing to to go with right so I wish the
search button was a dedicated search
button even when you're here it's gonna
search for some random thing on the
Internet you can use voice search which
is kind of neat I did try it it is quite
accurate notifications well oh yeah well
notifications don't move on their own
so if I click outside of this this just
kind of stays and it doesn't really go
away and that's a problem I have with
iOS as well like especially because I'm
a heavy Twitter user oh and the Twitter
app is just terrible for Windows set
phones out I'll get them Lerman the
Windows Phone II it I'll get into that
more later
so yeah it bothers me in iOS as well
because the notifications come down here
and a lot of the time I can't exit an
app until they go away and I'll have
tweets coming in so it'll be quite a
while off like try to do really really
accurate in tribes trying to close this
so this is not just a Windows Phone 8
thing brightness randomly boosts when
switching apps so for here I hold on its
want to make sure I don't have any
private conversations look anyway there
you go see Skype is super bright and now
it's dimmed again so that that's been
just kind of annoying when sort of it's
dark and speaking of brightness there's
only actually three settings for
brightness so I found even on iOS the
brightness options were not necessarily
enough for me and I used there's a
screen dimming app that you can use to
dim it even lower well this one has low
medium and high and then you can turn on
or off automatic adjustments and that's
pretty much it so I did find that a
little bit frustrating has a built-in QR
code reader
that seems to be an HTC addition and it
works extremely well it's one of the
faster ones I've experienced landscape
mode sometimes isn't graceful so for
example the tile UI completely doesn't
work in landscape mode at all and then a
funny thing about the phone is you
actually cannot turn off auto rotate so
the phone will always always always auto
rotate I have googled it it is a thing
you cannot turn it off so I'd love to
see them add this functionality because
when you're like lying in bed doing
something then it's nice to be able to
still use it in portrait mode if you're
reading a longer article or something
like that so I would appreciate that
here's a funny thing about the
autocorrect again so here we'll type
something - - diesel it autocorrect
doesn't help you compensate for a missed
space for example so if we said hello
oops how it's not gonna oh this is the
first time I've seen it do that okay
well there you go
I was wrong one thing that it doesn't do
is it won't compensate for okay
apparently I'm totally wrong about this
so maybe Hello is just a more common one
so there are some okay well I'm totally
wrong about that so the autocorrect is
better than I thought it was it looks
like it's just kind of missing things
from time to time because it's only when
I see it but I kind of go oh it didn't
catch that hmm okay one thing it
definitely doesn't do is what I've seen
iOS do is here so let's go with a word
like okay who've where I accidentally
put in a space it does not suggest
who've to me whereas I have seen that
done in iOS but I don't have much
experience with Android on that one so
and I mean all of this is just sort of
my experience with it so don't take it
as sort of the gospel truth the only way
autocorrected gotta practice it
autocorrect is kind of cool it's cool if
you don't type
that fast but as soon as as soon as you
want to speed up it doesn't really see
it's not really suggesting anything fast
enough for me to actually use it so so
that was something that I observed was
that it was useful if you're slow but if
you're not then it's not that useful
however those of you who are really fast
on the keyboard or probably not gonna
have that much trouble with in any way I
wouldn't have minded a more square
keyboard and I wish you could change the
keyboard one thing that I found from my
first blog that is not as bad as I
thought it was was the underscore you
don't have to do this to access it you
can with kick away
holy okay you can just go like this so
you can switch between your special
characters this way
so it's actually really not that bad
that's quite fast now typing kept again
accurate sensor is accurate and handy I
yes okay so when you're trying to
highlight something accurately it takes
quite a while to pop up the cursor but
the cursor is quite accurate the one
time I did have an issue with it was
when I was trying to get it over to the
very far left all those can be an issue
with sort of any phones sometimes
getting accurate sensitivity right near
the edges of the screen so I had trouble
selecting the first letter when I was
typing over at the very far left the
only thing I don't like about it is how
long it takes to pop up so it just feels
whoops it just feels a little bit on the
slower side and because it doesn't pop
itself right under your thumb so I mean
I like Android because with Android if
you're in accurate enough toucher then
you just touch the spot and it actually
just goes there whereas iOS you have to
hold it down and then it gives you that
little magnifying glass but at least
it's still under your finger with this
one you go okay I want to put it here
see how it's up there now no matter what
I'm gonna have to move so if I was close
enough in the first place with iOS then
I don't have to move once I see the
pop-up this time I have to move no
matter what on Windows Phone 8 I find
I'm less accurate on the keyboard I
think part of that is just my small
hands like I actually have significant
amount of trouble reaching the Q and now
I've gone to impressed the camera button
sorry about that
so I find I'm less accurate if I hold it
two-handed or if I hold it in with one
hand and type with
other hand I don't have I don't have
trouble with that ah music yep okay yep
yep yep okay yeah the other thing about
the music cap is where's my now playing
list exactly okay go to music and it
lets me sort of navigate albums songs
playlist I don't have playlist why would
I need playlists
there's your history there's new stuff
there's apps there's music stores music
stores cool when you have a subscription
cuz you can basically just go okay let's
play this and it's sort of
all-you-can-eat which for a hundred
dollars a year actually really isn't
that unreasonable
compared to actually paying for the
songs individually I mean that's 100
songs it's just like five albums it's
really not that much there's no battery
life percentage on the top so I haven't
found a way to turn that on yet I do
like to know exactly how much battery
life is left because I find those can be
sometimes not that accurate again I'm
pressing play to pause or I can do this
or I can do that there we go
very limited screen brightness settings
I think I showed that contact scrolling
yeah same thing in contact so I'm not
going to show you guys my contact list
in too much detail here but let me just
go through here
and sort of I'll show you so it's the
same thing where you actually can't you
can't scroll by by names like that they
want you to search so if I were to
search for hold on so there's a you
can't use a search button here you want
to use the search button here I wish
again that this was a search button the
contextual search button as opposed to
just a regular search button so I can't
scroll here but if I search for
something like a Q Tech mechanic so
searching works but it's just it's it's
frustrating it's not that yeah it's just
not that intuitive dialing is dialing is
good though I really like the way the
actual phone interface itself works so
you know eight eight eight eight eight
eight
and I call something gives you a bunch
of cool options mute speaker put your
thing on there don't put your thing on
there so all of that worked really
really well ah SMS app oh yeah the SMS
app so this is this kind of neat hold on
again I don't want to show sort of
everyone in there dogs names but I check
this out so you can actually use this
right here too okay you have to okay if
you have someone entered as a contact in
multiple ways
so here I'll find slick here nope you I
don't okay well whatever I'll just have
to describe it so if you have someone
entered in multiple ways in your here we
go so yeah that'll do so this is cool
within the SMS app you can use this
little switch button right here to go oh
I want to send an SMS this time oh I
want to send an MSN Messenger message
this time whatever it is you want to do
but one thing is that until you sort of
wrap your mind around that you've got to
remember what kind of message you're
sending because I sent some messages to
someone to their Facebook and then what
I actually wanted to send was an SMS cuz
I don't even have facebook on their
phone and so it didn't get to them so
you just have to kind of get used to
that but I thought that was really
really cool we're getting pretty close
to the end here pretty close to the end
iMessage I had a couple people call me
out cuz I said I had to use my iPhone 4
for something and going back to the
small screen was really hard like this
thing feels like a toy now compared to
the 8x which as you guys can see with my
iPhone size comparison is significantly
bigger both in terms of screen size and
in terms of just overall size so this
thing's like you know felt like I felt
like yeah I felt like a child's
plaything but I had to go back to it
because I had to turn off iMessage so if
you just sort of throw your iPhone away
and started chuck it and you leave
iMessage on and it's sort of somewhere
what will happen is some of your SMS
messages will automatically go to your
iPhone using data instead of SMS so I
had someone sending me messages and they
actually went to my iPhone not to the
phone that actually had my sim card in
it so that was sort of annoying oops my
bad and you know what I think that's
pretty much it for now
overall snappiness
good I like being able to you know pin
things I've started creating some tiles
I did find a good substitute for air
video so cloud media is actually working
really really well now that I've got all
the ports set up right and all that good
stuff so you know there you go you can
play back things pretty quickly in much
the same way that that our video works
so auto-rotate always works because yeah
it you can't turn it off so that's just
playing off of off of a server so it's
just an app you run on a server computer
that that you know transcodes on the fly
and sunbeams it to your phone just like
our video on iOS let me just see if
there's anything else that I'm
forgetting right now this seems pretty
detailed so far found a couple games
that I like already right so all the
games are instead of actually having
dedicated tiles for each game you just
kind of go through here and you can pin
things to the place where you like them
the most sort of within the games thing
that actually works quite well for me so
this is a ragdoll run which I find
pretty fun and I think that's what we're
gonna close off with here so stay tuned
for my next Windows 8 Windows 8 phone
I switched blogg I'm doing as you guys
as I said last time I'm doing a 30-day
trial where I'm going to stay with
Windows Phone 8 no matter what and then
at the end I'm going to decide if I'm
going to go back to iOS or if I'm going
to stick with Windows Phone 8 and for
those of you who are bound to ask I am
NOT going to Android I don't like
Android please stop asking me if I'm
going to Android because I'm not don't
