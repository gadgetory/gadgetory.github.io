sending us the sample that we're going
to have a look at today today I have and
you won't be able to tell from the front
because this uses thermal rights
trademark plain brown box packaging
thermalright has always kind of said
well we're not really about the blocks
were more about the what's inside the
box so here we've got just simple text
on the side this is their Spitfire vga
cooler and i've also got one of their
vrm are five accessories for it so why
don't we start with let's start with the
add-on piece just to kind of shake
things up you know why look at the main
thing when we're actually you know
looking at both in the long run or
something first of all we get a thermal
right ultimate cooling solution sticker
inside the box and we're probably going
to have one of those in each box would
be my guess okay then we get a quick
assembly package so this gives you what
what accessories you can accept or you
can expect in order to assemble your VR
mr5 now as you might have already
guessed the vrm r 5 is for cooling the
vrm on a radeon 5 series so this is for
the radeon 5870 and you can see that
we've got a quick exploded view of how
to install it it actually looks really
simple so you've got a couple clips that
appear to be for fans and then you've
got a couple of screws that go in from
the back and yeah that's fairly
straightforward thanks for that ok why
don't we have a look at the actual
cooler itself okay it starts to look
less simple all of a sudden here today
that's ok we'll get into that one when
we get to it so I'm not gonna snap this
open now because it looks actually quite
well sealed and there's a bunch of
little parts in here but we've got as
they outlined here three thumbscrews
three washers and then to thermal strips
ok and let's have a look at the cooler
itself because this is sort of the
business part of thermal rates business
is coolers that is a big piece of foam
huh why don't we unbox the phone today
just the phone so what they've done is
they put together some foam and then
remain a hole in it and that now I'm
just kidding that protects the cooler
itself so this is the vrm are five
and this is actually yeah this is kind
of amazing because this piece is
dedicated purely to cooling the voltage
regulators I mean when you consider how
small and puny the cooler that sits on
the vrm on a stock card is and you think
that this is actually designed to cool
that this this whole thing it's so it's
pretty cool so here let's have a look at
the menu at the at the diagram they've
done here so when you've actually got
your card installed in your system this
is going to stick up this way so any
case airflow that's coming to your case
generally speaking it's going to be
coming front to back is going to have to
blow through these fins in order to be
exhausted so that's what thermalright is
going for with their design so why don't
we have a look at the actual Spitfire
and then we will go from there into what
it'll kind of look like you know i wish
i had a 5870 to show it to you with but
um I don't you know what maybe we'll
spend a little bit more time on this guy
first okay so they're using
nickel-plated nickel-plated fins here
and they've got a couple of
nickel-plated copper heatpipes that are
running one from like right under one of
the contact strips here and then the
other one is a little bit to the side of
the other contacts trip you can see it
right here but be based on the fact that
you're going to have excellent heat
transfer from from one part of an
aluminum structure to another part these
blue heat pipes are both going to be
able to carry a lot of heat up to these
fins here so okay that pretty much
covers it okay let's have a look at the
Spitfire itself so we got another
sticker and then we get another assembly
package so you can see there are a lot
more parts included with this one so why
don't we why don't we keep that on scan
by and then what I'll do is I'll show
you each of the included parts as we go
through it so installation manual okay
installation of the support bars oh
that's interesting okay so thermalright
has actually included support bars
because they're afraid that this that
this heat sink is going to make well not
they're afraid but rather their concern
for their end users that installing this
might make it so that their video card
becomes quite heavy so you can see how
it is once it's actually installed on a
video card so they have provided with
the cooler a way to actually brace it
against a couple of the standoffs that
your motherboard screws into your
chassis with so by extension what you're
doing this is actually pretty cool is
you are bracing this cooler against your
chassis so if you're actually needing to
move your computer while you have the
Spitfire installed here I had you
looking at that tiny picture there you
go so during installation at the
supporting rod is blocked by any of the
components you have a metal rod install
the new tank mounting holes so cool
they've included a couple sort of extra
ways for you to make sure that you can
install this that is terrific okay
moving on here is the installation guide
so here's the exploded view where they
show you oh here's the step by step on
the back so you insert the multiple Fred
let me pull this out so we can at least
have a look at the included accessories
first ok that is a big pile of
accessories so this is the assembly
package we're going to see if I can get
this open finally here don't you think
too much of a mess yeah I'm gonna pull
the old pen trick ok there we go so the
biggest thing in here is the support
bars and those are what their maiden
because my guest is going to be like
steel or something like that because it
have to be quite strong so here they are
those our needs so they've got a groove
in them so you can actually adjust them
depending on exactly where you want to
put the yeah yeah that's interesting so
you use this one side and then that
screws into the top of the Spitfire and
then this side just kind of adjusts to
wherever you need to fasten it so that's
very cool so those are the support bars
next we have fan mounts so you've got
your standard wire clip fan mounts next
we have two more pieces of the support
bar structures so these can be used to
screw into the motherboard standoff
holes and then you can actually attach
the Spitfire itself to
these okay next we have all of the
mounting hardware that we need in order
to install the Spitfire onto the card so
let me see what we've got here all these
thumb screws hmm you know I've never
actually tried to figure out vga cooler
mounting on camera and it is proving to
be quite difficult so I might not get
too much further into the mounting
unless I do a dedicated video to me
about mounting this particular cooler so
why don't we just have a look at all the
other accessories that are included so
you got your mounting plates and then
you've also got some included thermal
compound and then you've also got little
heat sinks for the RAM as well as for
the sum of the voltage regulation
modules on the back so I guess if you
don't have this particular accessory you
can also use this so ran heatsink a ram
heatsink be and then what are the other
ones these six pieces are 7 p-7 Ram
heatsink SI ohno so they are all for ram
so you do need the vrm cooling accessory
so let's have a look at the Spitfire wow
this thing's as big as a cpu cooler
that's the first thing I notice about it
it's got six key types so here I'll get
the cameramen to get in close to this
thing and have a look first let's get
all of the phonies taken off of it oh it
looks like these these either stay on or
no no these come out ok so these phonies
also come out and wow the structure this
thing is actually quite quite unique so
there's a lot of separation in between
the dedicated fins to each one of these
heat pipes and then they've got one
solid appears to be steel plate at the
top holding it all in place so that none
of them are going to move from there
from their normal structure so as you'd
expect from a thermal right product the
bottom is based at the bottom base the
base is lat very smooth and then you've
got six heat pipes all terminated right
here so you can actually mount this and
you can see that this base is lapped as
well you can either mount it to your
graphics card this way and then you've
got your GPU making contact here or you
can mount it to your graphics card
this way and you've got your GPU making
contact to this side so that's pretty
cool and that's one of the reasons that
thermalright wouldn't have been able to
do a heat pipe direct touch design
because they wanted to make sure that
you have that flexibility because I mean
face it this thing is huge it's not
going to fit just any old way in every
case in the world so why don't we have a
look at where the heat pipes all make
contact so you can see these are welded
or rather soldered in and then they each
come out to a dedicated fin arrangement
when these fins are actually pretty
unique because normally you can kind of
see right through the fins on a cooler
but they've got these um what they've
done is they've taken each Finn and
they've actually bent they've been 'tom
so that you get more surface area per
fan blowing down on it although it would
make it more restrictive now why they
would have made a design decision like
that I'm not sure but I think the
results for this cooler speak for itself
I've seen it installed on radeon 5870 s
and it's dropped temperatures by over 30
degrees over the stock cooler without
even running an extreme fan on it so
thermalright actually had a recommended
fan that they sent to me as well and I'm
hoping I'll be able to do an
installation video but it's the
excellent 140 so it can accept up to a
100 40 millimeter fan anyway thank you
for checking out my unboxing and first
look at the thermal right Spitfire as
well as their vrm cooling accessory for
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
