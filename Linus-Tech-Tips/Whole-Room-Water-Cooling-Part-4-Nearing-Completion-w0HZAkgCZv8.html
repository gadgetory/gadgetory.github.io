like walk racing a good waiter says he
said it this is Donna Poulos Spencer
from Teheran iron Canada from the
mirrored Caturday you told us this is a
whole room water cooling project through
my slight dip was crazy day for day four
this was not supposed to take four days
so what's the plan
okay the plan is to get these fittings
stop leaking first so I have come armed
with the uber wrench just kind of like
the Cooper Mitch
but wrench this one is almost big enough
for this we're not quite but that's okay
because I have an even newer edge what a
Flemish crack
please Anarkali this time yeah you're
dreamin should have carried one of these
it's a lot heavier than a crowbar ah hi
script
yeah
the compression for me they're good so
we're doing a bit of a longer tubing run
this time so that we can make sure that
the pump is nice and below the reservoir
they're like a better way to say ah yeah
Logan never flow here you don't have one
more anything it go from theory
period should work and still this tablet
okay at stop
that's not leaking
so at this point we're testing the loop
to find out if this whole thing is
actually even working and even though it
would have been wiser to do this before
we hooked everything up to the whole
room I'm actually testing to make sure
that each of the individual systems is
not leaking so checking fittings
checking blocks everything looks to be
okay but if a leak were to be sprung at
this point it would be pretty crummy
with the systems powered on it looked
like everything was working fine CPU
temperatures look normal I could see
water within the blocks but then
temperatures started to creep up on some
of the PCs and not others and then they
would go up up up up up and then they'd
settle right back down to what looks
like a normal water-cooled
idle temperature so not having a whole
lot of time to figure out what the
problem was I had to do a little bit of
running around diagnosing what exactly
is going on with G's CPU temps so the
issue ended up being that some of the
systems were getting some water flow and
others weren't due to air bubbles being
stuck in some of the pipes and not
others and essentially while our pump
not having not head pressure because we
were actually getting reasonable flow
out of the system once we got the whole
thing filled but not a high enough flow
rate in order to get the water moving
fast enough in order to force the
bubbles down the down side of their
tubes through the systems and then back
up the other side into our reservoir
okay the Pew temps at 28 degrees not
rising
oh that Punk just grabbed and here all
the air bubbles going okay
when it's not air bubbles stuck in it it
spins but not very definitely a blogger
pension
series
so you're 12
the whole thing we'll fly it down once
the air bleeds oh here we go
I'd seriously
okay let's get some good job shall we
alright you know where they are probably
in Arles
pick them up and gave me two is that is
what you did hide it now okay okay
alright okay let's do this
this is Linus because it as Ellie know
what is problem because the first time
we bled the loop on every one of these
we connected them so right now it's
going to be really hard to believe the
system because these ones that were not
using have no water flow rate is going
down the drains at like again
okay it's not so bad you just have to do
what one two three right okay okay don't
forget your system phones so you're
ready to go when the time comes
ah I wish we'd planned for a more
graceful way to do that and I have that
rag right Heather
yeah so what we have to do is what do we
have to do just put them officer then
zone them
yeah compression fittings from okay yeah
it's compression fittings
I'll take here connect it to the pipe so
what do you do now do you put the
compression fitting on before you attach
it to the wall yeah use that which one
this thing
cool idea to get this thing closer that
yeah click on the tubing right here I
guess I could wrap this plug as low as
it can be and I want this Reds tilted a
little bit are you ready
all right hit it for the third time
well they're not enough - something
needs to push the air through this and
that's supposed to be that one but that
one needs a lot more pressure in order
to make that happen
so you can see that this is getting even
without all the other systems connected
it's getting like those low at all
what's different now I'm not really
getting any backup yeah we're not really
getting any appreciable flow in here
though that
it's kind of bizarre there'd be a
blockage
tense now
yeah
seven-six
I
oh it's flowing now
you
it's elite the big tubes empty now yeah
that's terrific
good to see ty yeah we got a plan show -
you don't want the opposite eeeh the
show where you're the first first time
you're on to be terrible right I can
come up with opinions on the slide what
kind of know about that my deal
if I do anyways
all right that's good
making the bubbles my bitch
another one your way
oops got too enthusiastic about my
bubble slaying and with the bubbles out
comes to help us but with the bubbles in
there they can't do anything
alrighty then zero tears didn't
the coolermaster neptune 240m features
an exclusive pump design and their new
Silencio fans to provide impressive near
silent performance click now to learn
more again
Wow is there even room for that power
supply should be - fortunately these
cables are inter compatible so we
actually only have to swap out the power
supply so that's it for the summer
portion of this project we actually did
not finish it at all we got distracted
with a bunch of other things I mean it
isn't finished in that it works some
parts of it but we're going to have at
least one more update here with the
finishing touches as well as the final
result so stay tuned for that
