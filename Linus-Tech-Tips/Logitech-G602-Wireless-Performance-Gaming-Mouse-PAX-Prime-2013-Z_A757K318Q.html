brought to you by Western Digital Intel
and SteelSeries so we're here with Todd
Walker the brand manager for a Logitech
G Series so that is their gaming
peripherals for those of you who have
been living under a rock for the last
you know decade or so and they've got a
new Mouse that pretty much takes the
rock and moves it and digs up all the
earth and completely turns everything on
its head because this right here is the
G 602 and it's nothing like the G 600
and really anything else we've ever seen
before can you tell us what are the key
innovations that you've brought to the
table with this mouse so the big thing
with the 602 is battery life so it's a
new wireless mouse in our line it does
not replace the 700s we still be at the
700 s in our line as a rechargeable
gaming mouse the 602 is a wireless
gaming mouse that has 250 hours of
non-stop gaming battery life dental
you've got a you've got a custom
proprietary battery pack in there can
you show me that show we're showing that
special battery pack that you use that's
a special double a two double-a Duracell
battery pack standard fascinating and so
I mean what can you do to optimize the
power of a mouse because when you when
you think a little power you think eco
you think like if I told you it's an eco
car you'd go oh well then it's not very
fast what have you done to make this
perform well and be eco yeah so this the
sensor you're right that we put all of
our emphasis into the sensor which is
what draws most of the power in a gaming
in a wireless mouse but we didn't skimp
on it in the performance so it has a
sensor that's very similar to what you
have in the 100's or the 400s very very
accurate very precise it does have a 250
dpi sensor in there did you mean 2500 oh
sorry yeah 2500 250 to 2500 that's the
range thank you for correcting me and a
lot of the emphasis has been into the
power management on the sensor so when
it's in performance mode you get full
full capabilities out of the mouse eye
and that's where you get the 250 hours
of battery life and then in endurance
mode when you're using it for non gaming
purposes it actually will do a lot more
of turning the sensor on and off and
watch waiting how the power is used and
you get up to 1,400 hours of usage with
it now this to me it looks not quite
like the G 600 where you can really look
at it and you go yeah that's an MMO
Mouse this to me looks like it's more of
a more of a tweener where it could be
used for MMO use or fps use can you show
us all the buttons and tell us about the
default bindings on the mouse sure so it
has 11 controls on it when we announced
this earlier in the week there are a lot
of people who are actually saying they
did want to use it for MMOs that 20
buttons was just maybe a little too much
for them we have six buttons on the
thumb panel here and one of those is for
mode indicators as the default I also
have two buttons here that are dpi shift
up and down got on the fly up to 5
settings and then of course we've got
primary keys on the the switches our one
underneath the scroll wheel so that's 11
in all and there's endurance mode which
I mean are you realistically expect with
I mean if someone can game for 250 hours
non-stop is there a realistic reason why
a gamer would even use endurance mode
that much there may be people who want
to really extend the life of the
batteries but you know a lot of us have
been using prototypes for a couple of
months and we've been in performance
mode the whole time and haven't actually
gotten to the end of a battery set of
batteries yet speaking of getting to the
end of a set of batteries I think a big
a big a big problem for gamers is often
swapping batteries in and out can you
show us sort of how quickly you could
swap a battery in and out of this bad
boy
sure I'm not another set of batteries
but it's very very easy to just pop that
that out batteries out hold on hold on
this is why I wanted you to do this
you've got one battery in there can the
mouse up oh no oh oh what happens it
keeps running right so the sensor
requires so little power that I can
actually just put one battery in there
and I'm just fine so I just take take
one battery out and we're ready to go
now this isn't necessarily sorry I was
kind of joking with them about well you
could swap warnings well better another
one that's not really the point but the
point from my perspective is you look at
it you go but if you don't want the
weight of two double-a batteries it's
not a particularly heavy Mouse to start
with but if you want it to lighten it
a little bit you can actually run it
with one battery and you're still
looking at 125 hours of continuous
gaming now when you benchmark that you
mean like on a basis of sort of a
normalized well with someone game for
four hours a day then it would last
approximately this many hours how are
you benchmarking it now so we do a run
to die test and that's how we benchmark
the 250 hours so we basically put on a
test bed that activates the sensor
continuously put a fresh set of
batteries in and then we wait until the
batteries are dead so you mentioned the
world record for gaming continuously
with how many hours it's like about a
hundred forty three hours straight so
that a gentleman would not necessarily
be able to make do with just one battery
probably have to put both of them in
then yeah if you want to go for Guinness
World you need both batteries everyone
else should be ok though you know this
is fantastic you've also got your mouse
pad you want to give us a very brief run
through that before we move on yeah sure
so the one that we have here is the G
440 this is a hard gaming mouse pad it's
semi rigid polymer core this is really
designed for people who do a high
sensitivity gaming it has a very low
friction surface which you can see kind
of runs like an air hockey table against
the mouse mouse feet the the 440 and the
240 which is a cloth flexible mousepad
that's more for low low dpi gaming low
sensitivity mean both of them have been
tested to work across the entire line of
logitech gaming mice they actually
improve the performance of what are
already great accuracy and precision and
regardless of whether using optical
sensors or laser sensors either one of
them is great for those mice this has
been fantastic thank you very much Todd
and enjoy the rest of the show you too</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
