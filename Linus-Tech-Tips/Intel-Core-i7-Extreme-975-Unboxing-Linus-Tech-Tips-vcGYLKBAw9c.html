this is an LG 8 1366 core i7 so it's the
old core i7 with three channels for
memory and with hyper-threading ok so it
is an i7 975 this is an extreme edition
processor I'm just gonna have a look ok
so you got a hyper threading turbo boost
blah blah blah 3-year warranty all that
good stuff you got your standard fare
here so let's break the seal on this
baby
Oh first of all you've got a little
window here where you can actually see
the CPU mine seems to be dislodged a
little bit in there but well we'll get
it open and find out why exactly that is
so we're breaking the factory seal here
oh that's a pretty good sticker there we
go
ok so let's open this up and find out
exactly what we get with the Intel Core
i7 Extreme Edition so first of all we
get a plastic clamshell oh no here we go
there is a manual so here's your manual
this includes your installation
instructions your three year limited
warranty information as well as an Intel
Inside logo label on the back panel so
here's all your installation
instructions all that good stuff all
your warranty info and there is your
core i7 extreme sticker that you can put
on your case because yeah that's an
expensive sticker and you're gonna want
to show it off next thing it is the core
i7 Xtreme itself so this is a nine seven
five so that means it is a d0 stepping
processor all of the nine seven 5s are
you can see that on the bottom of the
chip itself you've got 1366 pads that
make contact with the pins on your x58
motherboard because x58 is the only
chips that that supports these extreme
edition chips at this time and then we
also have a core r7 xtreme 1366 CPU
heatsink so it's a little bit different
from the standard one in that instead of
being just an aluminum flower heatsink
it's actually an aluminum and copper one
it has a blue LED fan on the top it's a
four pin PWM fan header and then you've
got two different speed settings so you
can either set it
high or too low depending on how much
noise and how much cooling you want to
get out of it that said if you're buying
an extreme edition processor you should
probably be buying an aftermarket cooler
so you can get the most out of it anyway
because the best thing about an extreme
edition is the unlocked multiplier which
makes for better easier overclocking
