setup going on so thing that I got going
on so here I have seven Seagate
Barracuda 3 terabyte desktop drives and
I have one Samsung 512 gig 830 series
SSD so what I'm going to be doing with
these is I have a new raid card here
from Adaptec this is their 6800 5tq so
it includes a super capacitor or
whatever it is they call it basically
it's it's kind of like a battery backup
in that it will allow anything that is
cached to be written but it is not an
actual battery so it's a slightly
different technology one thing to be
careful of with these things is you
don't want to plug them in or unplug
them when they are charged they ship
discharge so you can plug them in before
you install it but just be aware of that
you can mess stuff up so there's the
raid card there this supports adapt x
max cache 2.0 so the difference between
max cache and max cache 2.0 is that max
cache 2.0 supports random SSDs
it also supports much larger SSDs and
consumer technologies like Intel SRT so
I want to take this massive raid array
I'm going to do the whole thing and raid
0 striped so that means there will be no
fault tolerance but we will be getting
pretty much as much performance as you
can get from a single single raid card
with a reasonable number of gods I mean
even this number of guys is kind of
unreasonable so this 512 gig cash will
be cashing 21 terabytes of mechanical
storage I want to test this we're going
to have an upcoming NCIX tech tips on
this I want to test this against some
sort of more modern configurations to
see what we can potentially do with the
future of storage compared to a single
SSD today a single hard drive today or a
hybrid solution like a momentous XT
today so here I'm configuring my mash
max cache SSD caching so I've added one
SSD to the pool you can obviously add as
many SS
as you want to well no I think it's
actually got a limit whatever it's done
now so here you can see my finished
configuration I've got my raid zero set
up with my hat raid zero cache with
nineteen plus terabyte so it's 21
terabytes depending on how you measure
it on focus please wait 0 okay and then
I've got my SSD set up as a cache so I
am ready to run some performance min
performance benchmark so I'm going to be
using PC mark and doing several runs
because I'm going to be comparing it
against some other configurations to see
how it then how it's how it performs at
first and then how performs in
subsequent runs with the caching enabled
as the controller learns so stay tuned
for the NCIX tech tips on that and
thanks for checking out this
configuration process for Mac's cache
2.0 so the 8 drives hooked up to the
Adaptec controller or these 8 these 8
right here are in raid 6 on the arica
controller and I might as well benchmark
that while we're at it just for
comparison and then these two are just a
raid 1 for the OS backup for Windows
Home Server so don't forget to subscribe
- tech tips from unboxings reviews and
other computer videos oh actually here's
one more thing guys sorry as I'm getting
into my benchmarking here I noticed
something cool so that is that it
actually gives you a readout of the the
overall usage of your raid array which
is very cool so I can actually monitor
how much the SSD cache is affecting how
things go in fact there's the DRAM
statistics i/o and max cache statistics
right there very cool stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
