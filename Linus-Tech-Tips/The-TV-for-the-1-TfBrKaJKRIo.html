up we go oh wow hardly weighs anything
seventy seven inch TV and it's about
twelve kilos twenty-seven freedom units
watch this we're going around this
corner here being seven millimeters
thick does come with some drawbacks all
right so see back here you've got the
hook there that goes on these little
knobby screws that we've got the kind of
washer things it's kind of tough to get
it aligned here because you can't so
tight to the wall you can't really see
no I missed I'm on let's go up yeah I
think you got it we good okay check this
out so the rest of it just clips on with
magnets so that's it
the w8 this is the best TV LG makes
should get one you know just uh 15 grand
15 grand yeah I know right it's a good
thing LG sent this thing ready to fire
it up and we're going to but not until
this message from Mac Weldon Mac Weldon
makes great t-shirts socks wallets and
more they believe in simple shopping and
if you use code tech tips you'll get 20
percent off your order at the link below
to get things kicked off we hooked up
our Xbox one and through in Planet Earth
to on 4k blu-ray as predicted it is
stunning
you got 4k all sorts of HDR support
pretty much everything that you'd expect
for 15 grand to the point that you guys
probably aren't even looking at me right
now you're probably looking at that so
then that's it in a video right this TV
is great well no because it has some
problems it's also out of reach for
almost all of us but the good news is
you don't actually have to spend that
much in order to get the same picture
quality dropping down 12 inches to the
65 inch model cuts the price more than
50% to a mere 7 grand which okay is
still getting dangerously close to a
chair of college tuition but if you
don't need the wallpaper thinness this
exact same panel is used across LG's
entire OLED lineup and the only thing
that differentiates the various price
points is how fancy of a body style you
want except for the very cheapest one
the b8 which uses a lower tier processor
but is that a big deal anyway
like the other 2018 models the b8 still
has support for Google assistant and a
relatively obscure foot appreciated
black frame insertion feature to help
reduce shutter which means that all it
lacks are the benefits of LG's flagship
alpha 9 processor it's quad pass image
processing to reduce banding it's AI
object recognition to help increase
depth and sharpness and its frame
interpolation technique to simulate 120
Hertz refresh rate not necessarily
things that matter to everyone though if
they matter to you I mean it's 200 bucks
more to bump up to the Alpha 9 equipped
C 8 man these guys love their letters
and numbers don't think speaking of an
extra $200 if you're a real stickler for
accurate color then be prepared to shell
out some more to have your screen
professionally calibrated because out of
the box
even with the Technicolor expert mode
turned on our particular panel didn't
have great color accuracy particularly
with the primary pigment cyan magenta
and yellow it's actually quite a bit
worse than what we measured on LG's own
$2,400 LCD TV just a couple of weeks ago
we're not saying it's terrible I mean
the average best buy shopper would
notice but it's pretty bothersome to me
that at this price you still need to
toss an extra 250 bucks to Geek Squad to
get it calibrated now the good news is
that we measured almost 94 percent
coverage of the DCI p3 color space so
exceptional color reproduction is
achievable on these TVs now comparing
the w8 to Samsung's q9f the nicest TV
that they make you can see that they're
both amazing displays but even with full
array local dimming the quantum dot LCD
display just cannot achieve the sharp
contrast of an OLED check out the halo
around the white letters but when you
make a super high-end product you
inevitably open yourself up to some
scrutiny and there are still some gripes
some of which were present in the w7 and
still persist with this year's model
mostly having to do with the TV's
mandatory sound bar the reason this TV
is so thin other than the fact that it's
OLED and therefore it doesn't have a fat
back light shining through the pixels is
because the TVs drive circuitry power
supply and i/o are not housed in the
main chassis but are instead contained
in this 28 pound Dolby Atmos sound bar
now to be clear it's a pretty awesome
sound bar it's 4.2 channel and 60 watts
so it goes pretty loud and usually
manages to sound clear at high volumes
unless you're listening to metal or
something and the way the speakers
emerge and then hide when you turn the
TV off is really slick by if you're the
type of person who spends $15,000 on a
TV we don't think it's that much of a
stretch to say that you probably have a
better audio solution than what they're
including here
a fact that is demonstrated by the
number of wallpaper TV owners who have
opted to hide their sound bars under a
table or in a wall behind the screen
wouldn't it be easier more aesthetic and
even cheaper for everyone involved
if LG simply offered a more compact
variant that didn't include any speakers
at all I mean it's the kind of thing
that's so obvious and it makes you kind
of mad because it's like it feels like
they're saying hey I mean these high-end
clients are already paying so much
what's an extra few hundred bucks to
cover the cost of a sound bar not to
mention the shipping but even if they do
make the sound bar easier to hide the
umbilical cord is still kind of a drag
even though it is relatively discreet
and includes an extension it's just not
nearly as flexible as Samsung's one
connect solution and it doesn't have the
requisite fire rating to be run inside a
wall so depending on your local laws you
might need one of these sold separately
in wall cable kits and finally what
about ol Ed's arch-nemesis not being as
brightest quantum dot and burnin well
it's still not as bright but I think
we're far past the point where we left
off with plasma where they were
considered only suitable for use in a
dimmed room I personally didn't find
that it was an issue with the w8 at all
as for burnin while mitigation
strategies like screen shift which moves
the whole picture over a few pixels
periodically the automatic screen saver
and the pixel refresher routines that
run to help prevent image retention
exists
burnin continues to be an issue on
modern ole Ed's one that will especially
affect people like gamers which is kind
of why we didn't really mention it's
awful input lag and my grandma who
leaves local news and The Weather
Channel on 24 hours a day I mean I've
been using mine for two years and I
haven't experienced it yet so there's no
doubt in my mind that with proper care
which by the way for me includes nagging
my wife and kids to make sure that they
have YouTube and Netflix in full screen
mode so I don't end up with a stupid
Windows Start icon in the bottom left
LG's 2018 lineup of O LEDs will drop the
jaw of pretty much anyone within eyeshot
for years to come though that doesn't
mean that you should necessarily buy
this particular one I mean if you got a
billion dollars in the bank yeah duh why
not buy by nine you know buy some Quadro
GPUs and run the whole thing as a giant
video wall who cares it's one of the
coolest TVs on the planet but if I was a
more normal person I would first make
sure that I have a secondary display for
those extra innings ballgames then I'd
probably look elsewhere in LG's OLED
lineup or if virtual assistant
integration and fancy processing aren't
significant value ads for you then a
discounted w7 from last year might also
be a good bet since the panel quality
will be identical FreshBooks is the
