biggest trips of the year for people in
the tech space so what better way to
kick it off than to show you guys the
tools we use to cover it ton away lets
you toggle it 16 different countries
allowing you to browse the internet and
use online services as if you're in a
different country click now to learn
more starting off with our biggest
change for our show coverage the cameras
we are using for CES we are using to a7s
mark 2's which I did a full review of
here as well as the recently released
Sony FS 5 the reason we decided to go
with the mark twos is because of their
superb low-light performance thanks to
Sony's fantastically engineered
full-frame sensor when it comes to shows
like CES packs or Computex lighting
situations are varied and there is ZERO
certainty to the situation you will be
in the mark 2 gives us the peace of mind
that no matter where we end up we will
be able to get the shots we need to
complete our videos moving on to audio
we have two sony k1m modules for our a7
s mark 2's which gives us a solid audio
solution without adding too much bulk to
the overall setup each mark 2 is also
fitted with its own cage to mount the
module off to one side leaving room for
other accessories to be attached for our
actual mic solutions we have two sets of
Sennheiser's a VX system which i did a
full review of here the a VX for us has
been an easy set up lightweight solution
which is well suited for shows since the
receiver does not require any other
mounting besides being put into the
modules XLR port within the AV x system
will be using their standard hammer mics
as well as a couple of wired hammer mics
as backups for stabilization we have my
usual Manfrotto mvh 500 monopod with our
new addition being cyclers a CL carbon
fiber tripod which is a very lightweight
and sturdy set of sticks that will not
be a burden to carry around on the show
for lastly it insisted that he bring his
men photo tripod which he'll be using in
a rather interesting way with a flagpole
strapped on his waist for ease of
mobility lens choice was a fairly simple
one since we wanted maximum versatility
for the show floor we went with two
Canon 24 to 105 millimeter f/4 lenses
and thanks to the a7 s Mark twos
low-light prowess using an f4
should be fairly reasonable in the
environments we will be shooting in for
the fs5 we chose to go with one of my
favorite zoom lenses the Tama on 24 to
70 F 2.8 which gives the FS 5 an extra
stop of light and a very similar zoom
range that the Canon lenses relative to
the a7 s to top it off all three lenses
have in lens stabilization which will
help when we choose to shoot handheld
editing wise I decided to go with a
slightly lighter notebook than previous
use the msi ge62 2qf Apache Pro it
sports a fifth generation Intel 5700 HQ
clocked at 2.7 gigahertz 16 gigs of ram
and a 970 m and for the first time on a
work trip it actually fits in the laptop
compartment of my backpack which is a
huge plus for me last but not least we
have our lighting setups which compose
of a young duo LED light and a
flashpoint 3:12 LED light to be used on
any of the three cameras for when we
need light on our hosts in very dim
situations we also brought along one of
my new favorite lights the Westcott flex
which is a 10 by 10 inch flexible LED
panel that is very easy to roll up and
pack in a bag the Flex also has an
inline dimmer giving us full control of
the light output we will mainly be using
the Flex in situations where we have a
bit more time to setup for example this
week's upcoming on location LAN show the
Logitech G 633 headset features 7.1
Dolby surround sound thanks to Logitech
Gaming software the headphones port 40
millimeter Pro G audio drivers accented
on the outside by fully adjustable RGB
lighting with custom tags as well as a
well hidden cardio at boom mic you can
pick these up on amazon now link in the
video description below so that pretty
much covers all the tools we use to
deliver you guys the videos who will
