idea and while for some people myself
included the previous revisions actually
worked reasonably well the ongoing sound
card compatibility issues minimal
features and just plain old lack of
availability made them not a great
option for a lot of people a global
leader in tech recruiting is celebrating
geek pride by giving away 10 amazing
tech prizes for more info visit the
modus Facebook page or modus com
but none of those things were enough to
stop those folks from continuing to
refine the original concept being able
to keep your high quality headphones and
put a high quality boom style microphone
on them instead of resorting to one of
several other solutions that have always
felt a little bit cloudy to me clipping
your mic to your clothes tethers you to
your desk a desktop microphone picks up
a lot of ambient noise and switching to
a gaming headset when you game will
either give you rubbish audio quality on
your end or you'll be spending a fortune
on a quality all-in-one like the ath ag1
from Audio Technica
which just plain doesn't make sense if
you already have awesome headphones that
you like today all of that changes my
review unit of the mod mic 4.0 didn't
come in a package that looked like they
made it out of an old toilet paper roll
with a handwritten note taped to the
side wishing me luck no this will time I
get a handy dandy and surprisingly
rugged little carrying case with a
simple instruction manual that directs
you to the website if you have any
further questions to magnetic bases that
allow the mic to be rotated or removed
completely from whatever headphones you
attach them to gotta love them magnets
some extra adhesive for one of the bases
and finally an alcohol prep pad for
attaching the magnetic base to your
headphones the mod mic itself is thicker
than the old one and more robust feeling
in every way the microphone tip is
larger and has a nice snug fitting
windscreen that fits over top of it but
you should still be careful when
mounting it to keep the microphone off
to the side of your mouth instead of
directly in front of it for bed
sound quality and fewer plosives moving
down we've got the other half of the
magnetic mount and a clever little like
bending system that can be adjusted to
fit well in the lowered and raised
position without unnecessarily tugging
on you you can also adjust it if you
want and bend it however will fit you
best further down we find an inline mute
something that was seriously missing
from the older revisions and then a
thicker than normal but still flexible
and actually very lightweight wire that
terminates in a standard a three and a
half millimeter jack it's just little
things but they add up to a lot last
time the mod might felt like a really
exciting science fair project and this
time it feels like a finished product
from a real company but of course you
guys want to know how it sounds right
frankly great it blows the doors off
most of the gaming headset microphones
that I've heard and to my ear is closer
to the excellent microphone on the audio
technica headset that I mentioned before
then to anything else that I've heard
but you can judge for yourself selfs
selves or self however many people there
are watching right now here is a
microphone test with it this is my audio
recording test for the mod mic 4.0 it
sounds absolutely fantastic to me but I
guess I'll let you guys be the judge of
that
also there will be dancing involved in
this microphone test something that I
probably should have warned everyone
about before it happened
sorry now bear in mind the only
side-by-side comparison you're listening
to right now is with the $600 microphone
system that I'm using so for some more
fair comparisons check out the
SoundCloud link in the video description
which I will continue to add to as time
goes on so with all that out of the way
I'm sure you can draw your own
conclusions about a product like this
but here are my thoughts anyway I love
it it's a better implementation of a
product that I already liked it is a
little bit on the expensive side but it
sounds great and frankly for the target
audience people who have headphones that
sound better than gaming headsets the
price won't be unreasonable when you
consider the quality and functionality
of it and the fact that it allows you to
use that other investment you've already
made more often one thing that they
really need to figure out though even if
I don't have a solution off the top of
my head is the two-wire issue whether
it's through an optional accessory or
something that they include in the box
and lion needs to find a way to let me
manage the headphone and microphone
wires together so I don't end up with a
tangled mess they address this somehow
and this thing is pure gold as usual
guys the link to pricing and
availability for the ivory used an old
script so it says Plextor m6e SSD but
actually it's the modpack 4.0 is in the
video description below the like dislike
and share buttons which you should use
accordingly also in the video
description is a support link where you
can buy a t-shirt just like this one or
we've got a bunch of other designs we
actually have all of our designs in
stock right now which is cool you can
give us a monthly contribution or change
your amazon bookmark so we get an
affiliate kickback whenever you buy like
I don't know
shelving units or something like that
anyway it helps us out a lot thanks
