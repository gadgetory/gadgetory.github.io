77v premium now of note is the fact
actually doesn't even always release a
premium-grade motherboard they always
have a pro they always have a vanilla
you know sometimes they'll have you know
Ellie's or LX or whatever else mixed in
by they always have a deluxe but they
don't always have a premium because they
Sousa only releases a premium board when
they feel that there is some kind of a
feature set mix that they can bring to
the table that justifies the premium
moniker so in this case before we get
any further into it what makes this one
super special super premium above all
else is full native support for
Thunderbolts the Thunderbolt is built
right into the boards Thunderbolt gives
you up to ten gigabit per second which
is fully capable of running external
storage as well as displays even daisy
chained together at the same time moving
along we've got an M SATA 32 gig SSD
built in so that's as a caching solution
for whatever hard drive you might
actually connect to it we've also got
full support for their Wi-Fi go
technology including bluetooth as well
as the ability to use your board as a
Wi-Fi access point fan expert to is
included this is actually a fantastic
little piece of software within the AI
suite that lets you manage your fan
speeds and temperatures along custom
curves should you see fit to give you
guys some idea how important of a
feature I think that is I bought an over
a hundred dollar piece of hardware
called an Ncube key balancer to use in
my system just to give me that
functionality it comes built-in to your
board here smart DIGI+ so for better
overclocking yes this is definitely an
overclocking optimized board they've
also got their EP you and TPU so apu is
a one button way to undervolt and save
power with your system whereas TPU has a
couple of different options you can
either do it with the one button option
or you can have it tune itself to
overclock your system and get better
performance we have full support for
nvidia sli AMD crossfire x virtue MVP
which improves your performance as well
as offers GPU virtualization which
allows you to use Intel Quick Sync which
is a quick way of transcoding video even
though you have a dedicated graphics
card installed me
DTS DTS connect Intel z77 chipset
supports Intel Core processors it better
22 and 32 nanometer CPU support so that
second
and third generation Intel Core Series
processors and here we go we find a
whole lot of pretty much the same basic
stuff inside here it does talk a little
bit more about fan expert - including
your abilities to take advanced control
of detailed information about each fan
you can listen and locate the fans you
can get blah blah okay this is all good
stuff this is what I'm all about
oh no not this one not the RPM fix mode
that's cool so you can take all of your
fans and fix them at a given rpm which
is kind of neat this is the one that I'm
all about the one where you can create
whatever curves you want and according
to temperatures of various parts you
lock in each fan to whatever you want it
to adjust based on you can get your
system to keep itself at exactly the
cooling and noise level that you're
comfortable with ah SSD caching - so
this is cool so SSD caching - now has a
multiple caching option so you have four
for SSD cache incapable ports which
means you can do all kinds of cool stuff
including having two separate cache
volumes so - SSDs and two hard drives
and you can tune exactly the way you
want to do it you can have one SSD
that's caching like a volume of the
other three Drive so that gives you more
flexibility because in the past we've
only really seen casting solutions that
work are third-party caching solutions
that work with only two ports ok very -
MVP we've talked about USB 3 boost this
is important so you asp as well as their
turbo mood turbo mood turbo mood that's
like when you're like depressed but like
really really really fast
anyway turbo mode sorry guys
turbo mode and you asp give you options
to accelerate your USB 3 performance we
have a full NCIX tech tips coming out
about this soon network eye control uses
the Intel NICs built into this board it
actually has dual built in Intel network
cards to manage things like
POS for more optimized network
performance Thunderbolt ok up to
daisy-chain up to 6 Thunderbolt devices
a suits also put a lot of engineering
into making sure that it would be hot
pluggable because by nature PCI Express
is not a hot pluggable interface so they
had to do some spec
still tuning to the BIOS as well as the
driver in order to make this possible on
the PC do ok yes we've covered that
already we've covered that already so
easy installation for Intel Smart
Response and rapid start technology very
very cool Wi-Fi go is another really
neat feature that we've sort of already
talked about ok oh yeah I've known to do
with Wi-Fi go is I did a DLNA compatible
so you can use the only devices to
access stuff that you have on your
computer from your compatible media
player such as one from you know pin
vows or Patriot or another or Asus with
their own Oh play players as well so
that'll so that'll be over the network
so inside the accessory package we find
a whole lot of really good stuff I'm
just gonna take all these out and then
we'll have a look at some outside of the
box so it has a really big box you can
tell that it's a higher-end board
because the box is substantially larger
than their Pro Series board here I'm
gonna go get the pro series board box so
that you guys can see the physical
comparison you're getting like worn were
like different and more better stuff so
you check this out premium box compared
to pro box see look at that thickness
yeah that's a premium boy so why did
they need all of that space well because
there's tons of cool stuff in here
here's the Wi-Fi go module with Wi-Fi N
and Bluetooth here are the antennas
these are magnetic antennas which are
super handy means you can stick them to
the outside of your case so those are
for the Wi-Fi go module here are the
exclusive features user guide
walkthroughs ok we also have the Wi-Fi
go kart specific user guide for that guy
right there we've got the PhD 770
premium user guide including the
installation DVD which you should ignore
and download latest off the ESA's
website check this out
this is all English so this is a thick
thick user manual for your motherboard
which is great because detail is better
than not having detail yeah two-way
three-way and four-way republic of
gamers checked i don't you even get like
a republic of gamers a sli bridge to go
with your
Republic of gamers board but I mean with
these kinds of features it almost is
pretty close to that level we've also
got 4 SATA 3 6 gigabit per second cables
to SATA 2 3 gigabit per second cables a
IO shield with a few interesting color
codes so they've got the USB BIOS flash
back port color-coded and then the
button color-coded for you as well as
your USB 3 ports that are compatible
with the UA SP so they've gone ahead and
labeled that for you can configure them
in the AI suite whether you want to use
you ASP or whether you want to use bots
or standard mode but the fact that they
color code them free means you can more
easily figure out which ones are going
where because these ones that aren't you
ASP ready you can also use turbo mode on
those so I also like the positioning of
these up at the top because if you do
have to reach around the back or if you
do have a case that has a pass through
having it at the top is usually the
closest and most convenient place if Q
connectors are right here for more
convenient plugging in a front panel of
what nots and who has and last but not
least we've got an a suit USB 3 front
panel three and a half inch Bay since
nobody has a floppy drive anymore this
is a far more useful thing to put in
your three and a half inch Bay then
whatever else you were planning to put
in your three and a half inch base so
thanks to a soos for including that and
it used as an internal header not an
external pass-through which is
definitely ideal alright moving along to
the board itself this is yeah I mean I
was gonna say it's a premium board but
if you haven't figured that out based on
the name of the board already then
you're probably pretty new so we're just
gonna leave it at that I mean even the
fact that I thought we need to say it's
a premium board is pretty noob right
there by the way a lot of people
complain about how I touch PCBs let me
show you how I'm actually removing the
motherboard so this is the grip I have
on it which might look pretty bad on the
surface but let me show you what I'm
doing one thumb is on plastic components
here my fingers on the back are actually
on the metal spikes coming out of the
RAM slots on the other side of the board
I'm not touching the PCB touching the
edge of a PCB once again is fine so if
you watch when I hold a board like this
I'm positioning my
like this so once again I have my
fingers on those metal spikes I'm not
touching the piece to be the oil from
your fingers can damage PCBs and is not
very good for them so yes I'm aware of
that no I don't have my greasy fingers
all over the PCB I'd like to maneuver
boards by slots heat sinks and parts
where I don't actually have to touch it
I also avoid touching things like this
because your fingerprints will get on
them and they'll look ugly and greasy
because they're made of aluminum and
aluminum tends to stain when you get
fingerprint pile on aluminum yes not
good I hate fingerprints so that is what
I am doing I'm not just willy-nilly
touching the board all over the place
so let's have a look at the general
layout of the board right up here in the
top left corner I'm gonna start there
for a change because it's a bit of an
exceptional feature this board that is
where the Wi-Fi go module plugs in you
put that in there there's a space for it
in the back of the i/o shield right
there that's where you plug in your
antennas so that's pretty
straightforward there's a screw that is
a pre plugged into the Wi-Fi goecart so
it doesn't get lost just go ahead and
screw that in no big deal
the socket so this has an LGA 1155
socket which means you can't use 1156
processors it's fully compatible with
Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge so you can
use whatever CPU you want and overclock
the snot out of it with the huge
multi-phase digital vrm that this
premium level board has going on over
here it also has fairly beefy cooling
with your chipset cooled by just a
little guy here we got a heat pipe
connecting it to a much larger heatsink
that is responsible for cooling part of
the DDR M with another large heatsink
cooling the rest of it honestly these
Ivy Bridge CPUs with their 77 watt TDP
s-- don't really start to suck back
power and produce a lot of heat until
you overclock them so that's how you can
tell when a board is designed with
overclocking in mine because it'll have
all that space and all that cooling
going on for overclocking so we've got a
lot of logos on the board oh you know
what let's here I'll do my usual routine
and then we'll go into some of the other
more detailed stuff so right here is our
8 pin power connector and it's ideal
location at the top left of the board
here are our dual channel ddr3 slots so
all Ivy Bridge and Sandy Bridge CPUs
support only four slots that's why you
don't see any 1155 boards
that support more than four slots of
memory although technically all Ivy
Bridge and Sandy Bridge CPUs only
support up to 2 by 8 X configurations
for the PCIe slots but asus has clearly
cheated on that a little bit so we'll
talk more about that later
moving along here's your TPM plug here's
your 24 pin power connector in its ideal
location along the right-hand edge one
front USB 3 connector is located here
this is going to be running off of the
Intel chipset so that is according to
Intel spec you must have at least two
available front panel Intel USB 3
headers or USB 3 connectors
ok here is a SATA 3 ok say 2 3G port for
whatever reason I'm guessing that's
probably the same one that's the same
controller that's wired into something
on the back panel or something I don't
know why that oh I know why that's fair
ok give me a sec guys alright not so
complicated as all of that guys this is
a SATA this is just a regular
run-of-the-mill Intel C 2 to 3 gigabit
per second port these are your Intel
SATA 3 6 gigabit per second ports this
is another couple Intel SATA 2 3 gigabit
per second ports and this one is running
off your fourth say 2 to 3 gigabit per
second port on the intel controller so
that's an N SATA configuration right
there so it is power and data to an M
SATA drive which by the way you can swap
for something bigger should you so
desire however SRT technology only
supports up to 64 gigs on a single drive
anyway or is it 60 gigs or something in
that neighborhood so 32 gigs is plenty
for some storage drive that you plug in
in order to make sure that whatever
games you play most frequently or
whatever else is going to be cached and
ready to rock whenever you want so these
guys are special too so I okay I was a
little bit I was a little bit unclear
before but I've done I've read my notes
on this board so it's mostly optimized
for using - caching SSDs and - storage
drives now while the controller itself
may be capable in the future of
something like a raid 5 with an SSD
cache or something like that raid 5 on a
consumer level integrated chipsets is
not really the most ideal thing in the
world because it doesn't give you the
option to recover it in the event of a
hardware failure
anything like that unless you happen to
have an identical board or identical
chipset handy so it's not really ideal
but using them as a cache it's
definitely like recommended thumbs up
kind of configuration so these are
Marvel controllers these are Intel
controllers alright moving right along
front panel connectors USB 2.0 front
panel headers there's your clear
seamless button is there another one on
the back of the board
no no clear CMOS on the back of the
board that's kind of interesting but
there's one here so it's not the end oh
I forgot the memo k button so if you're
using high-speed memory which is far
more of a factor now on Ivy Bridge
platforms where we're seeing up to three
gigahertz memory kits being released you
want to make sure if you plug those in
you can use that if it doesn't post you
can use the memo K button to run it out
to force the board in the memory at a
super safe setting so that you can post
configure all your voltages and settings
correctly and then reboot okay here's
your post Diagnostics LED readout which
by the way not all boards have this but
a soos has taken the liberty of
including a comprehensive list oh yeah
this is another thing they do on their
higher-end boards you see a much more
comprehensive validated memory section
ok comprehensive list of AHA all of the
error codes that you might see off that
so how many times have you guys had a
board that has one of these error
readouts and then actually doesn't sorry
guys the battery died but what I was I
don't wanna harp on it for too long but
how many times have you guys had a board
that has one of these but you google
around and to no avail can you even find
out what the stupid post code on it even
means so there you go they tell you what
it means thank you a soos it's basic
stuff like that that really sets apart
the products that are good from the ones
that sort of are trying to be good GPU
and EPU buttons are right here Hardware
built in power and reset switches are
here there's your front panel audio as
well your spit it out
and that pretty much covers it for the
layout of the board however we got to
talk a little bit about these PCIe slots
first though let's have a look at the
fan header so what good is a bunch of
really cool software features to do with
your fan configuration if you don't have
lots of PWM fan headers one two three
four five and I believe I saw six six
PWM fan headers
built into this board and they're all
100% configure a table this is cool
stuff this is the bee's knees because
this is compatibility with up to and
these are PCIe gen3 those LEDs show you
which ones are active in Gen 3 mode and
that is a very expensive chip right
there so this board supports up to 8 X 8
X 8 X 8 X PCIe 3 now even in the event
of because remember these cheat these
TPU is only technically support 8 X 8 X
but that plx switching chip allows it to
achieve better balance basically it's a
it's a switch so it manages where the
data needs to go to to give you
effectively more bandwidth for running
more graphics cards not only that but
unlike the last generation less
expensive pcie 2.0 PL x chip this will
run even in a worst case scenario like
if you were gonna go oh well you know
blah blah blah the naysayer of PL x
chips and i think that if you've only
got 16 X PCIe 3 effective bandwidth here
then you can only have 4 X 4 X 4 X ports
even if you only had PCIe 3 4 X 4 X 4 X
4 X that would still be equivalent to
pcie 2.0 8 X 8 X 8 X 8 X which is more
than enough for 4 of any high-end
graphics card today
so even worst case scenario this thing
is going to be fully unleashed fully
functional for four-way SLI and 4-way
crossfire with four high-end graphics
cards which is very cool they also throw
in a couple PCIe 1x plus just in case
you need him and remember guys if you
want to run it way to card configuration
you're gonna go here and here they're
conveniently color-coded four-way
configurations will go here here here
and here and 3-way will be 1 2 3 don't
forget guys you can also plug in PCIe 1x
cards into 16x slots or 2x or 4x or 8x
into a 16x lot no problem other than
it'll have less bandwidth available
which won't matter unless you're running
like really I on Drake cars or anything
like that ok moving right along haha ok
so back port 2 eSATA ports 1 2 3 4 USB
3.0 ports optical audio out ok 2 USB 2.0
presumably under this sticker which I
think was actually supposed to be up
here but whatever there's two USB 2.0
ports under there trust me there ha
I can reapply stickers hey soos can hire
me to work as a playing a sticker player
okay
yes b22 intel gigabit ethernet ports
can't emphasize that enough
dual intel gigabit lan 7.1 audio we've
got hdmi and displayport
out for the onboard video built into
your IV Bridger Sandy Bridge processor
and right there last but not least
Thunderbolt so besides all the BIOS
tuning in software who odd that asus has
to go through to get a solution like
this working they also had a very
special approach that they took to the
traces as well as the location of the
Thunderbolt chip on the board itself see
see those curved traces as opposed to
here let's find a more traditional trace
ha over here I hope you guys can see
this in the lighting but can you see how
these traces go at 45-degree angles
right here and they're kind of sharp
angles these ones use a curve shape that
Asus found was better for the
transmission of data at very very high
speeds and the physical proximity of the
thunderbolt tip to the thunderbolt port
is also conducive to allowing it to have
better weld data integrity between these
two points here not only that but isus
also hasn't taken any of these traces
and routed them through the different
layers of the board's this also once
again reduces interference and increases
that integrity so as far as solutions go
for modern generation products this is
as good as it gets guys where they've
taken everything that they know about
designing motherboards and they're a
soos just saying and put it here to make
this Thunderbolt solution as fast and
reliable and pain-free as possible so
guys we're gonna have lots of
Thunderbolt stuff coming on NCIX tech
tips over the next little bit we've got
cool stuff like dips which is
Thunderbolt ready we've got cool stuff
leg thank you slick this which is also
founder already and don't forget guys
Thunderbolt looks the same as the mini
DisplayPort but it's not it is capable
of carrying mini DisplayPort or carrying
DisplayPort signals but you need a
specific
Thunderbolt cable in order to run fun
durable because it actually has
processors at either end of the cable in
addition to the processors on the
devices in order to make the 10 gigabit
per second throughput a possibility
remember guys Thunderbolt will also
continue to scale so we are going to
take these storage devices and this
monitor and we're going to show you guys
what Thunderbolt is all about in terms
of cabling convenience and no fuss no
mess it's great on the desktop great for
notebooks and I think that pretty much
covers our USB BIOS flashback don't
forget about that great feature you
don't even have to have CPU memory
installed you just throw a USB stick
into this port right here press the
button and it'll flash that BIOS to the
board making it so that even if new CPUs
come out or whatever else your BIOS
isn't compatible no big deal you can get
that taken care of
no problem and don't forget to subscribe
to - tech tips from unboxings reviews
and other computer and videos oh yeah
