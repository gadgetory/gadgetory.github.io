sense to those of you watching the vibe
we've got we're totally doing this for
the first time we've actually got some
pretty crap topics this week no yep
they're crap we do have we can polish it
we you can polish the crap as long as
it's not diarrhea oh man
try and polish diarrhea you just end up
with a more advanced process with the
might be linear well you could like put
it in like an ice cube tray
oh so you freeze it freeze it freeze it
then polish it yeah that more work that
possible I mean can you imagine a poop
ice cube like what would what would be
an appropriate context for that I mean
if you if you're if you improvise
projectiles that might also cause
disease yeah so if you're this far into
the show and you're thinking hmm is this
gonna be one of those ones where they
actually have tech news or is this gonna
be one of the ones where they just BS
right now hopefully that's already clear
yeah we do have some who do have some
he'll topics though a crash plan for
home says aurevoir that's good by an
Italian they are pulling out of the home
market Samsung's boss and heir jailed
for corruption - oh this just in Intel's
eighth generation mobile processors are
just updated seventh generation tips
tips chips they're not tips at all I'm
sorry I'm having I'm having one of those
but the tip of them has been updated I'm
gonna argument that like essentially the
same jet lag you know I was in New York
this week right yeah booth didn't oh no
you got back yesterday I got back a III
got ok I was at the airport in New York
at 5:30 Eastern Time yesterday whoa
so at 3:30 home time I was at an airport
getting on what would have been a 5:30
our times
shooting off a no on-boarding at this
airport at that airport then I flew for
six hours and I got off the plane at
10:30 a.m. our time and came to the
office for the day so I'm going with it
I'm going with the jet seem very tired
that day and I was like huh okay sure
well did you notice that I was only gone
for about thirty five hours I wasn't
here yeah to New York and back plus
doing the entire Samsung event on my own
on your own okay I only vaguely heard
about I had no camera person why because
you know okay we'll get to it after the
intro so the Vegas shortage could last
until October intro who is buying Vega
okay this is this would I don't know I'm
not yet okay what the crap
wait what about the other one why don't
I just try the other one oh yeah okay
fresh books the books that are fresh
turkey needs less fresh because it's
preserved because it's jerky it smoked
but relative relative to jerky yeah
relative to other jerky I guess it's
fresh yeah
in that there's less preservatives and
nitrates yeah okay hold on I'm gonna put
this back but why isn't my screenshare
working confused confused disorder
confused and disappointed and hold on I
didn't have the thing on and no it's
still not working
still not working I don't understand um
also this might be this is like you're
not working is that the official end of
the end of xsplit I don't know okay well
that's a vio has issues with explain
yeah
blames it on exploit and refuses to do
things because they blame it on
excellent yeah that's
yep offend yeah no I'm so okay that's
probably a topic of discussion is it
finally time for us to move to obs
let's find out and actually another good
discussion topic that we've got here is
is floatplane dying I don't know what
would make people think that but that is
definitely a I'm stoked on that as a
topic of conversation I have no idea
where that came from
I'm hosted in the doc what are we
talking about before we rolled the intro
and I said we were gonna talk about it
after the intro uh I don't know crap I
have no idea whatsoever
maybe twitch chat will help us with this
it's for playing dying where did you get
that from but I'm uh it's not yeah it's
not hold on are they gonna help us it's
doing quite well
people are asking if I dye my hair all
the trip to New York that's right Oh dye
my hair I'm only 31 I can't believe I'm
31 it's not too bad it's not too great
you look like a very young 31 Thanks
that's like saying you know for a corpse
you really don't look that decomposed
you don't look like you're new so don't
worry about it I wouldn't assume that
you're in your 30s you've aged a lot
since you like had kids and started this
put me to it started nice it started you
look really great for your 30s then it's
like wow man you are really on a
downward slope dude I am too
yeah but you can just shave your beard
and you okay
yeah you know what I'm going after it
because this is this is payback time
baby all right
your face looks horrible enough that's
right screw you dick I may be old but at
least I can show my face where is it I
wonder if I can find it there's the
Instagram posts from when I had to shave
for that video that we didn't get to
release yeah I know the comments on
there holy
I think there's people that like
legitimately think I'm a different
person okay but you know what though in
your defense I've been part of what I
think part of why it doesn't work for
you though is because your hairdo is
kind of like you have like kind of
things better when I had like these
bikes you have a choirboy hairdo but
then you offset it with the kind of
rugged racial hair yeah so when you have
like the no facial hair and then you
just have like the nice kind of yeah you
just you go kind of like yeah kind of
choirboy yeah I think when I had when I
had the spikes or when I just had like
the faux hawk kind of deal or just short
hair in general I think it I think you
did a little bit better yeah okay so we
were supposed to talk about the trip to
New York okay so here's what went down
okay um I have never been invited to a
Samsung launch event before this is the
first because you've just had like the
meetings yeah so I've had meetings with
like Samsung Canada yeah where I'll go
to like a hotel in Vancouver or a
restaurant one time and I'll get briefed
on the phone and a lot of the time this
is like a week or two after yes like the
unpacked event and marques and Jonathan
Morrison and Austin all those guys like
have full reviews up and I'm getting
briefed and I'm seeing the device for
the first time because get this because
it's just launching in Canada now yeah
which is like super stupid as though I
should give any cares when it launches
in Canada nobody cares when a device
launches in Canada and the kind of stuff
they'll cover at these briefings is
great they're like yeah and the blue
color is gonna be available exclusively
on Rogers why did okay someone will find
out from the video that they're
interested in the phone go to Rogers
calm and be like oh there's blue and
they'll buy it cool then they'll slap a
skin on it anyways or they'll never go
to Rogers calm and never know that they
had a blue one and not care yeah
in all likelihood right if we're being
honest right now they're asked vast
percentage of people so that's what I
would always happen so I was super
stoked to get an invite
the Samsung unpacked event because that
meant that I could actually do a
hands-on video at the same time that the
and every other press in the world mind
you the verge had an article or had a
video up while Austin and I were sitting
there at the audience going why do we
even attend these things like honestly
why are we even why are we even here
what's the point but that's a whole
other conversation verge out of videos
so they so they and so they invited me
up and I was like oh this is great yeah
I'd love to go do it
you know you want to build that
relationship I want to I want to be
timely on mobile stuff if I can at all
manage to do it and then I'm like okay
yeah so we need two tickets me and a
camera person which i think is fairly
reasonable for a publication of a power
impact and they're like oh sorry you
can't bring a camera person and I'm like
okay well can I just pay for their
ticket and pay for their hotel or even
just share a room like I don't care like
most of the camera people here I'm
buddy-buddy enough with that we could
just share a room no problem and then
they're like no we can't get you another
ticket for the event so even if I
brought my own camera person there you
can't get them inside they could only
get me one one ticket into the event
because again it's because I'm going
through Samsung Canada Samsung Canada
had 12 tickets for the entire country I
was I was going as far as like is this
like a fire marshal issue like they
literally can't bring more people into
the building it was full but the problem
is that Canada's allocation was so
little of it right but so Austin had
three people there because but he didn't
get his hotel in flight paid for and he
didn't get like there was this
activation after where why did he need
three people I was supposed to have look
at this I was supposed to have two to
three thousand dollars to go experience
New York with the note eight and they
were like yeah you could do like a
chopper flight or you could do this you
could I didn't end up doing anything
because I was busy editing my stupid
video that I shot that day so I didn't
even end up using it but guys you guys
have all this like influence her budget
but I can't buy a camera person to the
event with me
so Austin didn't have that because that
was just something Samsung Canada was
doing but this just all leads back to
like a larger fundamental issue which is
how fragmented yes yeah where one
company Samsung okay they have the verge
going live we don't know why a hashtag
free Luke is being spammed I don't know
what it means so they have the one
company has the verge going live with a
preview
yeah well the entire rest of the world
press which has like astronomically more
views than the rest of the stuff in that
channel while the entire rest of the
world press is sitting in an auditorium
waiting for the presentation to start
they've got the US and Canada and
whatever other countries with Wanko
allocations for press they have got and
and we've got completely different
programs for I would consider myself in
Austin pretty similar in terms of what
we are youtubers influencers like we
fall in the same category and he's got a
bias flight by his hotel but he can get
as many tickets as he wants I get a free
flight free hotel and a few grand to
spend on doing something cool in New
York but I can't bring a camera operator
yeah so it's just all over the place and
I just I feel like somewhere at some
point what could have even been sort of
interesting is if they gave you like one
of those phone gyro things and like you
were able to bring an editor yeah I got
you to like film the whole thing on the
phone yeah and they like gave you a
phone to talk about and display and they
give you a phone to film with yeah and
you're able to bring an editor so they
could actually have it exactly that
would be pretty neat and the other thing
too though is consistency like no one's
gonna be upset if everyone's kind of
doing the same thing yeah but like
honestly and I don't mean I hope she I
sincerely doubt she's watching but there
was another person in the media on the
media side of the presentation that was
sincerely taking notes from the
presentation on a little pad of paper
and wrote down like
ten things and I'm kind of sitting here
going like how are you even covering
this like what are you are you gonna
fold that up tie it to a pigeon and mail
it to someone what are you doing what
are you doing I think in written notes
before such that you are relevant enough
to be here and that yeah but she wasn't
it wasn't a speed thing cuz she didn't
even write my anything if she was
sitting right in front of me and I'm
sitting here going what could you
possibly be doing that doesn't require
you to digitize this at some point yeah
one of the things that I like about
paper notes and I know this isn't what
you're saying I'm just we have we have
to talk a lot today it could have no
news so I'm going for it yeah is is that
it's kind of like the OneNote idea if I
had like a surface book that I had fold
back with a pen then sure but that's I
don't have that what no stop so like I
can stop part way through and draw
something or do whatever I need okay
she's nothing and the note that was like
this big see my crease really hard to
see I normally have big ones like this
and we're sitting in a dark auditorium
because it's like presentation yeah
anytime that I've sat down at a
presentation if I had the option I did
laptop or even phone but if I'm like
being walked around a booth really
quickly I often just right right so you
know right tool for the job and I
totally get that but it was just like
why are you even here yeah
so what else we what else we got for
today actually oh oh why don't we talk
about is floatplane dying
well plain dying I don't I don't even
understand No
okay is that it yeah that was it in
other news are we gonna finally move to
OBS because my laptop screen capture is
still not working why don't you talk
about pros and cons while I see if I can
figure this out okay so if people have
watched my little stream I don't know if
I've ever talked about it on the LAN
show but I've done quite a few different
attempts of moving off of xsplit to OBS
because the amount of reading that
happens from everybody about how OBS is
so much better because it's open source
convinced me to try it a few tint a few
times and I decided that I didn't like
it
every single time until recently and I'm
sure I'm gonna receive an email about
this or a tweet or something but I've
been having a huge amount of problems
with xsplit and I'm not the only one and
a lot of them have to do with capture
cards and other different types of
things that we're trying to use and I'm
getting feedback from these companies
that make these devices that it just
doesn't work on xsplit and they're
blaming xsplit and they're refusing to
do anything about it so like I'm pretty
sure these stream deck doesn't work on
exploit and we've had to have problems
with it right yeah so the stream deck I
don't know what just happened oh dear oh
crap did you improve bsdi maybe hold on
well we theoretically still have audio
so I'm just gonna keep talking so you
don't really need to see me anyways so
continuing from there
I wanted to play horizon zero dawn and I
couldn't so I started trying to look
into OBS and man there's been some leaps
and bounds in terms of how good and
functional OBS is and it's still in my
opinion a very clunky UI I think they
have made a number of objectively
terrible design decisions but
functionality wise it does really well
the transport of stuff it does it does
well with the audio levels the audio
stuff on xsplit is just why there's just
like a volume bar that you can change
the level of and like a tiny very hard
to see level bounce that's just on the
bottom of the volume bar not in its own
area very difficult to see is completely
beyond me and OBS has individual levels
for all your things that are very easy
to see all the time that's wonderful
there's some really clunky things about
it but it works very well in terms of
the backend stuff and we use epifanov e
io capture cards because they're
wonderful and they don't like overheat
and do other junky things that a lot of
other capture cards that we've used have
done but they have compatibility issues
with xsplit and talking
over the last little while yes used to
yeah it's it seems to be new and that's
very frustrating so yeah moving off of
something that is theoretically paid for
to something that is free because the
free thing is better is just odd oh yeah
okay so uh this next news item is
actually from my email so hopefully I
don't expose anything critical but it
doesn't look like it CrashPlan for home
is going away thank you for using
CrashPlan for home we hope you have
enjoyed the secure backup that the free
version of CrashPlan for home has
provided as of today we've made the
decision to shift our business strategy
to focus on the enterprise and small
business segments Wow so this kind of
sucks because CrashPlan was like the
go-to for quick painless easy offsite
backup of your entire system so in
theory and you know there's some port
forwarding and whatever else that goes
along with it but in theory CrashPlan
was as simple as going okay here's all
the stuff I want to backup here's my
buddies crash plan code click and then
it would send over an encrypted version
of all of that stuff in like an
encrypted container file so that in the
event that you had some kind of a
catastrophic system failure you would be
able to at the very least backup all of
your all of your precious memories and
all that and you knew you didn't
necessarily even have to trust the
person on the other side you just had to
have enough of a working relationship
with them that you'd be able to get
physical access to the data at some
point or even back it up aw online if
you uh if you didn't have so much that
it would take like weeks to download or
whatever the case may be so as long as
you you didn't even have to trust each
other you just had to have like a
bilateral agreement that kind of goes
hey I'll have some extra storage in my
place you have some extra storage in
your place we'll back up to each other
boom done and right now I'm not a
hundred percent sure exactly what we're
going to
small business so what does that mean
well how much is that car I'm using this
personally though and small business is
I believe I forget but it's like a
significant cost per device okay
yeah so it really is priced like a small
business solution click to get CrashPlan
for small business here we go so let's
have a look at what we got here
so I'm in a bit of a better spot because
way back now to be completely honest I
got that Synology nas yeah and I can
Synology to Synology yes mirror which is
actually quite nice there's other things
you can do to on your own but nothing
that says elegant does this and this was
like the cross-platform thing you could
so I could use it on a Windows desktop
and I could be backing up to a CrashPlan
docker container on a nun raid server
for example so that was super cool but
yeah though here we go it's $10 per
device per month Wow for the business
one yeah so 120 bucks a year and what
kind of sucks about this it says you can
migrate all your cloud backups something
something yeah I don't think if yeah it
does not support computer-to-computer
backups anymore so that super sucks
because that was the whole that was the
whole reason why I would use CrashPlan
because it's going from thing I own to
thing that I own or is like I think my
friend owns instead of relying on you
know some corporation somewhere to keep
all of this stuff safe like I like the
idea of having everything on my servers
and especially not having to pay extra
for more cloud storage if I have a bunch
of crap I want to backup like if I have
a gigabit internet connection at my
office I would love to be able to just
flood it and they're not gonna like so
what happens if you've already got this
stuff set up because isn't this local
software it is local software um I
believe though that they can scan it
room yeah I believe they can can it
because the way that friends are tracked
is through
something where you just pointed out an
IP and it just goes yeah so maybe they
maybe they've had this in the plan for a
long time
maybe maybe the people who are smarter
than me are gonna go find some version
that you can kind of roll back to where
it all works or something like that
I'm not sure but in the meantime I'm
definitely going to be looking for some
other kind of solution and that's pretty
frustrating um
scroll all the way down all the way down
all the way down all the way to the
bottom almost right there clutter a
little bit up a bit that's life three oh
you gotta be kidding me nope actually
not so this was originally posted on the
forum by n to a newt and let's go ahead
and just kind of Wow that is so broken
there you go
that looks pretty good so half-life 2
episode 3 story released by Marc Laidlaw
the lead writer for the half-life series
who left valve last year Wow I have a
feeling this could get him in a lot of
trouble I really hope he's sought out
legal counsel yeah I hope he's lawyered
up man
wow that's pretty crazy rehab it's on
github and I believe it's in like quite
a few other places as well it's on paste
bin because people are worried about it
being brought down which is not
surprising at all apparently it wraps up
a lot of loose ends it's essentially
half-life 2 episode 3 yeah Wow
apparently the corrected versions where
it like fixes the genders and fixes a
few words that he like changed that
can't be enough to save him at all but
whatever is like a very coherent and
plausible plotline so it's from a
fictional character named Gertie Fremont
yeah but if you change that yeah who
recounts her team up with feisty partner
Alex vaunt
to find the Hyperborea luxury liner
which must be yeah so Wow
so he's like probably gonna get owned I
really like so there's no way of knowing
whether this was a finalized plot line
we have no way of knowing how far into
development half-life 2 episode 3 could
be a first draft yep
but apparently he was the primary
architect of half-life's plot and his
departure from valve last year was
widely seen as acknowledgment that
episode 3 was completely dead so maybe
if I can speculate wildly without
looking into anything that this guy said
publicly at all because I don't have a
lot of notes on it's just the land
showing yeah right let's do it yeah
percent so yeah fake news warning yeah
but I would I would assume that maybe
this is like he's the main architect for
the plot it says right there this is
probably like his masterpiece right so
while he might get screwed for this
maybe he just doesn't care
yeah
cuz like if you created this and like
the whole internet is like we want it so
bad yeah and it's like the greatest work
you've done I don't know I don't know
what else he's working yeah I mean I can
see how someone would feel like that
like but half-life is amazing so that
would be like an amazing thing to be the
greatest thing I'll tell you something
like we've considered just going live
with the channel super fun Top Gun
shot-for-shot volleyball scene
recreation and just taking the copyright
strike just so that people can watch it
like having it up there for long enough
that some people can watch it before you
guys rip down because like they're not
going to delete our channel
no realistically we're not a big enough
target to get sued into oblivion by what
is it columbia picture and if we do what
we just give them all the profits from
the video can't remember well no no
there's more to it than that as more to
it than that but like realistically
they're not gonna they're not gonna put
a target on their own back by like
trying to shut down I like to think a
fairly you know beloved YouTube creator
company like yeah like the amount of
public backlash over suing us into a
crater over us just doing a fan yeah
remake of a scene from one of their
movie like come on it seemed it seems
very implausible at some people like it
at all TX yeah yeah yeah like at some
point before an actual lawsuit occurs
some human looks at something and makes
a decision as to whether or not to
proceed with it and it's not necessarily
as simple as the black and white of law
yeah it's like is this worth the PR is
this worth the cost is this worth the
effort yeah and like that just to put
like what you just said just to dive
further into this topic that I know
nothing about yeah could be a reason why
valve might not go for this guy
valve is the like dream child of all the
PC gamers but remember to look at less
so these days for one thing and if you
don't protect your IP then you will be
seen as soft and you could open yourself
up to this kind of leak all the time
yeah
all of a sudden valve who might not have
a ton of employees but in terms of
revenues mass and profits is a gigantic
company I know I I think I think they
actually have no choice but to go after
him as hardcore as they can
like if honestly that sort if I was them
I would do it just because you can't set
a precedent like that and you can't have
someone you can't make it okay for that
to happen because someone might actually
come up with a game with dirty Fremont
and Alec savant yeah that is like the
exact thing like here and call it like
quarter lifespan three let's draw a
parallel right so let's say that lets
say that you decided to quit or
something like that you don't um yeah I
know you're like half halfway out the
door already but the point is let's say
you decide like what like three months
or so yeah let's say you decided to quit
and as the last thing that you did you
went around the office and you grabbed
your scrapyard wars PC yeah and let's
just let's just try and think of like
some you know what there that's that's
what I was going through the bone but
that's bombs kind of yours already
anyway like I think the Plasti Dip on it
is mine yeah it's not even yes
but the paint belongs to me all the
plastic you can take the whole Middlesex
yeah the whole middle section yeah yeah
but but let's say the scrapyard Wars PC
we're indisputably Linus Media Group
paid for oh yeah no that's yeah and it
was created on work time which your
employee agreement states that the
things you create are the intellectual
property of this comes I know that's
that's works which I'm sure he has a
very similar agreement in place certain
so let's say that you took off with it
and you were like I'm not giving this
bag I would have no choice even though I
don't actually care and as far as I'm
concerned you can have it because that
would be I didn't give you permission
yeah you just took that then be used
against you if someone else does it
possibly yes because you set a precedent
that this is okay yes and that could be
seen as like a benefit of working here
or something or something
either way I'm creating the potential
for this to come back and become a
problem and honestly in this case the
stakes are even so much lower than
someone you know leaking the plot yeah
oh yeah definitely
that's that's taking some property and
like displaying it in my house probably
yeah
the other thing would be taking property
and giving it to everyone that's right
that would be like taking a video that
we never released that I made yeah and
giving it everyone on my own channels
later yeah we're even if you had no
intention of profiting from it this is
something that a lot of people don't
necessarily understand is the definition
of profit does not necessarily come down
to the money that Luke makes like let's
say that Luke took it and did a stream
on his twitch channel where he
specifically the NDA expired so is the
argument here that the statute of
limitations is up because it's been a
year or something like that
well his NDA yeah his NDA from working
there as a parent so there's a
difference because very yeah an NDA and
intellectual property
yeah and stealing and disclosing
something that's under human yeah if he
was like I had a fully written script
for half-life 2 episode 3 that would be
a perfect example of something that
would be ND aid but not intellectual
property so anyway so bad literally the
script back to the example let's say
Luke decided that for that stream all
the money that came in was gonna go to a
charity or he was going to turn off
monetization for the video where he
displayed that video yeah um he still
profits in the sense that if even if I
can prove that even a single person went
and watched that stream who wouldn't
have otherwise he profited off of the
thing that didn't belong to him that he
stole from Linus Media Group in the
sense that he gained notoriety
you're saying get John I didn't yeah we
could go get John actually he's he's
upstairs we can you know what why don't
we come back to this topic a little bit
a little bit later in this I want to say
two things before we get John here so
that like everyone remembers so we can
bring this up one some people are
comparing this to h3h3
that's not at all no it's not the
content that was released by someone
else that was used in minor form for
parody completely drastically different
situation and another one this would be
sort of comparable to someone working at
like DreamWorks mm-hm and they make a
bunch of like internal animations and
different shorts as if and kind of stuff
that they don't get to completion and
then they quit and then a year later
they just really solve these publicly
yeah that's well get John here but I'm
like pretty Donnelly down I feel pretty
good about the position that I've taken
on it but hey he could always come in
and tell me I'm wrong in the meantime
why don't we do all this also American
so the laws are like slightly different
uh what do we got for how Wow you know
what's funny is we actually thought we
didn't have a lot of topics this week
but we've got a fair bit that we still
have a fair bit to talk about so let's
uh let's get through this what are you a
wait what we can do down to it okay
fresh books so if you're a small
business owner or a freelancer let's say
you do construction on the side or even
you do it as your full-time job how's
your painting you teach yoga classes out
of your garage you do small-time
computer repair or IT work for local
offices whatever it is you do fresh
books is all about giving you the tools
to make your organization your billing
and your accounting way simpler and
expenses which is the thing that a lot
of new businesses don't take proper
advantage of tracking expenses is
something that can be very tedious and
complicated but fresh books because it
comes with you on the go it's available
for iOS and Android allows you to just
track everything as you go so at the end
of the week you're not sitting there you
know spending a bunch of time creating
invoices you can create and invoices in
seconds so you're not spending a bunch
of time going oh how much should I work
on that job which days was it and then
you end up in an argument with the
client about like you know
it's it's stupid yeah FreshBooks allows
you to keep track of all that stuff and
if you have any questions they're there
to help you pick up the phone you call
fresh books a human picks up the line
and helps you out with it fresh books is
one of the only sponsors that we've ever
worked with where I have never seen a
complaint yeah that was not resolved in
a timely manner
by fresh books these guys are freaking
awesome and if you're a small business
owner and you want to simplify your
accounting go check them out at fresh
books calm slash win and enter when in

right John get in here you can take my
spot we're talking about the the
half-life 3 plot just so we can just
make a have you heard about this
I've seen this have you heard about this
okay okay why don't you actually look at
it while we do one one more time here
and come back and use my laptop use my
laptop yeah okay in the meantime I want
to jump into one of our other topics
here cream someone messed with me
someone put a spicy one in the crack
pepper and sea salt
I know it's delicious as usual but I
have the hiccups now cuz I wasn't
expecting it that wasn't me that
actually wasn't me I wouldn't be
surprised who's Ivan Jamison jackasses
everywhere what's his plan his plan was
to like have a whole bunch in the line
you don't know which ones the spicy one
and it's like roulette party we should
do that as a channel SuperFlow never
kind of a fun channel super beef jerky
roulette all right this was originally
posted over on Ars Technica and Intel's
not really hiding it but they recently
launched eighth generation mobile chips
and the the assumption I think from a
lot of people even fairly tech-savvy P
assumed this the assumption was that an
eighth generation mobile chip would be
coffee lake which is their upcoming
architecture nope these quad-core dang
it these quad-core you class mobile
chips which by the by the way is pretty
freakin sick so bass clocks of anywhere
from 1.6 to 1.9 gigahertz and boosts
clocks of a three point four to 3.9
gigahertz that four core cores
yep with and these are all 15 watt parts
are pretty darn impressive and are gonna
enable a completely new class of mobile
device like I'm really looking forward
to see if LG does a 20-18 gram with
these processes right yeah or something
like it cuz a quad core it's really the
only thing I'm missing you've already
got an nvme SSD you've already got 16
gigs plus of ram so the one thing
missing is more multi-threading
performance and
they're even hyper-threaded so we're
talking four cores eight threads these
things look sick unfortunately this is
not nearly the shift that we were
possibly expecting they are built on a
somewhat refined version of Intel's 14
nanometer manufacturing process and even
though they're calling them 8th gen they
are actually much more similar both CPU
and GPU to for the seventh generation KB
Lakes so they're calling these KB Lake
refresh which if my experience has
anything to go on basically means KB
Lake yeah
and it's frustrating because the whole
idea from the highlig with like a better
and/or understanding of their bidding
yeah the whole idea and they will until
is iterating all the time so it's KB
Lake refresh but they're probably
already using all the things they
learned in other cable a chips as it is
hmm because they are making changes over
time sure sorry John we're almost ready
for you sorry but it's frustrating
because the whole idea behind this gen
thing is you're supposed to be able to
understand what generation the freaking
thing is architectural II and now we've
got seventh generation processors on the
h EDT side that are skylake based we've
got seventh generation processors on the
mainstream side that are KB Lake based
and then we've got eight generation
processors that are KB Lake based is
nothing sacred
no so um yeah
oh but to be clear the h EDT ones I'm
talking about are like the 7900 X so
that because it has a seven its seventh
gen but it is actually a sixth
generation skylake architecture so now
there's gonna have to be like the intel
version and there's gonna have to be
like the enthusiasts who has it was
keeping track of this on their own
version of what gen everything is
alright so let's go around another tech
wiki video let's let John jump in and
talk about this whole half-life 3 thing
I'll give you my spot here we go okay so
half-life 3 how does how does this work
cuz we think - and I are both in
agreement right now mm-hmm
that's some people in the chat are
saying like Oh his NDA lifted but we
don't think this is an NDA thing and our
opinion would be covered under NDA if he
was just like I had completed a script
for half-life 2 episode 3 and that's all
he says that seems like an NDA style
thing him actually releasing all the
content it does not seem like an NDA
protected action
I mean NDA's can be written pretty
broadly though yeah you can you can
write an NDA so what right but what
we're saying is like people are saying
that the NDA has lifted because he
hasn't worked there for a year mm-hmm so
he's released this content not being a
employee of valve anymore mm-hmm and
people are saying that he's fine because
the NDA lifted does that make any sense
it does sorry if I seem a little bit
confusing very confused well no it's
more that I don't I can't really think
of a reason why that wouldn't make sense
honestly okay so if I work at line
effectives and we make a series of
videos called scrapyard Wars mm-hmm and
we make scrap redhorse
here we make scrapyard wars episode 7
and edie finishes editing them but then
linus hates me so fires me
and doesn't want to release the episodes
anymore because it wants nothing to do
with me and I have all the copies of the
episodes and I release them somewhere
else because my NDA expired how does
that make any sense uh well you're
covering different things with an NDA
versus just a separate agreement saying
that you don't own copyright in it but
this is this is content like did you
actually see the post
I read the bullet points below it no
yeah no this is what he released okay
which is like the script so he like
changed well it's like it's a letter
from one character to another and the
names and places have been changed but
it's extremely obvious but like Gordon
Freeman is Curtis something dirty
Fremont yeah Permenter or something so
wouldn't a storyline be considered IP
and would that be covered separately
from an NDA you could cover it under
both okay there's no I don't see a
reason you couldn't do that so
so do you think it's possible that he's
off the hook here is he in trouble with
valve his valve but no one knows no one
knows yet we're trying to figure out if
he's in trouble with valve yeah I feel
like Kyle wouldn't construct their NBA
in a way that makes it so that you can
just release whatever you've worked on
after you leave for a year I don't know
why anyone would ever do that
mm-hmm that makes no sense it could be
but knock I was saying you could it
could be under or it could be covered or
something else that isn't an NDA so even
if they say if they structure something
this says right but we're talking about
if it's not covered not if it is covered
oh okay so you're you're asking me if
this isn't covered by an NDA
yeah I'm not asking if it's covered by
other things if you don't know we don't
know there's no information about that
at all all we know what you lady what
the likelihood is that he's okay here
based on what based on because you're
asking that he revealed the plotline of
something that he was working on at
valve and is therefore the intellectual
property of valve mm-hmm after leaving
I mean I have no way to say like it
completely depends on like how much
valve values this information so and who
knows if they do or not you know or they
you know where they actually going
planning to release a sequel or not so
interesting okay I had thought I had
thought it would be a little more open
shut than that like that well we're
making some assumptions we're making
assumptions that valve is gonna
aggressively protect its intellectual
property regardless of whether you
mattered or not mm-hmm because that's
kind of a bad precedent if they just let
people walk away with this stuff
well I mean you're right and that it
probably would be considered IP like
you're you're you are probably right
about that but like at the same time is
if you're going to sit here and ask oh
how much trouble is he possibly in yeah
impossible to say it really depends on
what that wants to do okay yeah
all right thank you yep so so it sounds
like we weren't that far off we were
just making kind of a different set of
assumptions about how we think valve
would behave yeah that may or may not be
right so we're just gonna have to wait
and see how this one shakes out
according to apparently he has released
a tweet I don't know where it went my
boss good quick sure why don't you have
a look while I jump in and talk about
the Vega shortage okay so this was
originally posted over on video cards
calm and actually there's a post by
co-axial gamer over on the forum than
the original article bears from PC games
and dot-com but apparently the Vega
shortage could last until October in
spite of AMD's efforts to keep our X
Vega prices low so this is from video
cards according to well-informed sources
of digi times you should not expect to
find our X Vega in stores at least at a
normal price until October while AMD
promised to prepare a height to prepare
a high volume of rx Vega graphics cards
for launch the reality was that many
countries apparently did not receive a
single unit of the new flagship card
the problem allegedly lies in the
complexity of the Vega chips other
sources claim that less issue may lie in
advanced semiconductor engineering
packaging technology if I had to guess
and this would be pure speculation I
would say it probably has a lot to do
with HBM - and maybe not necessarily
even the amount of HP m2 that AMD can
buy but possibly as much as that to do
with AMD simply not wanting to buy that
much HBM - right now because right now
they're one of the only ones using it so
if they put in a massive order they
would themselves inherently spike the
pricing that's something that is a very
limited commodity and that just Fuca I
mean anyone can look at this underground
exchange something that went up
drastically in price in the couple of
weeks before rx vega's official launch
so if I was AMD I would be probably
trying to ride it out until another
competitor starts building HBM - which
is supposedly going to happen fairly
soon and I would be yeah like I wouldn't
be going out of my way to produce a
bunch of cards that I'm maybe not even
making money on I'm just I'm speculating
though yeah haha fair one thing I want
to add I found I found the tweet he
tweeted saying my website's down for now
I guess a fanfic is popular even a
gender swapped snapshot and snapshot of
a dream I had many years ago so is that
him backpedaling on I don't even know
how because he wants to be a forward
pedal at all or did the Internet is
freako maybe I don't know that could be
a case I kind of think it's probably
fairly not a big deal and I'm gonna make
another wild assumption based on no
information because fake news is really
fun
man chill man but my idea here is that
it's on his own website his pen to tweet
is him trying to sell books that he's
written he's trying to sell books that
he's written an easy way to get a whole
bunch of traffic to his website which
did happen and to get more interest
around him and his books is so it right
bag on the thing that he if it
legitimately had nothing to do with any
kind of planet valve
then I think it's fine because I believe
fanfic is like okay I think you're
allowed to do that and letting the
internet go full conspiracy theory is a
great marketing tactic I don't know how
long interesting took until he clarified
it right I like your new theory I like
that one the most
um okay in other news this was from PC
games and calm
AMD says they're trying to keep prices
of our expect low though so after the
prices inflated after launch AMD now
says it's trying its best to get those
prices to where we suggested when we
launched them so there AMD's Gerald
Youngblood says our SE P so that's
suggested prices and the price tag that
we announced is our full intention of
where we would suggest the product be
priced not just for launch but ongoing
they said the price surge did you know
overwhelming demand and that the filling
of retailers inventory is key to getting
the prices of Vega down to their
original pre-launch levels yeah that
makes sense
but again so we're looking at AMD having
to having to put pressure on retailers
which a lot of the time manifests as
like a rebate or something and you know
that whole thing broke a little while
ago we expressed our frustration with
you yeah again this is more evidence for
AMD not really having much motivation to
provide as much Vega as they possibly
can right now because here's what you
guys need to understand AMD does not
profit from the mining craze and from
the prices being jacked up $200 on the
shelf the retailer and/or the
opportunistic reseller who runs out to a
store whenever they find it at regular
price and then flips it on ebay they
profit AMD doesn't want that because
they're effectively creating a bunch of
hate in their community and a bunch of
anger and they don't even get to make
more money out of it yeah
so you shouldn't really think about this
emotionally you have to think about it
rationally it's it's not an AMD's best
interest unless they are actually
raising the price of the product
Rattata piss everyone off to have the
street price be high
yeah so you know I've talked to them I
can't share everything that was shared
with me but I'll say benefit of the
doubt I still and you can go back and
watch last week's planned show if you
want to know what I'm upset about I'm
still upset about pretty much all of it
AMD could have done a way better job of
communicating the way that they were
handling this launch pricing because if
they had told me that it was going to be
through rebates I would have known that
the entire thing was going to be a
cluster and this is okay so this is a
situation where like I've never been on
the other end so I don't know there's
unknown variables here but sometimes the
communication stuff that happens
directed towards us from a wide variety
of companies I'm not even going to
narrow down to AMD right now yeah it's
just very not good yeah and it doesn't
seem that hard well it seems hard when
you make things hard on yourself
so a lot of the miscommunication around
Vega had to do with that the originally
we're gonna just lift the embargo on
Vega 64 the flagship card and then at
the last second decided to lift the
embargo on so 56 you don't do that right
but think about it this way it's not the
people who are actually in the trenches
with NVIDIA card in their right hand and
upcoming AMD card in their left hand
testing them against each other who like
actually know how this whole thing is
going to shake down and how the press is
going to react to it it's not those
people making the decision unfortunately
it's probably some executive making the
decision and then ultimately and I told
you so a moment that takes place once
the hardware is already in the hands of
the reviewers and they get some initial
feedback that hey this isn't gonna be a
super positive review because hey Vegas
64 is not crazy competitive like it's
it's not a game changer guys so some
some executive who's in la-la-land
probably got that feedback and mate was
like okay fine let's do it your way
let's launch the one that actually makes
sense Vega 56 at the same time so we
don't end up with a bunch of negative
press to lose our momentum that's
probably how it went down and I'm
speculating I told you guys I had a call
with AMD that
was definitely not confirmed or talked
about but that's what I would guess went
on and that's how these things keep
happening because it's the same bloody
thing with rising seven originally they
were gonna rollouts the ski use two
weeks apart and then the last second
they're like oh no we're lifting the
embargo on all of them and only a
handful of press actually got them all
so get them to us in time someone in the
chat was like okay I don't I don't know
where the message is so I'm gonna
verbatim this and we gonna get a little
bit of it wrong sorry but some of the
chat so something along the lines of
yeah but you were just blinded by
wanting the profits of releasing the
video on launch day I don't think that's
valid personally I wasn't a part of the
video creation process for that but from
my view I don't think it's being blinded
when to be able to see that you would
have had to make extremely wild drastic
assumptions that wouldn't have made any
sense in the moment um yeah and it has
that would have been very a very weird
thing to assume here's the thing is I
think people underestimate how much
profit there is in having a video up a
day or two earlier for us a main issue
from what I heard yeah and like again
the reason why I keep on putting this in
is because I'm actually outside of the
circle but the main issue that I heard
was that we had a completed video yeah
we did that would have been a problem if
we released yeah because now there was
new information is what we were
correcting a problem we were we were
completely done our Vegas 64 launch
video with the air cooled and the liquid
cooled card someone says lgt is totally
sell out we do sponsor spots we do ads
we have work with companies but we are
very transparent when we do so yeah and
that has not wanting to repeat work that
you've done because someone else made a
terrible last-minute decision that
screws you over I think is a perfectly
reasonable stance yeah and as for
getting content out on launch day
honestly we don't make a bunch more
money for doing that a YouTube view is
not worth nearly as much as you might
think in terms of monetary value so yeah
we'll get a few more views but for me
it's more about making sure that we're
perceived as a place that you go when
you go and get
like graphics card news about a new card
that launches and if you know let's say
let's say we weren't able to bring
people in on the weekend if our video
goes up and it's just Vegas 64 and
everyone else's video or written review
goes up in its negative 56 and Vegas 64
it makes us look stupid and we don't
want that and we shouldn't have to work
through the weekend in order to do that
companies should be respectful of our
time in our schedules and the fact that
we have lives and kids and other things
we have to deal with that's the issue
what about likes are they worth more
profit no legs are worth nothing exactly
zero some guy said Luke likes negative
comments they can be helpful because if
someone's thinking those things
genuinely it's good to address it and
help them understand that they're wrong
absolutely um okay this was posted
originally on the forum by James had
like an hour to throw together the dock
today so I don't blame him for not being
there NumLock 21 yeah I know and the
original article here is from Tom's
Hardware AMD has gone into a little bit
more detail about their epic and thread
Ripper tip designs claiming a 41% cost
reduction which would actually account
for the difference in price between AMD
16 core chip in Intel's yeah which is
pretty cool so they decided to go with
like this modular design versus a
monolithic design because even though
the modular design because of the
interconnects is ten percent higher in
costs so ten percent more die space
apparently it saves so many failures
allowing them to alright save so many
failures that they can just take higher
yield ones and quote unquote glue them
together that they actually reduce their
cost by they estimate 41 percent that's
pretty freakin cool
that is actually very cool and that's
very good for them specifically yeah to
be honest because the consumer need to
be making money so that they can
actually keep doing things so you like
superdude amazon has made its first big
move with Whole Foods the original
article here is from Bloomberg my Prime
members get discounts
foods so you can pay just a less
inflated price for groceries and paper
bags instead of plastic bags because
you're a giant hipster not that I'm
judging I've shopped at Whole Foods they
also plan to make Prime the customer
rewards program at Whole Foods and
products from Whole Foods private label
365 will be available on Amazon they
have not yet indicated a timeframe for
all these changes I technically have
never shopped there but I've shopped it
- like the like Langley alternative ok
yeah it's um it's it's so it's so funny
it's odd smells like health food the
structure of it is very much like a like
a chain clothing store like a Hollister
I think is the one that always smells
like cedar wood mmm is it Hollister I
don't I don't I don't know close my
doors but you know how you walk in the
last time was it a mole and they like
feel really unique mm-hmm and then you
go to another one of the same store
somewhere else and it's exactly the same
flavor of totally unique where it's this
very contrived yeah you know we do this
totally differently than everybody else
so uh
ya know I shopped at Whole Foods I think
I've been there twice once because it
was the only thing within walking
distance of my hotel yeah and another
time because I really needed an ice
cream bar and I bought the only like
with fat with dairy with gluten ice
cream bar the whole store actually no I
think it was gluten-free by the way if
you're in Vancouver I believe this
weekend or maybe only for one specific
day but look it up uber is like coming
here now to Vancouver I know one and I
believe they're showing up by doing free
ice cream bar deliveries Oh sad I think
it's only in Vancouver SEK I don't think
they're doing all Hoover all the way out
of here if they are doing uber all the
way out here I am getting my free ice
cream bar actually even if not I might
just like go down there to get a free
ice cream bar because I'm going down
there on Saturday anyways what else do
we have this is from Bloomberg Apple
reported to unveil a new Apple TV
that'll be faster 4k HDR video blip
Adeeb lopunny thanks
- is coming October 5th rumor rumor
rumor originally posted by TechCrunch
and um yeah it looks like a phone it
looks like a phone it looks like a pixel
it it has a thing here that's kind of
pixely yeah the bezels are smaller a lot
smaller yeah way smaller snapdragon 836
but that it would have front-facing
speakers I love that note that's my
favorite note from today apparently a
two-to-one aspect ratio okay I know that
mathematically there's no reason to call
what is it yet to call 16 by 10 16 by 10
right you could just as easily call it 8
by 5 but for the sake of making life a
little easier I kind of wish everyone
would go like by 9 since we all know
what 16 by 9 is yeah but what is a
two-to-one aspect ratio so that would be
18 by 9 I guess yeah 18 by 9 but the
fact that I have to convert it all the
time is gonna drive me crazy
to be fair this probably affects almost
no one but you so there's some rumors
but I do understand where you're coming
from 4.9 7 inch 1080p display for the
smaller one with a 6 inch on the larger
XL apparently it'll be provided by LG
it'll support
it'll sport four gigs of RAM on board
internal storage might get boosted to 64
gigs and it's probably got a great
camera it might there's a lot of like it
could it might yeah there's a it might
drop the headphone port but link might
have front-facing speakers it might have
squeezable side it might have bluetooth
wow it might be able to connect to the
internet okay we don't know maybe
they're going with the world's first
modern smartphone without the internet
Wi-Fi hotspot' only I think we're
probably done with this so we will see
you again next week same bat time same
bat checks photos of the new space suit
are actually super cool have you seen
these and you can
that I know I'm a fanboy but like
they're pretty neat
all right fine we'll look at the new
space wait these are the ones that I saw
these aren't as cool oh they're still
pretty cool those don't look that
amazing no where's the cool ones these
are space suits where's the cool ones I
think you're just I think you're done I
think that's the wrong article that is
the wrong article okay here's the right
article dang it James for throwing this
together in an hour and screwing up one
thing so far it also doesn't have the
other photo whatever let's talk about
full plane stuff yeah float plane not
dead not dead definitely not dead doing
great actually got a meeting really day
people were cool thanks for showing up
guys at work on floatplane outdoor
gaming the ultimate view camping battle
station I think we need a new thumbnail
for this one that makes it more clear
that we are in the middle of a forest
gaming on like a freaking awesome gaming
PC mm-hmm
let's see mezzanine update I forgot to
upload that I did at the last minute
there this is a really cool video I
think a lot of you will like it
we designed the ultimate gaming TV have
you seen this have your notice No so
Alex and I worked on this together and
we basically conceptualized what what a
perfect TV for gamers would be and this
is just a couple of we've probably got
somewhere between six and ten features
that TV makers for whatever reason have
their heads too far up their rank I've
heard about one of the features okay so
one of them was an integrated what's
that stupid thing called that you have
that analog to digital converter whoa
what's that thing called again
framemeister framemeister so is it
actually a frame waster so think about
it think about this it doesn't have to
be no as long as it was something quite
similar so the framemeister actually
here where no okay i framemeister is
probably like a little too overkill for
most yes so it cost about $400 for a
framemeister which is this external box
that takes your analog source like a
Super Nintendo or a PlayStation 1 and
converts it to HDMI with next to no
latency be
as you may or may not have noticed your
TV if it takes in an analog source does
a couple of things number one is even
compared to its normal input leg it adds
even more loin and number two is it does
a craptastic job of the conversion it'll
look like garbage
so the framemeister does a great job of
both of those things yeah at $400 it's a
lot it's a lot but when you look at a
premium TV you look at the bond cost of
a premium TV we're talking like five six
seven thousand US dollars is it
unreasonable to think a couple of things
number one that by cheeping out on some
stuff we don't care about like how thin
it is that they could find some of that
cost to spend on good analog to digital
conversion and number two that they
could achieve economies of scale that
would make a framemeister cost a lot
less expensive hardware really aren't
that many frame wasters that's one of
the reasons why they're so expensive
exactly so anyway that was one of the
ideas so retro gamers could game on
their new TV and have a not crap
experience so we've got a bunch of other
ideas a modular system for the speakers
yeah that's the one thing I heard about
so you can take them off they just clip
on and they have like just contacts that
go or you could take them off reposition
them run speaker wire and then you could
add like the rest of a kit or something
like that
DisplayPort in was one of the things we
asked for so there's a bunch of stuff a
lot of which would be very low costs to
implement or I'll return to front i/o
right yeah like come on bring back I
always nice I don't mind a little chin
bar you know give me an so front front
USB charging ports for controllers for
like VR accessories things like that so
there's just a bunch of stuff we came up
with we designed what we think is a
gaming TV and we would love for the TV
industry to you know maybe wake the crap
up we took a look at the first all AMD
gaming PC from Dell
it's like taped over the side well yeah
but there's an actual chip inside - that
was for illustrative purposes Lou that's
awesome how many PCIe extensions is too
many
and the answer is a lot was it still
working then you bet oh my god um that's
crazy
organization vlog day one Wow we've
actually got a lot of good stuff on here
