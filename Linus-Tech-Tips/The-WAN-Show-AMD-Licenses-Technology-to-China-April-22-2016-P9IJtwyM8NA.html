guys it's Friday I'm broadcasting live
from the studio here in lovely Langley
British Columbia and quite frankly I'd
rather be at home playing games on the
HTC vive I will definitely be spending
some time on the show today talking
about that
I will definitely acknowledge my
unfortunately downgraded but still
somewhat sexy co-host here and I will
definitely tell you all of the topics
that we are going to be covering on the
show today after the intro hold on I got
this there may even be music today let's
see if I fixed it
also whoa some of you guys were asking
where Luke is Luke is in a place doing a
thing
the place is called PAX East and whoever
whoever did up the pax thing here
doesn't realize that packs is Penny
Arcade Expo not a word that starts with
a P and has two small letters after
that's okay
taxis 2016 so huge thanks to Logitech G
and discord for powering our pack C's
2016 content yes my friends for the
first time ever
Linus Media Group actually had two away
teams at the same time so Taryn and
Brandon were down at NAB in Las Vegas
and before they returned Luke Burkle and
Dennis actually left to go cover PAX
East so we're gonna have like an entire
week of show coverage for you guys and
in the meantime I've been back here in
the studio with David and Edie and well
yeah I guess that's about it and we've
been working on some really cool stuff
so we've got the review of the iPhone se
coming up we've got a power bank like
battery bank showdown coming up we've
got um I don't this is a video nobody
asked for but I was kind of interested
in and so I decided to make but I've got
a video up coming on IPMI which is a
remote management interface that exists
on some motherboard so it allows you to
log in from anywhere and like power on
the server power down the server change
BIOS settings even all kinds of cool
stuff like that so so I've been working
on some videos and they've been working
on some videos and it's all good stuff
and okay right so I will I'll answer
those questions that I said I was gonna
answer this is my new co-host her name
is Kay ku something I'm making that up I
know she's an actual character from an
actual show I don't know what it is I've
got people talking about wake-on-lan yes
yes I go through wake-on-lan in the
video I actually have some other cool
solutions that I guarantee you've never
heard of as well yes I know Yoko
apparently it's Yoko I don't know I'm
sorry you know for me it's just
you know a pillow I was on Amazon and I
was just browsing toys not those kinds
of toys I was browsing toys and I was
just trying to find stuff for channel
super fun so this was around the time
leading up to the big move into the new
studio and so I was just like what the
hell is this it's a it's a waifu pillow
you gotta be kidding me
so I ordered it having no idea what I
was gonna do like I was I was thinking
initially I would try and do some kind
of a prank where I called people down to
help me with something and then like I'd
have a hidden camera and then I'd be
like making out with it or something and
I'd get like reaction shots from people
but we ended up coming up with the
channel super fun where we did the
cuddle challenge I think that ended up
being a lot better anyway I don't know
how well that video is doing you know
honestly I feel like I feel like channel
super fun just should do so much better
but like nothing ever really catches on
for us on that channel like it doesn't
go it doesn't go viral or whatever else
forgot people telling me to get another
human the office is like empty I mean do
you really want me to pull Nick light in
here
alright come on it'd be like the worst
thing ever so I promised to discuss if
okay before before I get into that I
will go through some of these some of
the top topics for today Intel to cut
12,000 jobs as PC demand wanes ouch
researchers accidentally discover
technology that could lead to batteries
that can be charged many more times than
current ones nerd sports has launched on
vessel so this is something that we've
had a lot of people asking about seeking
clarification on so nerd sports is a new
series that we developed it was funded
by vessel comm so if you guys are
familiar with vessel it's the early
access platform that our videos go up on
generally speaking one week before
YouTube but this is different
nerd sports is exclusive to vessel and
it's a series that we developed we've
done five episodes are filmed
episode so far three of which are
actually done one of which is released
where basically the linus media group
team we call ourselves the keyboard
warriors takes on actual sports teams so
the first sports that we did were paths
actually we filmed it like eight years
ago at this point there's projects like
this takes so long so volleyball
dodgeball lacrosse ice hockey and
curling so the first episode is
volleyball it's awesome we actually take
on the Trinity Western Spartans who are
the top college women's volleyball team
in the country as of last year and it is
it is actually pretty hilarious I don't
think I'm technically supposed to do
this because like there is a trailer and
stuff but I will I will play just I will
play just a little bit of it so where
videos here we go I'm just gonna grab
some grab a couple of chunks out of it
here
fit loads of course everyone's probably
like hitting it all at the same time now
thanks guys that's weird yeah that's
working no we'll be back um
so nerd Sports is available now it's
gonna be released weekly for the next
four weeks over on vessel comm what else
do we have
uh yes a mosquito killing billboard
pretty freaking cool okay
so now with all that aside I have to
take some time to talk about the HTC
vive and I know you guys are thinking
all right Luke's not here on the show I
don't have to listen to anyone talk
about talk about VR for the next hour
and a half but you were wrong everything
about everything about that was wrong
I'm definitely gonna be talking about V
R so the HTC vive arrived yesterday
afternoon at which time I promptly
completely abandoned everything else
that I had planned for that evening I
got home I was like hi kids by kids and
locked myself upstairs they were allowed
in afterwards but only if they agreed to
help me set up the vibe I locked myself
upstairs to set up the vibe it takes the
moat it's the most agonizing like hour
ever because I kind of thought it would
come with like floor stands or something
for the lighthouse units it does not
they just expect you to wall mount it so
I was like ah Vaughn I'll be painting
this room soon because we've actually
discussed it and she's like yeah I think
I think so we had we had said we were
going to him like okay I'm putting about
two holes in the wall so I'm just in
there just like drilling random holes in
the wall mounting light house it takes
about an hour to set up and you just
like I just want to play VR games I just
buy the archives um so then at that time
I kind of realized again that I had
derped and that I should have done this
at the beginning but I realized oh I I
don't have any VR games downloaded so I
had to I had to go buy some VR games
right away and then I had to
go ahead and wait for those to download
while I finish the setup and then I
spent about two hours straight for the
first time playing a single-player
experience in I don't even know like I
can't even begin to imagine how long
it's been since I've since I've done
that in a single-player game like I'll
drop in and like I was playing Team
Fortress 2 if with Luke actually the
other night he was streaming on his
twitch channel and stuff but like just
playing single-player games it's been a
long time but I was playing a space
pirate trainer it is freaking cool
you've got like a shield and a blaster
and you can like switch out your shield
your blaster it is unbelievably fun I
had I had a lot of people say yeah enjoy
your enjoy your headache after 30
minutes you know what two hours almost
uninterrupted my wife was playing for a
little bit
two hours almost uninterrupted and I was
feeling good like I was 100 percent fine
at the end of that it was it was
freaking awesome I can't wait to go home
and play with it more there are still
issues like the setup process is not
perfect I ran into a couple of issues
while I was setting it up
number one was I ended up with the bug
where you can end up standing like six
to ten feet below the floor for the
entire like introductory video segment
and I was just like okay well this is
really frustrating I like is it is
everything's supposed to be up there am
I supposed to be down here because
there's like a weird like golf cart next
to me but what I was actually standing
in was like a little room that's
supposed to lift the golf cart up like
it's supposed to seem like the golf cart
emerges earlier but I was just stuck
down there and I didn't come up with my
golf cart went up either so it was just
sort of confusing and then the other
issue I had was my my motion controllers
my my handheld motion controllers just
weren't picking up until I uninstalled
and reinstalled the software and like
there there were some issues with the
setup but once it's going
man is fun like the resolution does
bother me like you take off the goggles
and you see the preview window on the
screen you're just like oh man what if
it looked like that but not to the point
where the gameplay isn't immersive and
the gameplay isn't ludicrously enjoyable
so it was I tell you guys it was an
absolute it was an absolute blast I had
a lot of fun with it last night I will I
suppose I will get on with the show now
let's jump into our first topic here so
the original article is from a non tech
dot-com and Intel is slashing oh right
this was posted originally on the forum
by no one so Intel is slashing a huge
number of jobs over the rest of 2016 and
even leading into 2017 about 11% of the
total workforce 12,000 people CEO Brian
krzanich says Intel has been known as a
PC company it's time to make this
transition and push the company all the
way over to supplying chips for things
like smartphones cloud computing sensors
and other devices getting heavily into
Internet of Things and mobile products
I mean he's not saying that CPUs as you
know them are going away they're just
diversifying their portfolio and
focusing their R&amp;amp;D very clearly on those
other possible revenue streams to be
clear also sixty percent of the revenue
does still come from PCC to use but most
of the layoffs are expected to occur
inside the PC business to allow them to
focus on these other categories I really
I really hope that they know something
that AMD doesn't know about the
possibility for improving CPU
performance over the next few years here
because we've we really have seen them
de-emphasize the CPU long before there
were mass layoffs associated with it
like
this where they're kind of going okay
yep more power efficiency we're putting
more GPU on it we are not really doing a
whole lot in terms of the overall
horsepower of it keeping the the
computing experience of the desktop user
relatively stagnant while the mobile
users are getting real tangible benefits
out of each coming generation like the
better connectivity I would say even
benefits notebook users more than
desktop users because desktop users can
throw an add-in card in their system say
for example whereas laptop users these
battery life improvements these
connectivity improvements you know
things like Thunderbolt 3 make a huge
difference I mean you can only have so
many ports on something like a laptop
something like Apple's MacBook yay
whereas on a desktop you don't really
need a single port that has such high
speeds and can handle you know LAN and
sound and USB and HDMI and DisplayPort
all out of this one connection because
you could just plug all those things in
it's not really that big of a deal um
where was I going with this right so
we've we've seen this D emphasis coming
but it's frustrating because when you
look at when you look at Intel's CPUs on
the on the mainstream side like on the
LGA 1150 even if they can't increase
clock speeds dramatically and even if
they can't increase IPC that's that's
the that's the performance per clock
dramatically they could be putting more
cores on them if they opted to give us a
pure CPU rather than an APU something
with CPU and graphics built into it at
the same time they just don't they
reserve that for the high-end platform
the enthusiast and the server platform
and that's pretty much all she wrote on
that now this is really weird and I am
going to have to find out what it is
regarding by having Nick find out what
it's regarding sorry just one moment can
you take this for me fees thank you and
I'm going to move into my next topic
here
well actually we'll hold on I guess I
should give a little bit a little bit
more clarification so this is the
largest set of layoffs in 10 years since
2006 when they let 10,500 people go
profit margins in q1 were lower than
expected with a net income of 2 billion
dollars so on the revenue of 13.7
billion um yeah there I don't know I I
hope for their sake they know something
AMD doesn't know because if they're
planning to let a lot of people go on
the desktop CPU side if AMD really does
see a resurgence with Xen get some more
revenue coming in potentially allowing
them to pick up some of that talent
there could be a big opportunity for us
to have competition again due to Intel
not accidentally but making a conscious
decision to take their foot off the
pedal on the on the desktop CPU side of
things ok ok ok ok cool all right so
let's move into Intel announcing up no
yeah we already got that
oh let's move into this one this one's
fun so original article here was off of
PC perspective and basically it's
amazing how this happens but researchers
accidentally discovered nanowire based
technology that could lead to batteries
that can be charged hundreds of
thousands of times so you guys are
probably familiar with the way that
almost as though by planning phones
become obsolete
thanks to their batteries just going
through the maximum number of charge and
discharge cycles until they die like
there's lithium-ion batteries are
inherently not stable over many charge
and discharge cycles
well here we go accidental discovery
nano wires which are several thousand
times thinner than a human hair
extremely conductive and have a large
surface area to support storage and
transfer of electrons
let's highs team so this is mild at I
fixed the issue where these these tiny
wires are fragile and don't hold up well
to repeated discharging and recharging
they fix this bike holding a gold nano
wire in a manganese dioxide shell and
then placing it in a in a gel that's
like plexi guy Plexiglas to improve its
reliability again totally by accident so
Maya was apparently playing around and
she coated the whole thing with a very
thin gel layer and started to cycle it
and discovered that by using this gel
she could cycle it hundreds of thousands
of times without losing any capacity or
any power output so this was tested more
than two hundred thousand times over a
three-month span and they are reporting
the findings now I would love to see
this technology and my new smartphone
and I share I believe it was written by
Ryan shroud over at PC per but it could
have been one of their other writers but
I share their concern about this
technology ultimately being patented and
ending up in a warehouse somewhere never
to be seen again because it is a good
thing for phone manufacturers his bottom
line wise for the phone to effectively
not be usable anywhere from three to six
years after it was originally
manufactured would they want the battery
lasts forever
I don't know okay so moving along to our
next topic AMD is set to receive two
hundred and ninety three million in
fresh cash from a deal with the Chinese
government this of course raises any
number of questions I mean this comes on
on the heels of the Chinese so okay it's
kind of complicated because the Chinese
government and
and companies in China are intertwined
in a way that you wouldn't necessarily
expect if you come from like a more
Western or more capitalist society I
mean yeah but Chinese claim that
capitalism is alive and well but the
reality of it is that state funds make a
lot of the businesses that run in China
possible so in here the original article
is actually from guru 3d I'm just gonna
go ahead and pull that up so in the guru
3d article they say the Chinese
government has attempted to make CPUs
and develop their own CPU architecture
many times before they want their own
hardware and software for
government-funded institutions but they
have not yet succeeded and it looks like
AMD is going to be the beneficiary so
AMD has made it clear in their strategy
in their marketing strategy that they're
ready to customize modular CPU and SOC
or system-on-chip designs by the client
specs so similar to what they would have
done with Sony and Microsoft for the
PlayStation 4 and the Xbox one so the
deal was mentioned in their last
quarterly results and basically the deal
would involve AMD licensing its x86
processor technology and the IP related
to designing an SOC like memory
controllers input/output and caching but
possibly not their GPU technology
architecture has not been confirmed but
Forbes is claiming that it must be Zen
as their previous server CPUs hadn't had
much if any success it's actually been
it's been a while since Opteron has has
been much of a big deal this is this is
this is very this is very very
interesting I mean AMD is you could see
it as AMD getting in bed with China you
could also see it as China eventually
giving in and using using American
technology in order to
I'll catch up to what the Americans were
able to do with respect to with respect
to supercomputing and yeah I see I don't
even know if this is going to be used in
a supercomputing context to be very
clear because all we really know is that
the deal would involve licensing x86
processor technology and IP related to
building x86 architecture chips and SOC
s so I've got people saying aimed use
Americans since when okay so so there is
that significant amount of their company
is owned by overseas investment that is
true but they are American in the sense
that their headquarters is in America I
guess yeah I guess this is interesting
so I actually I don't have I don't have
a source link for this or anything like
that but AMD will not be seeding FirePro
Suri's dangit colton so they will not be
seeding their upcoming dual Hawaii card
I forget what they're even calling it I
think it's like Radeon duo Pro or pro
duo there we go
so the Radeon Pro duo will not be seeded
to conventional gaming press I'll go
ahead and show you guys on the sort of
the announcement for their
supercomputing performance to VR so what
I was pretty much told is that this this
product and I can't say anything about
it for a couple of reasons number one if
I want to get a deck about it prior to
the embargo so I can prepare any Content
that I have that I will be able to
release without an actual card I do have
to agree to the NDA and number two
because I haven't received and hit the
deck materials yet so all I know is
going off of room
so it's supposed to be dual Hawaii chips
it sounds like it's gonna be dual four
gig it'll be it'll be uh it's okay this
is off of AMD site so anticipated
selling price of fifteen hundred dollars
us and basically the reasoning that was
given to me was well it's not really
sorry did I say a dual Hawaii
sorry dual Fiji dual Fiji so it's
effectively to UM it's effectively like
two are nine like are nine fury /vx kind
of class GPUs that's that's what we can
that's what we can glean from the
details we have so far
sorry I can't believe I said dual
Hawaii's I've been running around trying
to trying to get our internet back up
and running over here and sorry I'm
struggling a little bit because I'm not
sure how much of what they told me is
stuff that is on this page I'm looking
at and how much of it is stuff that's
going to be in the deck that's going to
be nd aid so so this is good it offers a
complete solution aimed at all aspects
of the VR developer lifestyle developing
content more rapidly for killer VR
experiences while at work and playing
the latest DirectX 12 experiences at
maximum fidelity while off work so it's
no secret that dual GPU support on
recent generation games has not been
what it was even before and by the way
guys we are live something about time
zones not time zones it is 537 and we
are live so even even a year or two
years or even three years ago dual GPU
support wasn't perfect a lot of the time
it required patches from Nvidia or AMD
or previously ATI in order to function
but it's actually gotten
worse and worse and worse as time has
gone on in fact some games over the last
well even games that have been you know
you know the ones where there's like the
Nvidia logo or the AMD logo that pops up
at the beginning with you know game
works technology or whatever else it
just flat out the developers going yep
that's a lie
crossfire forget it forget it we're just
yeah it just doesn't matter it's it's
too small of a portion of customers so
for that reason the pro duo was not
realistically going to get very good
reviews from the gaming press because it
frankly just doesn't make a ton of sense
as a gaming card it's only got 4 gigs of
effective video memory because it's four
gigs per GPU that doesn't add up to
eight gigs that means four gigs it's to
presumably fairly power-hungry chips
that perform okay but not well enough to
charge $1500 for two of them and like
we've run into this before but typically
the dual GPU solution has been closer to
the thousand dollar range and not so
close to the $1,500 range where you
can't just kind of go okay you know like
here this is a fun experiment let's just
fire up new egg shop AMD Radeon fury X
no new Wacom is fine okay I don't Wow
Wow the world's most boring sale
monitors and Printers unless you're
shopping for a monitor or a printed in
which case what just happened to my
search result Oh new egg anyway oh okay
so about six hundred $29 so you're
paying this huge premium to have a card
that does save you on PCI Express
apparently 2295 x2 launched at $1500
yeah that's a good point but how many
units did 295x2 sell like this is a this
is a this is a dinosaur the Radeon Pro
dual in a gaming sense is a dinosaur
because you can get to fury X's
for 1,300 bucks after taxes kind of
thing so unless you desperately need
those two slots
what are you even what are you even
doing and if you desperately need those
two slots why don't you just water cool
water cool a couple of fury axes I mean
that actually pays for your water blocks
right there so yeah it's gonna be
power-hungry it's gonna be super
expensive so basically they're kind of
going okay yeah it's for developers and
I don't really I don't really I guess
what I don't really get at this point I
understand why they're not seating it to
reviewers because it wouldn't have
gotten a positive review from us it
wouldn't have gotten a positive review
from probably anyone they'd say you know
it's it's always that sugar-coated
conclusion right this is the ultimate
graphics card for AMD enthusiasts who
want the highest performance single AMD
card see you go like you go like this
this sliver of this slice of the
available market if people who are
interested in graphics cards and that is
pretty much all that is left for someone
who for for gaming purposes might be
interested in a radio and pro duel I'll
be interested to see what they can come
up with in terms of value ads for the
pro duo that would make it makes sense
for developers but I just have a hard
time imagining what would make it better
for developers than just picking up a
couple of theories or a couple of theory
X's alpha 17 X in the chat this is a
this is a really good this is a really
good point I'm a developer I use what
the end user would be using so I know
what the crap I'm something twitch chat
moves too fast I mean that is uh that is
a really really great point um and
depending on what kind of development
you're doing like if you're working on
digital assets you might be interested
in something like a fire pro or
something like a Quadro card but in
those cases you'd want a lot more than
four gigs of VRAM per GPU so I still
don't understand why they're even
releasing this card that's the question
I understand why they don't want people
to review it I don't understand why they
even kept it in development after all
this time because it's like it's no
secret that V
directx12 is where we're headed and dual
GPU something of a dinosaur at this
point I mean Nvidia didn't even bother
do you think do you think Nvidia
couldn't have built a dual 980 card come
on they totally could have done it you
think they couldn't have built a dual
980 card with eight gigs of ram per GPU
like that they managed to build an MX M
they managed to put a 980 in a laptop
the power efficiency was there the
thermal output was there they were just
like yeah why bother I mean Titan Z was
such a flop I mean the price that
presumably it had to be in order to
build it because they had they had lots
of time to drop the price on it and just
go okay yeah we'll just take less margin
on it and sell some more units like the
price it must have cost to make it just
made it untenable so yeah I mean to me
this is kind of like the the final swan
song for dual GPUs on one card outside
of outside of you know professional like
scientific like high-performance
computing based cards that you might
expect to find in a in a like a huge
server farm somewhere so hopefully
Polaris is the answer and and we can all
look forward to that hey Brandon can you
uh help me with something for a minute
very very quickly by running thank you
can you find out what this is and direct
it to the appropriate place it may be
something quite important all right so
this is a cool piece of technology the
original poster here is aa Ming and the
original article here is from the verge
this is a cool way to use technology
this is a mosquito killer billboard that
is targeting mosquitoes carrying the
Zika virus in Brazil now if you have
been if you've been watching the
development of Zika in the news you're
probably aware that
it is a huge concern not necessarily for
perfectly healthy people but especially
if you're pregnant
Zika could be a major problem because it
can cause I believe it's um it's either
macro or micro I'm gonna go with
microcephaly which is a condition where
your brain depending on whether it's
macro or micro I think it's micro where
your where your head is super small
which causes all kinds of developmental
problems so what the what the bill so
Zika hasn't has been a problem in warmer
climate areas jungle areas because it's
spread by mosquitoes it's actually
transmitted sexually as well but it has
been a huge problem in Brazil so this
technology is apparently using this like
carbon dioxide and lactic acid solution
to mimic human breathing and sweat and
then zapping the bugs killing them so it
can actually lure insects within a
radius of up to two and a half
kilometers this is something I've always
wondered about like how do mosquitoes
find us so there you go apparently it's
by smell
now to be clear always wondered about
doesn't mean like it was a burning
desire because I could have just googled
it it's just something that kind of like
wow so it can lure insects within a
radius of two and a half kilometers and
um let's see do and kill them but there
are some concerns that have been raised
so two of these billboards have been
installed in Rio de Janeiro and they're
using technical specifications that
they've actually published for free
online by Chris Jackson Jackson ejection
Jackson a pest control expert at the
University of Southampton told the BBC
that the billboard could inadvertently
cause more people to be bitten depending
on where it is placed and just give me
one second Brendon who did you give that
phone to okay King
bring him back here thank you
so I've actually got a pretty cool
graphic for how it works here I'm just
gonna go ahead and pull this up on the
screen so a device spreads in the air
and a solution containing the lactic
acid and co2 okay so it spreads in the
air this solution the combination of the
two substances attracts mosquitoes that
this claims the distance of up to four
kilometers fluorescent lights enhance
this attraction facilitating the
approximation and I think they need an
approach of the mosquito and then as the
ADEs flies on average four feet above
the ground the catch mechanism was
designed to be there it draws the
mosquito into the panel and after being
stuck the mosquito dies dehydrated so it
doesn't zap them in the sense that it
like those like those awesome paddle bug
zapper things but it does kill them
eventually which i guess is is all we
can all we can really ask hey Brandon
where is he okay did you tell him to
move quickly I can't hold on I'm
streaming from that phone I'm dropping
frames he needs to get over here right
away
thank you sorry all right so this was
originally posted by Yami Yuki senpai
and this is pretty much the worst news
ever
la eco formerly who formerly went by the
name of lit CV Lee TV
revealed their low to range of
smartphones none of which have a three
and a half millimeter jack so instead
the phone supports USB type-c digital
headphones through the charging port
they also launched a USBC earphones Q
and a USB C headphone skew to accompany
it so let's have a look at the original
article over on
Android Authority which I would I would
love to click on but Google talks is
being such a dirt bike now and making it
hard for me to click stuff there we go
so after all the rumors about Apple
launching a phone with no headphone jack
it turns out that an Android phone maker
is going to be the first one I really I
get I get a kick out of it
what are they why why what is the point
like I get that they're kind of going oh
yeah well you know we're gonna build
this ecosystem with like earphones and
headphones that work with it but it's
like such a hassle like what if I don't
know say for example you were sitting
down to stream LaLanne show and you
wanted to quickly plug your your
headphones that you normally use with
your phone into your streaming computer
so you can check audio levels it's
alright Oh bummer it's USB type-c I
guess it's just not gonna work with
anything and it's one thing if you were
to release like some kind of a killer
pair of headphones that rounds up the
ecosystem and makes it make a ton of
sense but that's not yeah that's not
gonna help if you're just some random
Android maker and your headphones and
earphones to be clear haven't heard them
but are probably terrible like probably
just just awful let's go ahead and see
if we can find any pictures of the
device that would be that'd be super
cool I mean to see if pocket now has
pictures up on their site but yeah I
mean there's really not much else to say
it's not it's not a product that I would
be that I would be especially interested
in one way or the other
and unfortunately the pocket now article
is not loading for me at the moment but
yeah speaking of products that I'm not
particularly interested in this was
originally posted by lots of
unexplainable lag on the forum and the
original article here is from Mac rumors
calm
but Apple has updated not the MacBook
Air not the product we were actually
hoping that they would update you know
one that has enough thinness but maybe
not quite as much thinness but you know
good battery life but maybe not as a
good battery life but actually has ports
on it no no they didn't give the MacBook
Air Retina display so it really does
look like the MacBook Air is is a is a
foregone conclusion at this point I
think it's a done deal it's gone they
have updated the 12-inch MacBook so now
it has skylake CPU options a longer
battery life and a rose gold option so
six generation skylake dual core Core M
processors up to 1.3 gigahertz HD
graphics 515 delivering 25% faster
performance for all the games that you
will presumably be playing on your
macbook faster PCI Express base of
storage okay I can't complain about that
an additional hour of battery life
faster 1866 megahertz memory gold full
addition to the existing gold silver and
Space Gray colors unfortunately Apple in
its infinite wisdom did not feel it was
necessary to add any ports to it so
while I wasn't gonna buy one anyway I
find that frustrating just because for
the sake of the people buying this
product it would be it would be
considerate of Apple to you know care
about them enough to give them some
ports to use you know man I just I feel
bad for the Apple people Apple people
buying this
yeah all right
uh-oh more car scandals the opie here is
num lock 21 I'm gonna see if refreshing
Google Docs helps here this is driving
me crazy it's doing that weird thing
where there's like the line you're
trying to click on and you put your
mouse there and it clicks like an inch
higher or something like that yeah there
we go
reloading the page hub so euro news.com
has the original article about
Mitsubishi Motors faking their fuel
economy tests they actually got raided
like go figure raided so their shares
plunged on Thursday following an
admission that they faked fuel economy
data on car sold in Japan they ended up
losing 3.2 billion in market value over
a mere three days they apologized on
Wednesday saying they will make a
sincere effort to make amends to car
owners and Transport Minister the
Transport Minister of Japan wants
Mitsubishi to look at the possibility of
buying back the cars that could be even
more costly than what Volkswagen went
through Wow Mitsubishi will also have to
pay subsidies granted to consumers if
data shows its cars do not meet the
necessary fuel economy standards I mean
I don't know I don't know what the
takeaway here is part of the takeaway is
these companies are bad and they did
really bad things and you know I don't
know if that makes some bad people
sometimes good people do bad things but
faking fuel economy ratings is pretty
bad I mean you're lying to your
customers you're lying to your
government you are polluting the economy
aren't polluting the economy you're
polluting the environment more than you
said you were like these these targets
exist for a reason we're trying to
reduce our ecological impact but with
that said it also raises questions about
the about whether
introducing laws governing how much
you know co2 or how much are governing
the emissions that cars can output
whether that's actually the solution or
if you have to do something else I mean
I've argued for a long time that here in
Vancouver public transit is basically
unusable if you have a job public
transit is is pretty difficult to use
Vancouver is such a suburban sprawl it
just it just spreads and all in all
directions rather than building up like
many other cities have and our
infrastructure is just awful outside of
the of the urban core to the point where
something that is a half an hour drive
could easily take two two and a half
hours on a bus and if you value your
time at all like you could even just
work another job in the four hours of
commuting that you save per day in order
to have a car and not just sit around on
the bus so rather than just kind of tell
companies hey you have to have lower
emissions
you know maybe making changes that make
it easier for people to use mass transit
would be a better solution but of course
that's very easy for me to sit here and
say I mean I don't actually have to run
the country thank goodness alright
Oh more bad news posted by Phoenix
arising on the forum and the original
article here is from the CNN Money
Microsoft's profits fall by 25 percent
not an insignificant amount sort of a
sort of a lousy quarter but not all of
this is necessarily entirely their fault
so q1 2015 5 billion dollars profit q1
2016 3.8 billion but part of the reason
that it fell 25% was due to a higher
than expected tax rate and a strong US
dollar okay sales are down from 20
points 21.7 to 20 point five billion
sales for consumer versions grew 15%
Enterprise version declined 11% for
Windows although this I don't know could
have something to do with that we got a
consumer version of Windows that was not
accompanied by
server version I mean sir Server 2016 is
nowhere to be found yet if anything it's
probably kind of happy but you know
enterprise sales will need a client a
little bit like I personally would be
trying to put off a server purchase
until Server 2016 shows up if I had any
say in the matter at this point
office 365 consumer base reached twelve
point four million in 2001 2015 and grew
to twenty two point two million in 2016
I will say I contributed to that
I love office 365 as your is up Xbox is
up so basically yeah OS is OS is not
growing the way they would like and they
were taxed higher than they thought I'm
glad they're at least paying taxes so
you know good guy Microsoft I guess
anyway well so we got
this is interesting so original a post
tears from Engadget the Canadian
province of Quebec contemplates
mandating home evie charging stations
expects a decision by the start of this
summer I don't really understand what
they're hoping to accomplish by that I
mean I can see how investing in
infrastructure throughout the province
like public infrastructure could help
the adoption of an e V because in my
mind like as someone considering
purchasing an electric vehicle I would
love to buy an electric vehicle it's
just not really in my price range right
now but as someone considering it after
I've spent the 25 to 30 thousand dollars
on an e V you know hundreds more or even
you know low thousands more for the
charging station is not the end of the
world I mean you think about it like a
phone like if you walk in you buy a $500
phone are you that concerned about the
$30 charger at the same time like I
consider it part of the purchase part of
the decision that someone buying that
vehicle would have to make so this
really and and and my decision as far as
what the government can do to help would
have more to do with mandating
businesses or installing these charging
stations in public places than to do
with whether or not I have to buy a
charging station to put in my garage so
this again smacks of the government
thinking that just introducing a
regulation is going to somehow address
some kind of a problem and change
consumer behavior at no cost to
themselves because basically they're
just making builders stomach it and
they're making consumers who don't
necessarily want one and aren't ready
for one and could have easily waited
another five years when they were ready
for a new car and bought one then when
it's cheaper and they're making them
foot the bill instead of just investing
in the infrastructure themselves
see oh yeah yeah
speaking of investing you know who
invested in our trip to PAX East yes my
friends our friends from oh that uh oh
my lower third is gone hopefully I can
find my lower third come on lower third
whoo let's see what path it's supposed
to be in of course of course mousing
over it didn't help and of course I do
understand why that's not working and
there is basically nothing I can do
about it right now
so our sponsors were Logitech G and
discord so Logitech G you're probably
familiar with you can check out their
new G 900 Wireless Gaming Mouse over at
amazon.com I will link that in the
twitch chat this is the one that Luke
went all the way to Switzerland to check
out and basically see how it is that
Logitech validated it to run as
effortlessly and as stable E as a wired
mouse even though it doesn't have a wire
pretty freakin cool little piece of
technology they're also showing off what
they're calling the great wall of
Logitech G's using their g8n keyboards
so they created original 8-bit content
to show on the wall through the use of
their keyboards LEDs you can actually
find a short clip here I'll try and fire
this up for you guys here yeah there you
go so this is on this is on invidious
Twitter pretty freakin cool it's hard to
even tell that that's not a proper
display from here like look at it
they're all keyboards that is awesome
which like pretty much everything in my
life right now reminds me of the HTC
vive there's a really cool minigame from
valve that has you use the controller as
a ship kind of like an old arcade style
you know up scrolling like spaceship
shooter game except the controller is
the ship so you can like move around in
3d space and like fire it bad guys
freakin freakin sick um so if you're
watching this on youtube there should be
a full video by the way linked in the
video description so you can check that
out also sponsoring our trip to the show
and this is a brand new sponsor is
discord it's the all in one voice and
text chat for gamers it's free secure
and works on both desktop and your phone
they are promising to never make you pay
to use it they plan to monetize in the
future with optional cosmetics like
themes thicker packs and sound packs so
similar to like what someone like a
swift key was doing where they actually
switched from a paid model to a free
model their encrypted server to class
they are encrypting server to client
communications to keep your IP address
safe that sounds pretty cool and they
have built-in DDoS protection with
automatic server failover
they promise minimal serve CPU usage and
it's optimized so your games performance
doesn't tanked when you use it they
claim it takes 10 seconds to set up and
doesn't require drivers or any weird
setup config so if you guys want to try
it out I've got a link over here that
I'm gonna post in the twitch chat or if
you're watching this on YouTube then you
can go ahead and you can check that out
at the link in the video description but
it looks pretty freakin good I know that
Nick and Colton actually did their
conference call with discord about this
deal on discord so yeah I mean what else
would ease it's like you know hey do you
wanna I don't know use the telephone be
like telephones ancient technology Oh
what else we got here other sponsor
lynda.com if you somehow are not
familiar with lynda.com by this point
then I will tell you about it lynda.com
is used by millions of people around the
world they have more than 3000 courses
available and they are taught by experts
in the topics of things like web
development photography visual design
video editing business productivity
application use pretty much whatever you
could want you Excel WordPress Photoshop
whatever you could want to kickstart
your hobby or your career they have new
courses that are added every week and
they've got a lot of new tools that
they've added since
we have been since we've been doing
these pots for them actually now that I
think about it things like being able to
download the videos and view them on the
bus when you don't necessarily want to
eat up your data connection on iOS and
Android the ability to skim along a
transcript of the course and then just
click to a point on the script and then
have the video pick up at that spot the
ability to create playlists so you can
learn alongside your friends and follow
a curriculum together and they're
offering a 10 day free trial which gives
you access to every course on lynda.com
for 10 days all-you-can-eat with plans
starting after that at only 25 bucks a
month so check it out all right what
else we got here you've actually got a
fair number of fair number of topics
Microsoft has finally ended production
of the Xbox 360 so there you have it
originally posted on Kotaku if you
wanted to buy an Xbox 360 before today
was the time well there'll probably
still be some lunch elves but ten and a
half years ten and a half years ago the
Xbox 360 launched and we are finally
finally rid of it
Microsoft's phil spencer wrote a few
paragraphs about its success saying xbox
360 means a lot to everyone in Microsoft
and while we've had an amazing run the
realities of manufacturing a product
over a decade old are starting to creep
up on us which is why we've made the
decision to stop manufacturing new Xbox
360 consoles we will continue to sell
existing inventory with availability
varying by country xbox live will remain
active as will the Xbox 360s various
stores and online services and the Xbox
one is actually adding support for
backward ways adding backwards
compatibility support for some 360 games
so there you have it there you have it
the Xbox 360 is finally no more I'm
actually probably gonna pick up a
handful of Xbox 360 controllers before
like getting peripherals for dying
console madness hat
I want to get a couple that are in good
condition because it's still my favorite
controller I really don't like the shape
of the DualShock and I really do prefer
it to the Xbox one controller so there
you go let's see what else we got hmm oh
this is interesting original article
here is from a non tech comm WD is
introducing WD gold hard drives they
have added yet another color it's
available in capacities from four to six
to eight terabytes and effectively
pretty much replaces the SE lineup oh
that's funny and pretty much four places
their existing se lineup which was kind
of like like a high capacity enterprise
but not as expensive as re not quite as
expense not quite as high performance as
re so basically the the color branding
is almost complete I'm surprised they
called it gold I would have thought they
would save gold for our II but maybe
they're gonna call that platinum or
something I don't know it's tuned
similarly 2 WD red drives rated for 24/7
use and workloads of up to 550 terabytes
a year with a five-year warranty cool ah
this is this is just kind of funny this
is originally original post here is over
on cbc.ca rust players outraged after
half of them given female avatars in
some kind of attempt to appease sjw's I
suppose now this wouldn't be that big of
an issue if they hadn't been changed
without the players even being notified
and permanently so your player just boom
they didn't fell under a feature that
randomly makes your character a man or a
woman
they actually randomized features for
your current permanent character like
skin color Lin length and even penis
size so developers Gary Numan and Taylor
olds expected this backlash and
addressed it on their community dev vlog
that's great we understand this is a
sore subject for a lot of people we
understand that you may now be a gender
that you don't identify with in real
life we understand this causes you to
suppress and fix you not want to play
the game anymore technically nothing has
changed
since half the population was already
living with those feelings the only
difference is that whether you feel like
this is now decided by your steam ID
instead of your real-life gender this is
really just the first pass of an ongoing
rework of the player model I'll continue
to add variations over the coming weeks
which means you're probably not stuck
with your new face forever we've got a
decent synced workflow between the
assets I make in ZBrush and the assets
you'll see in-game now so it opens up a
lot of scope to easily add or change
features without a great deal of
technical faffing in between what so we
heard that lots of people you know don't
identify with gender X or Y or some
combination of the two and that makes
them unhappy so we thought as a game
developer we take our customers and we
would have them experience that on some
scale because we something okay
ah
we've got more details about the
PlayStation 4 K which we don't know if
it's the confirmed name I don't know if
we talked about some of this stuff last
week I believe we actually did but we've
got a handy dandy little chart this time
so I can go ahead and fire that up for
you guys so eight Jaguar cores eight
more Jaguar cores we'll know exactly the
same number of eight jaguar cores in
fact same architecture but higher clock
speed ok GCN better GCN ok higher
clocked more compute units memory looks
like it's got a bandwidth increase but
is actually still the same eight gigs so
there you go yep this is cool so this
was originally posted by strider 721 on
the forum the original article here is
from the verge counter-strike hacked to
run on android phones this is cool
now to be clear this is not csgo this is
kind of strike 1.6 but how cool is that
right
play this love it
oh man so let's get some details here so
this is the work of programmer that a
Lebec Oh merav who's experienced in
making old PC games run on Android he's
created touchscreen controls for the
game so to get it to work on your
Android device you download the sash X
ash it's XA sh 3d software have the
games on your steam account to copy the
files across and the port does
apparently support peripherals which is
pretty cool because with an on-the-go
cable I have actually tested this with
an OTG cable and a film that supports
OTG and just a normal USB hub you can
plug in pretty much whatever you could
possibly want powered USB hub otherwise
you are definitely going to have issues
running like you know large 104 key like
RGB backlit keyboards so I think that
pretty much does it for the win show
thank you to all of you who went ahead
and stuck with me through the technical
difficulties on the show today really do
appreciate it I will see you guys next
week
same bat-time same bat-channel
actually we will I see you guys next
week I may be traveling next week we
have a lot of like a lot of the team is
traveling a lot
no I wait what yeah Brandon's like gone
forever yeah Linus and Edie are in San
Francisco until yes next Friday so I'll
see if I'm remoting in or I'll see if
I'm not but if I don't Luke will be
hosting the show cuz he'll be back by
then this is the problem with like you
tell people take your vacation and then
no one does it and then you tell people
look you're not gonna be able to take it
in q4 cuz it's busy and then everyone
just takes off mind you most of this is
work stuff actually only Brandon's
taking vacation cuz he's not a team
player you heard me all right see you
