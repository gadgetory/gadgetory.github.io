dangers of backing just any random
Kickstarter or IndieGoGo campaign and
swimming in childlike naivety and blind
optimism over 2500 people backed geebo a
social robot companion that the
creator's Gebo Inc promised would do
everything from making video calls to
reading bedtime stories and this was
long before the Google assistant or
Amazon echo existed now for my part it
was pretty obvious that G Bo was too
ambitious to be anything but an enormous
belly flop onto a bed of hot coals but
coming off of the success of my then
recent slaying of the Brunton hydrogen
reactor I was looking for a way to up
the ante I was looking for something
even dumber to roast so I bought one
three and a half years later my very own
g bo finally showed up was it worth the
wait was it worth nine hundred US
dollars of course not don't be a G Bo
this video was brought to you by be
quiet the dark bass 700 is extremely
versatile and features RGB LED lighting
plus a tempered glass side panel window
and more check it out at the link below
looks-wise Gebo is kind of like the
illegitimate love child of Pixar's luxo
jr. and Eva from wall-e he and G bow is
a he stands 11 inches tall
with a glossy plastic finish on a body
that is essentially a stack of rotating
blocks that allows him to move with hey
G bow spin around don't mind if I do
amazing naturalness this is something
that the team there did really well and
as you can see his movements are fluid
nearly silent and made even more
lifelike by his awareness of his
environment
geebo is equipped with six microphones
that he uses to orient his face toward
you when you speak to him and we've even
seen him turn towards the sound of an
opening door to see who entered the room
with the two cameras at the top of his
face one of them is for taking photos
and the other is for depth perception
and facial recognition yes
facial recognition G Bo can be trained
to recognize up to 15 people casually
including their names in his responses
wishing them happy birthday or randomly
interrupting their lives to rattle off a
fun little fact sometimes it really does
feel like he's looking at you which
makes it all the more troubling that
there is no way to disable his
microphones or cameras other than just
shutting him down which you do by
scrolling to the settings on the
touchscreen portion of his face that
tragically isn't oullette giving it a
gray glow that leads many people to see
his face as two beauty little eyes and a
giant mouth rather than as a single
darting and blinking eyeball one
surprising feature is that he has an
onboard battery so you or the kids can
unplug him and plop him down wherever
you might need him nice okay but what
could you actually need your chubby Robo
buddy for well compared to other smart
speakers like Google home and Amazon
echo
shockingly little Gebo can't play a
YouTube video or a song from Spotify he
can't record a video or audio clip
he can't read you a bedtime story he
can't sing you a lullaby he doesn't
support personal calendars and if you
tell him hey Gebo repeat after me or to
execute your last command again I can't
remember what I just said my short-term
memory will get better in the future
though ok then I mean at least it can
answer the kinds of questions we used to
love firing it Siri back in 2011 right
what's the weather outside how far away
is the moon the distance from the earth
to the moon is about three hundred
seventy four thousand six things like
that well yes and no Gebo has limited
resources for finding answers to your
skill testing questions including
Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha so that's
good but also Bing so he doesn't always
get the answers right
hey ji bow who is the president the
president is it common titled for the
head of state and most Republic's Haji
Bo who is the president of the United
States of America the President of the
United States is the head of state and
head of government of the United States
of America wrong speaking of things G Bo
can do but can't do well the news unlike
Google home which offers a laundry list
of news recordings from major
publications Jibo only offers news from
The Associated Press which might even be
passable if he didn't read it out in his
own voice according to the Associated
Press
Japan CEO and ambassador provecho says
the international community must keep
the pressure up so no one wants to
listen to a talking computer for more
than like two sentences tops speaking of
speaking I've got kind of mixed feelings
about gee Bo's voice the sound is more
robotic than most of his competitors but
his tone and inflections are sometimes
industry-leading in there
naturalness though this is usually only
the case when he's giving you a canned
answer bringing us then to G Bo's
personality which somehow seems to match
his physical form pretty much perfectly
he's quirky er than the more pragmatic
assistants that were used to Haji Bo
what's your favorite book I really love
instruction manuals there are so many
it's hard to choose one favorite and I
wished him a good morning after 12
o'clock once and he replied sure
I guess it's morning somewhere I may be
wrong but I don't think it's morning but
he still doesn't feel like a social
companion because even though he
sometimes looks at me while I'm sitting
at my desk and recognizes my face and
even says hello to me before I say
anything he doesn't listen for my
response or carry out even the most
rudimentary conversations he only
responds to commands so he's the most
animated lifelike robot we've seen yet
and yes I'm including those creepy
uncanny valley BOTS like Sophie but the
fact is although somehow time missed
this he's almost completely useless
especially when you consider the pitch
from the original crowdfunding video I
mean yes he does have some smart-home
functionality thanks to if this then
that integration but it's very basic and
yes in theory his abilities could expand
with over-the-air updates and a
developer SDK that's coming out in the
new year but honestly what kind of
developers would be stupid enough to
invest their time in a platform with
such a small user base when there are an
estimated 20 million Amazon echo devices
out there with AXA realistically it was
a good idea the world is headed towards
digital assistance in a big way but G Bo
Inc tried to do too much with too little
and their only hope for a return on the
last few years of their lives at this
point is to be bought out by one of the
big guys just like my only hope for a
return on this stupid purchase is to
the whole team here sign it and put it
on eBay in hopes that one of you out
there is an avid collector of ridiculous
crowdfunding rubbish Haji buh twerk
never gets old man
Klaus gonna throw away $900 three years
ago I really wish I had that on Bitcoin
on the subject of things that aren't as
much of a waste of money as this thing
