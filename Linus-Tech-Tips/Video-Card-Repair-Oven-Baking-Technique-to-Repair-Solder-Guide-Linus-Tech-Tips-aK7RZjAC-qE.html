the temperature's going up pretty
quickly here well it was until I looked
at it and tried to point out to somebody
there it goes finally so I want to show
you the preparation process that goes on
here first of all you put some aluminum
foil I should mention certainly not the
one who discovered this and there seems
to be a lot of debate about how long to
bake it for I'm going to try this guy
for seven minutes the general rule is
that anything over 10 to 12 minutes is
probably too much and anything under 5
minutes is probably not enough I have
some aluminum foil balls on all four
corners of the video card holding it up
you don't want it to make direct contact
with your baking sheet or any other
surface inside the oven and so as soon
as that gets up to a 385 we're going to
go ahead and try this out so there's the
card inside the oven it's kind of hard
to see but I think you get the point
it's in there my timer is going so once
that runs down I'm going to go ahead and
remove it and find out if the card works
when you're removing it from the oven
you want to be really careful bearing in
mind the whole point of this process was
to turn all of the solder points on the
card to liquid so if you go and move it
too fast or flex the card then you're
probably just asking for it to be even
more dead than it was before okay I just
took it out and it's actually fairly
evident by the shininess of the solder
points that are visible that the solder
did indeed melt can't really get it to
focus right now but so my hope is that
whatever was ailing it will be fixed and
everything will be well reconnected and
I guess we'll test it so I know what
happens I let it cool for a while and
off we go okay this is the moment of
truth a card is in the system so let's
find out if we get a display on the
monitor or not so far it is looking like
or not
well there you have it so I was not able
to fix my 8800 GTS with this method but
that doesn't mean that it won't work if
the problem actually is something
becoming d soldered so there must be
something else wrong with this card that
is not related to that and it's time to
throw it away thank you for checking out
