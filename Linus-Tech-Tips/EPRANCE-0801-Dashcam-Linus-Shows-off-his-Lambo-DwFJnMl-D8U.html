safe and cautious Drive
remember when pulling up to an
intersection behind another car leave a
safe following distance in case their
vehicle accidentally rolls backwards oh
good heavens that car collided with me
it wasn't moving at all you guys saw
that excuse me good sir I believe your
car rolled backwards down the heavily
right:0 because your car ran into mine
called the rear ender for any reason get
it in your head well well normally the
car in the back would be at fault in a
situation such as this which is now
which is why they so call that normally
right but had anyone seen this accident
they would have observed your car oh no
one saw this accident - it doesn't
 matter because that's how this
 works
well there's damage to the front of my
don't want hair damage on the back of
your car well I have a dashcam you see I
have an injury you have an injury which
which which you're gonna have to pay for
it I'm gonna pay for your injury because
you ran into mice oh man Oh cuz you read
it to my car Oh : um but you do
understand that no one will believe that
I ran into your car oh can you call can
you call anyone oh my heart
the CM storm SF 17 uses a massive 18
centimeter fan to cool your gaming
notebook and it adds a four port USB hub
click now to learn more alright that was
fun but why does this video exist mostly
as a PSA for why aside from us all
needing more footage of meteor showers
in Russia everyone should have a - can
because if you could choose who you get
into car accidents with the life would
be simple but because you can't the odds
that the other individual is a complete
asshat are pretty good so for that
reason back in December I was looking
for whatever gave me solid image quality
on the cheap this he pranced dashcam has
about a billion reviews on Amazon it has
all the features I need like 1080p
recording audio recording and so I
figured what the heck I'll order one and
if it's great I'll let my peeps know and
if it sucks then I'll let my peeps know
so here we go the tour of this product
is pretty straightforward
on the side is the power button which
you usually won't use since you'll want
to plug it into your car and set it to
record whenever it gets power on the
front light goes in to the lens here
sound goes into the microphone here and
there's a speaker for playback then you
flip it around and there's a little
display to show you what sort of stuff
was captured by the lens and that also
gives you a real-time preview of
whatever you're capturing power in can
be handled a couple of different ways
the top USB port is on the unit that
comes with a surprisingly good adhesive
and can be detached from the camera once
you've mounted it to the windshield it
serves as power for both the camera and
the optional GPS module that lives
inside it which I didn't bother with but
is available for an extra 10 bucks the
other USB port up here can power just
the camera or it can be used to pull
footage off of the optional onboard
memory or in my case the 16 gig microSD
card that holds about 3 hours of footage
at 1080p definitely enough to capture
you know the moment if something crappy
happens while you are behind the wheel
on the bottom we find the microSD slot I
just mentioned before as well as a mini
HDMI port that can be used to playback
footage on a larger screen if you don't
want to use the one that's built in
speaking of the built-in screen the 3
buttons next to it are not really very
well labeled and each have at least a
couple different functions for reviewing
footage navigating the menus and
stopping and starting recording so good
luck with that like sometimes you hold
it down sometimes you press it yeah I
don't know all right so here's my setup
the unit does get a little bit warm
while it's in operation but you know
nothing nothing out of the ordinary so
basically I'd mounted it in my car
by putting it out of the way behind my
rear view mirror and then I ran a wire
down to my little energizer inverter
unit here that powers up a bunch of USB
ports should you so desire and also has
an AC outlet but if you don't have one
of those it does come with one of the
cigarette lighter adapter so it actually
has quite a long wire on us you
shouldn't have any difficulty doing that
once it's on there you just go ahead and
make sure the 135 degree wide angle lens
is getting all the right stuff by
adjusting it a little bit up or down and
then that's basically it
I mean it's funny to me that in the
manual they tell you to mount it away
from dust haha not in this car and I
would have direct sunlight and I'm just
like okay it's a windshield not a Sun
shield and if it was a Sun shield then I
better not get a dashcam because any
footage of the kinds of accidents I'd be
getting into wouldn't work in my favor
but the overall conclusion wise I guess
this product is pretty straightforward I
haven't tried other dash cams I'd love
to hear your comments letting me know
which ones are your favorites but I
don't plan to replace this one anytime
soon because the footage looks pretty
good even in crummy conditions like my
poorly lit bedroom with just a weaksauce
bedside lamp and while the onboard menu
system isn't perfect like at all it's
actually fairly comprehensive with just
about every option I could imagine
myself wanting from resolution selection
to manual or auto ISO and white balance
settings to selecting whether to record
continuously over the previous footage
to protect everything on the SD card and
just give an error when it's full or to
just protect certain clips like if I
just got in an accident I want to
protect that clip and then keep
recording over all the rest of the stuff
you can do all that stuff so aside from
being a little bit difficult to navigate
especially the first time without the
manual overall of fun if I paid what I
pay
for this which I did then I'd be pretty
pleased which I am so thank you for
watching guys the link for where to buy
this product is in the video description
below the like dislike and share buttons
which you should use accordingly also in

thanks again for watching as always
don't forget to subscribe for more
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos and since we're here in my car I
would like to take this opportunity to
dispel the myth once and for all that I
Drive a Lamborghini
in fact this is my car it's a 2003 Honda
Civic that aside from not having you
know wing style doors does not actually
even have air conditioning you can see
that button is uh is it empty on this
particular model it has five discreet
brakes in the windshield abashed in
front left side that actually leaks
water so I have to have newspaper on the
floor of my car to soak up the water as
it comes in and that's that's all just
aside from it just being like generally
pretty horrible so there you go guys
Barna Cleese and J's $0.02 have been
spreading rumors and lies about the car
that I Drive and this is in fact this is
in fact it I do I do not drive or own a
Lamborghini
unfortunately so there now we've put
that to rest once and for all I'll show
you an injury that on your dashcam</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
