from gigabyte it is the gigabyte MIB men
in black tea three one four oh I'm sorry
no this is the monitor integrated box my
bad I got it wrong I'm sorry anyway
this I know what I'm going into this
completely cold I have no idea what this
is but it appears to be a computer case
and then it has like a little stand on
the top which I'm gonna go ahead and
assume ends in a VESA mount so that you
can mount a monitor to the top of a
little desktop computer great for
embedded applications or if you need
like a little POS terminal for a retail
store or something like that all right
so here we go oh yes that's exactly what
it is so you have a gigabyte case you
got a little stand attached to it and
then you can attach so you could put a
touch screen monitor whatever kind of
monitor you need just like that that's
kind of cool so here we go this is
mm-hmm
well let's have a look at the back first
so let's see the hinge design so it has
a hinge lock cover flexible hinge
enabling monitor horizontal and vertical
adjustment it has cable and cord
management it is basis standard so 17 to
22 inch recommended monitors with a
hundred by a hundred millimeter or 75 by
75 millimeter monitor holes okay on the
back or on the the case designed so it
is an ITX case supporting a slim optical
drive although for most people buying a
case like this you probably wouldn't
even have a DVD drive it would just be
set up once and then sit there forever
it has an integrated power supply on the
thumbscrews for more convenience
assembly and it has a 60 millimeter
cooling film so this is space-saving
that's their whole pitch by replacing
the monitor stand with a computer I'll
buy that okay so here's the overall
specifications of the case it's made of
ABS plastic on the front vessel it's
available in black its weighs four
kilograms okay one three and a half inch
internal drive and then you've got two
USB 2.0 ports on the front as well as
one HD audio I don't think this is
sealed because it's like it's a sample
product so it's not really this isn't
exactly how it'll come at retail but I
believe this one also has
motherboard inside that I'm supposed to
have a look at as well so we're just
gonna just gonna kind of go and find out
what happens here will have this
adventure together so I'm gonna take out
the card good thing it's falling apart
okay so here is the vase amount so this
sits up at the end of the arm which is
here oh this is kind of cool so the case
by default doesn't actually like you're
not required to have the the mounting
arm on it that's just an optional
accessory that it looks like um where
does this attach okay this is kind of
smart so the case here
alright so let's put the case aside for
now I guess and let's have a look at
sort of the accessory focus principle so
here we've got a manual which may or may
not be a final manual because like I
said this is a sample hardware so here
we go so they give us a little
introduction to the the case structure
itself so here's your hinge cable cord
management kay we already covered most
of this and then they give you all they
give you a little installation guide
so they show you how to remove the top
cover install the motherboard install
the hard drive and slim optical drive
and then that's pretty much all that's
involved because when you're putting in
an ITX motherboard it'll have onboard
video onboard sound so you need to
install the CPU and RAM on the
motherboard and other than that it's
pretty much grabbing go so then you
install okay here's the installation of
the LCD monitor to the case you connect
the hinge onto the chassis and then
mount the monitor before adjusting the
angle of the hinge so let me see the
back of the case is over here so these
two thumb screws right here come out and
then that is where you actually attach
the hinge arm so it slides over here I
cameraman look up here so it slides into
place at the front and then you could
also use um there you go clips right in
you could also use like some kind of
security screws at the back you could
replace the default ones and then you
could make it so that your employees or
customers can't remove the I'm not
actually going to put this in now
because I want to open up the case but
you could make it so that they can't
remove the motherboard from or the
the monitor from the case that's kind of
cool
and then gigabyte has also included a
motherboard inside for us to have a look
at here so let's take the case apart we
can have a look at the internals so the
top is all ventilation which is kind of
cool because that means if you're using
a fan it's actually gonna have somewhere
to pull air from and then on this side
which side ah on this side right here
we've got the vent holes for the 60
millimeter fan that it comes installed
in the case so that's pretty useful as
well here we go why don't we have a look
at the power supply oh you know what
let's take a closer look at the case
first I'm sorry okay so here's the front
of the case it's a it's a glossy plastic
there's your power button there's your
slim optical drive and then you got your
front panel connectors it has kind of a
it's plastic but you know what it
actually looks pretty nice in person it
feels not bad it's not that kind of
plastic II like good this is horrible
sort of feel so then we go around to the
side this is obviously a gatling fan
just I yeah it says yeat lune
electronics right on it and then yeah
it's all steel construction I'm missing
an i/o plate I already knew about that
just because this is a sample board so
it's not 100% retail hardware they might
not even have the i/o plate yet in the
power supply that is a tiny fan so this
is using like a special small
form-factor style power supply and we'll
have a look at the power supply next
there's the bottom nothing interesting
there we'll have a look at the power
supply next to find out just what's
going on with it
so it is a 160 watt power supply which
is okay 10 amps on the 12 volt rail and
then the fun combined are 61
watts so 10 amps I'm gonna do the quick
math times 12 is about it can do about
120 watts on the 12 volt rail alone okay
so something to remember now inside this
motherboard is actually fairly high-end
this is an LGA 1156 Mini ITX motherboard
but even if you're using a high-powered
CPU and you got like a couple sticks of
RAM and all that good stuff even if
you're doing that power supply like this
is still okay because a lot of the power
that gets used up by bigger board
is all the extra stuff that's built on
to them so where you might need a 300
watt power supply for an ATX board you
might get away with a 150 watt power
supply if you're using the same CPU in a
mini ITX board it's just a different
platform and everything is optimized for
low power consumption so let's have a
look at the overall layout of this board
itself you can see obviously it
integrates very very well into this
particular chassis where you can mount
your slim optical here and then your
hard drive goes in this cage which
removes via these screws on the bottom
here so that's where your hard drive
goes that's where your optical drive
goes that was simple very cool
ok so then let's have a look at the
layout of this motherboard I'm just
gonna go ahead and unplug it so that we
can have a better look here this is very
cool though Mini ITX LGA 1156 board
there are a couple on the market but
this is obviously gigabytes offering
it's an 855 board so the part number is
the gah 55 n USB 3 as I said a few times
it's got support for LGA 1156 CPUs so
that means core i3 is core i5s
and I guess you could put a core i7 on
it although it's not really recommended
with most ITX boards due to heat output
considerations I mean look at this case
as well as power considerations because
I mean what are you doing buying an ITX
board if you're trying to use high power
components it doesn't make good sense so
then you've got also this is cool a PCI
Express 16x connector so while this
motherboard with the age 55 chipset does
feature onboard video you could also
take it and put it in something like
that Silverstone case that accepts a
full-length graphics card and you could
install a full-length graphics card in
this as well very cool for a motherboard
that's basically like the size of a hand
okay so you got your 4 pin connector I
guess right where it belongs in the
normal configuration but the a lot of
the other stuff is pretty weird so while
on an ATX board your CPU socket would be
kind of here and then Northbridge here
and a South Bridge started here this
board just has the one chipset up above
the CPU socket here I'm going to orient
this the way it would normally be so the
talk of the i/o shield is here then
you've got your SATA 2 ports up at the
top you've got your front panel port
as well as your USB 2.0 headers up at
the top of the board and then your
24-pin power rather than being along the
right-hand edge is actually up at the
top of the board dual channel ddr3 is
supported by this motherboard and that
pretty much does it for the onboard
features because it's written like I
said it's a very very small very compact
board very cool so let's go around to
the back and have a look at what we have
for onboard connectivity we've got a
built in ps2 combo port so you can use a
mouse or a keyboard there you've got one
two three four USB 2.0 ports and then
you've got VGA DVI and HDMI output as
well as digital audio out that's an
optical digital and then here this is
what is this that's neat hmm I don't
know what that is it looks like a USB
port but it's it's the colour of there
it's the typical color of there eSATA
ports but I'm looking at the the
connection fingers inside you know what
I'm sorry that's nice SATA port well
that was a blonde moment from the eSATA
then we have two USB 3.0 ports one
Gigabit Ethernet and then 7.1 audio so
thank you for checking out my combined
unboxing of the H 55 n USB 3 as well as
the men in black t 31:40</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
