sponsoring our coverage of Computex 2017
you can check them both out at the link
in the video description alright guys so
we're here in the Corsair suite where
they have I would love to say one of the
most over-the-top PC case concepts that
we've ever seen but that would be a
downright damn lie because this is the
most over-the-top case concept we have
ever seen this is the concept slate and
I'm standing close to the camera
intentionally why is it so quiet and
here you guys can keep talking it's fine
and I'm standing so close to the camera
right now so that I can hide a little
bit the utter scale of this freaking
monstrosity look at it this thing is 120
liters of volume of pure enthusiasts
grade PC goodness to put that in
perspective compared to the gigabyte
bricks VR which holds a quad core Core
i7 processor and a gtx 1060 this is I
did the math ahead of time but I
apparently didn't write it down but it's
a lot more times I think it's like 48
times the internal volume so what on
earth would you do with that kind of
space well Corsair clearly has some idea
what you would do so the first thing you
do is put in two motherboards because
right so you can put up to an e ATX or
ssi ee b motherboard in here up on the
top and then get this it comes with PCI
Express risers so you can either put all
of your you know graphics cards and red
rocket accelerators in you know
horizontally like some kind of Stone Age
chump or you can turn four of them
horizontally so that you can see your
SLI graphics cards and all their
water-cooled glory oh yeah of course
there apparently makes custom water
cooling parts now so that's fascinating
then you go ahead and you put another
motherboard in here so the ITX
motherboard which still manages to have
two expansion slots how big the back of
these cases goes right down here at the
bottom and they've even got a bunch of
hardline tubing in here showing how you
could potentially water cool both
systems now in terms of radiator support
I'd love to say this is where it gets
more
nickolas but everything about this case
is on a scale of ridiculous that you
can't really measure it anymore so we've
got slide-out radiator trays for the top
and the front you can either put uh I
think it's up to a quadruple 120 or
quadruple 140 on the top by getting that
right and then you can put up two to
quadruple 120 s here in the front it's
got reservoir mounting completely up the
butt so you can put a reservoir
basically anywhere you want here or
anywhere you want kind of at the back in
there so it can hold up to 34 fans if
you were to install push-pull
configurations on every radiator and to
be clear that does not include the power
supply fan the because of course you
could need up to two power supplies so
there's an ATX one here under the mini
ITX motherboard mount which you can take
off if you want to you know gaze upon
your power supply and all of its glory
and then there's an SFX one that you can
take out a reinforcing bracket and
crammed in at the back speaking of the
back that's where you put all your
drives it takes up to five three and a
half inch drives because that's how
unimportant hard drives are these days
you could have 120 years of space and
you still don't want more than like I
don't know there's five hard drive no
big deal and then they've got room for I
think it's up to eight two and a half
inch SSDs at the back and of course it's
got all the latest features as well so
it's got full RGB integration with
Corsairs new what is it commander Pro
something along those lines yeah I'm
getting the nod as well as an RGB logo
at the front two USB 3.1 type C's for
USB 3.0 regular sized connectors and
curved tempered glass yes my friends
each of these side panels probably
weighs about as much as I do between the
gigantic pane of glass and the aluminum
kind of you know whatever we'll call
this piece so there you have it does
this make any sense I'm not sure but
what I do know is that when I made that
comment Corsair helpfully pointed out to
me that while it may or may not with a
hundred and twenty liters of internal
volume they could cut me up put me in a
blender and literally pour me into it
but that's probably a coincidence
and we're back okay so thanks for
checking out this video here in the
Corsair suite and a huge shout out to
our sponsors for Computex this year
Corsair actually who now I think about
it this is sort of ironic our coverage
is brought to you by the Corsair one a
PC that's sort of not that much less
powerful than this but is literally
one-tenth the size you can check it out
at the link in the video description is
available two gtx 1070 1080 or upcoming
a 1080 TI in a quad core Core i7 and
it's also brought to you by synergy
which works perfectly with this as well
because CG allows you to use a keyboard
now seamlessly between two computers
like oh I don't know say for example if
you went crazy and bought a tower like
this that fits two computers inside it
so check out the link below to save 25%
off synergy don't miss any of our
Computex 2017 charge by making sure
you're subscribed now see you guys again
at the next booth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
