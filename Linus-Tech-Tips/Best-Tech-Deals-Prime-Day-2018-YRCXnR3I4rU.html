if so this is not the video for you
since you're still gonna be spending a
whole lot of money just maybe a bit less
cuz it's prime day and we're here to
tell you what the best tech deals that
we found in spite of Amazon site being a
steaming pile of
did you guys know there's such thing as
prime day every day though how's that
possible
great question with our sponsor honey
honey is the free browser extension that
helps you get the absolute best deals
possible on sites like Amazon because as
a lot of people have pointed out the
deals on the actual prime day are not
necessarily the best deals of the year
on those items so like we said Amazon's
been crashing like crazy since prime day
started so we might have missed a couple
things were sorry Alex did his best but
you know there's only something puppy
fever or what are you even talking about
puppy fever to start out for maybe the
first time in 2018 the Nintendo switch
is on sale so you can get the switch
console 64 gigs of memory and a $20
credit for the Nintendo store for $2.99
u.s. it is possible these are already
sold out but it's hard to say since
searching Nintendo switch just crashes
Amazon if you need a couple more FPS
than you'll get on a console we've got
you covered with enough details to build
an entire PC on the cheapish first of
all for graphics if you're a baller pick
up a GTX 1080 the EVGA FTW version to be
precise for just 500 bucks or if you
don't have quite that much cash lying
around you can step down to the three
gig gtx 1064 just 180 bucks now that
we've got a GPU we need a CPU and board
well good news there's a deal on Amazon
but Newegg is actually the place to go
for that today since you can pick up a
core i7 8700 K and a soos prime Z 374
just for 2498 wow that is a really good
deal that is considerably less than
Amazon with all six of those cores under
the hood you can start your game stream
and start up your game and then grab an
elgato stream deck currently just 130
bucks leveling for that below as well
for storage there's some freaking crazy
deals on right now if you want an end to
SSD you can pick up a 240 gig model from
Kingston for just $70 or if you need a
bit more storage I'll be it at a slower
speed the Sam disc 480 gig SSD the one
we've got link down there is just 80
bucks that's 120 dollars off to finish
off the bill just slap it all in the
ease
DG 73 case that's over half off today so
now you got the bits to go inside your
computer but you still need to see in
here so pick up a pair of Sennheiser HD
450s for half price then when your
eyeballs need some massaging and 144
Hertz is just the medicine they're
looking for at just a hundred and
seventy dollars the viewsonic XG 24:02
will up your game without down in your
bank account too much yes my darling oh
well that's great news because Amazon
also sells food if you want a larger
screen though and you care more about
being cheap then about image quality you
can actually grab a 50-inch 4k TV from
Toshiba
for two hundred and ninety dollars it
comes with a fire TV built in so you
don't have to worry about a garbage
smart TV experience that like what you
get on some budget TVs but lightest I
traveled all the time I can't be
building a desktop and hauling it around
if only there was some way to have a
powerful computer packed inside a small
case fortunately the Acer predator
Helios 300 is making our return to our
prime day showcase from last year and
it's on sale with an i7 16 gigs of ram
and a gtx 1060 for just nine hundred
dollars and it was already one of the
best bang for the buck gaming laptops on
the market and with 200 bucks off while
it only gets better than that
need some relief from x86 well the
essential phone can be your arm oh can
be in your arm Wow awful for just 250
dollars with 128 gigs of storage Android
Oreo 8.1 and the knotch design that you
can argue that Apple copy this guy
features all the current trends in a
phone design that probably won't get any
updates in the future because they gave
up on it finally if you want a tablet to
give your kids grab the fire seven for
forty bucks it might not be the fastest
tablet around in fact I guarantee it's
not but it's 40 bucks and it's pretty
durable so that's good so best of luck
getting things before they sell out or
while the servers are up but if things
don't go your way today then come back
later with honey for more good deals
like everyday whenever you shop on
Amazon
he searches every last one of Amazon's
two million plus sellers to make sure
you're getting the lowest price possible
honey even factors in sales tax shipping
and Amazon Prime status simply put if
there's a better price honey we'll find
it in seconds honey also shows you every
items price history so you can see how
often an items price has changed so you
know if prime day really is the best day
to buy okay if you want to say hi to
YouTube now's the time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
