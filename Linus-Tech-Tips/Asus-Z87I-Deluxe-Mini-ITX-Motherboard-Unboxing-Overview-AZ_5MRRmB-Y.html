ready for anything
click now to learn more welcome to my
unboxing an overview of these z87 I
Deluxe which is a product that I'd be
more excited about if Asus hadn't
unleashed the Maximus 6 impact on us
with this generation of product so
that's an ROG grade MIT export this one
is still very fully featured but in some
slightly different ways so unlike the
last generation product it's got six
SATA ports unlike the last generation
product it's got support for Ultra HD 4k
output however if you are you know
running some kind of a 4k display setup
I would really recommend grabbing a
dedicated graphics card
unlike the ROG board it has onboard
wireless AC which is actually pretty
darn cool and I guess I mean okay that's
already enough differences that the
board justifies its existence somewhat
it has a very very high-end vrm solution
just like the last generation z77 i
Deluxe board so you can see that like
all of their super premium ITX boards it
has a riser like a dotter PCB with a
heatsink all over the front of it a
heatsink all over the back of it and
beyond component rebuilt onto it because
there just wasn't enough room to put all
of that Ober stuff onto one of these
boards it has therefore way optimization
which is a little bit different from how
they implement things on the ROG boards
so that means that it can optimize for
you know running faster it can optimize
for saving power when you're away and it
can even do things like you can set a
maximum power consumption for the CPU
itself thank you for the CPU itself that
it cannot exceed through the AI Suite
software which is again incredibly cool
so let's take you on a bit of a tour of
the board up here in the top right is
the 8 pin CPU power connector next is
the 24 pin power connector it's hard to
really say what the optimal locations
are for things like this on an ITX board
because the chassis really do vary a
fair bit there's six say two three six
gigabit per second ports as I mentioned
before and you'll notice the spacing
this
gives you a quite a bit more flexibility
in terms of where you're plugging them
in because again with that variation in
the layouts of mitx
cases you don't always have a guarantee
as to where you're actually going to be
able to reach the SATA ports full
support for dual channel ddr3 memory so
you can easily plug in up to 16 gigs and
check this out I really like this they
have changed the way that the PCI
Express slot latch is accessed so that's
a full speed pcie 3.0 16x slot and you
can access it from this side or this
side which again is very tailored to the
challenges that people face when
building these little tiny systems that
expert 2 has been added to the board
which means full control whether you're
running three pin or four pin fans using
the AI Suite software and the fan
headers are him here here here and here
so they're all in pretty much the same
spot asus has their patent pending
sensing connector as well for the cpu so
that it can automatically apply the
right control profile it is an LGA 1150
board you've got support for the latest
Haswell processors and as we move around
to the back we find a pretty darn
complete IO so for USB 2.0 ports 6 USB
3.0 ports that's more than the impacts
which has a sort of a bit of a different
loadout if you will
it has a BIOS a clear scene will switch
as well as a BIOS flash back switch so
if you brick the board in the middle of
flashing the BIOS you can restore it
that way dual link DVI DisplayPort and
HDMI optical audio out Intel powered
Gigabit Ethernet as well as wireless AC
and Bluetooth 4.0 and this this is the
thing that is really to me the key
difference between the impact and the
deluxe so it has onboard 5.1 audio
however you're only going to be able to
run 500 Audio 5.1 audio like that can be
reconfigured to 5.1 because normally
you'd have sort of you're lying in your
your line out your mic and your
headphone out and that's kind of or
speakers out and that's kind of it
whereas the impact has a very premium
audio solution built into it this one
has a sort of a ho-hum audio solution
but it brings that Wireless to the table
as well as the extra SATA ports if you
were to build like a
really high-end storage server or
something like that that you want to put
away in a closet you want to trust it
that it's going to be super reliable so
you still want something really high-end
this would work for that so it's just
about the different use case scenarios
oh yeah I probably should have mentioned
there's a USB 3.0 header right here in
kind of the middle of the board not a
very optimal location for that would
have preferred it at the edge and that
leads us to the accessories which I sort
of tore out in my hurry to check out the
board itself six SATA cables and by six
I mean five that's very odd there's only
there's only one in this package I kind
of wonder if that's actually just oh
there's another one that's individually
wrapped as well so six SATA cables as
well as the magnetic antenna for the
onboard wireless connectivity so there
you go you can sort of stick it down
flat you can fold it up like this and
then stick it to something else like
that it'll stick to anything that's got
some you know iron or nickel content in
it
io shield as well as your manual with
the driver disk and this it's actually I
don't know this might sound kind of
crazy but this is one of the cleverest
innovations that I think a Seuss brought
to the table with their latest
generation ITX boards this is instead of
the older style cue connector which is
like a little brick that plugs into the
board and check this out it's a pre-done
smaller brick that is a breakout cable
instead of actually having to plug the
individual things from the case into the
top of the connector itself so you take
this whole thing it's keyed so you can
only install it one way you plug that in
then you can run it wherever it needs to
go and plug all your front panel you
know power switch reset switch and all
your LEDs into that instead which i
think is actually really really cool so
thank you for checking out my unboxing
and overview of the z80 7i deluxe don't
forget to subscribe - tactic to run
boxing through these and other computer
videos like the video if you liked it
dislike it if you just liked it and
leave a comment if you think my teeth
are just too yellow and I should just
stop making YouTube videos because I'm
disgusting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
