2013 guys I have with me today the man
you guys are a fan of this man whether
you know it or not this is George Makris
from Corsair he is the the mastermind
behind the 800 D in pretty much every
case that's followed it so he's the guy
who's responsible for their cases
basically just rocking the house and
this right here is the house that every
other case rocked inside George tell us
about the 900 D super tower PCK welcome
to Linus tech tips at CES 2013 our trip
to the show this year is powered by
Corsair maker of quality PC components
and peripherals our trusted storage
partner is Seagate technology and our
trusted networking partner is Linksys
all right well when we launched 800
about three years ago three and a half
years ago we got a lot of people really
interested it was our first case we made
a lot of changes that everyone kind of
like so like rubber grommets and cable
routing stuff things like that people
really dug but then you know if you're
any kind of a creative person or
perfectionist at all all you see on like
forums is the criticisms like the
thousand guys who love it that's fine
that's great but they're like two guys
who are like ah it's you know it should
have more radiator space or or whatever
so since we launched that I've been like
you can give me a mental checklist of
the things that I wanted to fix based on
like people that said online like oh it
should have more radiator space or
should be a little bit bigger or
whatever and so that's what this is it's
basically that's it's a hey I've
listened to it I fixed it these are all
the really cool things you guys wanted
and then some other stuff we thought of
that maybe you didn't know you wanted so
first off the first complaint a lot of
people said well you know until we got
seven or eight slots when we put ten
slots here so you can put a bigger
motherboard in it fits hptx motherboards
like the SRX or any dual processor board
still get the standard cable routing
stuff with even more space behind it
it's got room for a 480 or a 420 up top
and then down here if you take these
cages out you can put another 480 or 420
on this side or you can put a dual power
supply in here with that power supply
installed you can actually put a 240 or
280 on the outside as well as the 480 or
420 over here okay so hold on a minute
I'm going to stop you here for a minute
because I think we need to clarify this
point I can put a 480 in the top a 240
here and a 480 here and probably one
back here yeah and that is all but you
can do a 240 or 360 also so and that is
all native that's all native you don't
have to drill any holes or anything like
that so it's all taken care of for you
it's a little bit goofy but we kind of I
don't really expect too many people to
load up every spot where the radiator
space someone well but we'll see yeah
there's going to be someone I know who
did because we did it we're doing a
photo of it but there's going to be guys
who wanted maybe to put a 480 but they
don't necessarily want to put it up top
they want to put it on the bottom or
maybe two guys once you know I want to
put three to four tees in one case but I
want to choose where I put them so this
gives them that flexibility so kind of
my mindset is let's give people the
flexibility to do a bunch of different
different things and see how they do it
and like give them that
that chance and I don't like mandating
how you do stuff so that's what this
case is really designed to do well
that's one of the things that made the
800g so special was that there was one
way to do it that was really really good
yeah whereas what we're doing with the
900 Deven is is taking it to the next
level kind of so for example we had a
hot swap a on the 800 II that was fun
accessible a lot of people like that
some people say they didn't care about
it but a lot of people did like the idea
of hot swapping drives so we still have
one of these cages has hot swap
connectors on the back of it so you can
do three hot swap bays and they're real
easy access so you can just pop this
open pull this out and you take your
drive out and put it back in unlike the
800 D the hot swap drive trays are tool
free now so you don't have to screw the
drives in like you did with 800 E so
that's even better the other side is
that hot swapping is relocatable so if
you don't want it down here and you want
to put it up here instead you can remove
it and move it around and the water
cooling guys will love that because now
they have just a ton of options yeah
exactly
and then the other thing we did is on
these cages you have the air flow in the
front from the front three 120s that are
there by default but each cage has fan
mounts on the back so you can do
push-pull on your hard drive cage as
well so you can keep better airflow
across guys so we've done that at some
of our smaller cases like a/c 70 or the
400 or 500 are but this takes it kind of
let's take those features that people
really liked about those cases and put
them up in our flagship so that was one
of the things that was kind of funny as
you sat down and wrote a feature list
out sometimes like the 400 or 500 had
better features than like the 800 e it
had eight full slots which the 800 II
didn't have I have seven and kind of an
eighth slot that was a dongle slot but
this is designed to be kind of okay
let's take all that cool stuff and add
it up to the next level and make it more
ridiculous do you want to show us the
front of the case yeah let's show over
here real quick so you get the nice
aluminum fashion still this is a cast
aluminum surround it's a complete piece
of cast aluminum it's done for
structural rigidity and a little bit of
weight savings over steel if we had done
this had a plastic it would have been a
little bit cheaper but it wouldn't been
anywhere near as rigid and I think if
you see a lot of cases that are plastic
and steel they have a lot of flex to
them because especially full towers and
bigger because you really need that
rigidity of heavy
metal at that time so on the front you
have a floating bezel that just pops
right off like a speaker grille would so
you have these four mounts here and then
just like the the 600 to your 650d you
just have the removable dust filter on
the front so you can really easily
access that so it's a pretty easy setup
by default this case will come with
three 120 s in the front and a 140 in
the back for cooling and it's got really
good air cooling performance as well
which is the other thing people with 800
e said you know it's great for water
cooling but I want to air cool my system
for a while and you know if I put two or
three GPUs in there it's kind of hard to
get good cooling on that this probably
this case doesn't have that problem now
those don't appear to be standard five
and a quarter inch bays up there so
these are these are bigger than five and
a quarter inch bays and we did it
because not many people are using
optical drives anymore so we figured
okay look you know for the width of the
case and look at case we had to get
something that was able to hold those
drives if you wanted them but not
necessarily kind of the same thing so
this pops out and you get a bezel we'll
see if I can get this to work here so
again like I said it's a prototype so so
this pops out and it gives you we've
textured this and made this look pretty
nice and when you put a drive here or a
drive here or drive here they look
pretty good
but yeah you will notice it's not the
same width as the rest of the case so
you know this is one of those things
that I think that people immediately the
modders and stuff are going to find ways
to stealth this piece so they get a
stealth optical drive or a stealth fan
controller and like I said this is tool
free but that's optional you can just
put screws in it and go to town on it
however you like that's just really one
of those things people are going to love
yeah that's that's actually that's
fantastic I mean to clarify I don't
think George believes that few people
use optical drives but few people buying
a case of this caliber need an optical
drive anymore
I don't haven't had an optical drive in
quite a while in my case and to be
honest I don't really miss it
so everything I you know install a game
it's off steam or whatever so I haven't
I haven't actually purchased software on
CD for probably two or three years so
lots of front I oh yeah there's a two
USB three and four USB to Zhan there we
didn't want to add stuff like a lot of
cases have fan controllers or like a
card reader something like that that
adds cost to the case and to be honest
whatever we put in there wouldn't be the
best in the world if you want if you're
going to buy a three to fifty dollar
case my guess is you probably also did a
lot of research on your frame controller
and care very deeply about what Fame
controller you buy and whatever faint
controller I put in there you guys
wouldn't find is good enough and if I
did put the best frame control in the
world and there would cost me an extra
20 or 30 dollars to do a really nice DC
fan control method thing and I don't
know that you would want to pay 380 or
390 or 400 bucks for that case because
it has fan control over it so my guess
is I'll give you guys the freedom to put
whatever card reader or fan control you
guys want and keep the cost out of it so
this case is only fifty dollars more
than 800 es350 instead of 300 and the
reason we were able to get to that so
reasonably with adding all the size and
other features is because we took out
like fan control and some of the other
stuff and the hot swap a is a lot less
expensive of version so the old 800 II
had a kind of a server hot swap baby
just stuck in there this is a much more
user friendly and actually more
compatible version than you guys to see
so cable management wise do you have
just as much room behind the motherboard
tray or is it even more than the 800 D
it's a lot more than under D so this is
about an inch and a quarter in depending
on what area you're in so you actually
have room to fit more like I mean I
don't have the words I don't have the
world's smallest fingers and I can get
my hand back there pretty easily so
let's go let's get a good let's get a
good shot of that there we go
very very nice so it's a it's a lot of
space back there and we took the if
you've ever seen the back of our c70 we
have these plastic latches for cable tie
down we have three of those back here
too but we made them a little bit bigger
a little bit more robust a little bit
stronger for the more cables that the
guys who have a case like this would
have so almost everybody who buys
through $50 case would have SLI or
something like that and this we know
that you're gonna have more cables and
as you can see with the power supply
here the cables go up underneath that
motherboard tray through a cable routing
cutout that's down there so you can just
kind of stealth it and go up straight up
so it's a pretty nice way to restrict
that all right well I think that covers
it pretty much as well as anyone could
