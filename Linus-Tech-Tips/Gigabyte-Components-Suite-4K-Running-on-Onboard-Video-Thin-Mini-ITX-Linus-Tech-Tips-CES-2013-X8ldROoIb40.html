different uses for fundable now we've
been able to do storage for a while and
you know you can talk about storage all
day but now let's talk about something
different so the z77 xup 5 th is the
world's only dual thunderbolt
motherboard has to Thunderbolt spill
fundable ports built right into the back
of it and what I'd like you guys to
notice first about this demo system is
the fact that there is no video card in
it so we are outputting 2 for 1080p
displays as a bit of a 4k simulation if
you will over here on the left from the
onboard graphics so this is native 4k
content that you can see here and we're
using a couple of adapters so we can
take those mini Thunderbolts remember
guys the Thunderbolt connector does
carry a DisplayPort signal and we can
split it out to multiple display ports
in order to achieve this kind of a huge
resolution so the reason for this
solution with the Ergotron stand and 4
DisplayPort monitors is right now it's
pretty hard to get your hands on a 4k
display but it proves the point of what
it is capable of doing in the near
future now Thunderbolt again like I said
not just about storage anymore check
this out so this is the Blackmagic
Design I believe it is the ultra Studio
Express and this guy is a thunderbolt
capture card so you're able to actually
capture footage on your notebook or your
desktop that's equipped with a
thunderbolt port it is PC compatible not
just Mac so it's not limited to just the
Apple users anymore and this is
something that Diesel's very excited
about he's actually had this camera on
pre-order for months now this is black
magics new cinema camera it is a 2.5 k
camera and again it does not use
Thunderbolt but it does use DisplayPort
out so that's one of the other reasons
they've had it on demo here now diesel
clarified a point for me and that is
that it comes with thousand-dollar
software just for scopes and it can
actually output scope and waveform data
so I was a little bit incorrect there
this is a thunderbolt port you can see
it's clearly labeled Thunderbolt and I
got a little confused because I found
out the port is for monitoring only
however it does not just output display
data which is what makes it not just
display port it is capable of daisy
chaining and it is outputting some
additional data as well now with some of
the improvements Intel's made in terms
of thermals and power efficiency over
the last few years we've seen a huge
number of solutions that are allowing us
to shrink performance computing down to
smaller and smaller sizes this is a
regular mini ITX board this is a z77
board with a PCIe 16x slot and it's now
capable of running a very powerful
gaming machine the only thing you can't
do on a board this size it seems these
days is run dual graphics however not
content to leave it at that
Intel has an gigabyte has implemented a
new standard so this is a thin mini-itx
they've got a couple of boards b75 as
well as h77 so the b75 is obviously more
business-oriented we're gonna focus on
that one they're pretty much the same
layout so it's just a chipset change and
what this is is it is a well thinner
version of Mini ITX so it's got the same
mounting holes but you can see the i/o
plate is much much flatter and there's a
very good reason for that it is meant
for all-in-one
do-it-yourself so you can build your own
all-in-one PC now gigabyte has a couple
of unique implementations here so number
one is we're using sodium's so that's
part of the spec you can see there's
built-in power so power comes in from
the back from a from a power brick as
opposed to using a normal power supply
with a fan that we're used to seeing for
a desktop PC they've also got mini PCIe
for your wireless card as well as M SATA
so you'll have the option of either
using an SSD mount in the all-in-one
enclosure or you can throw an M SATA SSD
on there maybe use it for caching and
you throw a hard drive in there's a PCIe
4x slot now I don't expect you to be
able to use that with a card sticking
out of it because I'm gonna show you
guys what it looks like once it's in the
a i/o but there are PCI Express
extension cables so if someone
implemented in a i/o where you could
actually run a graphic
card that would be pretty cool so I'm
gonna turn this around you guys probably
have no idea that this isn't a fully
built computer already this well it is a
fully built computer already was a
custom fully built computer so there are
several manufacturers launching these
DIY capable all-in ones they come with a
thermal solution they come with the
power brick that you need because this
is all standardized for this thin
mini-itx configuration you can see
there's a kingston and SATA card here
there's a pci mini pci express wireless
card got some memory going and one of
the most notable things about this is
the fact that eat no matter what the
machine is doing these heat pipes stay
quite cool we saw a demo before the
video actually started where they were
running some intensive programs and
these are barely warm to the touch
now like i said before you don't have to
stick with them SATA they do also have
as part of the standard the ability to
mount drives in it so you can see you
can throw a three and a half inch drive
there and this particular model right
here and i would expect most of them now
that Windows 8 is passed bays it will
not pass but is the present and the
future is multi-touch ready so you can
actually hear if we go and fire up
mspaint which should be around here
somewhere oh that's no pad that's okay
we can find paint we're good at this
we've done this before and swiping and
paint okay am I gonna need my lovely
assistant to come in here and sort of
use her five fingers so that we can show
that it is accepting ten inputs all at
the same time and of course there's some
evolutions to the desktop boards now
because Intel is or AMD are not
launching any new chipsets or any new
CPUs here at CES we don't have a whole
refresh or anything like that but
gigabyte is introducing the HD series so
these are z77 boards that are aimed at
the value segment and what's different
about these compared to other boards is
the fact that they're coming in at very
aggressive price points and they do
feature DisplayPort hence the HD
designation so you don't have some of
the bells and whistles like you know
sixteen phase power or a four-way SLI
capability or any of that stuff but if
you're looking to build a basic machine
it's still got USB 3 it's
actually four ports of USB 3 that's part
of the z77 spec it's still crossfire
ready it does support dual graphics and
you've got DisplayPort out onboard so it
means you can take advantage of the
features of z77 without sort of going
over the top in terms of the price and
in terms of the expense of manufacturing
so obviously if you're gonna bring a
motherboard to market at a lower price
it has to cost less to manufacture so
that is why they've gone for something
like the slimmer motherboard design so
you can see you can save a little bit on
the PCB right here but it still does
require a standard ATX case to install
we've seen this many times in the past
on value oriented boards don't miss any
of our CES 2013 coverage by making sure
that you're subscribed to Linus tech
tips North American customers might not
be as familiar with them as some other
territories but gigabyte also has a
variety of notebook tablet and
all-in-one solutions on display here at
the show so we have a Windows 8 tablet
with a Celeron processor that actually
has a dock that allows you to add an
optical drive as well as additional
expansion they have a convertible ultra
book so this guy rotates around and
becomes a tablet should you see fit
they've also got this is a fairly unique
solution so this is a magnetic dock as
well as a stand that pops out of the
back of this particular tablet to make
it more like you know more competitive
with something like Microsoft Surface
they've also got a couple more displays
on here so this is just another ultra
book and sort of a more performance
oriented looking gaming machine here and
in a matte black finish this has a gtx
660 m so it's gonna be quite powerful
and actually not as thin as some of the
other notebooks that we've seen with
maybe a GTX 670 or 680 so that's a
compromise that you have to decide if
you're willing to make now behind me
over here we've got their new lineup of
all-in-one so these are fully compliant
with the windows 8 experience and what
you might notice about these ones is the
fact that there is absolutely no
gigabyte branding on them whatsoever so
these are intended for the white box
market which refers to sort of a
distributor or a system integrator or a
retailer who wants to develop their own
all-in-one and do their own branding
behind it so gigabytes basically
providing the motherboard the chassis
itself and the screen itself
and there's no there isn't gonna be a
gigabyte name on it so what you might
want to make a habit of doing is well
okay but don't make a habit of but check
these out sort of look at the industrial
design of them and if you see something
that looks like these particular models
here you'll know who actually built it
which I mean might give you more
confidence in the case of you're going
locating luck well this is a fairly
inexpensive AI oh do I trust this thing
or not who made this at least you'll
know that it was actually manufactured
by gigabyte with their expertise so
don't miss any of our CES 2013 coverage
by making sure that you're subscribed to
Linus tech tips quite honestly we missed
this one our first time around because
it looked like a normal 24 inch
all-in-one it sort of from the front
there's like you know webcam and a bezel
and sort of nothing that seems out of
the ordinary but then when you get
around to the back you find a two and a
half inch expansion drive slot so that
means you can quickly and easily expand
the storage of the device and diesel and
I are gonna switch places over here I'd
like him to come check out this side of
the unit where the real magic happens so
it's actually not that thick but check
that out at the bottom you can install a
full sized graphics card in this
all-in-one PC via the example that
they've had running so internally
they've had running as high as a GTX 680
off of this machine so you actually have
the capability now of taking the
all-in-one form factor I'll be it a
little bit thicker and having what would
essentially be a full size gaming
desktop performance out of it
