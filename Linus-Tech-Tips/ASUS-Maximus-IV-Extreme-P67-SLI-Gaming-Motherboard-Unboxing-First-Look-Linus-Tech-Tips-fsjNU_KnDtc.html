motherboard it is evidently designed for
overclocking it is part of the Republic
of gamers brand for masseuse it supports
the latest Intel Core i7 core i5 and
core i3 processors if for whatever
reason you're putting the core i3 on
extreme motherboard which you shouldn't
be doing on the LGA 1155 platform it
features the Intel P 67 chipset it is
fully sli ready and ATI crossfire X
radio that should probably be called AMD
crossfire X at some point it features
the I direct which is vaunted gosh-darn
minute
Bluetooth no well you know what we'll
get into that later
ROG connect which I am familiar with so
you use a USB cable to plug into a third
party computer using a utility to
overclock your PC 3dmark Vantage is
included 10 USB 3.0 ports 2 at the front
8 at the back we've also got a Bluetooth
module accessory card which is included
hadji connect which we talked about
already supports 3-way SLI and
CrossFireX so not four-way but three
ways just plenty for an LGA 1155 socket
anyhow I mean remember the CPU only has
16 PCIe lanes built into the the
controller anyway oh you know what I
have showed you the whole package
there we go so more of the same
information here ok I direct here we go
tune your PC from your iPhone or iPad
now nice just in case you want to
extreme engine DIGI+ so that is powerful
combination of analog and digital design
elements for the VRM there's the
motherboard itself let's get this baby
opened up so accessories box first
because I always skis you guys like that
there we go lots of accessories this is
a high-end board so it has all the
accessories so this is that bluetooth
module okay this is our 3-way SLI bridge
here's our 2-way rather crossfire bridge
here's our two-way SLI bridge we're
gonna put those all together this didn't
team organized right to me all right
we've got some zip ties we've got the Q
connectors we've also got voltage
checkpoints so probe it quick
installation things so you can check the
voltages and we'll cover that when we
have a look at the board itself IO
shield couple temp probes three to be
exact
Maximus for extreme user guide including
sticker and installation DVD as well as
labels for your SATA cables so you can
keep track of which are which once
you've already routed them in your case
finally exclusive feature guide so rog
connect RC bluetooth and ROG I direct
overclocking from your iphone next I'm
expecting them to include utility that
lets you overclock your iPhone but that
weird case sticker the big huge one that
I did eventually find someone who had
installed it on their case that was that
was interesting next we've got the ROG
connect cable which is a USB cable with
ROG stamped on it essentially oK we've
got four SATA 3 six gigabit per second
cables which are only different from the
other ones and the fact that they're
white they're all right angle and then
we have four more right angle SATA 2
connectors we have rear USB 2.0 bracket
and that is it for the accessories now
let's close that back up and have a look
at the board itself so as soos has had
the whole Republic of gamers color
scheme thing just figure it out for a
while now I mean look at this this looks
fantastic oh you're the light camera man
way to go alright so from that angle
this should look pretty darn impressive
which is what it looks like in person so
why don't we start at the middle of the
board here's our LGA 1155 socket
surrounded by the digi+ vrm so you can
see
here that they're using a fairly
different looking design for the for the
voltage regulation modules remember that
clean voltage to your CPU is very
important for achieving the highest
possible overclocks we've also got I
mean they've done such a good job of
these on the last few generations of
boards really neat-looking MOSFET heat
sinks as well as heat pipes that tie
them into the Northbridge heatsink and
then nothing connected but you can see
that the Southbridge heatsink is
stylized similarly as well now I do know
they're not called Northbridge and
Southbridge anymore but I'm old-school
like that you're not gonna break that
habit sorry guys
alright we've gone our 8 pin power
connector up here at the top of the
board right where it belongs
top left ideal location now we don't
have dual eight pins but I would go as
far as to say that's completely
unnecessary on a p67 board alright we've
got let's move this way so we have four
ddr3 slots supporting dual channel these
are the easy install slots so they only
have clips on the one side you put your
module in like this then you clip it
closed all right we've got built-in
start and reset switches we have liquid
nitrogen mode switch on and off so that
might be handy if you're benchmarking
with liquid nitrogen this this is smart
this is a much better place for the post
LED because you can actually see this
when you have graphics cards installed
love it start reset also we have the
PCIe 16x switches these I'm a big fan of
as well.if specially if you have water
cooling installed full cover blocks it
can be a real pain to troubleshoot which
card is on the fritz so you can turn off
your PCIe lanes and boot to whichever
card you want here are all the VR
voltage check points so we have RAM CPU
NF 200 chip even PCH PLL PCH CPU i/o CPU
PLL CP oh sorry this is a CPU si alright
moving down we have the Go button
we have a 24 pin power connector in its
ideal location along the right hand edge
of the board we have SATA i/o so did you
do this red ones red ones are say two
three six gigabit per second these ones
are running off the Intel chipset these
ones are running off a third-party
chipset these are SATA 2 3 gigabit per
second and since this is a B 3-year
vision board they are not affected by
the bug that
- the original p67 boards here's a bio
switch so we have two dedicated Hardware
BIOS chips you can save one set of
settings and the other one and then if
you're experimenting you can switch over
to your other BIOS boot up to that one
and then play around with whatever it is
you want to do here's all your front
panel connectors moving right along
we've got clear seamos somewhere there's
a little arrow pointing somewhere not
sure what in the heck okay you know what
just don't 1 2 2 disable enable 1 2 2 3
disable to clear seamless I don't know
what this does I forget it ok we've got
4 USB 2.0 front panel headers because
they didn't really have any room for
them on the back since it's full of USB
3 couple fan headers we've got a couple
of easy plug so one two easy plugs so if
you are installing a ton of graphics
cards I would definitely recommend using
those because they will help provide
some supplementary power to your cards
we have one two three four four PCIe 16x
slots they are all wired for note hold
on one two three of them are wired for
16x so those ones are going to be
running off the nf 200 chip this one is
only wired for 8x so if you install
three card you're going to be using up
this this and this you will have no room
for additional expansion cards now this
one right here is PCIe 1x that one's
gonna have full bandwidth regardless
this is a PCIe 4x that's running off the
chipset so that one will have full
bandwidth regardless of what you install
in all these slots so these are gonna
run in I could check the manual but I'm
just gonna guess correct me if I'm wrong
should be 16 16 16 or it could also be 8
8 8 8 but you can't run four-way SLI or
crossfire anyway so I don't really see
the point doing that unless you're
folding folding at home ok USB 3.0 rear
panel header so that's an interesting
location for that I guess if you're
gonna put like a PCI bracket in that
would be useful and then finally I think
that's pretty much it so here's where
the Bluetooth module installs the one
that was in the packaging and one more
thing back out from the board so this is
not a standard ATX board like many
Republic of gamers boards in the past it
is slightly wider so an ATX board would
end right here this board end
right here so while you don't need an e
ATX case you do need an ATX case that is
a little bit wider than the farther far
right most mounting holes to make sure
that you'll be able to install this
board now another thing I want to talk
about is we have one two three four here
back out because you're not gonna be
able to see where I'm pointing one two
three four five six seven eight
PWM fan headers on this motherboard so
you can plug in a ton of fans to this
motherboard without overloading it
alright let's have a look at the back io
plate last but not least we've got a ps2
you have a ps2 keyboard mouse combo port
one two three four five six seven eight
USB 3.0 ports two eSATA ports a clear
CMOS switch optical audio out two Intel
gigabit network connections so these are
not using third-party controllers we
have the ROG connect button as well as
the ROG connect port as well as 7.1
audio out on the back of the board we
find a couple of heat sinks for the
MOSFETs so those are going to give you
an additional little bit of heat
dissipation on the back of the board and
also of note is the fact that all of the
heat sinks on this motherboard are using
screws spring loaded screws with plastic
washers to ensure no shorting out and
also no disengaging like you can have
happen from time to time with those
plastic clips thank you for checking out
