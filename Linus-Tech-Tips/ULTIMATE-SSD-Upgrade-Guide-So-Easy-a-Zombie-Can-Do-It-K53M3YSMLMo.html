and reliability of an SSD but not
everyone is comfortable opening up their
PC to perform upgrades so we challenged
ourselves to create an SSD upgrade guide
that is so easy to follow along with
that even a zombie could do it but how
do you test such a concept well we could
only think of one way we had some great
luck though and we were able to dig up
the perfect assistant I'd love for you
guys to welcome my great-great-great
great-great great-great uncle Jim to our
SSD upgrade guide however he's a little
bit on the old side so you'll have to be
patient he's still working on the first
steps of the guide come on that was
funny man hold on can someone give us a
hand here Jim's falling now that we've
got Jim somewhat stabilized over here
it's time to begin so like all PC
upgrades or repairs
it starts with gathering all the tools
you need at a safe clean workstation so
first up a multi-bit screwdriver second
up is a grounding strap no no it's okay
not that kind of ground we're not gonna
put you back in there Jim so here I'm
just gonna put this on your wrist that
keeps your hardware safe from static
electricity now if you'll just what if
my Philips head I'll be right back
look at that I found it all right so now
that we have the appropriate screwdriver
bit we can go ahead and remove the
screws from the side pound here you go
you'll need that and the tank at the
side panels off
what's her inside the case we can find
the existing hard drive which is handy
because it'll show you where the drives
mount in your case and give you a point
of reference for where the new drive is
going to go you can also follow the
connectors back to find out where they
come from use four small screws they're
going to be included with your case
you're going to need this to to mount
the SSD onto a drive sled or however the
mounting system works in your PC plug
your SATA data and power connectors in
then you can close up the side panels
and boot the PC just like normal go
ahead and press that power button Jim
thank you very much once you're at the
Windows desktop you can go ahead and run
the Acronis cloning software that's
included with your a data SP 920 SSD and
basically it's a waiting game
I would recommend here can you grab that
again I would recommend before you start
clearing any extra files off of your
hard drive so that while you're waiting
for them to transfer you don't get bored
- I'm death oh come on that wasn't that
bad give it a rest game pace you know
Jim you are doing absolutely fantastic
you waited for the drive to clone and
you didn't eat any brains at all great
job all right so now that the cloning
process is done you're gonna want to
enter the UEFI BIOS and reconfigure your
SSD as your first boot device because
otherwise you could boot up your
computer you could boot up your computer
and you wouldn't even be able to tell
the difference between those two drives
because the data on them the OS and
everything the programs are exactly the
same I mean you'd be able to tell the
difference because one is of course much
much faster now once you've done that
and booted up into Windows you can
decide what to do with that old hard
drive you could give it to a friend in
need
example you know I have too many friends
do you or you could use it as a storage
drive so you can put your favorite music
on it like Monster Mash your favorite
shows like Walking Dead hmm and your
favorite movie is like Shaun of the Dead
they're zombies even kind of winning
that one don't they yeah yeah okay I
think I think we're pretty much done
it's booted up
you got your SSD in there you robbed it
man so there you have it folks ah a
successful experiment I guess we learned
a few things number one a zombie can
indeed install an SSD with the right
guidance number two aforementioned
zombie can become enraged and turned
violent and number three is contouring
what we thought before starting this
process here you are not allowed to dig
up the corpses even of your very close
relatives so we will bear that in mind
for next time in the meantime guys like
this video if you just liked it or liked
it if you liked it dislike it if you
disliked it give it a share if you think
other people need to know how simple it
is to install an SSD but in the meantime
guys we got to go so peace out don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
on boy
our thanks to a data for providing their
sp9 20 SSD for this guide it's fast
affordable and apparently tastes like
brains</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
