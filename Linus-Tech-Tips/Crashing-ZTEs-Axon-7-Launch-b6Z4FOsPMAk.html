teehee can never keep track of what the
Canadian way is check out this hotel
room not much privacy in the bathroom
but fortunately Brandon and I are not
sharing a room it's huge
and it gets better check this out views
incredible
but why would ZTE sponsor us all the way
to China to make a video I mean how many
kilometers is that I guess we'll never
know
and what exactly is it that goes on at
an event like this well I'm going to
take this opportunity to show you guys
firsthand what it's like to attend a
press launch event as Linus from Linus
tech tips so we're on our way in to get
briefed on the phone let's see how long
it takes Brendan to hate on my selfie
stick it starts with the totally above
board early access to the event venue
you can tell in this shot that they
weren't quite ready for me because the
red carpet still has the protective
plastic covering on it which Brendan of
course trampled on next it's time for
the VIP room this is where most of the
learning actually takes place and it was
where I saw the axon 7 for the first
time these briefings are great because
they give me a chance not only to run
through the specs of the device but to
probe about the rationale behind the
various design choices so the philosophy
then behind the axon 7 is influenced
heavily by trying to answer the question
what makes a phone quote unquote
flagship well first and foremost is spec
so the axon 7 sports a quad-core
Snapdragon 820 with Padrino 530 graphics
4 gigs of lpddr4 ram a 3140 milliamp
hour non removable battery with quick
charge 3.0 support over its USB type-c
connector and a five and a half inch
AMOLED 1440p display with Corning
Gorilla Glass 4 but the other big thing
at work here was apparently figuring out
common use cases and then addressing
them one by one so a lot of work was put
into audio with a dual standalone chip
amp and DAC solution from AKM with Dolby
Atmos software running on the back end
and dual front-facing speakers something
that I wish was much more common this
was done for a variety of reasons to
improve call quality on conference calls
for business minded folks and to help
music lovers avoid carrying around a
Bluetooth speaker
with solid headphone sound quality as
another great bonus another use case
specific feature is that the axon 7 has
hardware support for pretty much every
Wireless band known to men along with a
second slot next to the primary slim
slot that can be used either as microSD
expansion for the 64 gigs of storage
that comes standard which shouldn't be
overlooked by the way as something that
to me defines flagship as I've said
before it is laughable to me that some
other companies are trying to sell 600
plus dollar phones with 16 gigs of
storage or it can be used for a second
SIM slot for frequent travellers or
people who find a better deal on data
from one carrier and voice from another
next it's pretty common for me to cause
some kind of a disturbance at the event
until I get a device of my own to tool
around with all right so we just got out
of our briefing and people are trying to
have a conversation and I went and turn
this thing on and now they're like what
are we going to do with this guy just
talking on his little camera over there
so I've got the phone in my bag already
managed to secure that at this point but
we're trying to find me a VR headset
they don't have them out yet but I'm
never afraid to ask for special treat
yourself at which time we'll sometimes
wander around and try to get early
access to people or areas of the event
that again normally wouldn't be
available until later hopefully the
burly security guard lets me through yep
it's all about just walking around like
you own the place so at my second
briefing I got a lot more information
about the camera it's a 20 megapixel
still 4k video affair with an F 1.8 lens
and both electronic and optical image
stabilization to help with low-light
performance and stability while shooting
video with a redesigned simpler app with
automatical mode selection and voice
controlled capture as well as the
fingerprint scanner that's positioned
between two grooves on the back for easy
access without looking and the Det te is
claiming and it looks like there may
well be some validity to this is one of
the fastest available on the market and
then finally perhaps most importantly if
you're into that sort of thing
their upcoming VR headset that combined
with the axon 7 will be one of the first
Google daydream compliant solutions with
significantly lower latency and
hopefully pretty solid image quality
thanks to the 1440p screen from there
out of politeness I sometimes attend the
keynote usually if there's still an
important piece of information that I'm
waiting for
sometimes these keynotes are weirder and
more awkward than other times but in
this case it turned out to be totally
worth it since I managed to ask someone
what the characters next to the numbers
meant on one of the slides and I found
out the axon 7 will be launching at 449
in the u.s. not too freaking shabby
considering everything we've seen then
finally when all of that's done I lie in
my room with my boxers on writing up a
video much like this one but I won't
subject you to that part of the
experience so thanks for watching guys
if this video sucked you know what to do
but if it was good get subscribed hit
that like button and maybe even consider
supporting us you can buy a cool t-shirt
like not this one
normally I wear our shirts but I was
traveling today and these are really
comfortable anyway and you can also join
our forum where you can ask questions
answer questions and generally just chat
with the Linus tech tips community now
that you're done doing all that stuff
you're probably wondering gee what
should I watch next well maybe check out
that video suggestion we've got for you
right up there in the right hand corner
I'll see you guys when I'm back in
Canada I'm very far away right now
then sick</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
