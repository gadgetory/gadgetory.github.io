glory and I know I've covered this thing
to death from different events and even
my oculus overview video from back in
the day if you want to learn things
about like low persistence and stuff
check that video out if you want to see
what lioness media group as a whole
thinks and a special guest what he
thinks as well carry on in this video
we'll see all of their footage and then
I'll talk to you guys more about the
finer details of it later on the flash
voyager GTX USB 3 drive from Corsair
provides SSD like performance and fits
comfortably in your pocket click now to
learn more oh this makes me happy
why does it look like the inside of a
vagina that's pretty cool I was behind
the headrests prevent this me up I feel
like I can touch stuff except that I
can't accept that
there is something here but that's the
desk it is it is actually visually
distressing looking down a cliff though
like you there's a real sense of of
depth down there a man just this
thumbstick version of head movement yeah
it's really I really feel like it you
don't think that it should be just head
and then left thumbstick yeah it's
definitely weird to have a controller
but then be able to just turn your head
and see all this stuff look at all this
stuff around me I'm in a world leaning
too far bow oh ok ok I don't think
there's anything here I'll take the
controller ok here we go alright it's
jittering oh wow Oh terrible terrible
let me know if you want to yeah who in
their right mind wants to do that yeah
this is great I love it hmm no seriously
does anyone enjoy that last one you just
gave me I do I'm gonna come on you do
not you actually enjoying I like that
one yeah Brandon Brandon wanted to
sustain it the most so he's be craziest
as well man do do it being a pentile
matrix display instead of a square grid
display the screen door effect isn't
nearly as noticeable you can still see
the pixels obviously but not nearly as
much as on the dk1
and obviously the resolution jumped
helped as well but we're still gonna
need higher resolutions 4k I'm looking
at you the low persistence is great but
it's refresh rate could be a little bit
higher we're currently at 75 could do
with maybe about 90 and one thing that
we noticed is the frame rate in gains
needs to be high and it needs to be
consistently high low frame rate dips
even will really really jar you out of
the game and it's very unsettling
actually games also need to be made for
the rift in mind especially the rift in
mind they need to be high quality most
of what we have right now is more tech
demos than anything but something to
remember is that we're using a
development kit so that kind of makes
sense another thing that could help is
more range on the motion tracking camera
or possibly an array of cameras it's
quite easy to get out of the tracking
zone even in a seated experience which
is what it's supposed to be targeted for
also we need more made for VR
controllers something like though on the
lines of the control VR would really
help because having your hands stuck in
position while your hands are actually
moving in real life really disconnects
and breaks the immersion not being said
the USB 2.0 hub on the top of the dk2
does kind of help with that because if
you want to get o mount say a leap
motion onto the top of your unit it is
possible and that's pretty cool that
they're trying to cater to that type of
user
due to the new more compact form factor
it actually feels considerably lighter
buta less leverage but it still could
feel lighter it's still a little bit
heavy on the front of your face
considering it is hanging off of the
front of your face also the new cabling
system is quite fantastic and much more
easy to deal with in the dk1 but it
would be really nice if you didn't need
the cables although I'm not really
looking for that anytime soon I don't
expect that to be on cv1 I don't even
I've had to be on like cv3 so I'm not
too worried about that
speaking of cabling the cable box that
goes in between your oculus unit and
your computer has gotten much more
elegant it used to be this fairly large
a little bit clunky box that you had to
kind of have a dedicated spot for and
now it's an inline module that can just
hang anywhere and it's not really that
big of a deal huge improvement again
speaking of cables they're quite long
but maybe not long enough for everyone
but that's actually fine because even
with the director rift functionality
you'll be able to use extensions as it
won't be seen as a different device with
an extension so you can just extend USB
2.0 and HDMI which is quite common and
you'll be fine speaking of director rift
holy crap this thing's awesome you don't
have to extend your screen anymore and
you don't have to have any weird manual
adapter targeting settings on shortcuts
for any of your executables it just kind
of works you run an executable that says
direct to rift and it goes to the rift
which will be sitting on your desk in a
sleep mode before it's activated and
then once you run that executable it
will wake up it will go to the rifts
screen and everything will work that is
as long as you're not running it through
like an HDMI splitter which shows up as
a different device or something like a
aver media capture card we're closing
show up as an Avery media capture card
the computer needs to be able to see
that the HDMI plugged in is an oculus so
I don't know if I would necessarily
recommend a dk2 to anyone right now but
I obviously thought it wasn't a terrible
idea as I personally purchased it for
myself so what do you guys think let me
know in the forum let me know in the
comments down below would you be
interested in buying one right now and
speaking of saving money by not buying a
dk2 who wouldn't want to save money on
their new phone plan today's video
sponsor ting claims that 98% of people
would save money by switching to their
mobile service their whole thing is they
want customers to have the benefits of a
small mobile carrier like personalized
customer service where you actually get
to speak with a human being rather than
hearing our menu options have changed
every three seconds and simple flexible
billing options that are designed to
save you money but without the typical
small carrier issue of not getting good
enough reception because they're on some
janky small network they're 100% upfront
about the fact that they're actually
on the Sprint network so hit the link in
the video description now to try out
their savings calculator where you can
enter the details from your last three
bills and see if you'll save money
switching to Tings pay only for what you
use system which is kind of awesome
alright guys so the ting is I'm gonna
need you to comment down below in the
description and on the forum about what
I asked before earlier if you guys think
the dk2 is right to purchase now also
