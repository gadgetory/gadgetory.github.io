than fallen from grace from attacks on
their new launch video for the oculus
touch controllers like the nightmare
fuel like versus dislike bar the to the
comments section with people saying
things like oculus is anti-consumer an
anti-competitive that they're killing an
exciting new area of Technology with
terrible business practices that they're
turning into the apple of VR that they
are the cancer of VR people are really
mad and my Twitter polls showing a shift
of our community's outlook to the vive
compared to the rift it obviously
doesn't capture the entire picture it's
not just that people seem to generally
prefer the vive these days it's more
that they're enraged at oculus let's
explore why and while we're at it I'll
give a two and a half months late review
of the rift
Kulu masters master case maker five
features to the freeform modular system
allowing you to customize adjust and
upgrade make it yours at the link below
putting aside the hatred for a moment
ignoring room scale forgetting about the
controllers and putting a pause on the
accusations of bad business practices
trust me we'll get back to those soon
but taking just a moment to look at the
headset alone the rift is actually
rather remarkable the combination of the
tension retracting mechanism and the
velcro straps make it effortless to fit
the rift onto your head
the lightweight overall design and high
quality materials make it quite
comfortable to wear the IPD adjustment
or like how far away the lenses are from
each other is easy to find and simple to
use
even the on ear headphones are
surprisingly quite good meaning that you
won't have to worry about earbuds or
headphones falling off or falling out
when you whip your head around in VR
everything about the headset even down
to the cable breakout feels quality but
unfortunately for oculus immersion in VR
is key and an important big step to
immersion is getting your hands in the
experience without some form of hand
presence even something rudimentary the
rift feels incomplete especially because
we aren't examining it in a magic vacuum
where other products like the HTC vive
don't exist content especially exclusive
content could be the answer to this but
honestly I found the games pretty boring
I see no benefit to Lucky's tale a
platformer being in VR and as cool as a
demo that it was to track the progress
of the rifts development the multiplayer
space dogfighter e Valkyrie got a little
dull after a while even the climb a
beautiful rock climbing simulator from
Crytek was much less engaging than it
should have felt thanks to the Xbox
controller
I mean sure for passive experiences that
don't require controller input like
watching movies in a virtual reality
theater or the throbbing market of POV
virtual reality experiences for adults
the oculus actually wins pretty
handily the headset is lighter and more
comfortable for long-term viewing and
the foam face padding collects less you
know perspiration to keep it at least
the headset itself more hygienic ah
which isn't to say that oculus has no
solution for hand presence in VR the
oculus touch controller is fantastic
I've used it and in my opinion it's even
just slightly better than the admittedly
wonderful vive controllers so great it
wins but you can't win an award if you
don't show up for it so where the hell
is it well let's see there's a new video
on the oculus YouTube channel about the
touch surely that will tell us when it's
coming out how much it will cost etc
nope just a video of some attractive
people being super excited about
watching each other play VR games which
is pretty awkward and kind of boring for
the most part by the way oh and it's
coming this year so that's good news I
guess
so the headset is good the touch
controllers are late but they're coming
let's get back to the community anger I
alluded to earlier while the hate it's
partly to do with the first part of the
video title the over 30 full games part
at first this sounds awesome the lack of
full games has been a big problem for VR
so far so to have a whopping 30 of them
coming out is a great thing the problem
with that is that a significant number
of them are going to be exclusive or
wait are they there's actually some
misinformation floating around here
oculus doesn't actually seem to be after
full-on exclusives what they are doing
is giving developers straight-up cash
for them to release on their platform
first in one case the most documented
case in fact they didn't even suggest a
timed exclusivity clause the developer
said it would take them two to three
months to release on the vive and they
were cool with that Gabe Newell by
contrast responded to a fans email
stating that while they do financially
support devs by essentially giving them
an advance on their steam sales they
never asked for any form of exclusivity
timed or not so you can decide to raise
your pitchfork or not you're entitled to
that but personally until I have more
hard facts mine has been stowed but the
ultimate question remains should you buy
one nope the vibe I was hesitant to
recommend the glorified tech demo game
library and high price point are both
difficult pills to swallow but as an
enthusiast who's been saving for quite
some time I bit the bullet as far as the
riff goes at this point I would not
suggest the purchase of a rift
regardless of if you want a seated or
standing experience and I'm even trying
to cancel the order from my personal
rift which if unsuccessful will probably
turn into just selling it on eBay
shocker right well it's true there's a
lot to like about the rift but ever
since trying the newer version of the
vive at CES this year I've been simply
uninterested in the Xbox controller
centric experience that the rift
currently is for the consumer and I'll
need to find out how much the
controller's cost and when I can even
get them before I'm willing to give it
another chance at this point this is an
incomplete experience and the vive is a
complete experience it seems like a
generational gap and I'm going with the
vive personally tunnel bear is a simple
VPN app that makes it easy to browse
privately and enjoy a more open Internet
the information is kept private from
your internet provider advertisers and
even some hackers or anyone just looking
to track or profit from your data column
bear has a top rated privacy policy and
does not log your activity try for free
with 500 megabytes and no credit card
required and if you choose to get
unlimited data you can save 10% by going
to tunnel bear comm /l tt thanks for
watching guys
if it sucked you know what to do if it
was awesome get subscribed hit the like
button or even consider joining the
forum because it's cool over there and
you can become a contributor if you want
but you really don't get much to be
completely honest so you can just bro
out and be a member
that's fun to check out this video which
is a random one of the videos where I
said that I was going to keep my
pre-order for the rift you know whatever
I was probably talking about the dk2 at
that point in time but don't worry about
it I'm gonna go play five games</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
