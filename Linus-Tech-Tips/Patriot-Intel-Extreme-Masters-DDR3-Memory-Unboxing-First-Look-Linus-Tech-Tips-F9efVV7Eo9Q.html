Extreme Masters limited edition memories
so this is the official memory sponsor
of the Intel Extreme Masters which is
sometimes gaming event right
okay thanks like okay so some kind of
gaming event so Patriot basically is
ensuring the compatibility through 100%
hand testing these modules with Intel
based motherboards so that doesn't mean
necessarily just didn't tell branded
motherboards but motherboards based on
Intel chipsets supports Intel Core i7 is
an Intel Core and basically anything XMP
certified which means you don't have to
fuss around the settings it'll figure it
out on its own it uses Patriot design
heat spreaders for advanced cooling and
they look pretty slick not like you
slick like like sleek he's not sleek at
all he's actually very tall which is a
good thing you know for our tall viewers
I like tell people the UM shelter me
from the wind and rain if they're fat
and really tall and they have Lincoln
bellies it's like you can stand under it
although you even want to stand on your
belly that's awkward let's look at the
memory shall we so with a black PCB and
blue memory you've got kind of an Intel
ask sort of color scheme going on here
this particular kit is a 16 gig kit
running at 1.5 volts 1600 megahertz 999
really small 24 latencies and pretty
much what you've come to expect from
memory except it'll look really sweet on
your motherboard so let's go find a
motherboard to link install it on while
we're at it why don't we do a quick
memory installation guide line up the
thing with the thing to push the thing
even leave with the things and make sure
the clips are in place so I want you
guys to check that out how that looks
installed on your black and blue themed
motherboard diesels taking some artsy
shots cuz he's like one of those hipster
like camera kids so thank you for
checking out this unboxing and first
look
