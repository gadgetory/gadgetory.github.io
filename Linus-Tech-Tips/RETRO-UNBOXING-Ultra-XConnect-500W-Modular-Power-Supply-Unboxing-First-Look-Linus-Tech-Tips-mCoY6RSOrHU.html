candidate in our warehouse I guess
nobody wanted it but this is the
original ultra X Kinect power supply
with customizable cabling technology so
what is now known as a modular power
supply this is I guess for one way or
another it is the original one so it
includes 9x connect cables and dual
eighty millimeter fan cooling this is an
old old product so why don't we come
around so this was back when a 500 watt
power supply was like a premium premium
power supply these days like most OEM
power supplies are kind of getting up
there 400 500 Watts so supports Intel
Pentium 4 and AMD CPUs meets ATX version
2.0 3 and 2 1.2 specifications a
short-circuit protection inrush current
protection thermal overload cutoff
protection and what else do we have here
FCC and ul approved o UV ready cables
that's pretty cool you know what that's
a feature we still haven't seen since
then so what do we have on the side so
this tells us all the cables that are
included but that's ok we'll have a look
at that when we get inside the box you
can see it has a single 12 volt rail
which was typical back in those days now
we see power supplies with as many as 6
12-volt rails and that single 12 volt
rail is capable of providing only 408
watts
so these days because most systems are
so 12-volt dependent you see that most
power supplies are actually rated for at
or near their entire wattage rating on
the 12 volt rail so you typically see
somewhere between 490 to 500 Watts
available on the 12 volt rail now get
this this is a this is a marketing call
out 70% typical efficiency Wow
these days like I said it's gonna be a
lot better I didn't say that yet but I'm
going to say it's a lot better than that
80 plus gold power supplies are now
available on the market which is
basically 90 plus it's like 88 or 89
percent minimum efficiency so yeah it
some things have changed a lot ah
since this power supply hit the market
this is a brand new unit getting the
dust off it here opening this baby up
alright so the first thing we find
inside is the business so it's a box and
it's full of the X connect cable
technology cables so we will see what we
have here all right so we've got a
little user's manual which oh we better
register for our warranty register to
win you think if I send this in I'll
actually still be able to win what do
you win doesn't even say what you win no
that's stupid on online with two eyes
nice okay um honey we got use only the
cables you need no unwanted cables so
basically everything that we already
know about modular cables so it shows
you how to plug in cables okay that's
fine that's cool next we have a power
connector so that's your standard
connector that we still use to this day
all right
next we've got five screws just in case
you lose one or it strips or whatever
else so this is a fully modular power
supply which means everything including
the 20 pin power connector because it
does not have a 24-pin connector is
fully modular it's fairly flexible it's
got like a UV blue translucent
rubberized finish on it so if you're
plugging in an ancient motherboard you
could use this cable alright next we
have oh wow do you have it yeah yeah
there we go so it's p4 ready which means
that you've got a Pentium 4 4 pin
connector okay so that means yeah what
else do we have does it have like SATA
oh it does ok so let me see exactly how
this works so it has only to say oh oh
it has this ancient auxilary connector
as well so that I haven't seen in quite
a few years so it's actually got only
molex connectors on it but you can adapt
one of those molex connectors to 2 SATA
connectors if you're running like a
premium SATA hard drive yeah
alright so why don't we get the power
supply at cell phone you know I didn't
realize just how old this product was
until I looked at the outside of the box
and I saw that the NCIX
you number is one two something
something we're up to five zero
something something something so this is
actually like I mean how do you even
quantify that it's yeah its weights one
of the first I guess 12,000 skis ever
created on NCI XCOM okay so here we go
so you've got little rubberized
connectors they cover up the modular
interface you know keep dust out of
there when you're not using your 24 pin
connector or whatever else it is that
you're would or wouldn't be using
there's your four pin so that's pretty
nice it's actually got a beautiful
glossy black glossy blue finish on it so
I'll do my obligatory finger shot here
where you can see the shininess that's
going on you can see that the QC was
past the high pot was passed and we've
got another little speck sticker here
that shows us the same things that we
saw on the side of the box up on the top
of the unit we've got again a nice
glossy blue finish that is actually
reasonably scratch resistant compared to
what we see these days so it looks like
paint technology hasn't hasn't really
improved for the most part okay then
here we've got yet another glossy blue
finish here we've got an 80 millimeter
fan you don't see too many premium power
supplies with AD male fans and all of
them have can accept both 115 and 230
volt inputs these days almost so that's
an adjustable feature there you got a
big power switch and then your power in
and then you've got an ultra fan grill
over a what appears to be a 92
millimeter fan or it might be another 80
millimeter fan can't tell off the top of
my head but there you have it that was
my unboxing of the Ultra X Connect
modular power supply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
