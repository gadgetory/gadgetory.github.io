charts ever since its launch last fall
which makes perfect sense
it still has most of the things you love
about a flagship iPhone built in but for
$250 cheaper
who wouldn't buy an iPhone 10 our
Android fans but we loved the idea which
is why it's so cool that Google just
announced the mid-range pixel 3a and the
3/8 XL with a killer value proposition
same great camera an oled screen apple
and a freaking headphone jack maybe the
only bad news here is for google because
if this is as good as it sounds there
might not be much reason to buy the
flagship pixel anymore let's find out
right after we find out about our
sponsor pulse weight with pulse way you
can remotely monitor manage and control
all your Windows Mac and Linux machines
from one app create your free account
today at the link below
the first thing I noticed about the 3a
is how much it feels like a full-on
pixel device and and I'm a pixel 3 user
myself it has the same two-tone finish
available in just black clearly white
and a new color purple-ish the same
titanum security chip and all the pixel
only features like summoning Google
assistant with the squeeze storing
unlimited pictures and videos at high
quality in google photos and filtering
calls with Google's new call screen
feature with call screen your Google
assistant will help you screen your
calls so you know who's calling and why
look it's a prince he wants to make me
super rich but if we're comparing it to
the more expensive flagship pixel 3
devices just snort everything else about
this phone is kind of a same same but
different
the phones are close to the same size
and weight as their flagship
counterparts but they feel different and
that's because the body is polycarbonate
plastic instead of aluminium and glass
they still have stereo speakers but one
of them fires downward instead of both
of them being front firing and while
they have OLED always-on displays which
is a huge bonus that I wasn't expecting
since even apples budget 10 our uses of
LCD these use dragon trail glass from a
Japanese company instead of Gorilla
Glass 5 from corning from what we know
it's just a scratch resistant but not as
resistant to drops but we have to assume
that the dragon trail glass is one of
Google's cost-saving measures for this
mid-range device one area that Google
did not cut costs on was the resolution
and pixel density of the displays which
is fantastic at least on the smaller
pixel 3 and pixel 3 a unfortunately we
did not get similar parity on the XL
devices where the 3a excels pixel
density is quite a bit lower the thing
though is that some users might not even
notice the difference because the 3a
xl's pixel density is still higher than
that of the iPhone 10 our a device
that's explicitly branded as Retina spec
wise the 3a devices have 4 gigabytes of
RAM and base storage capacity of 64
gigabytes just like the flagships
however there are no 128 gig variants of
the 3/8 same same but different and
under the hood
continues the SOC has been downgraded
from the snapdragon 845 used on the
flagships to a snapdragon 670 but as
different as those two sound the two
actually have a lot in common both are
manufactured on the same 10 nanometer
process and both have eight cairo 360
cores with some performance cores
clocked at two gigahertz and some
efficiency cores clocked at 1.7 the big
difference is that the pixel 3 has a
50/50 split between efficiency and
performance course while the 3a gets 6
efficiency course and only 2 performance
ones its integrated GPU is an Adreno 615
with half the graphics memory but it was
still able to convince pub G to choose
high settings by default and round the
game really smoothly in our tests but I
don't think that most people buy pixels
for the gaming experience they buy them
for the OS which is the same great
Google customized clean Android Pi
experience on the new models and for the
camera and it looks like that's not
changing anytime soon you're gonna get
all the great pixel camera features like
nitesite super resume and even a new
time-lapse feature and for the most part
the experience is gonna be pretty darn
close the pixel 3a has nearly the same
rear camera as the flagship models so
the 12.2 megapixel dual pixel sony IMX
363 sensor is back but and this is
actually contrary to the leaks that came
up before launch is that the 3a does not
use the pixel visual core which is a
Google designed image processor that's
separate from the CPU this is something
that I thought was really gonna
differentiate this phone and give Google
an advantage because they can downgrade
the phone CPU to a mid tier one and
still have this awesome silicon that's
specialized in helping the camera
outperform the competition but it's not
here so I guess by the good pixel if you
want that if you're a selfie fiend
though you might be bummed out about the
front camera while the flagships have
both wide angles and telephoto cameras
for selfies the 3a has a single camera
that kind of splits the difference spec
wise as for video all pixel devices so
far are limited to 4k 30 on the rear
and 1080 30 on the front whereas the
iPhone 10 are conduce 60fps at either of
those resolutions and the 10 are clearly
pulled ahead when we ran our quick video
stabilization challenge it kept the
footage smooth but without making it
unnatural whereas the pixels introduced
some jitter and our huawei P 30 Pro
looked like it was mounted on the hood
of a car on a gravel road not good
enough so should you buy this phone well
I can't believe it took me this long to
mention it but it's kind of a big
selling point both the pixel 3a and the
3a XL Arunachala s-- phones they both
have headphone jacks and thanks to the
reduction in performance course along
with actually bigger batteries than the
flagship pixel threes they should get
you better battery life - all of that
with a very capable camera and for $400
less than the flagship to me they both
look like some of the strongest
mid-range options since the Nexus 5x and
that is some grade-a goodness you get
that 1 through 3 a grade-a do you get
you didn't get you get it now he hates
it but he doesn't hate dbrand
