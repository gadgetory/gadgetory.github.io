not to review the Apple watch yet not
because it isn't an important product or
because I couldn't get one or whatever
but because I felt like this piece of
technology straps to my wrist was in
such a state of early access that given
Apple's recent announcement of watch OS
2 I should probably just wait then I
realized that watch OS 2 is coming in
the fall and Apple legitimately expect
people to buy this thing and use it for
months before those improvements
materialized so while I might still take
another crack at it with more emphasis
on functionality once that software
update arrives I've definitely got some
words to say in the meantime
Corsair delivers real neck art oh here I
have one huh real neck or nothing with
their new strafe mechanical keyboard
featuring genuine German made Cherry MX
key switches click on Munchen to learn
more I'm gonna move my chin now just the
three for loop I know I know I've teased
this one before but I'm really releasing
it soon this time drop a like on the
video if you want to see us build a PC
inside a mini fridge it's gonna be
awesome for today though the Apple watch
it's available in an umpteen bajillion
different model so let's start with some
of the things that differ between them
you can get a 38 millimeter or 42
millimeter face to suit your wrist size
a 350 dollar two seventeen thousand
dollar price tag to suit your wallet
size a variety of construction materials
ranging from aluminum with ionics glass
on the sport models to stainless or gold
with sapphire crystal glass on the more
premium ones and enough strap options to
choke a horse ranging from plastic to
leather to stainless steel then there's
the similarities there are body sensors
on the bottom of all models in fact the
hardware is identical down to a mere
eight gigabytes of on-board storage
actually kind of funny if you think
about it
they've all got two buttons a lower one
for frequent contacts and the upper
crown for bringing up the home screen
and for scrolling vertically which is a
funny throwback to my blackberry days
actually funnier still because it comes
from Apple the inventor of momentum
based touch on everything because scroll
wheels anyway though I picked up a 38
millimeter Apple watch non sport non
edition with a Milanese loop band
because I thought it looked kind of cool
so some of my comments will be specific
to this SKU but most of my feedback will
be general observations about Apple's
first wearable that is to say if you
don't count tricked-out iPod nanos the
fit and finish of the Apple watch isn't
perfect my crown button is a little
spongy er than it should be especially
when you got a double tap it sometimes
but overall I would say it's outstanding
its world's better than the Moto 360 the
shining hope for Android wear
enthusiasts who wanted a really premium
feeling option and it makes the LG G
watch are still my personal favorite
SmartWatch feel like a geek
gadget rather than a piece of jewelry
particularly because of its plastic
screen and you know what maybe that's
the point here isn't it
if we evaluate the Apple watch as a
smart wrist-mounted wearable a category
that it appears to be trying to invent
in spite of arriving somewhat late to
the party it falls short of the
functionality delivered by smaller
companies months or even years ago and
if we evaluate it as a watch you know a
timepiece then I don't know about you
but the fact that I can't check the time
with a discreet glance at my arm when
cornered by a talkative neighbor or
during an unsatisfactory sexual
encounter where I'm on the bottom
without it being extremely obvious that
I'm bored is simply unacceptable I mean
sure it can be woken a number of ways by
gesturing double tapping or pressing the
crown but if a real watch company
released a watch that required any of
that kind of to find out what time it is
we blast them out of town which doesn't
mean that it's all bad it's a very
forward-thinking product and I'll say
more on that later but for now
navigation with subtle vibes when turns
are coming up is solid the wireless
charger is a nice finally Apple
inclusion the ability to set the watch
face time a few minutes ahead felt like
they really designed this product for me
personally phone conversations are
surprisingly easy to hold with the on
watch speaker and microphone with
FaceTime support coming and the 272 by 3
40 pixel OLED display a first for Apple
is very sharp with retina class pixel
density and super high contrast making
it easy to read in pretty much any
condition and easy to forget where the
LCD ends and the border begins gorgeous
it's just too bad that the battery life
sucks the big one without enabling power
Reserve which lasts a very long time but
turns off literally all functionality
other than pressing a button to show the
time the Apple watch couldn't even make
it past lunch on the second day both
times I forgot to charge and this is
with what I would consider very moderate
use there are just so many compromises
in this product that all come back to
battery
gesturing to turn on the screen no
always listening hey Siri the
lightning-fast display timeout when I
pause to think for a second while using
it the fact that the watch only buzzes
and avoids turning on the display at all
to show incoming notifications I mean
that last one is what iOS lord it over
Android for so long Apple knew that that
was important years ago but simply
couldn't overcome the engineering
challenges or at least not in a way that
wouldn't force them to compromise on the
design or vision for this product to
make that a reality because that's what
happened here just like those early
flash based iPods that held like 50
songs and seemed like a pathetic
replacement for the hard drive based
models that help thousands Apple is
making moves six steps ahead of their
opponents they could have pulled out
Wi-Fi or reduced the performance of the
Apple watch's SOC to make it a more
sensible and well-rounded product today
but instead they've set the internal
goal of what a SmartWatch should be a
computer on the wrist and now they're
just planning a waiting game until the
product they want can actually be
manufactured and I see why they did it
because what comes first the chicken the
you know interactive computer on your
wrist that Apple is trying to build or
the egg the software that will run on
that computer and make it functional
either one of them is useless without
the other and Apple can't sit and wait
forever while developers only work on
you know Android wear or pebble stuff so
they launched what is essentially a
development kit a product that can be
coded for that's functionally the same
as what's coming and that allows Apple
to collect valuable customer feedback
like hey it shouldn't take two touches
to dismiss notification hey being able
to interact with hangouts or Gmail
messages in addition to iMessage would
be cool hey starting navigation with
Ceres shouldn't require me to touch the
device which is super inconvenient when
I'm on a motorcycle hey this thing is
useless as a music promote one of the
only things I do with my SmartWatch
until it defaults to music control on
wake when I'm playing music and supports
third party media apps like solos and
play music but one that we'll see
like an early adopter toy once the one
with the always-on display not to
mention always listening Siri and stuff
like that arrives
okay so then Linus should everyone who
bought one feel like an idiot well I'd
say it depends why they bought it if
they bought it to have a great
SmartWatch then yes if they bought it as
a fitness tracker especially the one I
got that's telling me I'm progressing in
my walking workout when I'm sitting
writing this review and slips off from
sweat when I play badminton then yes if
they bought it as a fashion accessory
that looks good shockingly on both men
and women with the same design way to go
Apple and that like white earbuds in the
mm tells the people around them how hip
and cool they are then I guess not I
mean I've seen first hand it's a killer
conversation starter and not just with
my fellow geeks like my other
smartwatches so the answer to that one
then is that the value is in the eye of
the beholder and while many will find
better bang for the buck in a $20 sport
watch the Apple watch delivers at the
very least an unassailably better value
proposition than like a high-fashion
pair of shoes or something they'll both
be simply dreadful and you won't want to
be seen in public with them in a year
but at least the Apple watch will do
something in the meantime and why don't
you do something about paying too much
for your mobile bill ting calm that's
the mobile carrier that's focused on
customer service why speak to a robot
when you call your cell phone provider
you can get put through directly to a
person with ting and you pay only for
what you use with the average team bill
clocking in at only about $24 per month
per device and if you're stuck with a
contract you can switch to ting and
they'll cover 25% of your cancellation
fee up to 75 bucks so head to Linus
ENCOM and try their savings calculator
where you enter your last few bills and
find out hey would I actually be saving
money on ting or not don't take my word
for it do that and also if you use our
link you get $25 and service credit or
towards a new device that's a nice
little bonus as well thanks for watching

computer it's not that tiny
well it's pretty tiny depends on how you
define tiny it's bigger than this one
but also quite a bit more functional
