PCs visit Corsair comm / obsidian to
learn more welcome to a graphics card
dinner theater with your host linus the
tech tips guy this video is all about
the graphics card that looks exactly
like the other graphics cards this is
the geforce gtx 770 from nvidia and as
you may or may not have noticed based on
looking at it or based on what i just
said it looks pretty much identical to
the gtx titan and the gtx 780 however
that is pretty much where the
similarities end in terms of performance
because this graphics card is based on
the GK 104 GPU the same GPU that the GTX
670 and 680 were based on now hold on
before you go - hold on stop that means
that it's a rebadge it is sort of a
rematch but it is an enhanced rebadge it
is an updated graphics card so what
they've done is they've taken a full
fledged GK 104 GPU just like you find on
the GTX 680 paired that with seven
gigabit per second so seven gigahertz
gddr5 memory so faster memory and then
they've added some new technology GPU
boost 2.0 the updated cooler as you've
already seen as well as their new fan
profile that makes the card quieter
while running cool due to GPU boost -
now that's all fine and good but you
kind of go well - it looks really
expensive how much does it cost actually
less than a GTX 680 used - this is
coming in to fill the gap that GTX 670
is leaving behind because that card will
be going away to be replaced by the gtx
770 without further ado let's get into
the performance for using our standard
test bench you can check out the specs
on the slide that's in front of me right
now we're using the latest beta drivers
from both the red team and the green
team as well as EVGA precision for all
of our GeForce overclocking and
si afterburner for all of our Radeon
overclocking the reason for that is we
found that precision when we started our
testing at least had better support for
GPU core offsets
now speaking of GPU core offsets this
graphics card uses GPU boost too which
means that overclocking is a little bit
different if you check out my gtx titan
overclocking guide you will know how to
overclock the gtx 770 we run all of our
cards overclocked
and i think what you're going to see is
we had a bit of an anomaly that i
believe will be smoothed out very very
quickly but what you're going to see in
our performance testing is that the 770
really didn't separate itself from the
gtx 680 in fact it fell behind in some
of our tests which was confusing until
we looked into how our GPU boost 2 was
behaving and it looks like on this
particular card it wasn't boosting up
very high remember guys GPU boost is a
variable thing one card may boost up
more than another and the spec is based
on typical GPU boost so it looks like
once overclocked our 680 had a very
favorable core clock
whereas our 770 was not boosting up as
much or as consistently in spite of the
fact that they were being run in a room
with the same temperatures so your
mileage may vary here but without
further ado let's get into the games
Metro last light is our first game up
and you can tell where the performance
comes from in this game it comes from
memory bandwidth the top two cards are
GTX Titan and GTX 780 and they are so
far ahead of everything else about 30
percent faster than anything else that
is even trying to run this game next
you've got the GTX 770 remember that 7
gigahertz gddr5 that's making a
difference in spite of its 256-bit
memory bus it still pulls ahead by an
ever so small edge against the 79 70 and
79 50 from AMD and then if you look at
the 686 70 and 660ti they really fall
behind because they are not using the
same advanced memory that you find on
the 770 in Tomb Raider we once again see
GTX Titan and GTX 780
just run away with it then we see a
clustering of cards that's all pretty
much within margin of error are six 80s
in there are seven 70s in there are 79
70s in there are 79 50s in there and
only the 670 and the 660ti really fall
behind in this particular benchmark in
Crysis 3 we're going to see that same
pattern again with the Titan that 780
and then everything else except the
660ti where we really see it fall behind
compared to the other cards this is
becoming a bit of a pattern here and
it's probably going to continue in
BioShock Infinite same story guys so we
see the GTX Titan in GTX 780 really run
away with this one with a very tight
clustering of pretty much everything
else behind them with the 660ti bringing
up the rear again due to its more cut
down design compared to the 6 70s and
680 and 770 which are all very similar
specs at this point in time with the 770
having the best back but once again
having that anomaly that we've observed
with our particular card running GPU
boost once again in Far Cry 3 we see the
Titan and the GTX 780 really run away
with it and everything else is very very
tightly packed within about a 10 percent
spread after that with the gtx 660ti
really falling away bearing in mind of
course that a 660ti is significantly
less expensive than most of the other
cards that are in that starter that top
tier I'm going to combine this last
graph with my conclusion because I think
this graph pretty much sums it up GTX
Titan and GTX 780 are here everything
else is here
so the GTX 770 is a very evolutionary
step forward in terms of performance yes
it performs better than a 670 yes it's
less expensive than a 680 it looks
better it has a more updated feature set
and vidi has rolled out GeForce
experience which updates your drivers
for you as well as gives you
recommendations for how to run your
games these are all fantastic things
that are good it has an illuminated
GeForce GTX logo on the top which I
can't get over and
I love makes your system look awesome it
makes you feel good about the purchase
it feel solid you know metal aluminum
crafted think it's really really nice
however the GTX 780 is the one that
really looks like the compelling value
to me because even though it's extremely
expensive we're talking about you know
well over $500 graphics card that's the
one where you're getting nearly that
tightened performance which is the cream
of the crop when it comes to a single
GPU nothing touches it I mean you've
seen from these graphs nothing's even
close except the GTX 780 and the GTX 780
costs significantly less than a GTX
Titan so a would I go for the gtx 770 or
would i pony up for a gtx 780 I think I
would personally probably save my
pennies and go for the 780 I wouldn't
jump all the way up to the Titan because
you can see for that extra money you're
spending you're not getting that much
more of a performance increase but
that's that sweet spot right there that
the 780 hits then if I didn't get a 780
imight run around and look for maybe a
hot deal on a 670 or a 660ti that's
quite overclockable or something along
those lines if I didn't want to spend
that much and save myself a few bucks
so the 770 will come into its own I
think once those older cards are cleared
out because there's always clearance hot
deals when a new generation of cards
comes in and I think that pretty much
wraps it up thank you for checking out
my 1080p performance review of the GTX
770 don't forget to check out my
unboxing as well as my 1440p performance
review because I think you guys will be
surprised at how that extra memory
bandwidth helps this card when you're
running at higher resolutions don't
