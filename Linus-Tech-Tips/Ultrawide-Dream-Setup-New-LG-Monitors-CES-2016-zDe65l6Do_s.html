brought to you by Squarespace build it
beautiful here in the lg monitor booth
we've got a few things to get to before
the main event so first we've got the 27
UD 88 this is a creator oriented 27-inch
4k display and the big thing here is not
necessarily the 99% srgb the well
obviously 4k IPS panel but rather the
fact that it features USB type-c
connectivity so the laptop next to it
which is the LG gram a pretty cool piece
of technology in its own right is not
only outputting to the monitor at 4k
resolution through that single type-c
connector but it is also being charged
by the power plug that it the monitor is
using from the wall pretty freakin cool
I should take a moment and actually talk
about the Graham very briefly here this
thing is sick it's like MacBook Air type
thin but a whole other level of light
it's 2.2 pounds with a core i5 or Core
i7 processor 8 gigs of ram in a 256 or
512 gig SSD pricing is not available yet
but I will definitely be watching this
one pretty closely which now brings us
over to the 27 you d68 this is a more
gaming oriented model unfortunately it's
still only 60 Hertz but thanks to its 4k
resolution that's pretty much all you're
going to be able to drive with a modern
display interface anyway so what makes
this puppy gaming is the fact that it
features AMD freesync technology so with
a supported AMD GPU you're not gonna
have to deal with the leg or tearing
associated with more traditional
solutions for when the GPU is outputting
a framerate that is not synchronous with
the refresh rate of the display that
leads us over to the centerpiece of the
show here the 34 you see 98 it's fairly
similar to LG's previous 97 with a
couple of key differences so it's still
34 40 by 1440 34 inch 21 by 9 aspect
ratio it's got a couple 2 HDMI inputs a
DisplayPort input it's got a USB 3
it's got Thunderbolt pass-through that's
actually really cool Thunderbolt 2
passed through for daisy-chaining but
the main differences are the ID it now
features a metal stand that actually
looks and feels quite a bit better the
fact that it now has height adjust
something that was on the business model
but not the more consumer-oriented one
and finally it's got AMD freesync which
is better for eliminating tearing in
games within that freesync variable
refresh rate window which leads us
finally to the centerpiece of the
monitor display here three of those free
sync enabled gaming monitors in a what
would you call this like mega uber ultra
wide setup with the theme around it
being ultra wide dream setup so if you
guys weren't paying attention like
entirely over the last couple of months
we worked with LG on a really really
cool like almost like a festival that
they did around ultra wide monitors they
gave away like 30 of their 34 inch ultra
wide 's they gave away three $10,000
beam setups and that whole thing
actually concluded not that long ago
with me doing a livestream of the build
for riland who ended up winning ours
there were a couple of other influences
including Jehovah Witness a gamer and
unbox therapy and unboxer slash
lifestyle expert he's meant that guy is
a lot cooler than me unfortunately and
the finalized videos are finally up so
if you haven't had enough of checking
out LG's monitors and the whole ultra
wide concept here with our booth
coverage then make sure you checked out
the link in the video description so you
can see those finalists showing off
their finished setups after all this
