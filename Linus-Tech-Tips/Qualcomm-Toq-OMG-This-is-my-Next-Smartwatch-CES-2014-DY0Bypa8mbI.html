brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital we're here with the
Qualcomm Talk SmartWatch is this
something I'm actually pretty excited
about and I've been trying to get my
hands on one hopefully we're gonna make
a full review happen soon but in the
meantime this is my first time actually
touching it and I'm pretty impressed
with the overall fit and finish as you
guys know I'm a bit of a pebble
aficionado and if you're gonna try and
convince me to spend double on one of
these you're gonna have to give me
something that has a better ID and more
functionality so let's jump into the
industrial design first it's got an
adjustable band which is kind of a
rubberized material it doesn't look like
there's an obvious way to change it out
and I suspect that's not going to be
something you're gonna want to do
because there are actually two touch
sensitive buttons surfaces on the band
itself so the top one double-clicking it
will turn your backlight on or off and
the bottom one acts as a back button as
well as a way to switch between all of
your sub menus or just your watch face
now when you're on the standard watch
face you can go ahead and swipe the
bottom to switch between them I'm sure
there will be customized ones coming
later but the SDK for the talk isn't
coming until early 2014 for the strap
itself you just pop open the latch you
can adjust it according to the size you
need with the holes on the side and then
you are pretty much ready to rock I mean
it's a watch strap it's not that much to
go wrong charging wise this is one of my
complaints about the pebble and one of
my complaints about a lot of mobile
devices in general is cables
there's microUSB which is fragile and
then there's proprietary cables which
are easy to lose and expensive to
replace the talk does use a proprietary
sort of charging dock solution that you
go ahead and you stick it on
but it's Wireless so at least it's
convenient it lives somewhere it lives
on your nightstand you get home you
crawl into bed you put it on there and
you're pretty much good to go to me
wireless charging is sort of the holy
grail of smart devices in terms of
making them something that I'd be likely
to actually use every day now let's walk
through the functionality here so the
first thing we're gonna do is we're
gonna tap the bottom and we can see our
comm hub which gives us notifications
and gives us a log of everything that we
have done on this phone pretty much now
of course you don't have to go into the
comm hub if you get a call or a text
message or what
else those will come up automatically as
you get calls but of course this isn't
synched to my phone at the moment
calendar shows you everything that's
going on today and tomorrow music can be
used to control your mp3 player as long
as it's you know built into a Bluetooth
capable device it's not magic guys
weather shows you the weather stalk show
you the stock status is a cool one so
you can see the connected phone as well
as battery life you can turn your
phone's rigueur on and off using your
SmartWatch
it is only Android right now but I've
been I've overheard that there's talks
about iOS but nothing concrete one way
or the other
you can also ping your phone by clicking
on fine phone settings is pretty
self-explanatory Bluetooth airplane mode
as well as software update and finally
your notifications so you can see any
notifications whether it's from USA
Today or whatever else that happens to
be like I said the SDK is coming later
guys so we can expect a lot more
functionality here now the last thing
and this is a big highlight of the
device is the Mirasol display something
I've never seen in person before now the
e-ink display on the pebble is in my
opinion one of the strongest things
about that device because it enables for
me about four days but they're saying
for most people about seven days of
battery life to me a watch has to be
visible without a gesture where I lifted
up to my face it has to always be
visible now Mirasol takes fatty ink
advantage of battery life and adds color
and it also adds excellent performance
I'd say probably even better just
looking at it in direct sunlight maybe
may be similar but you're getting color
you're getting that long battery life
and let's check this out it also takes a
reflected light that comes from the
space around you so when you're in a
very bright environment it can be very
difficult to read a digital display so
you got the backlight for dark and then
you've got the actual reflectiveness
behind the screen to take care of that
so we're gonna do what they're calling
the talk challenge or something like
that and we're gonna take our camera and
b-roll here we're going to dial it in to
read the talk Smart Watch correctly in
direct sunlight then I'm gonna put my
phone up next to it on maximum
brightness and we're gonna see how they
both look in direct sunlight one way or
another guys I'm extremely excited to
check this out and in a more in-depth
sort of manner and I appreciate them
being here at the show so we can check
it out all right so thank you for
checking out this video here at CES 2014
remember our trip to the show is powered
by NCI XCOM your source for great
technology selection and service as well
as Coursera memory
Western Digital without them we wouldn't
be able to be here bringing you guys
