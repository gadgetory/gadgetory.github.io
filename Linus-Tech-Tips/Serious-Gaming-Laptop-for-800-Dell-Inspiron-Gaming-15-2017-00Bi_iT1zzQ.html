inspiron 75 59 from last year where I
gave it a solid recommendation for its
wolf in sheep's clothing wicked gaming
performance and it's understated looks
not to mention price now over the last
year dell has been hard at work tweaking
that formula and they've even gone as
far this time as to include gaming in
the product name but have those tweaks
actually added up to anything
substantial let's check it out
Brow's privately and securely with
tunnel bear the simple VPN app try
tunnel bear for free at the link in the
video description the inspiring gaming
has a red matte finish with mean-looking
triangles on the front and the back
hexagons are very 2016 as I've been
recently informed it mostly avoids an
over-the-top look like some gaming
laptops but it is red though if that's
too shouting for you there's a black
version available as well it's clear
that thinness wasn't a top priority for
Dell here with lesser specs than the
latest MacBook Pro it's nearly double
the thickness but assuming they use the
extra space for cooling I can't be too
critical especially if the intent is for
users to game on it for long periods at
a time the build quality is great for a
budget segment laptop the chassis feels
solid and the screen flexes about what
you'd expect opening the lid is easy and
the hinge moves smoothly if you took
this thing 10 years back in time and
told someone it costs less than $1000
they wouldn't believe you we've come a
long way the i/o is more traditional
than most laptops these days as well
it's unlikely that you'll have to reach
for a dongle though I will say at least
having the option for a type C or
Thunderbolt port on a premium config
would have been welcome our model is not
the cheapest but it hits a really nice
sweet spot with just enough of pretty
much everything for gaming and without
spending extra money on an i7 for
example that doesn't make games run
faster I mean that money could go
towards buying books or beer and gaming
performance is really solid
the included 60 Hertz TN panel looks
pretty good for a TN with above-average
viewing angles from side to side again
for TN and on high settings at 1080p
which happens to be its native
resolution this laptop plowed through
our test lineup comfortably meaning that
in between homework and Facebook you
should be able to run modern triple-a
titles without issue thanks in no small
part to the strong performance of the
Inspiron gaming's cooling system during
our I 264 stress test it was not only
able to keep the CPU at a relatively
comfortable 80 degrees but the i5 was
able to use its turbo boost the whole
time - meaning performance won't dip
after a couple of minutes of gaming it
was far from silent but wasn't
disruptive and it's much quieter than a
thin and light gaming machine like a
razor blade and if that sounds good to
you you'll be happy to know the speakers
are better than you might expect as well
the internal subwoofer doesn't add as
much depth to the sound as the subs in
their XPS laptops several years ago did
but overall clarity is good until some
distortion creeps in at nearly full
volume as long as you're right in front
they're highly directional so if a
diminished off-axis movie watching
experience is a real turnoff for your
friend you might not be doing any
chilling while you Netflix though even
if you have to be by yourself
at least you'll be doing it for a long
time battery life came in at a very
impressive six hours and 48 minutes one
of the best results we've ever seen in
our PC mark work benchmark and more good
news just like its predecessor it's easy
to get inside all it takes is one screw
okay I'll stop that now
and as an SSD only model ours has a
completely free hard drive bay with
mounting hardware and a cable included
as well as an empty Ram slot Dell really
couldn't make this any easier moving
back to the outside the keyboard feels
very similar to previous Inspiron models
but nicer the keystrokes are short with
a pleasant click and avoid being mushy
spacing is a strong point and there's a
full numpad with appropriately laid out
arrow keys the red backlighting isn't
bright enough to be having an inspire
and inspired dance party with it or
anything but it's functional
and if you're actually in the dark
you'll be able to read the keys can't
complain
the trackpad is also quite good the feel
of the click isn't super consistent from
the top to the bottom but it performs
accurately at high sensitivity settings
and it does a great job of figuring out
when I have my thumb at the bottom for
clicking as opposed to when I'm trying
to use multi-touch now let's talk about
what you are not getting with a value
model like this the first unfortunate
compromise is the 1x1 Wi-Fi giving me a
maximum speed of around 20 megabytes per
second in my data transfer test so if
you want fast downloads you will have to
wire in the storage is also rather slow
it is an MDOT to drive and it is an SSD
but it runs at SATA speeds not PCIe
speeds and finally the screen is far
from the most vibrant and high contrast
that I've seen now that IPS is the
standard even a decent TN looks washed
out by comparison so who is this laptop
for then well unsurprisingly the dell
inspiron gaming is a great value laptop
for people who want to game and need the
portability of a laptop for 850 bucks
you could build a better performing
desktop that is more upgradable but you
can't exactly take that to class or
wherever it is that you might need it so
if you're looking for something to buy
that's inexpensive and works well before
heading off to university or college the
inspiring gaming packs everything that
you're likely to need into a pretty nice
little container or box fresh books
these guys are awesome but it's not
about how they're awesome it's about how
you're awesome if you're running a
business whether it's you know a dance
studio out of your garage or plumbing or
small-time computer repair you probably
would like to be spending your time
being awesome teaching people to dance
fixing computers and not spending your
time tooling around with complicated
accounting software FreshBooks lets you
organize your time by allowing you to
track expenses
work hours send out invoices accept
payments through the platform and even
see when a client has seen your invoice
putting an end to guessing games so
