trusted graphics partner Nvidia welcome
to another Linus tech tips video where
we have a pretty exciting comparison for
you guys we're going to be doing the FX
8350 overclocked versus the core i5 35
70 K also overclocked now our
methodology for this is actually let's
do test bench first so test bench wise
we've got equivalent boards so across
their 5 formula and then a Maximus 5
formula these are both ROG top-tier well
I'm not quite but almost talk to your
gaming boards from a Seuss we've got
mush King Copperhead 1600 Ram now these
look kind of special but they're not
really anything special in terms of the
spec they're just regular CL 9 1600
megahertz memory for our GPU we've
decided to go with the gtx 660ti because
it's one of those well it's very very
very popular it's one of those ones
where if you're buying a gaming system
of this tier this is pretty much the
graphics card that we'd recommend that
you put in it we're using a vertex 4 for
our operating system and we're running
all of our games off of a nice cozy
drive over the network
we are cooled by an H 100 which is what
allows us to hit these overclocked
frequencies and other than that I think
we're good to go so the CPU should be
pretty self-explanatory our 8350 we
scoured the internets for both the 8350
and the 35 70 K to find out what the
overclock that 95% of people were going
to be able to obtain so we didn't go for
as the best that we could do on these
chips it was based on what we know you
guys are going to be able to do so there
might look a little conservative so our
8350 is clocked at 4.6 gigahertz and our
35 70 K is clocked at 4.2 gigahertz
because we consider those pretty much
guaranteed numbers so this video is
going to focus on Windows 7 we are going
to do a number of different videos about
this in different scenarios so this is
Windows 7 without maxing out the game
sort of like crazy this is sort of how
we would probably actually run them so
many of the games are run without
anti-aliasing because I personally don't
like it I do find there's more input lag
when I run onto you
is saying so you take that for what it
is but why are we running these tests
these two CPUs are sort of widely
regarded as well the 3570 is the only
choice for gamers so out there on the
forums and logan from tech syndicate
actually released a video showing that
the 8350 was competitive or even beat
the 3570 in many games not only that but
Crysis 3 recently came out with several
publications saying that the 8350
performed better than a 35 70k in that
particular game so we were like ok well
we have the hardware we have the time
sort of slick has the time and so let's
run these tests let's find out what's
going on here
so let's start with Starcraft 2
Starcraft 2 we have a pretty CPU
intensive benchmark our benchmarking
guide for Starcraft 2 is available if
you click the video annotation here
go check it out you can run our
benchmark for yourself pretty CPU
intensive and the 35 70 K kind of runs
away with this one now you can see the
average frame rates on the graph right
here minimum frame rates were pretty
much the same story with the 35 70 K
coming in at 57 minimum and the 83 50
coming in at 42 minimum however it
should be noted that these this game is
playable regardless of whether you're
running at 40 or 57 FPS but it is a big
performance difference about 30% all
right next up we've got Far Cry 3 so
this is a new game running on CryEngine
3 and we saw very very similar
performance between the 35 70 K in the
80 350 at our overclocks pretty much the
same and this was true of the minimum
frame rates as well so it was 43 for the
83 50 and 44 FPS minimum for the 35 70 K
so the no I mean there's like those
reports about CryEngine 3 favoring AMD
architectures and multi-threading and
all that good stuff may be true because
our 3770 performed a lot better than the
35 70 K in Far Cry 3 so more threads
more better Crysis 3 similar story again
with the averages now this this was kind
of a funny one the averages were almost
the same which is what you guys see but
the minimum for the 8350 dip down to 20
well
for the 3570 dip down to 29 now this was
rerun a couple of times we did validate
it but it's just one of those things
where it might have been a bit of an
anomaly just kind of some weird thing
but there you go so averages look very
similar moving along the battlefield 3
we've got pretty much a neck-and-neck
dead heat but the 8350 edges out the 35
70k in averages but not in terms of the
minimum so the minimums were a little
bit lower for the 8350 in skyrim it
should be noted that our Skyrim run has
18 mods from the Steam Workshop so guys
if you start I can't get the same
results as us and Skyrim that's probably
why
but the 35 70k did put up a pretty good
show against the 83 50 in this one
beating it handily and the minimum frame
rates were about 50 FPS on the 35 70
versus 40 on the 83-54 dirt3 well this
game ran really well on both CPUs to the
point where it almost doesn't really
matter anymore but the 35 70k does edged
out the 83 50 again witcher 2 gorgeous
game demanding game DirectX 9 game and
I'm surprised every time I see this but
in this one it was a clear win for the
thirty-five seventy seventy six point
eight versus seventy one point one
however the minimums were more telling
for this one with the 35 70k getting
about 60 FPS minimum and the 8350
getting about 50 FPS minimum metro 2033
was another 35 70 K win but it looks a
little bigger than it actually was
because the minimum frames were actually
very very similar in this game and that
represents more of a playability
difference than average frames per
second for most gamers Crysis 2 is our
last one to wrap things up and this is
another clear win for the 35 70 K with
76 verses 68 FPS and a minimum that's
about 10 frames per second higher so
conclusion wise in all of this newer
game engines such as CryEngine 3 which
is what Far Cry 3 and Crysis 3 running
seem to be starting to favor
multi-threading more so the 83 50 is an
8 core processor depending on how you
look at it exactly whereas the 35 70 is
a purely
or core processor so as we move forward
we'll the 8350 continue to become a more
valid gaming CPU I think the answer is
yes it has higher power consumption and
it does run hotter than the 35 70 K but
right now in current games that don't
leverage all those CPU cores it performs
well enough I mean there's no game where
the 83 50 was the difference between
playable and not playable we didn't
encounter that except in Crysis 3 where
we had that one dip but that looked like
a bit of an anomaly even late I don't
know what to say about that
but moving forward the 8350 might begin
to be able to flex its muscle a little
bit more especially with all of the news
about PlayStation 4 having an x86
multi-core processor in it who knows
even though every PC game tends to be a
console port these days looking at you
game developers it may actually be
beneficial for processors like the 8350
to have that console presence so there
you go folks we're going to follow up
this video with an anti-aliasing one as
well as a platform comparison on windows
8 to see how on the very latest Windows
platform these two CPUs compare against
each other thanks for checking out this
