brought to you by Western Digital Intel
and steel series so we're here in the
courser booth again amidst some very
mixed company there's like some guy over
there he's kind of he's kind of got like
a tall dark and evil look about him I
don't know what's at the night what to
make of that guy anyway let's move on to
what course there's announcing in terms
of headsets they have a whole heck of a
lot going on here this is the Vengeance
2100 which is an evolutionary step
forward from the vengeance 2000 so it's
still wireless it has an updated ID so
it's got like a metal coating on here
that looks really sharp but like a nice
brushed look very dark look to it the
same comfortable ergonomic sort of nice
soft cushions memory foam and all that
good stuff soft cushion headband but
more than anything else it has been
updated for better durability so it is
even more robust than before and the
drivers that used to be in the vengeance
2000 which were a little bit better than
what we found in the 1500 in the 1300
are still here but with the new 1500 v2
which has dolby 7.1 it has the newer
drivers that we're in the vengeance 2000
as well as an updated ID that looks in
my personal opinion much sharper they've
also updated the the pinching pressure
the clamping pressure on your head so it
should provide a good mixture of comfort
and well staying this the Vengeance 1400
is an update on the Vengeance 1300 that
adds those better drivers updates the ID
once again for those who don't know ID
means industrial design so the look of
it and other than that so it should just
sound better in general and look better
in general and these two are all new
these are prototypes right now this is
the Raptor HS 40 and HS 30 so the HS 40
is a USB headset just like the 1500 it
has surround but not dolby
aims at sort of a lower cost lower cost
gamer market so it has 40 millimeter
drivers instead of 50 millimeter drivers
and a bit of a sort of more value
oriented overall build quality show no
no memory foam it's using a leatherette
instead of microfiber cloth and then the
HS 30 is an analog version of pretty
much more and the same they've got like
a very angular shape to the side here
that looks quite sharp oh I missed
actually one thing on these ones over
here is that the inline volume control
has been updated to be less bulky on
both the 1,500 be too and on the 1400s
so there you go guys don't miss any of
our pax prime 2013 coverage don't forget
to subscribe to Linus tech tips and a
huge thanks to our sponsors western
digital Intel and steelseries for
allowing us to be here this year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
