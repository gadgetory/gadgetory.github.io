very interesting unboxing but thermal
paste is important without a thermal
paste your system just plain wouldn't
work and Arctic cooling makes some of
the best thermal paste on the market
there mx1
turned the entire thermal paste market
which is I mean it's small but turn the
entire thermal paste market on its ear
because it was the best performing one
out there and it was a non metallic
compound so previously the the best
regarded thermal paste out there was
Arctic silver 5 I mean there were some
more exotic things but it was generally
acknowledged that without metal content
a thermal paste couldn't be a top
performer like I said mx1
turned that all around and this is the
fourth iteration of their MX series of
thermal compounds MX one had some
disadvantages one was it was extremely
thick it was very hard to spread which
made it kind of inconvenient to apply
and MX to address that so Arctic cooling
keeps taking their product which has
consistently been a top performer in the
marketplace and improving it so MX for
right here features a syringe with a cap
whoa look at that high technology and AD
viewing holes so you can see how much
mx4 is left in the syringe without any
difficulty okay so incredibly they don't
compare MX 4 to their previous
generation MX 3 although they do compare
it against a bunch of other products on
the market lower is obviously better for
cooling and they show it against upper
limit AK PK 1 gallon GC to collaborate
cool laboratory liquid ultra that was
one of those exotic solutions that used
to be quite well-regarded okay it is a
non metallic thermal compound which
means is non conductive non capacitive
even if you get it all over your stuff
which is still not recommended because
total mess to clean up it will not ruin
anything on that performance so they're
saying it is the highest performance for
me
available durability it is non curing
and non bleeding which means it does not
need to be replaced for up to eight
years and if your system is actually
eight years old and you haven't done
anything with it well it's probably time
to you know think about doing something
different anyway that's another
disadvantage of older thermal compounds
was that they needed to replayed be
replaced every couple years or they
would actually dry up or they would and
not be usable anymore non curing also
means that it doesn't have a period
where it's not fully functional yet like
I said some of the older thermal
compounds did have disadvantages one of
them was that they wouldn't be a hundred
percent of their total performance until
they had been through a couple of
heating up and cooling down cycles so
mx1
and any of the later generation MX
products do not have that disadvantage
so it's recommended for CPU GPU and any
power semiconductor components so
basically anything that produces heat
and has a heat sink you want to put this
between it don't forget to subscribe to
