sending us to pax nice 2016 this year if
you want to see all of their different
products and services check them out in
the video description down below alright
guys we are not at a booth per se this
is the BYOC section pax in Seattle pax
in Boston pax in Texas
pax in Australia all of them have like a
LAN area there's the land free play
section there's the console free play
section and there's the BYOC section
which stands for bring your own computer
it's actually really cool I've been
doing it for a little while now with
some of my friends in pact Seattle this
was the first time I have done PAX East
and what we're going to check out is the
top three modded computers of the
b-y-o-see section and they're pretty
sick we're going to start off with a
system that is close to my heart I love
fish tank systems my like claim to fame
in terms of building computers was in a
fish tank system because I filled it
with oil this one is done in a different
way but equally as cool in my opinion so
this system was built by polish you can
see his name in the front bottom right
hand corner and is not filled with oil
is not actually filled with any liquid
at all except for the little smaller
inner tank area which houses his fish
which is named alpha the beta which is
like super great I absolutely love that
in terms of hardware he has the Intel
Core 2 Duo anniversary edition a 960
which is reference blower cooled so that
it can get the air out of the fish tank
so it doesn't just fish around on the
inside pun intended
he's got fish rocks all over the place
which actually helps them hide his
cables which is super smart I wish I did
that with my rig it's a really good idea
also on the bottom left-hand side under
the rock behind the polish badge is a
hard drive and below that is where he
hides his SSD amongst the rocks on the
bottom in and outside of the fish
containing area he has little fake fish
plants and the whole thing just looks
aesthetically awesome in terms of
lighting he has to cathode lights in the
top which are actually hidden behind the
black plastic band among the outside
which is a really cool way to do that
and it's kind of hidden under the top of
the lid as well all of the i/o goes out
of the top which is probably what you
would expect from a fish tank build and
I just absolutely love it easily one of
my favourite mods I've ever seen and
then you have how its put together so
for my fish tank build which you can see
up here or for the one that we did for
work
later on which you can also see up here
we use like laser-cut Plexiglas panels
what he did was actually a much more
effective way in my opinion to be
completely honest he just velcroed on
one of those kind of Bitcoin mining
motherboard trays that people were
building for quite a while there that I
think you can get from high-speed PC I
don't know where he got his and then
yeah it just velcroed it on in terms of
his motherboard to keep it in place he's
a little angle bracket on the bottom and
then another little bit of velcro on the
top just to hold it in smart effective
cheap next up we actually have two
computers as kind of one feature that
I'm going to cover here these were both
built by a guy whose tag is I am root or
at I am root he had that name before the
guardians of the galaxy movie just so
you know the first one we're going to
cover is the one that looks like a red
iMac this one was built for his son it
has an i3 in it a 750ti an SSD and a 500
gigabyte hard drive what's really cool
about both of these rigs is how they
look very much like old IMAX even
including the fact that their front
loading optical drive base still work
it's not actually the original Mac one
it's an aftermarket optical drive bay
but it still works and it looks
completely authentic which is super cool
he did it in a stack formation so
there's a power supply on the bottom and
then a motherboard above that which is
held up by some ready rod and then
everything just kind of sits there quite
nicely in the back of the iMac in the
front he has LCD panels that he bought
on eBay so these were bare LCD 1080p
panels that are 13.3 inches he then used
a little custom PCB that he also bought
on eBay which was shipped from China
which converts
HDMI to LVDS it's a converter that cost
$35 it takes 12 volt in and then is
wired directly into the PSU for the 12
volt rail and then just yeah you plug in
LCD LVDS on one end
take HDMI o to the other end and you're
good to go in order to hold the screens
in place he created what looks like a
Plexiglas sandwich so he has clear
plexiglass on the front and then colored
Plexiglas on the back behind the panel
which matches the color of the iMac so
the red one has red the purple one has
purple I think this is super cool I love
that he did it this year for his son and
daughter in the past he's done built for
himself in like a brief
case and one of them was in like a super
old radio and one of them was in a
longboard super cool I love guys that do
rigs every year what he does because
that sounds very expensive is he just
reuses the internal hardware and built a
custom case around it very good idea
next up is the minecraft creeper build
made by 8-bit builder or also known as
Thor con thr Kon and check out his
YouTube channel which is youtube.com
slash Thor con this build is sick I'm
going to get to him in a moment but the
hardware it is an i3 4170 as an as Rock
H 97m ITX motherboard as samsung 750
series SSD as far as I can tell and an
SFX power supply the button on the side
is the TNT block which is sick all of
these little individual blocks are
actual small individual blocks not just
carved out of one piece of wood which is
actually pretty fantastic and some of
them are translucent meaning that you
can kind of see some light coming
through them so we have some white and
some green ones that have illumination
all throughout the case I guess we can
call it for now or the creeper also up
through the middle is where a lot of the
airflow comes from so there's fans up
here that pull air down from the bottom
there's a fan that pushes air out the
back there's another big fan that keeps
it going up through the top of the
computer so this thing has no lack of
airflow at all how do you go about
building these you've told me you built
a bunch in the past - I just use a 2000
I'll use a use of one inch cubes about
Birol wooden usually two to three
thousand depending on the case and I
usually actually plan it out I build it
out minecraft actually and then I take a
time-lapse going the whole thing up and
then so I usually make a video of just
building the whole thing from nothing to
everything painting everything so so
like architectural planning is all done
in Minecraft yeah you know a lot of
people are like oh you know you could
get in some you know heavier editing
programs to do stuff that's like you
know it started with Minecraft it gets
the job done I'm not doing anything
crazy it works pretty good you know some
red lines for when I'm running the
electric you know where the budget goes
everything mostly computer parts are all
like almost inches anyway so it's pretty
perfect it works pretty good so what's
your what's your favorite one of these
that you've built man my favorite
actually I think is the airship I built
Final Fantasy airship from Final Fantasy
2 has spinning propellers
that's that's probably that's my
favorite one it's that one's pretty
sweet
that's it can people check out that
build on your YouTube channel yes F that
one's on my youtube channel they're all
on my youtube channel this one's not up
yet but I'll be up very soon if someone
wanted to get into doing something like
this what would you how would you
recommend they start I'm actually for
this one I actually have I made a video
on making a video series I recorded
everything about each step of building
this so I'm actually have a little video
series going on how to actually make one
of these on your own and it's actually
very simply gonna get any you just need
wood glue and cubes and very basic tools
you know power tools really I built I
bought my first one in an efficiency
apartment no problem that's awesome and
how do you go about distributing
lighting all throughout the case for all
the individual like translucent panels
alright so these are all these plastic
cubes I probably have about there's
might about 50 on here I have about a 12
inch cathode tube and each leg one in
the body and the one in the head usually
I'd like to have some kind of lighting
effect because all computer mods have
some kind of lighting going on so for
this one I decided to go with 1-inch
cubes with a some frosted fat to get the
light spread out but there are about two
inch lot there are two inch long cubes
so when the lights are going through the
inside it hits the side of the cube and
it just verses right down through the
side and that's why that's awesome
