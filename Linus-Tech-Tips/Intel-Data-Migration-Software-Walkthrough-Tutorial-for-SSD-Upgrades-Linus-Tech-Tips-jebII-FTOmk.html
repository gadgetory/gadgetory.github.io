meaning to take a look at for a long
time this is the Intel data migration
software
it's powered by a Cronus so well
apparently there's a full version that
you can get why don't we find out what
happens if you try and get the full
version okay upgrade from Intel data
migration software without 40% off
discount so $29.99 so after that you can
have continuous data protection you can
create complete disk images performing
parental and differential backups backup
specific documents folders and
categories and have access to the
archives at back at any time and
anywhere using online backup neat okay
well let's get rid of that now and what
I'm going to do is I'm just going to do
the basic things so there's a few things
that are included in the basic version
so there's a data migration software
media builder so you can create a
bootable media with the Intel components
you select so there's a data migration
software okay
it's drivers for USB PC scuzzy hard
disks as well as the system report thing
ok so we can do this we can run a Cronus
dry cleanser so we can delete all the
data off drives we can add new disks
which one I'm going to do what we are
going to do is we're going to click
start now we are going to use the
automatic parameters and we are going to
take the data from the silicon power
drive that I'm using as my boot drive
right now which clearly isn't large
enough for my test PC because I'm
already totally full I haven't even
installed any games other than Hawks 2
and I'm going to migrate them over to an
Intel 120 gig SATA 3 SSD so I'm going to
select a source disk which is this guy
I'm going to select a target disk which
is this guy yeah that's fine and let's
see how this goes yes I'll be clicking
proceed right about now
ok so the software prompted me to reboot
and here's what it came up with please
focus your best camera ok so it's
copying the partitions it's copying from
that sad 4 space Drive to not this Intel
I've the other IntelliJ IDE the one back
there it's a 5-10 series 120 gig SSD and
yeah so the operations taking a little
while and then hopefully I'll have a new
OS right Hey look there's me so the data
migration software says I am done so
what I'm gonna do now is I'm going to
press any key to shut down the computer
there we go
then I'm going to unplug the SandForce
SSD leaving only my intel SSD plugged
into the system and i'm going to boot it
back up let's see how let's see if we
get into Windows ok here we go
starting Windows excellent there's my
test bench and there we go just like
that that was easy
the catalyst control center plow blah
blah that makes sense because I have an
Nvidia card misses some finished restart
required so I got to restart in order to
install drivers for the SSD that I'm
currently using all right but let's see
here what do we got
ok so yeah the internal system disk
everything is working a hundred percent
with that simple little process so that
my friends is how to use the Intel data
migration tool to take your old boot
drive whether it's an SSD hard drive a
USB drive an SD card whatever the case
may be and migrate the data over to a
new SSD thank you for checking out this
