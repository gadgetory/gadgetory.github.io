million-dollar plaque really subscriber
plaque and then we got our multiple
hundred thousand evolved some things but
I don't think it's really cool but my
actual like favorite lot of life it does
and then the silver ones too like if
that's all solid that's quite a bit of
money and then so welcome to scrapyard
Wars you guys might be wondering what's
up with all the mad stacks will this
scrapyard Wars is gonna be a little bit
different we are going to build a
computer we are gonna build a good value
computer but there is no set budget the
challenge today with our special guest
Austin Evans is to build the best bang
for the buck computer will be using five
different benchmarks Tomb Raider far cry
4 sentiment PC mark and 3d mark fire
strike to determine who has gotten the
most possible value for their money
all right friends care package from
debrand D brand skin ah yes sirs
so we got an s6 edge+ we got a note 5
and we've got yes my friends MacBook
Airs pearl okay so these are the tools
that we'll be using to do all of our
scrapyard Waring thanks to thee brand
let's see I think my MacBook Air is
supposed to be like a special one so
orange yes I believe that one is that
one is it so you guys can flip over the
other two because I am totally going for
this is a new orange finish from them
that looks absolutely sickle that I
gotta say I like the wood grain that
orange is pretty I was mad at my wood
grain if I got wood grain on the laptop
sure I'd always want me okay so out of
all you guys but I got my D brand phone
I got my chest strap done up oh you got
the real stuff right yeah you got the
real stuff right yeah me too bro so
let's go no-holds-barred scrapyard Wars
holds board he's gross
wait I should I need my laptop where
does my laptop go here it is okay really
happy let's go dude uh have you got here
okay alright basically my plan right now
is
oh there we go okay totally thought the
door was locked
all right so the plan right now is to
just get out of here so I think it looks
way more legit if we're like not here so
we're going it's a great question uh-uh
let's not be here let's just drive a
little ways and figure this out so okay
potential problem number one I actually
haven't even done any pre thought I've
been so busy that I haven't had any time
to figure out how I'm gonna tackle this
challenge potential problem number two
there's three of us this time there's
gonna be Craigslist crap that's listed
two weeks ago that they get no calls
about and I'm gonna have three people
calling them today so we it is gonna be
a race against the clock to win
scrapyard wars three which obviously
means it's a great idea that I'm sitting
here on a couch I should I should really
get going
it's gonna try to save some money by
avoiding a case build everything to make
a cardboard box or something it's all
about price to performance so if I spend
like even half the budget I almost feel
like we're gonna go over because I know
I'm thinking like six seven hundred
dollars something like that you know of
a cool spot around here like I know my
hotels over here what's a cool spot like
we could hang out so nowhere oh that is
some wicked gas we're not in the car yet
though so it's okay oh man oh wow that's
like that is some outdoor grade gas one
of my biggest concerns is that I think
we're gonna be fighting for parts I
think we're gonna be fighting for parts
because I don't think there's actually
that many for sale right now I'm
wondering if it has something to do with
the Canadian dollar being in the tank at
the moment
it's my tip so one of our dastardly
plans is to send responses from
Craigslist ad posters to those guys that
they never actually messaged so we'll
try and we'll try and get them off the
trail get them confused so we're all
gonna be on Craigslist we're all gonna
be trying to find the same deals or
maybe not because the way that I see it
there's actually a few different ways to
tackle this we can try and get the
cheapest possible computer that is at
least capable of running the benchmarks
and hope the other guys spend way more
or we can go for like the traditional
bang for the buck PC somewhere in the
seven to eleven hundred dollar range and
win the benchmarks and hope the other
guys aren't able to get great value for
the dollar I frankly don't know what the
answer is right now yeah what if we try
to do like a hundred dollar gaming PC
build I don't know if it's necessarily
going to be awesome but its price to
performance right so if this is as tenth
as good as if they spend $1,000 then we
actually win so this could work it's
only ten dollars and it's even here this
could work maybe okay so I just got a
two hundred and twenty dollar offer on a
box of video cards oh we're calling this
guy we're calling this guy that looks
like an 8600 GT s like if we can just
taking up space on a shelf if we can get
that for like two bucks or five bucks or
something we might be in pretty good
shape
it's an option so I'm calling the guy
with our 9280 430 bucks I'm gonna offer
him our twenty can you do 120 bucks
awesome when do you want me to come pick
it up yeah yeah but Port Moody is like a
city like I need to know where okay so I
got a r9 280 for 120 bucks I really want
to get that 290 but I don't think the
price per performance
is worth it when the 290 would be over
$100 or no basically exactly $100 more I
don't know there's there's some funny
math there because you have to calculate
it in the whole rest of the system as
well but I think it's you eighties gonna
be good and I think I need to move on to
other things
so I'll go with that if I'm learning
anything from this is that people like
to really over price their old PC
hardware like people like trying oh my
my six-year-old gaming PC's worth $800
it was worth $1200 five years ago no
dude it's worth like 300 ollars get over
yourself maybe in the used market in
general is just because that turnover is
so low yeah dude yeah I mean I'm just
seeing tons of junk here and everyone so
I see something cool like okay so this
is a g4 7900 for $50 I mean it's got
s-video on it it's not gonna be worth
$50 I don't care what you say Wow a lot
of this stuff is pretty brutal
is that a 9600 for 10 bucks though
that's not bad let's save that in the
numbers sheet the best thing to do this
is gonna be a disadvantage for Austin in
this whole competition because he hasn't
done this before but the best thing to
do is write in the first couple hours
put out as many feelers as possible yeah
you're right this does take a long time
I also totally want to find like I got
pawn shop not it all right oh that's a
good idea that's a great idea yeah I
like the car just like runs out there's
a queue 9650 cpu I'm still potentially
interested in that if I can get it for
the right price I think we're gonna need
a quad-core to win that Cinebench is
gonna make a big difference
I wonder how Austin's doing at this
point like new city like he doesn't even
know where any of these sub regions are
like he's gonna be like Oh Yaletown
that's probably pretty close okay I
think we might have found something here
a pair of 7950 graphics cards for $150
and that's both of them so basically one
of them actually they were both used for
Bitcoin mining but I don't really care
as long as it works for long enough
where I can actually like benchmark that
could work
$150 where's this 13th Avenue
is that Burnaby what was that anywhere
near Burnaby newest did any idea where
that is scrapyard wars we'll be right
back after these messages
this episode of scrapyard wars is
brought to you by deep brand makers of
the precision cut vinyl skins that
you'll see on the phones and notebooks
of our contestants they offer a wide
variety of styles and colors and support
for the coolest devices including the
PlayStation 4 galaxy note 5 and iPhone
6s protect the body of your devices and
make them look great at be brand.com
slash scrapyard wars trying to work on
the system so what I'm trying to find
now I have a graphics card I'm really
not gonna look for a case power so I'm
probably gonna have to get on its own
and so what I'm looking for right now is
a motherboard processor memory
essentially and a hard drive I guess but
I might try to sneak an SSD in there if
I can I just don't know if it'll be
worth it because most of our benchmarks
are CPU and GPU $60 for an SSD that
could be that could be all right maybe I
think you might be able to get a new SSD
it would probably wouldnt be that it's
find out that much cheaper but we also
maybe try to get that guy down a little
bit so this guy wants 60 bucks for a 120
gig SSD that is so not happening
$60 Ferb price you can buy brand new 240
gigs for $98 so I'll see if I can get
him to be a little bit more realistic
yeah I was just wondering if you were
interested in selling parts of it at all
yeah it's a pretty good point I was only
interested in the motherboard processor
Ram and potentially power supply I call
him up I'm like are you interested in
selling just the parts and he's like oh
yeah totally that was my first idea when
I was gonna be on Craigslist was I was
just gonna part it out and he ends the
phone call like well I'm okay with
selling the parts if you buy all of them
so so far I've got a graphics card that
I'm picking up a hat to read something
that was a r9 280 for a hundred and
twenty bucks I don't know if that's like
necessarily the best deal I could get
but I wanted to move on to system
because I did notice that a lot of my
processors they're kind of scarce right
now I can't find very many of them so I
had a whole graphics card options I'm
just like okay I just want to get that
out of the way I should have maybe done
that later but whatever I'm really
trying to find my platform right now
having a little bit of trouble with it
dude I think this might be it $150 for
279 50s that's gonna kill it all right
this is this is we totally need to go
this way so now let's try to find some
other parts and start calling that's
totally way to go dude that's that's it
that's that those are our cards right
there so for a lot of the components I'm
just gonna be kind of browsing what's
out there and buying whatever but for
the graphics card I think I have to shop
a little bit smarter so I'm gonna be
using on in text bench repository in
order to compare graphics cards across
the generations and then from looking at
it briefly I'm feeling pretty good about
the approach of going with a Tahiti
based card so either a 280 or 280 X or a
79 50 or 70 970 I think that's where
we're gonna get the best bang for our
buck so I'm gonna lowball this to 80 X
and kind of go from there
okay so this is how I write a Craigslist
email how's it going sorry you're
listing for the pair of 79 50s
I plan on building a gaming PC and was
wondering if you've made sure they can
gain I don't plan on mining but want to
make sure both cards are fully working
thanks cuz I've got to be polite I'm in
Canada so fire that off and hopefully we
hear back okay I'm just being like a
little bitch hi I'm contacting you about
the 280 extra sale are you firm on the
price I don't think I can spend that
much
whenever someone contacts you like that
are they open with that well not like a
loser but like getting a better price
makes you a winner yo but uh in a little
bitch hey here's a good deal on an SSD
let's see if this guy has a phone number
40 bucks call all right I'm gonna offer
I'm gonna offer 30 for a 120 gig if I
can get it I'm feeling really good about
my storage drive who uses a home phone
number I can't even text that so I'm
gonna I'm gonna just I'm gonna play
every game in the book
sisty on Craigslist I can come get it
today if you can do $30 do you have
anything else for sale I'm trying to
build a budget gaming PC for a friend of
mine who's moving away maybe next time
it'll be like my six sister or something
she broke her arm and she can't go out
much so we're getting her gaming
computer look you might be judging me
here but I have a competition to win so
yeah I did say no-holds-barred this is
the guy with the lots of older computer
stuff come he says come take a look
should we just should we just go check
it out okay I've come across an
interesting discovery there's a 7950 GX
- that's a dual GPU card the guys asking
25 bucks if I can get that for like $10
or something I could be in a really good
shape no that's a DirectX 9 part okay I
knew I knew when we were choosing the
benchmarks that we should have gone with
something older than far cry 4 but it
looks like you have to run it on DX 10
or dx11 hardware so right now I've
switched from buying that that r9 280 to
an arnai 200 or 290 I haven't told the
280 guy yet because the 290 guys seems a
little bit flaky so I'm think I'm gonna
wait until I get a actual confirm from
him so the next problem we have is just
having to power these 279 50s so I
started looking around there are not a
lot of power supplies we might be able
to find something used but just out of
curiosity I looked on NCIX it's gonna be
like 97 dollars to get like a corsair ZX
750 we might have happen to buy some new
stuff because the options on Craigslist
or not is as solid as I was hoping and
plus there are a lot of people think
that stuff is worth way more than
actually is so we're super stressed on
time right now so much so that we're
having delicious sushi because you know
we got this okay so I found something
decent here so this guy has an older
computer but he's willing to part it out
so you get a cool master case with a DB
right
20 bucks and there's a power supply a
500 watt power supply for 30 bucks that
can work but I don't think that's
something 950 is claiming to power
though what if we get to really keep
power supplies oh and like tape one in
the top or something yeah cool
so like we basically just tell you how
like one 500 watt power spike in the
system like with like tape another one
to the top just to power the other
graphics card I almost want to do that
purely because of how ridiculous it
would be it might not even save us any
money that would be awesome now we're
gonna go try to hit up some local
computer stores maybe try to find like
some used cases we still need like a
motherboard and memory okay so I didn't
realize there's gonna be an apple
specialist I mean we're here we might as
well try yo you have a Mac right okay
so slight change of plans we just left
the MacBook at the restaurant no big
deal but uh that was my bad so let's uh
take it back to the air before uh this
MacBook gets stolen
I can't believe I just walked off bets
neither of us saw that right
next time on scrapyard wars Luke's mom
