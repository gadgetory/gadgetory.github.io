2017 content check out the new rising
processor in the link in the description
down below back at Computex 2016 in win
help this epic competition between
modders from all around the world to see
who could make the best mod of one of
their platforms our friends at BS mods
were there Bob and rod and they had a
really interesting submission I made a
video about it you guys voted and
they're one of the winners to have their
mod turned into an actual production
purchasable case when I walked up to the
booth at in win I seriously thought it
was the modded version from before I was
like oh cool they brought the one that
they made at Computex to the show floor
at CES I was wrong that is the final
product that is a purchasable expensive
Limit Edition product that looks
absolutely legit upon closer inspection
while staying true to the original build
they have done some upgrades the sword
itself does look a little bit better and
on the pommel there's this really
awesome power button that feels really
nice and then along the side of the
blade there's your IO so they have two
USB three two USB 2 and audio headers
all of those scallops are on three
millimeter thick aluminum panels which
is super legit and the shield on the
right side of the case as an LED
backlight behind it the giant rivets all
throughout the case are all real they
actually source rivets that big
specifically for this build which is not
something anyone normally uses at all
for the cross on the front that mesh
pattern that goes behind it they had to
find the original material that they
actually used for the first mod and buy
it in bulk which is actually a
complicated process but either way it
looks great and it probably should
considering it cost so much that if you
actually care how much it costs you
probably shouldn't buy it I'd actually
don't know right off the top of my head
that wasn't really a variable that
mattered but to make sure that you
actually know that it is fully legit
through and through there's a signed
panel on the left hand side from Bob and
rod themselves which is awesome this
build that you can see right now weighs
65 pounds without the water in it so it
actually weights a little bit more than
that and when they display it they take
two people to pick it up all of this was
built on an in win 509 frame so if you
think you can do a mod that's cool as
well
you can pick that up and if you're
thinking of other things maybe try to
give them a name @bs mods on Twitter
they're trying to figure out a name for
this one that I thought of was sword and
board which is kind of like the night
thing but it's not a board for the
shield it's a metal thing so if you can
think of something more creative than I
did and speaking of creativity thanks
again to AMD for sponsoring our CES 2017

introduce a new memory architecture that
