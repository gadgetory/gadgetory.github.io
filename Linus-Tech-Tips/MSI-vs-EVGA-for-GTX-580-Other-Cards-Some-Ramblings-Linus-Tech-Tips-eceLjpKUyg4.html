which brand of video cards should I
choose I want to get a GTX 580 or I want
to get a Radeon 5770 what whatever
whatever card you're looking at and you
want to know which brand to choose so
for the launch of the GTX 580 I happen
to have the luxury of having two cards
to compare so I have one from EVGA so
this is an EVGA reference GTX 580 so you
can see it uses the same cooler as the
MSI GTX 580 it also uses the same PCB
layout as the GTX 580 and I have a lot
of people asking me like should I pick
based on overclocking results in reviews
or should I pick based on you know the
the overall quality of the product well
I can tell you one thing right now these
are both reference design products
especially when you buy a high end GPU
at launch they are quite literally
exactly the same thing there is no
quality difference between an MSI GTX
580 and an EVGA GTX 580 none whatsoever
so put that out of your mind so some of
the ways that you can differentiate is
in terms of the other ways that the
brands differentiating each other from
each other that's awkward anyway so MSI
has a three year warranty and EVGA has a
lifetime warranty if you register so
there's one tick box for EVGA MSI's card
actually comes with a slightly better
accessory package although I do mean
slightly it comes with a long HDMI cable
about a six foot cable versus the EVGA
one comes with one that's about this
long so that's a mini HDMI to HDMI cable
and the MSI one also comes with my
preferred type of six pin to eight pin
so it just has a single six pin on the
one side that goes to a single 8 pin on
the other side whereas EVGA uses one of
those dual 6 pin 2 8 pin adapters that
I'm not all that fond of now in terms of
connectivity overclocking results etc
etc it's all luck of the draw
except remember these two are just
reference products both of these
manufacturers will release all kinds of
different non-reference products so EVGA
for example on the GTX 460 has their
external exhaust version they've got any
number of overclocked skew so that is
they have GTX 460 s that are overclocked
out of the box now you do pay a slight
premium for them but that means that
you're getting a higher speed bin and if
you don't know what a speed bin is go
ahead and check out my NCIX tech tips
episode on the process of binning and
that'll explain what that means but
you're basically getting like a higher a
higher graded chip okay because it
passed at a higher speed you're getting
yeah well basically that's it when you
buy a factory overclocked card that's
what you get and MSI also does some
pretty unique solutions as well so you
can see here I've actually got some MSI
GTX 460 Hawke Edition cards so these
guys have triple over voltage so it
means you can over hold the GPU the RAM
as well as the GPU PLL voltage so you
can get some great overclocks it's
actually got a switch on the back where
is it right there where you can even
change the voltages so that you can go
even higher and get real crazy
aftermarket coolers so uh
oh yeah EVGA like I said they have their
external exhaust coolers versus the
reference one and my size about the Twin
Frozr - they've got the cyclone all
kinds of unique stuff that these
particular vendors are doing now they
also have some software differences
although they aren't really differences
EVGA is got their precision tool which
is for overclocking and tweaking all
that good stuff monitoring your
temperatures fan speeds and MSI has
afterburner which is a fairly similar
utility now bear in mind that both EVGA
and MSI have graciously allowed all
other board partners to use their
particular software so you can actually
buy any card and use MSI Afterburner and
the same goes for EVGA precision which
is pretty cool of both of them to do
that EVGA also has their 24/7 tech
support as well as their where is the
the terms and conditions for that one I
believe they still do offer a trade-in
program if something newer and
after comes out so that you can now you
can trade in your old card about some
little bragging on the side of their box
here which is definitely some
interesting stuff there you go
EVGA is number one and then looking you
have on the msi box not a whole lot
there so it's fine I mean these are
reference cards so it becomes very
difficult to differentiate so like I
said I've brought up a bunch of
different things that both of these
brands do to separate their products
from the other Nvidia partners for these
particular cards is going to come down
to what kind of price how much of a
value you put on the the value adds that
each of these board partners have
attached to their GTX 580 and your
personal preference because really
nobody can tell you what experience
you've had in the past with MSI or what
experience you've had in the past with
EVGA I mean there's all kinds of
different factors like you could go oh I
got an MSI motherboard and it's great so
I want to buy an MSI product great good
for you but that's no reason why you
can't use an EVGA card on an MSI
motherboard and similarly if you have an
AMD chipset there's no reason you can't
use an Nvidia card and the other way
around you got an EVGA board you want to
throw in maasai card in it no problem so
there you go there's my little guide on
EVGA vs MSI as far as being Nvidia and
board partners and go oh yeah I should
have probably mentioned my one of my
personal favorite ways to pick video
cards is based on the aesthetic of it
you know whether you like the EVGA
sticker or you like the the msi sticker
better can actually make a difference to
people and you can even run into
differences a little bit later when
we're not all using reference cards
we're you know some will have a green
PCB some will have a black PCB so so
yeah and yeah like I said it's a goofy
thing but that is actually something
that factors in for me personally</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
