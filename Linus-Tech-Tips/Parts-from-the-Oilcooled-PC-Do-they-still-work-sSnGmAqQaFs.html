warehouse looking for something right
yeah it was mounting brackets for these
didn't find them not the point point is
I found this a Rubbermaid bin in gray
that's not what's important what's
important is what's inside this is the
original motherboard and graphics card
from the mineral oil cooled PC out of
there oil and oh my gosh absolutely this
casting let's find out if they still
work after I tell you about eks phoenix
lineup of modular water cooling systems
it's their next-generation modular AIO
and you can check them out now at the
link in the video description
so the dealio here is that we actually
refurbished this machine around the time
of LTX last year with the intention of
showing it off there so we pulled off
some of the stickers that were kind of
peeling off replace the motherboard
replace the graphics card with something
more modern so it's got a 1070 in there
now and then never actually successfully
repaired the tank we think it might be
working now but the previous attempts
we've made have just resulted in it
cracking again almost immediately and to
replace this they thought this attempt
Flyknit that's disgusting to replace
this thing would have cost like a
thousand dollars from a customer critic
shop so that stuff's all gonna stay
there because ideally I really would
like to fix it at some point but in the
meantime I totally forgot about the
motherboard and graphics card I want to
know if they still work so let's grab
some test bench hardware here hmm our
options are 59 60 XR 59 30 K I guess
that's the least valuable thing that we
might wreck so let's grab that okay so
my options are use my crap here test
bench but then I have to put a power
supply in it or use my better one but
then I'm gonna get mineral oil on it I'm
just lazy so I guess we're using this
one stuff is just nasty and it like
spreads everywhere it's basically like
glitter except it doesn't even look
sparkly and fun so there are a couple of
things to contend with when it comes to
mineral oil now the main thing is the
like mineral oil all over the place but
the big problem is that mineral oil has
a nasty habit of degrading plastics and
rubbers and really a lot of things that
it comes in contact with so one of the
things that's going to be a challenge
here as you can see this memory slot
just snapped off when we went to open it
up and at least one of the pins is
actually bent inside the slot there so
what we're gonna try and do is lift that
back up and see if we can get a stick
working in there
you know it's actually not in terrible
shape all things considered I mean it's
like furry because it's been sitting out
in the warehouse during the renovation
and it's been covered in mineral oil the
theory the theory if you talk to the
mineral oil enthusiasts they'll be like
oh yeah you just leave it out drip dry
for a few weeks no problem you want to
touch it so let's just let's isolate our
variables here let's try just the
motherboard first then we'll try it with
the graphics card that was soaked in oil
oh I am excited right about now I mean
if this thing works I don't like Max's
PC is that what you were gonna say no
you don't want the mineral oil cooled
okay so the reason we want to try just
the motherboard without this card first
is because we've got to potentially like
Jane cast components here so if it
doesn't work we want to know that it's
down to one of them so we want to make
sure the motherboard works first so we
can troubleshoot anything there then
we'll try the graphics card because if
we just put the graphics card and the
motherboard on and it didn't boot up we
wouldn't know what the actual issue was
look I even went and got paper towel and
why am I still waking this in my pants
you know what screw it let's get this
show on the road people paid good money
to be here ow watch this video damn that
hurt okay hey we got postcodes like
that's a good sign check this out
thirty-two four F seven nine look at
this it's got like a big long hair a
hundred groans hey look at that no
problem let's see how much ram we've got
detected here twelve cakes shoot that
doesn't seem like an insurmountable
problem okay oh wow this memory is like
it's wet contrary to what people might
think I don't actually want to go out of
my way to destroy a hardware
just kind of happens you know so one of
them is just not making contact at all
right now
then there's another four here that are
all just exposed they're no longer
supported okay I'm not gonna put in that
last stick this time but if we see 12
gigs this time odd sleeping all over the
card not an esd-safe cleaning method but
it's better than having mineral oil all
over it throw the last stick in I want
to see 16 gigs because it could still
actually be something in the CPU socket
that was damaged and then that would be
another reason why we would have one of
the dims not showing up in fact it might
have been not that stick all this time I
actually don't know got it
mangled RAM slot repaired no idea how
stable it'll be but that's the problem
for another day damn I'm good sometimes
some people get excited by know like
know naked people this gets me excited
look at this here we are on the desktop
let's just run a quick stress test I
guess
Hoopa do okay so we didn't run the full
15 minutes or anything like that what
are we sitting at eight minutes but at
this point it did not immediately crack
let's go ahead and shut this down then
and find out if the graphics card works
so looking at this you can see actually
there's not a lot of external damage to
it so these stickers all faded you can
see the text will just wipe off so not
bad so whether they intended to or not
EVGA made a pretty much mineral oil
proof graphics card so if I'm turned on
by Hardware seeing it suffer like this
is that like a weird thing if you're not
comfortable having the door closed right
now we can open it just
this is Alex's drive not mine
okay so the driver install was a little
bit weird see if we can run us some 4k
rise of the Tomb Raider BAM I don't even
know if this card is capable at 780 this
is even pre 780ti we did this build a
long time ago wow I'm getting old I mean
one thing I was concerned about was
whether it would still stay adequately
cool I mean it has the benefit of having
one of the best graphics card coolers
available I mean how many heat pipes
does this thing have I don't think
anyone has a lot invested whether I've
got this right or not what you guys hear
that you guys hear that short so that's
not posting something I had forgotten
about is this motherboard actually got
three caps soldered back on to it once
it came out of the oil they were just
like loose so it's possible that there's
been damage to the graphics card well oh
it's dead damn you know I thought I
thought we had a miraculous success
story for you guys today
