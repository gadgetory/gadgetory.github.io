outdoor unboxing of the ISIS and for a
890 D probe now I already did unboxings
of the GTD pro as well as the GTD pro
USB 3 so this is without the G which
actually makes it better
contrary to what you might think so this
is using AMD's 890 FX chipset that means
you've got full support for AMD's venom
2 X 6 processors as well as any other
Fenimore Athlon on the am-3 platform
that you could possibly want to put in
it it has turbo unlocker which means
that you can adjust your performance on
demand basically it means that you can
unlock the turbo feature on the AMD 6
course and you also have koron Locker
which means you can unlock cores that
are not there on the triple cores and
the dual cores so let me see what else
we've got
oh yeah because it has an 890 FX chipset
you've got native support for SATA 6
gigabits per second that means all of
the ports are SATA 6 king per second you
also have power eSATA support which is
really cool if you have an external
drive like the Seagate go flex that I
that I unboxed recently that actually
has a powered eSATA option so that's
pretty cool as well we've got an i/o
shield
we have Wow not many accessories for an
890 FX board we've got an IDE cable then
we have the Q connector for a USB as
well as the front panel connectors power
switch reset switch all that good stuff
then we have four state of three
connectors or SATA 6 gigabits per second
connectors there's no actual difference
but they have a little label on them
that says say 2 6 gigabit per second I
don't know if you're gonna be able to
read that and they look cooler because
they're black and white versus the old
red ones that assumes provides 4 SATA 2
here is the support DVD do not use it
throw it away
download the latest off the assist
website and then we've also got the
turbo unlocker description so a
performance boost feature and it
dynamically adjusts each CPU core for
you ok so yeah basically like turbo mode
ok good manual manual is in English and
it is long let's have a look at the
board itself as Zeus has done such a
good job with the emphasis with the
aesthetics of their most recent boards I
really really like what they've done
they've gone
like kind of a I mean it wasn't that
long ago a Seuss was producing other
boards the color of cardboard and now
almost everything's got a nice black PCB
it's got a nice black and blue color
scheme without you know any sort of
random like you know one orange port or
anything like that we used to see that a
lot where there's just like everything
is sort of one color except you know
this dim slot is yellow because yellow
plastic was cheaper that day or whatever
it's really nice really sharp up here
we've got our eight pin power connector
so this is you know I get a lot of
questions about this the fact that one
side is covered means that if you only
have a four pin power connector on your
power supply you plug it into these ones
if you have an eight pin power connector
you take off this cover and plug it into
the whole thing so you can see there's
eight pins under there so that is why
that covers on there just so that you
don't accidentally try and plug a four
pin into this side okay then we have our
m3 CPU socket that's where you get
support for all of the chips that I
outlined before you have support for
dual channel ddr3 memory and it uses a
Seuss's innovative only one side
installation system so these are not
actual clips you just kind of slip the
module in there clip it down and then
clamp it on the other side here are the
switches for turbo key 2 as well as
their core unlocker so this core on
Locker switch I think I did a video on
it yeah I did do a video on it with the
G Series board is as simple as you hit
the switch and it unlocks the cores it's
really cool mem okay means that you can
post with pretty much any memory as long
as it fits in the slots and then okay
will run any module at a very very safe
setting so that you can get into the
BIOS and adjust it to what it's supposed
to run at here is the Southbridge here
is your IDE port and here are your SATA
6 gigabits per second ports all lined up
down here now these aren't the ideal
locations for your SATA ports I'd prefer
to see them at a right angle like the
IDE port here but what they have done is
they've really kept it out of the way of
your graphics card so even if you have a
dual slot graphics card installed here
and a dual slot one installed here it's
only going to come up to about here so
as long as you don't have like a PCI
raid card or something this long then
you're not going to run into any trouble
plugging in as many devices as you want
here's your BIOS chip here's your front
USB 2.0 this board does not
yes it does feature USB 3.0 and its term
in terms of expansion slots you've got
dual PCIe 16x support you've got one
PCIe 4x slot that will still be exposed
even if you're running crossfire and
then you have two PCI slots one of which
will be usable if you are running
crossfire with dual slots
here's your North Bridge it's actually
connected by a heat pipe to the MOSFET
cooler so I don't know if you can see
that in there and this uses what someone
suggested to me is more like a tree than
anything else that uses their tree style
of heatsink that I really like it's just
kind of cool-looking let's look at that
from a couple different angles camera
man always appreciates this kind of
stuff where it's like you know more
about aesthetics than actual performance
and I'm starting to get that way myself
to be perfectly honest let me see if
there's anything else that I should
really tell you about on this board
while the camera man oh yeah a hybrid
technology I think it's something to do
with power savings actually ok well
let's have a look at the back of the
board we've got two ps2 ports a clear
CMOS button thank you a soos that is the
best possible place for a clear CMOS
button two USB 3.0 ports you can tell
because they're color-coded blue and
they also have more pins inside we have
one optical audio out six USB 2.0 ports
firewire a powered eSATA port Gigabit
Ethernet as well as 7.1 channel audio
thank you for checking out my unboxing
of the m4 a8 9td pro 890 FX motherboard
