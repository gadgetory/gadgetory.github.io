text under a top rating system over the
last little while some of it was focused
on the safe redundant storage features
of it like this one about repurposing
older computer hardware to build a more
robust Ness while some of it was more
focused on the virtualization features
of unread that allow multiple virtual
computers we've demoed as many as seven
discrete gaming rigs at a time to live
on top of that safe redundant storage
but while we've discussed how cool that
is and demonstrated really strong
performance with these VMs or virtual
machines we haven't quantified
apples-to-apples how they compare with
running the operating system software
directly on the hardware or the bare
metal so let's do that today then shall
we
the gtx 980ti VR edition from EVGA
provides an industry-leading graphics
experience as well as a five and a
quarter inch bay with easy access inputs
for your VR device learn more at the
link in the video description so I think
we should open with a primer on what
this word virtualization really means
those of you who are intimately familiar
with it can skip ahead because Tarun
gave me a hard time after we filmed the
pro Drupal your networking speed video
about not really explaining what I was
talking about now it's kind of like well
it's kind of like SLI for networking and
he's like well why didn't you just say
that in the video so let's start with an
analogy this is a gigabit network
interface card or NIC it's physical
because I can hold it in my hand and
it's a network interface card because it
connects whatever it's plugged into into
a network and allows those two things to
communicate or interface with each other
at a speed of one gigabit or about a
hundred and ten megabytes per second
pretty straightforward a virtual NIC is
inherently more abstract while it does
still require some hardware I mean
without a physical cable plugged into
something it can't connect to a device
outside of the machine on which it
resides and in most cases it presents
itself to the operating system as though
it is a piece of hardware it's actually
just some clever software pretending to
be hardware which gives it some cool
functionality not the least of which is
that it is able to share its resources
so back to our physical NIC again it's
got that gigabit connection speed I
talked about before well by creating two
virtual NICs we can actually share that
speed between virtual devices like I did
in the gaming nas video where we had
both a file server and the gaming
machine using the same network
connection so this is a very flexible
solution because it means that either of
these devices can use anywhere from 0
all the way to 100% of the available
resources sharing them dynamically and
thanks to some really cool tech from
Intel and AMD this can even be done on
things like CPUs meaning that you can
create entire virtual computers full of
virtual devices that share physical
resources with each other for better
overall efficiency Poole Linus but what
was up with that big asterisk a minute
ago well the KDM kernel-based virtual
machine project at Red Hat which is what
on rate is using to power its
virtualization is some pretty freakin
impressive software but virtual devices
do not have 100% of the performance of
the physical devices because while the
days of emulation that's a very slow way
of doing this virtual device stuff are
basically over there is still some
overhead involved which thank you for
your patience by the way brings us
finally to the topic for today how much
of our raw or bare metal performance are
we giving up when we do a project like
gaming nas or seven gamers one CPU so
for this test I actually ended up using
my personal rig because I had to work on
it at home and I left my test bench at
the office but the good news is that
with it's 59 60 X rampage 5 extreme x99
motherboard gtx 980ti and 64 gigs of
Dominator memory my rig is pretty much
the same as my usual test bench so I
started then by establishing my baseline
performance I ran my test suite with all
eight cores active then I used the BIOS
to turn off one of the physical cores on
the CPU making it effectively a seven
core this was done because for the best
performance on on raid anyway in games
it's best to leave a core aside for
unread to use and give everything else
to your virtual machine and while gaming
actually didn't end up being affected
negatively at all I mean these results
are within my margin of error for these
tests this was expected since games are
not very CPU bound these days and the
video card itself is actually passed
through as
a physical device to the virtual machine
Cinebench also showed the same results
our virtual 7 core and our bare metal 7
core performed the same leaving the only
tests that showed a dramatic difference
being the synthetic memory and cache
tests in AI 264 so depending on the
workload it is possible that these extra
nanoseconds of additional latency could
be a problem but from looking at
performance in consumer oriented
workloads it seems like we are pretty
darn close to a VM being a solid
alternative to running straight on the
hardware now then it's just got to get a
little bit easier for everyday people to
do because while some of the benefits
virtualizing servers to consolidate
functionality are more applicable to the
data center there is some really cool
stuff that I can envision for a consumer
facing product like on raid as well with
the gaming as we did a little while back
being just the tip of the iceburg tunnel
bear is the easy to use VPN app for
mobile and desktop it lets you tunnel so
to speak into up to 20 different
countries allowing you to browse the
internet and use online services as
though you are in a different country so
you know let's say for example you want
to access a website that is blocked in
your country or you want to access a
service that is just plain not available
in your country due to licensing or
whatever else ha
screw that because they've got apps for
iOS Android PC and Mac and they also
have a Chrome extension they're super
easy to use just pick a country press
the friendly-looking button and boom
your connection gets encrypted which by
the way tunnel bear doesn't actually log
in any of your activity which is very
cool and your public IP address gets
switched so you show up as though you're
in a different country and the best part
of tunnel bear is that your first 500
megabytes is absolutely free and after
that the unlimited plans are very
reasonably priced so check it out at the
link in the video description and by the
way you can save 10% by using that
that's tunnel bear comm /l TT so thanks
for watching guys if you dislike this

instructions up there by buying a cool
shirt like this one or by joining our
community forum you can answer people's
questions you can get your questions
about tech Anthony you can just hang out
and chat now that you're done doing
probably all of that stuff or at least
some of it you're probably wondering
what to watch next so click that little
button in the top right corner to check
out this video where I am doing
something really cool or Luke is I'm not
sure I don't know which video we're
teasing</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
