I believe we're live welcome to the wind
show you got a nice streaming on the
right one yes I hope so so I know I know
we are about as late as we've ever been
and I did promise that the new streaming
equipment video capture equipment would
help significantly with that but there
is also a reason why we haven't done our
official like the LAN show set was
updated video yet and that is because we
haven't really done anything about our
audio situation yet we definitely need
some kind of piece of dedicated mixer
hardware that will definitely happen at
some point but basically in a nutshell I
was super loud
Luke was super quiet he's skyping in
from twitch con right now the little
like volume thing in the corner you know
the bling-bling thing was crazy quiet
the playing back videos that we recorded
from last week were crazy loud and then
playing back videos we were test
recording just now was like normal and
then apparently it's all normal and we
spend a bunch of time diagnosing
something that wasn't a problem other
than that our system audio is infected
by gremlins on the streaming computer
which shouldn't surprise anybody
are you surprised Luke this is so funny
I look towards my webcam in your picture
but actually I should be looking over
here hi Luke thank you oh oh yes I was
working on my playstation for my like my
playstation for water cool project
that's hardly my project at this point
because Jake did most of the work but
basically my intro involves our rant
about the PlayStation 4 Pro and how like
if I had to upgrade my playstation 4 and
spend $400 every three years to get
better graphics
well that's starting to sound an awful
lot like being a PC gamer isn't it
anyway the rant involves Doritos and
mountain
in this hat and anger so it should be
pretty good she'll be pretty good also I
saw some with the twitch chat saying -
you should be spending time with your
baby instead of and I would love to
accept that my baby is still safely
tucked away in Mama's uterus so there
will be no spending time with that
particular baby other than like kind of
kind of poking it through her stomach
which doesn't really doesn't really
appeal to her nor does it really appeal
to me I got to confess I am not that
into the whole unborn babies thing like
you know people the whole unborn or born
babies thing yeah one step further I
mean the thing that was like people are
like all it's magic it's it's it's it's
just as magical as an iPhone and I'm
just kind of like you know what it I
cannot get the scene from alien out of
my head you know yeah okay oh sorry I'll
go back to the iPhone comparison sure
but like some people get all like oh
it's the magic of like they want to put
their hands on and like oh the baby's
kicking and the other night I was like
mostly asleep and I had my arm over my
wife because we're adults and we're
allowed to do that and the baby kicked
so hard through her stomach that I
jolted awake flipped on him like that
and I woke her up I am NOT a fan not a
fan of baby in the tongue mmm yeah so so
when when baby's out we'll talk and the
baby will not respond because they don't
speak English yet when they are born and
are therefore not a lot of fun not that
I'm saying people you have to speak
English to be fun I'm just saying you
don't communicate at all is super
helpful it's like you could just say I'm
hungry instead of oh my god I got so
limited sleep last night that because of
one of those situations
way too many details but for way too
much time yeah it's reinforcing why I
don't want one fair enough man all right
we should roll the intro speaking
outside things that I do want an intro
yeah I do want an intro let's do that
alright ladies and gentlemen so why
don't we get things started with our
first big topic of the day the galaxy
note 7 this was originally posted by
daring on the forum the original article
here is from Tech time tech time tech
times the tech times all right - the
screen share oh look at that he's still
there
ah that's right that's what I spent 45
minutes setting up today at least that's
nice that's my story and I'm sticking to
it
so Galaxy Note 7 replacements they might
not explode but they might overheat and
drain the battery wild charging Samsung
just cannot catch a break here can they
I would assume because the losing charge
while it's charging thinking about it
was losing 1% of power every second
first of all that seems a little insane
second of all he's probably not using a
first-party charger not that that even
like matter should matter but he could
be using like a point 5 amp charger
right something that's not made for
charging notes still losing 1% of power
every second while it's charging thing
that's still like something's wrong
although this was one user who was
reporting this that's I think he might
be exaggerating a little bit because
that's 100 set to dead in under two
minutes
so Samsung said this problem is
completely unrelated to batteries they
haven't stated if the problem is present
in units replaced in other countries
aside from South Korea so so far
everyone who's encountered the issue has
been in South Korea and the good news is
there are no reports of devices Catching
Fire at least yes so that is a small
victory that's very small in
consequential victory on in other news
it really doesn't get much better for
Samsung here are you posting links in
the chat by the way I might do that
ok so the next one here is from Hardware
dot slash dot dot org or money about CNN
now I'll go with slash dot Wow slash dot
that's like a blast from the past I
remember
slash dot from like ten years ago
apparently it still exists so there's
that ha Samsung may have a new problem
on their hands after the u.s. warns
Samsung washing machine owners after
explosion reports there's a picture that
goes along with it if you want to show
that oh yeah where is that post that
picture in the chat all right let me see
if I can figure out that picture in the
meantime here yes there we go so the the
scariest part of this one is this could
affect units all the way from 2011 to
2016 so here's a picture of you know
what appears to be a bowed out washing
machine it's unclear right now I mean
this is not the world's most gorgeous
wall in the first place but it's unclear
to me if this hole in it is a result of
the washing machine explosion documented
by a Texas woman who claims it exploded
during use she's part of a class action
lawsuit against the company currently
Wow Samsung currently has declined to
comment on the litigation at all which
is not super surprising to be completely
honest without this type of a claim they
would want to do investigations before
trying to claim anything so I'm not too
surprised but they have issued a
statement that said they're talking to
US authorities about how to address
safety problems said in the statement
that in rare cases affected units may
experience abnormal vibrations that
could pose a risk of personal injury or
property damage when washing bedding
bulky or water-resistant items Wawa
you know the like Fight Club thing like
Fight Club thing I have no idea what
you're talking about but I'm pretty sure
you're not supposed to be talking about
it investigating car accidents and
seeing if there's been enough of a
certain type per car for it to be worth
doing like a recall or whatever yeah I
wonder if like there's gonna be like
fight
Club to and like pretty early on in the
intro it shows him and he's like I
investigate phone explosions and washing
machine explosions to see if it's worth
doing a recall Oh someone's gotta
someone's got a parody at least employer
awesome at some point it's bound to
happen I mean all Samsung needs is one
more to reach that Magic three number
because one's a fluke two is sketchy and
three is a trend so I mean the problem
is that Samsung makes pretty much
everything so all we need is for like a
printer to explode like anything oh
that's right yeah they make like
everything there if I remember correctly
there's like Samsung toilets and like
Samsung whatever the heck you want we
almost put a Samsung air-conditioner on
the roof of the building actually Oh our
air conditioning for the server room
just went in so there you go so that's a
thing well it'll be just as loud until
such time as I do something about the
the air vents that are in the door for
the old ambient air cooling system but
at that at that time yes it could
potentially be less loud oh you're
sketchy there's a UK advertising agency
named ass wow that is investigating
hello games which is the no man's sky
guys over false advertising mainly
things like having screenshots and I
believe videos yeah screenshots and
videos that depict large-scale combat
and ship flying behaviors that didn't
actually make it into the game and I
think they could go a little bit farther
than that those are probably just there
like cemented this is very easy to
target kind of stuff because there was
also a large amount of other claims that
didn't end up being true at all so yeah
I kind of have a feeling that Halo games
is going to lose this and I also have a
feeling that the entire Internet will be
okay with that this could have a huge
impact on the way that games marketing
is done in the future I mean
it is not unusual touch docks it is not
unusual to end up with a situation where
a game developer shows off a trailer or
you know some kind of a concepts person
and the finished game though I can't
really judge star citizen as they
haven't finished the game yet and the
finished game ends up not having those
features or those or those levels or
whatever the case may be and in work
right and while this one you know looks
pretty open-and-shut because it's fairly
egregious that this you know large-scale
combat and that the screenshots and
videos on the page depict is not in the
game I think it would be harder to go
after a situation like watchdogs where
it is a graphical difference because
while you and I and probably everyone of
the audience can very easily see the
difference between the e3 demonstrations
and what we actually we're delivered in
the end I think it's going to be harder
to argue in court because I would assume
that the judge and jury wouldn't fully
understand what's actually going on
whereas if you go look there were big
ships and they would go pew pew and now
there isn't big ships that go pew pew I
think that's a more straightforward case
I mean some of the some of the
complaints about no man's sky are also
regarding misrepresentation of the
graphical quality in the game right
which is great but I think the main ones
are the functionality things and
hopefully they'll also hit them with so
the complaints targets team but the
aasa' said that the ruling would apply
to any other advertising for the game so
that could be youtube videos and/or the
games listing on the PlayStation Store
this this could be very interesting I
mean as it is game developers keep
things pretty under wraps while a titles
in development but this could drive them
to be even more careful I mean could
this potentially apply to something like
a demo shown
packs like if I plane if I played wolf
among us okay is a game that it's one of
the few games that I've ever demoed at
PAX just because usually the lineup at
places like pax is such that I'm just
kind of like you know what I can either
wait six months for the game to come out
or I can wait six months in this lineup
and at the end of one of those six-month
periods I will get a demo and at the end
of the other one I will get the entire
game so I think they'll have a better
time getting away with that because that
could be I think you could pretty easily
put a sign somewhere on your booth and
say like game is subject to change or
some crap like that but when it's on
your store page yeah okay well gotta
like oh go ahead is that the the
screenshots and the videos of the stuff
that they are trying to directly sell
right then mmm
I was that apply to like early access
stuff I don't know and and another
complicated thing here too is like so
you're going back to the to the PAX game
demos let's say for example that the
difference okay because we've seen this
before in movies right where the trailer
will actually contain a scene that ended
up getting cut right yeah that's a thing
but there's a difference between us
hahaha a cutscene there's a difference
between a cutscene and completely
pulling core functionality out of the
game so if you're gonna go okay yeah our
game is gratuitous space battles and
your trailer has the like a cutscene and
then it has like a heat to like legions
of ships blasting each other and you
know some some cinematic is gone from
the completed game versus like you can
only fly to on to that those are very
different things so in something like a
pax demo if they were to say okay yeah
our game is like a top-down you know
platformer and then someone sees that
that is marketing so if someone sees
that tries that game and it turns out to
be erasing like a mobile racing game or
something like that
then I guess it becomes a gray area and
a question of just how misleading it was
what happens to if that communication
comes through game journalists like say
say someone goes to a show and it's not
an interview and they play the game they
described their experience and
everything that they described in their
experience that could be seen as a form
of marketing and then if that's not
actually how it ends up going hard to
say because unless they pay the games
journalists and the games journalists
opinions are their own then that's not
officially marked right okay yeah but
what mm-hmm it's still kind of an
interesting area because if you're going
like this game has battles in it that
have 400 ships versus 400 ships yep that
stated as a fact yep
that's not like this game has battles
with a lot of ships and then the game
journalists version of a lot is for I
don't know that's the truth I mean it's
manifest I really want to see how this
plays out another thing I want to see
how it plays out is twitch news twitch
announces twitch prime I think you've
already seen how this played out
actually there is an insane amount of
subs randomly on the line a second
channel oh and like this whole stream up
and watching twitch chat and everyone
tomorrow you'll see you like has just
subscribed with twitch prime so what
twitch prime is to kind of help you blow
it a little bit is Amazon Prime now has
a component under it called twitch Prime
that doesn't cost any amount more money
you get it when you have Amazon Prime it
gives you one subscribe per month to a
channel I believe you can like move it
around but you only have one so you'd be
able to switch it once a month I believe
you get some extra prizes I think they
said swag in hearthstone and smite
although I'm not sure what that's why it
exactly is I think they were talking
about getting certain games on launch
and then discounts on physical copies of
games from Amazon
now I checked that out and literally
every single game that I was able to
find that was discounted because of
being a prime member was discounted by
three to ten cents well all right rock
on
hopefully that I love it I could no no
no no did it look I could get it shipped
for free yeah there you go
you also get a badge which is like a
little blue crown you can see a bunch of
people in the chat right now I have
little blue crowns
I guess the YouTube bot won't be able to
see that but I just described it so oh
hold on hold on I got this I got this I
got this I got this Linus the screen
there blue Crown's blue crowns okay
they're gigantic blue crowns enjoy I've
like the official list of works just
make sure I didn't miss anything but I
think that's basically it it's it's
gonna be interesting because this is
part of the Amazon takeover right yeah
so if you're giving everyone that
already had a prime account a free
subscribe which is giving partners more
money we've already seen with this
channel like last week there was almost
no subscribers this week there is a
large number of subscribers I just
there's literally two people just did it
in chat right now I don't know how to
check sorry
you're like partner panel and stuff so
if you go to your I think it's your
dashboard and then you go to partnership
I'm the world's worst twitch streamer I
legitimately have no idea how the site
works let's see if I can figure it out
it's like okay no no go ahead go ahead
keep explaining how we have more twitch
subscribers and how that's good anyways
it's exploded for us and I'm sure while
the change in growth might not be as big
for other people because our we might
have more people watching here that
don't normally watch twitch because
we're not average content that is on
twitch and this is like we're way above
average
and we basically just got subscriptions
as well so people didn't necessarily
know that you could even subscribe to us
so we're in like kind of a special spot
but everyone's going to see growth and a
lot of the growth could even be like
some dudes girlfriend has an Amazon
Prime account and he's like hey mind if
I link my twitch so I can get a free sub
or dude's mom or girl's mom links for
Amazon account to the kids twitch so
they can get a free sub I'm still
confused as to how the whole Amazon
Prime thing is not just an enormous cash
sink as far as I can tell it is like I
okay okay so let's let's let's like
break it down right from you know top to
bottom Amazon will pay me to tell you
about Prime if you sign up yeah then
they will give you free shipping on
everything which as far as I can tell if
you buy like because okay cuz the
benefit of Prime initially was supposed
to be that it encouraged repeat shopping
right because you wouldn't have to think
about shipping costs whenever shopping
on Amazon okay so if you buy like one
thing a month there goes the entire
Prime membership for the month probably
unless it's something very small okay so
there's that plus there's video
streaming so Amazon Prime costs more
than a Netflix account unless your
Netflix is 4k I think that I think
they're pretty similar I can't remember
how much prime cost to be perfectly
honest with you
but anyway so they have Amazon Prime
video so there's all the licensing costs
associated with something like a Netflix
service maybe not all of them actually
had don't I have to prime accounts I
have one Canada on one u.s. I have never
looked at Amazon Prime video maybe I
should do that anyway so there's a
licensing cost associated with that
there's the cloud storage they give you
you can store an unlimited number of
photos using Prime so so far what does
what does Prime cost again $79.99 for
the year Canadian is $79 flat sorry and
that's a 13 month membership okay so
it's probably about fifty nine bucks
American
okay so it's 11 bucks a month apparently
on amazon.com okay
okay 11 bucks a month so out of 11
dollars a month so far we had spent all
of it times lots and then at the end of
all that they're going okay you can
subscribe to a twitch channel for free
which is 5 bucks and we will give some
of that money to the twitch channel
sorry so once again Oh Luke had a bad
burrito bad burrito he's run into the
bathroom folks oh that's the Bell
miss someone's already in there oh no he
there's been a negotiation there's been
a negotiation he has been negotiated
back back to his chair she's gonna go to
the bathroom on his chair good could you
hear me the whole time okay well that's
awkward he's taking a drink but don't
know I am at twitchcon what I was doing
here has changed a fair amount but so
I'm streaming from a hotel room and that
was someone else's room service who
ended up in my room yeah so the plan
actually this is great because it ty
brings us right into our sponsor spots
for the day the plan was for Luke to be
streaming from the Razr booth yeah check
out the Razr broadcasting suite below
and the talking points for razor there's
actually a bunch of stuff that they're
showing off that's well that they were
going to be showing off in their booth
at twitchcon when they arranged to
sponsor us to be down there covering
twitchcon and streaming from their booth
so the Stargazer the tiny webcam that
clips on to your laptop or monitor and
does everything a green screen setup
does for background removal and more so
it actually features and tells realsense
technology so that's the the depth
sensing whole camera thing so it can cut
out things that are far away as opposed
to things that are a different color
which is pretty darn cool as well as the
siren Pro the mic that any streamer
should look at first XLR input helps
aspiring streamers take their audio to a
professional level
using memory I am actually using the
siren Pro right now the thing that I
like about the siren Pro actually is not
necessarily that see I'm not using the
XLR though I probably will at some point
probably should at some point the thing
I like about it is it's one of the few
mics I found that just kind of works out
of the box like you just set the thing
and then it doesn't peak which is nice
that's really all I ask for that's all
I'm asking for it doesn't seem that
complicated
but we've tried like six different mics
on the line show yeah and then they're
also featuring the ripsaw the world's
first USB 3 capture card I actually
don't know that it is the world's first
USB 3 capture card okay why you said
that is the exact same thing because of
the thing that I'm using right now and
it's we're wrong Oh are we Saul came out
first by like a few months oh it's close
how about that then yeah okay no delay
when recording and it comes out with
just about every cable you need for PC
and console streaming out of the box so
shows you what I know and you can check
these products out at the link in the
video description which will be there
when you are watching this on youtube
or another possibility and I'm gonna go
ahead and paste all these links into
twitch chat for you guys or another
possibility for those links would be to
see them on the twitch vaad and twitch
now has the capability this is the last
part and sort of big part of the whole
upgrade announcement thing that they've
been doing twitch now has the capability
for you to just upload vods straight up
so you don't actually have to stream to
twitch in order to have your video
appear on twitch and this is a weird
reversal for them isn't it first they
don't want you to leave your twitch vods
on twitch now they want you to just
upload videos to twitch yeah they
totally change although that probably
came with like Amazon just being like
servers yes that's what Amazon that's
what Jeff Bezos sounds like we're gonna
have him on the show he's gonna sound
just like that we're me like hi Jeff
welcome to the choice you'd be like
Amazon we have servers wow that's great
Jeff thanks for thanks for
um two things the fire phone wasn't very
good but it wasn't my fault to me is one
I think the amount of people spamming
pre-recorded question mark is gonna be
way too insane on our stream I know I
like main problem with my screams should
just stand the words like consistency
because I go on like work trips and
stuff yeah I could legitimately
pre-record them and then just have them
play wah wah the interesting thing is if
they're just gonna show up in your past
broadcasts when you upload a vaad or if
it will like if you could like schedule
one to play on your channel through
twitch I don't know how any of this
works yet because just shows up in your
past broadcasts I don't think it's gonna
be super successful is that unless they
change like how people look at things on
twitch because right now going to
someone's past broadcasts is very manual
yeah
and it's tedious and they're usually not
titled correctly because Twitter
dreamers are irresponsible and yeah it's
just horrible so if they can have it so
that like you upload it it goes into
your past past broadcast and then
there's like a Settings thing somewhere
we can be like play this file at this
time and that could be kind of
interesting for people that legitimately
just replay stuff like there's certain
gaming tournament channels that will
replay their tournaments while various
tournaments aren't live so you can go
watch them at different timeframes and
yes it is pre-recorded but it's kind of
like going and watching TV yeah it's
kind of like watching or like a match
replay like you would on nope sorry yes
I just and would make it so that those
guys don't have to have computers that
are to set up constantly just playing
like video files and streaming video
files all day so that could be kind of
cool but I have no idea if it's gonna
work that way I'm sorry oh go ahead so I
have no idea if it's gonna work that way
hope it does I'm sorry for contributing
nothing to that last exchange and just
repeating what you said
I felt bad I've got some serious
conspiracy theory nonsense going on here
we've got people saying that you are
pre-recorded and that I am NOT and that
I am actually live and that we were just
extremely impressive yeah that would be
amazing
like I would just give it to you at that
point
Yeah right oh uh knock - a 21 is saying
we should ask nerd fusion about
playlists I actually I should probably
talk to two 7s over there and see what
he thinks with him probably tomorrow and
Sunday cool tell him I think he's nice
sure or that I hate him it doesn't talk
to myself
sorry Anki what aw he gave me makerfaire
tickets
Wow so you guys like planned to hang out
at twitchcon is maybe changing a little
bit dun dun duh alright this was
originally posted on the forum by master
disaster and I think that pretty much
says it right there the BBC reports I
got this post in the in the chat here
the BBC reports that blackberry will
stop designing its own phones how long
ago did we say they should do this uh
how long ago did everyone say they
should do this I mean we weren't the
only ones for the last few years saying
that's fair why don't you just be a
software company why don't you just do
an Android branch or something and
become a security software specialist so
it looks like they are finally going
that route I have apparently lost the
tab but in a nutshell so John Chen and
their CEO said that he would know by
September whether the hardware business
would become profitable for blackberry
it is now September and apparently it
did not
so they are outsourcing hardware
development to partners Chen has stated
that further devices even ones with the
iconic physical keyboard would go on
sale I always wanted to make sure that
we keep having iconic devices he said we
just need to find a way to be more
efficient and be able to make money I
think we found the model so the company
sold 400,000 smartphones in its second
quarter which is less than the previous
three months yeah you didn't find the
model stop selling phones I mean like
it's a step in the right direction but
they need to just get off the platform
and just start making only software oh
man I don't understand how they keep
doing this I was looking I was actually
reading a couple other articles about
this that aren't the linked ones here
and that the notes apparently weren't
pulled from but basically they've
already got a couple of hardware
partners they've worked with I believe
it was
Foxconn and I want to say shoot it was
some other it was some other Chinese
phone maker can't remember exactly but
oh ok TCL I think is the TCL is the
other one so here we go
this one right here so the first touch
screen on the Android device to detect
50 that was released in July 2016 so to
reduce cost this was based on a phone
manufactured by TCL so the idea is
they're gonna leverage those
partnerships they're gonna kind of
blackberry brand existing hardware which
quite frankly I don't think is
inherently the worst thing ever and then
they're gonna be putting their own their
own kind of spin on Android in order to
I guess make it more secure or whatever
this is something I can't really figure
out why Google hasn't tackled like why
do we need Samsung's Knox in order to
yea optimize Android for a better
security I well okay whatever okay I
guess that's a conversation for another
day but there you go
would you consider okay here Luke you
were the last one to review a BlackBerry
device on our channel the z10 I think it
was and a while ago but yeah okay so
your takeaway from that if I recall
correctly feel free to kind of jump in
and interrupt me here but your takeaway
from that if I recall was basically
there were some things about it that
were really good including text
messaging it was responsive it was like
pretty smooth to use but not having apps
is basically the end of the world yes
okay now there were even even back then
there were ways to like ghetto sideload
Android apps but it was not great in
fact it was super dumb so would you
consider a blackberry phone if they have
a mostly stock Android looking skin and
other than that it's just a pho any
phone and with blackberry security
optimizations it's like my most
important metrics right now for phones
personally our water resistance levels
and battery life which is like why the
iPhone 7 looked kind of cool and then
I'll said it was like no headphone jack
and I was like alright probably not
gonna do that so it would have to depend
on how well they did in those categories
right one thing that I really really did
like was the BlackBerry hub so for like
an efficiency standpoint it might
actually win the BlackBerry hub was a
wonderful system I like that a lot more
than just like standard notifications
because you just see everything in one
category made it very efficient to skim
through things it's like Google inbox or
whatever that was called that we all got
kind of excited for for a little while
in the yeah but like better and for
everything instead of just your email
which was super cool but like I'll wait
and see till they come out if they have
good water resistance and good battery I
would literally consider it yeah I
actually on the subject of the iPhone 7
I was talking to one of my badminton
buddies who got an iPhone 7 and I was
like so how's it
not having a headphone jack there and
he's just like oh I actually haven't
really noticed I only use my Jaybirds
looks like wow ok I'm officially no
longer mainstream I'm officially like an
old fuddy-duddy for actually carrying
around wired earphones at all times I
can't say though like their wireless ear
plugs look incredibly stupid and I'm not
even like I'm not really a fashion dude
or whatever but they just look so done
there are wireless headphone solutions
that don't look incredibly stupid but
their's are brutal and considering Apple
often gets described as like a
technology jewelry company where like
what you're buying is a fashion
statement lifestyle tech yeah that's
kind of brutal because they're ugly as
sin so I don't know I if people start
adopting third-party headphone options I
doubt our Bluetooth I see it being a
little bit more popular but regardless
of the power of Apple to make something
trendy I think those headphones are just
fundamentally ugly and I don't think
they're gonna be able to get over that
we'll see
I mean you will see but yeah you know
white white wires on your on your
earphones that like that look grungy and
yellow in two weeks became a status
symbol so it's true
there you go I don't know man but at
least they looked cool at the start oh
okay I don't know for me I felt like I
either have to buy a charging and
headphone adapter if I were to want to
use the iPhone 7 or I would be just
unable to use it because I sew my
earphones I wear them while I sleep I
always listen to music or podcasts or
shows while I'm sleeping because it it
helps me it helps me fall asleep like it
used to take me sometimes an hour two
hours to fall asleep at night I had
horrible insomnia to the point where I
was like taking sleeping pills sometimes
just because I'd be like I really need
to be awake in the morning so I will
take this sleeping pill now because
otherwise I will not sleep
and this completely fixed it for me if
the the best one is I'll watch a show
like I'll listen to because I'm not
watching it but I'll listen to a TV show
or like episode that I've heard 20 times
and that's like it's boring and it puts
me to sleep it's great so yeah
problem solved all I have to do is wear
earphones when I sleep but I can't
charge my phone and listen to these at
the same time it doesn't have a
headphone jack so there you go
everyone's giving me advice and twitch
chat I'm not asking for advice I have
fixed the problem if he's been doing
this for years and it works very well
for him I think he's happy it's great
anywhere from like five minutes it's get
medical tape and tape over your ears so
that the headphones can Bluetooth in and
they won't fall out while you sleep it's
it's no man no man you're doing it wrong
brilliant gotta get on that medical
taping Wow
the entire twitch chat is just like oh
francisco ella is officially fired from
watching the show i listen to this show
because it's boring
so are we i mean okay this this demands
a strawpoll oh this demands a strawpoll
okay
are we your sleep aid knowing that you
might help people fall asleep at night I
mean I guess that's a useful public
service but like come on or are we your
comfy pillow that is really not what I
was going for here so far 100 percent of
the vote okay there we go there we go
it's getting a little better oh oh oh
come on come on
what
54% yes guys fight the 54% okay yes
come on hey the ways I help you sleep we
don't talk about on this
we only allude to them right yeah and I
can't do it from here buddy oh we've got
over a thousand votes I mean that is
like that's significant enough that it
could be considered the definition of
significant Oh
I'm sad now okay well at least this
answers a question that you and I have
posed to each other a handful of times
why do people watch the land show and
now we know yeah because they're tired
yeah and it's time to go to bed so maybe
like our time zoning thing was wrong we
should just be going for night time
instead of like midday I had no way of
knowing bro I had no way of knowing okay
all right hard drives are on the ropes
okay there we go
no conspiracy theory that's why we're
late every time because we're trying to
be later you're waiting for the weigh-in
showing kind of dozing off that's right
okay good you press the button and then
you just fade off that's right you drift
to sleep everything's good and then you
never wake up unless you feel refreshed
yeah yeah okay so this was supposed to
bite it's me on the forum SSDs are
steadily displacing hard drives in more
applications but nvme this is
interesting this is from Tom's Hardware
nvme shaping up to be the dark horse
that may put the venerable hard disk
drive to rest so this is based on
Samsung predicting a collision course
for SSD pricing and hard drive pricing
dun dun da look at that you think that
will mean hard drives will be done
because well the enterprise sure sorry
in like enterprise like cloud store
sure yeah at the home they'll probably
die off quite a bit faster but like
being able to put critical stuff on a
hard drive that you can recover if it
fails kind of nice storing things on a
variety of different mediums is a good
thing mm-hmm no I see hard drives
becoming okay so so here's the things to
look at so number one have we reached
the limit of what people actually need
to store like yes people take lots of
photos and they take lots of videos on
their phones and that's one of the
things that hard drive makers have loved
talking about at conferences or at or in
presentations of conference calls where
they'll kind of be like yeah the data
storage needs of the world there's going
like this but the reality of it is that
cloud storage pricing is such that if
people wanted to store their data
somewhere where they theoretically you
know don't have to worry about it
getting lost or or being vulnerable to a
failed device cloud storage for the
amount that most people have like a
couple terabytes
is pretty reasonable yeah so have we
gotten have we reached that threshold
where SSDs are starting to hit that 1 to
2 terabyte capacity where they hold
pretty much everything you could need
unless you have a gigantic Steam library
and you don't have you have dial-up
internet so you need to preload
everything so that you'd never have to
download it or whatever so we're talking
edge cases where most people can hold
everything they could need on their
phone or their computer or backed up in
the cloud especially looking at the way
that ok Google for example gives you
unlimited photo storage through photos
if you allow them to compress the image
yeah what else do people store you
stream all your music sorry go ahead go
ahead I'm done besides in - - when did I
bring this up like last week I was like
winner-winner people not gonna have SATA
cables anymore yeah yep so like this
might I still think that's a little ways
out but this might kind of
advance that up even a little bit more
it's gonna be really interesting seeing
computers that don't need space to put
drives yep yep and then I think at that
point everything is either backed up in
the cloud or you have you'll have the
enthusiasts who are you've got the guys
like me that have an unread box in their
closet or something because they want to
be able to transcode video on the fly
and they want to be able to do this they
want to store uncompress uncompressed
blu-ray rips on on a networked machine
so that they can play it back you know
on any screen in the house like there's
going to be enthusiasts and I think for
guys like that like the hard drive is by
no means dead for me
not even close yeah but I'm also at the
point where one of the videos that I
have coming soon is the the most
cost-effective 100 terabytes server and
what I learned when I was working on
that video is that with Seagate's
archive drives which sent it around
three cents a gigabyte or something like
that like just obscenely low-cost with
an archive drive I can saturate a
typical gigabit home network already so
you could do a hundred terabytes for I
kind of want to pull up my spreadsheet
now so I don't give you guys the wrong
number but that video is coming soon but
our Seagate's archive drives our 24/7
rated drives they run it fifty nine
hundred rpm and you can buy a hundred
terabytes of hard drive for cost per gig
is a two point nine cents and a hundred
terabytes for a three thousand dollars
okay
I think from an enthusiast standpoint
all that number needs to do is fall down
to another half or another third and I
think a hundred terabytes is reasonably
all that most people could need and
there will always be the exceptions the
people that want to back up the internet
or whatever the only channel where
you'll hear someone say I genuinely
think a hundred terabytes is all that
anyone's prob
we gonna be neat and obviously you know
50 years from now that might not be the
case but you look at the trends we are
not on the same path that we were before
of you know going from 480i
being an acceptable you know video
standard to you know now we're at 4k
explosion and data in data requirements
in order to get to a point where the
quality is acceptable and now the trend
is towards dedicated hardware to handle
video compression and video decoding so
where the hardware and the devices is so
much more powerful that we don't have to
have these obscene bit rates in order to
get decent image quality and so I'm just
kind of looking at it going yeah
everything could be compressed
on-the-fly everything could be
everything could be it could be decoded
and could be converted on the fly and I
think that is like a ton of storage I
think it's just huge yeah I have yet to
determine if I think 4k blu-ray is worth
is worth it I actually all my 4k
blu-rays and my xbox 1s are here though
so I'm gonna be trying it out very soon
so is that what those those blu-rays
that you just ordered our HDR stuff yes
cuz HDR does genuinely look really good
yes but that's a different conversation
I think because HDR can also be handled
again it's not like going from 480i to
1080p HD R can be added without
necessarily ok so we doubled the
capacity of a blu-ray disc going from
blu-ray to 4k blu-ray we managed to
quadruple the resolution and add HDR so
we added a bunch more contrast and color
information and quadrupled the
resolution we doubled the data so we're
not on that same trajectory anymore
that's kind of the point I'm trying to
make is I think that we're using
processing power which continues to
increase and is pretty darn impressive
these days even in tiny little devices
to compensate for what we normally would
have just added more storage for
and that's been partly out of necessity
because storage hasn't really continued
to scale in the same way that it has and
I think that's why Samsung is making
this bold prediction where they're kind
of going okay SSD upgrades this is
actually amazing
40 million SSDs they're saying SSD
upgrades sometime in 2012 it looks like
overtook CPU upgrades as the most common
upgrade that people make to a computer
and they're also saying that the SSD
doesn't have to reach exactly the same
pricing as a hard drive gig for gig it
just has to reach a point where and
we're there now where 256 gigs for an
SSD is about the same as a one terabyte
hard drive so that entry-level capacity
versus that entry-level capacity they're
saying it just has to be good enough and
512 gigs for me is that sweet spot where
I don't really feel like I need an
additional storage drive anymore I can
still have like the two or three big
games that I'm playing right now and I
can still have all the data that I need
as long as I have an ass and I think
everyone should have an AZ anyway I
don't
I still don't personally feel like
that's enough in my desktop are you a
one terabyte guy I'm you're a four
terabyte what the heck do you have on
your computer that takes up four
terabytes and I have a sixteen I know
about your NAS it sags that's an
important part of my original question -
mine is slightly special you say so
because it's all the games because I
hear ya it doesn't take that long to
download them haha isn't that bad but I
don't want to sit and download games on
streaming ok don't like be able to have
everything available I think you should
just go I scuzzy then because your nas
would support a nice cozy target what if
I don't know that's pretty slow that
mass is not that fast alright fair
enough you know for a long time it's not
really you know what's funny I don't
normally notice when gaming off of a
hard drive because generally speaking
game developers are good at masking
those loading times
I mean maybe part of it is that it's a
heck of a lot
than an optical disc and so many games
are designed for optical media still um
but when I do run into trouble so so my
my home theater PC the one in my living
room actually just has a small boot SSD
like it's actually kind of an older
config at like 128 gig boot SSD so I
pretty much can't put more than one
triple a game on it if I want to have
anything else on it the amount of people
that are not only like not not
necessarily that it's their job but the
amount of people that are even just
doing it as a hobby yada yada yada
twitch streaming YouTube all that kind
of stuff
young people that are doing you for fun
human people that are trying to get into
it and I'm successful at it is huge to
the point where a lot of people that I
talk to my day-to-day when I tell them
what I do go like oh yeah I've been kind
of like drying that out or I tried that
out at one point in time right footage
it's a nightmare
computing stuff is a nightmare and like
twitch streamers I know a not that
insignificant number of them that
actually archive all of their footage
right I still I still think that's a
niche case but I don't
yeah but like there's a lot of people
who have dabbling in things like YouTube
right now right yep that's true that's
true
I still think hard drives will hold on
but I think it's gonna be instead of the
the thing that everyone buys for every
single computer ever accessory purchase
yeah yeah
so either an accessory purchase for a
little external drive yeah or when
you're ready to move to the big time I
think it I think nez I think now's moves
in yeah um so this is interesting this
is one of the challenges for hard drive
is that there's roughly a forty dollar
price floor hard drives have never been
under you know like 39.99 not unless
it's a lost leader or something along
those lines whereas and this is
something that Samsung saying SSDs can
scale well below $40 in much smaller
quantities because the hard drive no
matter what no matter how cheaply you
can make them you
still need a casing Motors heads other
communiy the the actual platters
themselves so the platters and the
complexity of the motors and how many
heads you need and how many platters are
in it all that increases in cost as you
scale up but you can only go down to one
platter
yeah and that costs how much it costs
there's pretty much nothing we can do
about it it's not really going to get
any better
so Samsung also figures that SSDs have
displaced hard drives in 40% of new
notebooks and they predict in the region
55 percent in 2018 and I totally get it
and I personally definitely prefer SSDs
back to my story I don't mind gaming off
of a hard drive in general and I forget
a lot of the time that my media PC has a
2 terabyte hard drive to go along with
that small SSD but the other day I was
trying to install a game by copying the
files over the network while trying to
play a game and I loaded my game it's
like Lego Batman or something like not
the world's most demanding game and the
game sat there at the loading screen the
entire time that those files were
copying and then as soon as they were
done game loaded that's terrible like I
can't even
basically comprehend using like a hard
drive based computer as my daily driver
now anytime I use some ones that set up
that way I'm like man you can make your
life so much better with a little bit of
an upgrade here and then I point them to
my like hard drive SS the configuration
video thing there even if you buy like a
really small one like a 128 gig or
something you can still live and it'll
still be far better and 128 KS as these
are like pretty cheap these days alright
so techrax has convinced people the
video has ten point three million views
and apparently I just opened it in
another browser so you trying to know
this I mean it's iPhone 7 so it can't be
that old so 10 days ago techrax has
convinced people to add headphone jacks
to their iPhone 7s I haven't actually
talked to him about this yet but I think
it's pretty funny
with every iPhone hoax every time this
happens and it's like make your iPhone
waterproof with these easy steps hit it
with a hammer you know like it's just
just terrible terrible ideas tightening
the handset in the metal vise the screen
starts to flicker he promises his
viewers this is normal he just drills a
hole kind of randomly he doesn't even
pretend like he's not even pulling a oh
shoot my yeah Theo Jo he's not even
pulling a Theo Jo here where he's like
trying to look like there's some kind of
science and methodology behind it he
just pulls out a drill drills a hole on
the bottom goes boom there now it works
I'm amazed he was able to get far enough
into the iPhone that he was able to
insert a three and a half millimeter
jack while it was still working you know
what I noticed which I thought was kind
of hilarious it was like okay there's
the screen flickering when it's in the
vise thing but he addresses that when he
plugs his headphones in it's still
playing audio over the speakers I know
was yeah
I don't I also wonder at the same time
like if people are just saying they did
it to get attention yeah and then that
multiplies the bees in the video because
everyone like laughing at stupid people
right yeah that seems pretty possible
oh speaking of things that are possible
I would have never imagined this to be
possible tinder for sperm donors swipe
right for a sperm donor
the London sperm bank is now taking
orders for customized bads in the UK
they released a tinder esque mobile app
that lets women filter potential sperm
donors based on traits like ethnicity
occupation personality type eye color
and more that's cool the search results
are labeled with numbers like donor 1000
- instead of names so without getting
into too many details about my family
history what I will say oh wow is that
sperm donors can lie and some of them
might fill out their form saying that
they are oh I don't know say for example
a doctor and might turn out to be a milk
truck driver so I don't know what steps
they're going through to prevent odd in
this case but anyway the app also gives
women the option to create wish list
alerts for possible surrogate fathers if
they already know what they want and
aren't interested in browsing it will
notify them when their preferred
characteristics become available the
selected sample will be sent to the
fertility specialist where the woman is
undergoing treatment once a
approximately twelve thousand dollar
payment is made through the app and
there you go some critics say this is
great this is from the queues edcom
articles say that there's a difference
between narrow and down food delivery
options by cuisines and choosing sperm
donors by eye color the abundance of
choice and narrowness of selection
category as they say could exacerbate
the eugenic tendencies that already
exist at traditional sperm banks Wow
so yeah there you go it's legal what I
would hope that it would do is when you
swipe right say so you're like accepting
it then like sends you a more detailed
profile
apparently the all the donors in the app
have to be approved by the British and
Rallo G Society the British
fertilization society and the human
fertilization and embryology authority
to ensure they don't have any infections
or genetic conditions so at least
there's that going for them how do you
define a genetic um I don't know like
could stupidity be a genetic condition
because alright so thanks for tuning
into the land show this week guys we
will see you again next week same
bat-time same bat-channel
i probably won't be here so Luke you'll
probably be on land show upload duty do
you know how to do it yeah no I think
what I'll do is I will screen record me
doing the entire thing tonight and then
I think I did that here wait I'm just
gonna do that I'll put it in the land
show folder on the server sorry well
we'll take this conversation offline
thanks again next next thanks again next
week thanks again I'm rolling the intro
someone in twitch chat wants me to say
