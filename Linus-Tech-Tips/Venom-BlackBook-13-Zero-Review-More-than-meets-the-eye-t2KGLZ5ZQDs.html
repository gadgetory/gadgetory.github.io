black book 15 I told them I loved the
performance and loved the aluminum
chassis but I felt like the price was
pretty expensive
I also confessed that 13 to 14 inches is
my ideal size and that no 15 inch really
had a fair shot at stealing my heart so
now they've come back swinging with the
black book 13 zero which targets a more
aggressive price point and looks at
least on the surface like an absolute
stunner let's see how it fares
cooller masters new master keys Pro L
and Pro s keyboards provide sixteen
point seven million color RGB
backlighting genuine Cherry MX switches
and an industry-leading ARM Cortex
processor learn more the link in the
video description now I could say that
zero means something like zero
compromises are so thin in lines to feel
like you're carrying nothing but based
on that I know that the venom guys are a
bunch of gamers with a focus on selling
gaming laptops I suspect it means zero
dedicated graphics card so the zero
whether it carries Intel's Ultrabook
certification sticker or not is pretty
much an ultrabook sorry gamers with that
said it's clearly a better-than-average
ultrabook from the outset it's available
in a variety of configurations all the
way down to a very attractive $9.99 US
dollar model with the core i5 and a 120
gig SSD OS drive with a 500 gig hard
drive all the way up to the top of the
line $2,500
midnight edition with a core i7 6500 you
ain't gigs of ram a top-of-the-line 512
gig samsung 950 pro m2 PCI Express based
SSD and a 2 terabyte Samsung 850 Evo
SATA SSD for storage it's got an Intel
82-62 by 2 a/c wireless card that
managed over 20 megabytes per second
sustained transfers in my tests
it's called Windows 10 Pro and a healthy
45 watt hour lithium-ion battery
it features an all aluminum chassis
designed with perhaps a greater
propensity for picking up greasy
fingerprints and a little bit more flex
than I'd like not to mention that the
hinge isn't the premium one finger style
but it makes up for at least some of all
that by being crazy light right around
1.4 kilos or 3 pounds overall I'd say
the device feels pretty darn good
io is a pretty good mix with a single
type C port and a headphone jack and
nothing else it sorry I was thinking of
the MacBook that's right No
it's got power in a USB 2.0 port and a
headphone microphone combo jack on the
left with a USB 3.0 port an HDMI port a
Type C five gigabit USB 3.0 port not
Thunderbolt unfortunately and an SD card
reader on the right I love the SD card
reader I mean the number of times I have
needed one of those in the field let me
tell ya not good flipping this puppy
open reveals something that may feel
like a compromise to some but that I
don't actually mind I actually ordered
my custom-built XPS 15 with a 1080p
display because I don't feel like at
this size the higher dpi makes enough of
a difference to justify the battery life
that I'm giving up and apparently Venom
agrees because every model of blackbook
13-0 is equipped with a 1080p IPS
display but while the resolution spec of
this panel is not that impressive in
other ways it's among the best that I've
seen the blacks are midnight black and
there is astonishment a quite bleed even
though venom has the guts to ship it
with a black desktop background as a
communications device the 13 0 is a bit
of a mixed bag on the one hand the
microphone actually sounds pretty good
but on the other the 1 megapixel camera
doesn't perform particularly well in
either backlit or even front lit
scenarios with the subject ending up
quite washed out and pale-looking so
while the speakers are ok about all
you'd expect for a notebook this size
making it fine as a casual
movie-watching device on the couch it is
not ideal for regular video conferencing
the keyboard is what I would
characterize as pretty good the keycaps
wobble more than I'd like on a truly
premium device and the stroke action is
a little bit mushy but for me there are
really more important things on a thin
and light the adjustable backlight is
great and the 13-0 delivered
on typing speed and accuracy as well as
the overall layout the arrow keys have
that annoying up-down combo close
together thing but I think Apple started
but it's otherwise bog-standard with
function modifiers available for pretty
much anything that I would need to do
including one to disable the touchpad
which leads us to that I guess the
touchpad has some high points and also
some low points from the things that I
like perspective it's got the full range
of gesture controls which can be set up
within the Elan tech control panel it's
got a satisfying pad click with no
discrete buttons and it does a pretty
darn good job of rejecting both palms
and my click finger when I'm operating
it two-handed but it comes with what is
for me a bit of an annoying flaw
hopefully one that can be addressed with
a driver tweak kerb something along
those lines there's a for me perceptible
leg between moving my finger across the
trackpad and seeing my actions on the
screen this is true with the notebook
plugged in or running off battery and I
even went as far as to reinstall windows
using the included 16 gig USB Drive
which is nice to have by the way I
prefer that to a recovery partition as
an enthusiast which resolved this issue
when I encountered it on the blade 14
2015 moving on though there is more good
stuff the bundled software package is
very Spartan basically some alternate
browsers and not much else
Norton is on there but it's a full year
subscription rather than a 30-day
subsidized trial so I'll give that a
neutral rating leaving really only a few
things to talk about in the part of this
video where I would normally talk about
gaming performance haha
acoustics are better than I expected
with the 13-0 managing to run fanless
quite frequently even with the i7
installed so you'll do better with an i5
skew and while the battery takes over
four hours to charge which is agonizing
when you're waiting around for it to run
a battery life benchmark the good news
is that in PC markets productivity suite
it managed to run for well over three
hours continuously which is a pretty
darn solid score leading us finally to
the conclusion in a market that did not
contain the razor blade stealth the
black book zero would be a savior to
folks who wanted a great ultra book
experience without dealing with the
hassle of running Windows on a MacBook
Air
there are some minor quirks in the real
world it's a less obvious choice but not
an entirely invalid one while the blade
stealth features an undeniably stronger
thinner industrial design Thunderbolt
and RGB backlit keyboard and a higher
resolution display across all SKUs it's
thinner fans will work harder to control
CPU thermals and it's much less
configurable spec wise with a maximum of
eight gigs of ram soldered to the
mainboard and only the n dot to drive
being upgradable the black book 13 0 by
contrast and this one hits pretty hard
for a heavy Google Chrome tab users like
myself manages to cram the same capacity
battery a two and a half inch drive Bay
which is pretty nice if your ultrabook
is your primary machine as it is for so
many people these days and a sodium
memory socket into it's only marginally
thicker shell and while venom doesn't
advertise the capability of the 1302 run
a single 16 gig ddr3l sodium I tried it
with a 1333 megahertz intelligent memory
branded stick that I had lying around
and it worked perfectly that right there
is a huge win from my perspective on
what is already a very compelling little
product provided that they can quickly
sort out the touchpad leg so thanks for
