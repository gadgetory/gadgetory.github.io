T and their slogan is building dreams so
evidently this is a dream actually it's
not a dream this is from there are vena
extreme division and it is the GS 6400
be so I'm going to go ahead and assume
that GS is some kind of say for example
gaming series and B means that it's
probably black all right there's some
notes here about the case but we're
actually going to take it out of the box
and we don't look need to look too
closely at that I have once again done
absolutely zero preparation for an
unboxing so we will be discovering as we
go along all of the things that are
important to know about the GS 6,400
feet now this is not a brand new case it
is the demo unit so I feel like I'm
cheating a little bit on the unboxing
but I guess that's kind of life so yeah
there are no seals to break and it's not
gonna be quite new hopefully you guys
will forgive me and we can move past
this ok now I think I put it right side
up but I'm not actually sure I think so
the only way to find out Oh B stands for
blue now we know learn something every
day all right i'm gonna put this here as
a cheat sheet that's the English side
excellent so let's have a look at this
case actually it's kind of neat it
reminds me a little bit of the the old
alien rare chassis just a little bit not
very much not very much at all actually
ok let's start with the front of the
case so at the front of the case we have
ventilation and you can see that we are
actually perhaps missing one of these I
guess that's what happens when you have
a demo unit case maybe came off with the
okay well we'll just have to continue on
this voyage of discovery without the
platform quarter inch of a cover so as
you can see these are all mesh but they
do have have a foam filter behind them
so you're not going to get a ton of dust
buildup in these you can see we have to
stealth five and a quarter inch drive
bay covers okay there you are we have a
compact flash reader SD and then a bunch
of stuff that doesn't really matter and
then on the top we have the power switch
which appears to have a blue LED light
under it and then we have some fan
buttons under there we have a little
esata that's kind of a neat idea so what
kind of a cable yeah you just use like a
standard internal to internal cable and
then you could plug that into your dry
that's kind of neat and then there's a
regular e SATA port for USB front audio
hard drive led as well as a reset switch
are all hidden down there more
ventilation in the top on this side you
find just a plain panel camera man watch
your angle so you don't get spotted
there and then we have a release latch
back here which we will need to undo the
thumb screws in order to access so we'll
do that to some screws on this side too
fun screws on the side then all the
thumbscrews will be released and then we
can use the tool list mechanism ha there
we are so we'll go ahead and put that
side panel down I'm going to go ahead
and remove the other side panel you can
see here has a little button that you
just press on and then you pull back so
it's pretty straightforward all right
and we'll check out the interior layout
a little bit here so you can see the
120mm fan at the back one two three four
five six seven PCI expansion slots so
that's fairly standard and then we've
got this is one of the features that's
mentioned on the side of the box this is
kind of an exclusive well they call it
exclusive coolers for video card
refrigeration but what I call it is fans
to blow down on your video card which is
also very useful so these are 2 80
millimeter fans they just mount on this
little swing arm that conveniently has
little built-in wiring so while that
would make the fens a little bit hard to
replace it does mean that it's a no
hassle setup as far as if you wanted to
use for stock fans these are probably
yet these are LED fans all I don't know
what color they are I would guess blue
based on that we have a blue case and
that the picture here says well doesn't
say anything but seems to have blue fans
inside it all right accessories
hopefully I didn't just break that so
here's all of your screws that even
include the screwdriver that's kind of
neat as well as a little microfiber
cloth for getting fingerprints off the
finish of the case so we can see if
there's anything else in here of note an
extra pc i just cover ok i'm very random
give them that the ones in here are
vented pci and they are black and not
grey like the extra one that's provided
that's ok I won't complain hey extras
are extras right alright so let's see
what else we got here as you can see
this is a standard ATX case so while it
is a little bit wide there aren't any
extra eatx mounting holes so what that
means is that you can't mount a huge
eatx server board but you can mount
something like a rampage three extreme
which use a standard ATX holes but it's
a little bit wider so they give you that
extra space up in the top you can see we
have 2 120 millimeter fans which
unfortunately aren't spaced correctly
for round mounting a radiator but it
looks like there wouldn't be space to
mount a radiator in here anyway because
the top of the motherboard would be
right here and then if you have any
MOSFET cooling or anything i would
probably interfere with it anyhow okay
cable management we've got our typical
cable management holes so your power
supply mounts on the bottom you can see
that there is a dust filter over the
intake for the power
supply so that's a separate cooling zone
for your power supply you can also mount
another fan here either one 20 mil or 1
40 millimeter and then front panel
connectors galore to go with all of the
front panel stuff that we showed you
before and then let's talk a little bit
about the two lists mount oh this is
good yes cpu cutout nice big one that
means you can swap your cpu cooler even
if you have one that requires a back
plate without taking the motherboard out
of the case alright let's have a look at
the two lists mounting for the optical
drives okay so that's pretty
straightforward so there's two little
spikes in there you press that in locks
you drive in place you press this button
it opens it up okay that was easy and
then move it's kind of fancy look at
that so this is how the whole hard drive
cage comes out so you can take this
whole thing out assemble your hard
drives onto these little rails so you
can see you can install either three and
a half inch or two and a half inch
drives they have umpteen million
mounting and ventilation holes on the
bottom of them although they are quite
sturdy feeling and then you can slide
the whole thing back you can see this is
a 1 40 millimeter cooling fan here in
the front slide that whole thing back in
to open up the hard drives all you do is
dead then adjust to the left and then
you can pull them out and back in that's
kind of neat actually I don't know how
shipping proof it is but it's a
definitely different and then on the
back of the case we find not a whole lot
to speak of we do have some cable
management spots here so you can use
these tie downs to taking some of the
cables that you routed around the back
and make sure that they don't cross each
other when you're trying to close your
your other side panel but I think that
pretty much covers everything I wanted
to say about the sin tgs 6400 be yeah
hey there's the adapter cable you need
for that front SATA thing cool just in
case you were wondering let me just see
if there's anything that I've forgotten
Hayden cable system removable hard drive
bays front cooler refrigeration card
reader second looks like I talked about
everything so thank you for checking out
my unboxing and don't forget to
