nipple related no it's not surprising
right
anyways when I came back from Taiwan I
came to yvr the airport is near and the
statue with nipples nope this at some
point I'll try also in Richmond by the
way Vancouver International Airport not
in Vancouver yes it's in the Greater
Vancouver area that's true so or a
Greater Vancouver Regional District as
it's actually called the GTA is the
greater toronto area the GVR geez okay
anyways the Wi-Fi network there does one
of those things we have to like approve
your login thing with through a portal
and whatever and I was trying to do it
it wasn't working and I needed it in at
that point in time so is like whatever
and turned my Wi-Fi off didn't really
think about it a little while later
using my phone and it's like oh your
Wi-Fi your data has been turned off
because you're at your maximum my
warning didn't come through or I swiped
it without realizing it because I hate
it when notifications load while you're
in your notification bar
I might have swiped it without actually
seeing it so my data is dead and I think
I'm like six days into the month or
something so that sucks
I have a dumb phone for a while well
your smart phone just a dumb music yeah
so I guess yeah you did that's okay
because I can work nipples into anything
speak up
people are asking us to turn the mic up
but I just did a test recording and it
was fine so I guess it was I guess I had
the volume a little high actually I
don't even know why that worked at all
but I what I just did in terms of
testing maybe I could load up the stream
and see if people are messing with me in
the meantime why don't you let them know
what fantastic topics we have for them
today so we have the the whole
catastrophe around Team Viewer all the
counts being hacked into or passwords
being known or whatever because those
aren't really the same thing but anyways
we'll talk about that later docker has
officially filed for bankruptcy and is
saying some other stuff Sony officially
confirms the 4k ready PlayStation but I
believe it's not being announced at e3
or something and I don't actually know a
fourth topic that's interesting you
sound wonderful to me by the way
do I yeah and that like 38% on my system
volume so okay space mining space mining
what I don't know I didn't see that
alright that's a base mining we might
not talk about that yeah we may not get
to that yeah
- not turning your Wi-Fi back on for a
week or maybe not gross maybe it's like
hot oh you're into that sort of thing
lady bone spit yeah that's it that's
probably not good all right apparently
the intro is lab well you know what you
guys there is only so much I know
there's only so much I can do
Jim's address says ow and also that it's
pre-recorded I think no it's not
pre-recorded all right so let's get into
some topics first up we've got and I
actually have no idea whether whether
Luke said that this was going to be one
of our one of our means this week
Gawker is no more at least in its
current form maybe someday it will reach
its final form but that won't be its
current form they filed for bankruptcy
and have said that they will sell the
company the headline says to Ziff Davis
or someone else that I don't think it's
necessarily Gawker saying they're gonna
sell it as if Davis it's that as if
Davis has an offer in on them for
somewhere to the tune of ninety to a
hundred million dollars you know maybe I
should just buy Gawker what yeah I know
you know for a fact that I don't that's
not gonna work can't afford that and
also just doesn't sound like a good idea
again why would we do that if we could
just like Lifehacker instead of tweet
about this earlier I was like I don't
really care well the rest of it but if
life hacker survives that would be cool
yeah you could just consume like just
them I'd be down with that I mean
theoretically some of the upstairs
office space for that make them all
comedians theoretically they could sell
individual publications so so Gawker is
life hacker Jezebel Deadspin gawker.com
is moto
Kotaku Jalopnik and Isabel and ya know
you said dad's been actually but you
said it twice which is important right
for people who didn't hear you go first
yeah um so out of all of those yeah I
think Lifehacker
I didn't used to mind Gizmodo but I
remember the last time I went on that
site I liked I think if that lines up
nope how old were you in 2009 19 you
were not well 18 for most of it 18 fits
okay so I was close very close I was
actually quite close okay so basically
yeah they're filing for a chapter more
accurate um actually yeah I think so
that's right around there um so they're
there they've announced their chapter 11
filing basically that puts them in
protection from creditors for the time
being while they sort of entertain
offers to buy the company Gawker and
Nick Denton have said that they will not
pay Hulk Hogan and Peter Thiel the 140
million dollars they have told their
employees that they still plan to fight
the case and to operate the publishing
business while they do so but Ziff Davis
has come out and said there's let me
just see if I can bring up the the
article here so this was in an internal
memo it does say for less than a hundred
million dollars yeah like I'm assuming
not a ton less there's conflicting
reports so this particular one on RICO
dotnet says for around 100 million but
it should be noted that they may end up
paying more because this is just their
initial bid for it and actually nothing
to do necessarily with how much it'll
end up selling for so someone else could
make a counteroffer yep yep it could end
up being a bidding war over Jezebel yeah
which I guess someone wants apparently I
didn't know that these sites as a whole
were still that big I had no idea online
written media publications we're still
worth like tens of millions of dollars
each I mean I guess it's sort of
enormous amounts of traffic this is a
really good clip with Nick Denton
basically saying nope I stand by the
decision to publish that even in light
of everything that has happened he's
expressed a lot of frustration with
Peter Thiel basically public basically
funding this lawsuit
as a way to I think I forget I was
reading some article about it but the
the quote from him was something to the
effect don't quote me on this that's the
quote of a quote that's not an accurate
quote but sick so the so something to
the effect of that it's not vengeance
but it's more of like a cautionary sort
of like it's more of a deterrent I think
was something close to the word that was
used against publishing articles that
are basic that basically amount to
bullying so that was that was sort of
how he interpreted the Hulk Hogan
article where this sort of this
individual was being bullied by a
publication published an article and
indeed a sex tape video of him
banging to use the term that the kids
used these days I think a friend's wife
you gotta throw that in at me yeah I
guess that's still a thing if you're an
old man well like how long is banging
been around for a long time I'm sure my
dad is like well-versed with that term
the term or what are we talking I'm here
so probably both it just being honest
it's almost father's day you got nine
days to figure it out to figure out if
he's your father
well-made what I could there could be a
situation okay so Luke's parents aside
and their whatever they don't still
watch watch oh do they they probably do
oh that's a shame my mom and dad um
so it'll be a court supervised deduction
and basically the the lawsuit one way or
the other will have to be resolved
before nick de odd before excuse me as
if Davis is gonna have any interest in
in taking taking possession of it and
yeah that's basically how it went down
would this make you think twice about
publishing a sex tape online effectives
why why would we publish a sex tape
online I didn't say we yeah I said you
said okay we should do this but we
should do it with like like computer
components oh man we should like make a
fake Hulk Hogan no I want and have it
water cool someone else's computer I
want no part of any of this I just want
we've got people asking for us to review
a sexbot okay robots
let's turn so let's talk let's talk
seriously again for a minute would you
do an objective review of a sex robot
okay I mean we'd have to be careful what
we show and be role and not in b-roll
but would you would you benchmark it and
host the video I think I think like the
the journalistic side of me is like yeah
and then there's like I'm in a
relationship no so but what if the I
think is happening if it's a robot
probably is it like because I mean
they're not that sophisticated at this
point yeah I think basically they just
do pre-programmed you are attempting to
because this this ties into another
conversation which is like is porn okay
while you're in a relationship and this
is like stuff you need to decide in your
relationship yeah the other thing as a
general statement I mean with you and
your partner yes
it's porn okay and then on top of that
is VR porn okay because they're actually
pretty different right yeah
the airport is very much putting you in
that scenario yeah with like like
directional audio so you feel like
you're there and like if the person is
talking to you you can hear where it's
coming from like all right like crazy
stuff
yeah just like on another level and then
you're stepping up again you think so
I think each one of those will reduce
the amount of
you don't think actually uh I would I
would argue I would argue the other way
so I think porn is where it is let's
establish that porn is a baseline okay
and you know your baseline could be it's
like super okay and mine could be it's
super not okay or the other way around
whatever
let's call two-dimensional porn the
baseline and let's talk like who
dimensionalize likes join the screen
let's talk like straight guy on girl if
you're a straight person like like like
vanilla porn like sure not like animals
or whatever because it wasn't really
okay like I'm thinking like two
two-dimensional like just kind of
vanilla porn
whatever fits in your preferences yeah
like whatever would be vanilla for you
everyone's vanilla can be a little
different you know chocolate strawberry
vanilla we're talking vanilla okay so
that's our baseline okay I would make
the argument that a robot is actually
less akin to a real-life sexual
experience then I see we are coming from
with that but you also have problems
where and certainly less than that
employ assisted VR twice this would be
ours
way up there um with the robot though
you are directly trying to replace the
person in the actions that they do and
it is possible to get somewhat
emotionally attached to a robot mm-hmm
so like you are actually attempting to
replace the functionality of the partner
yeah which is also why VR toy assisted
would probably would that top the robot
for you I don't know they're both like
so these are both like no zone for you
remember we're talking when you're in a
relationship and remember your no zone
can be sort of what you're comfortable
with someone else
engaging in while you're in a
relationship yeah like it goes a two-way
street
yeah yeah so are both of those gray area
at the very least - si si okay with a
need like a discussion okay okay
interesting
ci how did we get here I don't know but
I
hi I I wholly disagree okay I think that
the robe and then okay and I'm saying
inanimate object I understand that not
all of them are completely inanimate
some of them like blink and stuff yeah
but I would make the argument that an
inanimate object is less like a real
experience than an actor on a screen but
it's not happening directly to you
that's true nothing's happening to you I
mean let's face it you're doing all the
work in either scenario that might be
true in relationships as well Wow shots
by here that birthday no that's not true
at all but I'm saying for some people
that is a reality it's it's I'm sorry
but like it is okay sure
fair enough people are saying next topic
is probably right yeah is next topic
Sony officially confirms the 4k ready
PlayStation excellent original article
here is from confirms a ps4 console
upgrade but it won't be at e3 which
raises the question what will be at e3
people are asking me like it can be
techs and stuff they're like you've done
e3 before are you going this year I was
like nope like oh why not well you know
what's funny is we missed a year when
III was like the yeah and then we
were like okay we'll do it next year
but the problem is that we're not in the
console mindset like we don't even
understand what qualifies as like a big
III for console people because it's all
just kind of III yeah so it's like yeah
all the consoles are launching this year
we don't go the next year all the
consoles launched last year we go and
it's like here's some game with games
with some tessellation there's no
problem is even if we did go the
previous year it was probably just
quino's wasn't it just keynotes like I'm
pretty sure we just watched those in the
office I remember like yeah you
kids we were both scripting and half
watching at the same time like we
basically more or less went just
virtually not to tie back to the
previous conversation yeah I mean on
that subject man I went to I think
keynotes yeah two keynotes at Computex
this year I went to one let's just not
do them anymore yep they are the worst
thing ever
yep there is nothing that I can learn in
a keynote that I can't learn and like my
yeah the the most valuable thing I think
we could do from a keynote and the the
keynote that I went to was an in video
one and what I did was I just periscope
live stream to the whole thing which
like mm-hmm I did that because I don't
think it was being live streamed right
the the stream that I did twitch stream
of at the Nvidia event when I didn't
have a table and was like crammed in
these tiny freaking seats in the back
trying to hold my camera up while
supporting my laptop was horrible I
don't even really know why people
watched I tried to like I tried to even
get reactions from like J and the other
people that are sitting beside me and I
turned the camera and the HDMI cable
would disconnect because it wasn't a
very stable connection but there's like
live tweets but then we don't have to be
there in order to do that right so this
is actually this is actually sort of an
ongoing an ongoing scandal so I don't
know if some of you have seen it but
SourceFed is claiming that Google
manipulated search results in favor of
Hillary Clinton's actually a very
well-constructed video a very compelling
sounding argument for for how big this
has become I'm surprised it doesn't have
way more views yeah it's actually only
got about a quarter million views let's
go ahead and pop that up on our screen
here so they basically say okay look
here's the popularity of certain search
terms for example Hillary Clinton
indictment and Hillary Clinton India you
can see indictment is much more popular
than India according to Google's own
interest over time and they point out
that when you actually enter Hillary
Clinton IND into Google search it comes
up with India
India independent voters Indiana
campaign absolutely nothing about
indictment as a suggested search with
the argument being made by SourceFed
being that you should be suggesting
search topics based on autocomplete
based on what people are actually
searching for that would start with
those letters so this is this is very
quickly turning in they also showed like
I think was Yahoo and Bing typing the
exact same thing in Yahoo and being
reacted the exact same way that they
would have expected yeah so indictment
was the top suggested with that said I
wouldn't use Bing search as an
indication of what is relevant
necessarily although they make again a
good points very well constructed video
actually I watched the whole thing start
to finish I was like wow that was very
cogent um anyway so they make the
argument that if there's three people in
a room and I think it went something
along don't quote me on this again three
people in a room and one of them says
I'm in a room and to them say I'm on the
rooms on fire you know you should
probably go with the two people who are
saying hey the rooms on fire and not the
person that is what's relevant
information I guess is the point um now
the defense up on the verge already
Google denies oh and there's there's
like there's like a whole like
Illuminati thing about how Larry Page
funded or owns a company I think that's
true yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean to be
clear I'm not saying loominatee
confirmed like you know mr. peanut on
the american idea illuminati yes it's
this like tech based company that Larry
Page is funding yes hoping that is being
contracted by Hillary's campaign
something to the tune of hundred seven
hundred and seventy seven thousand
dollars in a quarter which sounds like a
lot of money to normal people like you
and me but this is important right now
in the context of Larry Page that means
nothing she probably keeps that amount
of money in every pair of shoes in the
event that he gets
and he needs to you know grab some money
for walking around out of somewhere that
the robber wouldn't have gotten it from
yeah and we're back
Illuminati freaking confirmed you're
waiting on that the whole time race
Hillary Clinton showed up outside the
door of our warehouse walked in with
like armed guards behind her dressed in
black and told us well not us told our
computer yeah you blue screen right now
where we are not walking out of this
place it happened Josh was there okay so
the last thing happened our computer
blue screen I'm not really sure what the
deal was with that something to do with
attempted switch from DPC which is
something to do with maybe a real tech
wireless driver we don't have any real
tech devices in this computer we don't
have any of those that's that's for sure
so let's get back into into what I was
talking about the hell was I talking
about before okay um so right ah
medium/dark okay so the verge has the
verge has a good follow-up that
basically says google denies altering
search suggestions for hillary clinton
and points out that some of the examples
that SourceFed sites for example hillary
clinton CRI doesn't come up with crime
in fact apply across the board google
avoids auto completing the word crime or
criminal so that they can avoid making
disparaging comments about people who
may not have actually committed a crime
there may not be a criminal in fact they
do so they've pointed this out this is
who's this guy matt cutts is the
currently on leave from his position as
head of Google's webspam team Sayed so
they do this for everyone else including
people that have actually been charged
and convicted very interesting he also
points out that those looking for
negative stories don't necessarily type
Hillary's last
name they actually mostly search
apparently for I don't know Larry hi
early know why he would know this if
he's on leave might still well you might
still know enough about the inner
workings to come up with some examples
that demonstrate the opposite okay the
first part totally the the part where
they're all looking for Hillary not
Hillary Clinton is like well you can
look for that though like you can search
for relevance like you can search for
yes they did people were searching for
that so basically oh and so another
thing they pointed out is that many
results pop in when you type in Donald
Trump racist but results also appear for
Hillary Clinton racist um so there you
go so basically the conclusion in The
Verge article here is they're likely
trying to walk the line between
providing as much information as they
can and not stepping into a sort of gray
legal area by say suggesting that
someone could be a criminal so here's a
state spokespersons full statement on
the matter Google autocomplete does not
favor any candidate or cause claims to
the contrary simply misunderstand how
Donald Trump RAC yeah it comes with with
Donald Trump racist if you type Hillary
Clinton are a see it comes with Rachel
race issue Rachel Maddow race 2016
that's interesting I wonder if that is a
regional thing as well yeah Donald Trump
RAC racist SNL racist commercial racist
articles racist rally it's all racist
I don't know that racism is necessarily
a hot-button topic for Hillary I doubt
it I'm just saying that was said in
there yeah that's very interesting seem
true so here hold on we should we should
probably do the demo live if we're going
to if we're gonna talk about this I
don't even necessarily know it because
like so there you have it so racist
costume is my Sikh fifth fifth
suggestion all right mine only goes down
to four like I'm actually on Google's
website to you're doing the
browser suggestions okay so there you go
oh okay so no no yeah so that's a
browser thing yeah cuz I'm in Firefox
here in Chrome oh yeah okay there you go
so age email young news news Twitter
wife Donald Glover a little bit news
Twitter wife Net Worth so there's
nothing particularly incriminating there
but it looks like as you continue to dig
in and find examples you can find stuff
that appears to be a bit of an issue so
there is an article over on medium.com
that appears to have been done without
help from Google so here we go search
trends are significant factor in how
autocomplete works is the entire basis
for sourcefed's claim and yet according
to their logic Google must be favoring
Donald Trump as well because they've got
Donald Trump are a completely leaves out
the quite common search term Donald
Trump rape which was the whole alleged
thing with Ivana Trump where she
eventually took back the statement but
she claimed that he raped her so I guess
I didn't follow that yeah so Donald
Trump la okay so we've got Donald Trump
lawsuits and Donald Trump laughing what
is it come with ladies ladies latest
last night laughing so at this point
you're probably thinking this is a great
point at this point you're probably
thinking to yourself whoa you're just
choosing random words and searching them
and he's like yeah that's right I'm
doing exactly totally makes sense
yeah which does make sense so I can
definitely see how SourceFed came to the
conclusion they did because you right
there sitting there we're like well hold
on a second what about this this
conflicts with that remembering that
we're in a different region and I know
that Google does specifically target
suggestions region by region so outside
of America you might get very very
different types of suggestions to do
with any of the presidential candidates
versus someone who's actually in the
u.s. so do I believe that Google is one
hundred percent ethical no do I believe
that they would be stupid and I'll be a
targeted thing to do something that's
blatant right no I I think this would be
really dumb I also have a really hard
time believing that Hillary Clinton is
necessarily the candidate that like
Google as a whole would have decided is
like ideal so seems better than Trump
I guess that's such a yeah that's a can
of worms actually this is interesting I
had sort of changing topics I had dinner
at Computex with like a self-professed
like diehard Trump supporter and
basically the conversation went
something along the lines of were like
where's the tech talk this is tech by
the way just saying the Google yeah the
Google stuff and what I'm telling you
about right now was a conversation I had
at Computex tech is right in there so
basically he he like it's just out of
absolutely nowhere we were talking about
something to do with AMD's strategy for
fire pro cards and distribution channels
or something like italy tech
conversation and then he goes something
something something you know my boy
donald something something something and
and then he's like well and we were like
okay so you're a trump supporter like as
if it was not obvious at that point and
he goes yeah you know blah blah blah
blah blah of course I am and why what
are you Canadian he's like oh you're
socialists then like you know what a not
necessarily yeah for one thing and be
who cares because at a business dinner
the last thing that I'm gonna be talking
about is socialism for Donald Trump that
is like completely inappropriate so so
yeah but hey he's not afraid to speak
his mind
just like his boy Donald um
however inappropriate or appropriate it
might be weren't we supposed to be
talking about the 4k ready PlayStation I
think he's saved no I think we stopped I
think we were done no no we never made
it past the headline we talked about e3
and go because because I saw this over
here and I realized it wasn't on the dog
yeah we never got I'm going through what
we did talk about we talk yeah we talked
about going to e3 and why we don't
anymore yeah so we said it won't be at
e3 which is in the headline yeah and
then we're like we won't be at e3 hi
there yeah okay so let's talk about the
PlayStation 4 console upgrade to be
clear and there doesn't seem to be any
indication that this is an upgrade in
the sense that you can upgrade your
existing console it looks like there
will be an upgrade EDD PlayStation 4
that will include a faster processor 4k
resolutions were all on there I got such
a kick out of the endless endless
PlayStation fan boys back at the time of
launch that were like yeah 4k supports
coming actually it's not actually it
isn't because oh because actually the
HDMI port on the PlayStation not gonna
output it so pay for so there's that um
yeah so technically we're sport is
coming to place yes if you buy a
completely new device that's not yours
I'll offer 4k resolution support and
improved graphics presumably it will
also have support for PlayStation VR
although I don't know if PlayStation VR
is going to be supported on the existing
PlayStation 4 do you know that no I
don't know this mmm that has been an
interesting I don't know if that's a
known thing
yeah I actually I actually don't know so
$500 has been a display the blah blah
blah blah blah blah upcoming virtual
reality headset for the ps4 console but
what's interesting is that the only
confirmation that we have is that there
will be an upgraded ps4 they're not
actually calling it something else yeah
so if they said psvr is for the
PlayStation 4 I mean if this is like a
man because there has been some
confusing stuff that's gone on in
console generations before you know mini
versions and you know cooler running
versions and the Halo versions and all
kinds of different different stuff that
actually in some cases can have very
different hardware and software
limitations I mean early PlayStation 3
he's had backwards compatibility with
hardware it's all Linux on them they're
actually still really cool and then that
completely got kicked those things are
worth money on eBay they are because you
can make them computers like there's a
like a military data center or server or
something that's PlayStation 3 I think
it's like defunct now I'm sure but okay
it was a thing wasn't there I mean um
might have just been experimental that's
also variables anyway the console will
be priced higher than the current three
hundred and fifty dollars for the
existing ps4 and it will be better so
there you go and speaking of things that
will be better all of our talking points
for Squarespace yeah
so we are no longer allowed to say you
should or build it beautiful so we need
a moment of silence yep
Squarespace offers 24/7 support via live
chat and email
they feature responsive design on all of
their website templates which means

there I fix it is probably the sponsor
who actually sponsors the show that I
get accused of like like discreetly
working in product placements for more
often than any other because I
legitimately use our eye fix-it stuff
all the time ifixit.com is your complete
DIY electronics repair solution for
there yeah over there that's why I said
he's going over there now from there
19,000 free step-by-step repair guides
to their huge inventory of replacement
parts and tools we've used iFixit stuff
for everything from screwdrivers for
taking stuff apart to suction cups for
taking stuff apart - well like more
better screwdrivers for taking stuff
apart - lots of different bits for the
screws these are actually this is like
an old kit - but we've got like tons of
IP it's funny the old kit is the one we
have here because I took the new one
home it's got more driver bits it's got
what I was looking for yeah better
sputters it's going with the wrong more
suction cups it's just generally like
super awesome
I'll we've ordered replacement parts
from them for putting the iMac the 5k
iMac that I reviewed back together after
I opened it up in order to take it apart
for some reason why did I think that was
a good idea anyway I took it apart and
put it back together and all their tools
are backed by I fix its lifetime
warranty the pro tect toolkit the good
one that I can't show you because it's
at home is 69.95 and the best part is
you can get ten bucks off
No ah my talking points are wrong five
bucks off on a purchase of $10 or more
my talking points are exactly correct I
just saw the 10 and I jumped the gun
there speaking of jumping the gun I have
a link to the coolermaster store here
that I am supposed to follow ah yes my
friends so cm store - usa.com has all
kinds of interesting stuff
everything from Coolermaster and
basically yes everything from
coolermaster was free for modular stuff
it's fine like if you saw the cooler
master video from Computex you would
have seen some of these things already
so those things are made by primo chill
actually yeah so these are a little like
you can change the look of the front of
your case and the power supply basement
area to this like crazy blue thing if
that's not your style there's a bunch of
other stuff you can do you can get
official stuff from Coolermaster - which
includes like the this crazy handle on
the top of the case this actually ties
in really well to the thing
I was criticizing about a Seuss's
concept PC that they had at the show
that that one that all assembles with
hard PCBs and the problem is that they
were like oh yeah we'll have like
modular upgrades for rear i/o so that an
older motherboard could have like USB
type-c and you would just have this
module that you slot in and I was like
well by the time the distributor and the
retailer and the shipper remember you
have to get it to a distributor then to
a retailer then to the customer I'll
take their cut these things are gonna be
inordinately expensive you might as well
just buy any motherboard I need a
controller for that - um the controller
is actually in the like upgrade module
yeah so so okay so the product manager
for the claims it wasn't but I was like
yes sure um so Coolermaster by stocking
because that's been a big problem for
cases - I bought a windowed side panel
for an antic p160
so that was 12 years ago anyway so I did
that it took like five weeks to special
order because there was like one in the
entire country and that's the way it was
then and that's the way it is today when
it comes to accessories for computer
cases because you just can't stock
enough of them in all the right
distribution areas in order to have
timely fulfillment of those orders be
possible and that was a windowed side
panel I mean relatively common thing
we're not talking like like a freaking
you know like slashed like front panel
thing so I actually see cooling masters
Coolermaster store as an interesting
solution to that problem because clear
mastery themselves handling this doesn't
have to stock a ton of them yeah they
can just say okay step 5 does it is they
buy the things from the makers and then
resell them do which is pretty cool so
you know that like whoo and master is
tracking their stock and like all this
other kind of stuff which actually makes
sense so I think it's pretty cool so the
other thing we're supposed to mention I
guess is the the master case maker 5 so
make it what you will
I know Luke you especially had a lot of
skeptics
in your brain and in your heart and
probably in your pants about cooler
masters hole maker branding and there
are still some products we're still
doing a cooler master sponsor spot but
I'm not afraid to criticize them during
a sponsor spot there are still some
cooler master products that I look at
the maker branding and I just go what
exactly is maker about this but I've got
to give them the vision for the case at
CES they announced that they were gonna
have this store here we are six months
later they have products in it so they
are working on it they are trying to
make it actually like maker in some way
yes I don't understand how like
beautiful honestly looking power supply
happens to be maker but I do appreciate
that they did follow up on the store
thing I like it probably would have
helped if I said in the original video
but the first time I covered their free
for modular system stuff yeah was last
combi Jack's not the most recent one and
I gave them like a year or whatever and
I talked to you about it not that long
ago yeah like where is that where is
that store thing because it's not here
yet
and then it showed up like three weeks
or a month before I meet X or something
I was like okay alright you made it not
by much but you made it but we'll give
you that one Coolermaster you made it
get it they maker it beautiful alright
let's talk about beautiful community
interaction the original article here is
from Engadget riot used League of
Legends chat logs to spot bad staff
apparently looking closely at what
employees say online it's a good thing I
don't do that or IDI probably wouldn't
have a job anymore
haha so Riot Games looked at employees
chat logs and found a correlation
between their behavior in and out of
game they worked with Google's work
staff analytics team and picked through
the last twelve months of each staffers
League of Legends gameplay records and
chat logs they found that a quarter of
the people they had fired in the last
year so they had fired prior to knowing
had shown unusually high
levels of toxic behavior in game armed
with this information riot used it to
proactively address the problem with
remaining staff so they singled out 30
employees all of whom were actually
fairly new to the company and gave them
two options those who got a stern
warning and those who should be let go
and then during the meetings many
employees expressed regret at how they
behaved in-game they received essays
from employees vowing to change their
ways and the report ended with riots
intention to request League of Legends
user names from all future hires for
similar analysis so yeah like social
media investigation by potential and
current employers just got real very
very real like I wouldn't be and you
know what it's it's funny because if
you'd asked me yesterday what is social
media I would have said on Twitter
Facebook YouTube and a lot of people
don't even think of YouTube I only think
of it because YouTube is my primary
social platform okay a lot of people
watch a video I mean what percentage
leave a comment under the video it feels
more like a TV viewing thing yes instead
of a intercommunication thing like yes
but it absolutely is a social media
platform I would not have said the game
I played last Saturday night so let's
get a strawpoll going on here like oh
straw poll is what riot did okay
and I'm not putting in turnip because
I've this is like the requesting kind of
a big deal here's your names seems a
little weird for future employees okay
so before we before we get into the
answer to that question um let me say
this when I applied at NCIX
I actually went out of my way to include
my form username yeah thank you my
posting history on their site I'm not
gonna say who but certain people on like
the forum and certain people that I know
through twitch and stuff
yeah I've included their handles for the
line of SEC tips for them for certain
jobs that they have gotten and that has
been part of it so I race from other
jobs yeah I actually do totally does one
of them have the initial CC fairly
prominent member real initials oh okay
I'm just I'm oddly curious yeah yeah no
problem telling you okay um and like
it's worked and it's helped them and I
understand the voluntary giving of those
things yeah and like having right be
like it's a good thing if you give us
your username is probably I just I think
it's because they aren't there certain
legal requirements you can spin it both
I sincerely doubt a gamer handle is even
covered but I could see Riley spinning
it both ways because they could spin it
to every candidate this way if you give
us your League of Legends username it
enables us to help you the good
candidate get a job mm-hmm but the
implication the implied backside of that
story is that it helps weed out
potential jackasses during the interview
process so so some questions that you
can't ask is what is your religious
affiliation are you pregnant
what is your political affiliation what
is your race color or ethnicity although
if you're in an interview
anyways sometimes it's not obvious sure
most people think my wife is I think I
get a lot of people saying she might be
Filipina which is not sure um that's a
good point
how old are you are you disabled are you
married do you have children or plan to
are you in debt do you some drink or
smoke socially socially I guess so in
social so in that sense if riot asks for
your username they they could very
indirectly get the answer to like
everything there they could get the
answers to pretty much all of that
especially because that probably
includes whispers what if it doesn't
know let's say it doesn't let's assume
let's assume let's let's give the
benefit of the doubt let's say it
doesn't include whispers right okay so
let's say it only includes public chat
but by the time you post that
information on a public server have you
yeah have you have you put on your
forehead employ know because there's
also implied anonymity mm-hmm through
your username
you're not playing eyes - Sebastian
right you're playing as whatever I do
because I give up but sure yeah but like
okay you know what I mean yeah I don't
actually use my but yeah like I don't
know okay so let's let's hear from the
viewers
this is splint pretty much right down
the middle yes all right we've got 53%
of you saying it's okay
riot has the right to know what you and
you know it might be in there EULA
somewhere riot has the right to know
before you work for them that's our
neighbor what you posted on there
privately owned servers which is an
interesting point riot probably has
terms in there EULA that entitle them to
ownership of everything that gets posted
in much the same way that Linus tech
tips mom owns anything you post on it
sure do the end-user license doesn't
have to do with you forfeiting the
information of you using it right but
you knowingly and willingly posted that
with maybe you figured you were
anonymous
but you weren't according to the
end-user license agreement you willingly
and knowingly posted that publicly yeah
yeah but so it's still it's still not
forfeiting a username because you could
falsify your personal data that's true
signing up but if the EULA says you're
not allowed to do that
you let's also don't hold up like ever
that's true they don't but if Riots
company policy is that all employees
subject to termination if they fail to
comply need to follow the EULA but can
you can you go around let's say if there
was I'm going into three articles here
yeah if that list of stuff that I just
said included gamertag for whatever
reason would circumventing that by
saying that they have to follow the u
that is that legal I guess John and I
don't think it comes down to legality or
not legality because ultimately you can
you can control what an employee posts
on your privately owned servers as a
company yeah it's not about control
though this is reading the last 12
months right so going back yeah I'm
looking at it well ultimate because
there could be a code of conduct within
the company where you I'll have to act
this certain way
yeah like Costco has a code of ethics
yeah they have like an entire handbook
it's like this thick it's like here's
you know here's the value up to which
you can accept a dinner from someone
here's this that that that that and that
you know you know what's funny is I have
actually kind of talked myself into it
you're also an employer no but even
outside of that because while I cuz
we've talked about this before yeah and
I don't remember what stance I took but
you know whatever
you have to give some insight we have
but did you have changed opinions but
but added information to what we thought
about a person that was going through an
interview process with us by looking at
their social media yes Oh long time ago
you were in on that did I bless who is
their Twitter
yeah okay okay this is a long time ago
did they gather III think the Twitter
account was was given to us okay so it
was given to us yeah okay
but we clearly have no problem looking
at social media for things now with that
said I personally don't really like this
the reason why I don't really like this
is because of the implied anonymity of
your username if you post something on
Twitter or to a public Facebook account
that is very searchable and is directly
attached to your name I think of course
that's searchable you by your employer I
don't think you have to forfeit those
accounts but they're under your name and
are searchable so whatever so I don't
like the idea of creeping something that
wasn't provided yeah especially if it's
a third party so if riot was saying you
have to provide your Facebook username
because I've heard of employers
demanding this you have to you have to
you know what's your Facebook yeah and
we intend to look at it like if they
demanded that that's one thing and that
to me is actually very different from
demanding to know what potential
employees or current employees because
they only did this for current employees
and then the potential employees is
moving forward now so they did this for
critters ways yeah what your current
employees are posting on a server you oh
yeah I was just gonna say that's also a
different thing because it's their
platform and I could definitely see this
might change my opinion a little bit
because it's their platform that's like
how they are treading on your turf yeah
it's how they are representing your
brand I was applying this to like any
gamertag rank so like if you played wow
and legal engines they would want to
have both of them yeah but that's maybe
I don't know I know because they
wouldn't have the ability to do that
anyway right so but I think that would
be more wrong anyway yeah I think so too
I think what an employer having on your
turf wanting to know your stuff for your
own servers I actually totally see that
the if someone wanted to apply to work
here and we're on the forum I would want
to know
their account was yeah I would want to
see how they conducted me yes in the
forum
I wouldn't ask for their other accounts
so I actually I guess I do agree with it
I just don't agree with it as a gamertag
in general a gamertag in general feels
like it should just be this is my
escapism land yeah that's what I was
trying to defend it's your anonymous
area you should just you role play role
playing is a thing how I behave as a
gamertag shouldn't necessarily be the
be-all and end-all of someone how how
how someone interprets Who I am and what
I am as a person but I also see where
riots coming from which is if you're
role-playing an asshole to the community
of our paying customers who you're
trying to apply for and will be
representing in some way or another yeah
viewers ultimately serving at you're
like freakin beige right is gonna want
someone who like compared to a negative
person they would want someone who's
trying to make the community better
yeah because that's the exact same kind
of deal as the person in the interview
who is actively trying to find ways and
offer up ways that they could improve
the company and who have pre thought
about these things like like the
standard thing like if you're applying
for a social media position be like oh I
have these ideas for improving your
social media situation because I've
already looked at what you're doing and
analyze what you're doing and thought
about it and try these practices and
whatnot that's a very good thing to
bring to that interview bring to that
interview that you obviously didn't care
and are contributing to a toxic
environment is not in twitchplayspokemon
says someone was role-playing at me real
hard in an overwatch match I played last
night we're not saying that role-playing
an asshole is okay we're just saying
that I think we specifically didn't yeah
it might not necessarily be who you are
the person yeah okay Team Viewer
confirms number of abuse user accounts
is significant
oh so original article here is from
bleeping a computer calm they apologized
but they still
say they were not compromised which is
something that has yet to be actually
proven even though redditors and some
blogs out there have offered up some
evidence that looks fairly compelling to
suggest that they were indeed
compromised so what well they were
definitely compromised the whether or
not Team Viewer was compromised like
their records that's their compromised
yeah but TeamViewer accounts were
definitely come we're definitely
compromised so the suggested course of
action it right now is to protect your
accounts with secure passwords that are
frequently changed have reliable
anti-malware and security solutions in
place at all times and enable two-factor
authentication that's what TeamViewer is
suggesting there's other stuff that you
can do the way that I was once
compromised well not not me personally
I've never been compromised not
compromising the way the Linus tech tips
channel was compromised was through a
keylogger where I did not have to factor
authentication enabled because remember
it was available yet I doubt it was back
then it was a long time ago anyway so
through a keylogger
so one of the other ways that you can
avoid getting your password sniped by a
keylogger is by having something like a
password keeper like LastPass something
that people are questioning is they're
saying I had a 2-step enable then they
still got in we don't have any
confirmations of these things but
hearing that is bad one one thing that
I'm gonna say is not to bring this up
again but quite a while ago we had a
breach on the last tech tips forum which
super mega sucked and even if that
wasn't our fault you still have to kind
of be a little more proactive you should
probably considering this as an exploit
that's going against your software sure
their breach isn't your fault but it's
still an exploit that is widely
significantly going against your
software you should probably inform your
use
yep that this could be a problem ingest
passwords actively through into email
suggest to step they have my email
address one thing they can't be just
like busted our email reputation by
making sure that we hammered emails out
as fast as we could to all of our users
to let you actually hurt us in the
longer term no one from hot no man at
Microsoft domain got an email from us
for months for a very long time
including password reset emails yeah
which was a nightmare thanks Microsoft
we were just trying to help people and
then they ignored us for months with
trying to get anyway so pretty much the
way the attack works is people are
breaking into your TeamViewer into your
computer with TeamViewer
and then they are using presumably saved
passwords on your computer please don't
do that for example if you have a
password keeper I don't understand why
this isn't a default option but actually
while you're in your next security audit
can you run around and make sure
everyone has it set to timeout after a
very short period of time make sure your
password keeper times out like for the
love of everything that is valuable to
you time out your password keeper
through the whole point so what they're
doing is they're going into whether it's
you're using Chrome to save your
passwords which by the way is really
stupid or Firefox save your passwords
which by the way is even super stupider
because it seems it's in plain text in a
file in like data roaming local whatever
it is
what was I yeah so then they're using
your safe passwords to drain your bank
account and your paypal which there's
not a whole lot that anyone can do about
once it's done if the action was
effectively done by you um right we've
got a lot of topics left some of which I
like really did want to talk about real
quick here where'd it go to do to to to
to to to to to what where did it go
you know I had something I really wanted
to do like what I didn't - the
TeamViewer one I had like a segue and
everything and it's completely not in my
mind anymore this no no it was cool this
no that's cool too but not not as cool
um oh well oh this no yeah no I know I
was like something else like it might
not have actually oh this is a doc oh
yeah
wait no no this oh this apparently got
rejected I don't know I don't know why
why did that get rejected
um I don't know I actually don't know
blah blah blah um oh okay well I don't
know why it was rejected so I'm not
gonna go too far into it but twitch
troll donates $50,000 to streamers
PayPal allegedly refuses to refund maybe
we don't actually have confirmation on
whether PayPal is refunding it or not uh
yeah okay Nick Nick is Nick is filling
it in for me conflicting reports okay so
I was gonna try and tie that in well I
think that pretty much wraps it up for
the land show I do want to do a call out
for aired sports guys if you haven't
already check it out over on vessel they
offer a seven day free trial
they offer a seven day free trial where
you can see - tech tips tech quickie and

other creators and it should also be
noted that nerd sports all five episodes
of which are up there and for whatever
reason not particularly searchable there
it is all five of which are watchable
curling ice hockey dodgeball lacrosse
and volleyball where we the keyboard
warriors take on real athletes in the
sports of their choosing curly one was
