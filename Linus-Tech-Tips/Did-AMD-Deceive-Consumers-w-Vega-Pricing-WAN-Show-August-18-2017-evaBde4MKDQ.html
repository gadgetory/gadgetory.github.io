you guys may or may not have noticed
there's something a little different
about the show today I know what it is
I'm screen-sharing off a Mac I'm using a
Mac oh no that's it isn't it unsub I
know right um so yeah we've got a couple
special guests we've got James $0.02
from the YouTube channel Jay's $0.02
there's pretty much no way you guys
don't know who he is and then we've got
Dimitri from Hardware connects who a lot
of you will probably know who he is as
well so we've got a lot of great topics
for you guys today
what are they oh yeah in unexpected news
andis Vega graphics cards are more
expensive than MSRP oh my god we saw
that coming more Vega news oh wait I've
got okay you guys are all being
sarcastic which is kind of addictive
okay it's not a sarcastic show no okay
there's not this is a forthright and
clear communicative shell command
dependences in other news Intel claims
that the 8700 K will be about 11 percent
faster than the 7700 K cool can we just
not say anything if we're gonna be nice
okay know what if you guys aren't gonna
like guys aren't going to do the show
nicely then you can just go actually no
what no I'm just gonna go okay okay well
after that we have probably more Intel
shows over oh this is the end this is
the end of everything the end of days
okay you are the weakest link goodbye
goodbye you all we're just
what I was looking for it neither was
found after that the bullet that was in
like one of your main compartment to
your back
neither was behind it we were both
looking for yeah good job Nick magic
ain't magic hey is holiday sonali oops I
clicked the wrong thing
uh okay back on the Oh Oh No terrible
everything's terrible what are you doing
hold on hold on I got this okay there
one sponsors there we go don't worry
about it don't worry about the nascar
hat there's reasons that will reveal
that another time yeah it has nothing to
do with scrapyard Wars or their close
toed shoes yeah nothing these guys are
here also has yes nothing we've got you
and where when show and when show only
okay so actually I think that's probably
a great topic for us to start with guys
get amped about the upcoming season of
scrapyard ours it's probably not going
to be out for like six weeks to eight
weeks like I'm talking first episode but
it's our Christmas present to you and
Brad will play and it'll be out first on
floatplane by that times victories by
that time floatplane nope let's not go
with that
well plane might not even exist anymore
for all we know who know um
but what I will say you know there's
going to be no spoilers on the show
today you guys but what I will say is a
huge thank you to Jay and Dimitri for
flying all the way up here pleasure was
all ours
yes thank you for these like cool I'm
yeah it was like we had a lot of fun so
that's that's the only spoiler I'll give
you guys is it was a ton of fun and yeah
you know what that's it that's it so and
now radio silence and don't even bother
trying to get anything out of these guys
because they know the scrapyard Wars
code yeah say something and I I mean
it's more like um what is it a say on
things say and AI day
you know we'll go with the pig latin
version of the code but yeah I just like
that we left it worried to death didn't
show um alright so guys first first
article today this was posted by stay us
on the forum and the original article
here how do I click a link on a Mac what
the hell is this
yes okay yeah uh yeah you know boys okay
I just want to know it works don't
discuss religion through the hardest
pressure Oh what why fresh I no pressure
to tell and then i go i go to i go to
use the touch screen to zoom and it's
like no you'll have to do
ah about my computer back okay anyway
anyway AI be partners to gamers nexus is
was posted by Seberg st right yeah you
know Steven yeah okay ah give Oh was
right about AMD price changing plug is
here AMD basically came out of the game
with Vega 56 and Vega 64 with and I
think you guys in your reviews probably
agreed mega64 looks okay other than
being a couple years late because it's
basically an overclock so 980ti and Vega
56 looks pretty good it's the $400 King
I'll return your computer new it okay so
now it looks like launch price at Vega
64 was supposed to be $500 but quickly
shot to six hundred US dollars in the
wake of immediate inventory selling out
so is this actual MSRP and or is this
just stores reacting I'm going with the
letter yeah yeah is we can't really
blame them for that so this is
interesting
apparently a website that AMD provided
the top retailers and e-tailers with a
$4.99 price on Vega 64 coupling sale of
a card with a rebate to reduce spend by
retailers so basically that's like it's
usually called like a POS rebate
point-of-sale rebate apparently the
rebate is already expiring hence the
price jumped by retailers
Oh was that fast yeah well see this is
something that is kind of not public
knowledge this is more and I'm sure I'm
over like the statute of limitations for
my old job as a product manager but it
is it is pretty tight to be an AMG
partner I've gotten a lot of feedback in
the industry over the years being an
Nvidia add-in card partner I think they
call them a IV's and I think AMD calls
them a ICS adding card versus at inboard
Road being an Nvidia partner versus an
AMD partner is supposedly a lot better
now XFX you guys probably remember this
oh yeah
when did they jump ship Oh Indy yeah but
wasn't like 4000 years six six thousands
of sorry odd 6000 series name oh no no
it was 4000 series I think you're right
so it was like so that was when AMD
looked because they were competing
against um was that 480 generation or
had they just G was out then put it they
just haven't refreshed in forever
basically they turn tail on Nvidia and
they went to AMD and my understanding is
that it's been pretty rough over there
is is all I can all I can really say but
what are your guys have thoughts on the
pricing of Vega 64 in particular looks
like here having effectively been
increased I think it's only beneficial
for those who are using the computer
formance honestly not as a gaming card
right because at that point it makes no
sense that you're talking today DTI
pricing which dominates it in games
but at the exact same time not not in
terms of making sense but AMD right now
has a very aggressive very dedicated fan
base it's true so it might not even
matter
my concern of this though was that that
fan base is usually though attached to
the performance per dollar aspect of
being a named exam and yeah but AMD has
put a lot of work into making it a
rebellious stance instead of just
necessarily a performance for daleks
because they were definitely performance
per dollar like with the 3000 series
Intel processors and like a couple
generations that were like 200 series
AMD graphics cards but more recently I
feel like they've been shifting it I
think the bigger question you'll hear
though I think the bigger question here
the one that effects our audience and
the one that affects us as reviewers
more is this artificial rebate that's
only valid for I mean the card only
launched what a week ago so a rebate
that they're putting on the card for a
week to hit a price that isn't
sustainable is that effect write your
conclusion about the card of your and
it's not like especially as youtubers
it's not like we can go back and edit
our article be like yeah the price to
performance sucks donkey balls and not
not to flatter ourselves but that's
where a lot of research is happening
right now is YouTube especially for
people that are getting new into
computers and might not think to check a
whole bunch of different sites like
written sites that can be updated like
gamers Nexus guy we just talked about
him he might say in his video pricing
and stuff is in is on our website i've
seen him say that before so that they
can update it but not in them but like
for something like a like a $4.99 Yuling
changes yeah like a like a budget
graphics card where they're going like
we're the were the new $4.99 guard 399
King 399 King and then if we if our
conclusion is check the link in the
description for prices for the most of
them advancing on Amazon but we say yeah
AMD's positioned this card really well
it's performance looks great and the
value is great if it's a if it's 80 or
$100 more extensive I feel like what
they've done is they've made Nvidia feel
like a more compelling deal or
at that point I mean because 1070 right
competes against 56 and 56 was beating
1070 pretty much across the board but
now you increase that price why would I
want 56 unless I'm going compute I mean
if I can use the compute aspect of it
then yeah it dominates both of them
dominate what NVIDIA has to offer
but the question is how many of these
buyers are actually buying them for
compute or to be a part of that
rebellion nation you know also
will this affect any of the bundle stuff
that baby is and what happening out
right yeah and we have to sow the
bundles would have to go 500 yeah I feel
like yeah the bundles would just go up
and I don't think anything else would
change I don't think the bundles are
going to get anything the bundles were a
terrible idea to begin with
I just really don't like being screwed
around with like this yeah I don't like
being manipulated in a way where like
there's a couple things and you know
what it's one of those things where I'm
not just going to crap on AMD for this
like you and I talked about this offline
I think I might have mentioned it to you
but I was really really displeased when
Nvidia had a separate processing embargo
for the 1080 Ti because you know what
that is that's Nvidia saying max you
need some help over there no what are we
changing I don't know okay I gotta focus
now I really would have just maybe left
it also point it towards Linus a little
bit more that's a bit okay okay let's
just let's not have to take part okay um
thanks medics okay what are we talking
about again your time at the unboxing
right okay so there were a couple things
wrong with that number one was that Paul
had already done an unboxing at the
event and that's nothing against why not
super cool but I think I applaud
attraction that that sort of got and the
problem up with the idea of like oh we
better reel this in and you know put an
embargo on this because what they're
trying to get because that effectively
what they're getting when they do a
launch event we all accept it because it
gives us access to talk to the
developers of the product right in a way
that we don't get to on just a lot more
helpful than a conference call yeah so
so we all accept these events that they
do because it's also an opportunity to
network within the industry most of the
time
with you guys it has has been advent
industry events but what's really
frustrating is that Nvidia controls the
narrative at that point because any news
story and we have to do a news story
because everybody else is going to do a
new rotary so that's my upload that day
that's Jai's upload that day that's to
make sure you upload that day that's
other content that might be more
meaningful because it's not just
regurgitating the same information
everybody has that isn't going up
because we're busy traveling for a day
yeah spending a day at an event and then
traveling back for another day we just
spent 1% of our year on this event to
make the same piece of content that
everybody else is making for me
personally and there's ok they're not
emn yeah there can be some value to that
because people might have different
opinions or insights or ideas about how
something might be used well Baba but
it's a lot it's a lot to put on one item
and when you have to do just an unboxing
it's a it's pretty unlikely that you'll
have a lot of unique insights well not
even I need to be just kind of off topic
a little bit but then it goes as far as
starting to break down the information
like you can get this piece of
information we get this piece later this
piece tomorrow right the pricing issue
that happens 1080i which was a huge
issue yeah
so what this looks like to me because
Nvidia is effectively getting marketing
out of bringing people to this event
they're just regurgitating whatever was
on Nvidia slides because that's all the
information we have so far we don't have
any benchmarks like how fast is the the
öberg card ten thousand or whatever so
then there's that date let's say let's
say March first for the sake of argument
then March 14th would be the review
embargo typically or yeah like they ever
give us to video yeah maybe like March
it would be the review embargo that
gives us a week to get back home test it
formulate our opinions and go okay that
thing we talked about a week ago here's
the real skinny now they're putting this
additional day a few days later where
they're going okay now you can publish
your unboxing here's the problem with
that the unboxing contains no
information that's new yeah and
especially when it's time in retail
packaging yeah there's a right physical
showcase
it's the glamour video yeah I think they
should be paying for that because
effectively what they're getting is
marketing
so when Nvidia sent us an embargo for an
unboxing of the 1080p eye I basically
sent them back an angry email went this
is BS you guys are asking for free
advertising no you know Nvidia no hard
no right yeah
so Anton pulled the same thing with red
gripper on the CPU side and then on the
GPU side
honestly this feels even worse in some
way because instead of instead of asking
for free marketing what they've done is
they've manipulated the conclusions of
what it's supposed to be an independent
evaluation yeah I mean like you said
it's so close to the launch date that's
I mean our reviews are still not even
cooled off yet and I have that whole the
whole budget factor of it is just wrong
and like I'm sure one maybe two guys
will make a video about that right yeah
but there's only enough space for that
because honestly most people the
audience won't really care they won't
care in terms of like oh I'm going to
watch all of these videos because I'm
not interested you know what I mean now
so then it's the the ROI on making one
of those isn't really there for the
creators so then they're probably not
going to make it yeah is the rebate
information available to to the
reviewers until a certain point I didn't
know anything about no rebate yeah I
didn't know anything about it and I
didn't know that it was going to be
expiring after a week yeah if they had
been upfront about that then this is a
totally different conversation and
that's and that's not even that it
doesn't even mention the fact that they
only launched with Bendel's
to begin with anyway yeah really hard to
find a card by yourself the bundles were
the only thing you could find all of
your tailors are doing bundles yep and I
mean like if we want to keep going on
about grievances with the RX Vega launch
you know when did you get your Vega 66
Friday before the lunch yeah so we got
it Friday morning before what was it a
Monday 6 a.m. launch you know so if
anyone from AMD is watching imma break
this down for you Saturday and Sunday
are both considered we
ken's and it is fairly typical for
people who have a life for a family or
both I don't know if anyone has those or
not can you have a life and a family ok
whatever not the point the point the
point is that those two days are weekend
days which are generally considered the
days that you spend having a life or
having a family right so then we have to
make the choice right so I have to tell
my wife and my kids last minute like hey
I've got to work all day Saturday oh and
by the way I'm going to be leaving for a
whole week right after that you know so
I live the whole whole Saturday with
them yeah
and literally that was we just added a
whole six workday to the week room just
to handle that well you could just you
could just wait and you could you could
just publish so here's the thing we had
mega64 like a week before and we had the
drivers and everything and we were told
that Megha 56 was going to be coming was
going to be lifted way later like quite
a bit later so we weren't so we were
like we were like yeah everything's fine
and then a card literally arrived here
Friday morning when I get 52nd I was
like what are we supposed to do with a
message asking to prioritize it did they
for you yeah
oh I don't I think we didn't get that
until like even later in the day
yeah no the message was 56 is coming
please please prioritize it if you can I
got a new driver on the weekend yeah no
you're absent
this is a 6 a.m. Pacific launch time so
you have to be done the night so you
actually have to be rendering your video
by like Sunday evening mm-hmm because
there might be error so many things you
have to correct the render might not
work there might be edit to have to make
because of a problem
Taran's very intimately familiar with
this yeah so well it's kind of like
right before the new CPU platform
launches to write how many BIOS updates
are there like up to the day of your
launch I would be it's really funny
people are joking in the twitch chat
about like YouTube or Union or something
like that here is an interesting thought
Owen directly what if every text guy on
YouTube got together and said no screw
your embargo will go when we're already
I've kind of started doing that Vegas
the first actual embargo date I've hit
in a long time
thread regulating hit rise in 3 5 &amp;amp; 7 I
didn't hit inhale I hate your head go
for like two three days after everybody
publish two or three weeks sometimes
because I'm tired of the situation like
Linus is talking about and when you're
talking about with last minute drivers
and stuff that I just wait for things to
kind of settle and then I'm going to
start making a like review embargo
Alliance yeah review embargo Alive cause
like I we had to pull in we had to pull
in multiple people on a Saturday yeah to
come in basically because the video was
completely done yeah by the time we had
a very fifty-six in our hands yeah yeah
so turns over there informing us that it
was indeed him that edited it all - yeah
so now he is like that didn't get to go
anywhere I have just gotten so sick and
tired of all the last-minute changes in
the way it actually changes the whole
landscape that I've just decided like
I'm no longer going to abide by the
embargo dates trying to hit them if I'm
late that's fine that's my audience is
willing to wait and watch it anyway yeah
but I'm tired of feeling like I'm just
an extension of someone else's marketing
team so tell me this um oh should I
completely lost track of what I was
going to say there bloody hell sorry
it's been a long week it has something
something embargo something embargo
Union yeah I think something etc yeah
forget it I got nothing so uh basically
I'm frustrated it's stupid and had
enough of this crap oh now I'm really
frustrated it was like him it was like a
great discussion thing I was really
looking forward to talking about
something very temporarily while you can
try to talk about that do you want to
talk about what the the premise or the
rules were for the scrap yard work yeah
go ahead
go ahead you know for this car of wars
the idea was instead of starting at the
office and working out of the office the
entire time like we have in the past we
had two teams should we do what the
teens were yeah there are thirty public
okay yeah so it alright that makes sense
so as myself and J and Linus and Dmitry
and we started out actually in the City
of Vancouver which is about an hour from
here and we had a fair amount of cash I
can say how much when fair amount of
cash but some of that cash had to be
allocated to food and water
you had no budget for food you can
by food normally in separate words you
could buy whatever food you wanted while
you're going with your own money but
this time be fair it didn't have to it's
just it's allocated from your budget
yeah nothing you spent anything and your
thing yeah come out of that budget if
you wanted to bike somewhere you'd have
to buy or rent a bike if you wanted to
transit somewhere further out you get a
bus pass or a transit pass of some sort
or get a cab or whatever so yeah it was
a very interesting setup both teams
decided to go at it in certain ways that
I'm not going to describe because I'm
worried about going too deeply into it
but yeah it was very interesting quite a
bit different from any other scratch or
a dream I dream to go I'm just laughing
all the get J water comments because I
think a drink or an empty cup of the
coke I'm trying to make up for all the
water that you know we needed yes yeah
don't spoil it water doesn't spoil so
what no this ah don't they figured out I
say yeah I never figured out what it was
but I had really like just wanted to
talk a little bit more about sort of how
they're handling it and how it's uh
we've had to do it before we've had to
delay videos we've missed embargoes
which are yeah fairly important but we
found not the most important thing and
sometimes it helps if there does happen
to be a change yeah because then we can
talk about the change and that one video
will pick up traction but it's usually
only us or only J or only Demetri or
only one type of creator that's making
that one delayed video and I do wonder
what that what the fallout would be not
really fallout but what would the impact
be if suddenly the entire tech scene on
YouTube just said no we're not going to
hit your embargo we all collectively say
we'll wait two weeks to see where things
land because we'd still be in that
window of AMD pulling this or would they
just post on this I don't know I don't
know how they'd react because I told
them I think you guys should push it I
think they might I think they might
think initially especially something
like in video right they might think
that there's not gonna be any impact
whatsoever but that's been an
interesting metric to see how it
actually plays out I don't think NVIDIA
gives two craps with any of this thing I
think you're right to be perfectly
honest it's really funny because like I
think you take this somewhat
but we take flak all the time for being
an Nvidia socket or someone and there's
some what yeah yeah yeah oh we do when
show is brought to you by Nvidia so yeah
well according to the audience anyway so
like it's it's one of those things where
like you know why but it heads with some
a fair number of times recently more
often than I like go to a nice dinner
and you know talk shop it's been it's
been it's been pretty tough lately
actually
alright so let's have a look at uh we
didn't get Titan XP needed today until
like now yeah we have one now yeah cuz
they were like oh what you guys don't
have one I was like no I asked for one
for Terry Crews and I said no why they
turned me down until I made that video
talk like talking crap about Titan XP
which would have gone out regardless
because I think it's a really stupid
card based on like the way to locking
down the CUDA cores and yeah they're
unlocking it multiple times in the same
generation but it was after that they're
like two of them just showed up right
right so they hand-delivered them yeah
other good not even for me I don't care
right they're not for me and like this
is this is a stupid thing on both the
vendor side and the audience side do you
guys honestly think that Jay can be
bought with a graphics card that doesn't
pay my lease doesn't pay for my
employees my insurance do you need a
graphics card Jay it's pretty obvious I
don't sell them I mean you can see the
shop
you know no they do not run my business
in fact I started buying more stuff than
ever now I've noticed that you were
talking about buying lots of stuff and
off just it's just easier and it's in
general way don't though yeah yeah yeah
and now we go to scrap here at war
experience you can buy more stuff to
what someone else's money which is great
[Laughter]
speaking of someone else's money the
show today is brought to you by cable
Don yeah I've got some stuff over there
yeah okay so cable mod now has sleeving
for a iOS have you guys seen this
this oh I did a great review that was
very well-received oh okay
I didn't watch it I know you didn't have
to watch it either oh so basically you
buy your AIO
and then with no actual modification
required you guys can go watch James
video because we didn't review them um
but they're you know you just kind of
unfold it and then you don't have to
like take off the tubing or anything
like that you just wrap it around and
you end up with that nice sleeved look
on your AIO cooler tubes and matches
your cabling assuming you went and
bought cable mod cabling and that's
pretty much it they've got little
finishing pieces for the end so they
look nice and tidy and what else can i
really say about it i mean it's a pretty
simple idea just today i'm going to do
the colors do specifically match their
cable sleeping so they're perfectly
match for that so they've got lots and
lots of different colors you guys can go
check them out all cool also just
launched their sleeping kits on amazon
so we've got a link in the video
description for that but basically it's
uh hold on a second and can I even
figure out how to do this on a Mac holy
crap camp
you can't right-click it's two finger
click copy you have to like bring it up
it's your finger tap oh it took me well
so I'm not signed in so forget it
the link will be below I'll get it
alright what else we got here oh yes
today's show challenge also brought to
you by G fuel that's right the same G
fuel that we were check out that right
there is concentrated blue energy G fuel
powers the editing of many of our videos
and the writing of most episodes of fast
as possible around here we actually may
consume as an office on ordinated you'll
amount of G fuel yeah so basically how
it works is you choose your fuel select
your drink mix from up from over excuse
me from 18 flavors they ship it directly
to you you just add water so you mix one
serving into a glass or shake your cup
filled with 16 ounces of water and enjoy
it comes in tubs
just like that boxes containing packs or
just the little packs themselves and
then who put this note in here a bunch
of the people here at the office pretty
much live off of his so what John John
for sure I know Colton drinks a lot of
clothes and thanks a lot of it I've seen
a bunch the editing dent I'm not
entirely sure who drinks it in there I'm
not sure
I think Edie does I wouldn't be
surprised at all I'm pretty sure Edie
consumes a copious amounts of it so
there you have it their goal is to
create an alternative to sugar loaded
cannon energy drinks and now you can
have these packets you mix them with
water and bippity bop you're ready to go
so you can say 40% until August 21st
using offer code - at the link that I am
definitely going to put right here right
now over at G fuel calm all right our
last sponsor go team soloed have you
guys tried savage jerky would you know
about it you guys want to try it you
don't have to there's like my sponsor
spot I'm not fighting the address might
be more exact can I get more water dirty
stuff as you're watching yeah you can
get for what I will personally go get me
what I get he's gonna go no I want less
to do it now he said he was not I'll do
it okay I got Linus to get up and leave
his own show to get me water this I win
so we got the Reaper we got the motor
I've been informed this is no ho not
mojo no go well if you're if you're like
into spicy but not an insane amount of
spicy like you don't want your face to
literally melt but you're into spicy I
like Momo I mean if you want you're
eating these because they're like all
almost thinking like you know everyone's
just like oh yeah I'll just like eat
whatever no that's really hot one that's
already hot and Reaper I think is even
hotter yeah Reaper is the crazy one
ghost peppers like pretty damn hot
mohos on these like cocky bitches this
is like a 3 so it's like on spicy and it
will kick Oh God so the Reapers are 5 it
like makes its own level smell ghost
pepper is absolutely okay this one is
just delicious
if you guys just want something tasty
before you melt your taste buds off
resist oh ho oh there's only a one so if
you want to try peace so savage jerky
the jerk you've made with the best
ingredients without night
or preservative Golic we in a snack that
was full of flavor and spice it's not
bad for you they've got 13 different
flavors but my personal favorites are
Moho as well as the maple buffalo bacon
and some of the some of the taste but
melty ones are actually pretty darn yeah
they've got a lotta cheese while your
face milk made of ghost pepper as well
as a Carolina Reapers and you can use
offer cone healthy to save 10% 10% Oh
Bret savage jerky calm all right I will
go get you some water and you go ahead
and pick one of those if you want I'm
not gonna make you do it though cuz
there I think my girlfriend would die
savages right in the name
oh really this isn't why I see okay you
got giant Pink's in there I think you'll
be good I love habanero yeah I think
you'll be good yeah
why because if you would if you don't
like spice don't eat that one but if you
like spice it's good at the mother when
top know the moment one's a one it's
like it's not even supposed to be hot
good yeah yeah give me two minutes I'll
just wait
yeah the reapers the reapers a bit of a
kick that one kind of sucks that's a
five sucks in terms of like it hurts it
takes a lot to be fair oh don't doubt it
like it's like um a powder like
something that you breathe powder yeah
but no flavors really good because they
try to they go pretty hard with the
flavor stuff which I like for beef jerky
I think that's one of the reasons well
let's go so much I'm cool it hot yeah no
it's not not too high I swear I'm cold
hot if it has flavor yeah hot for the
sake of hot no I'm in the same way yeah
I can deal with a fair amount of spice
but it's I only did not even like water
helps with the habanero I'm not thirsty
yeah alright I'm going to drop a bomb on
you guys this was originally posted by
NumLock 21 on the forum the original
article here is from video card bomb so
the grain of salt Intel claims the core
i7 8700 K will be 11 percent faster than
the 7700 K and here's what I want to
know because this is crazy
well it is to be fair a full entire one
percent higher than I
would have guessed this is what I want
to know who needed intel to claim this
to know that this is coming yeah I mean
this is literally does it mean being
about does this mean that they're not
scared okay so here's the thing so
there's two things first of all the
rumors are also that coffee lake is
going to be available in six core
configurations which would Ligon
okay so if they're keeping their 10%
anti-wrinkle it's their 10% faster in
terms of IPC and they're adding 60% more
cores then I'm looking at this going
that's a good jump thank you for what
should have happened two years ago but
okay yeah fine thank you I mean else I
still appreciate them doing something
good even if it was a long time coming
and should have happened before so 8700
KS for me to be the six core excuse them
it's supposed to be six quarts well
thread with a single threaded boost over
the 7700 K of about 11% yet there still
be an i-5 or next to 99 that time ah
yeah cuz like two nines I am refresh by
then so yeah I mean this is this is yet
another reason I mean you know okay you
know my feelings I know your feelings on
the 7740 and the 7640 those two skews
make no sense at all and when coffee
lake launches those skews remember the
whole point of the high-end desktop
platform is supposed to be
mucho memory bandwidth mucho PCIe lanes
and mucho processing cores and Moho
jerky those chips have none of those
things
they have beefed up power delivery so
theoretically you can overclock them a
little higher there still dual-core they
still have the mainstream platform
number of PCIe lanes and they're still
quad core process and they're pulling
significantly more power than their
mainstream counterparts and now compared
to the mainstream platform that's coming
oh I don't know what it's
rumored to be launching what in it so it
would be three months later if the
rumors are true it will be two
generations behind architectural II -
and that might only be 10% per
generation or 8% or whatever but still
two generations times 10% is not
complicated not that 3% so if you had a
five gigahertz processor let say you're
an overclocker it's actually better than
that because 10% on top of 10% that's
right so let's say you're you're an
overclocker you get to five gigahertz
we're talking about now on this high-end
platform you would be equivalent to the
mainstream's performance at what like
four gigahertz right well that's not
good
what did I just go spend $350 on a
motherboard intel says they're hoping
you're going to just step forward for
future compatibility with more expensive
bigger but why would you still spend you
know almost $400 on that CPU forgive me
I said that's the thing it's like I get
that argument if it's like a pentium
dual-core or something and that's
devil's advocate argument far as I'm
concerned right like like I've seen that
before like Pentium anniversary edition
we're talking $100 chip right you buy
something to get running today you hope
it doesn't drop in value too much you
flip because $100 CPU to drop some value
20% we're talking 20 bucks yeah right
and if you if you've managed to save up
your 400 or 500 dollars or whatever you
need for an 8 core processor by that
point then surely the $20 is not that
big of a deal some time has passed I get
that logic but here we're talking about
a 300 plus dollar processor that you're
buying as a placeholder doesn't make
sense you guys buy a $300 processor as a
placeholder in the socket I don't really
buy processors Plato based hey boy and
we never recommend that no do you guys
ever recommend that no I heart by
hardware that isn't what you actually
need and then like like buy something
else later yeah no I unless you're like
I'd be crazy like Craigslist or you site
junkie it's like you've done this kind
of stuff but you're constantly flipping
things so you were never planning
holding it for more than like possibly
even two weeks but even then it doesn't
matter you're not buying new anyway
that's no exact exactly so yeah it's not
even applicable so like I could see
buying a 77 40 from some idiot who
bought it realize that this was really
stupid and then it's like oh crap this
thing isn't worth much I guess I'll just
take a bath on it I could buy from that
guy yeah and then then I do buy myself a
few months to save up and I can probably
flip it for pretty close to what I paid
but I wouldn't buy something like that
new no so I threw mine in htpc just
because I was like what else am I going
to do with this Oh take the chip that
doesn't make sense and put it in a form
factor does it make sense for a next to
nine platform to begin with so that when
the whole video is based on that I just
figured we'd put nonsense on top of
nonsense okay and then I called it my VR
rig on top of that there you go oh we
are capable do you're capable sticker
improve on we got to get as reviewers we
need to get our own the are capable
stickers and to start putting them on
every single little watermark on the
video channel Oh herb they already this
video is via already yes but it's really
not well you could technically if you
put it in theater mode Oh true done
watch it Andy got here yes figure it out
V already this is he already life is B
already oh right yeah because you could
buy an oculus or anything else in life
which means that it's there already I
was going with Sony VR whatever it is
pal yeah also that what yeah okay
so the original article here's from ARS
technica I've been completely out of the
loop this week so I agree I can kind of
explain why so Apple is investing a huge
amount that it says they're going all-in
but Apple has a lot of money a billion
dollars is not all in so not at all but
they're they're putting a billion dollar
budget to Apple shows so they're doing
like the the first original series from
them was Planet of the apps and carpool
karaoke and they're doing more but this
isn't that surprising Netflix is going
really hardcore into original content
they're going to be putting these shows
on the Apple music thing so they
probably need to rename that
but oh well a lot of these big companies
that are trying to serve video are going
into original content because licensing
especially from like big movies and big
shows if you want to have all of them is
obscenely prohibitively expensive and
this is something you and I have
discussed apparently there isn't a video
streaming platform online like a
significant one I mean that's in about
losing money yeah and you know now that
we are really doing sometimes yeah well
sometimes there are parts of bigger
companies and then they don't care that
they're not losing money it's offset by
some other aspect of the business
exactly yeah but the actual video
streaming division whether we're talking
YouTube Amazon Prime video Netflix
twitch as far as we can tell they're all
losing money and like hearing from
certain people that work at some of
those companies not all of them but some
of those companies we know people that I
think we know at least someone it pretty
much all of them yeah which makes moves
like Disney pulling all of their movies
off of Netflix to have their own
streaming service just really make you
scratch your head
Amanda Disney has Disney money to spend
but still no company wants to bleed my
name but they already have a website and
they've already been streaming their own
video to be fair so they just have to
gala yeah but you could get their
settled in other places now no their
video is going to be available only on
one source so they're going to have to
probably upscale anyway and that way
they can control the pricing too they
can they can do and they can control the
content that goes around it there's any
cares about that a lot yeah they do and
also users already getting familiar with
needing to get their hands into so many
other platforms yeah and you know we're
talking about there's gonna be sites
that pop up that bring everything
together
they already exist all right well they
already thing yeah so you just kind of
like log in with all your logins there
and then it just becomes a single app
becomes one viewing site yeah so like I
got tons of tweets about that last time
yeah I think they're actually know what
I feel really stupid now because I know
Samsung had a thing built into their
smart TVs like a wild X is it all
together for years then actually it's
just a browser of the other browsers
yeah it just goes in finds and it can
even browse rental services like Google
client that's me you know what's really
funny is on the subject of Apple doing
their own original
programming and like they should
probably change the name of like iTunes
now I I gave Google so much crap about
Google Playstore back when they did it
now it totally makes sense yeah yeah
play music play games play videos oh
they actually got that one right yeah
way to go Google I just didn't way ahead
of time when in the moment it didn't
make a ton of sense it just made a lot
more sense of the future they were
playing they were playing 3d chess
they're doing the longest and I was
playing what should I do this wow that
was that was I was going on there I
didn't get it I mean that you were you
were making children at that point in
time no not yet okay yeah no not yet no
that was a solo effort oh that's why it
was just playing solo effort I see yeah
okay yeah yeah yeah so funky I'm
surprised though the 1 billion
characters okay hahaha oh yeah I put up
the green screen picture from earlier
and someone did that oh no I love how
you said that
oh no show him the other one would be
good where's your tonight how they can
okay I'll show you check down at Jay's
to fence I hear I can I can pull it up
yeah it's pretty it's pretty
so we Dmitriy night earlier if you guys
follow our social media we stood in
front there green screen and it was
they'll give you guys an opportunity to
key out and play around with green
screen pictures systems good oh that's a
really good creative people out there my
goodness okay let's go to media others
yeah also make sure to tag some of them
might not be appropriate so you might
not want to scroll live okay there it is
well there's there's a long we were
looking for that you're thinking of
there Jake would your highfalutin
bad who is that foxy foxy video Abe
what think there's a Sun okay oh man
that's great so we pick that that is
great ha ha alright see you
we're not have fun we can have fun some
work alright so here's some potentially
big news so PC gamer calm reports and
I'm just going to close this ad before I
screen share with you guys and videos
next gen Volta gaming GPUs not arriving
any times well why would they so this
picture right here is Jensen showing off
Volta already super duper definitely
working in the data center which means
based on the way that Nvidia rolls out
product they launch their big GPU first
and whatever product that is it used to
be GeForce now it never is but I'm not
bitter and video launches their big one
first which means they've got the
architecture down and then they just
they just cut they cut and cut and cut
and the performance goes down according
to how much they cut away that process
usually takes like two to three months
per per cut because they're even art is
obviously more complicated than just
like taking a pair of scissors to it you
know to a V 100 and like taping that to
a PCB like so there's R&amp;amp;D that is
involved with that you've only got so
many engineers at a time it's a resource
management thing so based on when they
showed off working like production Volta
silicon so in a while they could
probably be launching a g-force card now
if they felt like there's no reason to
there's no mark there's there's no
competition for them to do it and they
push back their HBM already generations
from when the original roadmap back in
like 2000 and deal was leaked yeah it
was max wobbly was when we were supposed
to first hov em but we super did but
they now look at Vega and there's just
like why even invest in the
manufacturing cost of this when we don't
have to when our when our traditional
architecture is still topping the
competition
and the other thing too is like nvidia
strategically you've seen it over the
last five years has moved from trying to
make the GPU faster faster faster to try
to build out technology around the GPU
whether it's stuff that doesn't make a
ton of sense to me personally like Ansel
is that that screenshotting yeah thing
where you can capture like super high
resolutions you guys know anyone that
uses it have you used it I've used it
only in a demo version just to see how
high resolution you can go if you go
like crank up the settings but outside
of seeing how beautiful you can turn
those screenshots for like witcher 3 and
other game is it has never does you want
a big poster on your on your i have
never used it ever like i'll tell you
guys this i remember this was a weird
experience for me at a land party this
was back when like I went to LAN party
so clearly I like to play video games
but I wasn't really like I didn't have
like a guild or like a clan or anything
like that so being like really into
video games was kind of alien to me and
there were these two people at a land
it's only like a 45 50 person land which
is like it's big but it's not that big
they spent like two hours literally it
felt like you know uncle Harold's like
vacation pictures one of them was
showing the other one an album of WoW
screenshots yeah like this was the time
we climbed to the top of freaking some
mountain never clear through the sang
and like whoever Clips through the thing
so it was hi Joel what I don't know what
you're talking you know this might have
been pretty cool ok one thing while
screenshots was like a big deal because
you'd show boss kills and you'd usually
have like the timestamp see if you were
like world first or server first or
whatever you could show the boss kill it
could be and if he's talking about my
condo Nigel's during the kill and this
is when you were at land parties so this
was probably classic Wow correct yeah in
classic Wow you were not allowed to get
the Mount Hyjal so he probably has a
similar screen shot set to me which is
glitching through many walls and over
many things and it takes like quite a
while to get there and you're just like
screwing the game repeatedly and you get
to a part of the game that has like
Blizzard co-construction signs and
there's stuff that never got released
that's in there
hmm like our commands like jig giant
skull leaning up against a tree and
stuff which was never in the game so it
was actually super cool and it was
glitchers it wasn't necessarily just
people that are interested in WoW
because I was a glitcher back then I
broke like every single aspect of Halo
to a friend of mine you talk Russia I
haven't talked to you in many years but
is that guy named you talk Russia him
and I used to play Halo 2 together and
we were like in the first group of
people that found the switching from
rocket to his sword and flying across
the entire math glitch if you knew that
one
I killed Hager you would do this thing
where the rocket the rocket you could
aim it at someone and it was show it
would show red because you were
targeting them right you remember that I
never played halo - that's an xbox game
okay whatever man-- if you I think it
happened in halo 1 - if you aimed over
top of someone the aimer would turn red
anyway I don't remember that long like
i'ma guess that was like a state and the
sword
if the aimer was red you would lunge
towards them and the state was shared so
if you switched it fast enough and
lunged it wouldn't notice that it wasn't
in that state anymore
so it would let you lunge to the person
but they're super far away because it's
the targeting from the rocket launcher
she just like so and just fly it it was
pretty cool we did a lot of other stuff
too
oh I'm gonna stop that Oh many many of
the screen shots were just like here's
me and this other person in a meadow no
it was really bad so okay anyway back to
come back to the topic a lot some of the
stuff in videos building doesn't make a
ton of sense to me like ansel but some
of the stuff they're building does make
a kind of sense things like streaming
better better GPU based encoding and
decoding okay all that kind of stuff
does make sense to me so pretty much
what they're doing is they're kind of
going we don't even we don't even need
to develop all much much faster GPU
every year we're just going to like put
more tech in it to the point where even
if the RX Vega 556 was the same price as
a gtx 1070 and videos whole thing on
their side is like we still think you
should buy a 1070 anyway because we do
release state drivers every time oh by
the way they're wickel ball and then
we've got all this other tech we've got
your shadow play and and all that kind
of stuff built into it and you know
AMD's approaches oh yeah but like our
approach is open and let you look at
some time but if videos started opening
slip-up - though sometimes open makes
sense
but only if you're actually doing any
work yeah because like look at okay so
stereoscopic 3d however much of an
abortion you may or may not think it is
indeed eeeh did a better job because
they actually did work on it whereas AMD
was just like yeah through I said 3d and
whatever that other thing was you can
enable stereoscopic 3d on our cards but
they were these janky third time did you
ever try eyes at 3d it's no I didn't it
was I never did in video 3 step either
it was awful
like if you think 3ds bad imagine 3d but
like there's no oxygen to say 3d ready
or whatever
yeah keep just to just to justice just
to have the checkbox it was super bad
yeah we did testing for that people are
telling me to shut up I think like three
quarters of the chatters Dmitriy return
in the chat yeah so much of it you
talked yeah I mean you give them what
they wanted okay here I've got something
for Dimitri to discuss this is posted by
Purina on the form the original article
here is from ARS technica and this blew
my mind
Bing is bigger than you think says
Microsoft with a quarter of UK searches
whoa Wow so saying a quarter of the
searches are from UK Ragno a quarter of
the UK's also use been they are using
Bing ten percent in Spain 19 percent in
France nine percent in use though is it
whatever that is what are they searching
there were just looking spikes to Donald
Chrome
hahaha that's probably legit man
apparently Taiwan is as high as 25% the
US is 33 yeah the u.s. is the biggest
percentage 16% Canada what these are
just what you did you just figures being
put out by marketing at lowest
percentage because they may be just
using type 2 search which uses being as
your as your search result I love how
they're saying Bing is bigger than you
think
and then there's literally multiple
single digit percentages yes that is
bigger than I think to be bear yeah but
what if you damn guys I
I honestly think like the media said
that's just because they're searching
for another browser to download on but
33 percent of all traffic in the USA is
not searching for another browser
download like I'm not even just trying
to be devil's advocate that's not
there's no way so if they're using
Cortana
yeah Cortana uses Bing so anytime you
type that in click enter it so that's
just a just a falsified not really
falsified but it's it's cute in that
make a name look like but I'm not going
to being I don't use Cortana begin with
but if I do a search or something down
here I'm not searching Bing I'm just
searching here usually for something on
my system but yeah but that doesn't work
that way most of the time it just gives
you driver download from from online but
a 13-3 Internet is what simultaneously
when you search for something local so
that is not really a good representation
of being usage yeah that and I
accidentally used Bing a lot
accidentally yeah you contribute to that
how many 13 14 16 per second Canada so
I'll like I'll launch edge because I
haven't bothered to install another
browser yet and I'll search for
something I'll be like aw crap
well have said sir I want to do I want
to Chad just said Alexa users name and
he Alexis huge in the state that would
maybe make sense why it's 33 percent
there because apparently globally it's
about 9 percent out and then 33 percent
in the USA that's huge
even like a homecare users being here
that can't be right
I'm pretty sure that's not right Bing is
for porn apparently quick yeah so a
certain a certain friend of ours in
Seattle would say that like I guess the
algorithm for that is way better ah a
certain friend of ours in Seattle yeah
well I'm not getting involved in you
guys um thanks again to Jane Dimitri not
only for being here for scrapyard wars
but also for being here on the show so
you can find Jay over at I think I know
the answer you sense with a Z not to be
confused with the rapper yeah
and I said hardware conducts click yeah
I'm just I'm leaving it cuz it's funny
oh I'll do it there you go perfect oh we
should have done a special intro with
like you guys like on planes coming here
that would have been real long it's like
a chair supporter like biplane scarves
and goggles do do like Epsilon
yeah they bring that on a channel yeah
you want to see a travel vlog go to
Dimitri's channel where we're connect I
recommend the dumb personal journey I
know I'm collecting stuff still oh yeah
they'll be good they'll be good</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
