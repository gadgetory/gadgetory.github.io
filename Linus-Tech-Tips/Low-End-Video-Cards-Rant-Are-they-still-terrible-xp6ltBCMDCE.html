released a video called low end video
cards rant and Radeon r7 240 unboxing
and review which was known internally as
low end graphics cards or you can click
here to go check it out if you do go
check it out scroll down a bit to the
comments this is why we were determined
that we needed a follow-up I will
address some of those that commented and
their misconceptions and try to add a
bit of my own points to the conversation
through some interesting benchmarks
let's do this
a Pacers as7 20 is a dual interphase SSD
with USB 3.1 type C on one end and se2
on the other with read speeds of up to
540 megabytes per second and write
speeds of 450 megabytes per second check
the link in the video description to
learn more
the first comment I'm going to address
was from Michael H aka freakazoid 777
Michael claimed that he could think of
many situations where one would want to
buy a low profile ultra cheap graphics
card but that Linus's gamer mind clearly
polluted his ability to think outside
the box a little aggro but regardless
linus already replied and Michael
admitted that he may have been a little
off the point with that one the point
linus was trying to make wasn't that no
one could ever use a low-profile
graphics card the point he was trying to
make is that the r7 240 is actually too
expensive for the performance it
delivers making it a terrible value this
is not only true for games but also for
any application that relies on GPU power
so thinking outside the box if you
needed the compute performance it just
isn't there
mccafferty ford a mean any way unless
they're ill informed that people should
buy these if say they have an older
motherboard that the video out died on
or they just need more ports in general
sorry but that would also be
ill-informed if someone just needs more
video out ports buying this card is
literally throwing money away if you
just need a graphics card so you can
hook up more monitors you could pick up
something like the gt2 10 it's 30 bucks
on Amazon compared to the 74 an r7 240
has DVI HDMI and VGA connections is
passively cooled and if you spend $35
total it has free shipping so grab
yourself a couple snacks and a drink
within a couple days you've got some nom
noms and a GPU for half the price that
is going to be equally capable of
driving your extra monitors for non
gaming or compute applications if you
don't care about low profile which is
likely but your problem lies more on the
affordability side of things I would
still definitely not ever buy this card
there are comments talking about needing
a graphics card but not having the money
to get to the price per performance
sweet spot
Linus suggested just waiting and saving
but we also understand that this isn't
an option for everyone if this is your
budget and it's not gonna change that's
fine
buy something used checkout scrapyard
Wars we build pretty kick-ass computers
for like three hundred bucks all the
time and the budget that you'd have for
something like an r7 240 looking at my
local use sites like Craigslist could
get a gtx 660 which would kick its ass
in terms of performance so no that's not
a valid argument basically if all you
need is a low profile card get a
different one if you don't care about
gaming performance this is too expensive
for your use case find something else if
you don't have the money for something
new that's better buy used we're not
trying to attack people that don't have
the money for the vast majority of my
life that's where I was at we're trying
to help them to not waste the little
that they have on trash that offers no
benefit okay so that addresses I hope
the issues people had with the first
video which brings us to the new part of
this video the 2016 update if you will
since we don't have the r7 240 anymore I
went out and bought the newest card that
I could find in that price point and
what I could find it up being the Nvidia
GT 730 we weren't the Green Team this
time to demonstrate that we weren't
picking on AMD specifically last time
around and that the problem is actually
Universal it's basically the same story
as the r7 240 I put this on our standard
graphics card test bench running
alongside an i7 59 30 K in order to not
have to worry about bottle necking at
all and then I tested it against a 6700
K not overclocked using its integrated
GPU the Intel HD graphics 530 the
results may be a little surprising the
6700 K with its integrated graphics card
handily beat the 730 in Tomb Raider more
or less equal that in counter-strike and
didn't do quite as bad as it did in Far
Cry 4 in every scenario it was better
the 730 just had its ass handed to it by
an integrated GPU I realize this
scenario won't be applicable to a ton of
people but if you will be able to save
up for more but need a system now I
don't have quite the money for
everything that you wanted instead of
stepping down your platform and buying
some
thing like at 7:30 just wait and run
your eye GPU for a bit and get something
more sensible later on basically what
we're trying to say is that there are
lots of good approaches by a cheaper
low-profile card with the video it's
that you need buy used or use your eye
GPU or APU the only terrible option is
buying an entry-level card like the r7
240 or GT 730 speaking of good solutions
crunchyroll is a site created by anime
fans for anime fans which usually is
actually a pretty good solution they
offer the most current episodes of new
shows straight from Japan like erased or
active raid and they have large
collections of popular anime series that
everyone has heard of like one piece or
Naruto all of them are professionally
subtitled within an hour of their
premiere in Japan so I head over to
crunchyroll.com slash Linus you get a
30-day free trial of crunchyroll premium
that gives you no ads you can watch on
whatever device you want consoles even
phones tablets laptops computers 1080p
streaming like I said episodes straight
from Japan and if you like it after
those 30 days it's only 695 a month so
again crunchyroll.com slash Linus check
it out
thanks for watching guys if that video
sucked or if you still somehow disagree
with us you know what to do but if it
was awesome get subscribed hit the like
button or even consider supporting us
directly by using our Amazon affiliate
code to shop for stuff that you know
Amazon buying cool t-shirt like this one
in the comment in the description down
below thingy or with a direct monthly
contribution through the forum now that
you done doing all that kind of stuff
you're probably wondering what to watch
next so click the button in the top
right hand corner just check out this
video where we unbox and review a car
that is great to buy used and has been
featured on scrapyard wars twice it's
not that cheap but the value is
absolutely pretty good so yeah it's a
it's a 290 it's an r9 it's an hour 99
it's it's something</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
