this is the Platinum Series of power
supplies from C sonic which is a very
creative name because it has a t+
Platinum certification very creative
okay so we've got sort of a platinum
theme to the overall look of the package
sort of this like shiny whitish metallic
II sort of thing going on let's have a
look at hmm let me see let's look at
this side of the box first so here we
see the general specs this is an ATX
12-volt or EPS 12-volt power supply
there's the dimensions 80-plus Platinum
one of the first power supplies to
obtain that certification it's got all
your usual protections under voltage
protection over current protection over
voltage protection all that good stuff
okay full range something something yep
so it accepts all inputs whether you're
in Europe or Japan or Canada or wherever
the case may be all the connectors are
here but we'll see that when we when we
open up the box so you can see it can
provide up to nine hundred and ninety
six watts on the 12 volt rail almost the
entire rated wattage on the 12 volt rail
alone it is a fully modular power supply
as you guys can see here and here's a
little switch this has fan control
hybrid and normal I wonder what that
means I guess we'll find out as we move
along with this unboxing so let's get
the Box open first and we find a couple
of things here our commitment to quality
24 hour service I was not aware that see
sonic had 24 hour service but apparently
they do they also have a 7 year warranty
on this particular unit here is your
owner's manual and a variety of
different languages hopefully one of
them is English well look at this
there's an 8 60 watt available as well
but we only have the 1000 watt to show
you guys so 80-plus platinum here let's
see what they have to say check this up
greater than 90 92 and 89 percent
efficient at twenty fifty and a hundred
percent operating loads that is
un-freakin'-believable
because you could almost call it 90 plus
at this point and it wouldn't be much of
a stretch yeah the 80 plus program which
was designed to make power supplies or
consumers were aware of the efficiency
of the rule that efficiency plays in
your power supply has has brought us a
long way in the last few years because
it used to be that you know a great
power supply was 80 plus well now we
have left that benchmark long far far
far behind so we got a couple of
accessories here including some velcro
cable ties silver start browser silver
see sonic powered by sticker we've got
some regular zip cable ties we've got a
little screwdriver which helps you
install these screws to install the
power supply in your case you've also
got some great closed cell foam padding
that's going to keep it nice and
protected we've got a well that's gold
marks off for that see sonic this is an
80 plus platinum power supply now I'm
just kidding it's fine okay we've
actually got the power supply itself
which I'm not going to show you yet okay
so we'll put that aside for now and
let's have a look at the modular cables
that are included so here we go the
first thing we're going to check out is
the 24 pin connector so the 24 pin
connector looks a little something like
this
okay there we go it's approximately sort
of one
Linus arm length in length and it plugs
in via split connector on the power
supply side and then it has a split 20/4
pin 24-pin connector on the other side
plenty long for whatever you might need
it for we've got one of these single
connector two dual PCIe six plus two pin
connectors so you have one of those two
of those three of those three of those
four up to 3-way SLI or crossfire with
high end cards natively and then we've
got dual and I'm going to see how long
these ones are because I'm a little bit
on the curious side here dual 8 pin
connectors so these ones plug into
probably the same outlets on the power
supply and then they go to an eight pin
or a four plus four pin and these look
like they should be plenty long enough
at about one Linus arm length to reach
from your power supply in the bottom of
your case to
top although you might need a bit of an
extension if you have a particularly
tall case with a bottom mounted power
supply all right
what do we got here lots and lots of
different kinds of adapters so we've got
a molex to do a floppy just in case you
still need one of those we've got a
three SATA cable we have another three
SATA cable and we have another three
SATA cable we have a two SATA cable and
that is it
so three three SATA cables and one two
SATA cable and then we have a three
molex cable a three molex cable and a
two molex cable so that gives you all of
your options in terms of mounting so I'm
just going to take this box and this is
going to help me as I tell you about
some of the cool features of this
particular unit so let's check out the
physical aspects of it first so on the
back we find the fully modular power
supply and check this out so remove
before use okay fine do 200
didn't say rip it and pieces before use
but whatever so check this up hybrid or
normal fan control
so what hybrid fan control actually does
is it allows the fan to operate
completely silently up until about 30
percent load so it's actually going to
take this very high quality fan which by
the way is a sin a sanyo Denki fan so
very very commonly widely known to be
some of the highest quality fans
available and it just turns it off
because when you're 80 plus platinum and
you're only pulling about you know 330
watts
apparently this power supply with the
heat sinks that you can see through the
the grille here on the top with those
heat sinks is capable of being passively
cooled up to that point then the fan
ramps up actually they've got a picture
of the fan curve here so I might as well
show it to you on the box so then this
is fanless mode up to 30 percent up to
50 percent were in silent mode so where
the fan RPMs are you can see on this
part of the graph barely barely barely
doing anything okay and then finally
greater than 50 percent were in cooling
mode and that is going to ramp up the
fan
you don't reach sort of a hundred
percent of your rpms until a 100 percent
load and by the time you're actually
pulling a thousand Watts through power
supply we're talking like dual GTX 590 s
you know heavily overclocked CPU bunch
of drives this is a very very loaded
system and it's only going to reach that
kind of a load once in a very very very
while so see Sonic's also claiming tight
voltage regulation plus or minus two
percent which is way way way within the
ATX specification so let's have a look
at the rest of the unit here we've got
our power switch we've got our power
input we've got honeycomb grills which
are optimal for the best airflow
okay moving over here we've got the 80
plus Platinum branding as well as the
Platinum power supply series grant
branding here on the modular interface
side you can see we've got our
motherboard stuff CPU this is an okay
and interesting okay so here is three
PCIe those dual connector ones and he
and then okay okay here here here here
here
okay so I'm going to explain how this
works so you can either have three
graphics cards and then dual EPS
connectors or you can have four graphics
cards and a single EPS connector because
that is the point of a modular power
supply which many manufacturers by the
way seem to have forgotten is that it
should give you some kind of a choice in
terms of which connectors you want to
plug into it we then also have six
peripheral connectors so you can use
those for your molex four pins or your
SATA cables and that is pretty much it
you also get to choose which fan mode
you want I think I mentioned that a
couple times but I think that's really
cool you can go in hybrid mode or you
can just go in normal mode which is not
going to turn off the fan should you not
desire it to do so although I cannot
imagine why you would not want it to do
that
so in summary it is a D+ Platinum which
is about as efficient as it gets these
days
has a very high quality fan which it if
you prefer will just simply turn off
when your computer is idling which means
that this should be in theory pretty
much the quietest power supply you can
get short of C Sonic's own x-series
passive power supplies
which I love and their 80 plus gold so
this is like even more loveable than 80
plus gold so thank you for checking out
this unboxing and first look don't
forget to subscribe planners tech tips
from our unboxings reviews and other
computer videos a couple things we
missed gold plated connectors are going
to give you the best possible connection
between these power supply and the
motherboard so you've heard of people
talking about things like that where is
it 24 pin burn where there's too much
current being drawn through the 24 pin
connector because you've got a lot of
graphics cards installed and a bad
connection causes the the wires to
actually burn inside whether it's on the
motherboard or whether it's in the
connector well gold plating remember
gold is not actually the most conductive
substance but what it is is it is
malleable it is soft so it is it has a
better chance of making a good
connection between one thing and another
thing then something that is not gold so
that is something that I did miss
another thing is that the capacitors in
here are all solid caps and they are
rated at 105 degrees so that is
definitely hotter than I hope your power
supply ever runs but in the event that
it does it is rated for it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
