for more details welcome to my unboxing
and first look at the SteelSeries flux
in here now I've been using the in-ear
pros for a couple of weeks now and I
have to say I absolutely love them with
that said the in-ear pros with their
complied tips and all the adapters so
you can use the microphone on your PC
and all that kind of stuff are a more
premium option they do cost quite a bit
more than the in years which I haven't
had the pleasure to try yet but I am
looking forward to checking them out so
the in years like I said more value
oriented product with that said they
still feature 6 millimeter drivers which
at this kind of a price point is a good
thing it still has a microphone and my
expectation because it's a steel series
product is that the microphones not
going to be that bad for example on the
in-ear pros when we did our video about
them we actually recorded part of the
audio from the video with the inline
microphone that was built into one of
the sides and the thing that surprised
me about it was the audio quality
actually wasn't bad even though the
microphone wasn't sitting right next to
my mouth so I'm really excited to check
that out so what do they have to say for
themselves here frequency response 20
Hertz to 20 kilohertz okay 90 no
impedance this is important because you
want that to be a low number for mobile
devices so that they're able to push
audio clearly more easily all right a
hundred decibel sensitivity gotchya 1.2
meter flat cable we'll show you that in
a moment and the mic pattern is
omnidirectional so it is not a
directional mic which is good because
when you have a mic that's built into
the wire on an in-ear headphone like
this if it's facing the wrong way for
example the only thing it would hear is
the sound of your shirt moving against
it so they include a QuickStart guide
some mobile accessories including their
flux headphones which you can get in a
variety of different finishes and
whatnot the free I don't know what this
one is but this is the free game
controller it's a Bluetooth game
controller we've got a SteelSeries
sticker as well as
mm-hmm Oh a warning about not damaging
your hearing other than that nothing
else else inside the box so the
packaging is pretty bare-bones it comes
with a little pouch to keep your
headphones in as well as your accessory
so it comes with three different sizes
of ear tips large extra large and
gargantuan now I'm just kidding it comes
with small medium and large so we can go
ahead and check that out so it looks
like the small ones and the large ones
are the ones that are not actually pre
attached to the headset so we'll go
ahead and open this up now unlike the
pro it doesn't come with the adaptor to
take the four pull two to three pulls
for plugging into a PC with that said
you could use an adapter and you could
still plug it in should you so desire it
also doesn't have quite the same
thickness of cable as the pro so on the
left you see the non pro and on the
right you see the pro so that's that's
what makes the cable non-tangible I Taz
tangle resistant as the pro level skew
but again this makes sense if they're
also a little bit lighter weight one
thing I noticed about the pros is that
they do tend to have some some weight on
your head when you're wearing them but
it's okay because they wrap around the
ear so there's somewhere for that weight
to be supported with the non pros they
are intended it's either labeled here
there's your left and there's your right
on the inside of the earbud paste they
are intended to be worn like normal IEMs
which is right inside the ear canal
hanging down like this so SteelSeries
calls them passively noise-canceling
which basically means that because of
the seal that they have between your ear
and the outside world there's no there's
no background has no active noise
cancellation but they are isolating and
that you are less able to hear the noise
around you you can swap the ear tips
relatively easily as with pretty much
all imc look you can see there's that
those six millimeter drivers that's why
the end of these are so big compared to
most low-cost headphones that you find
out there and buy low-cost I sort of
mean anything under sort of three
figures and the reason that's so big is
because they actually have a bigger
speaker in it the overall ID looks very
nice it has kind of a rubberized four
here and then the silver SteelSeries
logo so it's not just white it actually
has some shininess to it one advantage
that the non pros have over the pros is
that the pros switched to a round cord
up at the top
meaning they lose some of their tangle
resistance near the top and this is
because they wrap around your ear
whereas the non pros use a flat cable
all the way from the bottom to the top
they have an inline volume control or
rather an inline microphone and then an
inline control it's not volume control
but you can use this to take a call on
your phone or hang up a call because it
does have a built-in microphone and then
you've also got a little SteelSeries
logo on the back there so that's pretty
much what you'd expect cable lengthwise
this is a good test for any sort of
headphone because you always want to
know okay so when I'm actually wearing
the thing so I'll plug into my my phone
here do I have enough slack so that I
can kind of make it under a shirt and
then sort of up a shirt and then see how
it goes from there now I think the
mediums are a little bit big for me so
I'm going to want to switch to the
smalls before I really listen to them
and I'm just going to see if we missed
anything else that SteelSeries has to
say about themselves so I mean they're a
gaming company so they're obviously
saying yet you can use these for gaming
but you're not required to you can use
them with your phone or other devices as
well and I think that's pretty much all
there is to say about it advanced
dynamic drivers for detailed sound
inline microphone and controls you know
what I do want to do a quick test of the
of the tangle resistance here wow those
really like suction into your ears
that's uh that's a bit different so
let's go ahead let's give it a good
tangle shall we this will be the last
thing in this video so we're going to do
the whole like tangle it up really good
put it in the pocket and let's see how
the the tangle resistance holds up for
the for the in ears so it should be
noted that there's no such thing as a
pair of headphones that is completely
tangled proof which is why whenever I
see tangled proof on the box for a
product I do say tangle resistant but
when I compare these to my clip chef's
for eyes when I did those with the S
force I had a much bigger problem than
that getting them undone so very nice
