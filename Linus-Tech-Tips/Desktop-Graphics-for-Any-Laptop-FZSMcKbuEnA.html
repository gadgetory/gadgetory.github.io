developed by Intel but you can learn
more about here has always been based on
PCI Express yes the same PCI Express
that you use to add internal expansion
cards to a desktop computer so to say
that I've been amped about the idea of
being able to staple a video card to a
laptop for a long time would be an
understatement
well it's finally a reality let's take a
look then at the Razer core
the phoenix auteur is a full-sized
minimalistic li designed keyboard
complete with gold-plated Cherry MX
brown switches check out the link in the
video description to learn more laptop
CPUs have for about three generations
now been available in quad-core variants
that boast single threaded performance
that's fast enough for them to avoid
being a gaming bottleneck while being
power efficient enough not to require a
nuclear reactor strapped to the bottom
of your computer to run for more than an
hour or so
laptop GPUs or video cards while they've
made enormous strides are a different
story altogether
relatively speaking they are hot either
thermal throttling during real world use
or requiring large cooling systems and
they suck so much power that if you're
running on battery
they not only drain it during operation
but in the case of very high-end ones
they can't even run at full capacity if
they wanted to due to battery power
delivery limits well that's easy Linus
just buy a desktop I mean yeah you could
do that but not everyone wants more than
one computer and lots of people actually
prefer to use a laptop and this problem
of how to satisfy the people who value
Portability and battery life and who
also like PC gaming is one that the
industry has been trying to solve for a
long time some of these solutions never
made it to market this really cool
prototype from gigabyte used proprietary
connectors on high-end shielded cables
to take a full pci express 16x interface
to an outside box while others did
Alienware designed a proprietary PCIe 4x
cable and interface that was implemented
on a couple of their gaming laptop
models and the msi GS 13 express 16x
connector hidden by a dust cover on the
back that plugs into a proprietary box
that not only supports an expansion card
but also additional storage and i/o neat
but while they both address the heat
power and upgrade ability issues
that plague gaming notebooks they
introduced cost compatibility and
usability ones since PCI Express cannot
be hot plugged requiring a full system
shutdown whenever the user wanted to
unplug it or plug it back in an off
history lesson though let's take a
closer look at the core Razer solution
that promises to fix everything
including doing away with proprietary
interfaces in favor of Thunderbolt 3
using a USB type-c connector man these
guys are good at industrial design this
thing could be in a cardboard box with
holes punched in it for all the
difference that would make to
performance but instead razor turned out
what is in my opinion a shockingly
attractive piece of hi-tech art that I
would be happy to have on my desk it's
constructed almost entirely from thick
black anodized aluminum with to LED
lighting zones on the bottom and on the
inside by the left side mesh window that
can be configured to any color and
effect you want from within synapse even
oft if you care less about the flash and
more about the dash on the subject of
speed I couldn't actually believe how
fast it was to get started with the core
a complete graphics card installation
can be done in less than five minutes
even if you've never installed a
graphics card before just open the lock
at the back that doubles as a handle
pull it out revealing a single PCI
Express 16x physical slot and a
customized 500 watt enhanced power
supply remove the backplate screw slot
in your new video card plug in the power
connectors screw it in and
bippity-boppity-boo that is it thanks to
ample Headroom and the inclusion of two
six plus two pin connectors you can
install almost any graphics card on the
market though it wouldn't be a terrible
idea to consult razors compatibility
list before making a purchase for my
part I went ahead with a GTX 1080
founders edition that wasn't on the list
but worked just fine so your mileage may
vary with the graphics card installed we
can take a look at the business end of
things the back here you'll find a
standard PC power input a USB type-c can
dirt that is carrying Thunderbolt 3 4
USB 3.0 ports and hallelujah a Gigabit
Ethernet port yay
setup was actually pretty
straightforward you'll need the latest
drivers for the video card you installed
from AMD or nvidia x' website you'll
need razer synapse driver utility and in
the case of the blade 14 but not the
blade stealth you'll need the GPU
switcher app that sits in the system
tray its beta right now but
functionality wise it does what it's
supposed to allowing you to select which
dedicated video card you want to use and
even remembering your preference through
a system reboot or you can just leave it
on auto mode but how much of a
performance boost can you expect how
well does a video card operate over this
rinky-dink little cable the short answer
is well I guess it depends on what
graphics card you put into it and the
long answer is much more complicated and
actually looks like I'm sorry it's going
to end up in a separate video but in the
meantime here are some numbers with a
gtx 1080 as a point of comparison
against the 970m that I use in my blade
14 let's talk about the usability a bit
though notably absent from the core is a
power switch instead it simply detects
when the device that it's plugged in to
turns on and powers up alongside it this
is the first thing that stood out to me
is a potential area for improvement for
the next generation it would be nice to
be able to power up just the USB hub and
Ethernet port to use the core as a more
basic dock which is something I actually
wouldn't desire if it weren't for
complaint number two the core is not
very quiet and surprisingly it doesn't
seem to be the video cards fault I mean
it's certainly quieter under full gaming
load than a blade 14 under full gaming
load using its d GPU but the enclosures
fans are significantly louder at idle
than a blade 14 at idle making light
productivity applications kind of
frustrating number three is both praised
for the core and a huge complaint about
the blade 14 2016 I
assumed the core would require an
external display connected to the back
of it to work but it actually doesn't
which is awesome you can use the power
of your external video card to drive
that 3200 by 1800 onboard display SiC
unfortunately the type-c connector is on
the right on this laptop meaning that
the cable can get in the way of using
the mouse and this is made worse by the
pathetically short cable that razor
includes in the box and there are other
niggles at the moment as well mostly to
do with transitioning between your eye
GPU d GPU and what I'm going to call a
GPU the one in here the switcher app can
be hard to dismiss sometimes I plugged
in while the computer was asleep and my
trackpad buttons weren't working until a
reboot once running firestrike back to
back on d GPU then a GPU yields a
massive improvement in scores but going
the other way resulted in a black screen
after the first segment of the second
test until I rebooted the system I was
able to repeat that several times and
there were a few little things like that
but with that said my experience using
it now and we're still a bit early by
the way gives me a lot of hope
performance improvements are real
thermals look great and while at CES
2016 I managed to force a hard reset on
the demo system by pulling the plug
while running a 3d application
impressively six months later with
heaven running not only does the system
not fully lock up but after a little
while oh no it did crash that time I've
seen this work though after a little
while heaven actually managed to get
back up and running I'll be it slowly on
the eye GPU a lot of progress has been
made
and while eSports titles will probably
be fine with the blade 14s built-in
graphics for years to come making the
future proof this argument for spending
this kind of money a moot point for a
gamer who wants to play the latest
triple-a titles
and heaven forbid VR games on his or her
notebook the core looks on the surface
like a superbly elegant I'll be it
expensive solution but as I alluded to
before there are a lot of deeper
questions that I found myself asking
about this product during my time with
it
so many in fact that I'm going to set
aside a significant chunk of time before
the core is available to you guys to buy
to attempt to answer them all
speaking of answers you were probably
asking yourself wow where did Linus get
that sexy pink skin for his razor blade
to which the answer is of course from D
brand D brand is your source for awesome
vinyl skins for your phone tablet
console controllers and more they're
affordable and they ship worldwide but
the best thing about D brand is the
configurator on their site you pick your
device you pick all your colors and you
can actually mix and match colors which
I personally think looks freaking
awesome but your mileage may vary with
that you get to preview what it's going
to look like you place your order and
boom they're robots pack it and ship it
to you and if there's anything wrong
their customer service robots are ace so
