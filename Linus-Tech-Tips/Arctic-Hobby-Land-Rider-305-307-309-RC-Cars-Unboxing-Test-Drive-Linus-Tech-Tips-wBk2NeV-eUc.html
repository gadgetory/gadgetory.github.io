mass unboxing of several products from
Arctic cooling well Arctic hobby Arctic
convey sorry sorry sorry so we have okay
we've got a few things let's get the
quick ones out of the way really quick
here so we have a charger for batteries
okay we also have the controller that we
have we have three of these controllers
but I only felt it necessary to grab one
of them for the sake of this unboxing so
the controller allows you to control any
one of these particular land riders okay
so we've had a look at a few Arctic
hobby products so far we have a look at
their tank their fire engine as well as
their boat and I'm sure there's one more
right there was an excavator so so far
the overall prevailing opinion from us
and our viewers is that these are
actually a surprisingly good value and
kind of beat for the price so we've got
a few more things to check out so here's
the remote we haven't actually looked at
this remote up close yet so fairly
straightforward you've got your
cardboard that is apparently too
complicated for me ah staples that's
what was going on okay let's look lip it
over and I will use the knife to cut the
incredibly thick zip tie that was deemed
necessary by somebody to put on there
take another crack at it there we go
alright now the controller comes out so
these controllers there's your throttle
there's your other stuff it has multiple
channels that are supported up to two
channels so you can race oh that's kind
of nice actually it's got like a foamy
outside on the sort of chromey rim
looking thingamabob or going on here
here's your power powered by 100-billion
double-a batteries okay actually not one
hundred billion eight but those numbers
are very similar
okay and the functionality changes
depending on what you're using ah this
is interesting so this is the Crystal
module so you'll use that to make sure
that you're on the same frequency as
whatever particular car that you are
using so you can pop that whole thing
out should you so desire although I
really don't see the point but I'm going
to do it anyway just because it's
pointless doesn't mean I'm not going to
do it on the show there you go so it
works like that oh oh you better make
sure you put that back in carefully
because all of those seem to have to go
back in there we go okay so that's the
controller that comes with anyone who's
given RC vehicles now let's have a look
at the vehicles themselves so we have
the land Rider 305 on Road racing car we
have the land rider 307 off-road truck
and we have the land rider 309 off-road
truck II and I think what they mean is
truck / buggy so let's get these all
opened up I'm not actually going to do
the unboxing for them so we can show you
the features of them because it's going
to take way too long to do three
unboxings in a rebel so we've got them
opened up now it was a bit of a headache
to get all the antennas in and all that
kind of stuff but we're pretty much done
so we've got the land Rider 305 307 and
309 so this is the car the truck and the
truck year you know truck buggy whatever
you want to call it we also have the to1
digital transmitter now this can be used
to control a number of different models
and you can save different profiles in
it it's actually got a fairly
complicated menu structure but the
documentation that comes with it sorry
spells everything out like this in
little diagram trees so you can follow
along for whatever it is that you need
to do you can adjust all kinds of neat
stuff like exponential steering and
reversing your channels and anything
like that that you would want to do you
use the crystal so we've installed the
number two band crystal in the back this
is an AM transmitter so this is the same
crystal that came with all of these
different trucks but if you wanted to
race them you need to make sure that you
have two separate crystals for the two
vehicles that you want to race at the
same time
you know your friend or whoever else
okay so let's talk a little bit about
the various differences between these
models so this guy has very very low
clearance to the ground especially once
once the weight is on it these wheels
compress a little bit so this is an
on-road sort of race car II type thing
chalk wise uh oh yeah you go oh yeah
yeah yeah slick wants me to mention that
see how these posts have lots of
different holes you can actually use
those to raise it up a little bit if you
want so I'll show you guys how easy that
is to do removing the top plastic covers
is also the way that you access the
internals of the vehicle itself so
there's the heatsink on the motor
there's your crystal so you can actually
change out the crystals not only in the
car and the but also in the transmitter
or not only in the transmitter but also
in the car
there's your on switch there's your
front shocks fairly meager on this model
but you guys will see on the other ones
that's not to say that all of them are
like that pretty good on the back there
is your battery here a battery pack
includes six cells so in order to charge
it all you do is unplug it from here run
it out from under the plastic cover or
not under the plastic cover whatever
else and you charge the battery up
without actually removing it from the
car at all you can see here is the
receiver so we've only got a couple of
different channels that we're using on
that so basically throttle and then this
guy right here seems actually fairly
well built and just like the just like
some of the other ones we've looked at
like you can see it's got like real
tires on it and all that kind of stuff
it's pretty deep okay so let's go ahead
and put that one aside for now so that's
the on-road racing car next we have the
off-road truck and this one is actually
my personal favorite based on our
limited experience with these vehicles
so far because check this out this one
just looks absolutely built inside looks
like the same actual motor okay the same
receiver same number of channels being
used but all of this stuff looks pretty
darn similar there's your on switch okay
but look at how built the shocks are on
this
I so you've got a lot of give they're
actually tires are like beasts lots of
traction all that good stuff
your front grille you got your back
grille rear tires are just as built and
what I like about the shocks on this guy
is check this out
they've got a lot of here there's a bit
of a delay before they come up so
they're very very cushiony even if it's
bouncing around out there you're going
to retain whatever traction you happen
to need so that's I think that's pretty
cool so there's that one and then
finally we've got the truggy and this
one is once again more built than the
on-road car because it's meant for more
like an off-road type scenario once
again fairly similar internals but only
one set of shocks and using a
significantly wider spacing of spring so
they're more bouncy and less cushiony so
depending on the scenario you have this
one is probably going to protect you
from a fall a little bit better but not
necessarily as good for keeping all the
tires on the road at any given time
because there's a little bit more bounce
to it a little bit less stability going
on there so they all use the same cells
inside right here so the parts are very
interchangeably you can see once you
look at the internal guts they are very
very similar in terms of the platforms
that they're built on much like a Toyota
versus a Lexus but it's just in the
detailing where the differences really
come out so thank you for checking out
my unboxing your first look at the Land
Rider car series from Arctic hobby don't
forget to subscribe for his tech tips
from unboxings reviews and other
computer videos so it's breakfast time
and trying out the land riders time this
is the 309 right here so the one that
we're actually going to be testing in
the video here is the 307 they're all
built on the same platform it's just
varying shocks anyway right guys
so there's the three own three oh shoot
into that no sorry that's a 309 out
there so I've got it in my backyard I am
actually super impressed with the
performance in this thing so for one
thing the throttle is is not just on
Offutt saw whatever the word is for that
you can adjust all the trims on the
controller the whole setup process takes
only a couple minutes your wheels are
not just the straight on/off - so you
have a lot of granularity in terms of
your steering control you can turn a
little bit you can turn a lot okay so
here we go check this out and this is
not just the burst of energy it gets
when you first power it on this has been
going for about five minutes already and
it's still got a fair amount of augusto
you can see that my lawn is very uneven
um but in spite of that it still
performs admirably just climbing over
everything here I'm going to head out
into the other part of the yard it's a
little sea I can go like over the rocks
in the middle Jacy there we go can get a
fair bit of speed going it can obviously
go fast if you bring it out onto the
concrete you can see it speeds up quite
a bit on the concrete but yeah the the
offroad I mean off-road RC vehicles when
I was a kid
certainly did not handle offroad did you
lose it certainly did not handle
off-road scenarios very well but it
looks like that has changed so thank you
for checking out this video of the
performance and the unboxing I guess
I'll just amend this to the end of the
unboxing don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
