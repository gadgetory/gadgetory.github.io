Intel Core i5 2500 K this is one of the
best value processors out of their new
Core i5 and core i7 second generation
series of chips so the first thing I
need to tell you guys about a core i5
2500 K versus an i7 2600
is that the core i5 does not support
hyper threading so that means that you
have 4 physical cores just like each
other and you also have hyper threading
on an i7 series processor now another
thing that is well I guess you could
call it missing on an i5 2500 K is 2
Meg's of cache so it only has 6 Meg's of
cash versus 8 Meg's of cash although
this has not been demonstrated to make a
very big difference in terms of
performance now this is this is meant
more as a comparison against between the
2500 K and the 2600 K than anything else
I'm going to show you guys some of the
other comparison points so one of the
other things is that this 2500 K is
clocked at 3.3 gigahertz versus the 2600
K is clocked at 3.4 gigahertz now that
probably doesn't make much of a
difference because these are both
because of that K designation fully
unlocked and Unleashed processors that
means that with good aftermarket cooling
whether it's air or liquid you can take
this processor well beyond the stock
frequency and overclock the snot out of
it
regardless pretty much of which
motherboard you're using because we are
no longer dependent on the motherboard
for much beyond really the power
delivery to the CPU you don't have to
overclock the qpi or the frontside bus
or any of that stuff any longer you just
turn up the multiplier on these K series
processors so they're definitely worth
the extra couple bucks over the non k
tip K series processors also have
slightly upgraded onboard graphics
versus the non K chips so this uses the
HD 3000 engine whereas even an i7 2600
Intel HD graphics 2000
mind you if you're using a k-series chip
and you're not using a z68 motherboard
then you're not going to be able to use
that unlocked multiplier to overclock
and the onboard video at the same time
because h 67 does not support
overclocking and P 67 does not support
onboard video so that's an interesting
sort of situation there here's the
included heatsink it has pre applied
thermal compound as well as a copper
slug for better contact and a better
mounting pressure you can see it
slightly raised with the CPU core itself
we've got an 80 millimeter fan on the
top that uses PWM for pin controls to do
what it needs to do i'll website drop
that back in but i actually can't do
that so i'm going to show you guys the
core i5 2500 ksi said this is one of the
better values because especially for
gamers and overclockers hyper-threading
doesn't make that much of a difference
since most games out there are not going
to use more than two to four cores so
this guy even though it doesn't have
hyper threading performs extremely well
when you turn up the frequency it comes
with a little case badge as well as a
little warranty booklet with
installation instructions in there too
so remember guys this is LGA 1155 that
means you cannot please please I can't
stress this enough you cannot install
this in your old P 55 motherboard on LGA
1156 they are not compatible even though
they do look quite similar you will need
a p67 or an H 67 motherboard in order to
use this chip now we are still using
dual channel ddr3 so you don't have to
upgrade your whole platform but you will
need to upgrade your CPU and your
motherboard if you want to take
advantage of the Sandy Bridge that's the
code name second generation Intel Core
i5 and i7 processors so thank you for
