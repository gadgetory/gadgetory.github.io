perhaps a little belated but better late
than never as i like to say all the time
because that's something that i always
say the samsung 840 SSD so this is
different from the 840 pro and we
actually have a slightly unique sort of
mix of 840 and 840 pro so if you've
already seen our 840 pro unboxing you'll
know that that's the one that has beast
performance basically as good as it gets
in the market it also is in a slightly
larger capacities so it's 128 256 and
512 vs 120 250 and 500 gigs for the 840
it also comes in a slightly different
package although both versions are
available for both different drives so
this one right here our 840 pro is the
bare drive version that just comes with
the data migration software and the
drive itself are 840 is the version that
comes with the desktop and laptop
installation kit included so in this
case you have to slice all the way
through the sticker in order for the box
to come apart and I r we go good work
Linus and the drives look pretty darn
near identical on the top the only way
to tell the difference between an 840
and an 840 pro is the fact that there's
no pro here also the fact that it comes
in a different capacity it's a state of
36 gigabit per second drive it uses
Samsung's latest controller designed by
Samsung and it has oh cool oh okay so
they've got a two millimeter clip here
that allows you to go from a seven
millimeter drive to a nine millimeter
drive depending on what the requirements
are for your particular notebook that's
really handy in a desktop it makes no
difference whatsoever but it's a it's
really good to have for for a notebook
because yeah if you have the slightly
the wrong drive it just won't fit and
that'll be a bit of a problem alright so
software wise I was talking about their
controller right you know what we never
did go through this so it's using their
three core mdx controller designed by
samsung for samsung just like everything
else in this drive so the main advantage
for samsung is the fact that the
controller the firmware the flash the
ram every single thing in here is
designed and manufactured by samsung no
one else does this not intel
well not crucial nobody else does this
for example crucial is using a
third-party controller chip set so
they're writing firmware for it they're
manufacturing their own flash of RAM but
they missed that one key component and
then Intel is using sandforce
controllers so just totally totally
using I mean their own firmware for it
but totally using someone else's stuff
whereas Samsung doesn't do that it uses
toggle ddr2 NAND flash memory this is
TLC memory more on that in a moment ddr2
sdram cache memory AES 256-bit
encryption is built into the drive it
comes with their magician software which
is basically SSD performance
optimization so manual trim benchmark
testing secure erase and firmware
updates as well as their data migration
software the 840 also has a three year
warranty compared to the five year
warranty on the 840 pro it is to sign
more for a consumer work cycle then like
a prosumer a professional work cycle so
the a40 is the perfect drive for someone
like your gamer friend or your mom or
whoever else where it's more of a
mainstream customer it's less expensive
but they're not expecting that customer
to be writing you know 5 10 gigs of data
to the drive every single day because
like all SSD drives the 840 and the 840
pro have a limited number of write
cycles and TLC flash compared to NLC so
two-bit purcell flash vs 3 bit purcell
flash is inherently less durable so it's
not going to last as long so if it's
someone who's using their SSD as you
know a scratch disk or something for
working on very large video or photo
files then that's going to be a bit of a
problem for something like a non pro
level drive hence the branding a 40
refers to the generation of product so
you've got the 840 and the 840 pro for
more like a pro user or someone who's
more of a heavy user so let's have a
look at what else is included with the
840 we've got a thing that has a thing
inside there's your manual and software
download believe us from the Samsung
website if you sort of care about that
sort of thing new stickers samsung SSD
activated that kind of neat stickers i
like stickers warranty statement summary
for the 840 in the 840 pro there's a
bracket so that's a two and a half inch
to three and a half inch brackets made
of
minam so it's going to be lightweight if
you're installing it in a desktop
they've also got all the screws that you
might need in order to go ahead and do
that their installation a SATA cable is
included no way oh this is awesome these
are handy this is one of those USB two
here we go USB to SATA adapters so
instead of having see this this is the
kind of thing i like kingston had a kid
they had a desktop upgra notebook
upgrade kit where they included an
actual two half-inch drive enclosure
with the thing it was inside the SSD box
I was like really a whole two and a half
inch driving less not very convenient
because you actually have to take the
thing put it in the thing screw it into
the thing close it up and could plug
that into like the wall and then plug
that into them like really these are
awesome though this is kind of like
seagates goflex goflex external external
drives right where the whole thing is
data and power all through USB and then
it plugs into the back of the SSD just
like this so there's your state of three
interface there's your SATA interface on
the back there you just go like that you
can run the drive back up or a drive
migration tool that is provided by
Samsung and then you do your swap so you
actually leave the drive in the notebook
you plug in this one you run everything
then you swap them and you're good to go
so I think that pretty much covers it
