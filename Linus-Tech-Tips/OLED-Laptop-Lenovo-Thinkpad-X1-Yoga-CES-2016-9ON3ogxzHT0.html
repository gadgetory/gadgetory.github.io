check out the ThinkPad x1 yoga and the
Lenovo 32gig link they need a
Squarespace for sending us through this
year tickle the link in the video
description down below
being a ThinkPad there's a ton of
customisation options but you can get a
6th generation Core i7 vPro processor up
to 16 gigs of memory and up to a one
terabyte nvme SSD which is insane
the display is a 14-inch 2560 by 1440 p
panel but you can decide whether you
want it to be OLED or not if you do go
with the OLED it will cost you a little
bit more but it looks really nice and
actually weighs considerably less in
terms of ports the left-hand side has a
power connector a Express dock connector
a display port and a USB 3.0 port the
right-hand side has HDMI USB 3.0 another
USB 3.0 a combo mic and headphone jack
so a 4-pole Jack volume buttons power
button and then a stylus which pulls out
and has a charge of two hours but you
can charge it up to one and a half hours
in 15 seconds which is pretty insane and
then all the way back up to the top on
the right hand side there's a Kensington
lock slot being a ThinkPad through some
of those you know kind of standard to
think paddy features like the red nipple
mouse in the middle the dedicated left
and right clicks and the easy to find
the borders of trackpad which I actually
appreciate all of those things being a
yoga it have it has hinges and it can
flip backwards on itself but it's
actually kind of cool the keys will
recede into the keyboard when you do so
so if you want to slide it around they
won't catch on things or if you have
your hands going around the laptop
because you're holding it like a tablet
you don't actually press the keys it's a
pretty cool feature
personally I prefer the ThinkPad take on
the yoga but that I don't necessarily
prefer the price this one starts at 1449
the consumer II more version one starts
at a little bit lower I don't remember
exactly where but it's not as nice so I
don't know give and take
moving on to the link this thing is
seriously cool but not necess
completely game-changing the idea behind
it is you plug your phone into your
computer like you often would to charge
but you put this thing in between and
then you're able to control your phone
with your computer that part is the part
that's not new we've been able to do
that for quite a while but having a
direct wired connection is very fast and
it's very easy to control and Lenovo has
done some software stuff so that it's
very easy to manage
the screen on your desktop rotating when
the screen on your phone rotates and
other stuff it's pretty cool I would
like to be able to do text messages
through this I would like that a lot
that's already what I used I think it's
called AirDroid 4 so this would be a
more seamless faster solution and then
being able to just fat transfer files
back and forth very quickly and easily
in a way that's already set up all the
time because you just plug your phone in
that way to charge instead of running
AirDroid on your computer and your phone
is nice it's easy it's nicely integrated
and it's just a 32 gig flash drive that
cost $39 so you get some extra features
for not a ton of money which is kind of
cool what else is kind of cool
Squarespace build it beautiful you can
make websites pretty easily for
companies or not for companies so you
want to have a blog about your cat
that's actually pretty easy to do you
just use a template where you can have
posts on it like a blog and then it'll
work fine if you need to get a new job
because all you decide to do with your
life was make a blog about your cat you
can make a resume page it's quite simple
if you're having problems to hold that
they have 24/7 Live Support through your
live chat or email also quite simple

free also quite simple Squarespace build
