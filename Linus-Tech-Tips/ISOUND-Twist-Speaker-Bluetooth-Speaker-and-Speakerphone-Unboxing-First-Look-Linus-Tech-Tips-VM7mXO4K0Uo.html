when I did my video about it for being
expensive because it's a Bluetooth
speaker that acts at doubles as a
speakerphone
it's got lake bass and treble and all
that stuff this is a less expensive
alternative this is the twist speaker
with rechargeable battery it is
basically a speaker and speaker phone
plus like bass and treble and stuff so
slick wants me to get the packaging off
it in a hurry because it's pretty shiny
so we're just going to undress this
bluetooth speaker in a big way and slixa
fairly tired and wants to sit down
because he's trying to move that likes
stool over here so let's see what the
manufacturer has to say for themselves
it's very thick there's nothing I can do
it is Wireless okay a2dp bluetooth for
wireless music streaming with a 30-foot
range it is a speakerphone with a
built-in microphone is an advanced noise
cancellation for wireless speaker phone
calls bold sound two speakers and one
passive subwoofer auxilary input which
is handy rechargeable battery ok offers
up to 5 hours of continuous playtime now
I can tell you guys right now that is
significantly less than the jam box
however if you were paying like you know
if you were paying per minute of
playtime then the twist is still a
better deal however you also lose the
size advantage that something like the
jam box has so here we have a fairly
large speaker that is actually
apparently supposed to go this way not
the other way and here we have a
significantly smaller one and just for
good measure I am going to do the iPhone
comparison here you get the top-down
view so now you know how big they all
are um look wants me to do this there
you go so let's go through the pairing
process together and see just how just
how awesome the twist speaker is
settings Bluetooth so probably you just
like press and hold the thing right oh
it's not charged oh it's not on oh there
we go okay well why don't we take an
actual look at the unit itself so we've
got controls here bluetooth volume up
volume down power and like something
pick up the phone play pause put down
the phone you've got what appears to be
fat there's your two speakers there's
your passive subwoofer so it looks like
this is actually kind of empty space I
don't feel a whole lot in there or maybe
there's the battery there whereas most
of the business end of things is in this
particular twist so there's the twist
there's the like not as twisted parts or
when you put it on the table it doesn't
roll has kind of a soft touch feel to it
kind of like BitFenix cases let's press
on see what happens here
and it's not charged dancing makes more
sense from there's music
so the pairing process took a matter of
like seconds even for slick who had
incidentally never paired anything over
bluetooth to his phone before this is
slicks phone um mine's out of battery
from tweeting too much honestly we're
both really impressed for a fraction of
the price and like one over three is a
fraction I think so for a fraction of
the price the twist is louder and
clearer with better more um more punchy
bass than the jam box by jawbone so it
loses the compactness okay so remember
it is significantly bigger it looses the
uber battery life so that's kind of a
big deal to a lot of people if it was me
I'd probably still go with the jam box
assuming they were the same price
however they're not um and I think he
said there was another gap guy another
one oh wait no I don't know Lorne
oh yes I do another one so this isn't
even as loud as it goes however that was
as loud as we could get it comfortably
and maintain the thirty of the bass it
does start to distort eventually but not
like the damn box
it's empty in the valley of johan
masonic rises slowly as you walk away
from all the films and all the faults
you left oh there we go bit of a delay
there um so thank you for checking on my
unboxing and first look at the twist
speaker don't forget to subscribe to
Linus tech tips for more unboxings
reviews and other computer videos oh
right one more thing and what's another
thing that's great about it is that it
charges by mini-b not by stupid microUSB
which is more fragile and less
accessible there I have fewer micro
cables and I think most people probably
do as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
