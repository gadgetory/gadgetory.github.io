been meaning to try out pfSense
and there's actually a couple other DIY
make an old computer your router OS is
but I'll be I'll be trying pfSense first
because it seems to be the most common
one and so I'm using an old computer
this is an Intel 965 board I've got a
pentium for 6:30 in there something like
that four gigs of old ocz check this out
this the part number is Vista upgrade
Ram nice 80 plus bronze power supply for
efficiency a little SSD for silence and
efficiency I mean the Pentium 4 will
have to be replaced if this works in all
likelihood but I just wanted to whip
something together so I could try it out
I'm going to be using this optical drive
right here for the OS install here's the
pfSense OS disk I've got a couple of
I've got one Intel Nick and I think I
had another one somewhere and then I
have also because it's an Intel board it
does use Intel networking for its
onboard so I have the one gigabit port
there as well and then I'll be using
just a Netgear switch to do all my
gigabit switching and then I found out
of my three Wireless cards this one is
the one that has a compatible chipset
where there are drivers for the pfsense
OS so I'm trying the release candidate
one for the new version 2.0 of the
software and let's see how this goes I'm
going to get this started
my Razer Naga Mouse had to unplug it
it's causing some kind of error to do
with the LEDs lighting up or something
along those lines so I'm now in the
Installer mode I had to connect an IDE
optical drive in order to install it
this little motherboard won't boot from
USB optical very elegantly so uh mmm
here we go never done this before okay I
won't just accept these settings let's
do it quick easy install ah yeah we can
erase all the contents of this disk here
goes guys okay so I had some
instructions before it rebooted to put
in 192.168.1.1
one username admin password pfsense so I
got to do that it's asking me now this
is on first boot shows me my network
interfaces it doesn't seem VP picking up
the blend built into the motherboard so
it's possible that that's not going to
work for me I do not want to set up
VLANs hmm you can't have at least one
interface you cannot continue you should
not have at least one real network
interface card or one interface with
multiple VLANs then pfSense will not
function correctly if you do not know
the names of your information we choose
to use auto detection in that case
disconnect all interfaces now before
hitting a to initiate auto detection I
should okay Auto detection time all
right I guess I better go plug in my
guess I better plug in my modem so a few
changes have been made I'm going to
actually move over to the other room so
that I can plug the LAN interface into
my network switch and the one interface
into my router the router one seems to
be working so far but I haven't had a
chance to here are my 2 Intel Pro 100s
desktop adapters so I haven't had a
chance to to plug the LAN one in because
I don't have two cables running into
this room
I've also removed one of the wireless
cards because since the onboard
networking did not work with PF sense I
had to put in the additional wired
network port card so let's see how this
goes ok so I think I figured out the
configuration stage of things here
basically I assigned interfaces so I
sign my interfaces to the wide area
network and local area network I set the
interface IP addresses so I set my LAN
one to kind of a standard router IP
address and then I also had to set
starting and ending ranges for the DHCP
server which will assign IP addresses to
all of the computers on my network
so right now I still have my PC the Home
Server a couple other one other PC and
the house connected to my router here
but I'm actually I've got my pfSense
router connected to my network switch
there so I'm going to be using that to
test a couple other computers including
this notebook that I've hooked up to
find out if this works so actually yes
you guys can find out real time what's
going on here whether it works or
whether it does not okay actually I
might need a minute okay so it works it
looks like I have logged in from user
admin from 192 168 1 point 1 1 which is
the notebook that I've connected to my
network switch right here so I have
internet access and I have logged into
the pfSense web interface so I'm pretty
much done on this side as far as I can
tell and I have never used this before
so I'm not even going to begin to try
and talk about how to use it but yeah I
mean why don't we do a little exploring
just right off the bat here to have a
look at what we got here so we got CPU
usage memory usage which I would have
expected to be quite low we've got a
platform running here's version 2.0 rc1
which is what I am using okay here's my
interfaces which I set up already in the
command line interface system it has
certain manager firmware general setup
logo now my understanding is it's a
little on the complicated side for
networking noobs which I am one of so
yeah we're not even going to try and
begin to explore this right now but I'm
hoping to be able to figure out how to
use it
and then maybe I'll be able to provide
an update for you guys thank you for
