brought to you by Squarespace build it
beautiful next to me here I have a
gaming notebook
not just any gaming notebook a 17 inch
class gaming notebook not just any 17
inch class gaming notebook one with a
gorgeous aluminum construction but ok
hold on a second kindness all of this
stuff is kind of stuff that's out there
what about this is special this is the
first ever gaming notebook from EVGA
something that I didn't realize until I
heard about the announcement but it
surprised me that they had never done
before they're the only company I can
think of with the motherboard and BIOS
programming experience that they have
who has never taken that and turned it
into a notebook so let's run through
what this puppy's got going for her
we've got a 4k IPS display up here like
I said before just a beautiful aluminum
ID with a one finger hinge despite the
fact that this is quite a large model
we've got top-of-the-line specs we've
got a core i7 skylake processor 16 gigs
of DDR 4 RAM it's got USB 3.1 type C it
features a 256 gig SSD Bluetooth 4.2 all
of that good stuff but of course because
EVGA knows gamers they were able to come
in and do a notebook that doesn't make
many of the mistakes that companies that
are new to this stuff make for example
the keyboard has a really nice and
incredibly solid feel to it the speakers
are tuned to deliver great sound and
from closer to the gamer than you would
normally encounter and this is cool yes
but wait there's more EVGA has
implemented many of the same features
that you'd find in their enthusiast
motherboard BIOS is for example you can
move the mouse around in the BIOS you
can overclock from within the BIOS that
is pretty cool so they've actually got
like a super clock profile where you can
turn the CPU up to I think it's 3.8
gigahertz or something along those lines
and they do all of this without it
getting too
Wow that's the thing that they're most
proud of is how quiet they're able to
keep this machine under a gaming load in
terms of i/o you've got your power in
you got your Gigabit Ethernet you've got
HDMI and two mini display ports and then
moving around over to the other side
we've got USB type-c very nice to see
that type-c connector finally getting
popular here another USB 3 port a
headphone the slash microphone jack and
the Kensington lock along with another
USB 3 port now the one thing that I
think EVGA missed the mark with on this
one a little bit is that the gtx 980m
graphics card that's in here is not
hooked up to a g-sync display however
EVGA says they are looking into
releasing a follow up model with a
g-sync display later on this year so let
us know in the comments on this one guys
is there a place for EVGA in the gaming
notebook market or is it too crowded how
