net gears a readiness for home so this
particular one doesn't come with any
discs it does have a three year warranty
it's not a business grade product so as
far as the hardware spec goes it's got a
gigabit network port but it's got 256
Meg's of RAM and then a single core
melville up mail vault Melville Marvell
processor so I wouldn't expect to be
getting like huge you know hundred
megabyte per second transfer speeds or
anything like that but honestly it's
probably not what you need for a home
networking device so what does Netgear
think you should use this for home use
storage use I mean this is all these are
all sort of fairly self-explanatory
things if you guys know what an ass is
then you know it's probably good this is
the biggest bag of do not eat that I
think I've ever seen in a box it's huge
like look I don't agree you probably
couldn't eat it if you wanted to all
right moving along to the navs itself
ahem
so yeah supports a single drive failure
pretty much any tube a nas as long as it
supports raid one should be able to
support a single drive failure so that
is fairly self-explanatory I love the
way net your stuff is built like it's
like steel drive cages I've seen NASA's
that have like plastic cheesy ones it
actually feels like you know an
appliance and it's I think part of it is
because Netgear does manufacture pro
grade stuff so it's actually probably
more expensive for them to retool a
cheaper cheaper alternative solution
than to just use stuff in an existing
design they have that's very rugged and
robust and just give it to the general
consumer as well so that I appreciate
mounting wise you unfortunately don't
get the benefit of toolless mounting
because that's not really how pro grade
stuff works but I I mean how often are
you're really going to be changing the
drive in a tube ainaz unless it dies you
probably aren't going to be doing any of
that
um it's kind of nice looking actually it
looks again it looks very pro grade so
this is the duo v2 it has a USB port on
the front it has a OneTouch backup as
well as power you've got an activity LED
as well as drive indicator LEDs for both
sides
they're most of the intake is at the
front but there's going to be some air
intake on the side here as well as on
the side here and all of that is going
to be have air drawn through it with a
92 millimeter fan this is one of the
bigger fans that I've seen on a tube
ainaz because they filled up the almost
the entire back of the unit with the
cooling fan so this is great because
it's going to make it quieter and it's
also going to make sure that your drives
aren't going to suffer from any excess
heat which can cause failures over time
it has a Kensington lock as well as a
hard reset button two USB 3.0 ports on
the back this is a nice feature as well
because it allows you to expand the
storage beyond just those internal ports
or do things like back your NAS up to
something else and then store it
off-site Gigabit LAN DC power in and
let's see what else
Netgear thinks is important about this
so they're they're marketing sort of an
as as a private cloud and that really is
kind of what it is it's a way to store
all of your stuff in one place do
continuous backups on your machines have
well.ok automatic expansion I think is
sort of iffy because on a 2 bein as
there's not much you can do to
automatically expand it other than like
add more USB but there you go what's
cool is they do have a ROM mobile app so
you can remotely access your files as
well as mobile e access them and they do
have a private HD photo sharing site so
the H calling something an HD photo is
sort of redundant but having a photo
sharing site other than Facebook is
important to people not everyone's tech
savvy enough to set up like their own
like web server and had you know set up
the authentication that would go into
that so something like this where it's
more of an appliance type option could
be very convenient and then of course
these are the kinds of things that you
do have to explain to people who don't
know that there's something outside of
cloud storage you there are no hosting
fees there are no overage charges
there's no actual limitation other than
buying bigger drives if you want more
storage or adding more nas's thanks for
checking out this unboxing of the
readiness duo v2 don't forget to
subscribe - tech tips from unboxings
reviews and other computer videos I just
realized I never showed you guys what's
in this brown box I mean I probably
could have guessed an Ethernet cable
hard drive mounting screws and the power
adapter same things that are included
with
Rena's and then there's also their
resource CD which you can of course
download off the Netgear website and
their little QuickStart guide</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
