keyboard video we received a ton of
requests to review what some have called
the model M of India the TV s gold
it's a durable value mechanical keyboard
with cherry switches sort of that's been
around for many years and can be found
all over India in banks offices or
uncle's den unfortunately it is not that
easy to get your hands on in Canada so
we embarked on a month-long journey
including the help of the extended
family members of one of our viewers to
actually get one but with changes in
quality and price and competition from
China is the TV s gold as good a deal as
it used to be let's find out speaking of
gold private Internet access it's gold
but not like expensive like gold it's
just really good like gold go get it it
protects you when you're online
so here I've got an original model M
from 1986 and at EVs gold from June 2018
now it's pretty obvious that the TV s
gold took some design cues from the
model M like the lock lights for example
they are identical but there are some
notable differences though like this
fridge for example that you can use to
hold a pencil or even two pencils also
the plastics themselves are pretty
different no model ends were made with
durable high quality plastics including
PBT keycaps
by contrast both the key caps and the
chassis of the TV s gold are made of the
more common ABS plastic which can get
that kind of that polished shiny look
over time from the oils in your hands so
we were able to confirm this with a
quick acetone test going further we can
also see that the white lettering is
coming off even though the letter
outline remains that's because the
legend on the TV s gold is laser etched
which essentially means that it's got a
groove burned in the top of the key cap
then in this case it's filled in with a
colorant so this kind of lettering isn't
the most durable but it's much better
than pad printing which is what most
budget keyboards use so it should last
you reasonably well even in a
professional environment the next thing
that a lot of T vs gold users talk about
is the layout now at first glance it
looks like it has the same North
American key layout that was pioneered
by the model M but it actually has a
bigger Enter key and a smaller backspace
key which that second one in particular
can be really frustrating if you're not
used to it I actually experienced this
for myself on steel series's 7g though
with that said you shouldn't confuse
this layout with the European ISO layout
which also has a tall enter key no no
this one is actually a special layout
called index script or in script which
was ratified by the government of india
in the early 1990s and it's designed to
work with 12 different indian scripts
this keyboard by the way was also the
first one ever to have the indian route
signed printed on the legend though you
may find yourself needing to go through
some extra steps in order to actually
get it working now let's talk about the
typing experience now traditionally T vs
gold keyboards shipped with cherry MX
blue key switches so these are
high-quality german-engineered switches
with a clicky tactile feel and a
distinctive sound that makes them
beloved by typists the world over and
the fact that a keyboard that you could
usually find for between seventeen
hundred and twenty three hundred rupees
came with real cherry switches was
almost a miracle except for one small
problem sometime near the end of 2017
get off you bastard
ah yes here we go wait wha wha do they
good TV us stopped shipping golds with
cherry switches with all of the newborns
getting equipped with Chinese clones
made by kale now to be clear the kale
blue switches are still mechanical and
they actually use the same design as the
cherries you might say they ripped them
off so they still have that clicky feel
and if this is your first mechanical
keyboard you'll probably love them but
it kind of raises the question in a
world where budget mechanical keyboards
are becoming more and more available is
the T vs gold still even a good deal
especially considering that the price
has moved up rather than down into the
twenty seven hundred to thirty five
hundred rupee range I mean at that price
why not get a keyboard from cosmic byte
or red gear that has more switch options
an updated look gaining features like
anti-ghosting and windows key lock not
to mention freaking RGB so then given
the recent decrease in switch quality
and increase in price the TV s gold is
no longer the outstanding value that it
once was especially considering
competition but that doesn't mean that
it's a bad keyboard so if you like the
vintage look and you won't be bothered
too much by the shortened backspace key
then the TV s gold is still a classic in
its own right just be sure to order from
Amazon even if it's cheaper at your
local computer shop that way you'll get
a one-year warranty to protect you from
their easily crushed boxes speaking of
easily crushed I'll be crushed if you
