you decide between 4k and ultra wide why
not both introducing the LG 5k ultra
wide feat your fiestas last wire allows
you to instantly see your current and
past network activity detect malware and
block badly behaving apps on your PC or
Android device use offer code Lynas to
get 25% off at the link below
historically there have been mostly two
different pixel counts for ultra wide
monitors 2560 by 1080 which takes your
standard 16 by 9 1080p monitor and
stretches it by 1/3 and 34 40 by 1440
which does the same thing to a wqhd
monitor both of them have an aspect
ratio of 21 by 9
except it's not actually 21 by 9 it's
more like 21 and 1/3 by 9 so 64 by 27
but I guess that didn't sound as sexy on
the marketing materials and also I guess
it's easier for people to understand 21
by 9 since most people are pretty
familiar with how 16 by 9 looks so that
means that visualizing 21 by 9 isn't as
much of a stretch of the imagination as
calling it 7 by 3 would have been anyway
none of that is the point all of that
stuff pales in comparison to the beast
that we've got today this ladies and
gentlemen is LG's 34 wk 95 eww I think
the wk is for work like working it
because this thing boasts over 11
million pixels that are so close to each
other that if you tried to pass your
body between them
you would have to go through one cell at
a time it is a lot of pixels and yet LG
still doesn't call this resolution 5k
they call it 5k to K because they
already make a 5k monitor which has 3
million more pixels all in the vertical
direction so IMHO even though there are
5,000 horizontal pixels here really this
is more like a 4k ultra wide something
that we've never seen before and a true
5k ultra wide should have a resolution
of something like 68 20 by 2880 but
let's not get ahead of ourselves here
because 5k 2k is plenty sweet as it is
it's pixel density of 163 pixels per
inch is almost exactly the same as a 27
4k monitor putting it at Apple Retina
levels from a reasonable viewing
distance of 21 inches which means you
will be blown away by the crazy sharp
text assuming that is that your PC can
actually drive this many pixels so if
you're plugging the monitor into the
display port port man I wish they had
come up with a different name for that
on your 10 series Nvidia or rx 400
series or newer AMD graphics card then
you are golden if you're relying on the
HDMI 2.0 ports then you are basically
Sol you'll be capped at 30 for 40 by
1440 since even though 3840 by 2160 is
available you can select it that is a 16
by 9 aspect ratio meaning it is squish
ville so say no to HDMI as for if you're
using the Thunderbolt 3 port probably on
your laptop that's where things get
really interesting because when we
reviewed the LG 5k ultra-fine we learned
that while it worked perfectly at full
resolution with our 2016 MacBook we
could only get about 4 and a half of
those k's on a Windows machine the
reason was that the available
Thunderbolt 3 chipsets at that time only
supported DisplayPort 1.2 which doesn't
have nearly enough bandwidth for 5k at
60 Hertz it only worked on the MacBook
because Apple cleverly used the capacity
from the chipsets of two side-by-side
ports to push all those pixels through
but that changed ostensibly in early
2018 when Intel released a new
Thunderbolt 3 chipset called Titan Ridge
that supports DisplayPort 1.4 which can
handle full 5k at 60 Hertz or even 8k at
30 Hertz off of a single port so okay
that's great Linus how do I know if I
have a Titan Ridge good question if you
want a one chord solution to connect
your laptop to an external display and
potentially even charge it at the same
time what you need is both a 2018 model
laptop that has the new Titan Ridge
Thunderbolt 3 implementation you can
check with your manufacturer
to find that out and a discrete GPU
since Titan Ridge isn't designed to work
with Intel's
integrated graphics and even if you have
all that there's still no guarantee that
it will charge your laptop so if you're
a Windows user on a one cable laptop
docking feature is a big focus for you
be sure that you've got a compatible
machine or you will be disappointed oh
and by the way you can wipe that smug
lot a moustache smirk off your faces
2018 MacBook users because currently
Mojave has a bug preventing this monitor
from working properly for you - the good
news is that once these little details
are ironed out this thing will not
disappoint its color accuracy is
fantastic out of the box we measured
color differences that were on average
indistinguishable to the human eye
despite this not being a 10 bit panel
thanks in part to LG's nano cell tech
which if you're not familiar works on a
similar principle to quantum dot but
kind of the opposite so it filters out
all the colors except the intended RG
and B and its HDR capabilities are what
I would describe as not bad now bear in
mind that the 34 wk 95 u W only manages
a peak brightness of 600 nits while 1000
nits is required
IMO for a true ok this makes a really
big difference
HDR experience but at the very least it
does sport the new vasive display HDR
600 certification which demands 90%
coverage of the DCI p3 gamut a threshold
that it crosses with ease the biggest
deficiency with this panel at least on
our particular unit was uniformity
though and it was worst along the left
edge and in the corners which are a
little darker than the rest of the
display and you could also make the
argument that given the $1,500 price tag
the looks of the monitor are clean but a
little less premium than they could be
with that said though personally I'd
rather my money went towards a better
panel and backlight solution than fancy
casing for the most part
anyway so bottom line should you buy
this monitor I guess that depends on who
you are if you're a gamer you're gonna
find this thing pretty hard to drive
like especially in triple-a titles and I
would strongly recommend a higher
refresh rate lower resolution
alternative but if you specifically want
large format and very high resolution
the 34 wk 95 eww really is a best of
both worlds solution that does a
reasonable job of justifying its $1,500
price tag so go for it
because the rest of the really big
computer displays out there are 4k and
even though they have a lot of pixels at
this kind of size 4k won't be nearly as
sharp as this and for my part anyway I
prefer the ultra wide aspect ratio it's
kind of like multi monitor but with no
awesome bezels the mass drop Sennheiser
HD 6 xx headphones are one of mass drops
all-time bestsellers with over 40,000 of
their members picking them up to date
now they have not changed the driver and
sound structure compared to the HD 650 s
meaning you can expect a balanced
mid-range and natural sounding bass but
they do come with a detachable six-foot
cable instead of 10-foot based on
community feedback and a 1/8 inch plug
that is versatile for everyday use also
they include a quarter inch adapter and
support from sennheiser directly so go
check it out at the link in the video
description to join the drop and get
your own HD 6 xx headphones so thanks
for watching guys if you dislike this

also down there is our merch store which
has cool shirts I shot a lot of videos
in this shirt today that's awkward as I
keep telling people to go check out our
merch store you know what it's fine our
merch store has cool shirts they're just
not like this one and you can check out
