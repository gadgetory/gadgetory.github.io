black ops gameplay footage with the one
and only my personal favorite Mac user
the one who talked me into getting one
of these the camera man you also saw him
played dirt when when we did our
affinity with the three TVs so I
actually have the game set on easy mode
for him this is the very first level oh
he found the grenade launcher that's
good good for you cameraman so this is
what it looks like when a Mac user tries
to play a video game on a PC you can see
these noob tubing everything so you know
clearly there's no skill involved in any
of that any of what's going on here but
to hear actually hear the got crazy
Russians actually holding the camera now
and Here Come have a look at the rig
we're using so we've got our dual GTX
580 s with overclocked intel core i7
running here so that's why we're getting
buttery smooth frame rates although if
you check out my call of duty black ops
performance review you'll be able to see
that most of the graphics card solutions
on the high end are able to run this
game without really any problems we run
into CPU bottlenecks with everything
except our single Radeon 5870 config so
um I do have a 3d performance review
coming soon but I just want ru I hope
you're watching this because we're
trying to see gameplay footage right now
you are watching the cameraman struggle
right right click will look down me yeah
are you going filming you found the
scope there so that's pretty good and
yeah there you go there you go
okay so thank you for checking out our
little game play with the GTX 580 video
with the cameraman being our featured
gamer big quotation marks and don't
forget to subscribe to - tech tips
I think that's it actually here's a
little bit more gameplay footage for you
guys
cameraman is oh wow okay I was not
expecting that to happen
but I just wanted to show you guys the
game on the GTX 580 s and the more
jungle scenery style so hopefully
everybody can figure it out this time I
think he's trying to operate the melee
there we go okay that was it that was it
okay I'm running out now I'm done I'm
done burning cameraman oh God</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
