2013 is powered by Western Digital our
trusted gaming gear partner is corsair
vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCIX calm hey guys we're here at the
AVerMedia booth I really like avermedia
stuff because we actually use it for our
live stream we use the internal one for
when we're doing our general live stream
and we actually use this portable one
live gamer portable when we're doing our
gaming stream my brother's a caster he's
called cold se he wants a neighbor media
card I'm going to hopefully get him one
soon so that he can more easily stream
things it's not as much stress on his
computer one new thing that they were
talking about is you could already
record in 1080p to your computer writing
on your hard drive but now on this side
you can go and put an SD card in and
then you can wrote it recording 1080p to
your SD card with a firmware update this
wasn't initially available you can only
record to the SD card in 720p but now
you can record in 1080p which is awesome
because if you don't have a pc near you
so you're streaming on a console or
something like that like that you can
record directly to an SD card and those
can come in very very big capacity so
that's great another thing that they're
talking to me about is you can record
from pc or xbox very easily with an hdmi
cable with coming in the end off the
elders they have it currently but ps3
they have some content protection stuff
that doesn't allow you to do that but
they found another way by going through
component and with this avian cable that
they have you can now record through ps3
which is very very cool because that was
previously locked off like I was talking
like I was talking about earlier if I'm
just going to turn this right here if
you wanted to record in pc free mode
which is the mode where you're according
to an SD card you just move the switch
over there if you wanted to record in PC
mode where you're recording to a pcs
hard drive or SSD you just switch it
right like that very very very nice the
button on the top as you can see here
which is in red or not glowing because
it's not plugged in here is how you
start recording or start streaming you
can use this to either live stream or
record a media locally with everything
on youtube with Let's Plays and game
reviews and all that kind of stuff tons
of people are getting into streaming
with twitch TV which is part of our
partnership you can stream with one of
these things without putting extra load
on your computer very very easily these
things are awesome you should definitely
check them out thank you for watching
