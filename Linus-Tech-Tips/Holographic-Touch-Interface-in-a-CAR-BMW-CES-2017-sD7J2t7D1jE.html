BMW sponsored us to do last year at CES
with the mirrorless I ate that thing was
freaking unreal and well they have done
it again
so behind me is the BMW I inside future
this is like our kind of radical
reimagining of the role that and the
automobile is going to play in our lives
in the near to mid future so autonomous
driving is upon us at this point here at
the show BMWs showing off autonomous
five series prototypes that are using
ultrasonic front radar rear camera front
camera and what BMW is calling an HD map
to safely navigate to your destination
this is combined with a kind of fleet
learning that I wouldn't have dared to
dream of even two to three years ago so
BMW is not only using their own cars to
recognize and modify changes to the
route like say for example a
construction zone but they're actually
actively working with other OEMs to
ensure that everyone is using the most
up-to-date information so that means
even little details like how long you
can expect to sit at a red light you can
frisk in countdown timer can be
accurately predicted in this way and
there are additional layers of intuitive
convenience that can be refined as we
move into the future so Siri and Alexa
have been joined by prototype Cortana
integration through the open mobility
cloud and through that same network
connectivity paradigm you could even do
things like order chocolates on Amazon
on the way to a visit with Grandma and
have the driver me to Midway so you
don't even have to take an extra five
minutes to go into the store to get them
and valets in parking lots I mean even
multi-level parking lots or it would be
pretty darn difficult to use GPS
navigation for example valleys could be
replaced by robots that guide autonomous
cars to a berth and then don't ask for a
tip for their trouble but naturally you
need a very different kind of car to get
the
most out of this idea and that is where
the sculpture as they're calling it
they've been very firm with me do not
call it a car do not call it a prototype
do not call it a concept it's it's a
sculpture it's an idea so the interior
design has been dramatically altered
instead of bulky dashboards even kind of
futuristic feeling stuff like LCD
monitors and cool-looking illuminated
buttons BMW envisions a much more open
and spacious alternative this would give
the driver in the front seat passenger
room to relax and stretch out an
autonomous motor even enjoy a movie with
a similar level of comfort to home they
even allow the passengers to have
different audio experiences with what
they're calling sound curtains so these
are speakers in the headrest and the
seat that are only audible when your
head is within a very small zone and
they even include active noise
cancellation in the sound systems so
whatever music your passenger is
listening to is completely inaudible to
the driver which is great if you have
very different tastes in music from your
passengers or say you want to get on a
conference call with someone and the
passenger doesn't want the music or
their movie to be interrupted of course
though you still need to interface with
the car in driving mode BMW is still a
driving company so this is really cool
and the engineer who showed it to us was
super awesome they designed a
holographic display with gesture sensing
and haptic feedback okay so the
holographic display is visible only to
the driver
so you see buttons just floating in the
air in front of you it's pretty trippy
gesture control is handled by intel
realsense technology so the car knows
when your finger is over a button but
the craziest part and this was what the
engineer actually had worked on and she
was like really proud of this it's
freaking awesome is the array of
ultrasonic transducers or source or
speakers that feels like a mild tingling
sensation on your finger when you push
down
on a button or interact with the
holographic display it is really cool
you kind of have to try it and I'm sorry
that you guys can't you'll just have to
take my word for it in the back is kind
of like a living room on wheels I mean
obviously this is I won't use concept
phase this is sculpture phase stuff that
we're looking at here and while cork is
perhaps a realistic sustainable natural
material to use in the future moss
probably won't make it into a finished
product anytime soon but the idea of
having a tablet enabled 4k projection
screen in the back of the car to watch
movies or like a bookshelf where I can
pick something out get comfortable and
relax and read while the car takes me
wherever it is I need to go is amazing
especially for people like me who don't
really suffer from motion sickness in
the back of vehicles or while reading so
autonomous cars cannot come soon enough
