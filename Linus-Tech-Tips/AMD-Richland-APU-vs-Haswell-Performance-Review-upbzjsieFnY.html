check the link in the video description
for more details welcome to my
performance overview I guess you could
call it a review of sorts of AMD's
richland series of AP use now we only
got one of them we got the a 1060 800 K
and so we kind of went okay so this is
gonna be priced at around 145 bucks or
so sort of in bulk pricing so let's
compare that against the obvious
competition which is of course a sea
turtle well no but it felt that way a
little bit because AMD's richland is
really in a class of its own when it
comes to a low cost value gaming
platform so AMD sort of released this
richland series of AP use they're on the
same fm2 socket as the older apu so you
don't have to really upgrade your
hardware you can just get a bios update
for your board or whatever else and you
can basically drop in a Richland also
AMD has told me that we are going to be
looking at FM 2 for the next generation
of AP use as well so they haven't really
changed the platform in fact they
haven't really changed the architecture
at all so it's mostly just a small speed
bump over the last generation 5000
series like the 5800 K APU so why did
they do this my guess is it probably has
something to do with the release of
Haswell so we took the lowest cost has
well we could find and took a few
mainstream games that you might want to
play on a system that doesn't have a
dedicated graphics card and we ran them
head-to-head now with that in mind we
didn't do any compute performance
benchmarking because we already know the
Intel chip is going to wipe the floor
with the AMD one we're talking about a
very specific usage case here that is
not focused on CPU so if you want better
CPU performance go with a has well if
you want better GPU performance well
stay tuned because in Skyrim our 4430
which is an i5 44:30 intel doesn't have
an i3 yet their long
only the higher end of their Haswell
CPUs got beat by our 58 or rather 6800 K
by a whopping 10 frames per second 24
frames per second average on Richland
versus 15 now with that said the 5800 K
the last gen one was only one fps behind
this one so you can really see it's a
small clock bump and not really anything
revolutionary in terms of performance
our next game up was dirt three and in
this one Richland outperformed Intel
solution by about 75% that is fantastic
all the way from 22 fps or so to 37 fps
going for a different platform bearing
in mind this one costs about $30 less
than the Intel solution finally in
Starcraft 2 which is a very sort of
mainstream II type title Richland wins
by about 25% versus the Haswell GPU and
we see it once again very close to the
5800 K so was this the most exhaustive
test of benchmarks that we could have
possibly run no was this pretty much all
you need to know about Richland I would
say yes AMD is delivered a new chip that
goes on their existing platform that you
don't need a new board for they've
delivered outstanding graphics
performance in a CPU or APU or whatever
the heck you want to call it which
really isn't any different from what
they did last time but that fine because
what they did last time was great - I've
done a fair number of videos about their
last generation APU and it's awesome and
so I think that pretty much wraps it up
if you want to do entry level gaming and
you don't want to buy a graphics card
buy an APU thanks for checking out this
