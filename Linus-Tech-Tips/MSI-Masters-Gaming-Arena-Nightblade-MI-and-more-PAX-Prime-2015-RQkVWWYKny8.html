Prime 2015 and they are throwing one
heck of a party it all centers around
the grand final of their masters gaming
arena 2015 this is a heroes of the storm
in starcraft 2 competition that has
actually been going on since May of this
year and we are finding out actually
right behind us right now we'll be
taking home the title for heroes of the
storm and starcraft 2 is gonna be
tomorrow but the subject of this video
is the technology running the show
behind me so let's have a closer look at
the laptops that the gamers up on the
stage there are using okay so I promise
we check out the GE 62s that the
competitors are using up there but we
got a little distracted on the way
because this is the next generation GT
72 s okay it's kind of similar it's a
little bit bigger but it has some pretty
amazing upgrades over the last
generation product so first of all this
is running the all-new core i7 6820 HK
yes k over clocking on a notebook we've
talked about this on LAN show now it's
real MSI figures you can peek at around
four point two gigahertz if you
overclock on a quad core on a laptop and
you can run sustain probably in the
neighborhood of about 4 gigahertz and
the rest of the specs are no slouch as
well you've got a gtx 980 and a keg in
there it's got a 17.3 inch full HD
g-sync display it's got up to 64
gigabytes of ddr4 memory but the storage
oh the storage is where things get
really off the hook as I believe the
kids say check out this crystal disk
mark that is a read speed of 3.2
gigabytes per second on the right speed
of 1.25 gigabytes per second they are
achieving this with two PCIe 4x gen3
SSDs those are nvme SSDs haha
haha that is something that I personally
have not seen before oh yeah there are
some other upgrades right physically so
it's got a new keyboard design and
they've replaced one of the display poor
ports in the back with USB type-c with
Thunderbolt 3 capability coming in the
future the certifications not quite done
yet but the logos on there the
hardware's in there and it is going to
be ready to go very very soon okay I had
to stop and see this this is the
Nightblade am I now this isn't the first
time that we've seen ms I do a super
compact gaming machine but this is a
whole other level because you guys will
be much more impressed by it when I tip
it over onto its side and show you just
how slim this puppy is so a features
support for the latest six generation
core i7 processors yes you can stuff at
6700 k in here it's got a custom mini
ITX motherboard inside that takes sodimm
memory so they are like really going for
all the space savings they can get on
this bad boy it can hold a full size
graphics card so this particular one is
kitted out with a GTX 970 with their all
new silent storm cooling on it but yeah
it's really fast it's got lots of
cooling and all that stuff but that is
not even what's most impressive about
this bad boy to me so let's go ahead and
open her up oh wow that came off pretty
smoothly normally it doesn't go that
well for me we've got a single two and a
half inch SSD up here we've got two
three and a half inch hard drives on
these handy-dandy little sleds you just
take out two screws and you're ready to
replace the hard drive and we've got an
optical drive they fit four drives into
this tiny like shoebox-sized chassis I
mean that's freaking unbelievable so if
you do want to pick one up it'll be
available as a bare-bones in North
America so basically throw in your own
CPU and drives and like all that kind of
stuff or in other regions worldwide
you'll be able to buy it as a complete
system very nice and wrapping things up
we've got the all in one that's being
used by the commentators here this is
the 24 de tu q
and we've seen gaming grade all-in-ones
okay so yeah it's got a core i7
processor either 4th or 5th gen
depending on which sku you're shopping
for this particular one is 4th gen it's
got a gtx 960 m so you can watch videos
at the 4k resolution of the built-in
23.6 inch screen and play like
mainstream games like League of Legends
it's got enough horsepower for that it's
got 16 gigs of RAM it's got a 128 gig
msata SSD with two slots for two and a
half inch drives in this case it's got a
couple of hard drives for mass storage
but the thing that we haven't really
seen much of in the past is super slim
gaming all-in-one that's one of those
things I've always wondered why we don't
do we follow these slim gaming laptops
well on the side goes hold on a second
that's the same bloody technology why
don't we go ahead and put that into an
all-in-one and they're doing a few other
things right with this one as well that
4k display is now I PS and 10-point
multi-touch so it's got all all the
fixins as far as all of that is
concerned so thanks for checking out our
coverage of the NSI I don't even want to
call it a boof it's like an extravaganza
here at PAX Prime 2015 don't miss any of
