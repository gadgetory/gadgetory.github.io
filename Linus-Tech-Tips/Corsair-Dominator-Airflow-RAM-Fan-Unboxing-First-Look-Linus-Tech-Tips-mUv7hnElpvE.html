unboxing today but it isn't Ram this is
the corsair dominator airflow fan and
this is not the original one this is the
new one which is as you can see wide
enough for six modules to fit underneath
it now the old one was about this thick
and used little tiny 40 millimeter fans
that quite honestly were just too loud
they were obnoxious fans awful just
awful but these ones are sixty
millimeter fans on though I've never
actually turned them on I'm going to
assume they're quite a bit quieter the
optional airflow fan unit contains 260
tachometer controlled fans provide
impinging air flow to the memory
subsystem with the moderate RPMs
required to provide adequate forced air
the airflow pen is nearly silent there
you go
they say it's quiet the fan easily
clamps on to most motherboards now
something that you should bear in mind
is that you do not need to use corsair
ram in order to take advantage of the
dominator airflow fan you can actually
use it with any ram but the height that
it sits that is just right for their DHX
or their Dominator modules so I mean
arms obviously designed to work best
with their products so the first thing
we'll find inside is hopefully some kind
of installation instruction oh yeah
there you'll notice that's clever see
they've gone and they've taken that back
board and they've turned it into your
installation manual so figure one clip
on the retention levers thank you to
click over the modules figure 3 plug in
the airflow figure 4 completed so it is
a 4 step actually 3 step because the
fourth step is that it's done
installation process I've installed it
before it's really easy it comes ok
first we find the two little clips those
go on either side arm dropping things
all over the place tonight
there is another there's another clip
okay then we have Wow there there ok so
then we have the actual Dominator
airflow module itself you got a nice
long little sleeved fan connector there
that's a three pin connector so the
easiest place to plug this in it's going
to be somewhere on your motherboard into
one of the fan headers and then right in
here you have a little baggy of screws
and washers and they're mostly pre
applied to the thumb screws ok so these
are really easy to apply all you really
do is position this clip under here just
like that so you can kind of see what
I've done there and then you can move it
around to get the best positioning over
your memory
modules and then you take the little
thumb screws and you thumb them in there
and then these will be mounted to either
side then you take the whole thing and
clip it clamp it over the memory
retention clip so you don't actually
clip it to the sides of your memory
modules you pull it over just a little
bit more so that it will hold the memory
module is in place by holding the clips
anyway that was pretty much it thank you
for checking out my unboxing of the
corsair dominator airflow module I'm
actually going to give you like a couple
seconds of like close-up because like
some like some panning action here did
you check it out
oh yeah there's Corsair airflow on the
side airflow okay that was it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
