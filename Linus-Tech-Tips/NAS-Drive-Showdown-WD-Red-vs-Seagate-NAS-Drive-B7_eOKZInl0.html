learn more welcome to our nas Drive
roundup so we've got two contenders the
WD red which is the original
Naza optimized consumer grade hard drive
and then we've got the new comer the
Seagate NAS hard drive so what they both
have going for them is longer warranty
periods than a typical consumer grade
device 24/7 tech support as well as a
24/7 rated ab sort of operational
workload that's that's what they're
designed for it actually be used all the
time in a storage appliance
they're both optimized for smaller rate
enclosures so for example the red is
good for anywhere from 1 to 5 driver
rays and there's a reason for that
because as much as I have always used
just regular desktop drives in naz's
both Seagate and WD have lectured me
about this because they're like well
actually the vibrations that are passed
between the drives can be a problem in
the longer term particularly when you
pile more and more drives into an
enclosure so having drives that are
optimized for resisting any errors that
might be caused by that vibration is
definitely a positive positive thing the
one key difference between these drives
is that the WD red does tend to be a
little bit more expensive on retailer
shelves and is only available on a 3
terabyte capacity up until now and
performance of these drives in Nazz
enclosures is very much an unknown at
this point not too many people have
really looked into it so we decided to
take a Synology ds4 11 so this is their
DiskStation quad bay enclosure we've set
up a raid 5 in there with either 4 of
the red 3 terabytes or 4 of the Seagate
NAS Drive 4 terabytes and decided to run
some benchmarks because many people are
looking at these Navs drives going oh
well they only run at 5400 or 5900 or
whatever sort of eco optimized rpm
because remember in an AZ enclosure you
want less power consumption and you want
less power consumption did I say power
consumption twice because what I meant
to say was heat output for the second
thing you want less of both of those
things so running at a lower rpm
as helped achieve that but what does
that do to performance well I'll tell
you what we were expecting to happen is
we were expecting the land interface
right there that Gigabit LAN interface
to be the first bottleneck even running
in something like a RAID one
configuration which is to drive
redundancy no calculations we are
looking at about I mean we're looking at
a maximum of 80 to 100 megabytes per
second transfer speeds if we're running
in something like a raid 5 for writes
we'll be lucky to get 25 to 35 megabytes
per second write speeds which means that
a 50 900 rpm drive can keep up just fine
so the other bottleneck like I said in
raid 5 is going to be internally here
the processor raid 5 is very calculation
intensive so basically what you do is
you have at least three drives and one
of the drives worth of space is
allocated for a parity bit which is
pretty much a song that someone designs
to sound like another song and then they
actually change the lyrics to make it
more comical no no not that kind of
parity the real parity is data that can
be used to reconstruct the data on the
other drive so it's extremely cut
computation intensive when it comes
particularly to writing data to a raid
array anyway without further ado I'm
going to put some charts and graphs up
on the screen that'll give you guys some
idea but performance differences we
observed which I think really backs up
our hypothesis in a very big way
we ran several different tests including
real-world small medium and large file
copy tests and all of these numbers are
reported in the time it took to complete
the operations with either different set
of drives and then we also ran black
magics disk speed test which we've found
to be a fairly reproducible and just
kind of a quick and dirty benchmark so
that gives you a synthetic benchmark as
well as a real-world benchmark to show
you that we really didn't observe a
difference in performance between these
drives so with no real performance
difference between the drives how do you
pick which one to go with and I think
the answer is that it comes down to
trust who do you have the best
experiences with over the longer term or
the people you know or whatever else do
you want to pay more for the WD or do
you want to pay less for the Seagate or
do you need the four terabyte capacity
that's available in the Seagate WD
doesn't have a four terabyte read yet so
there's all those things to consider I
know slick just recently purchased four
of the 3 terabyte WD Reds for a personal
raid array so that should give you some
idea what we think of the red
particularly internally here and
speaking of things that we think very
highly of internally hear audible calm
so check out audible.com slash Linus you
can get yourself a free audiobook by
signing up and then you can obviously
get a subscription and after that
unfortunately they're not free but the
good news is they have over a hundred
and fifty thousand audiobooks that you
can download now whether it's older
stuff business stuff or the latest
bestseller so for example I was just
checking out the Cuckoo's calling by
Robert Galbraith or Galbraith or Goliath
whatever it doesn't matter not a real
person if you don't know this already
Robert Galbraith is actually a pen name
that was being used by JK Rowling so
there's a big controversy and all that
it was very well reviewed but wasn't
selling particularly well until all of a
sudden it leaked and someone told
someone who told someone in anyway
the point is now it's all over the
Internet's critically acclaimed even
before we knew it was JK Rowling and
receiving extremely good reviews even
now that we do know that it's JK Rowling
who wrote this particular book so it's
kind of a mystery so no no magic or
anything like that and I do recommend
checking that out guys if you go ahead
and redeem your free audio bootable comm
