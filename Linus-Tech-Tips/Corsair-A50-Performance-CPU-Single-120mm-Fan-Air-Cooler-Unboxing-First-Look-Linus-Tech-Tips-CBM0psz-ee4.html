the corsair cooling air series a 50 so
this is a performance cpu cooler not to
be confused with what i have over here
which is the a 70 which is classified as
a high-performance cpu cooler so this is
performance this is high performance
there are a couple of key differences so
what i'll probably end up doing is
taking them both out to do a quick
comparison for you they both feature
two-year warranty as well as
compatibility with LGA 775 1156 1366
clark corium 3am two and a m3 as well as
compatibility with 120 millimeter fans
Corsairs 120mm fans are generally pretty
good quality so I'd expect this one to
be much more of the same you can either
select 1600 or 2000 rpm on the fan and
here we have a little performance graph
compared to your stock cooler I can't
help but wonder what stock cooler they
were using oh here we go core i7 965
processor running at stock 3.2 gigger so
actually the LGA 1366 cooler that comes
with the 965 is a pretty decent cooler
so if it up performs that one by a
significant margin you can rest assured
it will outperform your 1156 775 or AMD
stock cooler so let's take the packaging
off just like this look at that I didn't
need a nice at all
let's still zoom dinner oh yeah that's
why you can't say they're gay here we go
how much better so the box is actually
similar in size to the a 70 but a little
bit shorter okay so you've got a boat
about 2 to 3 centimeters there in terms
of extra shortness or less length if you
prefer they're both the same sideways
dimensions so it's not really bigger in
that regard go ahead and open up the top
here have a look at what's inside with
the a 70 I tried to guess what was
inside all the boxes this time hopefully
I'll be a little bit more accurate ok
I'm going to guessed it in here is
accessories I'm sorry john-boy sure wish
I could get this stuff out of here that
would there we go alright so inside the
box we will find something to get the
box out of the light we will find all of
the accessories so we have a
120-millimeter fan which comes with
their shroud / clip that I actually
really like it makes fan mounting a
breeze and it's also got nice
anti-vibration rubber grommets mounting
the fan to the frame we've also got the
am too am free hold down thermal
compound some screws rubber washers and
a fan speed adapter fans feed well fan
noise reduction adapter so that'll turn
your fan speed down presumably to
sixteen hundred rpm here is a Corsair
solutions guide outlining all of their
different solutions including memory
solutions cooling solutions power
chassis USB and storage solutions it's
gotten to the point where as per their
dream machine campaign you can actually
almost build a pc entirely out of course
our parts so here's their back plate for
intel here's a little plastic piece to
keep the motherboard components on the
back from being shorted out you can
adjust these clips here to go from 775
to 1156 to 1366 quite easily and then
there's a hold down for the top side
along with some screws perfect so that's
all of our mounting accessories as well
as our fan accessories i'm going to hold
on
the fan for now there yeah here we go
hold on to the fan and let's have a look
at the cooler itself so it comes packed
in foam just like that it comes with a
little quick start guide which I guess
shows you how to install it on the
socket of your choice that's too much
thermal compound i would probably put on
about half of that but a plus for effort
course they're I mean they're not wrong
the only disadvantage is that you're
going to get some thermal goof around
the edges of your CPU and like it's kind
of it's kind of hard to clean off of
there it won't damage anything but it's
just a pain when you're trying to clean
off the cpu too I don't know put it back
in a box or whatever it is you need to
do do not return this product to the
store coarser wants to cover all of the
technical support customer service etc
themselves don't eat this and then we
have the cooler so it's quite a bit
smaller than the a 70 right off of that
you've got the same black top that I
really liked on the a 7d so you've got
three heat pipes coming up through it
and then instead of seeing a standard
silver or chromed top you've got a nice
black one which will go really well with
the black interior and the corsair 800d
the fins are quite tightly spaced but as
long as the fan has reasonably good
static pressure which it better because
it's I believe the same one that they're
using on the h 50 then you should get
fairly good performance out of it that
way the fan clips on that easily that's
how hard it is so you just flip it on
and then you can pull it off and clip it
on and pull it off but it is secure
enough that it's not just going to fall
off so here if I take the heat sink and
shake it around like if it was being
shipped on a truck there it doesn't fall
off excellent alright I was hoping it
wouldn't fall off then we've got the
bottom of the heatsink so this is where
we see it is a heat pipe direct touch
heatsink so that that was bad that means
that it will survive a fall from
approximately six inches above the table
and it will not be damaged because it is
engineered like that okay so I'm just
distracting you right now while I pull
the a7
the out of its box so that I can do a
quick comparison against its little
brother the 850 here we are all right it
looks a lot bigger but it's not actually
that much bigger it's just because of
the additional bulk from the fans I mean
it's a little bit bigger but anyway
let's finish off with the a50 here so
i'll do the obligatory finger shot it's
not all that shiny but it does look
quite flat although my my unmeasured
appearance o meter is not going to give
us too good an indication of that but I
would expect it to be reasonably well
manufactured I mean that is one of the
things that is talked about heat pipe
direct touch though is that when you're
manufacturing you do have to make sure
that it is aligned completely precisely
all of the heat pipes and that they are
aligned precisely with the base because
what you do is you assemble the whole
thing wish it all together and then you
have to actually flatten the whole thing
as a whole so if you go too far you'll
go inside the heat pipes heat pipes are
not solid they are Hollow and usually
full of some kind of a gas / liquid
because that's what allows it to
transfer heat so quickly so if you go
too far you puncture a heat pipe
rendering the whole thing useless and if
you don't go far enough then you're
going to lose some of the efficiency of
actually having the heat sink directly
on top of the heat spreader of the CPU
look oh there's course our logos on one
on the bottom too there's a nice
finishing touch for you you'll never see
it in all likelihood but it's there
you'll know it's there and that'll make
you feel better ok so here we are we can
compare the two heat things against each
other so the first thing you'll notice
in terms of difference is that the a 70
looks much bigger because of the big fan
I already mention that the next thing
you'll notice is that it has more heat
pipes so it has thirty three percent
more heat pipes and in theory thirty
three percent more performance although
it probably doesn't quite work out that
way let's just strip the fans off them
so you can see just how much thicker it
is I can also tell already that it has
quite a bit more surface area in terms
of fins too because what they've done
with the with the a50 is they've
actually gone a little bit okay yeah you
can see it has a slightly different
shape to it so
no you can't really see that ok I guess
the only difference here is that the a50
only has the one side that you can clip
the fan to that's kind of interesting so
rather than being shaped the same on
both sides like the a 70 because the a
70 is designed to have a fan clip to
either side you can see clip marks here
here here and here the a50 can only
accept a fan on the one side this side
is actually flat that's why it looked
like there was actually less fin
material on this side of the heat pipes
to me but it's not actually the case
although it is quite a bit thinner so
you know what I'm it's hard to say how
much performance difference you see but
maybe I'll have to actually test these
and find out just how well they do maybe
I'll test them against the coal gauge
arrow here which is this enormous
monstrosity thing some okay well I'm not
speculation they both use nice fat eight
millimeter heat pipe so that's a really
good thing to see so even though this
one only is a three heat pipe cooler
it's going to do quite a bit better than
a heat pipe cooler that uses only six
millimeter heat pipes thank you for
checking on my unboxing of the Corsair a
50 cpu heatsink and i hope you enjoyed
it don't forget to subscribe both to

other official NCIX channel and thank
