the Corsair cooling air series a 50 so
this is a performance CPU cooler not to
be confused with what I have over here
which is the a 70 which is classified as
a high-performance CPU cooler so this is
performance this is high performance
there are a couple of key differences so
what I'll probably end up doing is
taking them both out to do a quick
comparison for you they both feature two
year warranty as well as compatibility
with LGA 775 1156 1366 Clarke corium 3
a.m. - and AM 3 as well as compatibility
with 120-millimeter fans Corsairs 120mm
fans are generally pretty good quality
so I'd expect this one to be much more
of the same you can either select 1600
or 2,000 rpm on the fan and here we have
a little performance graph compared to
your stock cooler I can't help but
wonder what stock cooler they were using
oh here we go
core i7 965 processor running at stocks
rupanuga her so actually the LGA 1366
cooler that comes with the 965 is a
pretty decent cooler so if it
outperforms that one by a significant
margin you can rest assured it will
outperform
your 1156 775 or AMD stock cooler so
let's take the packaging off just like
this look at that I didn't need an ice
at all
let's still zoom dinner oh yeah that's
why you can't say they're gay here we go
how much better so the box is actually
similar in size to the a 70 but a little
bit shorter okay so you've got a boat
about two to three centimeters there in
terms of extra shortness or less length
if you prefer they're both the same
sideways dimensions so it's not really
bigger in that regard go ahead and open
up the top here have a look at what's
inside with the a 70 I tried to guess
what was inside all the boxes this time
hopefully I'll be a little bit more
accurate okay I'm gonna guest it in here
is accessories oh boy sure wish I could
get this stuff out of here that wood
there we go alright so inside the box we
will find something to get the box out
of the light we will find all of the
accessories so we have a 120 millimeter
fan which comes with their shroud slash
clip that I actually really like it
makes fan mounting a breeze and it's
also got nice anti vibration rubber
grommets mounting the fan to the frame
we've also got the a m2 m3 hold down
thermal compound some screws rubber
washers and a fan speed adapters fan
speed well fan noise reduction adapter
so that'll turn your fan speed down
presumably to 1600 rpm here is a Corsair
solutions guide outlining all of their
different solutions including memory
solutions cooling solutions power
chassis USB and storage solutions we've
gotten to the point where as per their
dream machine campaign you can actually
almost fill the PC entirely out of
course our parts so here's their
backplate for Intel here's a little
plastic piece to keep the motherboard
components on the back from being
shorted out you can adjust these clips
here to go from 775 to 11 56 to 1366
quite easily and then there's a hold
down for the top side along with some
screws perfect so that's all of our
mounting accessories as well as our fan
accessories I'm going to hold on
the fan for now here we go hold on to
the fan and let's have a look at the
cooler itself so it comes packed in foam
just like that it comes with a little
Quick Start Guide which I guess shows
you how to install it on the socket of
your choice that's too much thermal
compound I would probably put on about
half of that but a plus for effort of
course they're I mean they're not wrong
the only disadvantage is that you're
gonna get some thermal goof around the
edges of your CPU and like it's kind of
it's kind of hard to clean off of there
it won't damage anything but it's just a
pain when you're trying to clean off the
CPU to I don't know put it back in a box
or whatever it is you need to do do not
return this product to the store courser
wants to cover all of the technical
support customer service etc themselves
don't eat this and then we have the
cooler so it's quite a bit smaller than
the a 70 right off the bat you've got
the same black top that I really liked
on the a 7d so you've got three heat
pipes coming up through it and then
instead of seeing a standard silver or
chromed top you've got a nice black one
which will go really well with the black
interior and the Corsair 800 D the fins
are quite tightly spaced but as long as
the fan has reasonably good static
pressure which it better because it's I
believe the same one that they're using
on the H 50 then you should get fairly
good performance out of it that way the
fan clips on that easily that's how hard
it is
so you just flip it on and then you can
pull it off and clip it on and pull it
off but it is secure enough that it's
not just gonna fall off so here if I
take the heatsink and shake it around
like if it was being shipped on a truck
there it doesn't fall off excellent
alright I was hoping it wouldn't fall
off then we've got the bottom of the
heatsink so this is where we see it as a
heat pipe direct touch heatsink so that
that means that it will survive a fall
from approximately six inches above the
table and it will not be damaged because
it is engineered like that okay so I'm
just distracting you right now while I
pull the a 70
out of its box so that I can do a quick
comparison against its little brother
the 850 here we are alright it looks a
lot bigger but it's not actually that
much bigger it's just because of the
additional bulk from the fans I mean
it's a little bit bigger but anyway
let's finish off with the a 50 here so
I'll do the obligatory finger shot it's
not all that shiny but it does look
quite flat although my my unmeasured
appearance ohmmeter
is not going to give us too good an
indication of that but I would expect it
to be reasonably well manufactured I
mean that is one of the things that is
talked about heat pipe direct touch
though is that when you're manufacturing
you do have to make sure that it is
aligned completely precisely all of the
heat pipes and that they are aligned
precisely with the base because what you
do is you assemble the whole thing mush
it all together and then you have to
actually flatten the whole thing as a
whole so if you go too far you'll go
inside the heat pipes heat pipes are not
solid they are hollow and usually full
of some kind of a gas / liquid because
that's what allows it to transfer heat
so quickly so if you go too far you
puncture a heat pipe rendering the whole
thing useless and if you don't go far
enough then you're gonna lose some of
the efficiency of actually having the
heatsink directly on top of the heat
spreader of the CPU now look oh there's
course our logos on on the bottom -
there's a nice finishing touch for you
you'll never see it in all likelihood
but it's there you'll know it's there
and that'll make you feel better okay so
here we are we can compare the two heat
sinks against each other so the first
thing you'll notice in terms of
difference is that the a 70 looks much
bigger because of the big fan I already
mention that the next thing you'll
notice is that it has more heat pipes so
it has 33% more heat pipes and in theory
33% more performance although it
probably doesn't quite work out that way
let's just strip the fans off them so
you can see just how much thicker it is
I can also tell already that it has
quite a bit more surface area in terms
of fins - because what they've done with
the with the a 50 is they've actually
gone a little bit okay yeah you can see
it has a slightly different shape to it
so
no you can't really see that okay I
guess the only difference here is that
the a 50 only has the one side that you
can clip the fan to that's kind of
interesting so rather than being shaped
the same on both sides like the a 70
because the a 70 is designed to have a
fan clip to either side you can see clip
marks here here here and here
the a 50 you can only accept a fan on
the one side this side is actually flat
that's why it looked like there was
actually less fin material on this side
of the heatpipes to me but it's not
actually the case although it is quite a
bit thinner so you know what I'm it's
hard to say how much performance
difference you'd see but maybe I'll have
to actually test these and find out just
how well they do maybe I'll test them
against the Cole gage arrow here which
is this enormous monstrosity thing it's
okay well I'm not speculation they both
use nice fat eight millimeter heat pipe
so that's a really good thing to see so
even though this one only is a three
heat pipe cooler it's gonna do quite a
bit better than a heat pipe cooler that
uses only six millimeter heat pipes
thank you for checking on my unboxing of
the Corsair a-50 CPU heatsink and I hope
you enjoyed it don't forget to subscribe
