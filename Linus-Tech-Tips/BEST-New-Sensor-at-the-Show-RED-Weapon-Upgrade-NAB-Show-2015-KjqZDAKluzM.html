camera market you have likely heard of a
little company called
red line is tech tips coverage of NAB
2015 is brought to you by Sennheiser
kingston SD cards and lynda.com over the
years red has worked their way up to
becoming one of those sought after
cameras to shoot on embracing an upgrade
path for all owner operators of their
products the new red weapon stays true
to that upgrade mentality building on
Reds most recent camera the red dragon
the weapon upgrade adds some welcome
physical changes starting with the i/o
instead of being on the bottom recessed
into the body the weapon has now moved
the i/o of the camera to the right side
making it much more accessible for all
the different inputs which I am sure
will please many owners that purchase
the upgrade red has also redesigned how
the weapon handles cooling moving the
exhaust to the old position of the i/o
and adding a new dual fan intake to the
top of the camera the new cooling system
is also claimed to be significantly
quieter than the previous dragon body
the mycampus that were previously on the
camera have been replaced with two
scratch audio mics built into the camera
allowing users the option of not needing
an external audio mic for running
in-camera audio the weapon also brings a
slight processing improvement that is
claimed to improve the detail and noise
levels of the shadows by roughly half a
stop another welcomed addition is the
weapon can now run a limo into cat5
cable for external recording to fast SSD
media speaking of fast SSD media the
weapon will now be using Red's new mini
mags which come in three capacities 240
512 and one terabyte recording options
have stayed mostly the same with the
addition of all flavors of pro res
recording giving a new level of
flexibility in terms of post-production
with this camera along with the red
dragon 6 k2 weapon upgrade red announced
their new 8k Vista vision sensor this is
to be the slightly larger than
full-frame sensor that will support a
new aka resolution and likely pushed the
image quality of that dragon 6 can't
even further this sensor isn't coming
until later in the year but it will be
the next step in the upgrade path
following the current dragon owners
upgrade to the weapon with this new
weapon upgrade red looks to be really
pushing the envelope of image quality in
their cameras I'm excited to see what
the new aka Vista vision sensor will
have in store for future productions
