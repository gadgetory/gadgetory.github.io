our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality pc
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
linksys we've got Jeremy from sony
Mobile to tell us about the Xperia Z
this is a 1080p smartphone with a 5-inch
display that has a number of pretty cool
features Jeremy tell us what makes this
thing so special so some of the cool
features on this guy first before I give
them power on the screen something like
the Omni balanced design so very square
very kind of cool sharp images or sharp
corners on it it's a fully tempered
glass front and back on the decisive
very overall cool design we've got a
milled aluminum power button on average
most people are hitting their power
button on their device about 67 times a
day to bring it in and out of standby
mode so why not make it something cool
and standoffish and also something that
like just overall is really cool and
easy to use and you give you that whole
Sony look to it I don't want you to
power it on quite yet can I haven't
actually held this yet oh wow so this is
probably this is actually a lighter or
maybe the same way to something like an
iphone 4 isn't it alright see smell you
around the same weight yeah it's but
it's got to be pretty close it feels
actually lighter to me in spite of as
you guys can see the significant size
difference so obviously something like a
double glass approach on the front and
back is something we've seen before but
with the iphone 4 it added a lot of
weight and you could see that Apple when
went away from that with the iphone 5
but because you guys are using tempered
glass you don't have to worry so much
about having such a thick piece of glass
then so once I turn on the display
you're going to see that it's a
beautiful 5-inch 1080p full or high
resolution or high definition excuse me
display we've got 1920 x 1080 resolution
and it's driven by the bravia 2 engine
so the bra v2 engine is what's going to
give you that higher contrast better
picture better saturation better blacks
overall once i unlock the device you get
right into the sony user experience with
the sony you I you can see it's very
nicely laid out moves very slow very
very fluid and very nicely you can
customize it very easily as well if I
just pinched on the screen I'm now going
to access to all my home screens and I
can customize them however I want so in
the past you'd have to drag and drop
your apps from your from your widget
taskbar from your app
now you just can click on your apps and
I can simply throw them right onto my
home screen if I want to delete a home
screen or out of home screen I can
simply just press the X button it's
going to get rid of that home screen for
me so tell us about the durability so
durability in terms of this device one
thing that's really really cool with it
is is water resistant so you can
submerge it up to 1 let's go to the demo
okay let's go the dome now what I really
meant was in terms of the durability
because we were planning to come and
look at the water resistance demo later
but i just want to show you guys very
briefly what kind of an io sort of
structure we have it's got an aluminum
frame all around it so durability wise
it should be as good as almost anything
else with the tip yeah absolutely i mean
it's with any smartphone you obviously
want to throw it off a building or
anything like that but it should be
pretty durable I'm pretty strong for
anything you're gonna throw at it I mean
I'm a huge fan of the whole glass on the
front and the back thing because what I
love about glass is that you gotta
really work at it to scratch it whereas
with plastic if you're a galaxy s3 owner
and you're not using a case at guarantee
your phone is scratched to high hell and
back microsd expansion is included and
next to the power there's just a volume
rocker but other than that the design is
very minimalistic so so yeah your
headphone jack everything is hidden
because of the water resistance
everything everything is hidden
underneath and it's all water seals so
that we can throw it in the water we've
got a little wide demo right here so if
i press this button it's gonna dunk the
phone in the water pull it back out you
can dunk this into water up to one meter
for up to 30 minutes and enough is gonna
happen on the phone so we're just gonna
wait for it to dip in one more time
you're gonna see it is totally working
that is a real phone thank you very much
Jeremy nobis I'm Gus this was very
helpful guys don't miss any of our CES
