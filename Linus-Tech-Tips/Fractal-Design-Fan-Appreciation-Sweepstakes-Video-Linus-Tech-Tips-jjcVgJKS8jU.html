with you if you go to the there we are
facebook.com slash fractal design and a
Facebook page you can click on this
little guy right here which will show
you absolutely nothing so apparently I'm
having trouble finding their their
sweepstakes but they are actually doing
a giveaway that is open worldwide here
it is the fat appreciation sweepstakes
that gives you a chance to win one of
the pcs that they had on demo at their
CES booth so it was built by the
legendary bill owen himself of MN pc
tech and let's just see if i can find oh

already covered who built this
particular modded pc so that was
billowing the tribute system is worth
over four thousand dollars so this is a
BF 3 tribute system and the runner-up
prize package is worth over 500 bucks

pyro SSD 8 gigs and viper extreme
division to memory and a fractal design
arc mini case and hopefully if you win
those things you'll come to MC IX and

components to go with it that's that's
one of the things that I always get a
kick out of when someone wins like an
SSD at one of our grand openings they're
like oh cool now i can buy a new pc so
actually everyone kind of wins with
giveaways like this let me just see if I
missing anything oh yeah if you share
the contest with your friends I believe
you can get bonus entries so let me
figure out how that works

encouraged to share the contest as you
will receive three bonus entries each
time one of your friends enters the
contest so I'm going to go ahead and
like us at the top of the page to see
the entry form ok I wonder if I'll win

located on the three hidden puzzle
pieces how do i enter ok soldier ok so
you have to do this in order to enter
