it's not really it's sort of an unboxing
like this is all the stuff that was in
the box at a home automation product
from Insteon so right here this is the
smart home hub so this guy right here
communicates with your smartphone via
Wi-Fi or they communicate with each
other on RF and over powerline but you
have to actually have sort of the the
part of home thing that you can connect
to via your phone so this right here
isn't always on outlet okay but this guy
right here communicates with everything
else the starter kit comes with the hub
arrange extender as well as one dimmer
module which you just plug into an
outlet and then it dims whatever you
plug into it preferably something like a
lamp and not a computer or something
like that so I have some of the breakers
off in my house so things are a little
dark so I'm gonna put on my you can
switch to infrared mode if you want so
you guys could see what's going on
do
everyone should have a hat like this so
you can see here I have taken oh
actually first of all here so I put the
extender in there so the range extender
is right there which means throughout my
entire house I should be able to access
it with my phone and then there's a
dimmer module around here somewhere I
wish I could show you guys what that
looks like I think it's upstairs anyway
so here's a regular switch so you
regularly 50 we have replaced that with
the Insteon switch so you can see right
here it is a little bit sort of more
more different from that one it's sort
of bulk here at the back a lot of
electronics going on in there so I'm
gonna go hit the break room well okay
something to bear in mind guys is be
careful whenever you're playing around
with these boxes make sure the power is
off and make sure you know what you're
doing I'll be back in just a moment so
guys this gives you some idea of some of
the cool stuff that available so these
remote controls can you can use without
a smartphone however you do still need
the wireless transceiver module sorry
sorry yeah so either a smartphone or
something else can connect to it you can
get thermostats there's another range
extender wireless motion sensors door
and window sensors so you can have it do
things like take a picture with your
security camera when your front door
opens every time or you can have it turn
on a light from dim to high when you
have a wireless motion sensor go off you
can have it do things like Oh scenes are
cool so you can set up scenes so like if
your living room you make a scene that
changes all the lights in the living
room so that maybe it leaves on one
light over here and turns everything
down when you're going to watch movies
so just go see a movie done it turns
everything off so I'll show you guys
what the app looks like I haven't
actually tried the remote itself but
check this out it should be fairly
obvious which one is the high tech one
now that they're installed it logs into
the insta on software automatically so
here's your favorites but there's a few
different things so you can change some
settings you can check in seriously who
cares
you can add devices so front door hall
light there you go
there's my movie time scene so check
this out first of all it still functions
as a normal switch okay you can see it's
just a rocker like it doesn't actually
switch into position there you go and
check this out so you go into the app
you go to whatever devices you have
frontal har switch off and yay for demos
that work until there we go
front door oh no I haven't had it do
that before so they go on off I'm gonna
turn it on and then I'm gonna go to the
scene for movies because obviously I
don't want this light right here on if
I'm gonna watch a movie right there so
if I go scene movie time movie time on
everything should go off if the whole
house is done up but right now I only
have one light switch done so let me
turn the light back on let me turn light
okay I guess they just do this right um
so there you go guys that's sort of the
the concept here I'm gonna set up a
couple of different sorts of scenes and
I'm gonna do like a tech tips video
about it but I think these things are
pretty cool I believe they have I
believe they have things like
receptacles although I'm not a hundred
percent sure about that I know they have
things like water sensors so you can be
like send me an email if the water
sensor goes off and stuff like that but
yeah check it out guys I mean this home
automation thing is it's real it's
coming it works I mean seriously I think
it works don't forget to subscribe
finest tech tips from our unboxings
reviews and another computer I mean this
isn't a computer at all but whatever
it's cool
I should clarify guys there's lots of
different kinds of switches so there's a
dimmer well switch which is not the kind
that I have there that's an on/off
switch and then there's also keypads
with dimmers so you can set up different
sorts of notices do the places existing
well switch works like a conventional
dimmer switch tap up and down also works
as a remote controlled switch so you can
works with any in stay on remote control
blah blah blah there keep Adam switch so
you can program stuff and send signals
to other entity on devices so you could
set up scenes for
toy room like as you go into the living
room one of your dimmer switches instead
of using your phone or remote control
you could just go move you time and
control everything else in the room or
you could just go just this one and it
would just control that very cool stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
