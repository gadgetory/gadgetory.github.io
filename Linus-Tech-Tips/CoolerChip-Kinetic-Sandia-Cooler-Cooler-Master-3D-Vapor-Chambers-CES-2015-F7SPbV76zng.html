brought to you by phantom glass visits
toward ontem glass for the best iron
screen protectors out there as well as
HyperX kicking things off in the cooler
master suite we've got well cooling
technology how very unexpected this is
something that they're calling 3d vapor
chambers now it's not the first time
that we've seen cooler master throw
vapor chambers onto a CPU cooler vapor
chambers actually you can learn more
about them here we've done an entire
episode of our fast as possible segments
on them but basically they are usually
flat now 3d vapor chambers are not flat
in fact they are three dimensional what
they've done is they've tacked on what
appear to be normal heat pipes but
instead of just having heat pipes
soldered to the top of a vapor chamber
that then makes contact with the CPU for
optimal heat spreading here they have
actually integrated the heat pipe
structure into the vapor chamber so
unfortunately we don't have any live
demos running yet but we do have a very
early prototype of one that has both the
traditional heat pipes on top of a vapor
chamber design as well as 3d vapor
chambers running up through the heatsink
fins and we can be expecting to see a
little bit more about this technology
around the Computex time frame but the
really revolutionary technology and that
it spins see haha it's a joke it's a
joke about cooling is right here and
this is from a partner of cooler masters
called cool chip these guys are showing
off a completely different way of
cooling CPUs now at first glance this
might not really look like anything
special okay it's got a flat surface on
the bottom that's what you stick on top
of the CPU GPU or your forehead or
whatever else it is that you need to
keep cool and then it's got some fins on
the top that are you know well spaced
for dissipating heat and then normally
you would throw a fan that's usually
about the same thickness as the heatsink
itself to go ahead and blow air down on
that bad boy and remove it from the
metal but no this works completely
differently what it actually does is it
spins the top there we go let's just
take this thing apart it spins the top
of two plates around and that is what
generates the air flow that cools model
so we don't actually need a fan anymore
at all and you're kind of probably
looking at me going well hold on a
second line is how the
does that work I mean if these two
plates aren't connected to each other
then how are you even going to transfer
the heat to it that sounds completely
inefficient will actually hold on a
second no because with precise enough
manufacturing they can actually make
these interlocking grooves between these
plates be so close to each other that
even as they're spinning around heat
transfer is basically unimpeded now this
isn't the first time that I've heard of
this technology although I have to admit
no with my skepticism had on I wasn't
convinced necessarily that it was ever
going to make it to a cost-effective
sort of retail type product because the
sandia cooler youtube video that has
over half a million views has been out
there for a couple years now but this is
the first time I've seen it actually
working and they do have it actually
working so that one doesn't work that
one you can take apart just for four
demos but normally they would actually
be fixed in place so that even dropping
the unit wouldn't cause it to not
continue to function correctly
so here they've got a prototype this is
attached to a piece of plexi
where they've got there to get their
kinetic cooler in the middle and then
they've got a more traditional heatsink
thin array with heat pipes around the
outside so they can actually increase
the performance of this design by
leveraging the airflow that they already
have from the kinetic cooler to remove a
little bit more heat this is the kind of
thing you might see in an aftermarket
more well compact enthusiast type grade
product then over here they've got a
live demo where they've got to see
identical heat elements and they've got
a cooler design they've been working on
for quite some time for one use server
or rackmount designs and then they've
got a more traditional heatsink and fan
blower design that also has to fit
within that very very low profile sort
of form factor so check this out this
one is running dissipating all the heat
it needs to dissipate so I they won't
quote me on this but based on that
they're saying this is probably in the
sort of 90 to 100 watt range I would
have to guess that this is designed for
kind of 65 watt CPUs then they've got
another one right here on the left that
requires a fan in order to achieve the
same temperature
and I think we've made our point now one
new coolers aren't always the quietest
things in the world but as far as
showcasing the potential of the
technology I think this does a pretty
good job
speaking of showcasing potential
technology one of our sponsors for the
show today
phantom glass these guys make darn good
screen protectors they are so clear and
so natural feeling that you'd almost
swear that it's just the Gorilla Glass
that's on your phone and you'd be right
because it's just a layer of Gorilla
Glass that goes on top of your phone
they've got a nano coating on the bottom
of the glass that makes it virtually
impossible to install with bubbles you
can take it off put it back on in case
you screw it up or you need to arm a
your phone and you don't want to you
know throw away that money you spent on
a screen protector and get a new one
once you get the new one back they're
available at stores phantom glass
they're linked in the video description
I also want to do a shout out for HyperX
those guys are we're a big part of the
reason we were able to come to the show
they've got a lot of great gaming
content on their YouTube channel it's
youtube.com slash HyperX you'll find the
link for that as well in the video
description thank you for watching don't
forget to subscribe so you don't miss
any of our CES content we'll see you in
the next booth or suite or wherever I'll
travels take us</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
