of gigabytes updated p55 lineup so
they've kind of renamed some of their
older boards they put an A in the title
and what that stands for is their new
three three three on board acceleration
blah blah blah basically USB 3.0 SATA 3
or SATA 6 gigabits per second and also
power 3x so what that means is they've
upped the power and their USB ports to
three times the specification laid out
by the governing bodies that specify
that sort of thing and what that means
is that even if you plug in three
devices to one port you won't run out of
power like if you're using a hub like a
non powered hub okay so let's have a
look at the accessories included with
this port we've got an IDE cable for
SATA cables then we have an SLI bridge
it's a flexible SLI bridge we have a
gigabyte case sticker okay then we have
a Dolby home theater sticker then we
have the i/o shield nicely color-coded
for you there no it looks like we got a
couple eSATA ports on this board and
there we go it even labels the USB 3.0
ports but I'll show you those in a
minute
driver CD don't use this download the
latest drivers the usual deal then
you've got the manual this is for the
p55 ATU d4 as well as the UD for peel
though I couldn't tell you the
difference between those boards off the
top of my head they're smart six user
guide smart TPM user guide and
multilingual installation guide book in
black and white awesome okay so then we
take out the mid plate and let's get to
the board itself I mean the big features
of this board versus the older p55 you
d4p are obviously v SATA 3 as well as
USB 3.0 but those aren't the only
features present so it's quite similar
looking to the older board but let's
start with the basics so here's your CPU
socket now this is a load hold down here
and those have become more popular
because there was a there's a bit of a
thing going on with the Foxconn ones
that people were complaining that under
very high overclocking conditions it
might burn out your pins and so there
they are adapting to that kind of a
change in the market
here you can see we've got our 12 phase
power design they've upped the ante from
the old UT for P which was an eight
phase power design here's our little
cover on their kind of Aztec looking
sort of Northbridge heatsink and then
we've got another cooler on a couple of
chips down here we've also got our SATA
3.0 those are the white ports the other
six are just SATA 2.0 ports and those
are powered by the Intel chipset
okay so last but not leavin close to the
end of this I'm just kidding okay so
here we've got our PCI and PCI Express
expansion ports these two are sli ready
you can run them at 8 X 8 X PCI Express
2.0 and then let's see what else do we
have here we've got our usual support
for up to excuse me the 16 gigs of ddr3
then we have our power here this is our
24 pin and then our 8 pin power over on
the top left of the board now let's get
around to the backside of the board the
i/o shield so there we have one of those
I love these these are fantastic it is a
combo USB ahsorry combo USB combo ps2
mouse or keyboard port few people are
using both ps2 keyboard and mouse but
it's nice to have one port then we have
a boatload of USB ports USB 2.0 2.0 2.0
2.0 2.0 3.0 so these are the fast ones
these are the ones that are running at 5
gigabit per second five gigabit 500
megabit per second wow I'm not having a
bit of an off 5 megabit per second I'm
having a 5 gigabit per second off night
folks anyway we've got a couple Gigabit
LAN ports and then a couple eSATA ports
a couple firewire ports a couple digital
audio ports and then 7.1 audio ports and
it is late and I'm gonna go to bed and
thank you for checking out my unboxing
of the p55 8u d4p
that was painful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
