intel core i7 quad-core processor i7 930
so this is a replacement for the 920 as
you may know if you already watched my
unboxing of the OEM 930 which is the
exact same chip but not in a box it's
just by itself and the unboxing was very
uninteresting because you just it was
that chip and there was no box okay so
why don't we have a look at everything
it says about this particular CPU so
first of all we have a frequency of 2.8
gigahertz then we have socket LGA 6 1366
the i7 938 Meg's of cache 4.8 qpi
transfer frequency ok all of the
information about the batch as well as
the serial number is right there so why
don't we get this show on the road and I
can't believe it I still don't have a
knife I forgot to get a knife that's ok
I'll just I'll just rip the sticker it's
all good
seem slow going but I'm making it happen
here we're putting the sticker step by
step step by step trying not to wreck it
too much there we go all right so
there's another UPC code here not sure
what that's for and we'll flip this over
and out it comes so the first thing we
will find is the installation
instructions as well as the three year
limited warranty this is a difference
between a retail chip and an OEM chip is
that a retail chip comes with a
three-year warranty whereas an OEM CPU
actually I believe it's only a one-year
warranty and it should be through the
retailer or the system integrator that
you buy the CPU from so that means that
you do not have any Intel warranty on a
om CPU it also includes an Intel Inside
logo label see back panel right there
just like that's all shiny and nice I
really like these Case badge stickers
next we will find whoa look at that it's
like wow ok that's been um why don't we
look at the heatsink first and we'll
just kind of sweep that over there okay
so the heatsink mm-hmm Wow looks like an
80 mil fan it's a four pin pwm design
it's your your bone stock standard intel
box cooler for the
1866 socket they haven't really made any
changes to speak of it has blades that's
been like this and if they're plugged in
backwards I guess they would also spin
like this okay you have the four push
pin design so that means that when
you're installing it it should be turned
this way that way and then when you want
to remove it you turn it in the
direction of the arrow and then pop it
up okay so that's pretty straightforward
on the bottom you'll find a copper slug
in the middle not a real slug like a
like a copper piece of metal not like
oozing thing that goes across and then
you will find thermal compound
pre-applied it's actually pretty good
thermal compound I tested this against I
think it was MX one Arctic cooling MX
one and they were so close in
performance I couldn't believe it but
this is good stuff that's on here okay
and then you find a CPU which looks just
like every other 1366 CPU except for the
writing on the top which I'm not sure if
you'll actually even be able to read
through the camera but you'll try okay
so that says i7 930 and then at the
bottom of the CPU you will find no
markings whatsoever but what you will
find is pads so those are the contact
pads that make contact with the pins in
the CPU in the CPU in the motherboard
see pins CPUs used to have pins and
that's what makes me say pins when I'm
talking about a CPU quite quite
frequently but now it's motherboards
that have pins and CPUs that have pads
whereas before the motherboard had a
socket and now it doesn't really I mean
it still has a socket like it has like a
lever and a little like clamp that goes
down but it's more like it's more like a
clam going over over a CPU so basically
if you wanted a CPU mounting guide it
would be like this but on a motherboard
thanks for checking out my unboxing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
