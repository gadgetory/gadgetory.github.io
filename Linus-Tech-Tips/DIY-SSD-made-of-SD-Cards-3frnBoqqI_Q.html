product that really makes no sense to me
at least on the surface this right here
is I've actually got the product page up
behind me this is coconut cookie cake
get in here check this out check this up
this is the I don't know Highland star
microelectronic anyway we ordered it
from usb dot Brando dot-com and this
doodad right here adapts as regular SATA
interface with some controller from Sage
that I've never heard of to 10 micro SD
slots that's quality right there so yes
my friends today we're gonna make our
own SSD
today's videos brought to you by tunnel
bear the simple VPN Tritonal bear for
free at tunnel bear comm /l tt we're
gonna have that linked below so step one
is gonna be some aren t effing em
because while it does seem fairly
straightforward in principle you take
the 10 micro SD cards that kingston
graciously sent you because you're a
famous youtuber and then you install
them in all the things i do want to make
sure that we are doing it correctly so
instructional note number the first you
can use 1 2 4 8 or 10 micro SD cards at
one time it does not support 3 5 7 or 9
instructional step number ii insert the
micro SD cards into the micro SD slots
one by one as the order shown on adapter
where's th p0l i just seek on TF 1 TF 6
TF 2 I think that's for trans flash why
does this PCB say demo on it okay well
we're just gonna we're just gonna go
according to the numbers
so where's here's TF 1 let's do this
thing wait doing this write down and
then you slide it there we go
so the idea here is that it runs all of
your micro SD cards which aside from
being a much lower grade typically than
the NAND flash that you would find in an
SSD are fundamentally the same thing
it runs them all in raid 0 to make up
for the fact that a typical micro sd
card will be capable of anywhere from
you know 20 to maybe 80 to 90 megabytes
a second reads and writes whereas a
typical SSD especially a SATA 3 one can
saturate a SATA 3 interface at around
you know 500 mm 50 or so megabytes per
second one problem that I do foresee
though is that there's more to life than
sequential performance when it comes to
SSDs and the Caen
troller dictates what the random
performance will be like and oh that too
ignores the other problem which is that
the flash on a typical microSD card is
not only slower but also less resilient
than the higher quality stuff on a
normal SSD a problem that is compounded
this is all about the problems with this
thing Hey
compounded by the fact that you're
running this whole thing in raid 0 so
one dead micro SD card means
there goes your data it's got so there
it is for better or for worse this is
now a 1.2 terabyte raid 0 micro SD SATA
SSD I don't know what it is let's plug
it in this is so dumb it's like cool but
it's like why there it is
don't weigh 1.1 6 terabytes of useable
space let's call this drive letter k has
it special so I'm actually a bit of a
loss now because I'm gonna let you guys
behind the curtain for a second here
while I was prepping this video I
actually realized that this probably
wasn't going to work because I hadn't
gone through the instructions ahead of
time and I just noticed that it says
right here do not support uhs-1 and
these are quite clearly uhs-1 cards so I
was expecting to like go on a field trip
to Best Buy and come back but it's
working so let's let's test it I guess
ok so if I told you we have the world's
stupidest SSD special k drive here
how would you benchmark it it's 10 micro
SD cards on a PCB
we could use crystal is broke Jews at oh
yes I'm coming into this with literally
no expectations whatsoever
actually at 512-byte that's right even
that bad is it this is that a queue
depth of eight though so to be clear
this is very unrealistic for a desktop
were close okay so there's a couple of
takeaways here number one is that our
drive is indeed SATA to and number two
is that the performance is actually
better than I expected
but this is just sequential this doesn't
really tell us anything about how it
would perform in a real-world workload
let's head it with crystal disk mark
just for lulz oh wow um we're still
gonna run the pass mark test I guess but
this is not looking good for random
performance this is performing about
like you'd expect from a bad SSD four or
five years ago because there's a lot
more to SSD performance than just taking
a bunch of NAND flash and writing to and
reading from it in a parallelized manner
to get more speed out of it the
controller intelligence has to be high
in order to get better oh wow these
random numbers these are awful okay so
for our last trick pass mark just thread
test so the average latency here doesn't
really tell us the whole story because
where you really feel the slowness of a
drive is when it when it spikes that's
what most modern SSDs are really trying
to overcome this those spikes and
latency that's when you like click on
something and you feel like your
computer's like so we are seeing spikes
up to almost half a second on this drive
with a lot of them actually sitting here
around a fifth of a second so while you
could run an OS on this thing I really
wouldn't recommend it and to drive that
point home I've actually spent the last
half an hour waiting for Windows to
install off a USB Drive
and it's still at 81% of getting files
ready for installation this thing is
kind of painfully slow like to the point
where I'm having a really hard time
figuring out what its purpose could
possibly be because you might go oh well
you know maybe disposable data that you
need to be faster than a hard drive but
not as fast as an SSD like a steam game
library but even then the cost is so
high to fill this thing with 64 gig or
128 gig microSD cards like we did would
cost more than just buying a proper SSD
like a crucial MX 500 or a WD blue so
I'm not sure why it exists but it does
and it's cool so there it is and you
know what else is cool Dollar Shave Club
if you have it for whatever reason
signed up for Dollar Shave Club then now
is a better time than ever for just five
bucks they are offering their shave
shower starter set it includes their
executive razor as well as three trial
size versions of some of their most
popular products their body wash their
shave butter and their one wipe Charlies
butt wipes after the starter set
replacement cartridges are just a few
bucks a month's so head over to
dollarshaveclub.com slash lightest we're
gonna have that link below and join the
club so thanks for watching guys if you
dislike this video you can hit that
button but if you liked it hit like get
subscribed maybe consider checking out
where to buy the maybe not that this
thing but maybe the SD cards and and
that site actually where we got this has
lots of other cool random gadgets as
well so you can check that out at the
link in the video description also
linked down there is our merch store
which has cool shirts like this one and
