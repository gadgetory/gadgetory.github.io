quick look at the all-new ATI Radeon HD
5830 this is a part that is positioned
sort of between the 57 70 and the 58 50
but it is more like a 5800 series than a
50 700 series hence team name so this is
from power color it is a PCS Plus which
is I believe their branding for
overclocked video cards it has one
gigabyte of gddr5 memory something about
unleashing the gaming power and it also
has DVI HDMI and DisplayPort like all of
the other 5800 series cards so around at
the back you can see it is powered by
ATI Radeon 58 30 it has a 256-bit memory
interface PCI Express 2 DirectX 11
stream technology supports crossfire and
it better for the price built-in HDMI
with 7.1 surround sound and all of this
basically looks like the same stuff it's
funny they didn't even mention I
affinity here but Eyefinity is here so
you can run up to 3 displays I also have
a guide on how to set up Eyefinity you
should probably check that out at some
point and why don't we start getting
this on packaged hey the plastic is off
its naked sort of oh I don't have a
knife I never have a knife see and I
think someone actually took the knife
that I keep in this room so I'm gonna go
ahead and just like stab through the
protective sticker with a pen just kind
of yeah we're making things work there
we go
the box is officially opened and now
it's naked nope no it's still got
another box see this is this is like an
unbox bucks box bag thing because there
are lots of boxes and bags ah another
bag ok well why don't we start with the
accessories you gotta be kidding me
this I have never seen something like
this before I thought maybe it was a
joke but I figured it out now this is a
banana digital King best CDR 52 X
compact disc recordable from goshi
digital it is a grade recordable CD
and it is for high-speed driver so if
you drive fast and you are ok so there's
something some data burn to it I'm gonna
go ahead and assume that this is the
latest drivers so for the first time
ever I'm actually going to recommend
installing the driver that comes on the
CD because they clearly downloaded the
latest driver off the ATI website burn
it to a CD and there it is ready for
your installation so thank you power
color for actually the attention to
detail of giving us the very latest
drivers for this brand new card I'm
going to assume that any future
iterations of the 5830 are going to come
with a real driver CD but that's still
pretty funny alright so what's next next
we have an installation guide alright so
the installation guides quite long it's
in a wide variety of languages it shows
you how to install a graphics card in 8
times 2 is 16 different languages and
I'm going to go ahead and close that
right back up while the cameraman tries
to look at it oh hey I actually folded
it out to the English side check that
out so we have a 57 50 there for their
demo ok next in terms of accessories we
have a part of the box that I can't
figure out how to open actually ok and
in here we have a crossfire bridge and a
DVI to VGA adapter ok so not not a whole
lot going on in there let's just put
that back ok let's have a look at the
card itself this is the exciting part
now something to note about 5800 series
5830 cards is that there is no reference
cooler design in fact there is no
reference design so what a reference
design is is it's a standardized PCB and
a standardized heat sink that ATI says
ok this is what we recommend that you
use and most launch cards are actually
like 99% of the time based on a
reference design but ATI doesn't have a
reference 5830 so the board partners
were left to come up with whatever they
want in this case power caller has put
together a very attractive looking card
like a 92 millimeter fan with one two
three count on for heat pipes coming out
the top to spread the heat evenly
throughout this fin arrangement which we
can actually see more clearly from this
side so check that out so you got four
heat pipes going across the core of the
GPU and then they come out here here
here and here for really good cooling
that's actually kind of a neat shot you
can see the structure of the heatsink
there if you look down at it from that
ankle so this is a PCI Express 16 X card
all right now you've got a lot of enough
angles there oh I like this too check
this out
okay most cards for the 5800 series have
the vrm or the voltage regulator module
cooling integrated into the same metal
chunk that cools the RAM as well as the
GPU but you can see we've got a separate
heatsink here and I actually prefer that
method because VRMs they get hot but
they don't actually produce a lot of
heat so as long as you've got some
incidental airflow and a separate a nice
well secured you can see they've got
actually three pegs through this thing
to make sure it stays nice and well
attached heatsink you can actually
remove more heat that way can you see
that pretty good awesome two PCI Express
16x connectors and I don't like this
these this is quite a long part actually
and you can see that these are coming
out this side so that means you have to
account for an additional like you know
couple centimeters out the back of the
card to make sure that it can fit in
your case I mean as long as you've got a
pretty good performance case that's nice
and long then you should be alright
okay Ram so it has one gig of ram and
you can see the ram is actually not
directly cooled but it's all positioned
underneath that 92 millimeter fan so I
wouldn't worry about that getting hot at
all at the top of the card we find two
cross fire fingers okay remember when
you're running two cards it's actually
you can see better performance if you
just use one crossfire bridge and then
at the back of the card there's not a
whole lot to talk about the whole
heatsink assembly is held on by four
screws okay four screws actually those
are kind of funny scale okay there's
lots crews you can just use a slot
screwdriver for that okay never mind
nothing don't look at that okay here we
have DisplayPort HDMI and DVI so the the
old 5800 series cards usually had two DV
is right here and here but you can just
use DVI and HDMI to DVI
cable or adapter remember they are in
terms of signal they are identical so
you there's no quality loss there's
nothing like that and then DisplayPort
if you want to run a third monitor you
will need either a DisplayPort monitor
or an active DisplayPort to DVI adapter
you can't just use like a passive cable
and then they've actually got I like
this - they've got actual slots here for
the air to escape out of your case even
though based on the design of the cooler
I can tell you already that not all of
the air will be directed in this
direction a lot of it'll go here a lot
of it will go here but at least we're
exhausting some air thank you for
checking out my exhausting unboxing
speaking of exhausting of the Radeon HD
