three contestants each of which has been
challenged as part of their final quest
with the building the dream setup they
submitted in the first two rounds so
there were a couple of it can't be part
of the video yeah you could be part of
the video Jos weeks okay it's Austin so
hey guys it's Austin let's go do
everything like this just like holy yeah
sure we'll tie her legs together the
whole day will be three-legged race okay
get out of my intro so each of them had
to do a $2,000 dream set up including
the LG 34 you see 89 G gaming monitor so
this is our first contestant Taylor he's
got a mad shout-out to his wife for
putting up with his bull crap over the
last couple weekend was working on these
videos got a man shout out for your son
who he was in the second video he was
one of the little noobs and he is
working on what was it biochemistry yeah
I get my PhD in cell biology and
biophysics it's going good so you should
be able to handle building a computer
you know that's not something they
trained us how to do now Zachary our
second contestant computer video making
clearly you're pretty damn good at it
but were you guys like actually for
serious blacksmithing yeah we're amateur
blacksmith with a beard like that you're
an amateur blacksmith we had we have to
look the part okay so give us give us a
couple facts about yourself well I'm
studying astrophysics we're all physics
here so holy crap okay
must've been a requirement and are you
much of a gamer yeah absolutely awesome
well that's good news because the
monitor that is part of Zachary's
ultimate dream set up here run set a
hundred and forty four Hertz talk and
overclocks to a hundred and sixty-six
Hertz because this thing is g-sync
meaning no stutter no tearing no
 all right you can start
unboxing your $2,000 rig and as soon as
I say go you can start building okay
sorry I should have had you just open
this I'm sorry
yeah yeah why was I blaming myself when
there were perfectly good other people
to blame true I've got two arms I'm just
lazy
you know what yours is getting the rough
unboxing treatment so here it is here's
your monitor and you can go ahead and
pull up all your stuff whoever builds
the best system and we're gonna be
looking at their component selections
we're gonna be looking at the way they
put it together everything from cable
management to the way that they did
their hair this morning whoever builds
the best system gets not only the $2,000
system to take away with them but also
eight thousand dollars in additional
gear all right okay ready yeah okay
three two one Clark oh my god
so what's your stick I see you brought
your own box cutter
the weird part is how I got on the plane
the right thing is I broke federal law
to get here so tell me about what makes
your rig optimized for what you're doing
with it well I try to make sure that I
had a fast enough ram that was good for
the i7 which is 2400 makers okay and I
used my extra money to dump into an
overclocked 1080 TI which is very
essential for 3d rendering Zach do you
go by Zach yes okay not zachary nope
things are going a little rough for you
right now yeah you need some help can I
help you want me to help you with the
eye shield not allowed to I don't know I
have to ask you went with a b-series tip
set on an unlocked processor see there's
a secret to it I don't think anybody
knows that it's because I'm stupid tell
me why you would use that part of your
budget
for USB extension cables I need one
no but it's for its for the secret
weapon actually it's not really a secret
weapon everybody knows what this
interesting I gotta say I've tried Toby
eye tracking have you and from a gaming
perspective I was not too impressed I'll
just leave what
do you waste huh actually hold on I'm
actually serious can I see this for a
second yeah I think there might be a
bent pin in your socket though this
thing is like mangled there's a bunch of
bent pins here and there's a bent pin
here this is this thing brand new yeah I
just took it out of the case ah okay so
so here's the plan it's like not new but
it's z170 which shouldn't have any
performance impact on your system
but like dude you got a bunk motherboard
we don't want to take any points off for
that so but one thing you're missing is
the critical feature that everybody
needs in 2017 can I can I have a minute
so you went small form-factor why I did
go ahead keep working but this is being
hosted by LG and it's about the monitor
so I wanted a case that would stand out
and look like the monitor so or
something with curved side panels and
this is the thing to do so wow that is a
hell of a lot more fun than I would have
put into it I came here with the mindset
of trying to win the whole thing and so
I did kind of build this around the
competition more than anything else I
see there last time I was here you
didn't have your motherboard in the case
and I helped you install your i/o shield
and you still don't have the motherboard
in a case you want for the i/o shield
it's all squishy you just need the
appropriate tools so yeah I'm gonna show
you a motherboard installation trick
that I picked up back in Nam you can you
can press on it pretty hard like I think
you're being a little bit time so ginger
yeah and so then all you want to do is
just check I couldn't help noticing that
you've got our GB RAM on and on RGB
motherboard yeah I really should have
thought about that
you really should have planned ahead a
little bit better all right how you
doing
you seem a little stressed I'm a little
hot yeah yeah it's you man I'm glad you
got something with Aris ink because this
build is sunk so so far your build is
going kind of uneventful II I'm sorry
so uh you tried to convince us that this
flame band thing is flair but it's that
was a lie yeah it's hot in here
so Tyler lineThe oh let me see if I can
find something to criticize this one has
two connectors on it you didn't need
this one at all ouch
that was all I really had like you
haven't done much so there's not a lot
to criticize I've been very flippant so
far but we actually have to decide who's
walking away with the thing totally um I
think Zack so the motherboards a big
oversight it's a big oversight
oversights like I've been giving Taylor
 about you know his broken
motherboard or whatever yeah Zack
actually like scratched up the back of
his board so did it in here's what I
actually don't like about Taylor's build
he designed it to win instead of
designing it to be a balanced build I
don't think we can talk him for that
I think we can I think is that part of
the competition the idea is to build
your dream setup I think John has the
most balanced build it does him in the
budget he managed to get an unlocked
processor an overclocking capable board
and a 1080 Ti so he's got as good a
graphics card as anyone else and if you
talk to him about what he's planning to
do with it it all makes it total sense
perfect sense I think John Taylor pretty
even for me right now I feel like
they're both fairly close there's a lot
that can kind of go wrong or right with
either of them all right
you've gotta wow you've got a lot of PCI
Express connectors connected right now
I'm not doing it no the cable management
scoring is done now though but it's it's
not like a score out of a hundred it's
like kind of more of like a subjective
score so this I'm just I'm giving yours
like a business in the front party in
the back kind of it's like a naked party
in the back though it's like everyone's
writhing or
kind of party I'm gonna go judge some
other people look at this this guy is
you're built as a logo disaster right
side-up logo okay right side-up logo
right side-up logo what the hell is this
they install that at the factory Oh
having a lot of factory problems today
so your mo so this is playing too many
factor times a fluke the second time is
a pattern sir
I think that's the third time so yeah
you know what I'm not an expert on math
okay Zack how's progress not too bad you
got your water cooler in mm-hmm
very nice that is mounted correctly you
got thermal paste in there got your logo
right side up he's got his logo right
side up Tyler jackass is what it is
Wow your cable management is really
coming along that is looking really good
now let's do that I had to grade it
before it's fine that's a shame dude you
broke the USB three header I'm telling
this not me these manufacturers have it
out for me you know what I shouldn't
have called you jackass before I
actually feel kind of bad about that
because what I should have called you
was captain excuses those my nickname in
high school
with any luck like it's just not gonna
turn on at all all right you're powered
up you're the first one to be powered up
but what you didn't know is that part of
the lightning round is for us to short
out the first lobe argon just kidding
only Tyler Taylor see he actually
screwed me up only Taylor gets to have a
broken another board today freakin
awesome man no keyboard detected though
no keyboard detected press one time
drift for one tender set up yet this
this is what's wrong with the PC
industry
Wow you've made a lot of progress since
the last time I was here thank you
cable management looks good in the front
you know I I was a little worried about
about you getting done in a reasonable
amount of time here and then you kind of
pulled it together man it's looking good
dude not a bad little system yeah and
it's on which is an improvement over
Taylor how do you show you the greatest
piece of this whole build how do you
have a secret weapon - I do it's called
a background that's yes Wow
that is just about the most like overly
masculine thing of all time this might
take several minutes AK but that's okay
because you are actually the entire
Windows installation process ahead of
Taylor over there he was way out ahead
did you really put this 20-sided die on
your power button you are actually the
last one to start your windows install
you were way ahead of the game you need
to still overclocking cable management
or should be
you got to download your drivers alright
that's okay you still got time we can do
this we actually I guess it is we at
this point okay so hold on so what have
I not done in your system I you
installed your power supply let's take a
moment to reflect on the fact that none
of our contestants managed to kill the
monitor this video brought to you by LG
ultra-wide alright so everyone's ready
yes I'm ready running you're ready are
you ready
Fortin thing yes judgement time I was
just waiting for it were you waiting for
it that time I was not so for Ghost
Recon we're running at the native
resolution of these monitors as 2560 by
1080 and we're using the ultra preset
because we figure for 2-grand
you should be having a pretty ultra
gaming experience now one of the things
that we're gonna be looking for is not
just being able to run the game but
being able to run it at a framerate
where you're gonna be taking advantage
of these high refresh rate monitors so
gentlemen hit it and let's have a look
at those benchmark scores Oh
oh here comes sixty five seven sixty
five nine and fifty three point four
okay it is basically tied you guys are
gonna have to run it like medium details
to get all those juicy buttery frames I
think that it did pretty well I have a
really nice graphics card a really good
I seven processor one of the advantages
I have over them is that I have a
Corsair or name-brand keyboard and mouse
and I also brought along a headset and a
mousepad I thought everyone was doing
that I could have saved that money and
put it into a trident RGB Ram set it's
that way I could have had a much nicer
looking build overall I think I did
really well I've got a decent build I
kind of went for more value spread out
throughout the build I wanted
peripherals that will last a while I
wanted an immersive experience but to
use a monitor for an immersive
experience I figured you would probably
need an extra peripheral so that's why I
chose the Tobii eye tracker yeah my
whole thing was based on immersion I
feel like I did worse than I could have
if I had had the original motherboard I
planned for I think I managed to pull it
together alright I'm hoping that Linus
and Austin give me a little bit of extra
credit knowing that I had to go through
a few broken components so we'll just
have to see
all right so third place is Zachary you
you fought hard the scores were super
close actually it was actually we
basically agreed on almost everything
yeah the performance hurts you the good
news is that you come out of this with a
wicked awesome gaming rig and hopefully
you had fun today and you get this dope
ass trophy gonna put this on a resume
you can put it on a resume yeah there
you go number two is pretty obvious when
you do number one that makes sense so
why don't you give each of us one of
them randomly all right two out of ten
210 for these guys before we announce
the winner you guys all did really well
it was close you guys had such similar
sort of setups you obviously ran into a
lot of bottlenecks and sort of issues
but you handled it really well and most
of them weren't your fault so you know
that was really well done but John you
took it home wonderful and Taylor you
fought hard and you were a lot of fun to
hang out with today you were okay too I
mean it's done it doesn't really look
like a check I don't think she can't go
catch this yeah yeah is this 21 by nine
home let's get a validation here no it's
not congratulations though I think you
did a great job
you put the system together really well
you had no real issues with time
performance was the best I think you
have you know RGB and like the lighting
and color is all completely on point the
configuration was pretty much what I
would have built yeah so good work good
work good work thank you guys so thanks
to everyone for coming and participating
even Austin even though I don't like
that guy and especially thanks to LG for
sponsoring ultra light festival 2017 and
thanks to you guys of course for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
